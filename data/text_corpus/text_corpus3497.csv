17485,water the most vital resource negatively affected by the linear pattern of growth still tries to find its positioning within the emerging concept of circular economy fragmented sectorial circularity approaches hide the risk of underestimating both the preservation of and impacts to water resources and natural capital in this study a game changing circularity assessment framework is developed i e mswca the mswca follows a multi sectoral systems approach symbiotically managing key water related socio economic i e urban water agro food energy industry and waste handling and non economic i e natural environment sectors the mswca modelling framework enables the investigation of the feedback loops between the nature managed and human managed systems to assess water and water related resources circularity the three ce principles lie at the core of the developed framework enabling the consideration of physical technical environmental and economic aspects an indicators database is further developed including all the relevant data requirements as well as existing and newly developed indicators assessing multi sectoral systems circularity the mswca framework is conceptually applied to a fictional city facilitating its understanding and practical use graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords circularity assessment framework water system ecosystem services human and nature managed systems circularity performance indicators 1 introduction water in the environment follows a natural circular model that secures water resources by regulating water flow and ensuring water quality however in human managed systems that follow a linear model of economic growth water is successively qualitatively degraded after use becoming unfit for further use both by humans and ecosystems stuchtey 2015 to decouple economic growth and development from imprudent resource consumption the alternative model of circular economy ce is been promoted aiming to achieve resource efficiency to reduce waste production and to improve environmental economic and social sustainability european commission 2015 to stimulate ce uptake water phosphorous and metals have been identified by hislop and hill 2011 as key priority resources beyond its necessary preservation water is a carrier of energy and materials the most obvious connection between water and ce is seen in the transition of wastewater treatment plants to resource recovery facilities motivating the recovery and valorization of treated wastewater materials e g nutrients organic matter etc and energy efficiency zhijun and nailing 2007 sgroi et al 2018 voulvoulis et al 2018 other non conventional approaches that could enhance resources circularity are the use of alternative water sources e g rainwater and stormwater harvesting etc the decentralized sanitation and reuse model and the ecological sanitation model abu ghunmi et al 2016 however fragmented management and implementation of such models is unlikely to result to desired outcomes from a ce perspective a more holistic water circularity approach is proposed by five corporate bodies i e mckinsey company international water association arup antea group and ellen macarthur foundation in three white papers i e stuchtey 2015 iwa 2016 arup et al 2018 the authors have identified the need for an integrated water management approach from local to river basin encompassing different sectors i e systems approach differentiating between water functionalities i e resource consumable durable to enable reuse and recycling symbiotically managing resources i e water materials and energy and considering the multiple interactions between nature managed and human managed systems three ce principles were developed and adapted to sustainable water management i e regenerate natural capital keep resources in use and designing out waste externalities in an effort to create a common basis for the development of a ce framework for water arup et al 2018 the regenerate natural capital principle aims to ensure functional environmental flows and stocks the keep resources in use principle focuses on closing the resource loops and the design out waste externalities principle targets at the economically efficient reduction of waste nika et al 2020 however such an integrated approach would require to overcome existing barriers integrated water management requires application of integrated models enabling systematic analyses to investigate interconnections synergies and antagonisms between the different sectors and resources villarroel walker and beck 2012 as well as the feedback loops between the technosphere and the biosphere integrated management and modelling further indicate the need for data sharing availability and security ludwig et al 2014 moreover successful implementation of ce in water requires innovations promoted through a social and institutional context as well as the establishment of appropriate regulations and standards heshmati 2015 although in many cases innovative technologies are already available e g resource recovery from wastewater hindered ce implementation is attributed to the lack of planning and design methodology capable to identify the most appropriate solutions tailored to individual cases van der hoek et al 2016 difficulties have been also identified in valuing environmental benefits against economic costs as well as the relationship between environmental practices and corporate competitiveness and profits in an effort to find the right incentives for companies to implement ce sartal et al 2020 the latter becomes more challenging for water valuation as current water pricing policies do not account for external costs i e externalities related to economic social and environmental aspects greyson 2007 hislop and hill 2011 in this study a comprehensive analysis of water within the concept of ce is being conducted in an effort to address current challenges through the development of a game changing circularity assessment framework the proposed multi sectoral water circularity assessment mswca framework follows a multi sectoral approach focusing on both economic and non economic i e ecosystems sectors and symbiotically managing multiple resources it reveals the complex interconnections and interdependencies between the different sectors in this work the term sector is used to group the resource oriented activities of an area that support the economy and have a direct or indirect impact to water resources the mswca applies integration of models and approaches for circularity assessment in line with the three ce principles covering physical technical environmental and economic aspects an indicator database has been developed as part of the framework allowing data circulation and enabling comparability of different systems a qualitative showcase of the mswca framework in a fictional case study is also presented in this work allowing a better understanding of its implementation and use 2 water circularity 2 1 water in the centre of ce naturally the hydrological cycle is influenced by weather climate and physical characteristics of the area i e land and soil formations vegetation and geology meaning that land use land cover lulc and climate changes significantly impact the hydrological cycle ma et al 2008 a disrupted hydrological cycle directly affects ecosystems species and therefore biodiversity which in turn is critical to water and nutrients cycling lange et al 2019 hydrological cycle alterations are further induced by water withdrawals resulted from the various socio economic activities e g agriculture accounts for 69 of the global water withdrawals industries for 19 and municipalities for 12 fao 2016 additionally water with degraded quality that is returned to the basin i e qualitative withdrawals may result in substantial chemical and biological consequences to human health ecosystems and biodiversity davis et al 2016 but also to amenity and economic activity fig 1 illustrates the interdependencies between the different socio economic and non economic i e natural environment sectors the feedback loops occurring in the naturally interconnected system show that any change has an inevitable effect to all the different components of the system i e the ripple effect everard 2004 thus water is the ultimate systems challenge although this ripple effect is increasingly acknowledged in various cases water management is still fragmented everard et al 2016 socio economic sectors are artificially divided with water being managed at sectoral level and seldom at river basin level and considered as an isolated component of the ecosystem an example of the ripple effect caused by sectoral management can be seen in china s policy to address food security by achieving self sufficiency of 95 that resulted in irreversible depletion of water resources and in increased stresses to ecosystems and biodiversity ghose 2014 the transition to a holistic and integrated water management at river basin scale was the rational of the european water framework directive 2000 60 ec wfd which in spite its initial recognition as a ground breaking environmental directive failed to achieve the initial targets the failure is attributed to the lack of efforts towards the implementation of the systemic approach mandated by the directive voulvoulis et al 2017 the systemic approach appears as a prerequisite for ce emf 2013 raising concerns of amplified risks and not reaching the expected results to water resources ecosystems and biodiversity in case that efforts are concentrated in sectoral rather than integrated management in this context the development of a holistic circularity assessment framework is required that would enable and support a strategic circular water management approach the mswca framework is encompassing both socio economic i e water energy agro food other related industry and waste handling and non economic i e ecosystems sectors to overcome the issue of fragmented water management 2 2 circularity prerequisites the effective implementation of circularity involves the identification of clear circularity pathways e g water circularity focuses on using the right water from multiple water sources i e surface and groundwater desalinated water industrial brine and wastewater rainwater and stormwater greywater and blackwater for the right purpose to the right users in a synergetic combination of centralised and decentralised water systems such approach implies the application of different water functionalities stuchtey 2015 that enable a targeted and effective multi sourcing recycling and reuse of water however in many cases the circular models do not fit as the arisen challenges are not technical but rather policy related leading to difficulties to make a step change therefore the actual implementation of water functionalities requires the establishment of water quality standards and appropriate policies and regulations at both the centralized and decentralized levels supporting the concept of water circularity circularity performance assessment additionally requires the specification of clear circularity targets presented as ce principles by arup et al 2018 i e regeneration of natural capital keep resources in use and design out waste externalities the ce principles indicate the consideration of environmental technical physical and economic aspects in the assessment as well as the symbiotic management of water related materials and energy the world forum on natural capital defines natural capital as the world s stocks of natural assets which include geology soil air water and all living things the natural capital principle aims to ensure functional environmental flows and stocks keep resources in use ce principle targets the reduction of extraction abstraction of natural resources and minimization of waste generation by closing the water water related materials and energy loops within the system the design out waste externalities principle targets the reduction of negative externalities by turning them into positive outcomes externalities can be both positive e g monetary value attributed to clean water biodiversity etc or negative e g monetary value attributed to pollution and result from producing or consuming a good or service any kind of waste and or emissions solid liquid gaseous potentially causes environmental impacts translated to negative externalities thus waste reduction and reuse result in reduction of negative externalities and in potential increase of positive externalities the mswca framework enables the incorporation of the three principles to holistically assess the target system 2 3 symbiotic management of resources and dynamic interactions water feedback loops and the associated ripple effect require the implementation of systems approach by using multi sectoral analysis however water can be seen not only as a resource but also as a carrier both in the human managed and nature managed systems e g nutrients are diluted in water thus their transport fate and natural cycling is controlled to a high extent by water while in the human managed systems various substances including nutrients minerals metals and other are concentrated in used water which can be seen either as a cause of pollution or as an opportunity for resource other than water recovery valorisation and reuse energy embodied in water can also be recovered and used holistic multi sectoral assessment implies the simultaneous investigation and management of multiple resources i e water energy nutrients and other materials as they flow through the different socio economic and non economic sectors however symbiotic management of resources at multi sectoral systems increases the complexity of managing supply and demand due to numerous supply and value chains more complicated and dynamic interactions and incorporated processes between them and various environmental economic social and regulative aspects to adequately describe the behaviour of the system and enable the circularity assessment covering all different aspects integration of methods models and metrics is required nika et al 2020 the intrinsic purpose of circularity is to reduce the amount of resources used by increasing their recirculation and reuse i e closing the resources loops which indicates the need for quantification saidani et al 2019 therefore material flow analysis mfa and substance flow analysis sfa are widely used to assess circularity pauliuk 2018 moraga et al 2019 they systematically quantify the flows and stocks of materials in systems differentiating between flows of goods e g drinking water and flows of substances contained within these goods e g nitrogen pivnenko et al 2016 on the other hand the effects resulted by closing the resources loops i e consequential circularity need to be investigated as well which has led to an increased use of lca based methods to assess this aspect saidani et al 2019 while mfa can be applied at different levels of sophistication enabling its use in complex systems lca generally neglects the feedback loops between the anthroposphere and the biosphere weidema et al 2018 hindering its use in complex systems where interactions between socio economic and ecological systems are of major importance feedback loops are observed at different time scales resulting from fast i e occurring over days and years and slow i e occurring over decades and centuries processes ward et al 2019 a fast process is water withdrawal or crop yield while a slow process is change in biodiversity consequential circularity is therefore suggested to be assessed by coupling natural and human system models in an effort to investigate and predict complex system behaviour emerging from non linearities time lags and unexpected results caused by feedback loops natural system models are referred here as numerical models to simulate the natural system s behaviour and dynamics nika et al 2020 presented a variety of hydrologic and biogeochemical models to simulate water and nutrients or solutes transport fate and cycling other types of natural system models including ecological models such as modelling of biodiversity change or water quality models etc also exist and may be required to be coupled on the other hand human system models vary from analytical tools such as mfa and lca and more complex agent based models to capture human system s dynamics by incorporating market processes human decision making and behaviour integrated modelling or nexus approaches to deal with interdisciplinary issues emerging from ce and water related concepts e g sponge city or even from water management are increasingly acknowledged in the recent literature for example available tools investigating interlinkages between different sectors are suggested to be used as city circularity tools in the review paper of paiho et al 2020 however the reviewed tools mainly focus on the socio economic sectors while natural environment is underestimated by not being an integral part of the analysis on the other hand nguyen et al 2020 incorporate ecosystem services in the developed integrated assessment framework but as the focus is on sponge cities it lacks models or approaches targeted at assessing circularity in human managed systems li et al 2018 developed a watershed modelling framework to represent the coevolution of the water land air plant human nexus in a watershed but the investigation of circularity is again out of the scope of this study working towards the direction of integrated approaches the mswca framework allows the assessment of multi sectoral systems characterized by interdependencies and feedback loops it suggests the integration of mfa lca and economic models for the socio economic sectors i e human system and hydro biogeochemical model s and ecological indicators modelling for the natural biophysical system to investigate the natural system s dynamics and behaviour within a single modelling framework however the purpose of the developed framework is not to specify the exact models both the number and the modelling software to be used but rather to recommend concepts and modelling approaches that are required for a multi sectoral systems assessment there is not a unique combination of models and tools as the most appropriate natural and human system models are case specific for example if natural ecosystems such as forest form a major component of the studied system then biogeochemical models considering macropore flow of phosphorus may be more appropriate compared to the studied system in which agriculture plays a major role with conventionally tilled soils where macropore flow is less pronounced pferdmenges et al 2020 additionally the number of the models and tools to be coupled should be decided with cautious the higher the number of coupled models and tools the higher the complexity of the integrated model is impeding its application therefore the mswca framework considers the interconnections between the different sectors in terms of water energy nutrients and other substances materials flows and enables the incorporation of feedback loops in terms of physical responses and not human behaviour between the different socio economic sectors and between the anthroposphere and biosphere as well more complex agent based modelling that investigates the human system s dynamics can be coupled to the integrated model at a later stage if necessary 2 4 common baseline for data requirements the effectiveness of integrated water management depends on accurate information resulted from a holistic assessment while the effectiveness of the assessment framework depends on securing access to accurate data from different sources fig 2 collection standardization homogenization and exploitation of the multiple heterogeneous and fragmented data sources that are required for a holistic multisector circularity assessment is not trivial historical data are conventionally collected for different purposes from diverse disciplines following various methodologies and structure resulting in inconsistent forms resolution and terminology water data are currently trapped in silos rising issues of data accessibility ownership trust interorganizational competition security and privacy for data sharing among the interested parties in many cases there is also a lack of consensus on relevant data needed to feed the frameworks resulting from different philosophies in data importance regarding environmental data related to nature managed systems there is a two tier data regime there are fields with very good protocols and metadata e g weather and climate whereas there are fields that are underdeveloped in terms of data requirements and reporting e g nutrients cycling ecosystem services etc therefore decision makers are often hindered to compare management options make informed decisions balancing economic social and environmental interests and subsequently evaluate and prioritize potential solutions to overcome this bottleneck common data policies data management infrastructures and shared data systems are required between public and private decision makers stakeholders and practitioners therefore an indicators database including every data instance required for a holistic approach is developed within the mswca framework 2 5 data gathering and models uncertainty there are several levels of uncertainty associated with the modelling process from the input data i e quality reliability data processing protocols to the model or sub models structure i e conceptualization inaccuracies omission of significant mechanisms ill defined boundary conditions and the linkage between different water subsystems or between human sectors and the natural environment i e gaps in knowledge on the interactions between human natural systems and their boundaries issues with the integration of fast and slow process dynamics between natural and human systems the robust quantification of uncertainties and risks of the model outputs increases the predictability and practicability of the model and helps decision makers to develop an understanding of the reliability and impact of the uncertainties on the model estimations the complexity of an integrated circular water management assessment model increases with the increase of sectors and components i e agro food energy waste natural capital mapping of the uncertainty sources their magnitude and their relationships is a significant step in the analysis uusitalo et al 2015 the holistic model should consider uncertainties from the different water sub systems modeled and uncertainties due to the coupling of the sub systems tscheikner gratl et al 2019 however there are differences in the perception of uncertainties across the environmental modelling and integrated water modelling community and across the different water sectors and a standardized methodological approach to identify quantify reduce report and communicate uncertainties is still missing bach et al 2014 montanari 2007 vanrolleghem et al 2011 an overview on uncertainty sources for the integrated water modelling can be found in the study of tscheikner gratl et al 2019 whereas a practical approach for the quantification of uncertainty in integrated water models is proposed by tscheikner gratl et al 2017 five generic steps have been identified for handling uncertainties in integrated environmental models iems incorporating ecosystem services baustert et al 2018 1 location 2 identification 3 characterization 4 treatment and 5 communication of the uncertainties in a cyclic and iterative process techniques commonly applied in each of these steps are also discussed in the current work the following techniques are suggested to be implemented for the assessment reduction and control of uncertainties li et al 2018 i application of a data model fusion and data assimilation framework to integrate heterogenous data into the required spatial and temporal dynamics and constrain the used water models keenan et al 2011 li et al 2018 liu and gupta 2007 ii application of multi objective and multivariate calibration techniques to reduce the bias of the model rouholahnejad et al 2012 zhang et al 2013 and iii implementation of global sensitivity analysis in which the variation range of all input parameters is considered simultaneously the contribution of input parameters to the total model error is assessed for the entire range space of the input parameter borgonovo and plischke 2016 gan et al 2014 sarrazin et al 2016 it is also suggested to expand the boundaries of the uncertainty assessment beyond the calibration validation and uncertainty assessment phases uncertainties can be located identified and mapped during the model conceptualization stage considering the model goal and scope the model structure and required parameters considering acceptable uncertainty ranges while accounting related risks specific consideration is required for the efficient and standardized communication of the uncertainties to the relevant stakeholders baustert et al 2018 2 6 valorisation of resources and market analysis the principle no 4 of the dublin statement on water and sustainable development international conference on water and the environment organized by the united nations dublin ireland january 1992 highlights that not recognizing the economic value of water generally leads to wasteful and environmentally damaging uses of the resource managing water as an economic good is an important way of achieving efficient and equitable use and of encouraging conservation and protection of water resources therefore value of water and in water is included in the mswca framework revealing and assessing the economic aspects of the ce principles design out waste externalities e g optimization of water resources use through sufficient and correct valuation of water keep resources in use e g optimization of resource yields obtained from water energy nutrients minerals and chemicals and water reuse regenerate natural capital e g correct valuation of natural capital through non market methods such as pollution prevention natural capital restoration etc 2 6 1 value of water in order to adequately value water different types of uses in market and non market sectors must be characterized water as an economic good in market sectors can be considered as an intermediate or a consumption good intermediate goods are employed to make final products e g agriculture industry while consumption goods provide direct human satisfaction e g water used by households in the case of intermediate goods the economic theory of a profit maximizing producer provides the conceptual valuation framework while in the case of consumption goods the theory of the utility maximizing consumer is used young and loomis 2014 spellman 2015 as with any other environmental resource economic value is measured by the aggregation of many users revealed preference or willingness to pay wtp wtp is straightforward elicited in the case of market prices since prices set by market equilibrium show the wtp by the buyer at the margin similarly for non marketed goods the wtp elicitation constitutes the theoretical basis to calculate shadow prices the theoretical foundations of nonmarket economic valuation of environmental resources are well developed freeman 2003 since market valuation varies according to spatial qualitative and temporal attributes non market valuation or shadow pricing of water should follow similar rules economists additionally consider the existence of other non use values such as future option existence and bequest values however the focus of this study is on the economic valuation of use values as an instrument to consider in circularity assessment the conventional demand or marginal benefit function is the concept measured in economic valuation approaches for sectors such as agriculture i e irrigation industry and households or residential use an abstract demand function can be formulated in order to connect water use demanded quantity and price together with other factors influencing demand e g income temperature water services e g provision urban sanitation and treatment are generally provided under monopoly public private or both and prices do not generally change enough to elicit a demand function in this case a great amount of observations on transactions is needed in order to have sufficient variation in price additionally cross sectional data from different water service suppliers in different municipalities or locations may also offer sufficient price variation under this approach parameters of demand functions can be estimated by using statistical inference and econometric techniques an alternative valuation approach for sectors using water as intermediate good or service such as agriculture and industry bases on the residual value if appropriate prices as determined by the market can be assigned to all inputs but one the remainder of total value of product is imputed to the remaining or residual input water non market valuation approaches can be divided into either revealed preference or stated preference approaches which are both used to elicit the value of water in different sectors including the environment and to economically assess environmental positive and negative externalities from economic sectors affecting water resources e g ecosystem degradation water pollution as in the case of market valuation based on eliciting a demand function upon observed behavior these methods also base on observed behavior of water users revealed preference methods rely on observations of actual expenditure choices made by users revealing their preferences and approach market valuation by inferring the net wtp upon observed changes in user s expenditure for different levels of the environmental resource i e quantity quality this approach generally uses travel cost hedonic pricing and choice modelling methods under the assumption of utility maximization users wtp can be inferred upon their revealed preferences in the case of stated preference methods base on the simulation of a hypothetical non existent market in which respondents or users are asked to express wtp for existing or potential environmental features the deployed methods are choice modelling in this case when hypothetical alternatives are ordered by respondents preferences and contingent valuation method cvm cvms are based on a survey to a sample of respondents water users with the aim to elicit how much money respondents will be willing to pay or willing to accept wta to maintain the existence of or to be compensated for the loss of an environmental resource or service stated preferences of the surveyed individuals are thus obtained the proposed mswca framework accounts for different methodologies to assess the value of water since an adequate implementation of the ce principles require the use of both market and non market valuation methods depending on the considered sector and the service externality to be valued specifically market valuation method will be used to estimate demand curves upon available data in the different sectors and nonmarket valuation will be preferably performed based on stated preference methods though depending on the specific case study revealed preference methods could also be adequate it is worth noting that nonmarket valuation faces some potential weaknesses which need to be considered though evidence suggests that stated preference methods are able to provide valid and reliable estimates a carefully designed survey and sampling procedure to gather the required information are of extreme importance hypothetical bias aggregation bias moral satisfaction and scope sensitivity represent some of the main limitations that stated preference methods need to handle kahneman and knetsch 1992 morrison 2000 harrison and rutström 2008 in the case of revealed preference methods though widely accepted by economists as reliable valuation methods observed behaviors do not usually provide all information needed to deliver valid estimates in all cases haab and mcconnel 2002 consequently the use of both methods is usually recommended when sufficient data is available additionally commented limitations are more likely to occur in the case of non use values which are not the focus of the proposed framework 2 6 2 value in water the proposed mswca framework takes also into account the value in water recoverable materials carried by water and recovered energy depend on the water source e g hydrologic system waste water reclaimed water the specific market needs and regulations and production process requirements of the system valorization of these resources is straightforward based on market valuation techniques since market prices exist for all these materials resources extraction and conveyance costs should be valuated the benefits of resources incorporation e g energy from thermal sources nitrogen for agricultural uses can be assessed by life cycle assessment lca approaches through evaluating the environmental positive impacts achieved by using these reclaimed resources compared to alternative sources in all the stages of a product s life additionally using alternative in water resources can provide cost savings in the production process e g energy savings which can be assessed by life cycle cost lcc economic analysis marín 2015 environmental benefits such as reduction elimination of negative environmental externalities related to mineral extraction e g water soil and air pollution achieved savings in energy power from polluting sources avoidance of excess nutrient loads in water bodies etc can be economically valued by non market approaches as described in previous section in this sense lcc helps to identify and assess circularity measures to be implemented in complex water systems although lcc economic analysis is simple to understand and perform and helps to assess circularity and resource efficiency it also has some limitations on one hand it is mainly valid on the micro level e g specific production processes where data scarcity and calculation uncertainty may represent relevant limitations on the other hand lcc is inadequate for assessing environmental impacts mainly due to market and information failures being recommended the use of lca to complement lcc kambanou and sakao 2020 in this regard it is worth noting that though lca might imply higher implementation complexities in terms of inputs and resources needed studies such as walker et al 2018 and potting et al 2017 assert that circularity indexes should be supported by lca approaches the circularity assessment approach proposed in this study takes into account the use of both analytical approaches lca and lcc with the aim to assess the value in water 2 7 measuring and assessing circularity circularity assessment involves a complex multi sectoral systems analysis managing different resources and considering feedback loops and interdependencies such a complicated analysis inevitably produces complicated results which require simplification in order to facilitate communication and comparison the use of indicators is a common practice in complex systems to simplify results visualization lu et al 2019 in the developed indicators database section 4 the selection of appropriate existing and newly developed indicators targets at a holistic evaluation of the three ce principles i e three different sets of indicators one indicator set per principle the indicators are further differentiated in data oriented indicators i e indicators provided by stakeholders information oriented indicators i e calculated indicators from modelling for system s understanding and action oriented indicators i e circularity performance indicators calculated from modelling for circularity assessment thus information overload is avoided but at the same time access to information oriented and data indicators offer the possibility of understanding underlying factors processes or interactions that are linked with circularity 3 the mswca framework in this section the conceptual multi sectoral water circularity assessment mswca framework is presented aiming to bridge gaps and synthesise highlighted aspects mentioned in previous sections the framework fig 3 includes five distinct phases namely system development system synthesis system analysis assessment and system testing the main components of mswca are mfa natural systems models and economic valuation information oriented and action oriented i e circularity performance indicators cpi indicators as well as sensitivity and uncertainty analyses are incorporated into a modelling framework mswca follows a multi sectoral systems approach similar to the one developed by villarroel walker 2010 mswca considers different socio economic i e urban water energy food agriculture industry waste handling and non economic i e natural environment sectors and targets the symbiotic management of resources i e water energy nutrients and other materials as they flow through the different sectors the modelling approach enables the investigation of the feedback loops between the socio economic sectors and the environment as well as of the complex interactions between them therefore synergies and antagonisms among the different sectors are revealed and a balance between socio economic activities and environmental resilience is promoted the mswca is developed in line with the following principles to unlock data trapped in silos and overcome data inefficiencies by developing an indicators database to promote systems approach by assessing multi sectoral systems incorporating various resources making natural capital an integral component of systems circularity to estimate both the value in and of water by considering both market and non market sectors to holistically assess the circularity performance of multi sectoral systems both at systems and sectoral levels considering sensitivity and uncertainty analyses and to evaluate the impact of future interventions to achieve future circularity targets mswca stages include system development this phase involves the selection of the multi sectoral system all the involved socio economic sectors are specified and the system boundaries are expanded to include the physical boundaries of the surrounding natural environment the sectors include all the relevant unit processes process diagrams of the selected socio economic sectors fig 1 and consider the flows of the targeted resources i e water energy nitrogen carbon phosphorus other materials the inclusion or not of other materials resources such as metals minerals cellulose etc depends on the market needs and the additional industrial sector of interest in order to utilize and valorise the specific material the second phase of data acquisition is of major importance as it directly affects the quality accuracy and precision of the results data acquisition enables the calculation of natural and anthropogenic flows of resources therefore general data e g climate geomorphology lulc water energy nutrients other materials uses soil and water quality resource recovery etc are required additionally the state of certain ecological parameters is required to enable correlation between them and natural resource cycles several sources of information may be used to obtain the required data the source of information is related to the uncertainty level of the model and therefore to the sensitivity analysis in order to form a common baseline for data acquisition related to multi sectoral systems an indicators database is developed correlating the required data obtained in terms of required parameters and data oriented indicators to information oriented and action oriented indicators for circularity assessment section 4 system synthesis the first phase of system synthesis involves the geospatial representation of the studied multi sectoral system i e land use land cover of the system including number and type of buildings in their actual location and population the next phase built upon the previous one is the development of the integrated model for the multi sectoral system that includes four modelling components i e the socio economic sectors the non economic sector i e natural environment their nodes of intersection and the system as a whole the socio economic sectors are modelled using mfa based on developed mass balances the resource flows i e water nutrients energy and other materials required to solve the mass balances are calculated based on available data consumption and production patterns mass transfer coefficients and process equations the establishment of resource patterns transfer coefficients for each process and the application of different products lifetime functions enable the establishment of dynamic mfa that would facilitate the integration to the natural system models computational models can be also used to estimate specific resource flows or air emissions in case that higher precision is required the developed resource balances for each of the socio economic sectors result in quantification of inputs and outputs waste including emissions to air water and soil accumulation internal resource reuse recycling and resource materials to be recirculated to another socio economic sector at this stage the information to be transferred from each socio economic sector to the others as well as to the natural environment i e input to the natural system model is specified the different socio economic sectors are interconnected in the model via nodes indicating their physical interactions the nodes can be simulated using linear nonlinear and differential equations thresholds if then rules and demand supply functions integrating market simulation that is based on economic valuation and analysis the nodes also act as modules performing data mediation both semantically and structurally interoperable data flows according to wang and grant 2019 to enable data transfer from one model to the other the complexity of nodes simulation increases significantly if complex agent based models abm are integrated that can be used to simulate diffusion of innovation and adoption changes in policies individual behaviour etc the non economic sector i e the natural environment is modelled using natural system models and input data resulted from the human system models e g water withdrawals irrigation water nutrients inputs emissions etc and entering the natural system models via the feedback loop nodes static data e g soil and management conditions soil type and formations hydraulic conditions etc as well as dynamic data e g weather conditions obtained through data acquisition procedure are also used as model inputs hydro biogeochemical modelling enabling an integrated investigation of water carbon nutrient and sediment dynamics is suggested to simultaneously simulate the water and nutrients transport fate and cycling mass transfer is at the core of such models using a series of differential constitutive equations based on various processes e g diffusion reaction etc and their corresponding coefficients e g diffusion or mass transfer coefficients forces and fluxes are computed to solve field balance equations additionally ecological parameters such as biodiversity soil erosion etc are included in the model in the form of indicators as their relationship with the water and nutrients cycles is not straightforward statistical approaches can be used to investigate correlations the modelling output is mainly the quantification and qualification of different resources flows that re enter via the feedback loops nodes or affect the socio economic sectors integrated modelling is interacting via the nodes with market analysis and economic valuation for the non economic sector of natural environment non market valuation approaches i e revealed preference and stated preference methods are deployed for the economic valuation of water resource for the socio economic sectors the economic valuation targets water as an intermediate good water as a consumption good and indirect resources recovered from water using market valuation techniques for the recovered resources lca and lcc physical chemical and mechanical properties and regulatory standards are included in the analysis therefore this phase focuses on the elicitation of the value of water and of recovered resources in the different sectors and on the investigation of positive and negative externalities occurred from the socio economic sectors affecting the natural capital at this stage the multi sectoral system s model is solved and calibrated see the following section of system testing for the year of data acquisition and the identified indicators are calculated system analysis the results of the integrated model are interpreted graphical representations flow diagrams table matrices etc are created enabling the multi sectoral analysis of the system in terms of holistic performance synergies antagonisms feedback loops and identification of hotspots the system analysis phase is completed with the circularity assessment based on specific circularity metrics i e circularity performance indicators cpis the cpis consist of a set of whole of system and sector specific indicators and are categorized based on the ce principle that they target holistically assessing circularity of multi sectoral systems incorporating various resources system testing activities to identify characterize treat and communicate the uncertainties of the mswca are dynamic and run in parallel to all mswca stages from the selection of the multi sectoral system and conceptualization of the modelling study to the model integration and evaluation of the assessment outputs in the initial phases of the system development uncertainty sources are mapped qualitatively or quantitatively and prioritised acceptable levels of uncertainty are also defined in this phase this can help evaluate the system boundaries selected the completeness of sectors and flows considered in the assessment and guide the data collection i e identify data that will impact significantly the assessment output focus effort to improve their quality and model section processes i e identify the requirements and the temporal and spatial resolution of the models the uncertainties map can be updated during model development the integration of data and models used in the assessment is an important step in the analysis and needs to follow a systematic data assimilation framework to combine the heterogenous streams of data with the models accounting for the related uncertainties in a transparent and statistically robust way during the integrated modelling phase special attention is required to the calibration techniques followed the parameters of the model need to be selected to maximize the fit of the model with the data it is suggested either to calibrate the integrated model simultaneously can be computationally expensive or to calibrate the upstream model e g the natural system model and gradually integrate and calibrate the downstream modules e g the human system model etc to investigate how the variability of input conditions and how uncertainties of the inputs and models are translated into uncertainties of the integrated model outputs uncertainty and global sensitivity analyses are performed the sensitivity analysis indicates important parameters that significantly affect the reliability of the assessment results uncertainty analysis is used to obtain probability distributions the integrated model outputs and indicators based on the probability distributions of the input data the uncertainty of the model s output due to the uncertainty in the model s parameters and other input data is calculated using a set of uncertainty levels based on the quality range and the applicability of different sources of information finally clear communication of the uncertainties and reliability of the assessment results in a qualitative and quantitative way is vital to create trust in the assessment results and support decision making of the pathways to achieve the predefined circularity targets the final phase of mswca is the assessment by investigating the attainability of specific circularity targets in terms of cpis the goal of this phase is twofold to assess the circularity performance of the current system and to predict by understanding potential future behaviour of the system based on today s decisions i e the model is run again to predict future system trajectories and assess the ability of the system to reach the circularity targets in case that the system does not reach the quantifiable circularity targets strategic alternative scenarios can be tested 4 circularity performance indicators cpi the developed excel tool supplementary materials includes an indicators database for holistic circularity assessment of multi sectoral systems enabling information sharing for integrated management of resources it includes requirements on data that should be measured and collected for the quantification of the cpis the tool differentiates between required parameters and three types of indicators i e data oriented information oriented and action oriented i e cpis indicators parameters i e data requirements and data oriented indicators i e doi are based on information coming from different stakeholders and sources allowing the integrated modelling of the system parameter is defined as a factor that can be measured or observed doi are indicators that can provide information on matters of wider significance or make perceptible a trend or phenomenon that is not immediately detectable hammond et al 1995 the doi can be provided by stakeholders for example water demand use by sector is defined as a state indicator e g by unido and by european environment agency for recognising potential water conflicts an estimation of water demand can be provided by relevant stakeholders e g municipalities another example is the water supply service coverage or proportion of population served by the water supply industry that is defined by unsd 2008 as an indicator for water accessibility and its estimation can be provided relevant stakeholders as well information oriented indicators i e ioi consist of a long list of indicators that are resulted from modelling calculations based on parameters and doi during the implementation of the framework and they are not directly used in but rather support the assessment the assessment is based on action oriented indicators i e aoi named here as cpis aoi or cpis are derived from the integrated modelling and are calculated from further processing of ioi doi and parameters cpis are used for communication of the results and consist of a short list of indicators targeted at the three ce principles to reduce the number of indicators used for circularity assessment the ioi are indicators measuring circularity aspects indirectly and therefore are used to explain the outcomes of the assessment the ioi are not used for communicating the results of the assessment but they are accessible to the interested parties for informative purposes the tool includes existing and newly developed indicators the indicators tool is tailored to the multi sectoral system approach by differentiating between whole of a system and sector specific indicators i e indicators related to the system as a whole and to the urban water agro food energy industrial waste handling sectors and natural capital the tool also provides information about the units methodological aspects i e methodology equation or reference in order to calculate the indicator typology differentiating between descriptive efficiency and performance indicators level of measurement i e a 1st level indicator is a value derived from parameters a 2nd level indicator is derived from further processing a 1st level indicator into an equation or model and so on description and goal of the indicator the indicators are further categorized based on the type of information they provide i e generic economic information related to water nutrients substances energy biodiversity and information related to the ce principles regenerate natural capital and design out waste externalities principles contain consequential cpis while keep resources in use principle is measured with intrinsic cpis 5 conceptual example a circular city the mswca framework is applied in a conceptual example of a small city the imaginary city s electricity source is from renewables i e solar and wind energy the urban water sector consists of centralized water supply to meet the drinking water demands of the area using a surface natural resource centralised wastewater treatment receives only blackwater while greywater from the sinks and taps is treated separately decentralised greywater treatment and in combination with rainwater harvesting is used to meet the domestic demands i e toilet flushing washing machines and irrigation of gardens the centralised wastewater treatment is performed in one treatment plant and the treated effluent after disinfection is sent to a set of natural and humanmade wetlands the wetland system supplies the local agricultural water requirements the agro food sector consists of agriculture both livestock and crops and the agricultural production is sold in local markets the waste handling sector receives the produced sludge which is composted and used as soil amendment while livestock manure food and green waste are composted and sent back to agriculture for fertilization purposes all other types of waste are disregarded in this example the required information is collected in the form of parameters and data oriented indicators via the proposed indicator tool the configuration of the multi sectoral system is illustrated in fig 4 the next step of the framework includes the development of the integrated model parameters and data oriented indicators are used as inputs to the model for each one of the socio economic and non economic sectors mass balances are developed and model inputs are used to calculate all the required resource flows and to solve the developed mass balances for all the incorporated resources for the urban water sector daily water rates for water treatment use greywater and blackwater production treatment recycling and discharge are used in combination with precipitation data and catchment area for rainwater harvesting water resources permanent and seasonal population centralized and decentralized water users to calculate all the daily water flows in terms of inputs from the natural environment i e water withdrawals from the natural resource harvested rainwater internal recirculation for domestic water requirements storage in case of excess water and outputs to the natural environment discharge to the wetlands leakages and irrigation of gardens the nutrient flows of the urban water sector are calculated based on data from nutrient concentrations in raw water blackwater and greywater on the incorporated water volumes and treatment rates the calculations result in daily nutrient inputs from the natural environment and the agro food sector internal recirculation i e nutrients incorporated in the recirculation of domestic water storage and outputs to the environment in terms of emissions and discharge or disposal and to waste handling sector nutrients in sludge water flows are also accompanied with other critical substances e g chemicals used for treatment pathogens and other pollutants and their flows are also calculated based on their concentrations in water waste or usage rates the energy consumption in centralized and decentralized water and wastewater treatment are also calculated for the agro food sector nutrient and water flows incorporated in the local agricultural production are calculated based on hydro biogeochemical modelling using soil condition soil type and formations hydraulic conditions management practices weather data fertilizer inputs etc the quantification of water e g infiltration evapotranspiration irrigation runoff etc and nutrient e g nutrient surplus nutrient in crops nutrient in residuals gaseous emissions etc flows are the modelling outputs the local market receives locally produced food yields and imported food the green and food waste resulted in the agro food sector as well as the nutrient content in the waste are also calculated the energy consumption is calculated as well for the waste handling sector daily inputs of sludge and manure green and food waste received as well as their nutrient content are calculated the outputs include daily amount of produced compost to be recirculated to the agricultural sector and to the natural environment nutrients amounts in the produced compost and nutrient outputs diluted in produced wastewater in case of dewatering and fate nutrient emissions nutrient leakages nutrients in residual waste from screening and fate water vapour etc energy requirements are calculated as well hydro biogeochemical modelling is deployed to reveal the state of the natural environment in terms of nutrients and water cycles soil condition and biodiversity as well the quantification of water e g infiltration evapotranspiration water withdrawals runoff etc and nutrient e g nutrient surplus nutrient in crops nutrient in residuals gaseous emissions etc flows are the modelling outputs as well as the state of soil and biodiversity condition quality and quantity of water bodies and air quality or emissions all the quantified final outputs of the human system model serve as inputs to the natural system model while the calculated natural capital flows leaving the natural environment re enter the human system model the economic simulation is based on economic valuation of market and non market services and is run in tandem revealing economic changes in values either positive or negative due to the behaviour of the physical multi sectoral system the final step is the integration of all the different models by using developed equations functions and rules that describe the feedback loop and socio economic nodes these nodes determine the amount and frequency of the resource flows entering and leaving each modelling component the integrated system model is run solving the whole of a system daily seasonal and annual mass balances and revealing potential changes to the natural capital due to fast processes this is the completion of the first simulation loop sensitivity and uncertainty analyses are performed to investigate the uncertainty of the modelling outcomes and communicated to the relevant parties after ensuring the computability of the integrated model the information oriented indicators that were not used to solve the mass balances and the action oriented indicators are calculated in this conceptual example some of the ioi that are used to solve the water balances in the integrated modelling procedure include rainfall volume infiltration evapotranspiration runoff change in soil moisture water demand per sector actual irrigation water demand and others however the ioi of irrigation efficiency is not required to solve the water balances but it is further calculated as a ratio of water supplied for irrigation per actual irrigation demand to evaluate if the agricultural system is overwatered underwatered or sufficiently irrigated similarly the aoi of regenerative capacity index for water requires further calculation the total quantitative and qualitative water withdrawals of the system are compared to the natural water recharge volume of water of improved quality that is stored to the water bodies due to natural hydrological water cycle taking also into consideration the volume of water of the same quality that is returned to the water bodies from the anthropogenic water system after having calculated all the ioi and aoi cpis the results are presented and assessed the first step of the assessment is the presentation analysis and evaluation of the cpis the analysis reveals the extent of achieved intrinsic circularity of the different resources the consequent environmental and economic effects the synergies and antagonisms between the different sectors in terms of resources consumption and circularity and the identification of hotspots both current and future after the identification of system s hotspots the relevant information based indicators i e the ones connected to the cpis are analysed to understand the reason of system s failure and what actions are required to improve circularity the reasons might be technical physical economic social regulatory or policy and they should be communicated to the relevant parties to take appropriate actions for example if one of the identified hotspots is the gross p balance io indicators related to p cycling are analysed to understand if the reason is overfertilization low retention capacity of soil overwatering etc or if water stress is severe io indicators of environmental water use environmental water requirements water provisioning capacity alternative water use internal and intersectoral water recycling water intensity water demand requiring drinking water standards etc are further analysed to understand the reason of failure the analysis is performed internally and only the most probable reasons of failure are presented to the relevant stakeholders 6 conclusions to address water circularity fundamental changes are needed in the way water is managed and valued and in the way data is shared among practitioners policies regulations and assessment frameworks the proposed mswca framework approaches circularity from a multi sectoral perspective following a systems approach that symbiotically manages key water related socio economic and non economic sectors a visualization of the mswca s application to a fictional city is presented to enable the understanding of the framework and its practical use whilst developing the mswca framework we identified a number of hurdles the consistency and valid flow of input information is one of the identified hurdles to overcome this problem we suggest the indicators tool the tool establishes a common baseline for data requirements and indicators to be used for the assessment the next identified issue is the economic valuation of nonmarket goods to overcome this issue the mswca framework suggests the use of both revealed and stated preference methods the third issue relates to feedback loops and interdependencies between different sectors and the natural environment this framework offers a novel methodology to link natural environment to human system models integration also entails seamless data exchange between different system components making data interoperability a necessity the mswca framework provides the environment for the interaction of data from multiple sources thus facilitating integrated modelling integration increased data volume and modelling complexities creates uncertainties the proposed framework also suggests qualitative and quantitative

17485,water the most vital resource negatively affected by the linear pattern of growth still tries to find its positioning within the emerging concept of circular economy fragmented sectorial circularity approaches hide the risk of underestimating both the preservation of and impacts to water resources and natural capital in this study a game changing circularity assessment framework is developed i e mswca the mswca follows a multi sectoral systems approach symbiotically managing key water related socio economic i e urban water agro food energy industry and waste handling and non economic i e natural environment sectors the mswca modelling framework enables the investigation of the feedback loops between the nature managed and human managed systems to assess water and water related resources circularity the three ce principles lie at the core of the developed framework enabling the consideration of physical technical environmental and economic aspects an indicators database is further developed including all the relevant data requirements as well as existing and newly developed indicators assessing multi sectoral systems circularity the mswca framework is conceptually applied to a fictional city facilitating its understanding and practical use graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords circularity assessment framework water system ecosystem services human and nature managed systems circularity performance indicators 1 introduction water in the environment follows a natural circular model that secures water resources by regulating water flow and ensuring water quality however in human managed systems that follow a linear model of economic growth water is successively qualitatively degraded after use becoming unfit for further use both by humans and ecosystems stuchtey 2015 to decouple economic growth and development from imprudent resource consumption the alternative model of circular economy ce is been promoted aiming to achieve resource efficiency to reduce waste production and to improve environmental economic and social sustainability european commission 2015 to stimulate ce uptake water phosphorous and metals have been identified by hislop and hill 2011 as key priority resources beyond its necessary preservation water is a carrier of energy and materials the most obvious connection between water and ce is seen in the transition of wastewater treatment plants to resource recovery facilities motivating the recovery and valorization of treated wastewater materials e g nutrients organic matter etc and energy efficiency zhijun and nailing 2007 sgroi et al 2018 voulvoulis et al 2018 other non conventional approaches that could enhance resources circularity are the use of alternative water sources e g rainwater and stormwater harvesting etc the decentralized sanitation and reuse model and the ecological sanitation model abu ghunmi et al 2016 however fragmented management and implementation of such models is unlikely to result to desired outcomes from a ce perspective a more holistic water circularity approach is proposed by five corporate bodies i e mckinsey company international water association arup antea group and ellen macarthur foundation in three white papers i e stuchtey 2015 iwa 2016 arup et al 2018 the authors have identified the need for an integrated water management approach from local to river basin encompassing different sectors i e systems approach differentiating between water functionalities i e resource consumable durable to enable reuse and recycling symbiotically managing resources i e water materials and energy and considering the multiple interactions between nature managed and human managed systems three ce principles were developed and adapted to sustainable water management i e regenerate natural capital keep resources in use and designing out waste externalities in an effort to create a common basis for the development of a ce framework for water arup et al 2018 the regenerate natural capital principle aims to ensure functional environmental flows and stocks the keep resources in use principle focuses on closing the resource loops and the design out waste externalities principle targets at the economically efficient reduction of waste nika et al 2020 however such an integrated approach would require to overcome existing barriers integrated water management requires application of integrated models enabling systematic analyses to investigate interconnections synergies and antagonisms between the different sectors and resources villarroel walker and beck 2012 as well as the feedback loops between the technosphere and the biosphere integrated management and modelling further indicate the need for data sharing availability and security ludwig et al 2014 moreover successful implementation of ce in water requires innovations promoted through a social and institutional context as well as the establishment of appropriate regulations and standards heshmati 2015 although in many cases innovative technologies are already available e g resource recovery from wastewater hindered ce implementation is attributed to the lack of planning and design methodology capable to identify the most appropriate solutions tailored to individual cases van der hoek et al 2016 difficulties have been also identified in valuing environmental benefits against economic costs as well as the relationship between environmental practices and corporate competitiveness and profits in an effort to find the right incentives for companies to implement ce sartal et al 2020 the latter becomes more challenging for water valuation as current water pricing policies do not account for external costs i e externalities related to economic social and environmental aspects greyson 2007 hislop and hill 2011 in this study a comprehensive analysis of water within the concept of ce is being conducted in an effort to address current challenges through the development of a game changing circularity assessment framework the proposed multi sectoral water circularity assessment mswca framework follows a multi sectoral approach focusing on both economic and non economic i e ecosystems sectors and symbiotically managing multiple resources it reveals the complex interconnections and interdependencies between the different sectors in this work the term sector is used to group the resource oriented activities of an area that support the economy and have a direct or indirect impact to water resources the mswca applies integration of models and approaches for circularity assessment in line with the three ce principles covering physical technical environmental and economic aspects an indicator database has been developed as part of the framework allowing data circulation and enabling comparability of different systems a qualitative showcase of the mswca framework in a fictional case study is also presented in this work allowing a better understanding of its implementation and use 2 water circularity 2 1 water in the centre of ce naturally the hydrological cycle is influenced by weather climate and physical characteristics of the area i e land and soil formations vegetation and geology meaning that land use land cover lulc and climate changes significantly impact the hydrological cycle ma et al 2008 a disrupted hydrological cycle directly affects ecosystems species and therefore biodiversity which in turn is critical to water and nutrients cycling lange et al 2019 hydrological cycle alterations are further induced by water withdrawals resulted from the various socio economic activities e g agriculture accounts for 69 of the global water withdrawals industries for 19 and municipalities for 12 fao 2016 additionally water with degraded quality that is returned to the basin i e qualitative withdrawals may result in substantial chemical and biological consequences to human health ecosystems and biodiversity davis et al 2016 but also to amenity and economic activity fig 1 illustrates the interdependencies between the different socio economic and non economic i e natural environment sectors the feedback loops occurring in the naturally interconnected system show that any change has an inevitable effect to all the different components of the system i e the ripple effect everard 2004 thus water is the ultimate systems challenge although this ripple effect is increasingly acknowledged in various cases water management is still fragmented everard et al 2016 socio economic sectors are artificially divided with water being managed at sectoral level and seldom at river basin level and considered as an isolated component of the ecosystem an example of the ripple effect caused by sectoral management can be seen in china s policy to address food security by achieving self sufficiency of 95 that resulted in irreversible depletion of water resources and in increased stresses to ecosystems and biodiversity ghose 2014 the transition to a holistic and integrated water management at river basin scale was the rational of the european water framework directive 2000 60 ec wfd which in spite its initial recognition as a ground breaking environmental directive failed to achieve the initial targets the failure is attributed to the lack of efforts towards the implementation of the systemic approach mandated by the directive voulvoulis et al 2017 the systemic approach appears as a prerequisite for ce emf 2013 raising concerns of amplified risks and not reaching the expected results to water resources ecosystems and biodiversity in case that efforts are concentrated in sectoral rather than integrated management in this context the development of a holistic circularity assessment framework is required that would enable and support a strategic circular water management approach the mswca framework is encompassing both socio economic i e water energy agro food other related industry and waste handling and non economic i e ecosystems sectors to overcome the issue of fragmented water management 2 2 circularity prerequisites the effective implementation of circularity involves the identification of clear circularity pathways e g water circularity focuses on using the right water from multiple water sources i e surface and groundwater desalinated water industrial brine and wastewater rainwater and stormwater greywater and blackwater for the right purpose to the right users in a synergetic combination of centralised and decentralised water systems such approach implies the application of different water functionalities stuchtey 2015 that enable a targeted and effective multi sourcing recycling and reuse of water however in many cases the circular models do not fit as the arisen challenges are not technical but rather policy related leading to difficulties to make a step change therefore the actual implementation of water functionalities requires the establishment of water quality standards and appropriate policies and regulations at both the centralized and decentralized levels supporting the concept of water circularity circularity performance assessment additionally requires the specification of clear circularity targets presented as ce principles by arup et al 2018 i e regeneration of natural capital keep resources in use and design out waste externalities the ce principles indicate the consideration of environmental technical physical and economic aspects in the assessment as well as the symbiotic management of water related materials and energy the world forum on natural capital defines natural capital as the world s stocks of natural assets which include geology soil air water and all living things the natural capital principle aims to ensure functional environmental flows and stocks keep resources in use ce principle targets the reduction of extraction abstraction of natural resources and minimization of waste generation by closing the water water related materials and energy loops within the system the design out waste externalities principle targets the reduction of negative externalities by turning them into positive outcomes externalities can be both positive e g monetary value attributed to clean water biodiversity etc or negative e g monetary value attributed to pollution and result from producing or consuming a good or service any kind of waste and or emissions solid liquid gaseous potentially causes environmental impacts translated to negative externalities thus waste reduction and reuse result in reduction of negative externalities and in potential increase of positive externalities the mswca framework enables the incorporation of the three principles to holistically assess the target system 2 3 symbiotic management of resources and dynamic interactions water feedback loops and the associated ripple effect require the implementation of systems approach by using multi sectoral analysis however water can be seen not only as a resource but also as a carrier both in the human managed and nature managed systems e g nutrients are diluted in water thus their transport fate and natural cycling is controlled to a high extent by water while in the human managed systems various substances including nutrients minerals metals and other are concentrated in used water which can be seen either as a cause of pollution or as an opportunity for resource other than water recovery valorisation and reuse energy embodied in water can also be recovered and used holistic multi sectoral assessment implies the simultaneous investigation and management of multiple resources i e water energy nutrients and other materials as they flow through the different socio economic and non economic sectors however symbiotic management of resources at multi sectoral systems increases the complexity of managing supply and demand due to numerous supply and value chains more complicated and dynamic interactions and incorporated processes between them and various environmental economic social and regulative aspects to adequately describe the behaviour of the system and enable the circularity assessment covering all different aspects integration of methods models and metrics is required nika et al 2020 the intrinsic purpose of circularity is to reduce the amount of resources used by increasing their recirculation and reuse i e closing the resources loops which indicates the need for quantification saidani et al 2019 therefore material flow analysis mfa and substance flow analysis sfa are widely used to assess circularity pauliuk 2018 moraga et al 2019 they systematically quantify the flows and stocks of materials in systems differentiating between flows of goods e g drinking water and flows of substances contained within these goods e g nitrogen pivnenko et al 2016 on the other hand the effects resulted by closing the resources loops i e consequential circularity need to be investigated as well which has led to an increased use of lca based methods to assess this aspect saidani et al 2019 while mfa can be applied at different levels of sophistication enabling its use in complex systems lca generally neglects the feedback loops between the anthroposphere and the biosphere weidema et al 2018 hindering its use in complex systems where interactions between socio economic and ecological systems are of major importance feedback loops are observed at different time scales resulting from fast i e occurring over days and years and slow i e occurring over decades and centuries processes ward et al 2019 a fast process is water withdrawal or crop yield while a slow process is change in biodiversity consequential circularity is therefore suggested to be assessed by coupling natural and human system models in an effort to investigate and predict complex system behaviour emerging from non linearities time lags and unexpected results caused by feedback loops natural system models are referred here as numerical models to simulate the natural system s behaviour and dynamics nika et al 2020 presented a variety of hydrologic and biogeochemical models to simulate water and nutrients or solutes transport fate and cycling other types of natural system models including ecological models such as modelling of biodiversity change or water quality models etc also exist and may be required to be coupled on the other hand human system models vary from analytical tools such as mfa and lca and more complex agent based models to capture human system s dynamics by incorporating market processes human decision making and behaviour integrated modelling or nexus approaches to deal with interdisciplinary issues emerging from ce and water related concepts e g sponge city or even from water management are increasingly acknowledged in the recent literature for example available tools investigating interlinkages between different sectors are suggested to be used as city circularity tools in the review paper of paiho et al 2020 however the reviewed tools mainly focus on the socio economic sectors while natural environment is underestimated by not being an integral part of the analysis on the other hand nguyen et al 2020 incorporate ecosystem services in the developed integrated assessment framework but as the focus is on sponge cities it lacks models or approaches targeted at assessing circularity in human managed systems li et al 2018 developed a watershed modelling framework to represent the coevolution of the water land air plant human nexus in a watershed but the investigation of circularity is again out of the scope of this study working towards the direction of integrated approaches the mswca framework allows the assessment of multi sectoral systems characterized by interdependencies and feedback loops it suggests the integration of mfa lca and economic models for the socio economic sectors i e human system and hydro biogeochemical model s and ecological indicators modelling for the natural biophysical system to investigate the natural system s dynamics and behaviour within a single modelling framework however the purpose of the developed framework is not to specify the exact models both the number and the modelling software to be used but rather to recommend concepts and modelling approaches that are required for a multi sectoral systems assessment there is not a unique combination of models and tools as the most appropriate natural and human system models are case specific for example if natural ecosystems such as forest form a major component of the studied system then biogeochemical models considering macropore flow of phosphorus may be more appropriate compared to the studied system in which agriculture plays a major role with conventionally tilled soils where macropore flow is less pronounced pferdmenges et al 2020 additionally the number of the models and tools to be coupled should be decided with cautious the higher the number of coupled models and tools the higher the complexity of the integrated model is impeding its application therefore the mswca framework considers the interconnections between the different sectors in terms of water energy nutrients and other substances materials flows and enables the incorporation of feedback loops in terms of physical responses and not human behaviour between the different socio economic sectors and between the anthroposphere and biosphere as well more complex agent based modelling that investigates the human system s dynamics can be coupled to the integrated model at a later stage if necessary 2 4 common baseline for data requirements the effectiveness of integrated water management depends on accurate information resulted from a holistic assessment while the effectiveness of the assessment framework depends on securing access to accurate data from different sources fig 2 collection standardization homogenization and exploitation of the multiple heterogeneous and fragmented data sources that are required for a holistic multisector circularity assessment is not trivial historical data are conventionally collected for different purposes from diverse disciplines following various methodologies and structure resulting in inconsistent forms resolution and terminology water data are currently trapped in silos rising issues of data accessibility ownership trust interorganizational competition security and privacy for data sharing among the interested parties in many cases there is also a lack of consensus on relevant data needed to feed the frameworks resulting from different philosophies in data importance regarding environmental data related to nature managed systems there is a two tier data regime there are fields with very good protocols and metadata e g weather and climate whereas there are fields that are underdeveloped in terms of data requirements and reporting e g nutrients cycling ecosystem services etc therefore decision makers are often hindered to compare management options make informed decisions balancing economic social and environmental interests and subsequently evaluate and prioritize potential solutions to overcome this bottleneck common data policies data management infrastructures and shared data systems are required between public and private decision makers stakeholders and practitioners therefore an indicators database including every data instance required for a holistic approach is developed within the mswca framework 2 5 data gathering and models uncertainty there are several levels of uncertainty associated with the modelling process from the input data i e quality reliability data processing protocols to the model or sub models structure i e conceptualization inaccuracies omission of significant mechanisms ill defined boundary conditions and the linkage between different water subsystems or between human sectors and the natural environment i e gaps in knowledge on the interactions between human natural systems and their boundaries issues with the integration of fast and slow process dynamics between natural and human systems the robust quantification of uncertainties and risks of the model outputs increases the predictability and practicability of the model and helps decision makers to develop an understanding of the reliability and impact of the uncertainties on the model estimations the complexity of an integrated circular water management assessment model increases with the increase of sectors and components i e agro food energy waste natural capital mapping of the uncertainty sources their magnitude and their relationships is a significant step in the analysis uusitalo et al 2015 the holistic model should consider uncertainties from the different water sub systems modeled and uncertainties due to the coupling of the sub systems tscheikner gratl et al 2019 however there are differences in the perception of uncertainties across the environmental modelling and integrated water modelling community and across the different water sectors and a standardized methodological approach to identify quantify reduce report and communicate uncertainties is still missing bach et al 2014 montanari 2007 vanrolleghem et al 2011 an overview on uncertainty sources for the integrated water modelling can be found in the study of tscheikner gratl et al 2019 whereas a practical approach for the quantification of uncertainty in integrated water models is proposed by tscheikner gratl et al 2017 five generic steps have been identified for handling uncertainties in integrated environmental models iems incorporating ecosystem services baustert et al 2018 1 location 2 identification 3 characterization 4 treatment and 5 communication of the uncertainties in a cyclic and iterative process techniques commonly applied in each of these steps are also discussed in the current work the following techniques are suggested to be implemented for the assessment reduction and control of uncertainties li et al 2018 i application of a data model fusion and data assimilation framework to integrate heterogenous data into the required spatial and temporal dynamics and constrain the used water models keenan et al 2011 li et al 2018 liu and gupta 2007 ii application of multi objective and multivariate calibration techniques to reduce the bias of the model rouholahnejad et al 2012 zhang et al 2013 and iii implementation of global sensitivity analysis in which the variation range of all input parameters is considered simultaneously the contribution of input parameters to the total model error is assessed for the entire range space of the input parameter borgonovo and plischke 2016 gan et al 2014 sarrazin et al 2016 it is also suggested to expand the boundaries of the uncertainty assessment beyond the calibration validation and uncertainty assessment phases uncertainties can be located identified and mapped during the model conceptualization stage considering the model goal and scope the model structure and required parameters considering acceptable uncertainty ranges while accounting related risks specific consideration is required for the efficient and standardized communication of the uncertainties to the relevant stakeholders baustert et al 2018 2 6 valorisation of resources and market analysis the principle no 4 of the dublin statement on water and sustainable development international conference on water and the environment organized by the united nations dublin ireland january 1992 highlights that not recognizing the economic value of water generally leads to wasteful and environmentally damaging uses of the resource managing water as an economic good is an important way of achieving efficient and equitable use and of encouraging conservation and protection of water resources therefore value of water and in water is included in the mswca framework revealing and assessing the economic aspects of the ce principles design out waste externalities e g optimization of water resources use through sufficient and correct valuation of water keep resources in use e g optimization of resource yields obtained from water energy nutrients minerals and chemicals and water reuse regenerate natural capital e g correct valuation of natural capital through non market methods such as pollution prevention natural capital restoration etc 2 6 1 value of water in order to adequately value water different types of uses in market and non market sectors must be characterized water as an economic good in market sectors can be considered as an intermediate or a consumption good intermediate goods are employed to make final products e g agriculture industry while consumption goods provide direct human satisfaction e g water used by households in the case of intermediate goods the economic theory of a profit maximizing producer provides the conceptual valuation framework while in the case of consumption goods the theory of the utility maximizing consumer is used young and loomis 2014 spellman 2015 as with any other environmental resource economic value is measured by the aggregation of many users revealed preference or willingness to pay wtp wtp is straightforward elicited in the case of market prices since prices set by market equilibrium show the wtp by the buyer at the margin similarly for non marketed goods the wtp elicitation constitutes the theoretical basis to calculate shadow prices the theoretical foundations of nonmarket economic valuation of environmental resources are well developed freeman 2003 since market valuation varies according to spatial qualitative and temporal attributes non market valuation or shadow pricing of water should follow similar rules economists additionally consider the existence of other non use values such as future option existence and bequest values however the focus of this study is on the economic valuation of use values as an instrument to consider in circularity assessment the conventional demand or marginal benefit function is the concept measured in economic valuation approaches for sectors such as agriculture i e irrigation industry and households or residential use an abstract demand function can be formulated in order to connect water use demanded quantity and price together with other factors influencing demand e g income temperature water services e g provision urban sanitation and treatment are generally provided under monopoly public private or both and prices do not generally change enough to elicit a demand function in this case a great amount of observations on transactions is needed in order to have sufficient variation in price additionally cross sectional data from different water service suppliers in different municipalities or locations may also offer sufficient price variation under this approach parameters of demand functions can be estimated by using statistical inference and econometric techniques an alternative valuation approach for sectors using water as intermediate good or service such as agriculture and industry bases on the residual value if appropriate prices as determined by the market can be assigned to all inputs but one the remainder of total value of product is imputed to the remaining or residual input water non market valuation approaches can be divided into either revealed preference or stated preference approaches which are both used to elicit the value of water in different sectors including the environment and to economically assess environmental positive and negative externalities from economic sectors affecting water resources e g ecosystem degradation water pollution as in the case of market valuation based on eliciting a demand function upon observed behavior these methods also base on observed behavior of water users revealed preference methods rely on observations of actual expenditure choices made by users revealing their preferences and approach market valuation by inferring the net wtp upon observed changes in user s expenditure for different levels of the environmental resource i e quantity quality this approach generally uses travel cost hedonic pricing and choice modelling methods under the assumption of utility maximization users wtp can be inferred upon their revealed preferences in the case of stated preference methods base on the simulation of a hypothetical non existent market in which respondents or users are asked to express wtp for existing or potential environmental features the deployed methods are choice modelling in this case when hypothetical alternatives are ordered by respondents preferences and contingent valuation method cvm cvms are based on a survey to a sample of respondents water users with the aim to elicit how much money respondents will be willing to pay or willing to accept wta to maintain the existence of or to be compensated for the loss of an environmental resource or service stated preferences of the surveyed individuals are thus obtained the proposed mswca framework accounts for different methodologies to assess the value of water since an adequate implementation of the ce principles require the use of both market and non market valuation methods depending on the considered sector and the service externality to be valued specifically market valuation method will be used to estimate demand curves upon available data in the different sectors and nonmarket valuation will be preferably performed based on stated preference methods though depending on the specific case study revealed preference methods could also be adequate it is worth noting that nonmarket valuation faces some potential weaknesses which need to be considered though evidence suggests that stated preference methods are able to provide valid and reliable estimates a carefully designed survey and sampling procedure to gather the required information are of extreme importance hypothetical bias aggregation bias moral satisfaction and scope sensitivity represent some of the main limitations that stated preference methods need to handle kahneman and knetsch 1992 morrison 2000 harrison and rutström 2008 in the case of revealed preference methods though widely accepted by economists as reliable valuation methods observed behaviors do not usually provide all information needed to deliver valid estimates in all cases haab and mcconnel 2002 consequently the use of both methods is usually recommended when sufficient data is available additionally commented limitations are more likely to occur in the case of non use values which are not the focus of the proposed framework 2 6 2 value in water the proposed mswca framework takes also into account the value in water recoverable materials carried by water and recovered energy depend on the water source e g hydrologic system waste water reclaimed water the specific market needs and regulations and production process requirements of the system valorization of these resources is straightforward based on market valuation techniques since market prices exist for all these materials resources extraction and conveyance costs should be valuated the benefits of resources incorporation e g energy from thermal sources nitrogen for agricultural uses can be assessed by life cycle assessment lca approaches through evaluating the environmental positive impacts achieved by using these reclaimed resources compared to alternative sources in all the stages of a product s life additionally using alternative in water resources can provide cost savings in the production process e g energy savings which can be assessed by life cycle cost lcc economic analysis marín 2015 environmental benefits such as reduction elimination of negative environmental externalities related to mineral extraction e g water soil and air pollution achieved savings in energy power from polluting sources avoidance of excess nutrient loads in water bodies etc can be economically valued by non market approaches as described in previous section in this sense lcc helps to identify and assess circularity measures to be implemented in complex water systems although lcc economic analysis is simple to understand and perform and helps to assess circularity and resource efficiency it also has some limitations on one hand it is mainly valid on the micro level e g specific production processes where data scarcity and calculation uncertainty may represent relevant limitations on the other hand lcc is inadequate for assessing environmental impacts mainly due to market and information failures being recommended the use of lca to complement lcc kambanou and sakao 2020 in this regard it is worth noting that though lca might imply higher implementation complexities in terms of inputs and resources needed studies such as walker et al 2018 and potting et al 2017 assert that circularity indexes should be supported by lca approaches the circularity assessment approach proposed in this study takes into account the use of both analytical approaches lca and lcc with the aim to assess the value in water 2 7 measuring and assessing circularity circularity assessment involves a complex multi sectoral systems analysis managing different resources and considering feedback loops and interdependencies such a complicated analysis inevitably produces complicated results which require simplification in order to facilitate communication and comparison the use of indicators is a common practice in complex systems to simplify results visualization lu et al 2019 in the developed indicators database section 4 the selection of appropriate existing and newly developed indicators targets at a holistic evaluation of the three ce principles i e three different sets of indicators one indicator set per principle the indicators are further differentiated in data oriented indicators i e indicators provided by stakeholders information oriented indicators i e calculated indicators from modelling for system s understanding and action oriented indicators i e circularity performance indicators calculated from modelling for circularity assessment thus information overload is avoided but at the same time access to information oriented and data indicators offer the possibility of understanding underlying factors processes or interactions that are linked with circularity 3 the mswca framework in this section the conceptual multi sectoral water circularity assessment mswca framework is presented aiming to bridge gaps and synthesise highlighted aspects mentioned in previous sections the framework fig 3 includes five distinct phases namely system development system synthesis system analysis assessment and system testing the main components of mswca are mfa natural systems models and economic valuation information oriented and action oriented i e circularity performance indicators cpi indicators as well as sensitivity and uncertainty analyses are incorporated into a modelling framework mswca follows a multi sectoral systems approach similar to the one developed by villarroel walker 2010 mswca considers different socio economic i e urban water energy food agriculture industry waste handling and non economic i e natural environment sectors and targets the symbiotic management of resources i e water energy nutrients and other materials as they flow through the different sectors the modelling approach enables the investigation of the feedback loops between the socio economic sectors and the environment as well as of the complex interactions between them therefore synergies and antagonisms among the different sectors are revealed and a balance between socio economic activities and environmental resilience is promoted the mswca is developed in line with the following principles to unlock data trapped in silos and overcome data inefficiencies by developing an indicators database to promote systems approach by assessing multi sectoral systems incorporating various resources making natural capital an integral component of systems circularity to estimate both the value in and of water by considering both market and non market sectors to holistically assess the circularity performance of multi sectoral systems both at systems and sectoral levels considering sensitivity and uncertainty analyses and to evaluate the impact of future interventions to achieve future circularity targets mswca stages include system development this phase involves the selection of the multi sectoral system all the involved socio economic sectors are specified and the system boundaries are expanded to include the physical boundaries of the surrounding natural environment the sectors include all the relevant unit processes process diagrams of the selected socio economic sectors fig 1 and consider the flows of the targeted resources i e water energy nitrogen carbon phosphorus other materials the inclusion or not of other materials resources such as metals minerals cellulose etc depends on the market needs and the additional industrial sector of interest in order to utilize and valorise the specific material the second phase of data acquisition is of major importance as it directly affects the quality accuracy and precision of the results data acquisition enables the calculation of natural and anthropogenic flows of resources therefore general data e g climate geomorphology lulc water energy nutrients other materials uses soil and water quality resource recovery etc are required additionally the state of certain ecological parameters is required to enable correlation between them and natural resource cycles several sources of information may be used to obtain the required data the source of information is related to the uncertainty level of the model and therefore to the sensitivity analysis in order to form a common baseline for data acquisition related to multi sectoral systems an indicators database is developed correlating the required data obtained in terms of required parameters and data oriented indicators to information oriented and action oriented indicators for circularity assessment section 4 system synthesis the first phase of system synthesis involves the geospatial representation of the studied multi sectoral system i e land use land cover of the system including number and type of buildings in their actual location and population the next phase built upon the previous one is the development of the integrated model for the multi sectoral system that includes four modelling components i e the socio economic sectors the non economic sector i e natural environment their nodes of intersection and the system as a whole the socio economic sectors are modelled using mfa based on developed mass balances the resource flows i e water nutrients energy and other materials required to solve the mass balances are calculated based on available data consumption and production patterns mass transfer coefficients and process equations the establishment of resource patterns transfer coefficients for each process and the application of different products lifetime functions enable the establishment of dynamic mfa that would facilitate the integration to the natural system models computational models can be also used to estimate specific resource flows or air emissions in case that higher precision is required the developed resource balances for each of the socio economic sectors result in quantification of inputs and outputs waste including emissions to air water and soil accumulation internal resource reuse recycling and resource materials to be recirculated to another socio economic sector at this stage the information to be transferred from each socio economic sector to the others as well as to the natural environment i e input to the natural system model is specified the different socio economic sectors are interconnected in the model via nodes indicating their physical interactions the nodes can be simulated using linear nonlinear and differential equations thresholds if then rules and demand supply functions integrating market simulation that is based on economic valuation and analysis the nodes also act as modules performing data mediation both semantically and structurally interoperable data flows according to wang and grant 2019 to enable data transfer from one model to the other the complexity of nodes simulation increases significantly if complex agent based models abm are integrated that can be used to simulate diffusion of innovation and adoption changes in policies individual behaviour etc the non economic sector i e the natural environment is modelled using natural system models and input data resulted from the human system models e g water withdrawals irrigation water nutrients inputs emissions etc and entering the natural system models via the feedback loop nodes static data e g soil and management conditions soil type and formations hydraulic conditions etc as well as dynamic data e g weather conditions obtained through data acquisition procedure are also used as model inputs hydro biogeochemical modelling enabling an integrated investigation of water carbon nutrient and sediment dynamics is suggested to simultaneously simulate the water and nutrients transport fate and cycling mass transfer is at the core of such models using a series of differential constitutive equations based on various processes e g diffusion reaction etc and their corresponding coefficients e g diffusion or mass transfer coefficients forces and fluxes are computed to solve field balance equations additionally ecological parameters such as biodiversity soil erosion etc are included in the model in the form of indicators as their relationship with the water and nutrients cycles is not straightforward statistical approaches can be used to investigate correlations the modelling output is mainly the quantification and qualification of different resources flows that re enter via the feedback loops nodes or affect the socio economic sectors integrated modelling is interacting via the nodes with market analysis and economic valuation for the non economic sector of natural environment non market valuation approaches i e revealed preference and stated preference methods are deployed for the economic valuation of water resource for the socio economic sectors the economic valuation targets water as an intermediate good water as a consumption good and indirect resources recovered from water using market valuation techniques for the recovered resources lca and lcc physical chemical and mechanical properties and regulatory standards are included in the analysis therefore this phase focuses on the elicitation of the value of water and of recovered resources in the different sectors and on the investigation of positive and negative externalities occurred from the socio economic sectors affecting the natural capital at this stage the multi sectoral system s model is solved and calibrated see the following section of system testing for the year of data acquisition and the identified indicators are calculated system analysis the results of the integrated model are interpreted graphical representations flow diagrams table matrices etc are created enabling the multi sectoral analysis of the system in terms of holistic performance synergies antagonisms feedback loops and identification of hotspots the system analysis phase is completed with the circularity assessment based on specific circularity metrics i e circularity performance indicators cpis the cpis consist of a set of whole of system and sector specific indicators and are categorized based on the ce principle that they target holistically assessing circularity of multi sectoral systems incorporating various resources system testing activities to identify characterize treat and communicate the uncertainties of the mswca are dynamic and run in parallel to all mswca stages from the selection of the multi sectoral system and conceptualization of the modelling study to the model integration and evaluation of the assessment outputs in the initial phases of the system development uncertainty sources are mapped qualitatively or quantitatively and prioritised acceptable levels of uncertainty are also defined in this phase this can help evaluate the system boundaries selected the completeness of sectors and flows considered in the assessment and guide the data collection i e identify data that will impact significantly the assessment output focus effort to improve their quality and model section processes i e identify the requirements and the temporal and spatial resolution of the models the uncertainties map can be updated during model development the integration of data and models used in the assessment is an important step in the analysis and needs to follow a systematic data assimilation framework to combine the heterogenous streams of data with the models accounting for the related uncertainties in a transparent and statistically robust way during the integrated modelling phase special attention is required to the calibration techniques followed the parameters of the model need to be selected to maximize the fit of the model with the data it is suggested either to calibrate the integrated model simultaneously can be computationally expensive or to calibrate the upstream model e g the natural system model and gradually integrate and calibrate the downstream modules e g the human system model etc to investigate how the variability of input conditions and how uncertainties of the inputs and models are translated into uncertainties of the integrated model outputs uncertainty and global sensitivity analyses are performed the sensitivity analysis indicates important parameters that significantly affect the reliability of the assessment results uncertainty analysis is used to obtain probability distributions the integrated model outputs and indicators based on the probability distributions of the input data the uncertainty of the model s output due to the uncertainty in the model s parameters and other input data is calculated using a set of uncertainty levels based on the quality range and the applicability of different sources of information finally clear communication of the uncertainties and reliability of the assessment results in a qualitative and quantitative way is vital to create trust in the assessment results and support decision making of the pathways to achieve the predefined circularity targets the final phase of mswca is the assessment by investigating the attainability of specific circularity targets in terms of cpis the goal of this phase is twofold to assess the circularity performance of the current system and to predict by understanding potential future behaviour of the system based on today s decisions i e the model is run again to predict future system trajectories and assess the ability of the system to reach the circularity targets in case that the system does not reach the quantifiable circularity targets strategic alternative scenarios can be tested 4 circularity performance indicators cpi the developed excel tool supplementary materials includes an indicators database for holistic circularity assessment of multi sectoral systems enabling information sharing for integrated management of resources it includes requirements on data that should be measured and collected for the quantification of the cpis the tool differentiates between required parameters and three types of indicators i e data oriented information oriented and action oriented i e cpis indicators parameters i e data requirements and data oriented indicators i e doi are based on information coming from different stakeholders and sources allowing the integrated modelling of the system parameter is defined as a factor that can be measured or observed doi are indicators that can provide information on matters of wider significance or make perceptible a trend or phenomenon that is not immediately detectable hammond et al 1995 the doi can be provided by stakeholders for example water demand use by sector is defined as a state indicator e g by unido and by european environment agency for recognising potential water conflicts an estimation of water demand can be provided by relevant stakeholders e g municipalities another example is the water supply service coverage or proportion of population served by the water supply industry that is defined by unsd 2008 as an indicator for water accessibility and its estimation can be provided relevant stakeholders as well information oriented indicators i e ioi consist of a long list of indicators that are resulted from modelling calculations based on parameters and doi during the implementation of the framework and they are not directly used in but rather support the assessment the assessment is based on action oriented indicators i e aoi named here as cpis aoi or cpis are derived from the integrated modelling and are calculated from further processing of ioi doi and parameters cpis are used for communication of the results and consist of a short list of indicators targeted at the three ce principles to reduce the number of indicators used for circularity assessment the ioi are indicators measuring circularity aspects indirectly and therefore are used to explain the outcomes of the assessment the ioi are not used for communicating the results of the assessment but they are accessible to the interested parties for informative purposes the tool includes existing and newly developed indicators the indicators tool is tailored to the multi sectoral system approach by differentiating between whole of a system and sector specific indicators i e indicators related to the system as a whole and to the urban water agro food energy industrial waste handling sectors and natural capital the tool also provides information about the units methodological aspects i e methodology equation or reference in order to calculate the indicator typology differentiating between descriptive efficiency and performance indicators level of measurement i e a 1st level indicator is a value derived from parameters a 2nd level indicator is derived from further processing a 1st level indicator into an equation or model and so on description and goal of the indicator the indicators are further categorized based on the type of information they provide i e generic economic information related to water nutrients substances energy biodiversity and information related to the ce principles regenerate natural capital and design out waste externalities principles contain consequential cpis while keep resources in use principle is measured with intrinsic cpis 5 conceptual example a circular city the mswca framework is applied in a conceptual example of a small city the imaginary city s electricity source is from renewables i e solar and wind energy the urban water sector consists of centralized water supply to meet the drinking water demands of the area using a surface natural resource centralised wastewater treatment receives only blackwater while greywater from the sinks and taps is treated separately decentralised greywater treatment and in combination with rainwater harvesting is used to meet the domestic demands i e toilet flushing washing machines and irrigation of gardens the centralised wastewater treatment is performed in one treatment plant and the treated effluent after disinfection is sent to a set of natural and humanmade wetlands the wetland system supplies the local agricultural water requirements the agro food sector consists of agriculture both livestock and crops and the agricultural production is sold in local markets the waste handling sector receives the produced sludge which is composted and used as soil amendment while livestock manure food and green waste are composted and sent back to agriculture for fertilization purposes all other types of waste are disregarded in this example the required information is collected in the form of parameters and data oriented indicators via the proposed indicator tool the configuration of the multi sectoral system is illustrated in fig 4 the next step of the framework includes the development of the integrated model parameters and data oriented indicators are used as inputs to the model for each one of the socio economic and non economic sectors mass balances are developed and model inputs are used to calculate all the required resource flows and to solve the developed mass balances for all the incorporated resources for the urban water sector daily water rates for water treatment use greywater and blackwater production treatment recycling and discharge are used in combination with precipitation data and catchment area for rainwater harvesting water resources permanent and seasonal population centralized and decentralized water users to calculate all the daily water flows in terms of inputs from the natural environment i e water withdrawals from the natural resource harvested rainwater internal recirculation for domestic water requirements storage in case of excess water and outputs to the natural environment discharge to the wetlands leakages and irrigation of gardens the nutrient flows of the urban water sector are calculated based on data from nutrient concentrations in raw water blackwater and greywater on the incorporated water volumes and treatment rates the calculations result in daily nutrient inputs from the natural environment and the agro food sector internal recirculation i e nutrients incorporated in the recirculation of domestic water storage and outputs to the environment in terms of emissions and discharge or disposal and to waste handling sector nutrients in sludge water flows are also accompanied with other critical substances e g chemicals used for treatment pathogens and other pollutants and their flows are also calculated based on their concentrations in water waste or usage rates the energy consumption in centralized and decentralized water and wastewater treatment are also calculated for the agro food sector nutrient and water flows incorporated in the local agricultural production are calculated based on hydro biogeochemical modelling using soil condition soil type and formations hydraulic conditions management practices weather data fertilizer inputs etc the quantification of water e g infiltration evapotranspiration irrigation runoff etc and nutrient e g nutrient surplus nutrient in crops nutrient in residuals gaseous emissions etc flows are the modelling outputs the local market receives locally produced food yields and imported food the green and food waste resulted in the agro food sector as well as the nutrient content in the waste are also calculated the energy consumption is calculated as well for the waste handling sector daily inputs of sludge and manure green and food waste received as well as their nutrient content are calculated the outputs include daily amount of produced compost to be recirculated to the agricultural sector and to the natural environment nutrients amounts in the produced compost and nutrient outputs diluted in produced wastewater in case of dewatering and fate nutrient emissions nutrient leakages nutrients in residual waste from screening and fate water vapour etc energy requirements are calculated as well hydro biogeochemical modelling is deployed to reveal the state of the natural environment in terms of nutrients and water cycles soil condition and biodiversity as well the quantification of water e g infiltration evapotranspiration water withdrawals runoff etc and nutrient e g nutrient surplus nutrient in crops nutrient in residuals gaseous emissions etc flows are the modelling outputs as well as the state of soil and biodiversity condition quality and quantity of water bodies and air quality or emissions all the quantified final outputs of the human system model serve as inputs to the natural system model while the calculated natural capital flows leaving the natural environment re enter the human system model the economic simulation is based on economic valuation of market and non market services and is run in tandem revealing economic changes in values either positive or negative due to the behaviour of the physical multi sectoral system the final step is the integration of all the different models by using developed equations functions and rules that describe the feedback loop and socio economic nodes these nodes determine the amount and frequency of the resource flows entering and leaving each modelling component the integrated system model is run solving the whole of a system daily seasonal and annual mass balances and revealing potential changes to the natural capital due to fast processes this is the completion of the first simulation loop sensitivity and uncertainty analyses are performed to investigate the uncertainty of the modelling outcomes and communicated to the relevant parties after ensuring the computability of the integrated model the information oriented indicators that were not used to solve the mass balances and the action oriented indicators are calculated in this conceptual example some of the ioi that are used to solve the water balances in the integrated modelling procedure include rainfall volume infiltration evapotranspiration runoff change in soil moisture water demand per sector actual irrigation water demand and others however the ioi of irrigation efficiency is not required to solve the water balances but it is further calculated as a ratio of water supplied for irrigation per actual irrigation demand to evaluate if the agricultural system is overwatered underwatered or sufficiently irrigated similarly the aoi of regenerative capacity index for water requires further calculation the total quantitative and qualitative water withdrawals of the system are compared to the natural water recharge volume of water of improved quality that is stored to the water bodies due to natural hydrological water cycle taking also into consideration the volume of water of the same quality that is returned to the water bodies from the anthropogenic water system after having calculated all the ioi and aoi cpis the results are presented and assessed the first step of the assessment is the presentation analysis and evaluation of the cpis the analysis reveals the extent of achieved intrinsic circularity of the different resources the consequent environmental and economic effects the synergies and antagonisms between the different sectors in terms of resources consumption and circularity and the identification of hotspots both current and future after the identification of system s hotspots the relevant information based indicators i e the ones connected to the cpis are analysed to understand the reason of system s failure and what actions are required to improve circularity the reasons might be technical physical economic social regulatory or policy and they should be communicated to the relevant parties to take appropriate actions for example if one of the identified hotspots is the gross p balance io indicators related to p cycling are analysed to understand if the reason is overfertilization low retention capacity of soil overwatering etc or if water stress is severe io indicators of environmental water use environmental water requirements water provisioning capacity alternative water use internal and intersectoral water recycling water intensity water demand requiring drinking water standards etc are further analysed to understand the reason of failure the analysis is performed internally and only the most probable reasons of failure are presented to the relevant stakeholders 6 conclusions to address water circularity fundamental changes are needed in the way water is managed and valued and in the way data is shared among practitioners policies regulations and assessment frameworks the proposed mswca framework approaches circularity from a multi sectoral perspective following a systems approach that symbiotically manages key water related socio economic and non economic sectors a visualization of the mswca s application to a fictional city is presented to enable the understanding of the framework and its practical use whilst developing the mswca framework we identified a number of hurdles the consistency and valid flow of input information is one of the identified hurdles to overcome this problem we suggest the indicators tool the tool establishes a common baseline for data requirements and indicators to be used for the assessment the next identified issue is the economic valuation of nonmarket goods to overcome this issue the mswca framework suggests the use of both revealed and stated preference methods the third issue relates to feedback loops and interdependencies between different sectors and the natural environment this framework offers a novel methodology to link natural environment to human system models integration also entails seamless data exchange between different system components making data interoperability a necessity the mswca framework provides the environment for the interaction of data from multiple sources thus facilitating integrated modelling integration increased data volume and modelling complexities creates uncertainties the proposed framework also suggests qualitative and quantitative

17486,natural wetlands have been recognized as a natural reactor for degradation and elimination of environmental pollutants the upo wetland the largest inland wetland in korea is mainly surrounded by agricultural lands and it is susceptible to contamination from excess nutrient loads and synthetic organic contaminants socs e g pesticides the aim of this study was to identify major socs in the wetland and evaluate their degradation we used high resolution mass spectrometry hrms with a two step analysis approach i e 1st analysis for target measurement along with suspect and non target screening snts and 2nd analysis for complimentary suspect screening to identify and quantify the transformation products tps of the identified parent socs quantitative analysis of 30 targets mainly including pesticides showed that fungicides were the major socs detected in the wetland accounting for about 50 of the composition ratio of the total socs quantified orysastrobin occurred at the highest mean concentration 700 ng l followed by two other fungicides carbendazim and tricyclazole the first analysis snts tentatively identified 39 tps 30 by suspect 9 by non target screening of 14 parent pesticides additionally the second analysis complimentary suspect screening identified 9 more tps among the 48 total tps identified 7 were confirmed with reference standards the identification of the remaining tps had a high confidence level e g level 2 or 3 regarding transport though the wetland most tps showed greater peak area ratios i e the relative portion of chromatographic area of the tps to the parent compound at the outlet point of the wetland compared to the inlet point the risk quotient which was calculated using the concentrations of parent compounds decreased toward the outlet demonstrating the degradation capacity of the wetland the estimates for biodegradability hydrophobicity and toxicity by an in silico quantitative structure activity relationship qsar model indicated a lower half life lower logdow and greater effect concentration for most tps compared to the parent compounds based on these results we conclude that natural wetlands play a role as an eco friendly reactor for degrading socs to form numerous tps that are lower risk than the parent compounds graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords natural wetland fungicides transformation products lc hrms suspect and non target screening 1 introduction the prolific use of synthetic organic chemicals socs has led to the contamination of natural wetlands wetlands serve as a natural sink for socs but they are also capable of degrading them li et al 2019 the extensive decomposition ability is mainly due to the biological activities of diverse fauna and flora and the high density of microorganisms physical chemical processes e g generation of hydroxyl radicals via photolysis are also involved in the degradation as supplementary reactions lányi et al 2016 upon degradation of socs in wetlands several potential and diverse transformation products tps are formed li et al 2017 many of these tps have yet to be identified and thus there is a significant knowledge gap about their environmental fate and eco toxicity many tps in surface waters form from aerobic processes yin et al 2019 some tps are formed under anaerobic conditions if electron acceptors e g sulfur are available to replace oxygen n kumar et al 2017 under either condition the rate of transformation can be dramatically increased in the presence of microorganisms serving as a bio catalyst svan et al 2016 wetlands are ideal for environments for hosting these conditions and their slow flow rate enhances the transformation as such wetlands are capable of achieving high removal rates for many pollutants e g nutrients metals socs li et al 2019 rai 2019 artificial wetlands have been used to treat contaminants e g pharmaceuticals industrial chemicals in lieu of a wastewater treatment plant wwtp rooney et al 2015 tp identification is the first step into the detailed insight of degradation processes in wetlands yet there is still great uncertainty about the structure and toxicity of tps identifying these tps is a critical challenge for various reasons including tps are generally present at trace concentrations li et al 2017 tps can continually form further tps through stepwise reactions until mineralization kaur et al 2018 wetland water is a complex matrix making treatment difficult dordio et al 2010 rapid improvements in analytical methods has made it feasible to identify unknown chemical structures of the tps for example high resolution mass spectrometry hrms instruments enable simultaneous suspect and non target screening snts along with target screening and it has been used to detect unknown compounds and tps in diverse samples including environmental media choi et al 2019 jeon and hollender 2019 as the applicability of target screening depends entirely on the availability of reference standards such target assays are virtually impossible for tps having no standards the ability of hrms to measure the accurate mass of substances allows the assignment of molecular formulas which enables substance identification and molecular structure elucidation suspect and non target screening which benefits from the performance of hrms is critically distinguished by the presence of a suspected substance list in general many tps are either already known through previous studies or predictable or suspectable based on the molecular structure of the parent compound indicating that the suspect screening can be used non target screening can be used as a complement to the suspect analysis when tp structure prediction fails the snts approach can be used when it is difficult to predict all possible suspects due to the large number of parent substances e g wetland the upo wetland located in changnyeong gun is korea s largest natural inland wetland fig 1 the upo system is composed of four wetlands and its name is derived from the largest of the wetlands upo linked with three sub wetlands called mokpo sajipo and jjokji beol fig 1 the wetlands are home to numerous and diverse species including over 800 plants 209 birds 28 fish 180 benthic invertebrates and 17 mammals ministry of environment 2016 as an international recognition of the ecological value upo was registered as a wetland of ramsar convention on march 2 1998 upo is adjacent to agricultural land use and these operations have contaminated the wetland with numerous pesticides kang and jeon 2018 the region surrounding upo has the largest production area and output of garlic in korea occupying 12 of the national garlic cultivation area changnyeong gun 2019 black mold is a common disease occurring in garlic and other allium species and fungicides e g triazole strobilurin are used heavily in this area to control it efsa 2011 through overuse and runoff from precipitation and irrigation these fungicides can potentially enter upo considering upo is connected upstream to the nakdong river which is used as a drinking water source for about 1 million populations the treatment degradation capability of the wetland for pollutants has been a key interest the aim of this study was to identify upo s major socs and their tps to provide insight into the degradation processes in the wetland by comparing data from inlet and outlet sampling points we used hrms for a stepwise snts analysis to identify tps while simultaneously performing quantitative target analysis the tp identification results were subjected to parameter estimations and predictions for hydrophobicity biodegradability and toxicity the transformation index which is a ratio of chromatographic area of the tp to the parent compound was used as an indirect estimation for the significance of transformation the calculated risk quotient rq was compared between the inlet and outlet of the wetland these predictions and assessments comprehensively assessed the value of the upo wetland as a treatment system of socs stemming from agricultural use 2 material and methods 2 1 characteristics of upo wetland the upo wetland is spread over 2 13 km2 upo 1 28 km2 mokpo 0 53 km2 sajipo 0 36 km2 and jjokji beol 0 13 km2 topyeongcheon is a stream running mainly through the upper part of upo which is divided into two parts by a natural levee fig 1 and it occasionally flows over the levee toward the lower part during flood events the stream transports contaminants from the surrounding area into the wetlands in addition there are three minor streams as input sources the pyeongjicheon flows into sajipo whereas the other two are upstream of mokpo m1 nameless small stream m2 chogokcheon the inlets of topyeong u2 sajipo u1 and mokpo m6 serve as hydraulic inlets of upo according to land use data ministry of environment 2019 most of the wetland watershed about 37 3 km2 is used as agricultural land fig 1 in particular allium crops e g onion and garlic are intensively cultivated in about 20 8 km2 or 55 8 of the total catchment area 2 2 sampling and pretreatment five sampling campaigns were conducted from march 2018 to

were used for structure confirmation and elucidation detailed information about instrumental analysis is listed in table si a 2 2 4 identification and quantification of major pollutants target and suspect screening methods were performed to identify major pollutants in the wetlands tracefinder 4 1 thermo fisher scientific usa was used to quantify 30 target compounds table si a 6 target lists were established for compounds that were detected in previous screening and to determine if their own internal standards istd were available kang and jeon 2018 all of targets were quantified with the internal standard method all chemicals that were used are listed in table si a 5 the calibration curves were constructed with 14 points ranging from 0 1 to 2 000 ng l parallel with target screening suspect screening was conducted with the help of tracefinder 4 1 and xcalibur software thermo fisher scientific usa an in house suspect library was established through a literature survey including the pesticides that are expected to remain and persist namely environmental pesticide residues from the report of national institute of agricultural sciences of korea the swisspest list from the norman suspect list exchange and pharmaceuticals that were detected frequently in korean surface waters details in si b the list includes 347 parent compounds plus tps suspected as being used at high concentrations and or persistent in the wetland and its surrounding area the identifications for suspect compounds were preferentially done for samples collected in march september and november of 2018 n 50 identified suspect compounds were subjected to the confirmation process if relevant standards were available among the confirmed quantifiable substances were integrated into the existing target list the quantitative evaluations for the previous samples were then repeated with the integrated target list and the rebuilt calibration curves accordingly the next samples collected in january and march of 2019 n 30 were analyzed with the integrated quantification method one way anova was used to determine the significant differences between each compounds and sampling periods an anova test with 95 confidence was used and significance is defined by p 0 05 more detail information about identification and quantification sequence is described in si a compounds with an average concentration greater than 20 ng l were selected as major contaminants in the wetland 2 5 two step analysis approach for identification of tps in a previous study we identified azole fungicides e g tebuconazole tricyclazole as major contaminants in upo kang and jeon 2018 based on the results information on their tps were collected from literature survey for more identifications we applied a two step analysis approach i e 1st analysis for target measurement along with suspect and non target screening snts and 2nd suspect screening more details provided in fig 2 to establish the 1st suspect list a literature review was done si b 2 an in house tp suspect list was complied with 624 tps containing information on the compound name exact mass and structure formula furthermore candidates i e vulnerable structures that are easily subject to further transformation for the 2nd suspect list was established mainly with analogue structures or precursors descendants of identified tps si b 3 2 6 estimation assessment and prediction for transformation products the transformation index ti is the relative ratio of the tp chromatogram area to the parent compound area even though the peak area ratio does not necessarily indicate a relative concentration because of differences in ionization efficiency between tps and their parent compound the ratio reflects the significance of the transformation for the entire degradation process and the transformation magnitude of the original parent form although the authentic quantification for tps was not feasible due to the lack of reference standard an indirect estimation using chromatographic peak area has been suggested elsewhere to evaluate the significance masbou et al 2018 the ti was calculated as follows transformation index ti chromatogram peak area of tps chromatogram peak area of the parent by comparing the ratio of the peak areas the differences in the extent of transformation between substances and the increase decrease patterns in the transformation can be explained to assess the favorable changes of eco toxicological risk the pnec predicted non effect concentration value for rq method was determined using the ecotox database https cfpub epa gov ecotox usepa the rq was determined as following equation rq mec measured environmental concentration pnec predicted non effect concentration the rq level of concern was set to 1 0 thus sum of rq for all measured compounds above 1 would indicate a potential risk at the site the hydrophobicity logdow https chemicalize com and biodegradability were estimated using prediction tools biowin usepa more details about estimation and prediction are provided in the si estimation assessment and prediction for tps si a 3 results and discussion 3 1 major pollutants the quantitative analysis detected 25 out of 30 target compounds the original target list table si a 6 at least once in any of the 80 samples ten compounds 7 parent compounds 3 tps were identified by snts and then included in the original target list hence from the 1st suspect screening 9 pesticides boscalid dimethenamid dimethoate ethoprophos fluopyram fluxapyroxad metconazole orysastrobin and propiconazole were additionally identified and then confirmed by reference standards except for dimethoate no available standard among the confirmed 7 pesticides dimethenamid ethoprophos fluopyram fluxapyroxad metconazole orysastrobin and propiconazole were subject to quantification analysis afterwards of the tps identified by the 1st suspect screening 7 tps 2 aminobenzimidazole 2 hydroxybenzimidazole 2 isopropyl 6 methyl 4 pyrimidinol 2 aminobenzothiazole teb m324a teb m324d and thiacloprid amide were confirmed but only 3 tps 2 aminobenzimidazole teb m324a teb m324d were quantified the calibration curve was established for 14 points 0 1 0 5 1 2 5 10 20 50 70 100 200 500 1 000 2 000 ng l and the linearity of the calibration curve for 40 targets 30 compounds the original target list 10 compounds identified by snts exceeded an r2 value of 0 99 the limit of detection was lower than 0 5 ng l for all compounds and limit of quantification ranged from 0 5 to 5 0 ng l table si a 7 the calculated coefficient of variance was less than 25 for all compounds the absolute recovery rates were approximately 75 to 125 except fluoxetine and prometryn which were 72 and 63 respectively fig si a 2 of those quantified 30 compounds 85 were detected above a 50 detection frequency these substances were prioritized based on their average concentration fig 3 among them pesticides accounted for 83 in the composition ratio fungicides had the highest ratio of 42 the composition of each class of compounds with an average concentration above 20 ng l defined as major pollutants shows that pesticides were dominant 89 particularly fungicides 47 as shown in fig 3 orysastrobin was detected at the highest average concentration 740 380 ng l followed by carbendazim 270 370 ng l and tricyclazole 210 690 ng l orysastrobin is commonly used in combination with azole fungicides e g tricyclazole for crop cultivations as tricyclazole tebuconazole and propiconazole showed relatively high concentrations 210 ng l 120 ng l and 50 ng l respectively azoles trios are likely dominant agents to control fungal growth on allium in the region in addition dimethenamid 110 410 ng l is used to control garlic pests since most of the major pollutants are components of pesticides related to the cultivation of allium crops there is no doubt that the contamination of the upo wetland is greatly impacted by the cultivation of allium crops by the adjacent agriculture to determine the seasonal pattern of pesticides in the upo wetland the cumulative concentrations in different subgroups as a function of the season are shown in fig si a 3 the cumulative concentration of fungicides was higher than other subcategories for all seasons sampled fungicides were detected at the highest concentrations in november and march this is related to the seasonal agricultural activities in korea allium crops are in general sown at the end of october with a wide usage of pesticides in march pesticides are sprayed to prevent diseases once again before the spring season two azole fungicides tebuconazole p 0 05 tricyclazole p 0 05 showed significant differences with seasons on the contrary orysastrobin an emerging pesticide basf 2009 with little information but limited to hydrolysis half life dt50 of 365d showed no seasonal differences p 0 05 with the monthly average concentrations ranged from 690 to 890 ng l fig si a 3 in the case of insecticides a u shaped pattern was observed fig si a 3 two major insecticides ethoprophos and carbofuran have been applied in different seasons national institute of agricultural sciences 2019 ethoprophos is sprayed pre sowing while carbofuran is mainly sprayed before the spring season the spatial distribution pattern of the pollutants was discussed in section 3 4 among the major pollutants detected tebuconazole exceeded the limit of the european union drinking water directive 98 83 ec 100 ng l showing similar levels to those of wwtp influents and effluents stamatis et al 2010 westlund and yargeau 2017 the use of tricyclazole for plant protection has recently been revoked in the commission regulation eu 2017 983 ispra 2018 these two azoles are persistent in aqueous systems and also frequently detected in european surface waters mascolo et al 2019 the organophosphate insecticide ethoprophos 120 430 ng l is also banned under ec regulation 1107 2009 91 414 eec another major insecticide in the wetland was deet n n diethyl 3 methylbenzamide with a mean concentration of 27 36 ng l this ache inhibitor has been frequently detected in domestic surface waters yoon et al 2010 including treated u s drinking water stackelberg et al 2004 in our study deet was also observed to have a high detection frequency of 98 prochloraz is applied to various crops but it is often mixed with pesticides for garlic pest prevention with tebuconazole prochloraz showed a lower detection frequency of 18 it is expected to be actively degraded in a wetland system because of its short half life dt50 1 3 6 4 d efsa 2015a we identified one tp prz m325 as evidence of its degradation some neonicotinoids imidacloprid thiacloprid and acetamiprid recently specified as eu watch list compounds eu decision 2018 840 2018 were frequently detected from 67 to 94 imidacloprid and thiacloprid exceeded the chronic environmental quality standard eqs up to 5 1 fold imidacloprid eqs 13 ng l and 2 1 fold thiacloprid eqs 10 ng l respectively the quantification results include the concentrations of 3 tps teb m324a teb m324d and 2 aminobenzimidazole at levels relatively lower than their parents fig 3 2 aminobenzimidazole is a representative tp of carbendazim but would rapidly transform to another form tp e g 2 hydroxybenzimidazole by further transform reaction such as hydroxylation boudina et al 2003 along with pesticides and their tps other micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals were also quantified the detection of caffeine provides supporting evidence that the wetland is a sink for treated municipal wastewater the presence of the veterinary antibiotic sulfamethoxazole implies that contamination is occurring from nearby livestock farms since benzotriazole is widely used as anticorrosive agent in both industrial and municipal applications the exact possible point sources cannot be identified detailed measured concentrations including the nearest surface water samples nakdong river nd1 and nd2 are listed in si a 8 to 12 3 2 identification of tps the tp identification with 1st suspect screening and non target screening 1st step analysis approach was done following the workflow described in fig 2 thirty tps were tentatively identified from the 1st suspect screening subsequent non target screening identified 9 other tps the following 2nd suspect screening identified 9 tps resulting in a total of 48 tps tentatively identified table 1 these 48 tps originated from 14 parent pesticides classified with the confidence level identification detailed previously schymanski et al 2014 among these 7 tps were confirmed while 35 tps still had higher confidence levels level 2 for 23 level 3 for 12 fig si a 9 to 25 fig si a 28 to 44 fig si a 46 47 a description of the structure of the identified tp is shown in table si a 14 six tps were level 4 due to no sufficient structural ms ms data found fig si a 26 27 and 45 in the following sub sections detailed identification information is further described with a focus on two major substances with the most abundant numbers of distinct tps detected tebuconazole had 16 tricyclazole had 7 3 2 1 tebuconazole a total of 16 tebuconazole tps were separated using lc hrms and their structure was identified by accurate ms ms data tebuconazole had the highest numbers of tps in wetland samples and all tps shared triazole ring fragment m z 70 0400 a key ms ms feature of the structural elucidation it is consistent with previous tp identifications with the identical fragment mercadante et al 2014 many previous studies on tp identification have been done for tebuconazole fundamentally main degradation transformation mechanism of tebuconazole are hydroxylation oxidation and dechlorination stamatis et al 2015 at m z 324 1423 4 isomer tps i e teb m324a d were detected indicating hydroxylation or oxidation had occurred at diverse molecular bonds these isomers have been reported in invertebrate metabolisms soil rösch et al 2017 2016 storck et al 2016a and in humans mercadante et al 2014 two products teb m324a and teb m324d were confirmed with reference standards during the 1st suspect screening teb m324d was not positive due to a low peak intensity 1 105 however it was positive in a manual evaluation procedure since the peak had a normal shape and the corresponding ms ms included a diagnostic fragment m z 141 0101 teb m324c was distinguished with a unique fragment m z 97 1013 in comparison with available databases et250501 mona fig si a 31 this fragment was not detected for any other peaks those oxidation tps were measured with different retention times depending on the attachment position of oxygen suggesting that isoform tps exhibit different bioaccumulative tendencies teb m224 one of a major tebuconazole tps showed the highest peak area among tebuconazole tps up to 2 2 108 this result is consistent with a former soil study potter et al 2005 that showed the tp concentration was 8 times greater than tebuconazole it had two diagnostic fragments m z 70 0400 99 0441 strickland et al 2004 which are conclusive evidence for triazole and lactone rings fig si a 35 teb m274 with m z 274 1911 and empirical formula c16h24n3o formed with dechlorination from tebuconazole the biotic dechlorination of tebuconazole in the natural environment has rarely been reported rösch et al 2017 2016 storck et al 2016b though one study has shown that the dechlorination can take a place catalytically stamatis et al 2015 hence the detection of teb m274 supports the hypothesis that organisms in wetlands serve as biocatalysts rapidly accelerating the degradation of tebuconazole 3 2 2 tricyclazole fig si a 1 shows examples of tps identified from tricyclazole for tri m206a several diagnostic ms ms fragments and neutral losses were evident a fragment at m z 188 0272 implied dehydration from the precursor fig si a 1 some neutral mass losses were identified with m z 161 0169 and 134 0059 indicating the cleavage of triazole several fragments such as m z 161 0169 151 0323 134 0059 and 124 0218 indicate that tri m206a has a thiazole ring fig si a 42 the formation of an alcohol moiety was expected to increase hydrophilicity relative to the parent compound and the calculated logdow also showed a lower value 0 1 1 7 tricyclazole by one magnitude order due to the wide detection of tri m206a the framework under directive 91 414 eec investigated the stability of tri m206a concluding it would be stable at temperatures less than or equal to 18 c for up to 6 months in rice efsa 2013 the alcohol moiety would be easily transformed to carboxylic acid which was confirmed in the present study through the identification of tri m220 the carboxylic form was not suspected as a candidate and thus identified via non target screening with strong evidence i e diagnostic ms ms neutral mass loss as described in fig si a 41 products with carboxylic acid have been rarely detected in environmental samples possibly because such highly hydrophilic substances show in general a low spe recovery in the enrichment step for those hydrophilies we used env and ion exchangers that are specialized for the enrichment of hydrophilic and or ionizable compounds aside the abundant oxygen in the wetland system mean do value 9 7 mg l would accelerate the oxidation of tri m206a forming carboxylated tp tri m220 sulfuric acid forms such as tri m240 and tri m238 were also detected fig si a 39 40 tri m238 has been detected in soil and even groundwater efsa 2015b whereas tri m240 was reported in blue green algae wu et al 2018 the estimated logdow for tri m240 1 8 suggests the high possibility of occurrence in surface and ground waters kiefer et al 2019 3 3 degradation pathways of major pollutants a transformation pathway in the wetland system is proposed for tebuconazole tricyclazole and deet all which produced at least three tps above confidence level 3 fig 4 and fig si a 4 5 fig 4 shows the proposed oxidative transformation pathway based on the 16 tps identified for tebuconazole the dominant reactions are hydroxylation and demethylation the hydroxylation tps e g teb m324a d and teb m290 are formed with the replacement of h by oh the hydroxylation of tebuconazole has been reported for various media and organisms jeon et al 2013a 2013b jeon and hollender 2019 rösch et al 2016 benzene ring opening which can occur from oxidation and hydroxylation reactions obanda et al 2008 obanda and shupe 2009 has been reported as for a microbial biotransformation in an open wetland system svan et al 2016 yin et al 2019 the phenyl residues of tebuconazole are more fragile to degradation than 1 2 4 triazole moiety storck et al 2016a strickland et al 2004 which is consistent with our results on the modification of chloro phenyl after dechlorination teb m274 was further transformed to sub tps via ring opening and demethylation teb m224 showed the most abundant peak intensity among tebuconazole tps in our study there is no certainty that teb m224 is the final product we identified teb m242 as evidence of the teb m224 variant with a γ hydroxy butyric acid moiety that can be transformed to γ lactone depending on ph conditions el et al 2018 storck et al 2016a for the formation of γ lactone further nucleophilic reaction occurred with internal dehydration fig 4 tricyclazole a three ring species showed 7 tps with various ring modifications fig si a 4 tricyclazole transformed into the alcohol form of tri m206a through a hydroxylation reaction at the methyl moiety tri m206a was also transformed to a carboxyl acid form tri m220 the formation of tri m206a and tri m220 have been reported in studies with blue green algae and rice and they have a similar persistence as the parent compound efsa 2015b n kumar et al 2017 the breakdown of thiazole ring of tricyclazole was also observed forming tri m240 tri m238 and tri m206b showing dissociation of s c bond notably tri m206b an intermediate tp toward tri m238 from tricyclazole has not been detected in the environment and it has only been identified in a study of isotope labeled tricyclazole biosynthesis balcer et al 2011 tps formed with the cleavage of s c bond i e tri m240 and m238 are of concerns due to the persistency in the environment which is comparable to the parent efsa 2015b tri m165 is the only tp formed from the cleavage of 1 2 4 triazole in our study the 1 2 4 triazole form is recalcitrant in the environment and its transformation is reported only under optimized conditions with sphingomonas wu et al 2018 2016 after the ring cleavage decyanation of other rings a hydration reaction and the final mineralization reaction would follow wu et al 2018 we propose a deet transformation pathway in the wetland fig si a 5 including 3 tps formed via amide n deethylation deet m164 deet m136 and hydroxylation deet m137 deet m164 and deet m136 are known to be unstable and thus quickly disappeared within several days in a bioreactor helbling et al 2010 in our study the deet m136 peak disappeared at the downstream sampling point u5 this suggests that deet was converted to more biodegradable forms that would be harder to detect however these would presumably be easier to degrade as well 3 4 evaluation of degradation capacity with transformation index to evaluate the extent to which upo wetland contributes to the degradation of socs the concentrations of major socs at the inlets m1 m2 u1 and u2 and outlet u5 were directly compared each input is well controlled by the hydrologic gates at the inlet points the flow rate is slow and steady state unless flooding occurs kim et al 2019 table 2 lists the concentrations of five major pollutants detected in november 2018 when the cumulative concentration of all compounds was the highest all of the pollutant concentrations were higher at the inlet points than the outlet point u5 for example orysastrobin was introduced at the m1 and m2 inlets with the highest concentration of 2 400 ng l and 1 500 ng l respectively however at the u5 outlet the concentration was 470 ng l demonstrating a dramatic decrease by above 70 of the input concentrations it is a notable decrease considering that orysastrobin is persistent in water and moderately mobile in soil koc 18 150 ml g the decrease can be attributable to numerous elimination mechanisms including sorption evaporation hydrolysis biodegradation etc nevertheless there is strong evidence that pesticide degradation occurs throughout the wetland because of occurrence of two tps ory m408 and ory m365 similar decreasing trends were observed for dimethenamid tebuconazole carbendazim and metalaxyl but to different extents table 2 for estimating the removal amount of socs recorded flow rates in upo were used whenever available for the last decade kim et al 2008 because the exact hydraulic mass balance of upo could not be calculated due to various reasons e g long hydraulic retention time significant amount of water evaporation often usage of water for irrigation an estimation was made using the flow rate data the flow rate information was obtained only for m6 u1 u2 and u5 points table si a 15 and used to calculate the input output mass loads of pollutants as shown in table 2 the estimate indicates that the major socs were removed at least 80 at the outlet heading into the nakdong river interestingly the removal rates for carbendazim and tebuconazole are even higher than ones reported in a conventional wwtp table 2 fig 5 summarizes the tis for tebuconazole and prochloraz and their tps for the parent compounds the highest peak area was measured at the inlets the ti of tebuconazole increased gradually along the streams up to three times higher compared to the inlet point suggesting that the degradation of tebuconazole occurred in the wetland teb m224 is the major tebuconazole tp with the highest area portion among all tebuconazole tps the proportion increased slightly from 31 of inlet to 42 in the outlet in contrast teb m274 with dechlorination recorded 3 of area proportion with tebuconazole in outlet with one magnitude order higher than inlets 0 2 for prochloraz a marked ti increase was also observed in the outlet although it fluctuated in the middle of mokpo compared to the nakdong river nd1 nd2 the receiving water of the upo wetland the ti values for tebuconazole and prochloraz in the wetland were higher tebuconazole 0 4 2 8 of m6 prochloraz 3 2 8 7 of u5 suggesting that wetland can transform pesticides to tps 3 5 potential risk and mitigation to estimate the potential harms of pollutants to organisms at occurring concentration levels a risk assessment was conducted using rq calculations as illustrated in fig si a 6 the inlet points such as u1 u2 m1 and m2 at november 2018 had an rq above 1 whereas the outlet point u5 was lower risk with an rq less than 1 and as low as 0 4 this decreased rq at outlet demonstrated that upo wetland mitigates eco toxicological potential by elimination of active parent substances the formation of diverse tps is a critical elimination mechanism the tps may have different physicochemical characteristics from the parent compound sinclair and boxall 2003 the differences inevitably result in the distinctions in environmental fates that can be estimated with parameters such as hydrophobicity and biodegradability qsar based estimates for those parameters biowin usepa are shown in fig 6 and fig si a 7 for reliable estimations only tps with a distinct molecular structure above confidence level 3 were computed into the model hydrophobicity was estimated with a logdow value at ph of 7 4 which is a representative ph in the upo mean value of ph 8 5 table si a 1 in case of tebuconazole the logdow was 3 7 suggesting its high bioaccumulative ability however most tebuconazole tps showed lower logdow values than the parent indicating reduced bioaccumulation and thus less risky fig 6 a the shorter retention time in chromatography of tps is further evidence for the lower hydrophobicity table 2 the environmental significance of tps was estimated by comparing the relative biodegradability over the parent compound using in silico qsar models fig 6 b and fig si a 7 all compounds were classified either as readily degradable probability 0 5 or not readily degradable probability 0 5 both qsar models resulted in a value 0 0028 for tebuconazole indicating its low biodegradability according to biowin results with the exception of tec m324c the biodegradability for all of tebuconazole tps increased even though they are classified as not readily degradable by model the enhanced biodegradability for tps suggests that the wetland can transform recalcitrant substances to tps with increased degradability the toxicity estimations conducted with the ecosar model for most of identified tps are shown in fig 6 c only one tp teb m306 showed greater toxicity than tebuconazole for daphnia and fish the moieties that contributed the most to the toxicity of teb m306 were 1 2 4 triazole and the c c double bond near the alcohol moiety allyl group schultz and yarbrough 2004 the carbendazim tps 2 aminobenzimidazole and 2 hydroxybenzimidazole are phytotoxic due to their unhindered aniline bai et al 2017 but less so than the parent compound carbendazim gatidou and iatrou 2011 panda et al 2018 further these tps are expected to degrade faster than carbendazim as observed in an alkaline wetland ph 8 5 boudina et al 2003 4 conclusions the novel screening approach used in this study with the stepwise suspect non target screening extended the knowledge on socs present in the upo wetland and provided new information about their degradation fates in natural wetlands suspect non target identifications of unrecognized contaminants including diverse tps were observed some of which were then integrated into the final target list the integrated target analysis quantified 30 out of 40 targets mostly consisting of pesticides the quantification results found fungicides as the major socs in the wetland accounting for about 50 of the total quantified orysastrobin occurred at the highest mean concentration 700 ng l followed by two other fungicides carbendazim and tricyclazole these fungicides are known to be intensively used for garlics and onions which are representative crops in the region insecticides and herbicides also accounted for a significant portion 34 of the total quantified nevertheless the socs showed a notable decrease in concentration between the inlet and the outlet u5 of the wetland leading to lower rqs with a high density in house suspect list comprising approximately 970 pesticides and tps combined with the 2 step suspect screening we identified 48 pesticide tps seven tps were finally confirmed with reference standards whereas the identifications for the other tps successfully acquired high confidence levels levels 2 or 3 by providing diagnostic structural evidences from the ms ms database comparisons and or fragment elucidations at least 16 7 and 7 tps of tebuconazole tricyclazole and orysastrobin were detected respectively some tps ory m408 ory m365 were detected for the first time in the surface waters parameter estimations and predictions for hydrophobicity biodegradability and toxicity provide strong evidence that most tps are lower risk in these categories compared to the parent compounds

17486,natural wetlands have been recognized as a natural reactor for degradation and elimination of environmental pollutants the upo wetland the largest inland wetland in korea is mainly surrounded by agricultural lands and it is susceptible to contamination from excess nutrient loads and synthetic organic contaminants socs e g pesticides the aim of this study was to identify major socs in the wetland and evaluate their degradation we used high resolution mass spectrometry hrms with a two step analysis approach i e 1st analysis for target measurement along with suspect and non target screening snts and 2nd analysis for complimentary suspect screening to identify and quantify the transformation products tps of the identified parent socs quantitative analysis of 30 targets mainly including pesticides showed that fungicides were the major socs detected in the wetland accounting for about 50 of the composition ratio of the total socs quantified orysastrobin occurred at the highest mean concentration 700 ng l followed by two other fungicides carbendazim and tricyclazole the first analysis snts tentatively identified 39 tps 30 by suspect 9 by non target screening of 14 parent pesticides additionally the second analysis complimentary suspect screening identified 9 more tps among the 48 total tps identified 7 were confirmed with reference standards the identification of the remaining tps had a high confidence level e g level 2 or 3 regarding transport though the wetland most tps showed greater peak area ratios i e the relative portion of chromatographic area of the tps to the parent compound at the outlet point of the wetland compared to the inlet point the risk quotient which was calculated using the concentrations of parent compounds decreased toward the outlet demonstrating the degradation capacity of the wetland the estimates for biodegradability hydrophobicity and toxicity by an in silico quantitative structure activity relationship qsar model indicated a lower half life lower logdow and greater effect concentration for most tps compared to the parent compounds based on these results we conclude that natural wetlands play a role as an eco friendly reactor for degrading socs to form numerous tps that are lower risk than the parent compounds graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords natural wetland fungicides transformation products lc hrms suspect and non target screening 1 introduction the prolific use of synthetic organic chemicals socs has led to the contamination of natural wetlands wetlands serve as a natural sink for socs but they are also capable of degrading them li et al 2019 the extensive decomposition ability is mainly due to the biological activities of diverse fauna and flora and the high density of microorganisms physical chemical processes e g generation of hydroxyl radicals via photolysis are also involved in the degradation as supplementary reactions lányi et al 2016 upon degradation of socs

structures of the tps for example high resolution mass spectrometry hrms instruments enable simultaneous suspect and non target screening snts along with target screening and it has been used to detect unknown compounds and tps in diverse samples including environmental media choi et al 2019 jeon and hollender 2019 as the applicability of target screening depends entirely on the availability of reference standards such target assays are virtually impossible for tps having no standards the ability of hrms to measure the accurate mass of substances allows the assignment of molecular formulas which enables substance identification and molecular structure elucidation suspect and non target screening which benefits from the performance of hrms is critically distinguished by the presence of a suspected substance list in general many tps are either already known through previous studies or predictable or suspectable based on the molecular structure of the parent compound indicating that the suspect screening can be used non target screening can be used as a complement to the suspect analysis when tp structure prediction fails the snts approach can be used when it is difficult to predict all possible suspects due to the large number of parent substances e g wetland the upo wetland located in changnyeong gun is korea s largest natural inland wetland fig 1 the upo system is composed of four wetlands and its name is derived from the largest of the wetlands upo linked with three sub wetlands called mokpo sajipo and jjokji beol fig 1 the wetlands are home to numerous and diverse species including over 800 plants 209 birds 28 fish 180 benthic invertebrates and 17 mammals ministry of environment 2016 as an international recognition of the ecological value upo was registered as a wetland of ramsar convention on march 2 1998 upo is adjacent to agricultural land use and these operations have contaminated the wetland with numerous pesticides kang and jeon 2018 the region surrounding upo has the largest production area and output of garlic in korea occupying 12 of the national garlic cultivation area changnyeong gun 2019 black mold is a common disease occurring in garlic and other allium species and fungicides e g triazole strobilurin are used heavily in this area to control it efsa 2011 through overuse and runoff from precipitation and irrigation these fungicides can potentially enter upo considering upo is connected upstream to the nakdong river which is used as a drinking water source for about 1 million populations the treatment degradation capability of the wetland for pollutants has been a key interest the aim of this study was to identify upo s major socs and their tps to provide insight into the degradation processes in the wetland by comparing data from inlet and outlet sampling points we used hrms for a stepwise snts analysis to identify tps while simultaneously performing quantitative target analysis the tp identification results were subjected to parameter estimations and predictions for hydrophobicity biodegradability and toxicity the transformation index which is a ratio of chromatographic area of the tp to the parent compound was used as an indirect estimation for the significance of transformation the calculated risk quotient rq was compared between the inlet and outlet of the wetland these predictions and assessments comprehensively assessed the value of the upo wetland as a treatment system of socs stemming from agricultural use 2 material and methods 2 1 characteristics of upo wetland the upo wetland is spread over 2 13 km2 upo 1 28 km2 mokpo 0 53 km2 sajipo 0 36 km2 and jjokji beol 0 13 km2 topyeongcheon is a stream running mainly through the upper part of upo which is divided into two parts by a natural levee fig 1 and it occasionally flows over the levee toward the lower part during flood events the stream transports contaminants from the surrounding area into the wetlands in addition there are three minor streams as input sources the pyeongjicheon flows into sajipo whereas the other two are upstream of mokpo m1 nameless small stream m2 chogokcheon the inlets of topyeong u2 sajipo u1 and mokpo m6 serve as hydraulic inlets of upo according to land use data ministry of environment 2019 most of the wetland watershed about 37 3 km2 is used as agricultural land fig 1 in particular allium crops e g onion and garlic are intensively cultivated in about 20 8 km2 or 55 8 of the total catchment area 2 2 sampling and pretreatment five sampling campaigns were conducted from march 2018 to march 2019 with at least 10 spatial sampling points fig 1 grab samples were collected in 1 l amber bottles with minimal headspace collected samples were transferred to the laboratory and stored at 4 c until analysis in order to enrich the sample a solid phase extraction spe method was used with self packed multi layer cartridges by four sorbents oasis hlb isolute env and strata xcw xaw kern et al 2009 a detailed explanation about the sampling campaign and sample preparation is summarized in the supporting information si sampling and pretreatment si a 1 2 3 instrumental setup instrument analysis was carried out using a liquid chromatography hrms based on the method described previously park et al 2018 an ultimate 3000 ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography and a q exactive plus quadrupole orbitrap mass spectrometry thermo fisher scientific waltham usa with electrospray interface esi were used data dependent acquisition dda mode was applied to obtain the ms ms fragments that were used for structure confirmation and elucidation detailed information about instrumental analysis is listed in table si a 2 2 4 identification and quantification of major pollutants target and suspect screening methods were performed to identify major pollutants in the wetlands tracefinder 4 1 thermo fisher scientific usa was used to quantify 30 target compounds table si a 6 target lists were established for compounds that were detected in previous screening and to determine if their own internal standards istd were available kang and jeon 2018 all of targets were quantified with the internal standard method all chemicals that were used are listed in table si a 5 the calibration curves were constructed with 14 points ranging from 0 1 to 2 000 ng l parallel with target screening suspect screening was conducted with the help of tracefinder 4 1 and xcalibur software thermo fisher scientific usa an in house suspect library was established through a literature survey including the pesticides that are expected to remain and persist namely environmental pesticide residues from the report of national institute of agricultural sciences of korea the swisspest list from the norman suspect list exchange and pharmaceuticals that were detected frequently in korean surface waters details in si b the list includes 347 parent compounds plus tps suspected as being used at high concentrations and or persistent in the wetland and its surrounding area the identifications for suspect compounds were preferentially done for samples collected in march september and november of 2018 n 50 identified suspect compounds were subjected to the confirmation process if relevant standards were available among the confirmed quantifiable substances were integrated into the existing target list the quantitative evaluations for the previous samples were then repeated with the integrated target list and the rebuilt calibration curves accordingly the next samples collected in january and march of 2019 n 30 were analyzed with the integrated quantification method one way anova was used to determine the significant differences between each compounds and sampling periods an anova test with 95 confidence was used and significance is defined by p 0 05 more detail information about identification and quantification sequence is described in si a compounds with an average concentration greater than 20 ng l were selected as major contaminants in the wetland 2 5 two step analysis approach for identification of tps in a previous study we identified azole fungicides e g tebuconazole tricyclazole as major contaminants in upo kang and jeon 2018 based on the results information on their tps were collected from literature survey for more identifications we applied a two step analysis approach i e 1st analysis for target measurement along with suspect and non target screening snts and 2nd suspect screening more details provided in fig 2 to establish the 1st suspect list a literature review was done si b 2 an in house tp suspect list was complied with 624 tps containing information on the compound name exact mass and structure formula furthermore candidates i e vulnerable structures that are easily subject to further transformation for the 2nd suspect list was established mainly with analogue structures or precursors descendants of identified tps si b 3 2 6 estimation assessment and prediction for transformation products the transformation index ti is the relative ratio of the tp chromatogram area to the parent compound area even though the peak area ratio does not necessarily indicate a relative concentration because of differences in ionization efficiency between tps and their parent compound the ratio reflects the significance of the transformation for the entire degradation process and the transformation magnitude of the original parent form although the authentic quantification for tps was not feasible due to the lack of reference standard an indirect estimation using chromatographic peak area has been suggested elsewhere to evaluate the significance masbou et al 2018 the ti was calculated as follows transformation index ti chromatogram peak area of tps chromatogram peak area of the parent by comparing the ratio of the peak areas the differences in the extent of transformation between substances and the increase decrease patterns in the transformation can be explained to assess the favorable changes of eco toxicological risk the pnec predicted non effect concentration value for rq method was determined using the ecotox database https cfpub epa gov ecotox usepa the rq was determined as following equation rq mec measured environmental concentration pnec predicted non effect concentration the rq level of concern was set to 1 0 thus sum of rq for all measured compounds above 1 would indicate a potential risk at the site the hydrophobicity logdow https chemicalize com and biodegradability were estimated using prediction tools biowin usepa more details about estimation and prediction are provided in the si estimation assessment and prediction for tps si a 3 results and discussion 3 1 major pollutants the quantitative analysis detected 25 out of 30 target compounds the original target list table si a 6 at least once in any of the 80 samples ten compounds 7 parent compounds 3 tps were identified by snts and then included in the original target list hence from the 1st suspect screening 9 pesticides boscalid dimethenamid dimethoate ethoprophos fluopyram fluxapyroxad metconazole orysastrobin and propiconazole were additionally identified and then confirmed by reference standards except for dimethoate no available standard among the confirmed 7 pesticides dimethenamid ethoprophos fluopyram fluxapyroxad metconazole orysastrobin and propiconazole were subject to quantification analysis afterwards of the tps identified by the 1st suspect screening 7 tps 2 aminobenzimidazole 2 hydroxybenzimidazole 2 isopropyl 6 methyl 4 pyrimidinol 2 aminobenzothiazole teb m324a teb m324d and thiacloprid amide were confirmed but only 3 tps 2 aminobenzimidazole teb m324a teb m324d were quantified the calibration curve was established for 14 points 0 1 0 5 1 2 5 10 20 50 70 100 200 500 1 000 2 000 ng l and the linearity of the calibration curve for 40 targets 30 compounds the original target list 10 compounds identified by snts exceeded an r2 value of 0 99 the limit of detection was lower than 0 5 ng l for all compounds and limit of quantification ranged from 0 5 to 5 0 ng l table si a 7 the calculated coefficient of variance was less than 25 for all compounds the absolute recovery rates were approximately 75 to 125 except fluoxetine and prometryn which were 72 and 63 respectively fig si a 2 of those quantified 30 compounds 85 were detected above a 50 detection frequency these substances were prioritized based on their average concentration fig 3 among them pesticides accounted for 83 in the composition ratio fungicides had the highest ratio of 42 the composition of each class of compounds with an average concentration above 20 ng l defined as major pollutants shows that pesticides were dominant 89 particularly fungicides 47 as shown in fig 3 orysastrobin was detected at the highest average concentration 740 380 ng l followed by carbendazim 270 370 ng l and tricyclazole 210 690 ng l orysastrobin is commonly used in combination with azole fungicides e g tricyclazole for crop cultivations as tricyclazole tebuconazole and propiconazole showed relatively high concentrations 210 ng l 120 ng l and 50 ng l respectively azoles trios are likely dominant agents to control fungal growth on allium in the region in addition dimethenamid 110 410 ng l is used to control garlic pests since most of the major pollutants are components of pesticides related to the cultivation of allium crops there is no doubt that the contamination of the upo wetland is greatly impacted by the cultivation of allium crops by the adjacent agriculture to determine the seasonal pattern of pesticides in the upo wetland the cumulative concentrations in different subgroups as a function of the season are shown in fig si a 3 the cumulative concentration of fungicides was higher than other subcategories for all seasons sampled fungicides were detected at the highest concentrations in november and march this is related to the seasonal agricultural activities in korea allium crops are in general sown at the end of october with a wide usage of pesticides in march pesticides are sprayed to prevent diseases once again before the spring season two azole fungicides tebuconazole p 0 05 tricyclazole p 0 05 showed significant differences with seasons on the contrary orysastrobin an emerging pesticide basf 2009 with little information but limited to hydrolysis half life dt50 of 365d showed no seasonal differences p 0 05 with the monthly average concentrations ranged from 690 to 890 ng l fig si a 3 in the case of insecticides a u shaped pattern was observed fig si a 3 two major insecticides ethoprophos and carbofuran have been applied in different seasons national institute of agricultural sciences 2019 ethoprophos is sprayed pre sowing while carbofuran is mainly sprayed before the spring season the spatial distribution pattern of the pollutants was discussed in section 3 4 among the major pollutants detected tebuconazole exceeded the limit of the european union drinking water directive 98 83 ec 100 ng l showing similar levels to those of wwtp influents and effluents stamatis et al 2010 westlund and yargeau 2017 the use of tricyclazole for plant protection has recently been revoked in the commission regulation eu 2017 983 ispra 2018 these two azoles are persistent in aqueous systems and also frequently detected in european surface waters mascolo et al 2019 the organophosphate insecticide ethoprophos 120 430 ng l is also banned under ec regulation 1107 2009 91 414 eec another major insecticide in the wetland was deet n n diethyl 3 methylbenzamide with a mean concentration of 27 36 ng l this ache inhibitor has been frequently detected in domestic surface waters yoon et al 2010 including treated u s drinking water stackelberg et al 2004 in our study deet was also observed to have a high detection frequency of 98 prochloraz is applied to various crops but it is often mixed with pesticides for garlic pest prevention with tebuconazole prochloraz showed a lower detection frequency of 18 it is expected to be actively degraded in a wetland system because of its short half life dt50 1 3 6 4 d efsa 2015a we identified one tp prz m325 as evidence of its degradation some neonicotinoids imidacloprid thiacloprid and acetamiprid recently specified as eu watch list compounds eu decision 2018 840 2018 were frequently detected from 67 to 94 imidacloprid and thiacloprid exceeded the chronic environmental quality standard eqs up to 5 1 fold imidacloprid eqs 13 ng l and 2 1 fold thiacloprid eqs 10 ng l respectively the quantification results include the concentrations of 3 tps teb m324a teb m324d and 2 aminobenzimidazole at levels relatively lower than their parents fig 3 2 aminobenzimidazole is a representative tp of carbendazim but would rapidly transform to another form tp e g 2 hydroxybenzimidazole by further transform reaction such as hydroxylation boudina et al 2003 along with pesticides and their tps other micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals were also quantified the detection of caffeine provides supporting evidence that the wetland is a sink for treated municipal wastewater the presence of the veterinary antibiotic sulfamethoxazole implies that contamination is occurring from nearby livestock farms since benzotriazole is widely used as anticorrosive agent in both industrial and municipal applications the exact possible point sources cannot be identified detailed measured concentrations including the nearest surface water samples nakdong river nd1 and nd2 are listed in si a 8 to 12 3 2 identification of tps the tp identification with 1st suspect screening and non target screening 1st step analysis approach was done following the workflow described in fig 2 thirty tps were tentatively identified from the 1st suspect screening subsequent non target screening identified 9 other tps the following 2nd suspect screening identified 9 tps resulting in a total of 48 tps tentatively identified table 1 these 48 tps originated from 14 parent pesticides classified with the confidence level identification detailed previously schymanski et al 2014 among these 7 tps were confirmed while 35 tps still had higher confidence levels level 2 for 23 level 3 for 12 fig si a 9 to 25 fig si a 28 to 44 fig si a 46 47 a description of the structure of the identified tp is shown in table si a 14 six tps were level 4 due to no sufficient structural ms ms data found fig si a 26 27 and 45 in the following sub sections detailed identification information is further described with a focus on two major substances with the most abundant numbers of distinct tps detected tebuconazole had 16 tricyclazole had 7 3 2 1 tebuconazole a total of 16 tebuconazole tps were separated using lc hrms and their structure was identified by accurate ms ms data tebuconazole had the highest numbers of tps in wetland samples and all tps shared triazole ring fragment m z 70 0400 a key ms ms feature of the structural elucidation it is consistent with previous tp identifications with the identical fragment mercadante et al 2014 many previous studies on tp identification have been done for tebuconazole fundamentally main degradation transformation mechanism of tebuconazole are hydroxylation oxidation and dechlorination stamatis et al 2015 at m z 324 1423 4 isomer tps i e teb m324a d were detected indicating hydroxylation or oxidation had occurred at diverse molecular bonds these isomers have been reported in invertebrate metabolisms soil rösch et al 2017 2016 storck et al 2016a and in humans mercadante et al 2014 two products teb m324a and teb m324d were confirmed with reference standards during the 1st suspect screening teb m324d was not positive due to a low peak intensity 1 105 however it was positive in a manual evaluation procedure since the peak had a normal shape and the corresponding ms ms included a diagnostic fragment m z 141 0101 teb m324c was distinguished with a unique fragment m z 97 1013 in comparison with available databases et250501 mona fig si a 31 this fragment was not detected for any other peaks those oxidation tps were measured with different retention times depending on the attachment position of oxygen suggesting that isoform tps exhibit different bioaccumulative tendencies teb m224 one of a major tebuconazole tps showed the highest peak area among tebuconazole tps up to 2 2 108 this result is consistent with a former soil study potter et al 2005 that showed the tp concentration was 8 times greater than tebuconazole it had two diagnostic fragments m z 70 0400 99 0441 strickland et al 2004 which are conclusive evidence for triazole and lactone rings fig si a 35 teb m274 with m z 274 1911 and empirical formula c16h24n3o formed with dechlorination from tebuconazole the biotic dechlorination of tebuconazole in the natural environment has rarely been reported rösch et al 2017 2016 storck et al 2016b though one study has shown that the dechlorination can take a place catalytically stamatis et al 2015 hence the detection of teb m274 supports the hypothesis that organisms in wetlands serve as biocatalysts rapidly accelerating the degradation of tebuconazole 3 2 2 tricyclazole fig si a 1 shows examples of tps identified from tricyclazole for tri m206a several diagnostic ms ms fragments and neutral losses were evident a fragment at m z 188 0272 implied dehydration from the precursor fig si a 1 some neutral mass losses were identified with m z 161 0169 and 134 0059 indicating the cleavage of triazole several fragments such as m z 161 0169 151 0323 134 0059 and 124 0218 indicate that tri m206a has a thiazole ring fig si a 42 the formation of an alcohol moiety was expected to increase hydrophilicity relative to the parent compound and the calculated logdow also showed a lower value 0 1 1 7 tricyclazole by one magnitude order due to the wide detection of tri m206a the framework under directive 91 414 eec investigated the stability of tri m206a concluding it would be stable at temperatures less than or equal to 18 c for up to 6 months in rice efsa 2013 the alcohol moiety would be easily transformed to carboxylic acid which was confirmed in the present study through the identification of tri m220 the carboxylic form was not suspected as a candidate and thus identified via non target screening with strong evidence i e diagnostic ms ms neutral mass loss as described in fig si a 41 products with carboxylic acid have been rarely detected in environmental samples possibly because such highly hydrophilic substances show in general a low spe recovery in the enrichment step for those hydrophilies we used env and ion exchangers that are specialized for the enrichment of hydrophilic and or ionizable compounds aside the abundant oxygen in the wetland system mean do value 9 7 mg l would accelerate the oxidation of tri m206a forming carboxylated tp tri m220 sulfuric acid forms such as tri m240 and tri m238 were also detected fig si a 39 40 tri m238 has been detected in soil and even groundwater efsa 2015b whereas tri m240 was reported in blue green algae wu et al 2018 the estimated logdow for tri m240 1 8 suggests the high possibility of occurrence in surface and ground waters kiefer et al 2019 3 3 degradation pathways of major pollutants a transformation pathway in the wetland system is proposed for tebuconazole tricyclazole and deet all which produced at least three tps above confidence level 3 fig 4 and fig si a 4 5 fig 4 shows the proposed oxidative transformation pathway based on the 16 tps identified for tebuconazole the dominant reactions are hydroxylation and demethylation the hydroxylation tps e g teb m324a d and teb m290 are formed with the replacement of h by oh the hydroxylation of tebuconazole has been reported for various media and organisms jeon et al 2013a 2013b jeon and hollender 2019 rösch et al 2016 benzene ring opening which can occur from oxidation and hydroxylation reactions obanda et al 2008 obanda and shupe 2009 has been reported as for a microbial biotransformation in an open wetland system svan et al 2016 yin et al 2019 the phenyl residues of tebuconazole are more fragile to degradation than 1 2 4 triazole moiety storck et al 2016a strickland et al 2004 which is consistent with our results on the modification of chloro phenyl after dechlorination teb m274 was further transformed to sub tps via ring opening and demethylation teb m224 showed the most abundant peak intensity among tebuconazole tps in our study there is no certainty that teb m224 is the final product we identified teb m242 as evidence of the teb m224 variant with a γ hydroxy butyric acid moiety that can be transformed to γ lactone depending on ph conditions el et al 2018 storck et al 2016a for the formation of γ lactone further nucleophilic reaction occurred with internal dehydration fig 4 tricyclazole a three ring species showed 7 tps with various ring modifications fig si a 4 tricyclazole transformed into the alcohol form of tri m206a through a hydroxylation reaction at the methyl moiety tri m206a was also transformed to a carboxyl acid form tri m220 the formation of tri m206a and tri m220 have been reported in studies with blue green algae and rice and they have a similar persistence as the parent compound efsa 2015b n kumar et al 2017 the breakdown of thiazole ring of tricyclazole was also observed forming tri m240 tri m238 and tri m206b showing dissociation of s c bond notably tri m206b an intermediate tp toward tri m238 from tricyclazole has not been detected in the environment and it has only been identified in a study of isotope labeled tricyclazole biosynthesis balcer et al 2011 tps formed with the cleavage of s c bond i e tri m240 and m238 are of concerns due to the persistency in the environment which is comparable to the parent efsa 2015b tri m165 is the only tp formed from the cleavage of 1 2 4 triazole in our study the 1 2 4 triazole form is recalcitrant in the environment and its transformation is reported only under optimized conditions with sphingomonas wu et al 2018 2016 after the ring cleavage decyanation of other rings a hydration reaction and the final mineralization reaction would follow wu et al 2018 we propose a deet transformation pathway in the wetland fig si a 5 including 3 tps formed via amide n deethylation deet m164 deet m136 and hydroxylation deet m137 deet m164 and deet m136 are known to be unstable and thus quickly disappeared within several days in a bioreactor helbling et al 2010 in our study the deet m136 peak disappeared at the downstream sampling point u5 this suggests that deet was converted to more biodegradable forms that would be harder to detect however these would presumably be easier to degrade as well 3 4 evaluation of degradation capacity with transformation index to evaluate the extent to which upo wetland contributes to the degradation of socs the concentrations of major socs at the inlets m1 m2 u1 and u2 and outlet u5 were directly compared each input is well controlled by the hydrologic gates at the inlet points the flow rate is slow and steady state unless flooding occurs kim et al 2019 table 2 lists the concentrations of five major pollutants detected in november 2018 when the cumulative concentration of all compounds was the highest all of the pollutant concentrations were higher at the inlet points than the outlet point u5 for example orysastrobin was introduced at the m1 and m2 inlets with the highest concentration of 2 400 ng l and 1 500 ng l respectively however at the u5 outlet the concentration was 470 ng l demonstrating a dramatic decrease by above 70 of the input concentrations it is a notable decrease considering that orysastrobin is persistent in water and moderately mobile in soil koc 18 150 ml g the decrease can be attributable to numerous elimination mechanisms including sorption evaporation hydrolysis biodegradation etc nevertheless there is strong evidence that pesticide degradation occurs throughout the wetland because of occurrence of two tps ory m408 and ory m365 similar decreasing trends were observed for dimethenamid tebuconazole carbendazim and metalaxyl but to different extents table 2 for estimating the removal amount of socs recorded flow rates in upo were used whenever available for the last decade kim et al 2008 because the exact hydraulic mass balance of upo could not be calculated due to various reasons e g long hydraulic retention time significant amount of water evaporation often usage of water for irrigation an estimation was made using the flow rate data the flow rate information was obtained only for m6 u1 u2 and u5 points table si a 15 and used to calculate the input output mass loads of pollutants as shown in table 2 the estimate indicates that the major socs were removed at least 80 at the outlet heading into the nakdong river interestingly the removal rates for carbendazim and tebuconazole are even higher than ones reported in a conventional wwtp table 2 fig 5 summarizes the tis for tebuconazole and prochloraz and their tps for the parent compounds the highest peak area was measured at the inlets the ti of tebuconazole increased gradually along the streams up to three times higher compared to the inlet point suggesting that the degradation of tebuconazole occurred in the wetland teb m224 is the major tebuconazole tp with the highest area portion among all tebuconazole tps the proportion increased slightly from 31 of inlet to 42 in the outlet in contrast teb m274 with dechlorination recorded 3 of area proportion with tebuconazole in outlet with one magnitude order higher than inlets 0 2 for prochloraz a marked ti increase was also observed in the outlet although it fluctuated in the middle of mokpo compared to the nakdong river nd1 nd2 the receiving water of the upo wetland the ti values for tebuconazole and prochloraz in the wetland were higher tebuconazole 0 4 2 8 of m6 prochloraz 3 2 8 7 of u5 suggesting that wetland can transform pesticides to tps 3 5 potential risk and mitigation to estimate the potential harms of pollutants to organisms at occurring concentration levels a risk assessment was conducted using rq calculations as illustrated in fig si a 6 the inlet points such as u1 u2 m1 and m2 at november 2018 had an rq above 1 whereas the outlet point u5 was lower risk with an rq less than 1 and as low as 0 4 this decreased rq at outlet demonstrated that upo wetland mitigates eco toxicological potential by elimination of active parent substances the formation of diverse tps is a critical elimination mechanism the tps may have different physicochemical characteristics from the parent compound sinclair and boxall 2003 the differences inevitably result in the distinctions in environmental fates that can be estimated with parameters such as hydrophobicity and biodegradability qsar based estimates for those parameters biowin usepa are shown in fig 6 and fig si a 7 for reliable estimations only tps with a distinct molecular structure above confidence level 3 were computed into the model hydrophobicity was estimated with a logdow value at ph of 7 4 which is a representative ph in the upo mean value of ph 8 5 table si a 1 in case of tebuconazole the logdow was 3 7 suggesting its high bioaccumulative ability however most tebuconazole tps showed lower logdow values than the parent indicating reduced bioaccumulation and thus less risky fig 6 a the shorter retention time in chromatography of tps is further evidence for the lower hydrophobicity table 2 the environmental significance of tps was estimated by comparing the relative biodegradability over the parent compound using in silico qsar models fig 6 b and fig si a 7 all compounds were classified either as readily degradable probability 0 5 or not readily degradable probability 0 5 both qsar models resulted in a value 0 0028 for tebuconazole indicating its low biodegradability according to biowin results with the exception of tec m324c the biodegradability for all of tebuconazole tps increased even though they are classified as not readily degradable by model the enhanced biodegradability for tps suggests that the wetland can transform recalcitrant substances to tps with increased degradability the toxicity estimations conducted with the ecosar model for most of identified tps are shown in fig 6 c only one tp teb m306 showed greater toxicity than tebuconazole for daphnia and fish the moieties that contributed the most to the toxicity of teb m306 were 1 2 4 triazole and the c c double bond near the alcohol moiety allyl group schultz and yarbrough 2004 the carbendazim tps 2 aminobenzimidazole and 2 hydroxybenzimidazole are phytotoxic due to their unhindered aniline bai et al 2017 but less so than the parent compound carbendazim gatidou and iatrou 2011 panda et al 2018 further these tps are expected to degrade faster than carbendazim as observed in an alkaline wetland ph 8 5 boudina et al 2003 4 conclusions the novel screening approach used in this study with the stepwise suspect non target screening extended the knowledge on socs present in the upo wetland and provided new information about their degradation fates in natural wetlands suspect non target identifications of unrecognized contaminants including diverse tps were observed some of which were then integrated into the final target list the integrated target analysis quantified 30 out of 40 targets mostly consisting of pesticides the quantification results found fungicides as the major socs in the wetland accounting for about 50 of the total quantified orysastrobin occurred at the highest mean concentration 700 ng l followed by two other fungicides carbendazim and tricyclazole these fungicides are known to be intensively used for garlics and onions which are representative crops in the region insecticides and herbicides also accounted for a significant portion 34 of the total quantified nevertheless the socs showed a notable decrease in concentration between the inlet and the outlet u5 of the wetland leading to lower rqs with a high density in house suspect list comprising approximately 970 pesticides and tps combined with the 2 step suspect screening we identified 48 pesticide tps seven tps were finally confirmed with reference

17487,fe iii loaded chitosan cts fe composite was used for the first time to remove and recover phosphorus p from waste activated sludge was via anaerobic digestion ad the p transformation pathway and the effect of cts fe addition on the ad process were investigated using batch experiments the p fractionation results indicate that non apatite inorganic phosphorus naip reduction in the solid phase of sludge at 20 g l of cts fe addition 6 72 mg g ss was 2 4 times higher than that in the control 2 77 mg g ss no cts fe addition this is probably brought about by the added cts fe enhanced the reduction of fe iii p compounds in the sludge with phosphate released into the liquid phase cts fe can efficiently recover 95 of p from the liquid digestate of was notably partial fe iii on the cts fe was reduced and effectively combined with p to form vivianite crystals on the cts fe surface during the ad process characterization analysis demonstrated that ligand exchange and chemical precipitation were the dominant mechanisms for p removal recovery furthermore the addition of cts fe increased methane production by 11 9 32 2 under the tested conditions likely attributable to the enhanced hydrolysis of was under cts fe supplementation as the p loaded cts fe particles can be easily separated and recovered from the ad system and further reutilized in agriculture this study could

wastewater treatment plants xps x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xrd x ray diffraction λ lag phase time d 1 introduction tremendous amounts of waste activated sludge was are generated in wastewater treatment plants wwtps as a main byproduct every year which is an arduous task for the solid waste management industry huang and tang 2015 in japan around 170 69 million tons of was were generated in 2017 accounting for about 44 5 of the total industrial waste moe 2020 however according to some reports only 35 of the was are well managed and the sludge treatment is estimated to occupy about half of the total operating costs of a wwtp luo et al 2018 zhao et al 2017 incineration landfill and reutilization as soil conditioner are the main traditional disposal methods for was tyagi and lo 2013 in fact was with a huge production volume contains high levels of nutrients nitrogen n and phosphorus p in addition to high water content huang and tang 2015 it has been reported that around 4 12 p can be concentrated in was when enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr and chemical phosphorus removal cpr techniques are applied in wwtps he et al 2016 xu et al 2015 thus was has been increasingly recognized as a potential and promising source for p recovery anaerobic digestion ad has been proposed as the most attractive method to compete against the above mentioned incineration and landfilling for was treatment due to its capacity for simultaneous bioenergy production and resources recovery volatile fatty acids vfas or methane cao et al 2019 li et al 2018 however the ad process can result in a large amount of phosphate release into the liquid phase of digestate cheng et al 2017 which should be paid much attention when taking the efficient subsequent treatment and resources recovery into consideration that is additional treatment process for the liquid digestate is required before being processed which is also one of the major issues for the sustainable management of ad systems in this context several technologies have been employed to recover p from the liquid digestate in which crystallization has been extensively researched through coupling hydrothermal pretreatment with crystallization of magnesium ammonium phosphate map or struvite rahaman et al 2014 simulated the removal and recovery of p from the liquid digestate via struvite crystallization in a fluidized bed reactor on the other hand recently p recovery from was as vivianite has gained more attention due to its higher p recovery efficiency and economic value wilfert et al 2018 wu et al 2019 for instance cao et al 2019 obtained about 82 60 of total p tp recovered as vivianite during ad of was under optimal fecl3 dosage and ph condition although these techniques are valid they have limited practical applications mainly owing to the following disadvantages 1 complex operating conditions 2 low p recovery efficiency from liquid digestate while with high residual p in the solid sludge 3 high operating costs due to chemical reagents addition and 4 difficulty in direct separation and purification of phosphate precipitate from the treated was egle et al 2016 hao et al 2013 li et al 2019a wang et al 2019 wilfert et al 2018 wu et al 2019 consequently it is still highly demanded to develop more efficient and environment friendly methods for p recovery from the liquid digestate of was prior to its further treatment by the subsequent processes on the other hand low methane yield and sludge reduction rate to some extent limit the application of ad in was treatment zhang et al 2014 as it is known ad is generally proceeded in the following sequential three steps namely hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis among the above three steps hydrolysis is regarded as the rate limiting step of ad of was because microbial cell walls in sludge are resistant to be decomposed peng et al 2018 as noted the slow electron exchange rate among anaerobes might be the main reason for the low efficiency of methanogenesis stage during ad yang et al 2017 therefore development of a new technology for simultaneous p recovery with enhanced methane production is of vast significance for ad of was as an inexpensive and environmentally friendly carbon based material granular chitosan fe iii complex cts fe with higher p adsorption capacity 15 7 mg p g than other existing adsrbents has been successfully developed and employed to adsorb phosphate from wastewater zhang et al 2018 notably previous studies have found that fe iii could be reduced as fe ii by dissimilatory metal reducing bacteria dmrb under anaerobic condition o loughlin et al 2013 rothe et al 2016 which may further combine with phosphate to form vivianite thus fe on the surface of the cts fe composite may have the ability to improve p recovery during ad of was furthermore results from previous studies hao et al 2017 peng et al 2018 yang et al 2017 zhao et al 2018 indicate that conductive carbon based materials or fe iii can accelerate direct interspecies electron transfer diet and enhance hydrolysis during ad of was resulting in improved methane production up to now however little information is available on the effect of cts fe composites on methane production and p recovery from was during ad this study attempted for the first time to simultaneously recover p and enhance methane production from was by adding the fe loaded chitosan complex cts fe specifically the objectives of this study were to 1 investigate the feasibility of cts fe for p recovery as vivianite from was via ad 2 evaluate the efficacy of cts fe addition on methane production from was and 3 reveal the mechanisms involved in p transformation and pathways during ad of was in the presence of cts fe 2 materials and methods 2 1 material synthesis and preparation cts powder 27 g was first dissolved in 900 ml of 2 v v acetic acid and then fecl3 6h2o 0 1 m was added to the solution the solution was continuously stirred for 4 h and then the mixed solution was added dropwise into an ammonia solution 6 25 v v with a syringe after standing for 1 h the obtained gel beads were thoroughly washed with deionized water and dried at 50 c for 24 h in this study was and digested sludge which represent the substrate and inoculum respectively were collected from a domestic wwtp in ibaraki prefecture japan and stored at 4 c before use the main characteristics of the was and digested sludge are shown in table 1 2 2 batch ad experiments an 80 ml mixture which contained was substrate and digested sludge inoculum at a ratio of 8 2 v v was incubated in a 100 ml digestion bottle to investigate the effects of different cts fe dosage on the ad of was four test groups containing 0 5 10 and 20 g l cts fe with initial sludge vs ts 0 77 were operated in parallel and marked as rc r1 r2 and r3 respectively before digestion the initial ph was adjusted to 7 2 using 0 1 m hcl or 0 1 m naoh next the bottles were sealed with rubber stoppers and flushed with nitrogen gas for 3 min and then incubated at 38 2 c for 30 days at the end of batch ad experiments the granular cts fe composites were completely separated from the sludge through an 32 mesh sieve 0 5 mm the obtained granular cts fe composite was washed with deionized water and dried at 50 c for 24 h and then stored in enclosed plastic bags for subsequent analysis 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 general indices total solids ts and volatile solids vs contents in the sludge samples were determined according to the standard methods apha 2012 biogas was collected using a gas tight 60 ml syringe every two days and the methane content in biogas was analyzed by gas chromatography gc 8a shimadzu japan volatile fatty acids vfas were quantified by another gas chromatography gc 14b shimadzu japan ph was determined with a ph meter fe20 mettler toledo switzerland 2 3 2 characterization methods in this study the cts fe samples used for characterization were obtained from r2 10 g l cts fe before and after ad the morphology and elemental composition of the cts fe and the crystals on cts fe surface were analyzed by the scanning electron microscopy sem coupled with energy dispersion spectroscopy sem eds ssx 550 shimadzu japan while the crystallized phase of the cts fe after ad was analyzed by x ray diffraction xrd d8 focus bruker germany fourier transform infrared spectrometery ftir vertex 70v bruker germany and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps escalab250xi thermo fisher usa were used to determine the functional groups and their binding states in cts fe the detailed operation conditions for sem eds xrd ftir and xps are described in the supplementary data table s1 2 3 3 p fractionation in solid sludge by smt protocol in this study the standards measurements and testing smt extraction protocol was applied to analyze p fractions garcía albacete et al 2012 the detailed procedure is presented in the supplementary data fig s1 p in the solid phase of sludge can sequentially be determined in five categories total phosphorus tp inorganic p ip organic p op non apatite inorganic p naip associated with fe al and mn and apatite p ap ca bound the naip and op are generally deemed as bioavailable p as they can be potentially utilized by microorganisms and plants the extracted p and phosphate in the liquid phase were measured using the molybdenum blue method apha 2012 with a uv visible spectrophotometer uv 1800 shimadzu japan 2 4 kinetics analysis to quantitatively analyze the effect of cts fe addition on methane production during ad of was the experimental data from the batch test was fitted to the modified gompertz equation lay et al 1999 1 p p max exp exp r max e p max λ t 1 where p is the observed cumulative methane yield ml g vs pmax is

analysis all experiments were conducted in triplicate the data presented in the results and discussion are average values for data analysis one way analysis of variance anova was applied to analyze statistical difference in the experimental data using microsoft office excel 2016 the xps and xrd results were analyzed by xpspeak 4 1 and mdi jade 9 0 respectively origin 9 0 was used to fit the kinetic model 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect on methane production the effects of cts fe addition on cumulative methane yield and daily methane production from was are illustrated in figs 1 a and b respectively as shown in fig 1a methane production was significantly increased under cts fe addition condition the accumulative methane yields at cts fe dosage of 5 0 10 0 and 20 g l were 209 9 236 6 and 247 9 ml g vs respectively about 12 26 and 32 higher than the control without cts fe addition 187 5 ml g vs much higher daily methane production peak 44 1 ml g vs d was detected on day 12 in r3 20 g l cts fe compared with that in rc 31 2 ml g vs d on day 20 fig 1b in order to make clear the effect of cts fe on methane production from was of ad the relevant parameters obtained by fitting the experimental data to the modified gompertz model are shown in table 2 the correlation coefficients r2 0 994 0 998 suggest the goodness of the gompertz models fitting to the experimental data and the predicted results were almost consistent with the experimental results compared to the control rc the reactors with cts fe addition r1 r2 and r3 showed relatively higher methane production the methane production potential pmax and the maximum methane production rate rmax increased with the increase in cts fe dosage with the maximum increase in pmax 24 observed at 20 g l of cts fe addition the rmax was increased by 13 33 under the addition of cts fe in addition the lag time for methane production was shortened by 40 when 20 g l of cts fe was supplemented these results indicate that cts fe addition could significantly enhance the methane production from ad of was the enhanced methane production was probably ascribed to the promoted anaerobic hydrolysis acidification of complex matters in was by fe iii on the surface of cts fe beneficial for methanogenesis and organics mineralization zhang et al 2014 besides cts fe as the carbon based material may be able to stimulate diet to boost electron transfer between the substrates and microbes lin et al 2017 3 2 effect on vfas evolution the variation of vfas during the ad process is shown in fig s2 acetic and propionic acids are the two main constituents accounting for 31 5 and 19 5 of the total vfas 468 9 mg cod l respectively in the raw was in the reactors with cts fe addition the maximum vfas concentrations of 2239 8 mg cod l 5 g l 2328 5 mg cod l 10 g l and 2494 2 mg cod l 20 g l were respectively detected in r1 r3 on day 3 in contrast a lower maximum vfas concentration in the control 2144 1 mg cod l was noticed on day 6 the concentrations of vfas however declined rapidly thereafter in all the reactors attributable to the consumption by methanogens this observation is in accordance with the methane production trend moreover as shown in table s2 the vs reductions in the cts fe reactors were increased by about 1 04 1 22 times that in the control 27 4 meng et al 2013 demonstrated that the enhancement of organic matter reduction was related to the improved activity of hydrolytic enzymes under the addition of fe0 the observation in this study suggests that cts fe may promote the hydrolysis of was with improved vs reduction and vfas production during the ad process moreover the concentrations of propionic acid in the cts fe reactors were detected to decrease faster than in the control indicating that cts fe may promote the decomposition of propionate this result is consistent with zhang et al 2014 who observed that the rusty scrap improved the conversion of propionate in ad of was 3 3 changes in p fractionation during ad in order to investigate the distribution and migration of p in was during the ad process this study used the smt protocol to extract p fractions in the solid phase and determined the proportions of p in the solid and liquid phases as shown in table 3 most of the p 66 3 in the raw was were distributed in the solid phase in which op occupied 4 0 of tp and maintained at 1 83 0 03 mg g ss fig 2 b during the whole ad process from the analysis of p mass balance the p concentration in the liquid phase of was in rc increased by 39 5 at the end of digestion with a corresponding p reduction in the solid phase it has previously been reported that this decrease may be brought about by the decomposition of extracellular polymeric substances eps that release p containing organic matter which can be then hydrolyzed into ortho p chen et al 2019 monea et al 2020 compared with rc the increase in p concentration in the liquid phase of was was not detected in the cts fe added reactors fig 2a and table 3 in which the tp in the liquid digestate decreased from 371 81 to 17 58 mg p l at the end of experiment under the addition of 20 g l of cts fe r3 this confirms that cts fe could effectively adsorb phosphate from the liquid digestate of was it was noteworthy that the content of op solid phase of the sludge slightly increased when the cts fe dosage was increased from 5 g l r1 to 10 g l r2 possibly due to the increased number of microorganisms such as acidogenic bacteria and sulfate reducing bacteria srb yang et al 2019 which needs further investigation on the other hand ip in solid dominated the raw was 94 2 of tp in the solid of sludge with naip and ap amounting to 73 5 and 26 5 of the ip respectively fig 2b during the ad process the naip and ap contents in the solid phase in the cts fe added reactors decreased with the increase in cts fe dosage which notably decreased from 21 54 to 14 82 mg g ss and 7 76 to 3 68 mg g ss at 20 g l of cts fe respectively in contrast the naip and ap contents in the sludge slightly decreased by 2 77 and 1 50 mg g ss in rc respectively previous studies have shown that iron addition can increase the naip content in sludge during ad process li et al 2019b claimed that the naip in sludge with iron addition increased by 14 compared to the raw sludge however in this work the naip and ap contents in sludge in r3 20 g l of cts fe addition decreased by 31 2 and 52 6 after 30 days ad respectively this observation implies that the added cts fe may stimulate the transformation of ip in the solid phase of sludge and then release fe2 3 like ions into the liquid phase and the latter can further enhance the removal and recovery of phosphate from the liquid digestate during the ad process moreover naip and op which are generally regarded as potentially bioavailable p accounted for 75 3 of tp in the raw sludge results show that the bioavailable p was increased to 79 9 5 g l 81 8 10 g l and 82 0 20 g l in the three cts fe added reactors on day 30 respectively most probably attributable to the decreased tp content in the sludge with the increase of cts fe dosage under the test conditions p adsorption capacity of cst fe decreased from 91 43 mg g r1 to 59 98 mg g r2 and 36 15 mg g r3 much higher than its use for the treatment of synthetic phosphate containing wastewater 15 70 mg g 30 c zhang et al 2018 this observation is mainly due to much higher initial phosphate concentration 370 mg l and more complex composition of the liquid digestate involving more pathways to remove p in this study 3 4 characterization of cts fe 3 4 1 ftir to investigate the mechanisms of p removal and recovery the ftir spectra of cts fe before and after ad process were analyzed fig s3 the bands at 1657 and 1594 cm 1 can be assigned to acetylated amino group nh2 on cts the characteristic peak at 1594 cm 1 almost disappeared after ad meaning that amino might be partially substituted furthermore a new peak appeared at 1325 cm 1 c n stretching of amide iii after ad ntohogian et al 2018 the absorption bands at 1157 and 1028 cm 1 correspond to asymmetric stretching of c o c bridge and hydroxyl group ch2 oh stretching which was weakened after ad barbosa et al 2019 the absorption bands at 896 661 and 419 cm 1 are related to metal oxygen fe o bonds in the complexes cornell and schwertmann 2003 deng et al 2016 tofik et al 2016 it is obviously seen that the adsorption bands shifted from 661 to 562 cm 1 and weakened at 896 and 419 cm 1 after ad moreover the band at 1070 cm 1 associated with the asymmetry vibration of sorbed po4 3 li et al 2014 tofik et al 2016 increased in intensity after ad all the above results suggest that the stretching bands of fe o were involved in p adsorption on the surface of cst fe 3 4 2 xps xps is a useful tool to determine the material s surface functional groups to further explain the mechanisms involved in this work the xps spectra of the cts fe composites were analyzed the xps spectra of o n fe and p for the samples before and after ad are shown in fig 3 and the detailed fitting parameters are presented in table 4 the wide scan xps spectra of cts fe indicated the presence of o n fe and p elements fig 3a a new peak at the binding energy around 130 0 ev assigning to p 2p was clearly observed on cts fe after ad suggesting that phosphates were successfully adsorbed onto cts fe the spectrum of o 1s can be deconvoluted into three individual component peaks fig 3b the peaks well fit at 530 1 531 5 and 532 8 ev probably attributable to the oxygen bonded to metal m o the hydroxyl bonded to metal m oh and the bonded water h2o respectively zhang et al 2018 after the ad process the binding energies of the three peaks of o 1s shifted to 530 8 531 7 and 532 9 respectively the area ratio of the m oh peak decreased from 15 4 to 10 0 while the relative area of the m o peak increased significantly from 9 8 to 19 1 the variations of the binding energy and area ratio at m oh suggest that the iron hydrolysate on the surface of cst fe participated in ad during the phosphate adsorption process by ligand exchange as previously reported cts can interact with many transition metal ions through a chelation mechanism qu et al 2011 therefore the change in the m o peak might be associated with the combination of added metal and material itself during the ad process the n 1s spectrum of the pristine cts fe fig 3c well fits with the two peaks at 399 5 and 401 3 ev the first peak exhibits a greater intensity which is associated with the presence of non protonated nh2 or nh amino groups while the peak at 401 3 ev can be assigned to the presence of protonated amino groups nh3 de godoi et al 2013 a noticeable shift of 0 3 ev was observed in the characteristic peak for protonated species nh3 after the ad process the percentage of protonated species increased from 3 3 to 18 1 while the non protonated amino group species decreased by 14 8 this phenomenon can be ascribed to the protonation of amino groups on the surface of cst fe which may attract hydrogen ions in the solution de godoi et al 2013 additionally this observation also suggests that electrostatic attraction is not the dominant interaction for p recovery from was during the ad process to confirm that p was recovered after ad the p 2p spectra of the cts fe were analyzed one sharp peak was noticed in the p 2p spectrum after the ad process fig 3d this was decomposed into two main peaks located at 132 9 ev and 133 7 ev which can be ascribed to po4 3 and hpo4 2 respectively cui et al 2016 this result reflects that p was effectively combined with the cts fe complex during ad process with p containing mx po4 3 y and mx hpo4 2 y complexes being mainly formed in order to identify the chemical valence states of fe on the surface of the cts fe complex the fe 2p spectrum of cts fe was investigated fig 3e for the pristine cts fe two main peaks were observed at 710 5 fe 2p 3 2 and 724 8 ev fe 2p 1 2 lv et al 2015 the peak of fe 2p 3 2 was decomposed into three peaks located at 715 0 ev 712 9 ev and 710 5 ev implying that the valence state of iron is fe3 liu et al 2016 the fe 2p 3 2 peak is related to the satellite peak at 718 7 ev omran et al 2015 additionally another satellite peak at 728 1 ev may also belong to fe 2p 1 2 after the ad process two new peaks at 709 9 and 723 8 ev were observed in the positions of fe 2p 3 2 and fe 2p 1 2 respectively representing the fe2 state bae et al 2018 shaw et al 2017 moreover the relative areas for the fe3 peaks decreased from 79 7 to 66 8 while those of fe2 increased by 24 5 these results suggest that a portion of fe3 might be reduced to fe2 in the cts fe composite during ad 3 4 3 xrd and sem eds analysis in order to determine the morphology and chemical composition of p bound to cts fe after the ad process xrd and sem eds were performed seen from the xrd results the cts fe exhibited strong and sharp diffraction peaks after the ad process fig 4 well indexed to vivianite jcpds no 75 1186 and fe2fe pyrophosphate jcpds no 80 2315 the main p containing crystal phases accounting for 30 2 and 69 8 wt respectively table s3 the sem images of the cts fe complex before and after ad are provided in fig 5 the pristine cts fe had tight and uneven striatum folds on the surface fig 5a attributable to uneven volatilization of ammonia and water molecules on the surface of cts fe composite while widespread distribution of sheet or needle shaped crystals and amorphous colloids were clearly observed on the cts fe surface after the ad process whose morphology fig 5b and c agrees with previous reports prot et al 2019 rothe et al 2016 to further determine the composition of crystals on the cts fe surface eds analysis was performed after the ad process the eds mapping analysis focused on a specific area localized on the sem image fig 5d table 5 shows the main elemental compositions on the surface of cst fe and the recovered crystals after ad p was detected on the surface of cts fe and crystals with contents being about 9 4 and 8 4 wt respectively this result again confirmed that the p has been adsorbed on the cts fe surface it is noteworthy that a small amount of mg 2 1 wt was detected in the crystals probably contributed by the structure that allows fe2 atoms of vivianite to be replaced by other divalent cations it has been reported that dissolved metallic mg might appear in sewage and be incorporated into the vivianite structure prot et al 2019 wang et al 2019 in this study the molar ratio of fe mg p was 1 4 which is within the range of the vivianite ratio 3 5 mechanisms analysis one major objective of this study is to verify the feasibility of p recovery as vivianite from was via ad by cts fe supplementation in this study the sequential extraction method as well as material characterization were used to interpret the possible mechanisms and migration pathways of p three main aspects will be discussed in this section 1 the mechanisms of p recovery from was and vivianite formation by cts fe addition 2 the effect of cts fe addition on p transformation and its pathways during ad of was and 3 the effect of cts fe addition on properties of treated was in this experiment characterization of the cts fe material before and after ad suggests a possible mechanism of p recovery the p 2p spectrum indicates that the p on the surface of the material after ad can be grouped into po4 3 and hpo4 2 thus it is inferred that p is mainly combined with cts fe in these two forms previous studies have shown that cts fe can adsorb phosphate from aqueous solution through ligand exchange and electrostatic interaction the decreased area ratio of m oh in the o 1s spectrum indicates that this ligand exchange occurred during ad however the n 1s spectrum of xps shows that electrostatic attraction may not occur during the ad process therefore it can be concluded that chemical rather than physical reactions took precedence on the surface of cst fe during the ad test sem eds results show the formation of a large number of vivianite crystals on the surface of cst fe which is closely related to fe iii on the surface of cts fe the fe iii on cst fe can be mainly hydrolyzed to form hydrated iron oxide during ad chen et al 2019 in an anaerobic environment dissimilatory metal reducing bacteria dmrb can reduce fe iii to fe ii and then combine with ortho p to form vivianite crystals o loughlin et al 2013 the specific equations related are as follows 2 f e 3 3 h 2 o f e o h 3 3 h 3 f e o h 3 h e f e o h 2 h 2 o 4 3 f e 2 2 p o 4 3 8 h 2 o f e 3 p o 4 2 8 h 2 o according to a previous report the rate and extent of fe iii reduction largely depends on the fe iii sources lovley 1991 cheng et al 2015 found that incomplete reduction of fe iii may also occur under anaerobic conditions even if the electron donors mainly sludge organics for fe iii reduction in the system are sufficient in this study the presence of fe iii on cst fe was noticed after ad this phenomenon may be related to the fe iii on the surface of the cts fe combined with p through ligand exchange which can be explained in the following equations zhang et al 2018 5 r f e o h h p o 4 2 r f e h p o 4 2 o h 6 r f e o h p o 4 3 r f e p o 4 3 o h under anaerobic conditions phosphate accumulating organisms paos can degrade long chain poly p to short chain poly p pyro p and ortho p in these processes most of the pyro p and ortho p can be leaked to the surrounding eps matrix li et al 2015 then phosphate is subsequently released via cell lysis during ad of was in this study a slight decrease in tp in solid liquid while a remarkable increase of tp in the liquid phase was noticed in the control after ad fig 2a and table 3 rc suggesting the effective conversion of p in the solid sludge into phosphate in the liquid phase via ad compared with the control significant p removal from the solid and liquid phases were detected in the cts fe added reactors in which naip decreased considerably after ad it has been reported that the concentration of phosphate in liquid digestate during ad of was is closely related to the degree of fe iii reduction cao et al 2019 cheng et al 2015 in addition these researchers claimed that the enhanced reduction of fe iii to fe ii in was during ad was mainly contributed by bioreduction process therefore the significant decrease of naip in the sludge with cts fe addition may also be attributed to the reduction of fe iii p compounds in the sludge to highly soluble fe ii p compounds with phosphate being released into the liquid digestate which then can directly interact with cts fe to form an amorphous coordination compound or vivianite crystals or co precipitate with each other and or co existing metals again on the surface of cst fe during the ad process besides phosphate paos may release mg ions eds detected a minor amount of mg on the surface of cts fe theoretically struvite can also be formed in the test systems however xrd did not find this phenomenon it has been demonstrated that addition of external fe to anaerobic digesters can hinder struvite formation and that vivianite is preferably formed because it is less soluble than struvite mamais et al 1994 wang et al 2019 moreover the formation of struvite crystals requires strict ph control at 8 0 10 5 and a suitable molar ratio of mg to p mg p 1 li et al 2019a zhang et al 2012 while in this study the ph and molar ratio of mg p were lower than 8 0 and 0 4 respectively therefore the mg detected on cts fe may be attributed to the substitution of fe2 in the vivianite structure as mentioned above the added cts fe can enhance the release of p from sludge in the solid phase and effectively recover p from the liquid phase since chitosan is widely used in agricultural fields as a soil amendment zhang et al 2018 the obtained p loaded cts fe also possesses the potential for being used in agriculture in addition to p fertilizer in addition higher methane production was achieved in the cst fe added reactors in this study probably due to the promotion effect of fe iii on the hydrolysis phase of ad as seen from the evolution of vfas during the first 6 days the ph in the control reactor dropped from 7 2 to 6 7 fig s4 owing to the accumulation of vfas during ad of was in contrast no similar ph drop was observed in the cts fe added reactors this is similar to the finding by cheng et al 2015 who proposed that most of the vfas produced from ad were probably used as electron donors for fe iii reduction thereby alleviating vfa accumulation and preventing the ph from decreasing more specifically methane production in this study was not affected by fe iii reduction due to the presence of excess electron donors in the was as a result the ph slightly increased over the whole ad process in the presence of cts fe most probably due to the neutralization of h from the free amine groups in the cts and oh released by ligand exchange zhang et al 2018 in summary the possible mechanisms involved in the cts fe reactors in this study are illustrated in fig 6 4 conclusions this study is the first report on the effect of cts fe a synthetic environmentally friendly material on p recovery as vivianite from was via ad which could also enhance methane production simultaneously by 11 9 32 2 after ad process the p concentration in the solid and liquid phases were found to decrease with the increase in cts fe dosage while p bioavailability in the solid sludge was improved characterization indicated that in the ad system fe iii on the surface of cts fe was reduced and combined with p to form vivianite crystals through chemical precipitation however the unavailability of some fe iii on the cts fe surface caused the incomplete reduction of fe iii to fe ii in this study p was proposed to be recovered by ligand exchange between phosphate and iron hydrolysates and cts fe as electron acceptor may minimize the accumulation of vfas and enhance the ad process of was declaration of competing interest the authors

17487,fe iii loaded chitosan cts fe composite was used for the first time to remove and recover phosphorus p from waste activated sludge was via anaerobic digestion ad the p transformation pathway and the effect of cts fe addition on the ad process were investigated using batch experiments the p fractionation results indicate that non apatite inorganic phosphorus naip reduction in the solid phase of sludge at 20 g l of cts fe addition 6 72 mg g ss was 2 4 times higher than that in the control 2 77 mg g ss no cts fe addition this is probably brought about by the added cts fe enhanced the reduction of fe iii p compounds in the sludge with phosphate released into the liquid phase cts fe can efficiently recover 95 of p from the liquid digestate of was notably partial fe iii on the cts fe was reduced and effectively combined with p to form vivianite crystals on the cts fe surface during the ad process characterization analysis demonstrated that ligand exchange and chemical precipitation were the dominant mechanisms for p removal recovery furthermore the addition of cts fe increased methane production by 11 9 32 2 under the tested conditions likely attributable to the enhanced hydrolysis of was under cts fe supplementation as the p loaded cts fe particles can be easily separated and recovered from the ad system and further reutilized in agriculture this study could

wastewater treatment plants xps x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xrd x ray diffraction λ lag phase time d 1 introduction tremendous amounts of waste activated sludge was are generated in wastewater treatment plants wwtps as a main byproduct every year which is an arduous task for the solid waste management industry huang and tang 2015 in japan around 170 69 million tons of was were generated in 2017 accounting for about 44 5 of the total industrial waste moe 2020 however according to some reports only 35 of the was are well managed and the sludge treatment is estimated to occupy about half of the total operating costs of a wwtp luo et al 2018 zhao et al 2017 incineration landfill and reutilization as soil conditioner are the main traditional disposal methods for was tyagi and lo 2013 in fact was with a huge production volume contains high levels of nutrients nitrogen n and phosphorus p in addition to high water content huang and tang 2015 it has been reported that around 4 12 p can be concentrated in was when enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr and chemical phosphorus removal cpr techniques are applied in wwtps he et al 2016 xu et al 2015 thus was has been increasingly recognized as a potential and promising source for p recovery anaerobic digestion ad has been proposed as the most attractive method to compete against the above mentioned incineration and landfilling for was treatment due to its capacity for simultaneous bioenergy production and resources recovery volatile fatty acids vfas or methane cao et al 2019 li et al 2018 however the ad process can result in a large amount of phosphate release into the liquid phase of digestate cheng et al 2017 which should be paid much attention when taking the efficient subsequent treatment and resources recovery into consideration that is additional treatment process for the liquid digestate is required before being processed which is also one of the major issues for the sustainable management of ad systems in this context several technologies have been employed to recover p from the liquid digestate in which crystallization has been extensively researched through coupling hydrothermal pretreatment with crystallization of magnesium ammonium phosphate map or struvite rahaman et al 2014 simulated the removal and recovery of p from the liquid digestate via struvite crystallization in a fluidized bed reactor on the other hand recently p recovery from was as vivianite has gained more attention due to its higher p recovery efficiency and economic value wilfert et al 2018 wu et al 2019 for instance cao et al 2019 obtained about 82 60 of total p tp recovered as vivianite during ad of was under optimal fecl3 dosage and ph condition although these techniques are valid they have limited practical applications mainly owing to the following disadvantages 1 complex operating conditions 2 low p recovery efficiency from liquid digestate while with high residual p in the solid sludge 3 high operating costs due to chemical reagents addition and 4 difficulty in direct separation and purification of phosphate precipitate from the treated was egle et al 2016 hao et al 2013 li et al 2019a wang et al 2019 wilfert et al 2018 wu et al 2019 consequently it is still highly demanded to develop more efficient and environment friendly methods for p recovery from the liquid digestate of was prior to its further treatment by the subsequent processes on the other hand low methane yield and sludge reduction rate to some extent limit the application of ad in was treatment zhang et al 2014 as it is known ad is generally proceeded in the following sequential three steps namely hydrolysis acidogenesis and methanogenesis among the above three steps hydrolysis is regarded as the rate limiting step of ad of was because microbial cell walls in sludge are resistant to be decomposed peng et al 2018 as noted the slow electron exchange rate among anaerobes might be the main reason for the low efficiency of methanogenesis stage during ad yang et al 2017 therefore development of a new technology for simultaneous p recovery with enhanced methane production is of vast significance for ad of was as an inexpensive and environmentally friendly carbon based material granular chitosan fe iii complex cts fe with higher p adsorption capacity 15 7 mg p g than other existing adsrbents has been successfully developed and employed to adsorb phosphate from wastewater zhang et al 2018 notably previous studies have found that fe iii could be reduced as fe ii by dissimilatory metal reducing bacteria dmrb under anaerobic condition o loughlin et al 2013 rothe et al 2016 which may further combine with phosphate to form vivianite thus fe on the surface of the cts fe composite may have the ability to improve p recovery during ad of was furthermore results from previous studies hao et al 2017 peng et al 2018 yang et al 2017 zhao et al 2018 indicate that conductive carbon based materials or fe iii can accelerate direct interspecies electron transfer diet and enhance hydrolysis during ad of was resulting in improved methane production up to now however little information is available on the effect of cts fe composites on methane production and p recovery from was during ad this study attempted for the first time to simultaneously recover p and enhance methane production from was by adding the fe loaded chitosan complex cts fe specifically the objectives of this study were to 1 investigate the feasibility of cts fe for p recovery as vivianite from was via ad 2 evaluate the efficacy of cts fe addition on methane production from was and 3 reveal the mechanisms involved in p transformation and pathways during ad of was in the presence of cts fe 2 materials and methods 2 1 material synthesis and preparation cts powder 27 g was first dissolved in 900 ml of 2 v v acetic acid and then fecl3 6h2o 0 1 m was added to the solution the solution was continuously stirred for 4 h and then the mixed solution was added dropwise into an ammonia solution 6 25 v v with a syringe after standing for 1 h the obtained gel beads were thoroughly washed with deionized water and dried at 50 c for 24 h in this study was and digested sludge which represent the substrate and inoculum respectively were collected from a domestic wwtp in ibaraki prefecture japan and stored at 4 c before use the main characteristics of the was and digested sludge are shown in table 1 2 2 batch ad experiments an 80 ml mixture which contained was substrate and digested sludge inoculum at a ratio of 8 2 v v was incubated in a 100 ml digestion bottle to investigate the effects of different cts fe dosage on the ad of was four test groups containing 0 5 10 and 20 g l cts fe with initial sludge vs ts 0 77 were operated in parallel and marked as rc r1 r2 and r3 respectively before digestion the initial ph was adjusted to 7 2 using 0 1 m hcl or 0 1 m naoh next the bottles were sealed with rubber stoppers and flushed with nitrogen gas for 3 min and then incubated at 38 2 c for 30 days at the end of batch ad experiments the granular cts fe composites were completely separated from the sludge through an 32 mesh sieve 0 5 mm the obtained granular cts fe composite was washed with deionized water and dried at 50 c for 24 h and then stored in enclosed plastic bags for subsequent analysis 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 general indices total solids ts and volatile solids vs contents in the sludge samples were determined according to the standard methods apha 2012 biogas was collected using a gas tight 60 ml syringe every two days and the methane content in biogas was analyzed by gas chromatography gc 8a shimadzu japan volatile fatty acids vfas were quantified by another gas chromatography gc 14b shimadzu japan ph was determined with a ph meter fe20 mettler toledo switzerland 2 3 2 characterization methods in this study the cts fe samples used for characterization were obtained from r2 10 g l cts fe before and after ad the morphology and elemental composition of the cts fe and the crystals on cts fe surface were analyzed by the scanning electron microscopy sem coupled with energy dispersion spectroscopy sem eds ssx 550 shimadzu japan while the crystallized phase of the cts fe after ad was analyzed by x ray diffraction xrd d8 focus bruker germany fourier transform infrared spectrometery ftir vertex 70v bruker germany and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps escalab250xi thermo fisher usa were used to determine the functional groups and their binding states in cts fe the detailed operation conditions for sem eds xrd ftir and xps are described in the supplementary data table s1 2 3 3 p fractionation in solid sludge by smt protocol in this study the standards measurements and testing smt extraction protocol was applied to analyze p fractions garcía albacete et al 2012 the detailed procedure is presented in the supplementary data fig s1 p in the solid phase of sludge can sequentially be determined in five categories total phosphorus tp inorganic p ip organic p op non apatite inorganic p naip associated with fe al and mn and apatite p ap ca bound the naip and op are generally deemed as bioavailable p as they can be potentially utilized by microorganisms and plants the extracted p and phosphate in the liquid phase were measured using the molybdenum blue method apha 2012 with a uv visible spectrophotometer uv 1800 shimadzu japan 2 4 kinetics analysis to quantitatively analyze the effect of cts fe addition on methane production during ad of was the experimental data from the batch test was fitted to the modified gompertz equation lay et al 1999 1 p p max exp exp r max e p max λ t 1 where p is the observed cumulative methane yield ml g vs pmax is the methane production potential ml g vs rmax is the maximum methane production rate ml g vs d λ is the lag phase time d t is the operation duration d and e is euler s number 2 718281 2 5 statistical analysis all experiments were conducted in triplicate the data presented in the results and discussion are average values for data analysis one way analysis of variance anova was applied to analyze statistical difference in the experimental data using microsoft office excel 2016 the xps and xrd results were analyzed by xpspeak 4 1 and mdi jade 9 0 respectively origin 9 0 was used to fit the kinetic model 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect on methane production the effects of cts fe addition on cumulative methane yield and daily methane production from was are illustrated in figs 1 a and b respectively as shown in fig 1a methane production was significantly increased under cts fe addition condition the accumulative methane yields at cts fe dosage of 5 0 10 0 and 20 g l were 209 9 236 6 and 247 9 ml g vs respectively about 12 26 and 32 higher than the control without cts fe addition 187 5 ml g vs much higher daily methane production peak 44 1 ml g vs d was detected on day 12 in r3 20 g l cts fe compared with that in rc 31 2 ml g vs d on day 20 fig 1b in order to make clear the effect of cts fe on methane production from was of ad the relevant parameters obtained by fitting the experimental data to the modified gompertz model are shown in table 2 the correlation coefficients r2 0 994 0 998 suggest the goodness of the gompertz models fitting to the experimental data and the predicted results were almost consistent with the experimental results compared to the control rc the reactors with cts fe addition r1 r2 and r3 showed relatively higher methane production the methane production potential pmax and the maximum methane production rate rmax increased with the increase in cts fe dosage with the maximum increase in pmax 24 observed at 20 g l of cts fe addition the rmax was increased by 13 33 under the addition of cts fe in addition the lag time for methane production was shortened by 40 when 20 g l of cts fe was supplemented these results indicate that cts fe addition could significantly enhance the methane production from ad of was the enhanced methane production was probably ascribed to the promoted anaerobic hydrolysis acidification of complex matters in was by fe iii on the surface of cts fe beneficial for methanogenesis and organics mineralization zhang et al 2014 besides cts fe as the carbon based material may be able to stimulate diet to boost electron transfer between the substrates and microbes lin et al 2017 3 2 effect on vfas evolution the variation of vfas during the ad process is shown in fig s2 acetic and propionic acids are the two main constituents accounting for 31 5 and 19 5 of the total vfas 468 9 mg cod l respectively in the raw was in the reactors with cts fe addition the maximum vfas concentrations of 2239 8 mg cod l 5 g l 2328 5 mg cod l 10 g l and 2494 2 mg cod l 20 g l were respectively detected in r1 r3 on day 3 in contrast a lower maximum vfas concentration in the control 2144 1 mg cod l was noticed on day 6 the concentrations of vfas however declined rapidly thereafter in all the reactors attributable to the consumption by methanogens this observation is in accordance with the methane production trend moreover as shown in table s2 the vs reductions in the cts fe reactors were increased by about 1 04 1 22 times that in the control 27 4 meng et al 2013 demonstrated that the enhancement of organic matter reduction was related to the improved activity of hydrolytic enzymes under the addition of fe0 the observation in this study suggests that cts fe may promote the hydrolysis of was with improved vs reduction and vfas production during the ad process moreover the concentrations of propionic acid in the cts fe reactors were detected to decrease faster than in the control indicating that cts fe may promote the decomposition of propionate this result is consistent with zhang et al 2014 who observed that the rusty scrap improved the conversion of propionate in ad of was 3 3 changes in p fractionation during ad in order to investigate the distribution and migration of p in was during the ad process this study used the smt protocol to extract p fractions in the solid phase and determined the proportions of p in the solid and liquid phases as shown in table 3 most of the p 66 3 in the raw was were distributed in the solid phase in which op occupied 4 0 of tp and maintained at 1 83 0 03 mg g ss fig 2 b during the whole ad process from the analysis of p mass balance the p concentration in the liquid phase of was in rc increased by 39 5 at the end of digestion with a corresponding p reduction in the solid phase it has previously been reported that this decrease may be brought about by the decomposition of extracellular polymeric substances eps that release p containing organic matter which can be then hydrolyzed into ortho p chen et al 2019 monea et al 2020 compared with rc the increase in p concentration in the liquid phase of was was not detected in the cts fe added reactors fig 2a and table 3 in which the tp in the liquid digestate decreased from 371 81 to 17 58 mg p l at the end of experiment under the addition of 20 g l of cts fe r3 this confirms that cts fe could effectively adsorb phosphate from the liquid digestate of was it was noteworthy that the content of op solid phase of the sludge slightly increased when the cts fe dosage was increased from 5 g l r1 to 10 g l r2 possibly due to the increased number of microorganisms such as acidogenic bacteria and sulfate reducing bacteria srb yang et al 2019 which needs further investigation on the other hand ip in solid dominated the raw was 94 2 of tp in the solid of sludge with naip and ap amounting to 73 5 and 26 5 of the ip respectively fig 2b during the ad process the naip and ap contents in the solid phase in the cts fe added reactors decreased with the increase in cts fe dosage which notably decreased from 21 54 to 14 82 mg g ss and 7 76 to 3 68 mg g ss at 20 g l of cts fe respectively in contrast the naip and ap contents in the sludge slightly decreased by 2 77 and 1 50 mg g ss in rc respectively previous studies have shown that iron addition can increase the naip content in sludge during ad process li et al 2019b claimed that the naip in sludge with iron addition increased by 14 compared to the raw sludge however in this work the naip and ap contents in sludge in r3 20 g l of cts fe addition decreased by 31 2 and 52 6 after 30 days ad respectively this observation implies that the added cts fe may stimulate the transformation of ip in the solid phase of sludge and then release fe2 3 like ions into the liquid phase and the latter can further enhance the removal and recovery of phosphate from the liquid digestate during the ad process moreover naip and op which are generally regarded as potentially bioavailable p accounted for 75 3 of tp in the raw sludge results show that the bioavailable p was increased to 79 9 5 g l 81 8 10 g l and 82 0 20 g l in the three cts fe added reactors on day 30 respectively most probably attributable to the decreased tp content in the sludge with the increase of cts fe dosage under the test conditions p adsorption capacity of cst fe decreased from 91 43 mg g r1 to 59 98 mg g r2 and 36 15 mg g r3 much higher than its use for the treatment of synthetic phosphate containing wastewater 15 70 mg g 30 c zhang et al 2018 this observation is mainly due to much higher initial phosphate concentration 370 mg l and more complex composition of the liquid digestate involving more pathways to remove p in this study 3 4 characterization of cts fe 3 4 1 ftir to investigate the mechanisms of p removal and recovery the ftir spectra of cts fe before and after ad process were analyzed fig s3 the bands at 1657 and 1594 cm 1 can be assigned to acetylated amino group nh2 on cts the characteristic peak at 1594 cm 1 almost disappeared after ad meaning that amino might be partially substituted furthermore a new peak appeared at 1325 cm 1 c n stretching of amide iii after ad ntohogian et al 2018 the absorption bands at 1157 and 1028 cm 1 correspond to asymmetric stretching of c o c bridge and hydroxyl group ch2 oh stretching which was weakened after ad barbosa et al 2019 the absorption bands at 896 661 and 419 cm 1 are related to metal oxygen fe o bonds in the complexes cornell and schwertmann 2003 deng et al 2016 tofik et al 2016 it is obviously seen that the adsorption bands shifted from 661 to 562 cm 1 and weakened at 896 and 419 cm 1 after ad moreover the band at 1070 cm 1 associated with the asymmetry vibration of sorbed po4 3 li et al 2014 tofik et al 2016 increased in intensity after ad all the above results suggest that the stretching bands of fe o were involved in p adsorption on the surface of cst fe 3 4 2 xps xps is a useful tool to determine the material s surface functional groups to further explain the mechanisms involved in this work the xps spectra of the cts fe composites were analyzed the xps spectra of o n fe and p for the samples before and after ad are shown in fig 3 and the detailed fitting parameters are presented in table 4 the wide scan xps spectra of cts fe indicated the presence of o n fe and p elements fig 3a a new peak at the binding energy around 130 0 ev assigning to p 2p was clearly observed on cts fe after ad suggesting that phosphates were successfully adsorbed onto cts fe the spectrum of o 1s can be deconvoluted into three individual component peaks fig 3b the peaks well fit at 530 1 531 5 and 532 8 ev probably attributable to the oxygen bonded to metal m o the hydroxyl bonded to metal m oh and the bonded water h2o respectively zhang et al 2018 after the ad process the binding energies of the three peaks of o 1s shifted to 530 8 531 7 and 532 9 respectively the area ratio of the m oh peak decreased from 15 4 to 10 0 while the relative area of the m o peak increased significantly from 9 8 to 19 1 the variations of the binding energy and area ratio at m oh suggest that the iron hydrolysate on the surface of cst fe participated in ad during the phosphate adsorption process by ligand exchange as previously reported cts can interact with many transition metal ions through a chelation mechanism qu et al 2011 therefore the change in the m o peak might be associated with the combination of added metal and material itself during the ad process the n 1s spectrum of the pristine cts fe fig 3c well fits with the two peaks at 399 5 and 401 3 ev the first peak exhibits a greater intensity which is associated with the presence of non protonated nh2 or nh amino groups while the peak at 401 3 ev can be assigned to the presence of protonated amino groups nh3 de godoi et al 2013 a noticeable shift of 0 3 ev was observed in the characteristic peak for protonated species nh3 after the ad process the percentage of protonated species increased from 3 3 to 18 1 while the non protonated amino group species decreased by 14 8 this phenomenon can be ascribed to the protonation of amino groups on the surface of cst fe which may attract hydrogen ions in the solution de godoi et al 2013 additionally this observation also suggests that electrostatic attraction is not the dominant interaction for p recovery from was during the ad process to confirm that p was recovered after ad the p 2p spectra of the cts fe were analyzed one sharp peak was noticed in the p 2p spectrum after the ad process fig 3d this was decomposed into two main peaks located at 132 9 ev and 133 7 ev which can be ascribed to po4 3 and hpo4 2 respectively cui et al 2016 this result reflects that p was effectively combined with the cts fe complex during ad process with p containing mx po4 3 y and mx hpo4 2 y complexes being mainly formed in order to identify the chemical valence states of fe on the surface of the cts fe complex the fe 2p spectrum of cts fe was investigated fig 3e for the pristine cts fe two main peaks were observed at 710 5 fe 2p 3 2 and 724 8 ev fe 2p 1 2 lv et al 2015 the peak of fe 2p 3 2 was decomposed into three peaks located at 715 0 ev 712 9 ev and 710 5 ev implying that the valence state of iron is fe3 liu et al 2016 the fe 2p 3 2 peak is related to the satellite peak at 718 7 ev omran et al 2015 additionally another satellite peak at 728 1 ev may also belong to fe 2p 1 2 after the ad process two new peaks at 709 9 and 723 8 ev were observed in the positions of fe 2p 3 2 and fe 2p 1 2 respectively representing the fe2 state bae et al 2018 shaw et al 2017 moreover the relative areas for the fe3 peaks decreased from 79 7 to 66 8 while those of fe2 increased by 24 5 these results suggest that a portion of fe3 might be reduced to fe2 in the cts fe composite during ad 3 4 3 xrd and sem eds analysis in order to determine the morphology and chemical composition of p bound to cts fe after the ad process xrd and sem eds were performed seen from the xrd results the cts fe exhibited strong and sharp diffraction peaks after the ad process fig 4 well indexed to vivianite jcpds no 75 1186 and fe2fe pyrophosphate jcpds no 80 2315 the main p containing crystal phases accounting for 30 2 and 69 8 wt respectively table s3 the sem images of the cts fe complex before and after ad are provided in fig 5 the pristine cts fe had tight and uneven striatum folds on the surface fig 5a attributable to uneven volatilization of ammonia and water molecules on the surface of cts fe composite while widespread distribution of sheet or needle shaped crystals and amorphous colloids were clearly observed on the cts fe surface after the ad process whose morphology fig 5b and c agrees with previous reports prot et al 2019 rothe et al 2016 to further determine the composition of crystals on the cts fe surface eds analysis was performed after the ad process the eds mapping analysis focused on a specific area localized on the sem image fig 5d table 5 shows the main elemental compositions on the surface of cst fe and the recovered crystals after ad p was detected on the surface of cts fe and crystals with contents being about 9 4 and 8 4 wt respectively this result again confirmed that the p has been adsorbed on the cts fe surface it is noteworthy that a small amount of mg 2 1 wt was detected in the crystals probably contributed by the structure that allows fe2 atoms of vivianite to be replaced by other divalent cations it has been reported that dissolved metallic mg might appear in sewage and be incorporated into the vivianite structure prot et al 2019 wang et al 2019 in this study the molar ratio of fe mg p was 1 4 which is within the range of the vivianite ratio 3 5 mechanisms analysis one major objective of this study is to verify the feasibility of p recovery as vivianite from was via ad by cts fe supplementation in this study the sequential extraction method as well as material characterization were used to interpret the possible mechanisms and migration pathways of p three main aspects will be discussed in this section 1 the mechanisms of p recovery from was and vivianite formation by cts fe addition 2 the effect of cts fe addition on p transformation and its pathways during ad of was and 3 the effect of cts fe addition on properties of treated was in this experiment characterization of the cts fe material before and after ad suggests a possible mechanism of p recovery the p 2p spectrum indicates that the p on the surface of the material after ad can be grouped into po4 3 and hpo4 2 thus it is inferred that p is mainly combined with cts fe in these two forms previous studies have shown that cts fe can adsorb phosphate from aqueous solution through ligand exchange and electrostatic interaction the decreased area ratio of m oh in the o 1s spectrum indicates that this ligand exchange occurred during ad however the n 1s spectrum of xps shows that electrostatic attraction may not occur during the ad process therefore it can be concluded that chemical rather than physical reactions took precedence on the surface of cst fe during the ad test sem eds results show the formation of a large number of vivianite crystals on the surface of cst fe which is closely related to fe iii on the surface of cts fe the fe iii on cst fe can be mainly hydrolyzed to form hydrated iron oxide during ad chen et al 2019 in an anaerobic environment dissimilatory metal reducing bacteria dmrb can reduce fe iii to fe ii and then combine with ortho p to form vivianite crystals o loughlin et al 2013 the specific equations related are as follows 2 f e 3 3 h 2 o f e o h 3 3 h 3 f e o h 3 h e f e o h 2 h 2 o 4 3 f e 2 2 p o 4 3 8 h 2 o f e 3 p o 4 2 8 h 2 o according to a previous report the rate and extent of fe iii reduction largely depends on the fe iii sources lovley 1991 cheng et al 2015 found that incomplete reduction of fe iii may also occur under anaerobic conditions even if the electron donors mainly sludge organics for fe iii reduction in the system are sufficient in this study the presence of fe iii on cst fe was noticed after ad this phenomenon may be related to the fe iii on the surface of the cts fe combined with p through ligand exchange which can be explained in the following equations zhang et al 2018 5 r f e o h h p o 4 2 r f e h p o 4 2 o h 6 r f e o h p o 4 3 r f e p o 4 3 o h under anaerobic conditions phosphate accumulating organisms paos can degrade long chain poly p to short chain poly p pyro p and ortho p in these processes most of the pyro p and ortho p can be leaked to the surrounding eps matrix li et al 2015 then phosphate is subsequently released via cell lysis during ad of was in this study a slight decrease in tp in solid liquid while a remarkable increase of tp in the liquid phase was noticed in the control after ad fig 2a and table 3 rc suggesting the effective conversion of p in the solid sludge into phosphate in the liquid phase via ad compared with the control significant p removal from the solid and liquid phases were detected in the cts fe added reactors in which naip decreased considerably after ad it has been reported that the concentration of phosphate in liquid digestate during ad of was is closely related to the degree of fe iii reduction cao et al 2019 cheng et al 2015 in addition these researchers claimed that the enhanced reduction of fe iii to fe ii in was during ad was mainly contributed by bioreduction process therefore the significant decrease of naip in the sludge with cts fe addition may also be attributed to the reduction of fe iii p compounds in the sludge to highly soluble fe ii p compounds with phosphate being released into the liquid digestate which then can directly interact with cts fe to form an amorphous coordination compound or vivianite crystals or co precipitate with each other and or co existing metals again on the surface of cst fe during the ad process besides phosphate paos may release mg ions eds detected a minor amount of mg on the surface of cts fe theoretically struvite can also be formed in the test systems however xrd did not find this phenomenon it has been demonstrated that addition of external fe to anaerobic digesters can hinder struvite formation and that vivianite is preferably formed because it is less soluble than struvite mamais et al 1994 wang et al 2019 moreover the formation of struvite crystals requires strict ph control at 8 0 10 5 and a suitable molar ratio of mg to p mg p 1 li et al 2019a zhang et al 2012 while in this study the ph and molar ratio of mg p were lower than 8 0 and 0 4 respectively therefore the mg detected on cts fe may be attributed to the substitution of fe2 in the vivianite structure as mentioned above the added cts fe can enhance the release of p from sludge in the solid phase and effectively recover p from the liquid phase since chitosan is widely used in agricultural fields as a soil amendment zhang et al 2018 the obtained p loaded cts fe also possesses the potential for being used in agriculture in addition to p fertilizer in addition higher methane production was achieved in the cst fe added reactors in this study probably due to the promotion effect of fe iii on the hydrolysis phase of ad as seen from the evolution of vfas during the first 6 days the ph in the control reactor dropped from 7 2 to 6 7 fig s4 owing to the accumulation of vfas during ad of was in contrast no similar ph drop was observed in the cts fe added reactors this is similar to the finding by cheng et al 2015 who proposed that most of the vfas produced from ad were probably used as electron donors for fe iii reduction thereby alleviating vfa accumulation and preventing the ph from decreasing more specifically methane production in this study was not affected by fe iii reduction due to the presence of excess electron donors in the was as a result the ph slightly increased over the whole ad process in the presence of cts fe most probably due to the neutralization of h from the free amine groups in the cts and oh released by ligand exchange zhang et al 2018 in summary the possible mechanisms involved in the cts fe reactors in this study are illustrated in fig 6 4 conclusions this study is the first report on the effect of cts fe a synthetic environmentally friendly material on p recovery as vivianite from was via ad which could also enhance methane production simultaneously by 11 9 32 2 after ad process the p concentration in the solid and liquid phases were found to decrease with the increase in cts fe dosage while p bioavailability in the solid sludge was improved characterization indicated that in the ad system fe iii on the surface of cts fe was reduced and combined with p to form vivianite crystals through chemical precipitation however the unavailability of some fe iii on the cts fe surface caused the incomplete reduction of fe iii to fe ii in this study p was proposed to be recovered by ligand exchange between phosphate and iron hydrolysates and cts fe as electron acceptor may minimize the accumulation of vfas and enhance the ad process of was declaration of competing interest the authors

17488,reservoirs are well known as a far reaching human modification on the functions of natural river networks however changes in the chemistry and reactivity of dissolved organic matter dom responding to hydrological management for water retention structures and its influence on the river carbon cycle remain poorly understood here we show that hydrological management does shape the molecular composition of dom in the world s largest three gorges reservoir as revealed by optical spectroscopy and ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry relatively higher terrestrial input molecular complexity isomeric complexity and environmental stability of dom were observed during the storage period whereas the inverse occurred during the drainage period the results demonstrate that the hydrodynamic processes which are mainly controlled by water intrusion from mainstream to tributaries are likely the underlying mechanism controlling dom chemistry integrated with observations from worldwide river reservoirs the dom degradation experiments suggest that reservoir hydrological management would enhance dom mineralization thereby increase co2 emission and change the river carbon cycle graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dissolved organic matter molecular composition bio and photo degradation three gorges reservoir hydrological management river carbon cycle 1 introduction dissolved organic matter dom in aquatic ecosystem is the major form of reactive carbon stedmon et al 2003 and uncovering the factors controlling the flux and transformation of dom in watersheds is critical for better understanding of the carbon cycling mechanism although land use and or regional watershed heterogeneity could affect the dom dynamics e g lu et al 2013 roebuck et al 2019 hydrology exerts a significant control on dom dynamics throughout aquatic ecosystem battin et al 2009 previous studies demonstrated that changes in rainfall discharge and water level did affect the quantity composition and lability of dom in rivers and lakes significantly inamdar et al 2011 zhou et al 2016 bao et al 2019 concentrations of dissolved organic carbon doc usually increase with high discharge e g hu et al 2016 and also dom quality towards with higher terrestrial humic like signature vidon et al 2008 fellman et al 2009 inamdar et al 2011 zhou et al 2016 however compared to the natural river and lake systems river reservoirs are more complicated due to hydrological management by water retention structures resulting in the formation of a semi lake semi river system especially for the tributaries of reservoirs therefore as a by product seasonal algal blooms are increasingly observed in tributaries and even in the mainstream of reservoirs e g maavara et al 2020 this should change the river carbon cycle by modulating the co2 emissions and dom has been considered to be a main factor accounting for the co2 emissions based on a survey of global reservoirs barros et al 2011 theoretically the degradation of labile components in dom could play a key role in controlling the co2 emissions which is further constrained by hydrological management in river reservoirs however few studies to date focused on the man made reservoir induced dom dynamics and its influence on the biogeochemical process li et al 2016 oliver et al 2016 jiang et al 2018 as the most far reaching human modifications of the flows of rivers the construction and operation of worldwide reservoirs significantly changed the hydrologic conditions honti et al 2010 mallik and richardson 2009 leading to non free flowing status for about 70 of global rivers grill et al 2019 three gorges reservoir tgr the largest man made reservoir in the world plays a crucial role in the economic development of china since its full operation in 2012 with a watershed area of 1080 km2 along the yangtze river tgr exerts a storage capacity of 39 3 billion m3 from chongqing to yichang the operation of tgr complicates regional geomorphology and results in hydrologic alterations for instance the lentic aquatic environments of tgr especially in tributaries are propitious to the release of sediment derived nutrients to the overlying water and activate seasonal algae blooms han et al 2018 the periodically submerged water level fluctuation zone is formed with an anti season water level variation of 30 m ranges higher in winter 175m lower in summer 145m these hydrological alterations have been proven to be significant impacts on the regional biogeochemical cycle zhao et al 2013 however it is still mysterious whether the tgr reservoir management makes an impact on structuring composition and lability of dom and further on the biogeochemical and carbon cycle in river reservoirs elucidating the influence of hydrologic conditions on dom chemistry remains a challenge because of its tremendous chemical heterogeneity multiple sources i e autochthonous and allochthonous and complex compositions in the last three decades the application of a suite of state of the art techniques has vastly broadened the understanding of dom characters at bulk and molecular levels e g minor et al 2014 the nmr spectroscopy provides structural information of dom but it has relatively low resolution 102 to 105 hertkorn et al 2013 in contrast ultra high resolution fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms 104 to 105 has shown promising applications identifying dom molecular information which is an important determinant of its sources lability transformation processes and ultimate fate in aquatic environments nebbioso and piccolo 2013 lu et al 2020 moreover with the application of ion mobility mass spectrometry im ms the isomeric information on natural dom molecules can be obtained lu et al 2018 which is crucial in exploring factors controlling dom cycle combined with the traditionally optical spectroscopy and stable isotope analyses our understanding of dom chemistry is significantly improved stubbins et al 2014 lu et al 2018 with the help of new methods this study tries to probe hydrological management influence on the dom molecular composition in river reservoirs here the xiangxi river xxr one of the most representative tributaries of tgr and two mainstream sites closest to the three gorges dam tgd were selected to assess the dom chemistry dynamics during the drainage and storage periods induced by hydrological management the objectives of this study are to i track dom dynamics and lability during drainage storage periods ii explore the potential mechanisms of reservoir management associated hydrological changes in shaping the dom molecular composition and iii assess the linkage between dom chemistry and the carbon cycle i e co2 emissions in river reservoirs 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection and experimental design we selected 10 sampling sites to investigate the variability in dom chemistry during the drainage and storage periods in the head section of tgr fig 1 a the site mp is located at the mainstream closest to the dam and the site cjxx at the junction of xiangxi river and mainstream the other 8 sites xx00 xx07 located at xxr one of the largest tributaries closest to the dam these sites were representative of the aquatic system changes drainage storage periods of tgr by the water management control water level adjustment to minimize the effect of precipitation and river discharge differences which are known to affect the quality and quantity of dom e g inamdar et al 2011 zhou et al 2016 and to maximize the detection of the specific effect of water management control we purposely performed the sampling during april drainage period the intermediate impoundment water level of ca 160 m and november storage period the highest impoundment water level of ca 175 m of the year 2017 with no significant differences in monthly averaged air temperature precipitation and river discharge speed fig 1b surface water samples ca 1 m deep were collected along the xxr tgd transect based on its topography all water samples were collected using hydrochloric acid trace metal

the originally filtered sample was regarded as the zero day samples after bio incubation the samples were filtered through 0 22 μm before further analyses 2 2 bulk geochemical analyses after filtering

been proven to be a powerful tool to study the sources and transformation processes of dom in various aquatic environments e g nebbioso and piccolo 2013 it will introduce the uncertainty of interpretations on the dom characters because ft icr ms can only measure compounds with a small range of molecular weight 200 to 800 da here in order to reduce this uncertainty a combined use of bulk

was significantly higher in the drainage period than that in the storage period two protein like c2 and c4 and two humic like c1 and c3 components were revealed by parafac analyses table s2 c1 was considered to be associated with relatively high aromatic compounds or fulvic acid while c3 was previously found in dom from farmland environments cawley et al 2012 murphy et al 2014 c2 and c4 were tryptophan like and tyrosine like components respectively fig s2 these components were previously identified in dom from various ecosystems including inland waters and coastal wetlands murphy et al 2014 stedmon and markager 2005 the average relative proportions of c1 and c3 components in the storage period 69 5 were significantly higher than those in the drainage period 34 2 whereas the average relative proportions of c2 and c4 components in the drainage period 66 2 were significantly higher than those in the storage period 31 5 fig 2e f 3 3 molecular dom complexity as determined by ft icr

respectively fig s3 and 4904 molecular formulas co occurred which accounted for 68 and 49 of unique formulas in the drainage and storage periods respectively table s3 both the number of unique formula and the ratio of common unique formula suggested a much higher complexity of dom in the storage period a total of 3247 and 3897 cho unique formulas were determined in dom from the drainage and storage periods respectively with 2200 cho formulas shared no significant difference was observed in the average relative abundance of cho compounds between the drainage 71 2 1 5 and storage 71 4 2 6 periods a total of 2995 and 3695 chon unique formulas were determined in dom from the drainage and storage periods respectively with 1902 chon formulas shared the averaged relative intensity of chon formula

could have several structural isomers tose et al 2018 isomeric information and variations on several molecular formulae were further assessed through the ion mobility mass spectrometry table s6 lu et al 2018 isomer percentage was calculated as number of different formulas possessing isomer total number of different formulas ⅹ 100 although the isomeric variations were obtained for a small number of molecular formulas the results showed that the isomeric percentages of dom ranged from 4 5 to 12 5 ave 8 1 2 7 and 6 3 to 24 2 ave 14 0 5 5 during the drainage and storage periods respectively suggesting the averaged isomer percentage significantly higher in the storage period than that in the drainage period fig s4 3 4 the degradation behavior of dom during the drainage and storage periods bio incubation experiments between 0 and 30 days show a decrease of doc concentrations by 32 0 56 mg l and 26 0 40 mg l on average during the drainage and storage periods respectively fig 3 a hix and

highly unsaturated compounds decreased by 0 5 and 0 1 on average during the drainage period and 3 and 8 on average during the storage period respectively fig 3k l 4 discussion 4 1 multiple sources contribution to dom in tgr dom in the river system can be from watershed terrestrial anthropogenic inputs as well as autochthonous input jaffé et al 2014 the values of hix 0 40 0 76 suva254 2 69 6 38 l mg c 1 m 1 and fi 1 70 2 24 fig 2 fig s1 which were previously used to determine the humification and aromaticity degree of dom and to distinguish terrestrial vs microbial sources showed similar ranges to those observed in other inland waters e g kellerman et al 2018 suggesting allochthonous and autochthonous sources of dom in tgr the multiple sources of dom in tgr are mainly controlled by regional high coverage of forest farmland barren land along xxr and river nutrient status table s1 δ13c values of dom in tgr ranged from 28 4 to 27 1 fig 2 indicating the presence of terrestrial input cawley et al 2012 two humic like components c1 and c3 in fdom could be mostly associated with terrestrial input osburn et al 2011 murphy et al 2014 a relative abundance of 10 6 0 6 of polyphenols in ft icr ms could be indicative of vascular plant sourced organic matter input seidel et al 2015 highly unsaturated compounds detected in ft icr ms were also considered to be related to the soil derived products of lignin degradation seidel et al 2015 spearman s rank correlations r 0 5 p 0 01 between parafac components or other optical indices and molecular groups in ft icr ms showed that the terrestrial source indicators c1 and c3 humic like components were significantly correlated with the presence of polyphenols and highly unsaturated compounds with higher averaged molecular mass ai and o c ratios but lower h c ratios detected by ft icr ms fig 4 fig s5 table s7 meanwhile polyphenols and highly unsaturated compounds which are photoactive and degrade quickly when exposed to sunlight stubbins and dittmar 2015 tracked most closely with suva254 and hix fig s5 table s7 previous studies suggested that protein like component c4 was associated with algal production whereas c2 likely sourced from anthropogenic inputs in the tgr wang et al 2019a the relative abundance of peptides 0 70 0 21 and unsaturated aliphatics 7 78 3 62 in ft icr ms suggested that bacterial and algal derived om contributed to dom in tgr kujawinski et al 2004 seidel et al 2015 kellerman et al 2018 however no significant correlation was observed between c4 and peptides or unsaturated aliphatics furthermore c4 correlated with the least number of formulas fig 4 fig s5 table s7 this might be attributed to c4 sourced from the degradation of larger peptides coble et al 1990 with high molecular mass compounds and beyond the analytical window by ft icr ms molecular weight 800 da here or the poor ionization efficiency of peptide like formula during the electron spray ionization process in contrast unsaturated aliphatics and peptides with low molecular weight and high degrees of bio lability tracked most closely with fi bix and sr fig s5 table s7 indicating a degree of microbial activity huguet et al 2010 and their contribution to the dom pool in tgr a series of chos compounds with the high relative intensity of o3s and o5s classes were detected leading to the non gaussian distribution of chos class fig s6 highly relative intensities of o3s and o5s classes were previously detected in anthropogenically perturbated waters including wastewater and could be an indicator of anthropogenic input gonsior et al 2011 wagner et al 2015 he et al 2019 although natural inputs may also contribute to these compounds poulin et al 2017 here c2 protein like component was most significantly correlated with o3s and o5s class compounds table s7 further supporting a contribution of dom from anthropogenic input 4 2 hydrological management constraints on dom chemistry in tgr the principal component analysis was conducted and the loadings of the first and second principal components pc1 and pc2 explained 59 and 20 of the variations in dom dynamics in tgr fig 5 pc1 showed strongly positive loadings that were related to humification associated parameters e g suva254 and ai parafac components e g c1 and molecular groups e g highly unsaturated compounds whereas negative loadings of pc1 were mostly related to freshly produced dom associated parameters such as bix fi β α and molecular groups e g unsaturated aliphatic compounds pc1 clearly separated samples in the storage period from samples in the drainage period fig 5 compared to pc1 pc2 separated the samples after the 30 days photodegradation from all other samples fig 5 suggesting photo lability of dom is a secondary factor affecting its dynamics based on the bulk optical and molecular parameters and the principal component analysis a significant difference in dom chemistry can be revealed between the drainage and storage periods due to hydrological management compared to the drainage period a relatively higher proportion of terrestrial derived dom and lower proportion of autochthonous and anthropogenic derived dom much higher suva254 hix dbe ai and m z values and much lower sr fi β α and bix values occurred in the storage period fig 2 fig s1 suggesting that dom in the storage period had higher aromaticity humification degree and molecular weight but a lower proportion of microbial or freshly produced dom the relatively higher autochthonous dom in the drainage period may be partially caused by higher algal production which was evidenced by high chl a concentrations during this period ave 9 7 3 2 μg l table s1 also the im ms result revealed much lower isomer percentage in dom from the drainage period fig s4 suggesting less diverse biochemical pathways during this period and further indicative of relatively higher contributions from autochthonous dom liu and lu 2019 due to similar precipitation and water flow between two sampling periods fig 1 which were considered to be main factors controlling terrestrial input in river or lake systems inamdar et al 2011 bao et al 2019 the difference in dom chemistry could be mostly induced by reservoir hydrological management that can strongly influence the physical chemical processes in the reservoir oliver et al 2016 previous studies by ji et al 2010 and yang et al 2018 established a seasonal water exchange model in tgr which was mainly related to the occurrence of reverse density current and further to the occurrence of water intrusion from mainstream to the tributaries fig s7 table s1 the water chemistry results from this study also support this model supplementary results integrated with this water exchange model a conceptual model of dom dynamics was developed to account for the difference of dom chemistry between the drainage and storage periods fig 6 during the drainage period the water management of the tgr resulted in the bottom layer intrusive density current which drove the mainstream water intrusion into surface water of the tributary fig 6 fig s7 because the water extractable dom of surface sediments showed higher humification and aromaticity in xxr upstream than those in the mainstream fig s8 a decrease of terrestrial signal in dom from xxr upstream to mainstream could be indicative of processes involved in the additive of this extra dom into the water column along this transect in the drainage period fig 6a meantime the bottom layer intrusive density current brought the nutrient from the sediments leading to the blooming of algae yang et al 2018 in the storage period no bottom layer intrusive density current was formed and water flowed from xxr upstream to mainstream fig 6b fig s7 resulting in relatively homogenized dom chemistry along the transect therefore dom in the storage period could be mainly from the watershed input as evidenced by a relatively high proportion of terrestrially derived dom the hydrological management induced changes in dom sources and composition also led to the variations in dom lability and complexity between both periods fig 6c d in particular dom showed significantly higher molecular formula and isomeric complexity in the storage period than that in the drainage period resulting in a more divergent character in the storage period but a more convergent character in the drainage period fig 6c d the incubation experiments demonstrated that dom in the drainage period showed relatively higher bio degradability but relatively lower photo degradability than in the storage period figs 4 and 6c d which may be related to the relatively higher algae derived dom input joux et al 2016 the linkage between water management induced changes in dom chemistry should be a general phenomenon in river reservoirs worldwide which warrants further investigations 4 3 linking dom chemistry to co2 emission in tgr and other young reservoirs reservoirs have been identified as a potentially hot spot of carbon loss in the form of co2 emissions which may be mainly controlled by doc concentration and quality based on a survey of global reservoirs n 110 barros et al 2011 it is well known that the photo and biodegradation of organic matter in aquatic systems will finally generate co2 suggesting that the lability of dom could play an important role in controlling riverine co2 partial pressures p co2 and co2 evasion kaplan and cory 2016 lapierre et al 2013 found a strong causal link between doc concentrations and aquatic fluxes of co2 mediated by the degradation of land derived organic carbon in boreal aquatic ecosystems our incubation experiments clearly showed a dom quality dependent degradation during the drainage and storage periods in the tgr the biodegradation of doc by up to 0 56 mg l was observed during the drainage period whereas the photodegradation removed by up to 0 51 mg l doc during the storage period fig 4a g the biodegradation changed dom composition to a less extent compared with photodegradation during the 30 days incubation experiments which is revealed by the principal component analysis fig 5 and cluster analysis fig s9 although the incubation experiment suggests that photodegradation seems to be a more important factor contributing to the changes in dom composition than that of the biodegradation whether it applies to the real environment is complex and needs further investigations kaplan and cory 2016 increasing degradability of dom can be attributed to an increase of autochthonous dom input e g algae blooming during the drainage period in recent years a relatively higher averaged percentage of protein like fluorescent components has been observed in the year 2017 28 to 68 fig 2 than that in the years 2009 and 2012 20 wang et al 2019b in the tgr area this matches well with field observations showing an increasing co2 flux in the xxr upon time sequence the co2 flux in the xxr was 20 mg m 2 d 1 and 160 mg m 2 d 1 in the drainage and storage periods of the year 2011 respectively and 131 mg m 2 d 1 and 195 mg m 2 d 1 in the drainage and storage periods of the year 2016 respectively zhao et al 2011 li 2018 the linkage between dom quality and co2 flux is also supported by recent studies in which they suggested organic carbon mineralization as a dominant control on the p co2 in the tgr area liu et al 2016 ni et al 2020 the annual co2 emissions data from globally surveyed reservoirs with similar age younger than 22 yr of damming to tgr generally demonstrate an increase of co2 flux in world young reservoirs barros et al 2011 table s8 covering both tropical the manso samuel serra da mesa and tucurui reservoirs in brazil and temperate climate areas the petit saut reservoir in france the increase of co2 emission in young reservoirs could be mainly associated with dom concentration and lability which are further controlled by hydrological management algae blooming after several years of reservoir completion could be a key factor to control the dom quality although assessment of the quantitative contribution of dom degradation to co2 emission worth further efforts therefore understanding of dom dynamics in river reservoirs could provide important implications for better constraining the carbon budget in inland waters with more reservoirs planned to be built world commission on dams 2000 maavara et al 2017 grill et al 2019 future management of young reservoirs should further aim at dom chemistry which tightly links to the co2 emission and carbon cycle in inland waters conclusions this study demonstrates the influence of water management induced hydrological alterations on the dom chemistry in the world s largest reservoir tgr significant variations in bulk properties including δ13c doc and cdom were observed between drainage and storage periods the alterations of sources and composition of dom were revealed by the changes in a variety of optical indices fluorescent components identified in eems and molecular and isomeric complexity by ft icr ms and im tof lcms the storage period showed a relative elevation of terrestrial dom input with higher aromaticity and humification degree as well as molecular weight than the drainage period the significant variation of dom chemistry was mainly caused by hydrologic dynamic mode due to reservoir management in contrast to the temporal variation of dom chemistry spatial variation occurred only in the drainage period which is mainly resulted from hydrological gradient generated by water intrusion from the mainstream to the tributary we further suggest that the overall shift in dom chemistry between the drainage and storage periods and the increase of autochthonous input with the age of damming are linked with co2 emission in tgr and other young reservoirs with an increasing number of reservoirs to be built further constraining the influence of reservoir management induced dom dynamics would enhance our ability to predict and model the effects of reservoir dom on downstream systems and better constraining carbon cycle in inland

17488,reservoirs are well known as a far reaching human modification on the functions of natural river networks however changes in the chemistry and reactivity of dissolved organic matter dom responding to hydrological management for water retention structures and its influence on the river carbon cycle remain poorly understood here we show that hydrological management does shape the molecular composition of dom in the world s largest three gorges reservoir as revealed by optical spectroscopy and ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry relatively higher terrestrial input molecular complexity isomeric complexity and environmental stability of dom were observed during the storage period whereas the inverse occurred during the drainage period the results demonstrate that the hydrodynamic processes which are mainly controlled by water intrusion from mainstream to tributaries are likely the underlying mechanism controlling dom chemistry integrated with observations from worldwide river reservoirs the dom degradation experiments suggest that reservoir hydrological management would enhance dom mineralization thereby increase co2 emission and change the river carbon cycle graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dissolved organic matter molecular composition bio and photo degradation three gorges reservoir hydrological management river carbon cycle 1 introduction dissolved organic matter dom in aquatic ecosystem is the major form of reactive carbon stedmon et al 2003 and uncovering the factors controlling the flux and transformation of dom in watersheds is critical for better understanding of the carbon cycling mechanism although land use and or regional watershed heterogeneity could affect the dom dynamics e g lu et al 2013 roebuck et al 2019 hydrology exerts a significant control on dom dynamics throughout aquatic ecosystem battin et al 2009 previous studies demonstrated that changes in rainfall discharge and water level did affect the quantity composition and lability of dom in rivers and lakes significantly inamdar et al 2011 zhou et al 2016 bao et al 2019 concentrations of dissolved organic carbon doc usually increase with high discharge e g hu et al 2016 and also dom quality towards with higher terrestrial humic like signature vidon et al 2008 fellman et al 2009 inamdar et al 2011 zhou et al 2016 however compared to the natural river and lake systems river reservoirs are more complicated due to hydrological management by water retention structures resulting in the formation of a semi lake semi river system especially for the tributaries of reservoirs therefore as a by product seasonal algal blooms are increasingly observed in tributaries and even in the mainstream of reservoirs e g maavara et al 2020 this should change the river carbon cycle by modulating the co2 emissions and dom has been considered to be a main factor accounting for the co2 emissions based on a survey of global reservoirs barros et al 2011 theoretically the degradation of labile components in dom could play a key role in controlling the co2 emissions which is further constrained by hydrological management in river reservoirs however few studies to date focused on the man made reservoir induced dom dynamics and its influence on the biogeochemical process li et al 2016 oliver et al 2016 jiang et al 2018 as the most far reaching human modifications of the flows of rivers the construction and operation of worldwide reservoirs significantly changed the hydrologic conditions honti et al 2010 mallik and richardson 2009 leading to non free flowing status for about 70 of global rivers grill et al 2019 three gorges reservoir tgr the largest man made reservoir in the world plays a crucial role in the economic development of china since its full operation in 2012 with a watershed area of 1080 km2 along the yangtze river tgr exerts a storage capacity of 39 3 billion m3 from chongqing to yichang the operation of tgr complicates regional geomorphology and results in hydrologic alterations for instance the lentic aquatic environments of tgr especially in tributaries are propitious to the release of sediment derived nutrients to the overlying water and activate seasonal algae blooms han et al 2018 the periodically submerged water level fluctuation zone is formed with an anti season water level variation of 30 m ranges higher in winter 175m lower in summer 145m these hydrological alterations have been proven to be significant impacts on the regional biogeochemical cycle zhao et al 2013 however it is still mysterious whether the tgr reservoir management makes an impact on structuring composition and lability of dom and further on the biogeochemical and carbon cycle in river reservoirs elucidating the influence of hydrologic conditions on dom chemistry remains a challenge because of its tremendous chemical heterogeneity multiple sources i e autochthonous and allochthonous and complex compositions in the last three decades the application of a suite of state of the art techniques has vastly broadened the understanding of dom characters at bulk and molecular levels e g minor et al 2014 the nmr spectroscopy provides structural information of dom but it has relatively low resolution 102 to 105 hertkorn et al 2013 in contrast ultra high resolution fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms 104 to 105 has shown promising applications identifying dom molecular information which is an important determinant of its sources lability transformation processes and ultimate fate in aquatic environments nebbioso and piccolo 2013 lu et al 2020 moreover with the application of ion mobility mass spectrometry im ms the isomeric information on natural dom molecules can be obtained lu et al 2018 which is crucial in exploring factors controlling dom cycle combined with the traditionally optical spectroscopy and stable isotope analyses our understanding of dom chemistry is significantly improved stubbins et al 2014 lu et al 2018 with the help of new methods this study tries to probe hydrological management influence on the dom molecular composition in river reservoirs here the xiangxi river xxr one of the most representative tributaries of tgr and two mainstream sites closest to the three gorges dam tgd were selected to assess the dom chemistry dynamics during the drainage and storage periods induced by hydrological management the objectives of this study are to i track dom dynamics and lability during drainage storage periods ii explore the potential mechanisms of reservoir management associated hydrological changes in shaping the dom molecular composition and iii assess the linkage between dom chemistry and the carbon cycle i e co2 emissions in river reservoirs 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection and experimental design we selected 10 sampling sites to investigate the variability in dom chemistry during the drainage and storage periods in the head section of tgr fig 1 a the site mp is located at the mainstream closest to the dam and the site cjxx at the junction of xiangxi river and mainstream the other 8 sites xx00 xx07 located at xxr one of the largest tributaries closest to the dam these sites were representative of the aquatic system changes drainage storage periods of tgr by the water management control water level adjustment to minimize the effect of precipitation and river discharge differences which are known to affect the quality and quantity of dom e g inamdar et al 2011 zhou et al 2016 and to maximize the detection of the specific effect of water management control we purposely performed the sampling during april drainage period the intermediate impoundment water level of ca 160 m and november storage period the highest impoundment water level of ca 175 m of the year 2017 with no significant differences in monthly averaged air temperature precipitation and river discharge speed fig 1b surface water samples ca 1 m deep were collected along the xxr tgd transect based on its topography all water samples were collected using hydrochloric acid trace metal

the originally filtered sample was regarded as the zero day samples after bio incubation the samples were filtered through 0 22 μm before further analyses 2 2 bulk geochemical analyses after filtering

been proven to be a powerful tool to study the sources and transformation processes of dom in various aquatic environments e g nebbioso and piccolo 2013 it will introduce the uncertainty of interpretations on the dom characters because ft icr ms can only measure compounds with a small range of molecular weight 200 to 800 da here in order to reduce this uncertainty a combined use of bulk and spectral analyses as well as ft icr ms was adopted in this study for better constraining interpretations structural isomers of dom molecules were characterized by high resolution im ms following

was significantly higher in the drainage period than that in the storage period two protein like c2 and c4 and two humic like c1 and c3 components were revealed by parafac analyses table s2 c1 was considered to be associated with relatively high aromatic compounds or fulvic acid while c3 was previously found in dom from farmland environments cawley et al 2012 murphy et al 2014 c2 and c4 were tryptophan like and tyrosine like components respectively fig s2 these components were previously identified in dom from various ecosystems including inland waters and coastal wetlands murphy et al 2014 stedmon and markager 2005 the average relative proportions of c1 and c3 components in the storage period 69 5 were significantly higher than those in the drainage period 34 2 whereas the average relative proportions of c2 and c4 components in the drainage period 66 2 were significantly higher than those in the storage period 31 5 fig 2e f 3 3 molecular dom complexity as determined by ft icr ms and im q tof lcms during the drainage and storage periods ft icr ms analyses showed that a total of 7359 and 10136 unique formulas were detected in dom from the drainage and storage periods respectively fig s3 and 4904 molecular formulas co occurred which accounted for 68 and 49 of unique formulas in the drainage and storage periods respectively table s3 both the number of unique formula and the ratio of common unique formula suggested a much higher complexity of dom in the storage period a total of 3247 and 3897 cho unique formulas were determined in dom from the drainage and storage periods respectively with 2200 cho formulas shared no significant difference was observed in the average relative abundance of cho compounds between the drainage 71 2 1 5 and storage 71 4 2 6 periods a total of 2995 and 3695 chon unique formulas were determined in dom from the drainage and storage periods respectively with 1902 chon formulas shared the averaged relative intensity of chon formula

could have several structural isomers tose et al 2018 isomeric information and variations on several molecular formulae were further assessed through the ion mobility mass spectrometry table s6 lu et al 2018 isomer percentage was calculated as number of different formulas possessing isomer total number of different formulas ⅹ 100 although the isomeric variations were obtained for a small number of molecular formulas the results showed that the isomeric percentages of dom ranged from 4 5 to 12 5 ave 8 1 2 7 and 6 3 to 24 2 ave 14 0 5 5 during the drainage and storage periods respectively suggesting the averaged isomer percentage significantly higher in the storage period than that in the drainage period fig s4 3 4 the degradation behavior of dom during the drainage and storage periods bio incubation experiments between 0 and 30 days show a decrease of doc concentrations by 32 0 56 mg l and 26 0 40 mg l on average during the drainage and storage periods respectively fig 3 a hix and suva254 increased by 0 18 and 3 3 l mg c 1 m 1 on average during the drainage period as well as 0 02 and 0 5 l mg c 1 m 1 on average during the storage period respectively fig 3b c dbe increased by 0

highly unsaturated compounds decreased by 0 5 and 0 1 on average during the drainage period and 3 and 8 on average during the storage period respectively fig 3k l 4 discussion 4 1 multiple sources contribution to dom in tgr dom in the river system can be from watershed terrestrial anthropogenic inputs as well as autochthonous input jaffé et al 2014 the values of hix 0 40 0 76 suva254 2 69 6 38 l mg c 1 m 1 and fi 1 70 2 24 fig 2 fig s1 which were previously used to determine the humification and aromaticity degree of dom and to distinguish terrestrial vs microbial sources showed similar ranges to those observed in other inland waters e g kellerman et al 2018 suggesting allochthonous and autochthonous sources of dom in tgr the multiple sources of dom in tgr are mainly controlled by regional high coverage of forest farmland barren land along xxr and river nutrient status table s1 δ13c values of dom in tgr ranged from 28 4 to 27 1 fig 2 indicating the presence of terrestrial input cawley et al 2012 two humic like components c1 and c3 in fdom could be mostly associated with terrestrial input osburn et al 2011 murphy et al 2014 a relative abundance of 10 6 0 6 of polyphenols in ft icr ms could be indicative of vascular plant sourced organic matter input seidel et al 2015 highly unsaturated compounds detected in ft icr ms were also considered to be related to the soil derived products of lignin degradation seidel et al 2015 spearman s rank correlations r 0 5 p 0 01 between parafac components or other optical indices and molecular groups in ft icr ms showed that the terrestrial source indicators c1 and c3 humic like components were significantly correlated with the presence of polyphenols and highly unsaturated compounds with higher averaged molecular mass ai and o c ratios but lower h c ratios detected by ft icr ms fig 4 fig s5 table s7 meanwhile polyphenols and highly unsaturated compounds which are photoactive and degrade quickly when exposed to sunlight stubbins and dittmar 2015 tracked most closely with suva254 and hix fig s5 table s7 previous studies suggested that protein like component c4 was associated with algal production whereas c2 likely sourced from anthropogenic inputs in the tgr wang et al 2019a the relative abundance of peptides 0 70 0 21 and unsaturated aliphatics 7 78 3 62 in ft icr ms suggested that bacterial and algal derived om contributed to dom in tgr kujawinski et al 2004 seidel et al 2015 kellerman et al 2018 however no significant correlation was observed between c4 and peptides or unsaturated aliphatics furthermore c4 correlated with the least number of formulas fig 4 fig s5 table s7 this might be attributed to c4 sourced from the degradation of larger peptides coble et al 1990 with high molecular mass compounds and beyond the analytical window by ft icr ms molecular weight 800 da here or the poor ionization efficiency of peptide like formula during the electron spray ionization process in contrast unsaturated aliphatics and peptides with low molecular weight and high degrees of bio lability tracked most closely with fi bix and sr fig s5 table s7 indicating a degree of microbial activity huguet et al 2010 and their contribution to the dom pool in tgr a series of chos compounds with the high relative intensity of o3s and o5s classes were detected leading to the non gaussian distribution of chos class fig s6 highly relative intensities of o3s and o5s classes were previously detected in anthropogenically perturbated waters including wastewater and could be an indicator of anthropogenic input gonsior et al 2011 wagner et al 2015 he et al 2019 although natural inputs may also contribute to these compounds poulin et al 2017 here c2 protein like component was most significantly correlated with o3s and o5s class compounds table s7 further supporting a contribution of dom from anthropogenic input 4 2 hydrological management constraints on dom chemistry in tgr the principal component analysis was conducted and the loadings of the first and second principal components pc1 and pc2 explained 59 and 20 of the variations in dom dynamics in tgr fig 5 pc1 showed strongly positive loadings that were related to humification associated parameters e g suva254 and ai parafac components e g c1 and molecular groups e g highly unsaturated compounds whereas negative loadings of pc1 were mostly related to freshly produced dom associated parameters such as bix fi β α and molecular groups e g unsaturated aliphatic compounds pc1 clearly separated samples in the storage period from samples in the drainage period fig 5 compared to pc1 pc2 separated the samples after the 30 days photodegradation from all other samples fig 5 suggesting photo lability of dom is a secondary factor affecting its dynamics based on the bulk optical and molecular parameters and the principal component analysis a significant difference in dom chemistry can be revealed between the drainage and storage periods due to hydrological management compared to the drainage period a relatively higher proportion of terrestrial derived dom and lower proportion of autochthonous and anthropogenic derived dom much higher suva254 hix dbe ai and m z values and much lower sr fi β α and bix values occurred in the storage period fig 2 fig s1 suggesting that dom in the storage period had higher aromaticity humification degree and molecular weight but a lower proportion of microbial or freshly produced dom the relatively higher autochthonous dom in the drainage period may be partially caused by higher algal production which was evidenced by high chl a concentrations during this period ave 9 7 3 2 μg l table s1 also the im ms result revealed much lower isomer percentage in dom from the drainage period fig s4 suggesting less diverse biochemical pathways during this period and further indicative of relatively higher contributions from autochthonous dom liu and lu 2019 due to similar precipitation and water flow between two sampling periods fig 1 which were considered to be main factors controlling terrestrial input in river or lake systems inamdar et al 2011 bao et al 2019 the difference in dom chemistry could be mostly induced by reservoir hydrological management that can strongly influence the physical chemical processes in the reservoir oliver et al 2016 previous studies by ji et al 2010 and yang et al 2018 established a seasonal water exchange model in tgr which was mainly related to the occurrence of reverse density current and further to the occurrence of water intrusion from mainstream to the tributaries fig s7 table s1 the water chemistry results from this study also support this model supplementary results integrated with this water exchange model a conceptual model of dom dynamics was developed to account for the difference of dom chemistry between the drainage and storage periods fig 6 during the drainage period the water management of the tgr resulted in the bottom layer intrusive density current which drove the mainstream water intrusion into surface water of the tributary fig 6 fig s7 because the water extractable dom of surface sediments showed higher humification and aromaticity in xxr upstream than those in the mainstream fig s8 a decrease of terrestrial signal in dom from xxr upstream to mainstream could be indicative of processes involved in the additive of this extra dom into the water column along this transect in the drainage period fig 6a meantime the bottom layer intrusive density current brought the nutrient from the sediments leading to the blooming of algae yang et al 2018 in the storage period no bottom layer intrusive density current was formed and water flowed from xxr upstream to mainstream fig 6b fig s7 resulting in relatively homogenized dom chemistry along the transect therefore dom in the storage period could be mainly from the watershed input as evidenced by a relatively high proportion of terrestrially derived dom the hydrological management induced changes in dom sources and composition also led to the variations in dom lability and complexity between both periods fig 6c d in particular dom showed significantly higher molecular formula and isomeric complexity in the storage period than that in the drainage period resulting in a more divergent character in the storage period but a more convergent character in the drainage period fig 6c d the incubation experiments demonstrated that dom in the drainage period showed relatively higher bio degradability but relatively lower photo degradability than in the storage period figs 4 and 6c d which may be related to the relatively higher algae derived dom input joux et al 2016 the linkage between water management induced changes in dom chemistry should be a general phenomenon in river reservoirs worldwide which warrants further investigations 4 3 linking dom chemistry to co2 emission in tgr and other young reservoirs reservoirs have been identified as a potentially hot spot of carbon loss in the form of co2 emissions which may be mainly controlled by doc concentration and quality based on a survey of global reservoirs n 110 barros et al 2011 it is well known that the photo and biodegradation of organic matter in aquatic systems will finally generate co2 suggesting that the lability of dom could play an important role in controlling riverine co2 partial pressures p co2 and co2 evasion kaplan and cory 2016 lapierre et al 2013 found a strong causal link between doc concentrations and aquatic fluxes of co2 mediated by the degradation of land derived organic carbon in boreal aquatic ecosystems our incubation experiments clearly showed a dom quality dependent degradation during the drainage and storage periods in the tgr the biodegradation of doc by up to 0 56 mg l was observed during the drainage period whereas the photodegradation removed by up to 0 51 mg l doc during the storage period fig 4a g the biodegradation changed dom composition to a less extent compared with photodegradation during the 30 days incubation experiments which is revealed by the principal component analysis fig 5 and cluster analysis fig s9 although the incubation experiment suggests that photodegradation seems to be a more important factor contributing to the changes in dom composition than that of the biodegradation whether it applies to the real environment is complex and needs further investigations kaplan and cory 2016 increasing degradability of dom can be attributed to an increase of autochthonous dom input e g algae blooming during the drainage period in recent years a relatively higher averaged percentage of protein like fluorescent components has been observed in the year 2017 28 to 68 fig 2 than that in the years 2009 and 2012 20 wang et al 2019b in the tgr area this matches well with field observations showing an increasing co2 flux in the xxr upon time sequence the co2 flux in the xxr was 20 mg m 2 d 1 and 160 mg m 2 d 1 in the drainage and storage periods of the year 2011 respectively and 131 mg m 2 d 1 and 195 mg m 2 d 1 in the drainage and storage periods of the year 2016 respectively zhao et al 2011 li 2018 the linkage between dom quality and co2 flux is also supported by recent studies in which they suggested organic carbon mineralization as a dominant control on the p co2 in the tgr area liu et al 2016 ni et al 2020 the annual co2 emissions data from globally surveyed reservoirs with similar age younger than 22 yr of damming to tgr generally demonstrate an increase of co2 flux in world young reservoirs barros et al 2011 table s8 covering both tropical the manso samuel serra da mesa and tucurui reservoirs in brazil and temperate climate areas the petit saut reservoir in france the increase of co2 emission in young reservoirs could be mainly associated with dom concentration and lability which are further controlled by hydrological management algae blooming after several years of reservoir completion could be a key factor to control the dom quality although assessment of the quantitative contribution of dom degradation to co2 emission worth further efforts therefore understanding of dom dynamics in river reservoirs could provide important implications for better constraining the carbon budget in inland waters with more reservoirs planned to be built world commission on dams 2000 maavara et al 2017 grill et al 2019 future management of young reservoirs should further aim at dom chemistry which tightly links to the co2 emission and carbon cycle in inland waters conclusions this study demonstrates the influence of water management induced hydrological alterations on the dom chemistry in the world s largest reservoir tgr significant variations in bulk properties including δ13c doc and cdom were observed between drainage and storage periods the alterations of sources and composition of dom were revealed by the changes in a variety of optical indices fluorescent components identified in eems and molecular and isomeric complexity by ft icr ms and im tof lcms the storage period showed a relative elevation of terrestrial dom input with higher aromaticity and humification degree as well as molecular weight than the drainage period the significant variation of dom chemistry was mainly caused by hydrologic dynamic mode due to reservoir management in contrast to the temporal variation of dom chemistry spatial variation occurred only in the drainage period which is mainly resulted from hydrological gradient generated by water intrusion from the mainstream to the tributary we further suggest that the overall shift in dom chemistry between the drainage and storage periods and the increase of autochthonous input with the age of damming are linked with co2 emission in tgr and other young reservoirs with an increasing number of reservoirs to be built further constraining the influence of reservoir management induced dom dynamics would enhance our ability to predict and model the effects of reservoir dom on downstream systems and better constraining carbon cycle in inland

17489,microplastic mp pollution is an increasing global problem due to the ubiquity of these particles in the environment and the uncertainty surrounding their fate most mps undergo extensive weathering in the environment which may result in the release of dissolved organic matter dom into the aqueous phase in this study for the first time we examined the adsorptive behavior of mp derived dom mp dom on minerals kaolinite and goethite using dom samples leached from commercial plastics including polyvinylchloride pvc and polystyrene ps under dark and ultraviolet uv irradiation conditions mp dom was characterized by a higher distribution of relatively smaller sized molecules than natural organic matter nom the ps derived dom ps dom leached under uv treatment exhibited more oxygen containing groups than their counterparts in the dark mp dom also exhibited net negative charges at neutral ph ranges adsorption isotherm experiments revealed that the mineral surfaces had high adsorption affinities for both types of mp dom which is likely associated with both electrostatic attraction and ligand exchange the extent of adsorption was greater for the uv irradiated than the dark treated dom and on goethite compared to kaolinite the fourier transform infrared ftir spectra of the residual ps dom after adsorption revealed differences in the adsorption affinities between its functional groups two dimensional correlation spectroscopy for the irradiated ps dom showed that preferential adsorption occurred on minerals in the sequential order of oxidized structures ps monomers carboxylates in additives carbonyl groups the adsorption isotherm model parameters for mp dom were comparable to those obtained from aquatic terrestrial nom which suggests that plastic derived dom can interact with minerals as strongly as nom this study highlights the overlooked role played by plastic derived dom in mineral enriched environments opening new opportunities for improving our understanding of the fate and environmental impacts of mps graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics dissolved organic matter minerals adsorption two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2d cos 1 introduction owing to their rapidly increasing production and improper disposal micro sized plastic particles microplastics mps are considered a significant emerging risk in aquatic ecosystems he et al 2018 syberg et al 2015 in recent years terrestrial sedimentary environments contaminated with mps have also received tremendous research attention van cauwenberghe et al 2015 wang et al 2019 the uncertainties regarding the environmental fate of mps are amplified by the variety of their physical and chemical properties and the potential changes they undergo when subject to weathering processes such as ultraviolet uv irradiation and physical abrasion potthoff et al 2017 song et al 2020 on the one hand non floating debris e g polyvinyl chloride which has a higher density than water tends to accumulate on the deep seafloor and in soils and other sediments fuller and gautam 2016 on the other hand buoyant plastic materials with relatively low densities such as expanded polystyrene eps dekiff et al 2014 kwon et al 2015 which widely occur in beach sediments are likely to release dissolved organic matter dom under uv irradiation gewert et al 2018 these dissolved organic substances so called plastic derived dom typically contain several additives as well as oligomers and monomers that originally formed the main polymer chains of the plastic suhrhoff and scholz böttcher 2016 oxygen containing groups may also exist in the plastic derived intermediates produced from mps as a result of chemical modifications triggered by uv irradiation gewert et al 2018 the presence of diverse functional groups in mps plays a role in increasing the polarity of mp surfaces and promoting interactions between mps and environmental media or other pollutants liu et al 2019 wang et al 2020 it is well known that natural organic matter nom molecules tend to be attached to mineral surfaces which is driven by several adsorption mechanisms including hydrophobic interaction electrostatic attraction and ligand exchange kleber et al 2007 nom adsorption can modify the surface properties and reactivity of minerals conte et al 2011 księżopolska and pazur 2011 for example numerous studies have shown that fractions with higher molecular weight and or more acidic functional groups within the bulk nom exhibit greater adsorption affinity towards minerals hur and schlautman 2003 tremblay and gagné 2009 recent studies on mp derived dom mp dom have underscored the possible substantial production of these substances in aquatic environments and their significant environmental impacts which are comparable to the effects of nom in terms of bioavailability and as serve as disinfection byproduct precursors lee et al 2020 romera castillo et al 2018 in view of the well established phenomenon of nom interaction with mineral surfaces and the environmental behavioral similarity between mp dom and nom whether or not the adsorptive affinity of mp dom towards mineral surfaces is similar to the documented behavior of nom remains unknown despite having significant environmental implications several previous studies have shown that mp dom can be better described as a heterogeneous mixture consisting of different organic substances than as a simple aggregate of several similar polymer molecules gewert et al 2018 thus it follows that the adsorption behavior of mp dom is likely to be complicated as it is composed of heterogeneous structures this complication can be resolved by employing two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2d cos an advanced dom characterization tool that captures the dynamic relationships between different spectral variables under an applied external factor the 2d cos technique reveals the sequential order of spectral changes in response to an external perturbation e g adsorption at high resolution the spectral variables used in 2d cos are mostly based on fluorescence spectroscopy hur and lee 2011 wang et al 2017 or fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir jin et al 2018 lee and hur 2016 for example yang et al 2019 used 2d cos combined with ftir 2d coir to demonstrate the preferential adsorption of a particular functional group within bulk fulvic acid on iron oxides since ftir has been widely used to identify the polymeric composition of mps jung et al 2018 and mp dom lee et al 2020 it is very likely that 2d coir can help to unravel the hypothesized complex adsorptive behavior of mp dom on minerals considering the increasing recognition and concern for the release of mp dom into aquatic and terrestrial environments and the need to understand the interactions between mp dom and minerals this study is specifically aimed to 1 characterize mp dom generated under two different leaching

describe mp dom adsorption on two common minerals kaolinite and goethite via commonly used isotherm and kinetic models 3 apply 2d coir to further elucidate the complex adsorption behaviors and 4 compare the adsorption behaviors of mp dom with those of other aquatic and terrestrial nom 2 materials and methods 2 1 microplastics and minerals polyvinylchloride pvc and expanded polystyrene ps were selected as representative plastics in particular ps was selected as it is expected to exhibit a high adsorption affinity to mineral surfaces due to the presence of benzene ring groups in its structure balcke et al 2002 commercial plastics were purchased from a local market in the form of plates 1 mm thickness in seoul south korea these were subsequently cut into 1 mm 1 mm pieces and washed with distilled water to remove any impurities that might have been present as a result of sample handling kaolinite and goethite powders were purchased from sigma aldrich and used as received the point of zero charge pzc of goethite was previously reported as being close to 9 0 bakatula et al 2018 zhong et al 2015 kaolinite has a pzc of 3 0 for the overall surface and 7 3 for the surface edges while retaining a high number of dom adsorption reactive sites e g hydroxyl groups murphy et al 1990 nitrogen bet measurements for the minerals revealed that the specific surface areas were 11 6 m2 g for kaolinite wang et al 2011 and 76 1 m2 g for goethite tang et al 2010 2 2 mp dom leaching experiments leaching experiments were conducted in an artificial freshwater solution containing 5 0 g l plastic pieces under two different experimental conditions dark and uv irradiation the effect of uv irradiation was only examined for the buoyant ps material because this plastic is more likely to be impacted by sunlight than non floating pvc particles the leaching process lasted for 14 days and the plastic doses expressed in mass per water volume were selected based on suhrhoff and scholz böttcher 2016 as one of the main goals of this study was to characterize the adsorptive behavior of mp dom higher mp doses were intentionally selected relative to naturally occurring concentrations alimi et al 2018 chae and an 2018 the leaching solution was similar to freshwater in its ion composition consisting of nahco3 96 mg l caso4 47 4 mg l mgso4 7h2o 122 86 mg l and kcl 4 mg l majedi et al 2014 the prepared mp pieces were added to the artificial freshwater solution 2 l in a sterilized amber glass bottle during the 14 day leaching test the glass bottles were placed on a shaker at 150 rpm in the dark the 14 day leaching time was sufficient to obtain significant amounts of mp dom for the adsorption experiments changes in doc concentrations during the leaching period are shown in fig s1 for uv irradiation the freshwater solutions containing the ps pieces were transferred to quartz tubes that had previously been autoclaved at 120 c for 15 min the tubes were placed in the center of a closed cabinet with six 8w uva lamps sankyo denki f8t5bl as the light source lee et al 2020 a stirrer was placed at the bottom of each tube to maintain continuous mixing throughout the leaching tests at the end of the leaching the mixing solutions were filtered through pre washed whatman gf f filters to obtain the mp dom samples for filtration a glassware vacuum filtration device was used instead of a syringe filter to prevent any contact between the solution and other plastic materials irrespective of the leaching conditions the final ph of the mp dom after filtration was between 5 8 and 6 5 i e the neutral ph range after the 14 day leaching the concentrations of mp dom were 2 24 0 25 mg c l for pvc dom and 0 60 0 012 mg c l for ps dom under dark conditions and 15 17 0 33 mg c l under uv irradiation conditions fig 1 c for the adsorption experiments the ps dom obtained in the dark was concentrated ten fold using a rotary evaporator at 30 c giving a concentration of 6 23 0 18 mg c l for representative nom materials elliott soil humic acid esha and suwanee river fulvic acid srfa were obtained from the international humic substances society ihss the nom stock solutions were prepared by dissolving 100 mg of the powder in 1 l of milli q water 68 3 mg c l for srfa and 55 4 mg c l for esha diluted to approximately 15 mg c l to match the ps dom prepared under uv irradiation 2 3 mineral adsorption isotherms and kinetic experiments adsorption isotherm experiments were conducted in a 0 01 m nacl solution containing each mineral as an adsorbent to account for the large difference in surface areas between the two minerals a lower goethite dose 0 09 2 5 g l was used than for kaolinite 0 55 15 g l ensuring a similar surface area per unit mass as the ps dom the resulting surface areas ranged from 6 4 to 174 m2 l for kaolinite and from 6 9 to 190 m2 l for goethite the initial mp dom concentrations and the mineral doses were varied to meet the target ranges i e 0 01 4 00 mg c per gram of kaolinite and 0 08 24 00 mg c per gram of goethite table s1 before the adsorption experiments the ph of the solutions was adjusted to 7 0 using 1 m hcl or naoh the mineral suspension solutions containing mp dom were transferred into autoclaved 120 c for 15 min glass amber vials 40 ml with teflon screw caps the vials were placed on a reciprocating shaker for 24 h to equilibrate at room temperature in the dark no substantial change in ph was observed during the mixing which deviated by 0 3 from the original value i e 7 0 all experiments were performed in triplicate mineral suspensions without mp dom were used as controls for the final concentrations of mp dom in the aqueous phase table s2 after apparent equilibrium was reached all suspensions were filtered through 0 2 μm pre washed cellulose acetate filters advantec to obtain the residual mp dom samples detailed experimental conditions are summarized in table s1 adsorption kinetics experiments were conducted in batches using the maximum mp dom to mineral mass ratios i e 4 mg c g kaolinite and 24 mg c g goethite the general procedure was similar to previous equilibrium isotherm experiments the samples were sacrificed when the designated mixing times were reached at ten points for ps dom and five points for pvc dom to further investigate the effect of nom on the adsorptive behavior of mp dom adsorption equilibrium experiments were conducted using mixtures of uv irradiated ps dom and nom at different mixing ratios the initial ps dom was fixed at 12 mg c l and the dom to mineral ratio was set at 24 mg c g adsorption isotherm parameters were estimated by fitting the experimental data to two well known adsorption isotherm models namely the langmuir model 1 and the freundlich model 2 1 q e q m a x k l c e 1 k l c e 2 q e k f c e 1 n where qe and qmax represent the amount of solute i e ps dom adsorbed and the maximum adsorption capacity at equilibrium respectively ce is the equilibrium concentration of ps dom in the aqueous phase kl is the adsorption affinity related to the adsorption energy kf and 1 n represents the freundlich adsorption capacity factor and the model site heterogeneity factor or an indicator of isotherm nonlinearity respectively the parameters for the adsorption kinetics were estimated using a pseudo first order kinetic model 3 3 q t 1 e k t t where qt and qe are the adsorbed amounts of mp dom after adsorption at time point t and at equilibrium respectively and kt 1 h refers to the pseudo first order model constant where t is the adsorption time 2 4 analytical measurements 2 4 1 doc measurement doc concentrations in the residual ps dom after adsorption were determined using a toc analyzer shimadzu l series tocchp japan the solutions for doc analyses were collected in pre combusted 40 ml glass vials acidified with 1 m hcl solution to attain a ph of 2 0 and stored at 4 c until measured a standard stock solution was also prepared for doc measurements using potassium hydrogen phthalate which was tested daily to check the accuracy of the toc analyzer 2 for a doc concentration of 0 5 mg l 2 4 2 ftir spectroscopy zeta potentials and elemental composition ftir nicolet is10 thermo scientific was used to identify the different functional groups contained in the mp dom samples following published protocols chen et al 2018 briefly 10 ml of the filtered mp dom sample was mixed with 100 mg of kbr powder sigma aldrich ft ir grade and freeze dried for further analysis as a blank clean kbr pellets were prepared through a drying step at 105 c for 2 h the scanned wavenumber ranged from 650 cm 1 to 4000 cm 1 each ftir spectrum was corrected for baseline shifts and smoothed using origin 9 0 software 12 points savitzky golay method the ftir peak intensities were normalized by the summed intensities of all the observed peaks yang et al 2015 the ftir measurements of two separately prepared samples resulted in consistent spectral features fig s2 a zeta potential meter litesizer 500 anton paar was used to measure the zeta potentials of the ps dom samples the ps dom solutions were adjusted to four different ph values ph 3 5 7 and 9 using a 0 1 m naoh or hcl solution the variation in ph was minimal during the measurements with deviations of 0 3 from the initial values the elemental compositions i e chons contents of the mp dom samples which were concentrated using a nitrogen rotary evaporator were determined using an elemental analyzer thermo scientific flash 2000 2 4 3 determination of dom molecular size distributions different size fractions for dom samples were quantified using a high performance liquid chromatography system s 100 knauer berlin germany equipped with an organic carbon detector ocd and a size exclusion column 250 mm 20 mm tsk hw 50s the detailed analytical procedure is described elsewhere chen et al 2016 huber et al 2011 the assignment and quantification of five different size fractions which included biopolymer bp humic substances hs building blocks bb low molecular weight acids lmwa and low molecular weight neutrals lmwn were made based on established procedures huber et al 2011 and in built software the sec measurements were performed on one representative sample out of the three replicates 2 4 4 two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2d cos 2d cos was applied to capture any sequential changes occurring in the ftir spectra of the ps dom during adsorption increasing adsorption percentages or increasing adsorption sites on a mineral were set as an external perturbation for the 2d cos synchronous syn and asynchronous asyn maps were generated by employing the 2dshige freeware https sites google com site shigemorita home 2dshige on the one hand the auto peak intensities which are located on the diagonal lines of the syn maps represent the degrees of the overall spectral changes induced by the external perturbation on the other hand the cross peaks positioned off of the diagonal lines in the syn maps reveal the different directions of the changes sequential order was determined by comparing the signs of the peaks in the syn and asyn maps and by applying the noda s rule mcclure et al 1996 yan et al 2013 if the signs of the peaks are the same on both syn and asyn maps the changes at the x axis precede those at the y axis if the signs are different the sequence of the change is reversed with respect to the coordinates i e noda s rule the detailed mathematical expressions for the two spectra are as follows noda et al 2000 3 3 v 1 v 2 1 t m a x t m i n t m i n t

and an external perturbation respectively y v t is the dynamic spectrum and z v t is the hilbert transformed orthogonal spectrum 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of ps dom 3 1 1 functional groups ftir has been widely used as a simple efficient and nondestructive method for identifying the different compositions of plastic polymers jung et al 2018 the two plastics used in this study exhibited several distinctive peaks in their ftir spectra peaks a at 690 760 cm 1 b at 1360 1460 cm 1 c at 1490 1500 cm 1 d at 2840 2930 cm 1 and e at 3020 3030 cm 1 were observed for the ps material the pvc particles showed peaks at 960 970 cm 1 peak i 1100 cm 1 peak iii 1250 1265 cm 1 peak iv 1420 1460 cm 1 peak v and 2830 2960 cm 1 peak viii fig 1a 1b and table s3 among the identified peaks ps peaks b and d and pvc peaks v and viii indicate carbon chains with repeated ch2 units which have been commonly observed in other plastics including polyethylene pe and polypropylene pp table s3 peaks a c and e which were exclusively observed in the ps are related to benzene rings table s3 interestingly some peaks of the plastic particles did not appear in the ftir spectra of the leached dom samples for example peaks a c and e which are unique to ps were not observed in the ps dom spectra fig 1a similar observations have been reported in the study of plastic derived dom using pe and pp plastic polymers lee et al 2020 in addition the leached dom exhibited several spectral peaks that were not originally observed in particle spectra for example peak g and peak vii which are related to the carboxylates used as additives in plastics were observed only in the spectra of dom leached from the ps and pvc respectively similarly peaks h and viii and peak vi represent the plastic monomers and bisphenol a in pvc respectively for the uv irradiated ps dom i e the ps dom leached under uv irradiation additional peaks were observed at 1742 cm 1 peak f and 1169 cm 1 peak i these two peaks were previously reported for oxidized polymers gugumus 1999 lucki and rånby 1979 which can be linked to oxygen containing groups generated during uv irradiation table s3 the ftir results of the irradiated ps dom are in line with mass spectroscopy observations gewert et al 2018 which indicates the release of styrene monomers containing carboxylic groups into the aqueous phase from ps plastic when was exposed to uv light liu et al 2020 also documented the presence of oxygen containing groups in the leachate of mp during the weathering process 3 1 2 leached amounts and molecular size distribution of ps dom for the dark condition the concentrations of doc released per gram of pvc were nearly four times higher than those of ps 0 45 0 05 mg c g pvc compared to 0 12 0 01 mg c g ps fig 1c this suggests that the amounts of leached doc might be highly dependent upon plastic type this is consistent with the findings of suhrhoff and scholz böttcher 2016 who reported that pvc typically contains high additive loads and is more vulnerable in the aqueous phase than ps furthermore the leached quantities of ps dom per mass of ps were nearly 25 times higher for the uv irradiated samples than for the dark treated samples 3 30 0 33 mg c g ps compared to 0 12 0 01 mg c g ps fig 1c these results indicate that uv irradiation induced the structures of ps to become more vulnerable to dissolution the leached amount under uv irradiation was on average equivalent to nearly 0 3 of the total mass of the added ps it is likely that ps is susceptible to photo degradation as its phenyl rings are easily excited by uv light similar structural instability of ps under uv light was reported by song et al 2017 who found a significant difference in the number of fragmented plastic particles with and without a six month period of uv irradiation 12 152 3276 particles pellets compared to 4220 33 particles pellets respectively five different size fractions bp hs bb lmwa and lmwn were identified in the mp dom samples produced either in the dark or under uv light fig 1d irrespective of the experimental conditions the lmwn 350 da fraction was found to be dominant constituting 67 4 79 3 of the bulk mp dom this contrasted the typical make up of the aquatic nom which was characterized by a much lower distribution of lmwn esha 18 0 and srfa 12 2 fig s3 relative to the larger sized hs and bp fractions it is possible that mps release oligomers with low molecular weights into the aqueous phase during the weathering process as a result of polymer chain scission gewert et al 2018 this mechanism is also supported by the existence of high levels of styrene oligomers up to 31 400 μg kg in beach sands around the world kwon et al 2015 furthermore the relatively higher abundance of the lmwn fraction in the irradiated 79 3 versus dark treated ps dom 67 4 was notable which can be ascribed in part to a higher production of this fraction under uv irradiation and or to the photo degradation of the lmwa or bb fractions similar observations have been previously reported lee et al 2020 which may be taken to demonstrate that the relative abundance of the lmwn fraction of plastic polymer derived dom increases with longer exposure to irradiation whereas larger sized fractions decreased 3 1 3 zeta potentials and elemental composition the net charge characteristics of dom at varying solution ph which are typically estimated by zeta potential measurements provide mechanistic insights into dom adsorption behavior on mineral surfaces rahman et al 2013 in this study the zeta potentials of mp dom were measured over a ph range of 3 0 to 9 0 fig 1e similar to typical aquatic and terrestrial nom kloster et al 2013 saab et al 2010 all the mp dom samples exhibited negative zeta potentials at ph values above 3 0 in addition there were notable differences in the charge characteristics of the two ps dom samples i e dark versus uv treated samples at any given ph in comparison to the dark treated samples uv irradiated ps dom was more negatively charged for example at ph 7 the zeta potentials of the dark treated and the light treated ps dom samples were 3 32 mv and 20 79 mv respectively this can be explained by the acidic effect of the carboxylic group containing photolytic byproducts produced under uv irradiation this is consistent with observations that humic acid with more abundant carboxylic groups is more negatively charged than fulvic acid liang et al 2011 the more negatively charged ps dom can be more favorably adsorbed onto minerals with a net positive surface charge via electrostatic attraction while adsorption is unfavorable if the mineral has a net negative surface charge due to electrostatic repulsion considering the pzcs of the two minerals it can be inferred that the uv irradiated ps dom will adsorb more readily onto goethite than the dark treated ps dom however the difference in adsorptive affinity may be less pronounced for kaolinite fig 1e the atomic ratios h c and o c obtained from the elemental analyses of mp dom are presented in fig 1f and table s4 in general all of the mp dom samples presented higher h c and o c ratios than those of srfa and esha 0 95 1 10 compared to 0 06 0 08 for h c and 1 36 1 48 compared to 0 59 0 80 for o c respectively a lower h c atomic ratio has been interpreted as being indicative of abundant aromatic structures in organic matter thurman 2012 the o c ratio of the uv irradiated ps dom was higher than that of the dark treated counterpart i e 1 48 compared to 1 36 which can be attributed to the production of oxygen containing carbon structures under the stimulating effect of uv irradiation these results are in line with previous observations gewert et al 2018 made using mass spectroscopy to detect the occurrence of oxidized end groups in the aqueous phase when commercial plastics were exposed to uv light 3 2 adsorption behavior of ps dom onto minerals 3 2 1 adsorption isotherms the adsorption isotherms of mp dom are shown in fig 2 and the related model parameters are listed in table 1 the r2 values of the langmuir and freundlich models were all high r2 0 94 suggesting that the two isotherm models reasonably explained the adsorption behaviors of mp dom although the adsorption behavior at equilibrium was well described it should be noted that the langmuir model parameters are theoretically constrained by several assumptions including monolayer adsorption and homogeneous surfaces wang and wang 2018 whereas the freundlich model assumes adsorbents have a heterogeneous surface and applies to both monolayer and multilayer sorption foo and hameed 2010 wu et al 2019 it was observed that substantial amounts of mp dom up to 94 4 for the dark treated dom and 95 2 for the uv irradiated dom were adsorbed onto both minerals table s1 furthermore for each type of mp dom the extent of adsorption was greater on goethite than on kaolinite for example the surface area normalized maximum adsorption capacity qmax of the dark treated pvc dom on goethite 1298 136 mg c cm2 was nearly four times higher than that on kaolinite 323 15 mg c cm2 these observed differences can be attributed to the greater abundance of positive surface charges on goethite relative to kaolinite at ph 7 which is favorable for the adsorption of negatively charged pvc dom particularly the irradiated ps dom via electrostatic attraction hur and schlautman 2003 murphy et al 1990 the distribution of hydroxyl groups on kaolinite which are primarily concentrated on kaolinite edges huertas et al 1998 sutheimer et al 1999 possibly plays a role in the lower surface normalized qmax value of kaolinite compared to goethite for the same mineral the adsorption affinity kf was much higher for the irradiated dom than the dark treated dom the kf value of the irradiated dom was 907 37 mg c cm2 l mg 1 n on goethite compared to 376 21 mg c cm2 l mg 1 n for the dark treated dom table 1 the higher adsorption affinity of the irradiated ps dom implies that the dissolved photolytic byproducts from ps plastic are favorably adsorbed onto minerals this is supported by the observation that irradiated ps dom was more negatively charged than the dark treated ps dom therefore these results further indicate that electrostatic attraction might be the dominant mechanism controlling the adsorption of ps dom onto the selected minerals however electrostatic attraction alone cannot explain all the adsorption phenomena as this is not likely to have been actively operating in the kaolinite adsorption experiments given the relatively low pzc at ph 7 of the mineral surfaces and edges furthermore enhanced adsorption onto the irradiated versus dark treated ps dom was still observed for kaolinite even though the irradiated samples exhibited a more negative charge among the commonly cited adsorption mechanisms that could exist between dom and minerals hydrophobic interactions are not likely to dominate in this case as kaolinite adsorbed proportionally less of the dark treated ps dom fig 2a which has a relatively large molecular size fig 1d ligand exchange is a more likely candidate that could explain the adsorption of ps dom onto kaolinite in the context of this study ligand exchange involves the binding of anions in the aqueous phase with surface hydroxyl layers of minerals zhang et al 2012 the anionic e g carboxyl groups of ps dom as revealed by the previously discussed ftir spectroscopy may play an important role in the ligand exchange driven interaction with the hydroxyl groups on the surfaces or edges of kaolinite the 1 n values from the freundlich model were well below 1 0 this indicates that the available adsorption sites are limited to both minerals and that competition exists among the different mp dom constituents furthermore the n value was consistently lower for the irradiated ps dom 0 58 for kaolinite and 0 52 for goethite than the dark treated ps dom 0 61 for kaolinite and 0 58 for goethite this suggests that the competition for adsorption sites would be stronger for the irradiated ps dom probably because of its heterogeneous composition in comparison with the dark treated dom 3 2 2 adsorption kinetics the adsorption kinetic parameters based on the doc concentrations are presented in table 1 irrespective of the leaching conditions the apparent equilibrium for all the mp doms was reached within 24 h fig 2 the equilibrium concentration qe and the adsorption rate kt for the irradiated and the dark treated ps dom which were estimated by the pseudo first order model were different for example the mean values of qe and kt on goethite were approximately 2 5 and 1 4 times higher for the irradiated than for the dark treated samples respectively this can be ascribed to the differences in the net charge of the two ps dom samples this may also be explained in part by the smaller molecular size of the irradiated ps dom as smaller molecules are likely to be favored during the fast initial adsorption process due to their higher rate of diffusion kilduff et al 1996 3 2 3 effects of solution ph and nom the effect of solution ph on the adsorption of mp dom was examined by varying the doc adsorption rate over a ph range of 3 to 9 fig s4 for both minerals the adsorption of mp dom was highly ph dependent with greater adsorption observed at lower ph this may be explained by a greater contribution of site dependent sorption processes at lower ph including electrostatic attraction and ligand exchange hur and schlautman 2004 weng et al 2007 the ph effect was more pronounced on goethite than on kaolinite over the investigated ph range for example the doc adsorption rates of the dark treated ps dom varied from 20 5 to 50 6 on goethite compared to 6 1 to 24 1 on kaolinite this can be ascribed to the differences in the pzc of the two minerals and the general tendency for a dramatic change in doc adsorption around the mineral pzc value avena and koopal 1999 to examine the effect of nom on the adsorption of mp dom adsorption rates were compared using mixtures consisting of uv irradiated ps dom and nom srfa and esha at different mixing ratios on the basis of doc i e ps dom nom 10 0 9 1 7 5 2 5 5 5 and 0 10 fig s5 the adsorption rates showed increasing trends with a higher abundance of nom in the mixtures the relative differences in the adsorption rates between the mixtures without nom i e pure ps dom versus those with 100 nom were approximately 4 2 for srfa and 20 3 for esha these results suggest that competitive adsorption between mp dom and nom occurs towards the mineral surfaces and that adsorption may be more preferable for nom than for mp dom the nom effect appears to be more pronounced for esha than for srha and although the effect resulting from competitive adsorption was observed quantitative distinction between mp dom and nom is required to properly delineate the competitive adsorption behavior between the two types of dom i e mp dom and nom 3 3 change in ftir spectra with adsorption to obtain more detailed information regarding the sequential structural changes of mp dom during adsorption ps dom was chosen as a representative mp dom and a series of ftir spectra of the residual dom after adsorption were incorporated into 2d cos i e 2d coir irrespective of the leaching conditions the ftir peaks identified in the original ps dom spectra were all observed in the sample spectra after adsorption i e peaks b g h and d for the dark treated dom and peaks i b g h f and d for the uv irradiated dom the peak intensities decreased with increasing adsorbed amounts or increasing adsorption sites although the magnitude of the decrease varied fig 3 the results suggest that all the ps dom structures related to the identified ftir peaks participated in the adsorption the ftir peaks that changed more may be linked to ps dom structures with stronger adsorption affinities for the mineral surfaces on the diagonal lines of the syn maps figs 4 a and 4b for goethite and figs s6a and s6b for kaolinite several distinctive peaks were observed for both the dark treated dom peaks g b and h and uv irradiated dom peaks i g h f and d the negative signs of the peaks indicated that with increasing amounts adsorbed the corresponding changes occurred in such a way as to lower the peak intensities the asyn map revealed additional information regarding the sequential changes in ftir spectra in response to increasing adsorbed ps dom amounts or adsorption sites on the minerals for example for the dark treated dom on goethite the h g peak x axis y axis displayed a negative sign as well as a negative sign at the same location on the syn map fig 4c following noda s rules hur and lee 2011 noda et al 2000 for the dark treated sample the adsorption of different ps dom structures on goethite was in the order of monomers peak h carboxylates in additives peak g similarly the adsorption of the dark treated dom on kaolinite can be interpreted to occur in the order of peak h peak g peak b a common plastic unique peak these results suggest that the leached monomers preferentially adsorbed over the additives table s3 for the irradiated ps dom on goethite positively signed cross peaks were observed at the g i h i f i g f and h f peaks below the diagonal of the asyn map and the corresponding locations were all negative on the syn map figs 3c and 3d fig s6 and tables s4 and s5 based on these observations as adsorption progressed corresponding changes occurred in the order of peak i peak h peak g peak f the peak assignments table s3 further revealed that the adsorption of the irradiated ps dom had a preferential order of oxidized structures monomers carboxylates in additives carbonyl groups except for the absence of peak h no differences were found in the sequential adsorption of different functional groups between the two minerals this implies that the absorption of oxidized byproducts was favored over the adsorption of polymer derived substances and additives the sequence of adsorption on the minerals for the different ps dom structures is consistent with the proposition that electrostatic attraction was the main adsorption mechanism 3 4 comparison of adsorption behaviors between ps dom and nom and environmental implications the adsorption affinities for goethite kl and kf of the three types of mp dom were compared with previously published nom data table 2 which are comparable under similar environmental conditions for example the adsorption affinity parameters of the dark treated mp dom pvc dom and ps dom fitted by the langmuir isotherm model kl fall within the range of 0 07 l mg c to 0 62 l mg c as previously reported for aquatic nom kaiser 2003 tipping 1981 wang et al 1997 it is notable that previous nom adsorption studies have used humic substances humic acid or fulvic acid as major constituents of nom which are limited as proxies for the whole composition of nom humic substances contain large aromatic structures enriched with acidic functional groups and as such are favorably adsorbed onto minerals in this context it is likely that bulk nom might have a lower adsorption affinity than humic substances consequently the interaction between mp dom and mineral surfaces could be even stronger than the interaction between these surfaces and whole nom it was previously reported that plastic additives such as bisphenol a and dibutyl phthalate which are often added during the manufacture of several types of plastics suhrhoff and scholz böttcher 2016 show strong adsorption tendencies toward mineral surfaces koduru et al 2016 xu and li 2008 given that additives are one of the major constituents of commercial plastics it is not surprising that the adsorption behaviors of the additives were similar to those of mp dom table 2 carboxylic groups have been detected in uv irradiated plastics including pe pp and pet gewert et al 2018 thus the abundance of acidic functional groups in plastic derived dom favors adsorption onto minerals taken together these results demonstrate that the interactions between plastic derived dom and minerals could be as strong as those between minerals and nom therefore in mp contaminated environments there may be competition between nom and plastic derived dom for adsorption sites on mineral surfaces which may also disturb the equilibria previously established between nom and minerals which may interfere with the fate and transport of nom in subsurface systems to extend and generalize the novel findings in this work further adsorption experiments using other plastic derived dom samples and inorganic minerals are recommended competitive adsorption experiments between nom and mp dom on minerals are also required to gain a better understanding of the interactions between dom and mineral surfaces in mp polluted environments this would help clarify the pertinent underlying mechanisms responsible for the adsorption of plastic derived dom onto minerals and the environmental fate of these organic substances in mineral enriched environments 4 conclusions this study has provided the first report of the adsorptive behavior of plastic derived dom on minerals based on the results the following key conclusions can be drawn 1 mp dom exhibited a high adsorption affinity toward mineral surfaces the extent of adsorption was greater for uv irradiated than dark treated ps dom the extent and affinity of adsorption were higher for goethite than kaolinite the adsorption behaviors were well explained by electrostatic attraction and ligand exchange irradiated ps dom which contains more oxygen containing groups than dark treated dom was more favorably adsorbed onto the minerals 2 the 2d coir maps of the irradiated ps dom revealed that oxidized structures were favorably adsorbed over monomer related structures and additives the sequence of preferential adsorption for the different functional groups in the ps dom was consistent with the dominant adsorption mechanisms operative in the system 3 the adsorption isotherm model parameters of the mp dom were comparable to those obtained from aquatic and terrestrial nom which suggests that plastic derived dom can play a critical role in modifying mineral surfaces in mp contaminated environments for the first time these results reveal the strong affinity of plastic derived dom towards mineral surfaces thus the interaction of plastic derived dom and minerals should be taken into account if a full understanding of the fate and the environmental consequences of plastic derived dom in mp polluted and mineral enriched environments is to be attained declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements this work was supported by grants from the national research foundation of korea nrf as funded by the korean government

17489,microplastic mp pollution is an increasing global problem due to the ubiquity of these particles in the environment and the uncertainty surrounding their fate most mps undergo extensive weathering in the environment which may result in the release of dissolved organic matter dom into the aqueous phase in this study for the first time we examined the adsorptive behavior of mp derived dom mp dom on minerals kaolinite and goethite using dom samples leached from commercial plastics including polyvinylchloride pvc and polystyrene ps under dark and ultraviolet uv irradiation conditions mp dom was characterized by a higher distribution of relatively smaller sized molecules than natural organic matter nom the ps derived dom ps dom leached under uv treatment exhibited more oxygen containing groups than their counterparts in the dark mp dom also exhibited net negative charges at neutral ph ranges adsorption isotherm experiments revealed that the mineral surfaces had high adsorption affinities for both types of mp dom which is likely associated with both electrostatic attraction and ligand exchange the extent of adsorption was greater for the uv irradiated than the dark treated dom and on goethite compared to kaolinite the fourier transform infrared ftir spectra of the residual ps dom after adsorption revealed differences in the adsorption affinities between its functional groups two dimensional correlation spectroscopy for the irradiated ps dom showed that preferential adsorption occurred on minerals in the sequential order of oxidized structures ps monomers carboxylates in additives carbonyl groups the adsorption isotherm model parameters for mp dom were comparable to those obtained from aquatic terrestrial nom which suggests that plastic derived dom can interact with minerals as strongly as nom this study highlights the overlooked role played by plastic derived dom in mineral enriched environments opening new opportunities for improving our

aquatic ecosystems he et al 2018 syberg et al 2015 in recent years terrestrial sedimentary environments contaminated with mps have also received tremendous research attention van cauwenberghe et al 2015 wang et al 2019 the uncertainties regarding the environmental fate of mps are amplified by the variety of their physical and chemical properties and the potential changes they undergo when subject to weathering processes such as ultraviolet uv irradiation and physical abrasion potthoff et al 2017 song et al 2020 on the one hand non floating debris e g polyvinyl chloride which has a higher density than water tends to accumulate on the deep seafloor and in soils and other sediments fuller and gautam 2016 on the other hand buoyant plastic materials with relatively low densities such as expanded polystyrene eps dekiff et al 2014 kwon et al 2015 which widely occur in beach sediments are likely to release dissolved organic matter dom under uv irradiation gewert et al 2018 these dissolved organic substances so called plastic derived dom typically contain several additives as well as oligomers and monomers that originally formed the main polymer chains of the plastic suhrhoff and scholz böttcher 2016 oxygen containing groups may also exist in the plastic derived intermediates produced from mps as a result of chemical modifications triggered by uv irradiation gewert et al 2018 the presence of diverse functional groups in mps plays a role in increasing the polarity of mp surfaces and promoting interactions between mps and environmental media or other pollutants liu et al 2019 wang et al 2020 it is well known that natural organic matter nom molecules tend to be attached to mineral surfaces which is driven by several adsorption mechanisms including hydrophobic interaction electrostatic attraction and ligand exchange kleber et al 2007 nom adsorption can modify the surface properties and reactivity of minerals conte et al 2011 księżopolska and pazur 2011 for example numerous studies have shown that fractions with higher molecular weight and or more acidic functional groups within the bulk nom exhibit greater adsorption affinity towards minerals hur and schlautman 2003 tremblay and gagné 2009 recent studies on mp derived dom mp dom have underscored the possible substantial production of these substances in aquatic environments and their significant environmental impacts which are comparable to the effects of nom in terms of bioavailability and as serve as disinfection byproduct precursors lee et al 2020 romera castillo et al 2018 in view of the well established phenomenon of nom interaction with mineral surfaces and the environmental behavioral similarity between mp dom and nom whether or not the adsorptive affinity of mp dom towards mineral surfaces is similar to the documented behavior of nom remains unknown despite having significant environmental implications several previous studies have shown that mp dom can be better described as a heterogeneous mixture consisting of different organic substances than as a simple aggregate of several similar polymer molecules gewert et al 2018 thus it follows that the adsorption behavior of mp dom is likely to be complicated as it is composed of heterogeneous structures this complication can be resolved by employing two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2d cos an advanced dom characterization tool that captures the dynamic relationships between different spectral variables under an applied external factor the 2d cos technique reveals the sequential order of spectral changes in response to an external perturbation e g adsorption at high resolution the spectral variables used in 2d cos are mostly based on fluorescence spectroscopy hur and lee 2011 wang et al 2017 or fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir jin et al 2018 lee and hur 2016 for example yang et al 2019 used 2d cos combined with ftir 2d coir to demonstrate the preferential adsorption of a particular functional group within bulk fulvic acid on iron oxides since ftir has been widely used to identify the polymeric composition of mps jung et al 2018 and mp dom lee et al 2020 it is very likely that 2d coir can help to unravel the hypothesized complex adsorptive behavior of mp dom on minerals considering the increasing recognition and concern for the release of mp dom into aquatic and terrestrial environments and the need to understand the interactions between mp dom and minerals this study is specifically aimed to 1 characterize mp dom generated under two different leaching

describe mp dom adsorption on two common minerals kaolinite and goethite via commonly used isotherm and kinetic models 3 apply 2d coir to further elucidate the complex adsorption behaviors and 4 compare the adsorption behaviors of mp dom with those of other aquatic and terrestrial nom 2 materials and methods 2 1 microplastics and minerals polyvinylchloride pvc and expanded polystyrene ps were selected as representative plastics in particular ps was selected as it is expected to exhibit a high adsorption affinity to mineral surfaces due to the presence of benzene ring groups in its structure balcke et al 2002 commercial plastics were purchased from a local market in the form of plates 1 mm thickness in seoul south korea these were subsequently cut into 1 mm 1 mm pieces and washed with distilled water to remove any impurities that might have been present as a result of sample handling kaolinite and goethite powders were purchased from sigma aldrich and used as received the point of zero charge pzc of goethite was previously reported as being close to 9 0 bakatula et al 2018 zhong et al 2015 kaolinite has a pzc of 3 0 for the overall surface and 7 3 for the surface edges while retaining a high number of dom adsorption reactive sites e g hydroxyl groups murphy et al 1990 nitrogen bet measurements for the minerals revealed that the specific surface areas were 11 6 m2 g for kaolinite wang et al 2011 and 76 1 m2 g for goethite tang et al 2010 2 2 mp dom leaching experiments leaching experiments were conducted in an artificial freshwater solution containing 5 0 g l plastic pieces under two different experimental conditions dark and uv irradiation the effect of uv irradiation was only examined for the buoyant ps material because this plastic is more likely to be impacted by sunlight than non floating pvc particles the leaching process lasted for 14 days and the plastic doses expressed in mass per water volume were selected based on suhrhoff and scholz böttcher 2016 as one of the main goals of this study was to characterize the adsorptive behavior of mp dom higher mp doses were intentionally selected relative to naturally occurring concentrations alimi et al 2018 chae and an 2018 the leaching solution was similar to freshwater in its ion composition consisting of nahco3 96 mg l caso4 47 4 mg l mgso4 7h2o 122 86 mg l and kcl 4 mg l majedi et al 2014 the prepared mp pieces were added to the artificial freshwater solution 2 l in a sterilized amber glass bottle during the 14 day leaching test the glass bottles were placed on a shaker at 150 rpm in the dark the 14 day leaching time was sufficient to obtain significant amounts of mp dom for the adsorption experiments changes in doc concentrations during the leaching period are shown in fig s1 for uv irradiation the freshwater solutions containing the ps pieces were transferred to quartz tubes that had previously been autoclaved at 120 c for 15 min the tubes were placed in the center of a closed cabinet with six 8w uva lamps sankyo denki f8t5bl as the light source lee et al 2020 a stirrer was placed at the bottom of each tube to maintain continuous mixing throughout the leaching tests at the end of the leaching the mixing solutions were filtered through pre washed whatman gf f filters to obtain the mp dom samples for filtration a glassware vacuum filtration device was used instead of a syringe filter to prevent any contact between the solution and other plastic materials irrespective of the leaching conditions the final ph of the mp dom after filtration was between 5 8 and 6 5 i e the neutral ph range after the 14 day leaching the concentrations of mp dom were 2 24 0 25 mg c l for pvc dom and 0 60 0 012 mg c l for ps dom under dark conditions and 15 17 0 33 mg c l under uv irradiation conditions fig 1 c for the adsorption experiments the ps dom obtained in the dark was concentrated ten fold using a rotary evaporator at 30 c giving a concentration of 6 23 0 18 mg c l for representative nom materials elliott soil humic acid esha and suwanee river fulvic acid srfa were obtained from the international humic substances society ihss the nom stock solutions were prepared by dissolving 100 mg of the powder in 1 l of milli q water 68 3 mg c l for srfa and 55 4 mg c l for esha diluted to approximately 15 mg c l to match the ps dom prepared under uv irradiation 2 3 mineral adsorption isotherms and kinetic experiments adsorption isotherm experiments were conducted in a 0 01 m nacl solution containing each mineral as an adsorbent to account for the large difference in surface areas between the two minerals a lower goethite dose 0 09 2 5 g l was used than for kaolinite 0 55 15 g l ensuring a similar surface area per unit mass as the ps dom the resulting surface areas ranged from 6 4 to 174 m2 l for kaolinite and from 6 9 to 190 m2 l for goethite the initial mp dom concentrations and the mineral doses were varied to meet the target ranges i e 0 01 4 00 mg c per gram of kaolinite and 0 08 24 00 mg c per gram of goethite table s1 before the adsorption experiments the ph of the solutions was adjusted to 7 0 using 1 m hcl or naoh the mineral suspension solutions containing mp dom were transferred into autoclaved 120 c for 15 min glass amber vials 40 ml with teflon screw caps the vials were placed on a reciprocating shaker for 24 h to equilibrate at room temperature in the dark no substantial change in ph was observed during the mixing which deviated by 0 3 from the original value i e 7 0 all experiments were performed in triplicate mineral suspensions without mp dom were used as controls for the final concentrations of mp dom in the aqueous phase table s2 after apparent equilibrium was reached all suspensions were filtered through 0 2 μm pre washed cellulose acetate filters advantec to obtain the residual mp dom samples detailed experimental conditions are summarized in table s1 adsorption kinetics experiments were conducted in batches using the maximum mp dom to mineral mass ratios i e 4 mg c g kaolinite and 24 mg c g goethite the general procedure was similar to previous equilibrium isotherm experiments the samples were sacrificed when the designated mixing times were reached at ten points for ps dom and five points for pvc dom to further investigate the effect of nom on the adsorptive behavior of mp dom adsorption equilibrium experiments were conducted using mixtures of uv irradiated ps dom and nom at different mixing ratios the initial ps dom was fixed at 12 mg c l and the dom to mineral ratio was set at 24 mg c g adsorption isotherm parameters were estimated by fitting the experimental data to two well known adsorption isotherm models namely the langmuir model 1 and the freundlich model 2 1 q e q m a x k l c e 1 k l c e 2 q e k f c e 1 n where qe and qmax represent the amount of solute i e ps dom adsorbed and the maximum adsorption capacity at equilibrium respectively ce is the equilibrium concentration of ps dom in the aqueous phase kl is the adsorption affinity related to the adsorption energy kf and 1 n represents the freundlich adsorption capacity factor and the model site heterogeneity factor or an indicator of isotherm nonlinearity respectively the parameters for the adsorption kinetics were estimated using a pseudo first order kinetic model 3 3 q t 1 e k t t where qt and qe are the adsorbed amounts of mp dom after adsorption at time point t and at equilibrium respectively and kt 1 h refers to the pseudo first order model constant where t is the adsorption time 2 4 analytical measurements 2 4 1 doc measurement doc concentrations in the residual ps dom after adsorption were determined using a toc analyzer shimadzu l series tocchp japan the solutions for doc analyses were collected in pre combusted 40 ml glass vials acidified with 1 m hcl solution to attain a ph of 2 0 and stored at 4 c until measured a standard stock solution was also prepared for doc measurements using potassium hydrogen phthalate which was tested daily to check the accuracy of the toc analyzer 2 for a doc concentration of 0 5 mg l 2 4 2 ftir spectroscopy zeta potentials and elemental composition ftir nicolet is10 thermo scientific was used to identify the different functional groups contained in the mp dom samples following published protocols chen et al 2018 briefly 10 ml of the filtered mp dom sample was mixed with 100 mg of kbr powder sigma aldrich ft ir grade and freeze dried for further analysis as a blank clean kbr pellets were prepared through a drying step at 105 c for 2 h the scanned wavenumber ranged from 650 cm 1 to 4000 cm 1 each ftir spectrum was corrected for baseline shifts and smoothed using origin 9 0 software 12 points savitzky golay method the ftir peak intensities were normalized by the summed intensities of all the observed peaks yang et al 2015 the ftir measurements of two separately prepared samples resulted in consistent spectral features fig s2 a zeta potential meter litesizer 500 anton paar was used to measure the zeta potentials of the ps dom samples the ps dom solutions were adjusted to four different ph values ph 3 5 7 and 9 using a 0 1 m naoh or hcl solution the variation in ph was minimal during the measurements with deviations of 0 3 from the initial values the elemental compositions i e chons contents of the mp dom samples which were concentrated using a nitrogen rotary evaporator were determined using an elemental analyzer thermo scientific flash 2000 2 4 3 determination of dom molecular size distributions different size fractions for dom samples were quantified using a high performance liquid chromatography system s 100 knauer berlin germany equipped with an organic carbon detector ocd and a size exclusion column 250 mm 20 mm tsk hw 50s the detailed analytical procedure is described elsewhere chen et al 2016 huber et al 2011 the assignment and quantification of five different size fractions which included biopolymer bp humic substances hs building blocks bb low molecular weight acids lmwa and low molecular weight neutrals lmwn were made based on established procedures huber et al 2011 and in built software the sec measurements were performed on one representative sample out of the three replicates 2 4 4 two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2d cos 2d cos was applied to capture any sequential changes occurring in the ftir spectra of the ps dom during adsorption increasing adsorption percentages or increasing adsorption sites on a mineral were set as an external perturbation for the 2d cos synchronous syn and asynchronous asyn maps were generated by employing the 2dshige freeware https sites google com site shigemorita home 2dshige on the one hand the auto peak intensities which are located on the diagonal lines of the syn maps represent the degrees of the overall spectral changes induced by the external perturbation on the other hand the cross peaks positioned off of the diagonal lines in the syn maps reveal the different directions of the changes sequential order was determined by comparing the signs of the peaks in the syn and asyn maps and by applying the noda s rule mcclure et al 1996 yan et al 2013 if the signs of the peaks are the same on both syn and asyn maps the changes at the x axis precede those at the y axis if the signs are different the sequence of the change is reversed with respect to the coordinates i e noda s rule the detailed mathematical expressions for the two spectra are as follows noda et al 2000 3 3 v 1 v 2 1 t m a x t m i n t m i n t

and an external perturbation respectively y v t is the dynamic spectrum and z v t is the hilbert transformed orthogonal spectrum 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of ps dom 3 1 1 functional groups ftir has been widely used as a simple efficient and nondestructive method for identifying the different compositions of plastic polymers jung et al 2018 the two plastics used in this study exhibited several distinctive peaks in their ftir spectra peaks a at 690 760 cm 1 b at 1360 1460 cm 1 c at 1490 1500 cm 1 d at 2840 2930 cm 1 and e at 3020 3030 cm 1 were observed for the ps material the pvc particles showed peaks at 960 970 cm 1 peak i 1100 cm 1 peak iii 1250 1265 cm 1 peak iv 1420 1460 cm 1 peak v and 2830 2960 cm 1 peak viii fig 1a 1b and table s3 among the identified peaks ps peaks b and d and pvc peaks v and viii indicate carbon chains with repeated ch2 units which have been commonly observed in other plastics including polyethylene pe and polypropylene pp table s3 peaks a c and e which were exclusively observed in the ps are related to benzene rings table s3 interestingly some peaks of the plastic particles did not appear in the ftir spectra of the leached dom samples for example peaks a c and e which are unique to ps were not observed in the ps dom spectra fig 1a similar observations have been reported in the study of plastic derived dom using pe and pp plastic polymers lee et al 2020 in addition the leached dom exhibited several spectral peaks that were not originally observed in particle spectra for example peak g and peak vii which are related to the carboxylates used as additives in plastics were observed only in the spectra of dom leached from the ps and pvc respectively similarly peaks h and viii and peak vi represent the plastic monomers and bisphenol a in pvc respectively for the uv irradiated ps dom i e the ps dom leached under uv irradiation additional peaks were observed at 1742 cm 1 peak f and 1169 cm 1 peak i these two peaks were previously reported for oxidized polymers gugumus 1999 lucki and rånby 1979 which can be linked to oxygen containing groups generated during uv irradiation table s3 the ftir results of the irradiated ps dom are in line with mass spectroscopy observations gewert et al 2018 which indicates the release of styrene monomers containing carboxylic groups into the aqueous phase from ps plastic when was exposed to uv light liu et al 2020 also documented the presence of oxygen containing groups in the leachate of mp during the weathering process 3 1 2 leached amounts and molecular size distribution of ps dom for the dark condition the concentrations of doc released per gram of pvc were nearly four times higher than those of ps 0 45 0 05 mg c g pvc compared to 0 12 0 01 mg c g ps fig 1c this suggests that the amounts of leached doc might be highly dependent upon plastic type this is consistent with the findings of suhrhoff and scholz böttcher 2016 who reported that pvc typically contains high additive loads and is more vulnerable in the aqueous phase than ps furthermore the leached quantities of ps dom per mass of ps were nearly 25 times higher for the uv irradiated samples than for the dark treated samples 3 30 0 33 mg c g ps compared to 0 12 0 01 mg c g ps fig 1c these results indicate that uv irradiation induced the structures of ps to become more vulnerable to dissolution the leached amount under uv irradiation was on average equivalent to nearly 0 3 of the total mass of the added ps it is likely that ps is susceptible to photo degradation as its phenyl rings are easily excited by uv light similar structural instability of ps under uv light was reported by song et al 2017 who found a significant difference in the number of fragmented plastic particles with and without a six month period of uv irradiation 12 152 3276 particles pellets compared to 4220 33 particles pellets respectively five different size fractions bp hs bb lmwa and lmwn were identified in the mp dom samples produced either in the dark or under uv light fig 1d irrespective of the experimental conditions the lmwn 350 da fraction was found to be dominant constituting 67 4 79 3 of the bulk mp dom this contrasted the typical make up of the aquatic nom which was characterized by a much lower distribution of lmwn esha 18 0 and srfa 12 2 fig s3 relative to the larger sized hs and bp fractions it is possible that mps release oligomers with low molecular weights into the aqueous phase during the weathering process as a result of polymer chain scission gewert et al 2018 this mechanism is also supported by the existence of high levels of styrene oligomers up to 31 400 μg kg in beach sands around the world kwon et al 2015 furthermore the relatively higher abundance of the lmwn fraction in the irradiated 79 3 versus dark treated ps dom 67 4 was notable which can be ascribed in part to a higher production of this fraction under uv irradiation and or to the photo degradation of the lmwa or bb fractions similar observations have been previously reported lee et al 2020 which may be taken to demonstrate that the relative abundance of the lmwn fraction of plastic polymer derived dom increases with longer exposure to irradiation whereas larger sized fractions decreased 3 1 3 zeta potentials and elemental composition the net charge characteristics of dom at varying solution ph which are typically estimated by zeta potential measurements provide mechanistic insights into dom adsorption behavior on mineral surfaces rahman et al 2013 in this study the zeta potentials of mp dom were measured over a ph range of 3 0 to 9 0 fig 1e similar to typical aquatic and terrestrial nom kloster et al 2013 saab et al 2010 all the mp dom samples exhibited negative zeta potentials at ph values above 3 0 in addition there were notable differences in the charge characteristics of the two ps dom samples i e dark versus uv treated samples at any given ph in comparison to the dark treated samples uv irradiated ps dom was more negatively charged for example at ph 7 the zeta potentials of the dark treated and the light treated ps dom samples were 3 32 mv and 20 79 mv respectively this can be explained by the acidic effect of the carboxylic group containing photolytic byproducts produced under uv irradiation this is consistent with observations that humic acid with more abundant carboxylic groups is more negatively charged than fulvic acid liang et al 2011 the more negatively charged ps dom can be more favorably adsorbed onto minerals with a net positive surface charge via electrostatic attraction while adsorption is unfavorable if the mineral has a net negative surface charge due to electrostatic repulsion considering the pzcs of the two minerals it can be inferred that the uv irradiated ps dom will adsorb more readily onto goethite than the dark treated ps dom however the difference in adsorptive affinity may be less pronounced for kaolinite fig 1e the atomic ratios h c and o c obtained from the elemental analyses of mp dom are presented in fig 1f and table s4 in general all of the mp dom samples presented higher h c and o c ratios than those of srfa and esha 0 95 1 10 compared to 0 06 0 08 for h c and 1 36 1 48 compared to 0 59 0 80 for o c respectively a lower h c atomic ratio has been interpreted as being indicative of abundant aromatic structures in organic matter thurman 2012 the o c ratio of the uv irradiated ps dom was higher than that of the dark treated counterpart i e 1 48 compared to 1 36 which can be attributed to the production of oxygen containing carbon structures under the stimulating effect of uv irradiation these results are in line with previous observations gewert et al 2018 made using mass spectroscopy to detect the occurrence of oxidized end groups in the aqueous phase when commercial plastics were exposed to uv light 3 2 adsorption behavior of ps dom onto minerals 3 2 1 adsorption isotherms the adsorption isotherms of mp dom are shown in fig 2 and the related model parameters are listed in table 1 the r2 values of the langmuir and freundlich models were all high r2 0 94 suggesting that the two isotherm models reasonably explained the adsorption behaviors of mp dom although the adsorption behavior at equilibrium was well described it should be noted that the langmuir model parameters are theoretically constrained by several assumptions including monolayer adsorption and homogeneous surfaces wang and wang 2018 whereas the freundlich model assumes adsorbents have a heterogeneous surface and applies to both monolayer and multilayer sorption foo and hameed 2010 wu et al 2019 it was observed that substantial amounts of mp dom up to 94 4 for the dark treated dom and 95 2 for the uv irradiated dom were adsorbed onto both minerals table s1 furthermore for each type of mp dom the extent of adsorption was greater on goethite than on kaolinite for example the surface area normalized maximum adsorption capacity qmax of the dark treated pvc dom on goethite 1298 136 mg c cm2 was nearly four times higher than that on kaolinite 323 15 mg c cm2 these observed differences can be attributed to the greater abundance of positive surface charges on goethite relative to kaolinite at ph 7 which is favorable for the adsorption of negatively charged pvc dom particularly the irradiated ps dom via electrostatic attraction hur and schlautman 2003 murphy et al 1990 the distribution of hydroxyl groups on kaolinite which are primarily concentrated on kaolinite edges huertas et al 1998 sutheimer et al 1999 possibly plays a role in the lower surface normalized qmax value of kaolinite compared to goethite for the same mineral the adsorption affinity kf was much higher for the irradiated dom than the dark treated dom the kf value of the irradiated dom was 907 37 mg c cm2 l mg 1 n on goethite compared to 376 21 mg c cm2 l mg 1 n for the dark treated dom table 1 the higher adsorption affinity of the irradiated ps dom implies that the dissolved photolytic byproducts from ps plastic are favorably adsorbed onto minerals this is supported by the observation that irradiated ps dom was more negatively charged than the dark treated ps dom therefore these results further indicate that electrostatic attraction might be the dominant mechanism controlling the adsorption of ps dom onto the selected minerals however electrostatic attraction alone cannot explain all the adsorption phenomena as this is not likely to have been actively operating in the kaolinite adsorption experiments given the relatively low pzc at ph 7 of the mineral surfaces and edges furthermore enhanced adsorption onto the irradiated versus dark treated ps dom was still observed for kaolinite even though the irradiated samples exhibited a more negative charge among the commonly cited adsorption mechanisms that could exist between dom and minerals hydrophobic interactions are not likely to dominate in this case as kaolinite adsorbed proportionally less of the dark treated ps dom fig 2a which has a relatively large molecular size fig 1d ligand exchange is a more likely candidate that could explain the adsorption of ps dom onto kaolinite in the context of this study ligand exchange involves the binding of anions in the aqueous phase with surface hydroxyl layers of minerals zhang et al 2012 the anionic e g carboxyl groups of ps dom as revealed by the previously discussed ftir spectroscopy may play an important role in the ligand exchange driven interaction with the hydroxyl groups on the surfaces or edges of kaolinite the 1 n values from the freundlich model were well below 1 0 this indicates that the available adsorption sites are limited to both minerals and that competition exists among the different mp dom constituents furthermore the n value was consistently lower for the irradiated ps dom 0 58 for kaolinite and 0 52 for goethite than the dark treated ps dom 0 61 for kaolinite and 0 58 for goethite this suggests that the competition for adsorption sites would be stronger for the irradiated ps dom probably because of its heterogeneous composition in comparison with the dark treated dom 3 2 2 adsorption kinetics the adsorption kinetic parameters based on the doc concentrations are presented in table 1 irrespective of the leaching conditions the apparent equilibrium for all the mp doms was reached within 24 h fig 2 the equilibrium concentration qe and the adsorption rate kt for the irradiated and the dark treated ps dom which were estimated by the pseudo first order model were different for example the mean values of qe and kt on goethite were approximately 2 5 and 1 4 times higher for the irradiated than for the dark treated samples respectively this can be ascribed to the differences in the net charge of the two ps dom samples this may also be explained in part by the smaller molecular size of the irradiated ps dom as smaller molecules are likely to be favored during the fast initial adsorption process due to their higher rate of diffusion kilduff et al 1996 3 2 3 effects of solution ph and nom the effect of solution ph on the adsorption of mp dom was examined by varying the doc adsorption rate over a ph range of 3 to 9 fig s4 for both minerals the adsorption of mp dom was highly ph dependent with greater adsorption observed at lower ph this may be explained by a greater contribution of site dependent sorption processes at lower ph including electrostatic attraction and ligand exchange hur and schlautman 2004 weng et al 2007 the ph effect was more pronounced on goethite than on kaolinite over the investigated ph range for example the doc adsorption rates of the dark treated ps dom varied from 20 5 to 50 6 on goethite compared to 6 1 to 24 1 on kaolinite this can be ascribed to the differences in the pzc of the two minerals and the general tendency for a dramatic change in doc adsorption around the mineral pzc value avena and koopal 1999 to examine the effect of nom on the adsorption of mp dom adsorption rates were compared using mixtures consisting of uv irradiated ps dom and nom srfa and esha at different mixing ratios on the basis of doc i e ps dom nom 10 0 9 1 7 5 2 5 5 5 and 0 10 fig s5 the adsorption rates showed increasing trends with a higher abundance of nom in the mixtures the relative differences in the adsorption rates between the mixtures without nom i e pure ps dom versus those with 100 nom were approximately 4 2 for srfa and 20 3 for esha these results suggest that competitive adsorption between mp dom and nom occurs towards the mineral surfaces and that adsorption may be more preferable for nom than for mp dom the nom effect appears to be more pronounced for esha than for srha and although the effect resulting from competitive adsorption was observed quantitative distinction between mp dom and nom is required to properly delineate the competitive adsorption behavior between the two types of dom i e mp dom and nom 3 3 change in ftir spectra with adsorption to obtain more detailed information regarding the sequential structural changes of mp dom during adsorption ps dom was chosen as a representative mp dom and a series of ftir spectra of the residual dom after adsorption were incorporated into 2d cos i e 2d coir irrespective of the leaching conditions the ftir peaks identified in the original ps dom spectra were all observed in the sample spectra after adsorption i e peaks b g h and d for the dark treated dom and peaks i b g h f and d for the uv irradiated dom the peak intensities decreased with increasing adsorbed amounts or increasing adsorption sites although the magnitude of the decrease varied fig 3 the results suggest that all the ps dom structures related to the identified ftir peaks participated in the adsorption the ftir peaks that changed more may be linked to ps dom structures with stronger adsorption affinities for the mineral surfaces on the diagonal lines of the syn maps figs 4 a and 4b for goethite and figs s6a and s6b for kaolinite several distinctive peaks were observed for both the dark treated dom peaks g b and h and uv irradiated dom peaks i g h f and d the negative signs of the peaks indicated that with increasing amounts adsorbed the corresponding changes occurred in such a way as to lower the peak intensities the asyn map revealed additional information regarding the sequential changes in ftir spectra in response to increasing adsorbed ps dom amounts or adsorption sites on the minerals for example for the dark treated dom on goethite the h g peak x axis y axis displayed a negative sign as well as a negative sign at the same location on the syn map fig 4c following noda s rules hur and lee 2011 noda et al 2000 for the dark treated sample the adsorption of different ps dom structures on goethite was in the order of monomers peak h carboxylates in additives peak g similarly the adsorption of the dark treated dom on kaolinite can be interpreted to occur in the order of peak h peak g peak b a common plastic unique peak these results suggest that the leached monomers preferentially adsorbed over the additives table s3 for the irradiated ps dom on goethite positively signed cross peaks were observed at the g i h i f i g f and h f peaks below the diagonal of the asyn map and the corresponding locations were all negative on the syn map figs 3c and 3d fig s6 and tables s4 and s5 based on these observations as adsorption progressed corresponding changes occurred in the order of peak i peak h peak g peak f the peak assignments table s3 further revealed that the adsorption of the irradiated ps dom had a preferential order of oxidized structures monomers carboxylates in additives carbonyl groups except for the absence of peak h no differences were found in the sequential adsorption of different functional groups between the two minerals this implies that the absorption of oxidized byproducts was favored over the adsorption of polymer derived substances and additives the sequence of adsorption on the minerals for the different ps dom structures is consistent with the proposition that electrostatic attraction was the main adsorption mechanism 3 4 comparison of adsorption behaviors between ps dom and nom and environmental implications the adsorption affinities for goethite kl and kf of the three types of mp dom were compared with previously published nom data table 2 which are comparable under similar environmental conditions for example the adsorption affinity parameters of the dark treated mp dom pvc dom and ps dom fitted by the langmuir isotherm model kl fall within the range of 0 07 l mg c to 0 62 l mg c as previously reported for aquatic nom kaiser 2003 tipping 1981 wang et al 1997 it is notable that previous nom adsorption studies have used humic substances humic acid or fulvic acid as major constituents of nom which are limited as proxies for the whole composition of nom humic substances contain large aromatic structures enriched with acidic functional groups and as such are favorably adsorbed onto minerals in this context it is likely that bulk nom might have a lower adsorption affinity than humic substances consequently the interaction between mp dom and mineral surfaces could be even stronger than the interaction between these surfaces and whole nom it was previously reported that plastic additives such as bisphenol a and dibutyl phthalate which are often added during the manufacture of several types of plastics suhrhoff and scholz böttcher 2016 show strong adsorption tendencies toward mineral surfaces koduru et al 2016 xu and li 2008 given that additives are one of the major constituents of commercial plastics it is not surprising that the adsorption behaviors of the additives were similar to those of mp dom table 2 carboxylic groups have been detected in uv irradiated plastics including pe pp and pet gewert et al 2018 thus the abundance of acidic functional groups in plastic derived dom favors adsorption onto minerals taken together these results demonstrate that the interactions between plastic derived dom and minerals could be as strong as those between minerals and nom therefore in mp contaminated environments there may be competition between nom and plastic derived dom for adsorption sites on mineral surfaces which may also disturb the equilibria previously established between nom and minerals which may interfere with the fate and transport of nom in subsurface systems to extend and generalize the novel findings in this work further adsorption experiments using other plastic derived dom samples and inorganic minerals are recommended competitive adsorption experiments between nom and mp dom on minerals are also required to gain a better understanding of the interactions between dom and mineral surfaces in mp polluted environments this would help clarify the pertinent underlying mechanisms responsible for the adsorption of plastic derived dom onto minerals and the environmental fate of these organic substances in mineral enriched environments 4 conclusions this study has provided the first report of the adsorptive behavior of plastic derived dom on minerals based on the results the following key conclusions can be drawn 1 mp dom exhibited a high adsorption affinity toward mineral surfaces the extent of adsorption was greater for uv irradiated than dark treated ps dom the extent and affinity of adsorption were higher for goethite than kaolinite the adsorption behaviors were well explained by electrostatic attraction and ligand exchange irradiated ps dom which contains more oxygen containing groups than dark treated dom was more favorably adsorbed onto the minerals 2 the 2d coir maps of the irradiated ps dom revealed that oxidized structures were favorably adsorbed over monomer related structures and additives the sequence of preferential adsorption for the different functional groups in the ps dom was consistent with the dominant adsorption mechanisms operative in the system 3 the adsorption isotherm model parameters of the mp dom were comparable to those obtained from aquatic and terrestrial nom which suggests that plastic derived dom can play a critical role in modifying mineral surfaces in mp contaminated environments for the first time these results reveal the strong affinity of plastic derived dom towards mineral surfaces thus the interaction of plastic derived dom and minerals should be taken into account if a full understanding of the fate and the environmental consequences of plastic derived dom in mp polluted and mineral enriched environments is to be attained declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements this work was supported by grants from the national research foundation of korea nrf as funded by the korean government
