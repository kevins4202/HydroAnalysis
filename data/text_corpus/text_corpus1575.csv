7875,study region the upper taoer river watershed utrw northeastern china study focus this study presents a comprehensive hydrometeorological evaluation of six satellite precipitation products spps over a sparsely gauged semi arid watershed including the adjusted and unadjusted versions of tropical rainfall measuring mission multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa global precipitation measurement gpm integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm products imerg and precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks perisiann series the effectiveness of monthly bias correction in improving spps estimation accuracy and in enhancing their feasibility in hydrological applications was also analyzed new hydrological insights for the region the spps especially bias corrected spps adequately provide complementary precipitation information for utrw where ground measurement is insufficient the adjusted spps after bias correction obtained a higher nash sutcliffe efficiency nse than gauge data when driving streamflow simulation the unadjusted spps hydrological applicability was significantly enhanced after bias correction with nse 0 except for imerg product and nse 0 34 before and after correction respectively performance of the tmpa series improved the most through bias correction making it the preferred choice for daily and monthly simulations additionally spps were more applicable in wet and normal years and require improvement in dry years this study provides valuable references for identifying better alternative precipitation sources for local water resource management and exploring an effective spp utilization approach in practical applications graphical abstract ga1 keywords satellite precipitation products hydrological simulation swat northeastern china 1 introduction precipitation is the most important driving factor of the terrestrial hydrological cycles and is a primary contributor to uncertainties in hydrological fluxes and state predictions le et al 2020 sangati and borga 2009 as such accurate precipitation observations or estimations are crucial for hydrograph prediction flood forecasting drought monitoring and water resource allocation and management nguyen et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 conventionally ground gauges are the primary approach to obtaining precipitation anagnostou et al 2009 yuan et al 2018 however due to financial or topographical limitations ground based precipitation observations are usually infrequent or nonexistent in numerous areas worldwide particularly in developing countries and remote regions yu et al 2019 recently satellite precipitation products hereafter spps have been rapidly developed and have exhibited unprecedented values in providing spatiotemporally continuous precipitation estimates darko et al 2021 khatakho et al 2021 tang et al 2020 many spps such as tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa huffman et al 2007 global precipitation measurement gpm integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm products imerg hou et al 2014 and precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks perisiann hsu et al 1997 have shown promising abilities in capturing spatiotemporal variabilities in precipitation as well as in driving hydrological simulations lakew et al 2020 sirisena et al 2018 yuan et al 2018 however given that climate and topography significantly affect the quality of spps bitew and gebremichael 2011 it is necessary to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of satellite based precipitation estimates and their feasibilities in driving hydrological simulations in different regions of the world each spp contains various versions which can be divided into two categories i e gauge adjusted and gauge unadjusted it is well accepted that the gauge adjusted products are more accurate than their unadjusted versions as they have been systematically corrected by global ground gauge networks e g the gpcc global precipitation climatology centre and gpcp global precipitation climatology project le et al 2020 however the effectiveness of such global scale adjustment still needs to be verified for areas not covered by the global gauge network for unadjusted products although being released timely the estimation error of precipitation magnitudes is much more considerable than the adjusted versions jiang et al 2016 satgé et al 2021 it should be noted that the near real time released unadjusted spps have incomparable values in time sensitive hydrological applications such as flood forecasting and warning therefore manual correction for unadjusted spps is essential to enhance their adequacy in hydrological applications previous studies have proposed various methods to correct satellite precipitation estimates using ground based observations such as the monthly bias correction method yuan et al 2017 the geographical adjustment model zhang et al 2019 and the error decomposition method chaudhary and dhanya 2021 among them the monthly bias correction method is more suitable for sparsely gauged areas due to its lower requirement for ground observation and satisfactory performance hashemi et al 2017 valdés pineda et al 2016 hydrological models are practical tools for quantitatively evaluating the abilities of spps in hydrological applications for this purpose various hydrological models have been cooperatively applied with multiple spps jiang et al 2018 khatakho et al 2021 xu et al 2022 among which the soil and water assessment tool swat is one of the most widely used models the swat model has well established physical mechanisms of hydrological cycle processes and a semi distributed computational structure le et al 2020 thus it can adequately characterize the influence of spatial variations in precipitation on the hydrological processes of the basin based on swat modeling numerous studies have conducted in depth analyses in humid or semi humid regions worldwide deng et al 2019 tan et al 2018 vu et al 2018 providing valuable information for understanding the abilities of spps for hydrological applications however the feasibility of spps in driving hydrological simulations in arid or semi arid areas especially under different hydrological conditions has been less studied this may be particularly important for local water resource utilization and flood drought risk assessment especially in data sparse regions this study is focused on a sparsely gauged semi arid region in northeastern china i e the upper taoer river watershed utrw the utrw is formed by the construction of chaersen reservoir which supplies essential water resources for residents and socio economic development accurate representation of precipitation and hydrological variable prediction i e streamflow are vital for local water resource planning and management thus a comprehensive hydrometeorological evaluation was conducted for six spps including the gauge adjusted version and the paired unadjusted version of the tmpa imerg and persiann series the specific objectives are threefold 1 to evaluate the quality of six spps against gauge observations at daily and monthly scales 2 to assess the feasibility of spps in simulating daily and monthly streamflow under different hydrologic conditions and 3 to explore the effects of monthly bias correction on promoting the quality of spps and their feasibilities in hydrological simulation this study can provide valuable guidelines for exploring alternative precipitation data under different hydrological conditions in semi arid or arid areas especially when ground precipitation measurements are inadequate 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the taoer river which originates from the greater khingan mountainous range is the main tributary of the lower nen river in northeastern china the upper taoer river watershed utrw is formed by the construction of chaersen reservoir which is located in the middle reach of the taoer river and has a drainage area of 7780 km2 fig 1 a the utrw has a mid temperate continental monsoon climate with an average annual precipitation of 444 mm of which over 70 occurs during the flood season from june to august the average annual air temperature is 3 3 the elevation of utrw varies from 286 m to 1748 m the land use in utrw was dominated by forest frst and pasture past covering 47 and 41 of the total area respectively other land uses include agricultural land argl 10 surface water watr 1 residential land urld and urhd 1 and wetland wetl 0 1 fig 1 b the soils in this area are dominated by haplic luvisols lvh 55 and calcaric phaeozems phc 18 as shown in fig 1 c the chaersen reservoir plays a vital role in regional disaster prevention water supply and ecological protection with a total storage capacity of 12 53 108 m3 the chaersen reservoir is designed to protect approximately 6 million people from flood disasters covering a total protective area of 4670 km2 additionally it supplies water for the 665 km2 of irrigated land in the downstream region and several national wetland reserves e g xianghai and momoge therefore accurate prediction of hydrological components of utrw is essential for the rational allocation and regulation of water resources 2 2 data 2 2 1 ground data daily ground gauge hereafter gauge precipitation data from 2001 to 2017 were downloaded from the china meteorological administration cma http data cma cn as shown in fig 1 a there is only one meteorological station located within the watershed i e suolun station sl 121 2 e 46 6 n and there are two stations located approximately 10 km wulanhaote wlht 122 1 e 46 1 n and 29 km aershan aes 119 9 e 47 2 n away from the watershed precipitation records from the three gauges were used as benchmarks for further assessment of spps accuracy and hydrological applicability the gauge precipitation was recorded by two subperiods i e utc universal time coordinated 12 utc 00 and utc 00 utc 12 to maintain temporal consistency with spp estimates i e utc 00 utc 24 gauge data were calculated as the sum of precipitation records from utc 00 to utc 12 of the current day and utc 12 to utc 00 of the next day the monthly precipitation was then aggregated from the daily records in addition multiple categories of data were collected to establish the swat model meteorological data i e daily wind speed air temperature and relative humidity at the sl wlht and aes meteorological stations fig 1 from 2001 to 2017 were collected from cma daily inflows of the chaersen reservoir cr station from 1955 to 2017 were obtained from the chaersen reservoir administration hydrological frequency curves were plotted using the entire time series to define annual runoff frequency levels i e wet normal and dry years while data from 2001 to 2017 were used in the calibration and validation of the hydrological simulation geographical data including topography land use and soil type were also required for modeling the 90 m digital elevation model data dem were obtained from the national aeronautics and space administration shuttle radar topographic mission http srtm csi cgiar org land use and soil type data with a 1 km resolution were both downloaded from the data center for resources and environmental sciences chinese academy of sciences http www resdc cn 2 2 2 satellite precipitation products three spp series were assessed in this study i e tmpa imerg and persiann each series contains both gauge adjusted and gauge unadjusted versions the spatial temporal characteristics of all ssps are summarized in table 1 tmpa was designed to provide a calibration based sequential scheme for combining precipitation estimates from various satellites and gauges huffman et al 2007 two major products of the latest version were selected in this study i e the post real time version i e 3b42v7 and the near real time version i e 3b42v7rt the former is calibrated by the gpcc precipitation gauge data all tmpa products are available at the goddard earth sciences data and information services center website https gsfc nasa gov daily precipitation records of tmpa 3b42v7 hereafter tmpa v7 and tmpa 3b42v7rt hereafter tmpa v7rt are aggregated from the 3 hourly data and cover a time span of utc 00 utc 24 data from 2001 to 2017 were used for assessment the gpm mission was developed as a successor and advance of the trmm mission the imerg is a level 3 algorithm that combines all microwave sensors in the constellation and infrared based observations from geosynchronous satellites hou et al 2014 imerg provides three levels of products i e the near real time early and late run products and the post real time final run product the final version is more accurate with the adjustment of the gpcc product the two latest daily products were involved in this study i e gpm imerg early run version 6 hereafter imerg e and gpm imerg final run version 6 hereafter imerg f data were obtained from the national aeronautics and space administration nasa website https pmm nasa gov data access downloads gpm the daily precipitation data from 2001 to 2017 with a time span of utc 00 utc 24 were generated by aggregating data from 48 half hourly imerg products persiann was developed at the center for hydrometeorology and remote sensing chrs at the university of california irvine hsu et al 1997 perdiann adopted a neural network approach to derive relationships between infrared data and rain rates and then applied them to generate precipitation estimates persiann cdr hereafter p cdr is the adjusted version of persiann using the gpcp product version 2 2 ashouri et al 2015 in this study the daily p cdr and persiann data from 2001 to 2017 were acquired from the chrs official website http chrsdata eng uci edu with a time span of utc 00 utc 24 3 methodology 3 1 monthly bias correction although tmpa v7 imerg f and p cdr are all gauge adjusted versions their qualities remained to be improved as there were no gauges involved in the global ground gauge networks e g gpcc and gpcp as such to eliminate the biases of both adjusted and unadjusted spps the monthly bias correction method which is friendly to less gauged areas yuan et al 2017 was employed 1 p sat corr x y i p sat x y i k i 2 k i p gau i p sat x g y g i where p sat corr x y i is the bias corrected spp estimates of the grid x y in month i p sat x y i represents the precipitation estimate for month i of the grid x y of spps p gau i and p sat x g y g i are gauge precipitation data for month i and spp precipitation estimates respectively of the grid x g y g where the gauge is located and k i is the monthly correction coefficient in month i for each spp k i was computed based on the gauge precipitation data and the satellite precipitation data of the grid where the rain gauge is located as expressed in eq 2 and then k i was applied to all satellite grids over the study region eq 1 3 2 swat application the swat model was adopted in this study to investigate the feasibility of different spps for driving hydrological simulation swat is a well established semi distributed ecohydrological model operating at daily monthly or yearly steps arnold et al 1998 the model describes the hydrological process as a two component system i e land hydrology and channel hydrology the hydrological response unit hru is the minimum element to calculate the hydrological processes in the swat model all hydrological processes are separately predicted for each hru and then routed to each sub basin and subsequently to the entire watershed detailed information on the swat model is described in arnold et al 2012 the utrw was delineated into 30 sub basins containing 336 hrus with threshold values of 5 for land use 20 for soil types and 20 for slope daily meteorological data i e precipitation air temperature wind speed and relative humidity were used to drive the model in this study seven precipitation datasets i e gauge tmpa v7 imerg f p cdr tmpa v7rt imerg e and persiann were used to force the daily and monthly streamflow simulations the grid center of spp was assumed to be the virtual meteorological station and was used to drive the model for each simulation run model parameters were independently calibrated by fitting the simulated streamflow to the observed data at the cr station auto calibration for model parameters was performed by the sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm sufi 2 ver 2 in swat cup software abbaspour et al 2007 23 sensitive parameters were selected for model calibration see table s1 in the supplementary materials parameter ranges were identified based on the accepted model manual and reference han and zheng 2016 the entire simulation period from 2001 to 2017 was divided into a warm up period 2001 2003 a calibration period 2004 2011 and a validation period 2012 2017 the optimized parameter values for each precipitation input were separately calibrated at daily and monthly scales see figs s1 and s2 in the supplementary materials 3 3 performance assessment the accuracy of spps versus gauge observations was evaluated using statistical and categorical metrics for the statistical assessment the correlation coefficient cc root mean square error rmse and relative bias rb were applied to assess the performances of the spp datasets in capturing the temporal dynamics of gauge precipitation for the categorical assessment the abilities of spps in detecting precipitation events were evaluated by the probability of detection pod false alarm ratio far and critical success index csi the precipitation and non precipitation events were differentiated with a threshold of 1 mm day according to previous studies yong et al 2010 table 2 lists the formulae ranges and optimal values of the evaluation indices the assessment was based on the grid scale that is the grids where the aes sl and wlht meteorological stations are located were selected to present spp performance the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and percent bias pb were utilized moriasi et al 2007 nash and sutcliffe 1970 to assess the performance in hydrological simulation an nse value between 0 and 1 generally indicates acceptable performance whereas values below 0 suggest that the mean observed value is a better predictor than the simulated value pointing to unacceptable performance moriasi et al 2007 as shown in table 3 four model performance ranks i e very good good satisfactory and unsatisfactory were assigned for the acceptable values of nse and pb in addition a model performance score mps was defined to evaluate the performance of different precipitation datasets in driving the hydrological simulation nse and pb in very good good satisfactory and unsatisfactory levels were assigned 5 points 4 points 3 points and 1 point respectively and mps was the summation of the nse and pb points note that mps was counted as 0 when either nse 0 or pb 50 occurred 4 results 4 1 evaluation of spps 4 1 1 daily precipitation the abilities of all six spps in characterizing the gauge precipitation were assessed fig 2 displays the scatter plots of precipitation data of spps versus gauge and the comparison indices generally the gauge adjusted products i e tmpa v7 imerg f and p cdr demonstrated better fits with gauge observations than the unadjusted products i e tmpa v7rt imerg e and persiann as indicated by the relatively higher cc smaller rmse and smaller rb values for tmpa and imerg series the discrepancy was particularly remarkable for the rb index of tmpa series which was 12 8 for tmpa v7 and 65 9 for tmpa v7rt the imerg series exhibited the best performance among the three spp series for the gauge adjusted products fig 2 a c imerg f has the highest cc 0 60 smallest rmse 3 8 mm and smallest rb 2 1 in the statistical assessment and the smallest far 0 43 and highest csi 0 42 in the categorical assessment a similar advantage of imerg e was also observed among the unadjusted products fig 2 d f the tmpa and persiann series showed comparable performances specifically the tmpa series had a better ability to detect precipitation events as indicated by the higher pod only for tmpa v7rt smaller far and higher csi while the perisiann series was more accurate in terms of the precipitation magnitude as indicated by the smaller values of rmse and rb indices fig 3 displays the plots of bias corrected spps hereafter denoted by spp corr see section 3 1 for details versus gauge precipitation data the results indicated that bias correction efficiently improved the estimate accuracy for all spps in terms of the statistical metrics the improvement from bias correction was particuarly significant for the unadjusted products i e tmpa v7rt imerg e and persiann the rb significantly decreased from 4 4 65 9 fig 2 d f to 0 1 0 2 fig 3 d f and cc and rmse also improved slightly after correction among the three unadjusted spps the improvement of tmpa v7rt corr appeared to be the most prominent where the cc increased from 0 47 to 0 49 rmse decreased from 6 0 mm to 4 3 mm and rb decreased from 65 9 to 0 0 overall the imerg corr series had the best accuracy in precipitation estimates among the three spp corr series the bias correction significantly reduced the systematic errors of the tmpa series resulting in the overall superior performance of the tmpa corr series to the persiann corr series the far for all spp cases was approximately 0 5 figs 2 and 3 indicating that nearly half of the precipitation events detected by spps were false alarms the pod values below 0 7 also revealed that at least 30 of the precipitation events were missed by the spps fortunately approximately 90 of the false alarms were light precipitation events 0 10 mm d and less than 3 were heavy precipitation events 25 mm d for more information on the occurrence percentage of false alarms see fig s3 in the supplementary material the misreports all occurred for light precipitation events 0 10 mm d thus the false alarms and misreports of spps in light precipitation events may not cause significant uncertainty in hydrological applications 4 1 2 monthly precipitation the monthly precipitation of spps was only assessed for their statistical performance because the categorical indices of all spps are equivalent to their optimal values when the accumulated monthly precipitation for all months is larger than 1 mm fig 4 shows the scatter plots of monthly precipitation from the spps before and after bias correction versus the gauge observations overall the correlations between the spp datasets and gauge data significantly improved as the time aggregated from the daily to the monthly scale indicating the satisfactory abilities of spps in characterizing the monthly precipitation variations among the three spp series the imerg series exhibited the best performance compared with the other two series which have higher cc values 0 92 of imerg f and 0 84 of imerg e and smaller rmse 19 2 mm and 28 7 mm and rb values 2 1 and 11 6 for the tmpa and persiann series the tmpa series showed firmer consistency with gauge data indicated by higher cc values while the persiann series had small systematic errors indicated by smaller rb values similar to the daily scale bias correction effectively improved the quality of spps in depicting monthly precipitation variations for the adjusted spps the rmse and rb values decreased from 21 8 mm to 21 0 mm and from 7 8 to 0 1 on average respectively before and after bias correction while the cc value was almost unchanged i e 0 90 and 0 89 on average compared with the adjusted spps the bias correction demonstrated a more significant role in improving the quality of unadjusted spps the average cc rmse and rb values of the three unadjusted products were 0 85 25 2 mm and 0 1 respectively after bias correction fig 4 d f overall our results suggested an adequate ability of bias correction in enhancing the quality of spps especially in reducing the systematic error of unadjusted products 4 2 evaluation of streamflow simulation 4 2 1 daily streamflow simulation fig 5 shows the simulated daily hydrographs of the cr station driven by different precipitation datasets including the gauge data and the raw and corrected datasets of six spps along with the corresponding statistical indices during the entire simulation period table s2 in the supplementary materials summarizes the respective indices for the calibration and validation periods the gauge based model acquired a satisfactory nse of 0 52 and a very good pb of 0 1 during the entire period for spps all the adjusted product based models achieved better performances than the gauge based model in terms of nse although with remarkable systematic errors among the three adjusted spps imerg f performed the best in predicting daily hydrographs nse of 0 59 and pb of 14 followed by tmpa v7 nse of 0 56 and pb of 23 5 and p cdr nse of 0 57 and pb of 42 2 unfortunately the unadjusted spps showed very poor feasibility in predicting daily streamflow simulations forced by tmpa v7rt and persiann both had unacceptable nse below 0 and pb around 50 although the model using imerg e obtained a small pb of 2 2 the nse was only 0 30 the results indicated that bias correction improved the feasibilities of all adjusted spps in driving hydrological simulation fig 5 b d driven by raw spps to corrected spps nse values of streamflow simulation improved from 0 57 to 0 62 on average and the systematic error decreased from 26 6 to 11 7 on average specifically the simulation using tmpa v7 corr exhibited the highest value of nse 0 67 followed by p cdr corr 0 61 and imerg f corr 0 59 while imerg f corr derived the smallest pb 2 2 followed by tmpa v7 corr 8 2 and p cdr corr 24 6 the performances of unadjusted spps were also improved after bias correction which achieved at least acceptable results in forcing daily streamflow simulations specifically tmpa v7rt corr showed the most remarkable improvement in driving the daily simulation with an nse of 0 61 and a pb of 12 which was superior or comparable to the gauge based model and several adjusted spp corr based models i e imerg f corr and p cdr corr noting that near real time spps are vital in time sensitive water resource regulation scenarios our results suggested that bias correction could broaden the applicability of unadjusted spps in early warning systems e g flood forecasting and landslide prediction 4 2 2 monthly streamflow simulation fig 6 displays the monthly hydrographs predicted by various precipitation datasets table s3 in the supplementary materials summarizes the performance indices for the calibration and validation periods in general model performance improved from the daily to the monthly scale which is consistent with previous studies khatakho et al 2021 zhu et al 2018 the adjusted spp based models gained better performances than the gauge based model in terms of nse 0 78 for tmpa v7 0 78 for p cdr 0 73 for imerg f versus 0 73 for gauge for pb tmpa v7 produced comparable systematic errors against gauge 6 0 for tmpa v7 versus 4 1 for gauge while imerg f and p cdr both led to an underestimation of streamflow with pb of 25 6 and 26 6 respectively among the unadjusted products fig 6 e g imerg e performed more promisingly in predicting monthly streamflow as indicated by a satisfactory nse of 0 52 and a good pb of 11 3 but still had much room for improvement compared to gauge and adjusted products tmpa v7rt and persiann showed poor feasibility in driving monthly streamflow simulation with unacceptable nse nse 0 and remarkable bias pb 75 for the spp corr driven simulations the nse and pb scores significantly improved the nse value of the three adjusted spp corr based models increased from 0 77 to 0 81 on average and the systematic error was reduced from 19 4 to 6 4 fig 6 the unadjusted spp corr based models also achieved at least acceptable performances in monthly simulation defined as nse 0 and pb 50 overall the tmpa series benefited the most from bias correction enabling the tmpa corr data to outperform other spps corr and gauge in the monthly hydrological application the tmpa v7 corr based model obtained the highest nse 0 85 and the smallest pb 5 9 among the adjusted spps corr and tmpa v7rt corr also showed superior feasibility among the unadjusted spps corr with a very good nse 0 78 and a good pb 9 6 for the persiann corr and imerg corr series p cdr corr and imerg f corr based models obtained comparable performances nse 0 80 for p cdr corr versus 0 77 for imerg f corr pb 6 8 versus 6 4 while imerg e corr showed better performance than persiann corr with a higher nse 0 57 for imerg e corr versus 0 48 for persiann corr and a smaller pb 7 5 versus 21 the above evaluation results revealed the feasibility of different spps in driving hydrological simulation both for the raw and corrected spps for the raw spps without bias correction it was found that the imerg series had an overall better performance than the tmpa and persiann series especially for their unadjusted versions after bias correction all spps showed improved performances in driving hydrological simulation at both daily and monthly scales the improvement was particularly significant for unadjusted spps e g tmpa v7rt obtained the most predominant improvement comparing the spp with gauge based models it was found that quite a few spp based models outperformed the gauge based model in terms of nse for streamflow simulation including all the raw and corrected adjusted products and the unadjusted product of tmpa v7rt corr in summary our results suggested an optimistic use of spps as an alternative data source to gauge observations for non or sparsely gauged areas however manual correction procedure such as monthly bias correction is necessary to improve the quality of spps especially the near real time unadjusted versions 4 2 3 performance at different annual runoff frequencies an in depth understanding of the spp applicability under different hydrologic conditions is of practical value for guiding spp utilization for different water resource management purposes e g flood warning and drought mitigation for this purpose the entire 14 year simulation period was divided into three annual runoff frequency f ar levels according to the hydrological frequency curve of the cr station i e wet years f ar 37 5 including 2012 2013 and 2015 normal years 37 5 f ar 62 5 including 2005 2011 and 2014 and dry years f ar 62 5 including 2004 2006 2010 2016 and 2017 fig 7 displays the model performance based on 13 precipitation datasets including gauge and raw and corrected spps for wet normal and dry years the gauge based model serves as the benchmark for comparison which exhibited superior performance in wet years nse values were 0 47 and 0 73 and pb values were 1 8 and 6 4 for daily and monthly streamflow simulations respectively fig 7 while in normal years the gauge based model overestimated streamflow by more than 25 at both daily and monthly scales and in dry years it underestimated streamflow by more than 20 daily scale only for the six raw spps imerg f and p cdr exhibited better performances than tmpa v7 during wet years in daily streamflow prediction with nses of 0 59 and 0 63 and pbs of 21 7 and 25 5 respectively tmpa v7 behaved the best in normal years nse 0 47 pb 11 9 and imerg f behaved the best in dry years nse 0 35 pb 9 7 for the monthly simulation p cdr obtained the most potent consistency with observed streamflow in wet and dry years with nses of 0 82 and 0 37 respectively tmpa v7 yielded the highest nse of 0 88 in normal years and the smallest systematic error with rb values of 7 3 3 3 and 12 4 in wet normal and dry years respectively however all the unadjusted spps yielded unacceptable or unsatisfactory nse values 0 5 under three hydrological levels for both daily and monthly streamflow simulations except for imerg e in normal years in particular persiann produced the most remarkable systematic errors pb 40 the model performances driven by spp corr were significantly improved under different hydrologic conditions annotated with the red upward arrow in fig 7 among the six corrected spps the tmpa v7 corr based model obtained the best performance in predicting both daily and monthly streamflow in wet normal and dry years the performance of the tmpa v7rt corr based model in the wet and normal years greatly improved after bias correction which was comparable to or even surpassed its adjusted version tmpa v7 corr however it was found that manual bias correction can also result in worse model performance annotated with the black downward arrow in fig 7 for example tmpa v7 corr imerg f corr and p cdr corr exhibited lower nses in normal years and tmpa v7 corr and imerg e corr showed larger pbs in dry years than their raw versions the mps score see section 3 3 was further calculated to evaluate the overall model performance driven by various precipitation datasets under different hydrological conditions as shown in fig 8 the gauge based model obtained moderate performance in wet and dry years the mps scores were 6 8 points for daily monthly simulation in wet years and 4 8 points in dry years while the performance in normal years was poor for the spps including both raw and corrected versions the average mps was 6 8 points in wet years and 5 7 points in normal years for daily monthly simulation however there remained much room for improvement in the dry year simulation 3 and 4 points on average for daily and monthly simulations respectively although the gauge based model is usually employed in water resource management the spp based models on some occasions were found to exhibit better performances among the 12 spp based models including raw and corrected versions 42 5 in number 75 9 in number and 25 3 in number had comparable or higher mps than gauge based model during wet normal and dry years respectively for daily streamflow simulation and 60 7 in number 83 10 in number and 0 0 in number for monthly simulation such results indicated the considerable potential of spps in forcing hydrological simulations particularly in wet and normal years 5 discussion 5 1 effectiveness of monthly bias correction the spp accuracy in precipitation estimates was closely associated with regional meteorological conditions such as humidity and precipitation magnitude zhang et al 2020 the uncertainties of precipitation estimates were then propagated to streamflow predictions through the hydrological model process li et al 2018 xu et al 2022 as reported by previous studies the performance of spps in hydrological simulations is generally poorer in arid or semi arid areas than in humid areas yu et al 2020 2021 indeed in the semi arid utrw tmpa v7rt showed unacceptable performance in driving streamflow simulation nse 0 fig 5 e and 6 e while achieved at least unsatisfactory nse values 0 nse 0 5 in the humid huifa river basin in northeast china zhu et al 2018 therefore the spp accuracy and applicability need to be thoroughly evaluated and enhanced before its hydrological use in such arid or semi arid areas wherein a manual correction procedure may be necessary especially for the near real time unadjusted spps the results demonstrated that bias correction efficiently reduced the systematic errors of all six spps involved in this study and improved the applicability of spps in hydrological simulation especially for the unadjusted spps figs 3 and 4 although it is recognized that the unadjusted products generally perform inferior to the adjusted products in predicting hydrographs the bias correction procedure can help the unadjusted product e g tmpa v7rt achieve comparable performance to that of the adjusted version in the utrw figs 5 and 6 our study emphasized the necessity and efficiency of bias correction in promoting the widespread application of the unadjusted spps in time sensitive hydrological practices especially in sparsely gauged areas the tmpa series was found to benefit the most from bias correction in terms of the data accuracy and the feasibility in driving hydrological simulation with nse scores of 0 67 and 0 85 for daily and monthly simulations respectively and pb scores of 8 2 and 5 9 respectively fig 5 e and 6 e however bias correction may worsen spp performance in some cases annotated with black downward arrows in fig 7 spp performance was degraded mainly in normal and dry years indicating higher uncertainties of bias correction during the medium to low flow period considering the simple procedure and broad applicability of the bias correction method it is still recommended for improving the feasibility of spps in hydrological applications in less or non gauged areas while exploring an advanced correction method to provide higher quality spp dataset is worthwhile especially for the low flow periods in semi arid areas 5 2 prospects and challenges of spps in hydrological applications in semi arid areas the ground gauge system in the utrw was insufficient to reflect the spatial variability of precipitation which hindered the accurate prediction of hydrological processes fig 5 a and 6 a seven spps e g all the raw and corrected adjusted spps and corrected unadjusted tmpa v7rt exhibited superior performances in terms of nse in driving the hydrological simulation in the utrw compared to the gauge data our results suggested a broad prospect of spps especially bias corrected spps for hydrological application in sparsely gauged areas owing to their advantage in capturing the spatial variation of precipitation nevertheless the performance of the spp based model in daily streamflow simulation was not quite satisfactory the raw spp based models generally had a relatively weak agreement with the measured streamflow nse 0 67 and the spp corr based models considerably underestimated streamflow pb 41 1 which may cause risks in flood forecasting or disaster prevention application the daily streamflow simulation may be easily affected by anthropogenic regulations such as reservoir operation and water withdrawal or discharge however there are few medium or large reservoirs upstream of the taoer river liu et al 2020 and agricultural activities were not very intense with only 10 of the land used for agricultural planting in the utrw fig 1 b as such the relatively poor quality of daily spp estimates cc 0 6 figs 2 and 3 may be the main cause of the inferior performance of daily streamflow simulation a practical approach to improve the quality of daily spp estimates in semi arid areas is worthy of more attention in future studies this study further showed that the performance of spps in driving hydrological simulation differed under different hydrologic conditions i e wet normal and dry years the spp based models exhibited better performances in wet and normal years but behaved inferiorly in dry years fig 8 thus it is better to consider the hydrological condition before using spp and it remains a challenge to apply spp for hydrological application during dry years in arid or semi arid areas it is hoped that a comprehensive improvement of the precipitation data quality the correction method effectiveness and the model structure will be realized shortly to strengthen the hydrological simulation performance especially for the dry period 6 conclusions this study comprehensively evaluated the accuracy and feasibility of six spps including the adjusted and unadjusted products of the tmpa imerg and persiann series in hydrometeorological applications in the upper taoer river watershed northeastern china the bias correction method was applied to the spps to explore its effectiveness in improving the spps abilities in precipitation estimation and hydrological utility the results indicated that for a specific spp series the adjusted product offered more accurate precipitation estimation and was more capable of hydrological simulations than the unadjusted product among the three spp series the imerg series showed the best performance in both meteorological and hydrological assessments followed by the tmpa and persiann series additionally the bias correction is proven to be an effective approach to improve the accuracy of spps especially for unadjusted products the corrected imerg series performed better in depicting precipitation patterns while the corrected tmpa series obtained the best performance in both daily and monthly streamflow predictions in general for local water resource management in the utrw and regions with similar hydrological climatic and geological conditions the imerg series is found to be more reliable in daily streamflow prediction tmpa v7 and imerg e are recommended for monthly applications as the post real time and near real time products respectively once the gauge observations are available for a basal manual correction the bias corrected tmpa products are the first choice for both daily and monthly streamflow simulations however considering that the behaviors of spps are poorer in dry years than in wet or normal years it remains a challenge to apply spps for hydrological applications in dry periods which needs to be strengthened by relying on more accurate spps more efficient correction methods and improved model structures in future studies credit authorship contribution statement lu zhang conceptualization methodology formal analysis writing original

7875,study region the upper taoer river watershed utrw northeastern china study focus this study presents a comprehensive hydrometeorological evaluation of six satellite precipitation products spps over a sparsely gauged semi arid watershed including the adjusted and unadjusted versions of tropical rainfall measuring mission multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa global precipitation measurement gpm integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm products imerg and precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks perisiann series the effectiveness of monthly bias correction in improving spps estimation accuracy and in enhancing their feasibility in hydrological applications was also analyzed new hydrological insights for the region the spps especially bias corrected spps adequately provide complementary precipitation information for utrw where ground measurement is insufficient the adjusted spps after bias correction obtained a higher nash sutcliffe efficiency nse than gauge data when driving streamflow simulation the unadjusted spps hydrological applicability was significantly enhanced after bias correction with nse 0 except for imerg product and nse 0 34 before and after correction respectively performance of the tmpa series improved the most through bias correction making it the preferred choice for daily and monthly simulations additionally spps were more applicable in wet and normal years and require improvement in dry years this study provides valuable references for identifying better alternative precipitation sources for local water resource management and exploring an effective spp utilization approach in practical applications graphical abstract ga1 keywords satellite precipitation products hydrological simulation swat northeastern china 1 introduction precipitation is the most important driving factor of the terrestrial hydrological cycles and is a primary contributor to uncertainties in hydrological fluxes and state predictions le et al 2020 sangati and borga 2009 as such accurate precipitation observations or estimations are crucial for hydrograph prediction flood forecasting drought monitoring and water resource allocation and management nguyen et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 conventionally ground gauges are the primary approach to obtaining precipitation anagnostou et al 2009 yuan et al 2018 however due to financial or topographical limitations ground based precipitation observations are usually infrequent or nonexistent in numerous areas worldwide particularly in developing countries and remote regions yu et al 2019 recently satellite precipitation products hereafter spps have been rapidly developed and have exhibited unprecedented values in providing spatiotemporally continuous precipitation estimates darko et al 2021 khatakho et al 2021 tang et al 2020 many spps such as tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa huffman et al 2007 global precipitation measurement gpm integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm products imerg hou et al 2014 and precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks perisiann hsu et al 1997 have shown promising abilities in capturing spatiotemporal variabilities in precipitation as well as in driving hydrological simulations lakew et al 2020 sirisena et al 2018 yuan et al 2018 however given that climate and topography significantly affect the quality of spps bitew and gebremichael 2011 it is necessary to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of satellite based precipitation estimates and their feasibilities in driving hydrological simulations in different regions of the world each spp contains various versions which can be divided into two categories i e gauge adjusted and gauge unadjusted it is well accepted that the gauge adjusted products are more accurate than their unadjusted versions as they have been systematically corrected by global ground gauge networks e g the gpcc global precipitation climatology centre and gpcp global precipitation climatology project le et al 2020 however the effectiveness of such global scale adjustment still needs to be verified for areas not covered by the global gauge network for unadjusted products although being released timely the estimation error of precipitation magnitudes is much more considerable than the adjusted versions jiang et al 2016 satgé et al 2021 it should be noted that the near real time released unadjusted spps have incomparable values in time sensitive hydrological applications such as flood forecasting and warning therefore manual correction for unadjusted spps is essential to enhance their adequacy in hydrological applications previous studies have proposed various methods to correct satellite precipitation estimates using ground based observations such as the monthly bias correction method yuan et al 2017 the geographical adjustment model zhang et al 2019 and the error decomposition method chaudhary and dhanya 2021 among them the monthly bias correction method is more suitable for sparsely gauged areas due to its lower requirement for ground observation and satisfactory performance hashemi et al 2017 valdés pineda et al 2016 hydrological models are practical tools for quantitatively evaluating the abilities of spps in hydrological applications for this purpose various hydrological models have been cooperatively applied with multiple spps jiang et al 2018 khatakho et al 2021 xu et al 2022 among which the soil and water assessment tool swat is one of the most widely used models the swat model has well established physical mechanisms of hydrological cycle processes and a semi distributed computational structure le et al 2020 thus it can adequately characterize the influence of spatial variations in precipitation on the hydrological processes of the basin based on swat modeling numerous studies have conducted in depth analyses in humid or semi humid regions worldwide deng et al 2019 tan et al 2018 vu et al 2018 providing valuable information for understanding the abilities of spps for hydrological applications however the feasibility of spps in driving hydrological simulations in arid or semi arid areas especially under different hydrological conditions has been less studied this may be particularly important for local water resource utilization and flood drought risk assessment especially in data sparse regions this study is focused on a sparsely gauged semi arid region in northeastern china i e the upper taoer river watershed utrw the utrw is formed by the construction of chaersen reservoir which supplies essential water resources for residents and socio economic development accurate representation of precipitation and hydrological variable prediction i e streamflow are vital for local water resource planning and management thus a comprehensive hydrometeorological evaluation was conducted for six spps including the gauge adjusted version and the paired unadjusted version of the tmpa imerg and persiann series the specific objectives are threefold 1 to evaluate the quality of six spps against gauge observations at daily and monthly scales 2 to assess the feasibility of spps in simulating daily and monthly streamflow under different hydrologic conditions and 3 to explore the effects of monthly bias correction on promoting the quality of spps and their feasibilities in hydrological simulation this study can provide valuable guidelines for exploring alternative precipitation data under different hydrological conditions in semi arid or arid areas especially when ground precipitation measurements are inadequate 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the taoer river which originates from the greater khingan mountainous range is the main tributary of the lower nen river in northeastern china the upper taoer river watershed utrw is formed by the construction of chaersen reservoir which is located in the middle reach of the taoer river and has a drainage area of 7780 km2 fig 1 a the utrw has a mid temperate continental monsoon climate with an average annual precipitation of 444 mm of which over 70 occurs during the flood season from june to august the average annual air temperature is 3 3 the elevation of utrw varies from 286 m to 1748 m the land use in utrw was dominated by forest frst and pasture past covering 47 and 41 of the total area respectively other land uses include agricultural land argl 10 surface water watr 1 residential land urld and urhd 1 and wetland wetl 0 1 fig 1 b the soils in this area are dominated by haplic luvisols lvh 55 and calcaric phaeozems phc 18 as shown in fig 1 c the chaersen reservoir plays a vital role in regional disaster prevention water supply and ecological protection with a total storage capacity of 12 53 108 m3 the chaersen reservoir is designed to protect approximately 6 million people from flood disasters covering a total protective area of 4670 km2 additionally it supplies water for the 665 km2 of irrigated land in the downstream region and several national wetland reserves e g xianghai and momoge therefore accurate prediction of hydrological components of utrw is essential for the rational allocation and regulation of water resources 2 2 data 2 2 1 ground data daily ground gauge hereafter gauge precipitation data from 2001 to 2017 were downloaded from the china meteorological administration cma http data cma cn as shown in fig 1 a there is only one meteorological station located within the watershed i e suolun station sl 121 2 e 46 6 n and there are two stations located approximately 10 km wulanhaote wlht 122 1 e 46 1 n and 29 km aershan aes 119 9 e 47 2 n away from the watershed precipitation records from the three gauges were used as benchmarks for further assessment of spps accuracy and hydrological applicability the gauge precipitation was recorded by two subperiods i e utc universal time coordinated 12 utc 00 and utc 00 utc 12 to maintain temporal consistency with spp estimates i e utc 00 utc 24 gauge data were calculated as the sum of precipitation records from utc 00 to utc 12 of the current day and utc 12 to utc 00 of the next day the monthly precipitation was then aggregated from the daily records in addition multiple categories of data were collected to establish the swat model meteorological data i e daily wind speed air temperature and relative humidity at the sl wlht and aes meteorological stations fig 1 from 2001 to 2017 were collected from cma daily inflows of the chaersen reservoir cr station from 1955 to 2017 were obtained from the chaersen reservoir administration hydrological frequency curves were plotted using the entire time series to define annual runoff frequency levels i e wet normal and dry years while data from 2001 to 2017 were used in the calibration and validation of the hydrological simulation geographical data including topography land use and soil type were also required for modeling the 90 m digital elevation model data dem were obtained from the national aeronautics and space administration shuttle radar topographic mission http srtm csi cgiar org land use and soil type data with a 1 km resolution were both downloaded from the data center for resources and environmental sciences chinese academy of sciences http www resdc cn 2 2 2 satellite precipitation products three spp series were assessed in this study i e tmpa imerg and persiann each series contains both gauge adjusted and gauge unadjusted versions the spatial temporal characteristics of all ssps are summarized in table 1 tmpa was designed to provide a calibration based sequential scheme for combining precipitation estimates from various satellites and gauges huffman et al 2007 two major products of the latest version were selected in this study i e the post real time version i e 3b42v7 and the near real time version i e 3b42v7rt the former is calibrated by the gpcc precipitation gauge data all tmpa products are available at the goddard earth sciences data and information services center website https gsfc nasa gov daily precipitation records of tmpa 3b42v7 hereafter tmpa v7 and tmpa 3b42v7rt hereafter tmpa v7rt are aggregated from the 3 hourly data and cover a time span of utc 00 utc 24 data from 2001 to 2017 were used for assessment the gpm mission was developed as a successor and advance of the trmm mission the imerg is a level 3 algorithm that combines all microwave sensors in the constellation and infrared based observations from geosynchronous satellites hou et al 2014 imerg provides three levels of products i e the near real time early and late run products and the post real time final run product the final version is more accurate with the adjustment of the gpcc product the two latest daily products were involved in this study i e gpm imerg early run version 6 hereafter imerg e and gpm imerg final run version 6 hereafter imerg f data were obtained from the national aeronautics and space administration nasa website https pmm nasa gov data access downloads gpm the daily precipitation data from 2001 to 2017 with a time span of utc 00 utc 24 were generated by aggregating data from 48 half hourly imerg products persiann was developed at the center for hydrometeorology and remote sensing chrs at the university of california irvine hsu et al 1997 perdiann adopted a neural network approach to derive relationships between infrared data and rain rates and then applied them to generate precipitation estimates persiann cdr hereafter p cdr is the adjusted version of persiann using the gpcp product version 2 2 ashouri et al 2015 in this study the daily p cdr and persiann data from 2001 to 2017 were acquired from the chrs official website http chrsdata eng uci edu with a time span of utc 00 utc 24 3 methodology 3 1 monthly bias correction although tmpa v7 imerg f and p cdr are all gauge adjusted versions their qualities remained to be improved as there were no gauges involved in the global ground gauge networks e g gpcc and gpcp as such to eliminate the biases of both adjusted and unadjusted spps the monthly bias correction method which is friendly to less gauged areas yuan et al 2017 was employed 1 p sat corr x y i p sat x y i k i 2 k i p gau i p sat x g y g i where p sat corr x y i is the bias corrected spp estimates of the grid x y in month i p sat x y i represents the precipitation estimate for month i of the grid x y of spps p gau i and p sat x g y g i are gauge precipitation data for month i and spp precipitation estimates respectively of the grid x g y g where the gauge is located and k i is the monthly correction coefficient in month i for each spp k i was computed based on the gauge precipitation data and the satellite precipitation data of the grid where the rain gauge is located as expressed in eq 2 and then k i was applied to all satellite grids over the study region eq 1 3 2 swat application the swat model was adopted in this study to investigate the feasibility of different spps for driving hydrological simulation swat is a well established semi distributed ecohydrological model operating at daily monthly or yearly steps arnold et al 1998 the model describes the hydrological process as a two component system i e land hydrology and channel hydrology the hydrological response unit hru is the minimum element to calculate the hydrological processes in the swat model all hydrological processes are separately predicted for each hru and then routed to each sub basin and subsequently to the entire watershed detailed information on the swat model is described in arnold et al 2012 the utrw was delineated into 30 sub basins containing 336 hrus with threshold values of 5 for land use 20 for soil types and 20 for slope daily meteorological data i e precipitation air temperature wind speed and relative humidity were used to drive the model in this study seven precipitation datasets i e gauge tmpa v7 imerg f p cdr tmpa v7rt imerg e and persiann were used to force the daily and monthly streamflow simulations the grid center of spp was assumed to be the virtual meteorological station and was used to drive the model for each simulation run model parameters were independently calibrated by fitting the simulated streamflow to the observed data at the cr station auto calibration for model parameters was performed by the sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm sufi 2 ver 2 in swat cup software abbaspour et al 2007 23 sensitive parameters were selected for model calibration see table s1 in the supplementary materials parameter ranges were identified based on the accepted model manual and reference han and zheng 2016 the entire simulation period from 2001 to 2017 was divided into a warm up period 2001 2003 a calibration period 2004 2011 and a validation period 2012 2017 the optimized parameter values for each precipitation input were separately calibrated at daily and monthly scales see figs s1 and s2 in the supplementary materials 3 3 performance assessment the accuracy of spps versus gauge observations was evaluated using statistical and categorical metrics for the statistical assessment the correlation coefficient cc root mean square error rmse and relative bias rb were applied to assess the performances of the spp datasets in capturing the temporal dynamics of gauge precipitation for the categorical assessment the abilities of spps in detecting precipitation events were evaluated by the probability of detection pod false alarm ratio far and critical success index csi the precipitation and non precipitation events were differentiated with a threshold of 1 mm day according to previous studies yong et al 2010 table 2 lists the formulae ranges and optimal values of the evaluation indices the assessment was based on the grid scale that is the grids where the aes sl and wlht meteorological stations are located were selected to present spp performance the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and percent bias pb were utilized moriasi et al 2007 nash and sutcliffe 1970 to assess the performance in hydrological simulation an nse value between 0 and 1 generally indicates acceptable performance whereas values below 0 suggest that the mean observed value is a better predictor than the simulated value pointing to unacceptable performance moriasi et al 2007 as shown in table 3 four model performance ranks i e very good good satisfactory and unsatisfactory were assigned for the acceptable values of nse and pb in addition a model performance score mps was defined to evaluate the performance of different precipitation datasets in driving the hydrological simulation nse and pb in very good good satisfactory and unsatisfactory levels were assigned 5 points 4 points 3 points and 1 point respectively and mps was the summation of the nse and pb points note that mps was counted as 0 when either nse 0 or pb 50 occurred 4 results 4 1 evaluation of spps 4 1 1 daily precipitation the abilities of all six spps in characterizing the gauge precipitation were assessed fig 2 displays the scatter plots of precipitation data of spps versus gauge and the comparison indices generally the gauge adjusted products i e tmpa v7 imerg f and p cdr demonstrated better fits with gauge observations than the unadjusted products i e tmpa v7rt imerg e and persiann as indicated by the relatively higher cc smaller rmse and smaller rb values for tmpa and imerg series the discrepancy was particularly remarkable for the rb index of tmpa series which was 12 8 for tmpa v7 and 65 9 for tmpa v7rt the imerg series exhibited the best performance among the three spp series for the gauge adjusted products fig 2 a c imerg f has the highest cc 0 60 smallest rmse 3 8 mm and smallest rb 2 1 in the statistical assessment and the smallest far 0 43 and highest csi 0 42 in the categorical assessment a similar advantage of imerg e was also observed among the unadjusted products fig 2 d f the tmpa and persiann series showed comparable performances specifically the tmpa series had a better ability to detect precipitation events as indicated by the higher pod only for tmpa v7rt smaller far and higher csi while the perisiann series was more accurate in terms of the precipitation magnitude as indicated by the smaller values of rmse and rb indices fig 3 displays the plots of bias corrected spps hereafter denoted by spp corr see section 3 1 for details versus gauge precipitation data the results indicated that bias correction efficiently improved the estimate accuracy for all spps in terms of the statistical metrics the improvement from bias correction was particuarly significant for the unadjusted products i e tmpa v7rt imerg e and persiann the rb significantly decreased from 4 4 65 9 fig 2 d f to 0 1 0 2 fig 3 d f and cc and rmse also improved slightly after correction among the three unadjusted spps the improvement of tmpa v7rt corr appeared to be the most prominent where the cc increased from 0 47 to 0 49 rmse decreased from 6 0 mm to 4 3 mm and rb decreased from 65 9 to 0 0 overall the imerg corr series had the best accuracy in precipitation estimates among the three spp corr series the bias correction significantly reduced the systematic errors of the tmpa series resulting in the overall superior performance of the tmpa corr series to the persiann corr series the far for all spp cases was approximately 0 5 figs 2 and 3 indicating that nearly half of the precipitation events detected by spps were false alarms the pod values below 0 7 also revealed that at least 30 of the precipitation events were missed by the spps fortunately approximately 90 of the false alarms were light precipitation events 0 10 mm d and less than 3 were heavy precipitation events 25 mm d for more information on the occurrence percentage of false alarms see fig s3 in the supplementary material the misreports all occurred for light precipitation events 0 10 mm d thus the false alarms and misreports of spps in light precipitation events may not cause significant uncertainty in hydrological applications 4 1 2 monthly precipitation the monthly precipitation of spps was only assessed for their statistical performance because the categorical indices of all spps are equivalent to their optimal values when the accumulated monthly precipitation for all months is larger than 1 mm fig 4 shows the scatter plots of monthly precipitation from the spps before and after bias correction versus the gauge observations overall the correlations between the spp datasets and gauge data significantly improved as the time aggregated from the daily to the monthly scale indicating the satisfactory abilities of spps in characterizing the monthly precipitation variations among the three spp series the imerg series exhibited the best performance compared with the other two series which have higher cc values 0 92 of imerg f and 0 84 of imerg e and smaller rmse 19 2 mm and 28 7 mm and rb values 2 1 and 11 6 for the tmpa and persiann series the tmpa series showed firmer consistency with gauge data indicated by higher cc values while the persiann series had small systematic errors indicated by smaller rb values similar to the daily scale bias correction effectively improved the quality of spps in depicting monthly precipitation variations for the adjusted spps the rmse and rb values decreased from 21 8 mm to 21 0 mm and from 7 8 to 0 1 on average respectively before and after bias correction while the cc value was almost unchanged i e 0 90 and 0 89 on average compared with the adjusted spps the bias correction demonstrated a more significant role in improving the quality of unadjusted spps the average cc rmse and rb values of the three unadjusted products were 0 85 25 2 mm and 0 1 respectively after bias correction fig 4 d f overall our results suggested an adequate ability of bias correction in enhancing the quality of spps especially in reducing the systematic error of unadjusted products 4 2 evaluation of streamflow simulation 4 2 1 daily streamflow simulation fig 5 shows the simulated daily hydrographs of the cr station driven by different precipitation datasets including the gauge data and the raw and corrected datasets of six spps along with the corresponding statistical indices during the entire simulation period table s2 in the supplementary materials summarizes the respective indices for the calibration and validation periods the gauge based model acquired a satisfactory nse of 0 52 and a very good pb of 0 1 during the entire period for spps all the adjusted product based models achieved better performances than the gauge based model in terms of nse although with remarkable systematic errors among the three adjusted spps imerg f performed the best in predicting daily hydrographs nse of 0 59 and pb of 14 followed by tmpa v7 nse of 0 56 and pb of 23 5 and p cdr nse of 0 57 and pb of 42 2 unfortunately the unadjusted spps showed very poor feasibility in predicting daily streamflow simulations forced by tmpa v7rt and persiann both had unacceptable nse below 0 and pb around 50 although the model using imerg e obtained a small pb of 2 2 the nse was only 0 30 the results indicated that bias correction improved the feasibilities of all adjusted spps in driving hydrological simulation fig 5 b d driven by raw spps to corrected spps nse values of streamflow simulation improved from 0 57 to 0 62 on average and the systematic error decreased from 26 6 to 11 7 on average specifically the simulation using tmpa v7 corr exhibited the highest value of nse 0 67 followed by p cdr corr 0 61 and imerg f corr 0 59 while imerg f corr derived the smallest pb 2 2 followed by tmpa v7 corr 8 2 and p cdr corr 24 6 the performances of unadjusted spps were also improved after bias correction which achieved at least acceptable results in forcing daily streamflow simulations specifically tmpa v7rt corr showed the most remarkable improvement in driving the daily simulation with an nse of 0 61 and a pb of 12 which was superior or comparable to the gauge based model and several adjusted spp corr based models i e imerg f corr and p cdr corr noting that near real time spps are vital in time sensitive water resource regulation scenarios our results suggested that bias correction could broaden the applicability of unadjusted spps in early warning systems e g flood forecasting and landslide prediction 4 2 2 monthly streamflow simulation fig 6 displays the monthly hydrographs predicted by various precipitation datasets table s3 in the supplementary materials summarizes the performance indices for the calibration and validation periods in general model performance improved from the daily to the monthly scale which is consistent with previous studies khatakho et al 2021 zhu et al 2018 the adjusted spp based models gained better performances than the gauge based model in terms of nse 0 78 for tmpa v7 0 78 for p cdr 0 73 for imerg f versus 0 73 for gauge for pb tmpa v7 produced comparable systematic errors against gauge 6 0 for tmpa v7 versus 4 1 for gauge while imerg f and p cdr both led to an underestimation of streamflow with pb of 25 6 and 26 6 respectively among the unadjusted products fig 6 e g imerg e performed more promisingly in predicting monthly streamflow as indicated by a satisfactory nse of 0 52 and a good pb of 11 3 but still had much room for improvement compared to gauge and adjusted products tmpa v7rt and persiann showed poor feasibility in driving monthly streamflow simulation with unacceptable nse nse 0 and remarkable bias pb 75 for the spp corr driven simulations the nse and pb scores significantly improved the nse value of the three adjusted spp corr based models increased from 0 77 to 0 81 on average and the systematic error was reduced from 19 4 to 6 4 fig 6 the unadjusted spp corr based models also achieved at least acceptable performances in monthly simulation defined as nse 0 and pb 50 overall the tmpa series benefited the most from bias correction enabling the tmpa corr data to outperform other spps corr and gauge in the monthly hydrological application the tmpa v7 corr based model obtained the highest nse 0 85 and the smallest pb 5 9 among the adjusted spps corr and tmpa v7rt corr also showed superior feasibility among the unadjusted spps corr with a very good nse 0 78 and a good pb 9 6 for the persiann corr and imerg corr series p cdr corr and imerg f corr based models obtained comparable performances nse 0 80 for p cdr corr versus 0 77 for imerg f corr pb 6 8 versus 6 4 while imerg e corr showed better performance than persiann corr with a higher nse 0 57 for imerg e corr versus 0 48 for persiann corr and a smaller pb 7 5 versus 21 the above evaluation results revealed the feasibility of different spps in driving hydrological simulation both for the raw and corrected spps for the raw spps without bias correction it was found that the imerg series had an overall better performance than the tmpa and persiann series especially for their unadjusted versions after bias correction all spps showed improved performances in driving hydrological simulation at both daily and monthly scales the improvement was particularly significant for unadjusted spps e g tmpa v7rt obtained the most predominant improvement comparing the spp with gauge based models it was found that quite a few spp based models outperformed the gauge based model in terms of nse for streamflow simulation including all the raw and corrected adjusted products and the unadjusted product of tmpa v7rt corr in summary our results suggested an optimistic use of spps as an alternative data source to gauge observations for non or sparsely gauged areas however manual correction procedure such as monthly bias correction is necessary to improve the quality of spps especially the near real time unadjusted versions 4 2 3 performance at different annual runoff frequencies an in depth understanding of the spp applicability under different hydrologic conditions is of practical value for guiding spp utilization for different water resource management purposes e g flood warning and drought mitigation for this purpose the entire 14 year simulation period was divided into three annual runoff frequency f ar levels according to the hydrological frequency curve of the cr station i e wet years f ar 37 5 including 2012 2013 and 2015 normal years 37 5 f ar 62 5 including 2005 2011 and 2014 and dry years f ar 62 5 including 2004 2006 2010 2016 and 2017 fig 7 displays the model performance based on 13 precipitation datasets including gauge and raw and corrected spps for wet normal and dry years the gauge based model serves as the benchmark for comparison which exhibited superior performance in wet years nse values were 0 47 and 0 73 and pb values were 1 8 and 6 4 for daily and monthly streamflow simulations respectively fig 7 while in normal years the gauge based model overestimated streamflow by more than 25 at both daily and monthly scales and in dry years it underestimated streamflow by more than 20 daily scale only for the six raw spps imerg f and p cdr exhibited better performances than tmpa v7 during wet years in daily streamflow prediction with nses of 0 59 and 0 63 and pbs of 21 7 and 25 5 respectively tmpa v7 behaved the best in normal years nse 0 47 pb 11 9 and imerg f behaved the best in dry years nse 0 35 pb 9 7 for the monthly simulation p cdr obtained the most potent consistency with observed streamflow in wet and dry years with nses of 0 82 and 0 37 respectively tmpa v7 yielded the highest nse of 0 88 in normal years and the smallest systematic error with rb values of 7 3 3 3 and 12 4 in wet normal and dry years respectively however all the unadjusted spps yielded unacceptable or unsatisfactory nse values 0 5 under three hydrological levels for both daily and monthly streamflow simulations except for imerg e in normal years in particular persiann produced the most remarkable systematic errors pb 40 the model performances driven by spp corr were significantly improved under different hydrologic conditions annotated with the red upward arrow in fig 7 among the six corrected spps the tmpa v7 corr based model obtained the best performance in predicting both daily and monthly streamflow in wet normal and dry years the performance of the tmpa v7rt corr based model in the wet and normal years greatly improved after bias correction which was comparable to or even surpassed its adjusted version tmpa v7 corr however it was found that manual bias correction can also result in worse model performance annotated with the black downward arrow in fig 7 for example tmpa v7 corr imerg f corr and p cdr corr exhibited lower nses in normal years and tmpa v7 corr and imerg e corr showed larger pbs in dry years than their raw versions the mps score see section 3 3 was further calculated to evaluate the overall model performance driven by various precipitation datasets under different hydrological conditions as shown in fig 8 the gauge based model obtained moderate performance in wet and dry years the mps scores were 6 8 points for daily monthly simulation in wet years and 4 8 points in dry years while the performance in normal years was poor for the spps including both raw and corrected versions the average mps was 6 8 points in wet years and 5 7 points in normal years for daily monthly simulation however there remained much room for improvement in the dry year simulation 3 and 4 points on average for daily and monthly simulations respectively although the gauge based model is usually employed in water resource management the spp based models on some occasions were found to exhibit better performances among the 12 spp based models including raw and corrected versions 42 5 in number 75 9 in number and 25 3 in number had comparable or higher mps than gauge based model during wet normal and dry years respectively for daily streamflow simulation and 60 7 in number 83 10 in number and 0 0 in number for monthly simulation such results indicated the considerable potential of spps in forcing hydrological simulations particularly in wet and normal years 5 discussion 5 1 effectiveness of monthly bias correction the spp accuracy in precipitation estimates was closely associated with regional meteorological conditions such as humidity and precipitation magnitude zhang et al 2020 the uncertainties of precipitation estimates were then propagated to streamflow predictions through the hydrological model process li et al 2018 xu et al 2022 as reported by previous studies the performance of spps in hydrological simulations is generally poorer in arid or semi arid areas than in humid areas yu et al 2020 2021 indeed in the semi arid utrw tmpa v7rt showed unacceptable performance in driving streamflow simulation nse 0 fig 5 e and 6 e while achieved at least unsatisfactory nse values 0 nse 0 5 in the humid huifa river basin in northeast china zhu et al 2018 therefore the spp accuracy and applicability need to be thoroughly evaluated and enhanced before its hydrological use in such arid or semi arid areas wherein a manual correction procedure may be necessary especially for the near real time unadjusted spps the results demonstrated that bias correction efficiently reduced the systematic errors of all six spps involved in this study and improved the applicability of spps in hydrological simulation especially for the unadjusted spps figs 3 and 4 although it is recognized that the unadjusted products generally perform inferior to the adjusted products in predicting hydrographs the bias correction procedure can help the unadjusted product e g tmpa v7rt achieve comparable performance to that of the adjusted version in the utrw figs 5 and 6 our study emphasized the necessity and efficiency of bias correction in promoting the widespread application of the unadjusted spps in time sensitive hydrological practices especially in sparsely gauged areas the tmpa series was found to benefit the most from bias correction in terms of the data accuracy and the feasibility in driving hydrological simulation with nse scores of 0 67 and 0 85 for daily and monthly simulations respectively and pb scores of 8 2 and 5 9 respectively fig 5 e and 6 e however bias correction may worsen spp performance in some cases annotated with black downward arrows in fig 7 spp performance was degraded mainly in normal and dry years indicating higher uncertainties of bias correction during the medium to low flow period considering the simple procedure and broad applicability of the bias correction method it is still recommended for improving the feasibility of spps in hydrological applications in less or non gauged areas while exploring an advanced correction method to provide higher quality spp dataset is worthwhile especially for the low flow periods in semi arid areas 5 2 prospects and challenges of spps in hydrological applications in semi arid areas the ground gauge system in the utrw was insufficient to reflect the spatial variability of precipitation which hindered the accurate prediction of hydrological processes fig 5 a and 6 a seven spps e g all the raw and corrected adjusted spps and corrected unadjusted tmpa v7rt exhibited superior performances in terms of nse in driving the hydrological simulation in the utrw compared to the gauge data our results suggested a broad prospect of spps especially bias corrected spps for hydrological application in sparsely gauged areas owing to their advantage in capturing the spatial variation of precipitation nevertheless the performance of the spp based model in daily streamflow simulation was not quite satisfactory the raw spp based models generally had a relatively weak agreement with the measured streamflow nse 0 67 and the spp corr based models considerably underestimated streamflow pb 41 1 which may cause risks in flood forecasting or disaster prevention application the daily streamflow simulation may be easily affected by anthropogenic regulations such as reservoir operation and water withdrawal or discharge however there are few medium or large reservoirs upstream of the taoer river liu et al 2020 and agricultural activities were not very intense with only 10 of the land used for agricultural planting in the utrw fig 1 b as such the relatively poor quality of daily spp estimates cc 0 6 figs 2 and 3 may be the main cause of the inferior performance of daily streamflow simulation a practical approach to improve the quality of daily spp estimates in semi arid areas is worthy of more attention in future studies this study further showed that the performance of spps in driving hydrological simulation differed under different hydrologic conditions i e wet normal and dry years the spp based models exhibited better performances in wet and normal years but behaved inferiorly in dry years fig 8 thus it is better to consider the hydrological condition before using spp and it remains a challenge to apply spp for hydrological application during dry years in arid or semi arid areas it is hoped that a comprehensive improvement of the precipitation data quality the correction method effectiveness and the model structure will be realized shortly to strengthen the hydrological simulation performance especially for the dry period 6 conclusions this study comprehensively evaluated the accuracy and feasibility of six spps including the adjusted and unadjusted products of the tmpa imerg and persiann series in hydrometeorological applications in the upper taoer river watershed northeastern china the bias correction method was applied to the spps to explore its effectiveness in improving the spps abilities in precipitation estimation and hydrological utility the results indicated that for a specific spp series the adjusted product offered more accurate precipitation estimation and was more capable of hydrological simulations than the unadjusted product among the three spp series the imerg series showed the best performance in both meteorological and hydrological assessments followed by the tmpa and persiann series additionally the bias correction is proven to be an effective approach to improve the accuracy of spps especially for unadjusted products the corrected imerg series performed better in depicting precipitation patterns while the corrected tmpa series obtained the best performance in both daily and monthly streamflow predictions in general for local water resource management in the utrw and regions with similar hydrological climatic and geological conditions the imerg series is found to be more reliable in daily streamflow prediction tmpa v7 and imerg e are recommended for monthly applications as the post real time and near real time products respectively once the gauge observations are available for a basal manual correction the bias corrected tmpa products are the first choice for both daily and monthly streamflow simulations however considering that the behaviors of spps are poorer in dry years than in wet or normal years it remains a challenge to apply spps for hydrological applications in dry periods which needs to be strengthened by relying on more accurate spps more efficient correction methods and improved model structures in future studies credit authorship contribution statement lu zhang conceptualization methodology formal analysis writing original

7876,study region the study was tested in jefferson county in illinois usa whose land use is a typical representation of row crop cultivation in the midwestern usa study focus this study aimed to predict the gully erosion susceptibility in agricultural land using remote sensed environmental data topographic pedologic land cover precipitation and vegetation development considering their spatio temporal variability in a modeling framework based on the maximum entropy model maxent the methodology thoroughly evaluated each environmental factor contributing to gully erosion prediction and used a set of rules based on accuracy transferability and efficiency to evaluate the model performance new hydrological insights for the region this study developed a data driven modeling framework that can be applied across other regions the modeling framework indicates that fifteen factors were the most relevant for developing the gully erosion susceptibility map where 7 4 of the agricultural land in the study area was found at elevated risk of developing gully erosion slope land cover organic matter seasonal lai and maximum daily precipitation were the most contributing environmental factors to the study area furthermore this study identified the importance of high temporal resolution in varying seasonal factors i e leaf area index and precipitation to improve model predictability

authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction soil erosion is the detachment mobilization and deposition of soil particles occurring asymmetrically across landscapes and streams by wind or water under the combination of complex processes in general soil erosion by water also known as water erosion can be classified into three processes following its development sheet rill and gully erosion among the three gully erosion has been regarded as the most severe phase frankl et al 2013 zegeye et al 2017 forming large channels that are challenging to manage with conventional agricultural machinery decreasing crop production cama et al 2020 as a result once gullies are developed their management is challenging lengthy and costly in this regard designing and implementing proactive measures to prevent gully formation became critical thereby predicting the probable locations of gully formation the first step in directing conservation strategies popp et al 2000 conoscenti et al 2014 a variety of studies on predicting gully erosion have been attempted through many physical based models including creams chemicals runoff and erosion from agricultural management systems egem ephemeral gully erosion mode mike she and wepp water erosion prediction project knisel 1980 flanagan and nearing 1995 refsgaard and knudsen 1996 woodward 1999 these models require extensive input data e g climate topography soil and time series of detailed farm operation information that are not commonly available in addition these models cannot integrate the necessary spatio temporal resolution of data and surface dynamics to simulate the entire process accurately on large scales nor evaluate gully erosion susceptibility due to the computational complexity and the insufficient understanding of gully formation pourghasemi et al 2017 vanmaercke et al 2021 due to these drawbacks of physical based models there is a need for computational tools to efficiently predict gully erosion across the local regional and global scales finding a good balance between accurate process representation feasible data requirements and computational capacity vanmaercke et al 2016 bauer et al 2021 as alternatives data driven or probabilistic statistical approaches based on machine learning models have become widely applied to estimate gully susceptibility angileri et al 2016 rahmati et al 2017 arabameri et al 2020a cama et al 2020 these approaches can solve problems with scarce data with lesser expertise to reproduce the aimed outputs amiri et al 2019 among many machine learning models the maximum entropy maxent model has been widely used to predict environmental issues including gully erosion leblanc et al 2005 davis and sims 2013 dube et al 2014 xu et al 2020 although it was initially developed to study habitat suitability by determining the probability of the presence of species phillips et al 2006 most of the previous research on gully susceptibility prediction mainly focused on steady state variables in time e g topographic and pedologic factors without accounting for the temporal variability of significant factors pertinent to gully erosion such as precipitation and surface cover bou kheir et al 2007 li and mccarty 2018 li et al 2018 zabihi et al 2018 although some studies applied temporal factors including precipitation and the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi botero acosta et al 2017 pourghasemi et al 2017 arabameri et al 2020b the values of temporal factors in their research were on an annual basis and this temporal scale is inappropriate to reflect the seasonal variability of drivers that can exacerbate or mitigate gully development gomez gutierrez et al 2009 in this regard the main objective of this study was to develop a framework to predict the geospatial location of gully erosion in agricultural lands accounting for the spatio temporal changes in environmental conditions specifically this study was geared to 1 develop a modeling framework that integrates environmental factors driving gully erosion at a high spatial and temporal resolution and 2 develop and evaluate maxent models to identify the environmental factors that are theoretical and computationally efficient to estimate gully susceptibility and 3 create a gully erosion susceptibility map and evaluate its linkage with the environmental features 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the modeling framework was developed tested and evaluated in jefferson county illinois usa located in the southern part of illinois covering 1512 km2 fig 1a rolling topography is found across the county with local relief of about 15 m upland prairies are flat to moderately hilly and shallow valleys leighton et al 1948 from east to the west three fourths of the county area lies in the big muddy river watershed draining towards the rend lake at jefferson and franklin counties leighton et al 1948 fitzjerrells and lueker 2009 the rend lake dam is used for flood control water supply recreation fish and wildlife as a stimulus for economic redevelopment nieto and donath 1976 siltation and water quality have been of great importance the climate in jefferson county is characterized by hot dry summers ranging from 15 c to 32 c and cold wet winters ranging from 6 4 c noaa 2020 precipitation follows a bimodal pattern with peaks in may and november and a total annual average precipitation of 1117 6 mm fig 1b the most rainfall happens during spring middle mar jun 30 while 20 occurs during the fall season middle sep dec the major land uses in jefferson county are agriculture 59 forest 27 urban 10 and water 4 based on the 2012 cropland data layer cdl product of the u s department of agriculture usda national agricultural statistics service nass boryan et al 2011 with agricultural areas dominated by row crop production corn and soybean the area of this study serves to characterize the agricultural activity in the corn belt region dominated by intense row crop production across corn soybean and wheat crops with similarities in soil genesis and land management practices 2 2 maximum entropy model maxent the maxent model is based on the maximum entropy theory with a machine learning approach applying a presence only algorithm modeling phenomenon when information about their absence is insufficient or unattainable merow et al 2013 maxent uses a set of presence data of a phenomenon e g gully erosion and a set of environmental factors to spatially predict an unknown probability distribution however maxent can suffer selection bias as sample collection is often spatially biased toward easily accessed areas to measure or observe a target variable here gully erosion phillips et al 2009 the approach proposed by this study is not affected by this issue as gully locations were detected using remotely sensed data which is not limited to location access in maxent a given space x is represented in discrete grids where x i represents the cell in the x domain where a targeting phenomenon e g gully erosion has been observed phillips et al 2004 the most contributing environmental variable was allocated to each cell x i in which the probability of occurrence p x called the relative occurrence rate ror was calculated using eq 1 1 pz x i e λ z x i i e λ z x i where z is a vector of the predictor at location x i and λ is a vector of regression coefficients the calculated rors are normalized values consequently their sum over the study area equals 1 the maxent model employs the receiver operating characteristic roc curves and the auc area under the roc curve to evaluate model performance a roc analysis shows how sensitivity true positive rate changes against specificity 1 false positive rate over a series of thresholds which can be summarized by an auc muschelli 2019 an auc ranging from 0 5 to 0 6 is considered poor while values closer to 1 are considered a more reliable metric performance when predicting the probability of the phenomenon s presence here gully erosion rahmati et al 2017 more details on the mathematical process can be found in phillips et al 2004 and phillips and dudík 2008a 2 3 methodology the study was divided into four main parts fig 2 first a gully erosion inventory map was created by subtracting two light detection and ranging lidar derived digital elevation models dems the differences in elevation were then filtered for noise and those exceeding a given threshold were used as the presence of gully erosion in the maxent model second the environmental factors controlling gullies were identified based on literature and re constructed using the different data sources the importance of all factors was then investigated by performing the permutation test and the major driving factors within each factor group topography pedology land cover and precipitation were selected objective 1 third a series of the maxent models were developed with different combinations of the selected major factors among which the best environmental factors were determined objective 2 lastly using the model with the best factor set a gully erosion susceptibility map was developed and the geospatial attributes of susceptible areas were explored objective 3 the details about each process are described in the following sections 2 3 1 gully erosion inventory mapping the gully erosion inventory in agricultural lands based on the crop data layer cdl in 2012 was mapped using two lidar derived dems at a 2 m 2012 and 1 m 2015 resolution assuming that agricultural areas and cultivated crops in 2012 were maintained until 2015 the two dems corrected to eliminate human made structures or vegetations were obtained from the illinois state geological survey isgs https clearinghouse isgs illinois edu the identification of gully erosion was derived from the difference in elevations between the two dems martínez casasnovas et al 2002 evans and lindsay 2010 using a 2 m grid resolution the paved road e bonnie rd elevation in rend lake red dot in fig 1a was used as a reference for the dem calibration assuming no elevation change happened on this road between 2012 and 2015 ten points were randomly chosen and the average difference in elevation between two dems was regarded as a noise caused by the inherent discrepancies between the two lidar datasets the average elevation difference of the ten points was 6 2 cm and was subtracted from the difference between the two dems a threshold value of 50 cm was applied to consider the presence of gully erosion only laflen et al 1986 laflen and shaw 1988 because the processed dem map may also contain sheet and rill erosion the 50 cm depth was estimated based on deep tillage depth e g 33 cm raper et al 2000 and the vertical accuracy of lidar dems approximately 20 cm at a 95 confidence level authority 1998 as lidar s accuracy can be affected by shadows affecting the wavelength intensity of the returned signal from the surface to a sensor a thorough examination was conducted using aerial imageries of 2012 and 2015 acquired from the national agriculture imagery program naip by usda this analysis aimed to remove locations with human activities that result in significant changes in elevation and cloud perturbation e g shadows in the lidar datasets guislain et al 2016 yüksel and boyaci 2018 the final estimated location of gully erosion was transformed into a point dataset to be used as the presence of gully erosion for the maxent model and assumed to represent the probable location of gullies regardless of their size type or stage of development i e both ephemeral and classical or permanent gullies for cross validation 70 of the gully sample points were randomly selected as a training dataset and 30 were used for model validation 2 3 2 construction of environmental factors to consider the spatial temporal effects of the environmental features on gully erosion topographic and pedologic factors were considered stationary factors while land cover and precipitation were used as time varying factors in daily seasonal and annual time series table 1 a set of nine topographic factors and a set of twelve pedologic factors were selected based on literature valentin et al 2005 bou kheir et al 2007 tuo et al 2015 biddoccu et al 2017 botero acosta et al 2017 lenhart et al 2017 li and mccarty 2018 li et al 2018 kariminejad et al 2019 cama et al 2020 topographic factors were extracted from the lidar derived dem of 2012 the pedology factors were extracted from the gridded soil survey geographic gssurgo database nrcs 2021 the gssurgo database a gridded form of the standard usda nrcs soil survey geographic ssurgo database contains the tabular data of various soil properties and derivatives to a state wide extent more details about this dataset can be found in nrcs 2021 the pedologic factors were mapped using the soil data development toolbox using the mukey gssurgo database attribute that links soil attributes to their geolocation note that in this study the representative soil depth for soil mapping was set to the upper 50 cm to consider the impacts of conventional tillage depth etana et al 1999 raper et al 2000 land use and leaf area index lai were selected as land cover factors the annual and seasonal lai were considered to represent the spatio temporal dynamics of the plant canopy lai maps were produced using the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis lai product mcd15a2h from 2012 to 2015 an eight day composite lai data with a spatial resolution of 500 m myneni et al 2015 precipitation factors were mapped using the national centers for environmental prediction ncep stage iv daily precipitation datasets assimilating radar and gauge observations at a 1 km spatial resolution the following factors were computed from 2012 to 2015 to account for the temporal variability of precipitation 1 seasonal average daily precipitation ave p 2 seasonal maximum daily precipitation max p 3 seasonal total precipitation tot p and 4 annual precipitation ann p seasons were defined based on the climate regime and cultural practices as spring march to may summer june to august fall september to november and winter december to february the annual and seasonal factors within the land cover and precipitation factors were compared to identify the temporal effects on gully erosion prediction 2 3 3 relative importance analysis of environmental factors the relative importance of each factor within each factor group was analyzed through a permutation test the permutation test measures the decrease in the accuracy of the final training result caused by the variable s permutation which is normalized as an index for contribution analysis phillips and dudík 2008b regardless of the number of factors within factor groups a threshold value of 0 05 was used to select the significant factors the selection of a threshold value of 0 05 provides a satisfactory feature selection accuracy prasetiyowati et al 2021 in addition the effects of the seasonal variance i e temporal variability in land cover and precipitation factors on gully erosion prediction were investigated based on the analysis of environmental factors the major contributing factors were selected for each factor group 2 3 4 development and evaluation of the gully erosion susceptibility map the multivariate model evaluation was built from baseline variables i e land use slope max p and organic matter incremented by one variable per model and then performed a model evaluation computed the relative degree of importance and the model prediction accuracy the best model was selected based on the following set of rules 1 minimum number of applied variables i e efficiency 2 maximum model performance i e accuracy and 3 minimum auc difference between the training and test i e transferability following the best model selection the probability of gully presence for agricultural lands was estimated and mapped in a 2 2 m spatial resolution and then classified into four susceptibility classes using the natural breaks jenks method the natural breaks method groups data to reduce the variance within classes and maximize the variance between classes jenks 1967 chalkias et al 2014 demonstrated that the natural breaks method is more efficient in susceptibility mapping than other classification methods e g equal interval and standard deviation classifications and it has been the most used in susceptibility assessment chalkias et al 2014 chen et al 2015 sema et al 2017 hong et al 2018 as a final step each factor was evaluated through response curves to assess the change in the estimated probability of gully presence as a function of a change in each factor sensitivity while other factors remain fixed at their average values 3 results and discussions 3 1 gully erosion location in the study area a total of 5621 gully erosion locations in agricultural fields were identified over the study area fig 3a these gully locations were assumed as true gully presences and used as the maxent model s input a visual evaluation of gully locations was conducted using the 2012 and 2015 aerial images to confirm their validity fig 3b e generally gully locations were more pronounced in the southern part of jefferson county near the rend lake reservoir where row crop fields i e corn and soybean are more prevalent than in the northern part table 2 3 2 importance analysis of pedologic and topographic factors the results of the importance analysis of pedologic factors showed that k factor silt content organic matter and awc had a contribution greater than 10 and the k factor had the highest contribution 19 1 to gully prediction fig 4a among twelve factors seven factors with a contribution greater than 5 k factor silt content organic matter awc hsg clay content and t factor were selected in the case of the topography factors the slope acquired the highest contribution 47 2 to gully prediction followed by twi aspect standard curvature and profile curvature fig 4b such high contributions of these factors were found in agreement with previous studies that the slope curvature aspect and twi are reported to show a high association with gully development li and mccarty 2018 li et al 2018 cama et al 2020 the five topographic factors showing a contribution higher than 5 were selected as the primary factors 3 3 temporal effects of the environmental factors on gully prediction the contribution of the seasonal factors was compared with the non seasonal factors e g land use annual lai and annual precipitation in the importance analysis for land cover factors fig 4c the contribution of land use was higher than the annual lai and seasonal lai accounting for approximately 70 of the total contribution such significance of the land use factor was reasonable since gully erosion fig 3 was mainly found in areas with row crop production of corn soybean and winter wheat table 2 furthermore the higher importance of land cover than lai follows existing models accounting for land use and land cover rather than relative vegetation indices such as ndvi and lai this might be because different crops require different cultivation practices e g tillage planting irrigation and some of this information is embedded in land cover data vanmaercke et al 2021 the comparison of the seasonal lai with the annual lai showed that the former s contribution 24 3 was approximately five times greater than the latter s 4 6 fig 4c this difference is because the seasonal lai better represents the spatial heterogeneity of lai distribution than the annual lai the lai in spring and fall in particular had a more heterogeneous distribution than annual lai while lai in summer and winter presented relatively monotonic distributions fig 5 given the dominant contribution of the land use and its correlation with the lai cohen et al 2003 the seasonal lai s high contribution implied that it encoded additional information on the spatial heterogeneity caused by vegetation which the land use dataset does not provide the importance of lai was due in part to farming operations e g tillage planting and harvesting during spring march and april and fall september and october crop growth especially at the early stage varies depending on the conditions of the surrounding environment including soil moisture temperature solar radiation and seed formulation sacks et al 2010 and this led to the most noticeable spatial heterogeneity and the highest contribution 15 7 of the lai in spring fig 5a in contrast summer and winter presented less spatial variation the reason is that row crops in most cases can reach maturity before the end of summer covering the surface until harvest moreover most agricultural fields are bare during winter except for areas planted with cover crops fig 5b d thus seasonal lai reasonably characterized such temporal and spatial changes in the land surface due to agricultural activities all distributions of seasonal precipitation showed spatial and temporal differences fig 6 for example max p during spring and summer was likely to be more intense in the southeast part of the study area but relatively milder in fall and winter such spatio temporal changes in precipitation patterns may lead to a higher contribution of seasonal precipitation factors than annual precipitation fig 4d the max p had the highest contribution among the seasonal factors as precipitation intensity is critical among the various rainfall characteristic descriptors e g duration total depth and frequency such a significant effect of rainfall intensity on gully development has been demonstrated by numerous studies vanmaercke et al 2021 rainfall intensity exacerbates particle detachment and mobilization due to increased raindrop energy and the likelihood of developing concentrated flow vanmaercke et al 2016 in summary land use and seasonal lai in the land cover group and seasonal max p and seasonal tot p in the precipitation group were selected as major contributing factors in predicting the probability of gully erosion 3 4 environmental factors model development and model performance evaluation among all factors with a more significant contribution than 5 land use showed the highest contribution with 20 1 followed by slope max p fall and winter organic matter and awc fig 7 it is noted that each of these factors belongs to a different environmental group implying that each environmental group carries unique information linked to gully erosion development another noteworthy finding is that different factor combinations can change the importance of factors for example the k factor had the lowest importance among the selected pedologic factors however it presented the highest importance when only pedologic factors were compared fig 4a this was explained as a result of collinearity or multicollinearity a situation where two or more predictors are highly associated this factor dependency suggests that even a factor relevant to a one factor group e g topography can provide information to some degree to other factor groups e g soil however it is challenging to reveal the underlying mechanisms and interactions that resulted in the change in the factor importance due to the black box nature of machine learning a well known constraint of machine learning techniques vanmaercke et al 2021 table 3 summarizes the model evaluation and the criteria for model selection it was considered that the higher the number of factors the lower the model efficiency the higher the auc for training and testing the higher the model accuracy and the smaller the auc difference the higher the transferability in general factor incremental led to increased auc for training and test and thereby the training auc reached a plateau value of 0 828 at model mm q beyond the model mm h no significant improvement in accuracy was observed among the models the mma model indicated the highest transferability with an auc difference of 0 004 given the model selection criteria the model mm l was selected as the best factor combination although a direct comparison of the current study with the existing studies is challenging due to the differences in splitting strategies for training test set partitioning spatial resolution and environmental conditions the auc metric can be used for comparison the developed model mml shows better performance than other models developed in previous studies for gully susceptibility using an entropy based model e g maxent in most cases for example while auc from the model mml was less accurate than the model developed by kariminejad et al 2019 auc of 0 958 it showed a higher auc value than those of arabameri et al 2020a bernini et al 2021 pourghasemi et al 2017 and zabihi et al 2018 given that the mentioned studies used comparable predictors the improved accuracy in the present study is likely attributed to the accounting of seasonal variability i e lai and precipitation 3 5 analysis of the gully erosion susceptibility concerning environmental factors the response curves for the factors i e sensitivity with importance higher than 5 are indicated in fig 8 note that there are irregular abrupt peaks or troughs at specific factor values indicating overfitting or over parameterization one of the major concerns in machine learning models like maxent that can lead to predictive biases in the spatial distribution of environmental factors liu et al 2018 a strategy to mitigate this problem is model simplification aimed at reducing the number of environmental factors with a sufficient sample size merow et al 2013 however results from this study indicated that the factor distribution presented discontinuities even though a set of rules were applied for model reduction therefore it is recommended to focus on the overall trends indicated in the dashed lines in fig 8 when interpreting the sensitivity curves land use had a range of p from 0 12 to 0 50 where other hay has the highest probability of developing gully erosion and grassland has the lower probability all other land uses did not present prominent differences regarding organic matter and awc the model indicates that the risk of developing gully erosion is inversely proportional to their increase among other reasons this behavior was found most especially for organic matter and explained by the linkages of soil organic matter with the reduction of runoff generation and increased rainfall infiltration due to its protecting capacity of soil sealing and crusting roth et al 1985 in addition the increase in biological activity increases macroporosity and improves the soil s water holding capacity bot and benites 2005 on the other hand an opposite behavior directly proportional increase was found for slope and max p slope and max p are critical drivers in soil erosion favoring the development of concentrated flow and particle detachment and runoff generation respectively 3 6 development of the gully erosion susceptibility map the gully erosion susceptibility map was developed based on the probability calculated by the selected model mm l fig 9 the susceptibility was classified into four classes based on the natural breaks method where the boundary values between classes were rounded for convenience sake 1 low 0 p 0 15 2 moderate 0 15 p 0 30 3 high 0 30 p 0 50 and 4 elevated 0 50 p 1 0 a total of 75 3 of the agricultural areas fell in the moderate 29 4 and low 46 0 categories table 4 while 24 6 were found in the high 15 7 and elevated 8 9 categories an evaluation of the identified gully erosion locations i e 5621 indicated that 90 5 of these locations black and green dots in fig 9b fell in the high 14 9 and elevated 75 6 categories note that as the erosion location was flagged as true gully erosion it was expected that 100 of the observed gullies were found in the high and elevated categories however 9 5 of the gully locations i e 533 were classified as moderate and low risk an analysis of the susceptibility map indicates that 73 of the gully susceptible areas in the high and elevated categories are primarily located in corn and soybean fields fig 3 in addition fields near streams were identified with a higher vulnerability of gully development as the elevated category is mainly located adjacent to small streams fig 9b where approximately 50 of gully locations were found nearby 100 m from small streams e g green dots in fig 9b such patterns were found reasonable considering that erosion occurring near streams is driven by the occurrences of the high water table seepage and the development of concentrated flow in the proximity of water bodies furthermore gully head retreat streambank erosion driven by streamflow and seepage fluxes can exacerbate gully formation allen et al 2018 botero acosta et al 2017 zabihi et al 2018 an evaluation of the model performance for each land use indicates that approximately 82 of the total gully locations were well predicted across all categories fig 10 however the model poorly performed in other hay and grassland with a misprediction rate exceeding 30 marked as a red square in fig 10 given the limited area of these land use types within the study area this was explained by insufficient information on these subcategories i e poor quality or biased data a common limitation of a data driven model for example other hay land use accounts for only 1 8 of the total study area therefore it is likely that this category does not carry enough information for model training and validation compared to the corn and soybean categories which account for 39 and 47 of the total area respectively 4 conclusions predicting areas vulnerable to gully erosion is essential to establishing practical and efficient mitigation plans e g crop production infrastructure archaeology in this study twenty eight gully erosion controlling factors were extracted from readily available data lidar derived dem gssurgo and remote sensing data and were used to develop a predictive model aimed at identifying vulnerable areas for gully development among all factors considered the slope land use seasonal daily maximum precipitation and organic matter indicated the highest contribution in predicting the presence of gullies furthermore the spatio temporal changes in land cover and precipitation were crucial across all seasons when predicting gully formation in agricultural areas the proposed modeling framework was developed in jefferson county il and found that approximately 7 4 of the agricultural land in the study area is at an elevated risk of gully erosion this approach can be applied across the midwest u s region sharing similar land management and environmental variables despite the model s reliable result the locations of gully erosion regarded as the true presences datasets were extracted from the lidar derived dems without field verification due to the gap in time between lidar acquisition gully occurrences and research for this reason the gully erosion locations were expected to include a degree of uncertainty which may propagate to the model outputs even though extensive scrutiny using high resolution imageries was performed in addition the accuracy of land use data may add to the source of uncertainty given the discrepancy between the actual and lidar or remote sensing surveying conditions hence quantifying data quality and uncertainty through field verification could enhance the validity of this study this study proposed a cost effective and time efficient framework to develop a gully susceptibility mapping on large scales e g regional with readily available data various gully driving environmental factors were explored and associated with an area

7876,study region the study was tested in jefferson county in illinois usa whose land use is a typical representation of row crop cultivation in the midwestern usa study focus this study aimed to predict the gully erosion susceptibility in agricultural land using remote sensed environmental data topographic pedologic land cover precipitation and vegetation development considering their spatio temporal variability in a modeling framework based on the maximum entropy model maxent the methodology thoroughly evaluated each environmental factor contributing to gully erosion prediction and used a set of rules based on accuracy transferability and efficiency to evaluate the model performance new hydrological insights for the region this study developed a data driven modeling framework that can be applied across other regions the modeling framework indicates that fifteen factors were the most relevant for developing the gully erosion susceptibility map where 7 4 of the agricultural land in the study area was found at elevated risk of developing gully erosion slope land cover organic matter seasonal lai and maximum daily precipitation were the most contributing environmental factors

authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction soil erosion is the detachment mobilization and deposition of soil particles occurring asymmetrically across landscapes and streams by wind or water under the combination of complex processes in general soil erosion by water also known as water erosion can be classified into three processes following its development sheet rill and gully erosion among the three gully erosion has been regarded as the most severe phase frankl et al 2013 zegeye et al 2017 forming large channels that are challenging to manage with conventional agricultural machinery decreasing crop production cama et al 2020 as a result once gullies are developed their management is challenging lengthy and costly in this regard designing and implementing proactive measures to prevent gully formation became critical thereby predicting the probable locations of gully formation the first step in directing conservation strategies popp et al 2000 conoscenti et al 2014 a variety of studies on predicting gully erosion have been attempted through many physical based models including creams chemicals runoff and erosion from agricultural management systems egem ephemeral gully erosion mode mike she and wepp water erosion prediction project knisel 1980 flanagan and nearing 1995 refsgaard and knudsen 1996 woodward 1999 these models require extensive input data e g climate topography soil and time series of detailed farm operation information that are not commonly available in addition these models cannot integrate the necessary spatio temporal resolution of data and surface dynamics to simulate the entire process accurately on large scales nor evaluate gully erosion susceptibility due to the computational complexity and the insufficient understanding of gully formation pourghasemi et al 2017 vanmaercke et al 2021 due to these drawbacks of physical based models there is a need for computational tools to efficiently predict gully erosion across the local regional and global scales finding a good balance between accurate process representation feasible data requirements and computational capacity vanmaercke et al 2016 bauer et al 2021 as alternatives data driven or probabilistic statistical approaches based on machine learning models have become widely applied to estimate gully susceptibility angileri et al 2016 rahmati et al 2017 arabameri et al 2020a cama et al 2020 these approaches can solve problems with scarce data with lesser expertise to reproduce the aimed outputs amiri et al 2019 among many machine learning models the maximum entropy maxent model has been widely used to predict environmental issues including gully erosion leblanc et al 2005 davis and sims 2013 dube et al 2014 xu et al 2020 although it was initially developed to study habitat suitability by determining the probability of the presence of species phillips et al 2006 most of the previous research on gully susceptibility prediction mainly focused on steady state variables in time e g topographic and pedologic factors without accounting for the temporal variability of significant factors pertinent to gully erosion such as precipitation and surface cover bou kheir et al 2007 li and mccarty 2018 li et al 2018 zabihi et al 2018 although some studies applied temporal factors including precipitation and the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi botero acosta et al 2017 pourghasemi et al 2017 arabameri et al 2020b the values of temporal factors in their research were on an annual basis and this temporal scale is inappropriate to reflect the seasonal variability of drivers that can exacerbate or mitigate gully development gomez gutierrez et al 2009 in this regard the main objective of this study was to develop a framework to predict the geospatial location of gully erosion in agricultural lands accounting for the spatio temporal changes in environmental conditions specifically this study was geared to 1 develop a modeling framework that integrates environmental factors driving gully erosion at a high spatial and temporal resolution and 2 develop and evaluate maxent models to identify the environmental factors that are theoretical and computationally efficient to estimate gully susceptibility and 3 create a gully erosion susceptibility map and evaluate its linkage with the environmental features 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the modeling framework was developed tested and evaluated in jefferson county illinois usa located in the southern part of illinois covering 1512 km2 fig 1a rolling topography is found across the county with local relief of about 15 m upland prairies are flat to moderately hilly and shallow valleys leighton et al 1948 from east to the west three fourths of the county area lies in the big muddy river watershed draining towards the rend lake at jefferson and franklin counties leighton et al 1948 fitzjerrells and lueker 2009 the rend lake dam is used for flood control water supply recreation fish and wildlife as a stimulus for economic redevelopment nieto and donath 1976 siltation and water quality have been of great importance the climate in jefferson county is characterized by hot dry summers ranging from 15 c to 32 c and cold wet winters ranging from 6 4 c noaa 2020 precipitation follows a bimodal pattern with peaks in may and november and a total annual average precipitation of 1117 6 mm fig 1b the most rainfall happens during spring middle mar jun 30 while 20 occurs during the fall season middle sep dec the major land uses in jefferson county are agriculture 59 forest 27 urban 10 and water 4 based on the 2012 cropland data layer cdl product of the u s department of agriculture usda national agricultural statistics service nass boryan et al 2011 with agricultural areas dominated by row crop production corn and soybean the area of this study serves to characterize the agricultural activity in the corn belt region dominated by intense row crop production across corn soybean and wheat crops with similarities in soil genesis and land management practices 2 2 maximum entropy model maxent the maxent model is based on the maximum entropy theory with a machine learning approach applying a presence only algorithm modeling phenomenon when information about their absence is insufficient or unattainable merow et al 2013 maxent uses a set of presence data of a phenomenon e g gully erosion and a set of environmental factors to spatially predict an unknown probability distribution however maxent can suffer selection bias as sample collection is often spatially biased toward easily accessed areas to measure or observe a target variable here gully erosion phillips et al 2009 the approach proposed by this study is not affected by this issue as gully locations were detected using remotely sensed data which is not limited to location access in maxent a given space x is represented in discrete grids where x i represents the cell in the x domain where a targeting phenomenon e g gully erosion has been observed phillips et al 2004 the most contributing environmental variable was allocated to each cell x i in which the probability of occurrence p x called the relative occurrence rate ror was calculated using eq 1 1 pz x i e λ z x i i e λ z x i where z is a vector of the predictor at location x i and λ is a vector of regression coefficients the calculated rors are normalized values consequently their sum over the study area equals 1 the maxent model employs the receiver operating characteristic roc curves and the auc area under the roc curve to evaluate model performance a roc analysis shows how sensitivity true positive rate changes against specificity 1 false positive rate over a series of thresholds which can be summarized by an auc muschelli 2019 an auc ranging from 0 5 to 0 6 is considered poor while values closer to 1 are considered a more reliable metric performance when predicting the probability of the phenomenon s presence here gully erosion rahmati et al 2017 more details on the mathematical process can be found in phillips et al 2004 and phillips and dudík 2008a 2 3 methodology the study was divided into four main parts fig 2 first a gully erosion inventory map was created by subtracting two light detection and ranging lidar derived digital elevation models dems the differences in elevation were then filtered for noise and those exceeding a given threshold were used as the presence of gully erosion in the maxent model second the environmental factors controlling gullies were identified based on literature and re constructed using the different data sources the importance of all factors was then investigated by performing the permutation test and the major driving factors within each factor group topography pedology land cover and precipitation were selected objective 1 third a series of the maxent models were developed with different combinations of the selected major factors among which the best environmental factors were determined objective 2 lastly using the model with the best factor set a gully erosion susceptibility map was developed and the geospatial attributes of susceptible areas were explored objective 3 the details about each process are described in the following sections 2 3 1 gully erosion inventory mapping the gully erosion inventory in agricultural lands based on the crop data layer cdl in 2012 was mapped using two lidar derived dems at a 2 m 2012 and 1 m 2015 resolution assuming that agricultural areas and cultivated crops in 2012 were maintained until 2015 the two dems corrected to eliminate human made structures or vegetations were obtained from the illinois state geological survey isgs https clearinghouse isgs illinois edu the identification of gully erosion was derived from the difference in elevations between the two dems martínez casasnovas et al 2002 evans and lindsay 2010 using a 2 m grid resolution the paved road e bonnie rd elevation in rend lake red dot in fig 1a was used as a reference for the dem calibration assuming no elevation change happened on this road between 2012 and 2015 ten points were randomly chosen and the average difference in elevation between two dems was regarded as a noise caused by the inherent discrepancies between the two lidar datasets the average elevation difference of the ten points was 6 2 cm and was subtracted from the difference between the two dems a threshold value of 50 cm was applied to consider the presence of gully erosion only laflen et al 1986 laflen and shaw 1988 because the processed dem map may also contain sheet and rill erosion the 50 cm depth was estimated based on deep tillage depth e g 33 cm raper et al 2000 and the vertical accuracy of lidar dems approximately 20 cm at a 95 confidence level authority 1998 as lidar s accuracy can be affected by shadows affecting the wavelength intensity of the returned signal from the surface to a sensor a thorough examination was conducted using aerial imageries of 2012 and 2015 acquired from the national agriculture imagery program naip by usda this analysis aimed to remove locations with human activities that result in significant changes in elevation and cloud perturbation e g shadows in the lidar datasets guislain et al 2016 yüksel and boyaci 2018 the final estimated location of gully erosion was transformed into a point dataset to be used as the presence of gully erosion for the maxent model and assumed to represent the probable location of gullies regardless of their size type or stage of development i e both ephemeral and classical or permanent gullies for cross validation 70 of the gully sample points were randomly selected as a training dataset and 30 were used for model validation 2 3 2 construction of environmental factors to consider the spatial temporal effects of the environmental features on gully erosion topographic and pedologic factors were considered stationary factors while land cover and precipitation were used as time varying factors in daily seasonal and annual time series table 1 a set of nine topographic factors and a set of twelve pedologic factors were selected based on literature valentin et al 2005 bou kheir et al 2007 tuo et al 2015 biddoccu et al 2017 botero acosta et al 2017 lenhart et al 2017 li and mccarty 2018 li et al 2018 kariminejad et al 2019 cama et al 2020 topographic factors were extracted from the lidar derived dem of 2012 the pedology factors were extracted from the gridded soil survey geographic gssurgo database nrcs 2021 the gssurgo database a gridded form of the standard usda nrcs soil survey geographic ssurgo database contains the tabular data of various soil properties and derivatives to a state wide extent more details about this dataset can be found in nrcs 2021 the pedologic factors were mapped using the soil data development toolbox using the mukey gssurgo database attribute that links soil attributes to their geolocation note that in this study the representative soil depth for soil mapping was set to the upper 50 cm to consider the impacts of conventional tillage depth etana et al 1999 raper et al 2000 land use and leaf area index lai were selected as land cover factors the annual and seasonal lai were considered to represent the spatio temporal dynamics of the plant canopy lai maps were produced using the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis lai product mcd15a2h from 2012 to 2015 an eight day composite lai data with a spatial resolution of 500 m myneni et al 2015 precipitation factors were mapped using the national centers for environmental prediction ncep stage iv daily precipitation datasets assimilating radar and gauge observations at a 1 km spatial resolution the following factors were computed from 2012 to 2015 to account for the temporal variability of precipitation 1 seasonal average daily precipitation ave p 2 seasonal maximum daily precipitation max p 3 seasonal total precipitation tot p and 4 annual precipitation ann p seasons were defined based on the climate regime and cultural practices as spring march to may summer june to august fall september to november and winter december to february the annual and seasonal factors within the land cover and precipitation factors were compared to identify the temporal effects on gully erosion prediction 2 3 3 relative importance analysis of environmental factors the relative importance of each factor within each factor group was analyzed through a permutation test the permutation test measures the decrease in the accuracy of the final training result caused by the variable s permutation which is normalized as an index for contribution analysis phillips and dudík 2008b regardless of the number of factors within factor groups a threshold value of 0 05 was used to select the significant factors the selection of a threshold value of 0 05 provides a satisfactory feature selection accuracy prasetiyowati et al 2021 in addition the effects of the seasonal variance i e temporal variability in land cover and precipitation factors on gully erosion prediction were investigated based on the analysis of environmental factors the major contributing factors were selected for each factor group 2 3 4 development and evaluation of the gully erosion susceptibility map the multivariate model evaluation was built from baseline variables i e land use slope max p and organic matter incremented by one variable per model and then performed a model evaluation computed the relative degree of importance and the model prediction accuracy the best model was selected based on the following set of rules 1 minimum number of applied variables i e efficiency 2 maximum model performance i e accuracy and 3 minimum auc difference between the training and test i e transferability following the best model selection the probability of gully presence for agricultural lands was estimated and mapped in a 2 2 m spatial resolution and then classified into four susceptibility classes using the natural breaks jenks method the natural breaks method groups data to reduce the variance within classes and maximize the variance between classes jenks 1967 chalkias et al 2014 demonstrated that the natural breaks method is more efficient in susceptibility mapping than other classification methods e g equal interval and standard deviation classifications and it has been the most used in susceptibility assessment chalkias et al 2014 chen et al 2015 sema et al 2017 hong et al 2018 as a final step each factor was evaluated through response curves to assess the change in the estimated probability of gully presence as a function of a change in each factor sensitivity while other factors remain fixed at their average values 3 results and discussions 3 1 gully erosion location in the study area a total of 5621 gully erosion locations in agricultural fields were identified over the study area fig 3a these gully locations were assumed as true gully presences and used as the maxent model s input a visual evaluation of gully locations was conducted using the 2012 and 2015 aerial images to confirm their validity fig 3b e generally gully locations were more pronounced in the southern part of jefferson county near the rend lake reservoir where row crop fields i e corn and soybean are more prevalent than in the northern part table 2 3 2 importance analysis of pedologic and topographic factors the results of the importance analysis of pedologic factors showed that k factor silt content organic matter and awc had a contribution greater than 10 and the k factor had the highest contribution 19 1 to gully prediction fig 4a among twelve factors seven factors with a contribution greater than 5 k factor silt content organic matter awc hsg clay content and t factor were selected in the case of the topography factors the slope acquired the highest contribution 47 2 to gully prediction followed by twi aspect standard curvature and profile curvature fig 4b such high contributions of these factors were found in agreement with previous studies that the slope curvature aspect and twi are reported to show a high association with gully development li and mccarty 2018 li et al 2018 cama et al 2020 the five topographic factors showing a contribution higher than 5 were selected as the primary factors 3 3 temporal effects of the environmental factors on gully prediction the contribution of the seasonal factors was compared with the non seasonal factors e g land use annual lai and annual precipitation in the importance analysis for land cover factors fig 4c the contribution of land use was higher than the annual lai and seasonal lai accounting for approximately 70 of the total contribution such significance of the land use factor was reasonable since gully erosion fig 3 was mainly found in areas with row crop production of corn soybean and winter wheat table 2 furthermore the higher importance of land cover than lai follows existing models accounting for land use and land cover rather than relative vegetation indices such as ndvi and lai this might be because different crops require different cultivation practices e g tillage planting irrigation and some of this information is embedded in land cover data vanmaercke et al 2021 the comparison of the seasonal lai with the annual lai showed that the former s contribution 24 3 was approximately five times greater than the latter s 4 6 fig 4c this difference is because the seasonal lai better represents the spatial heterogeneity of lai distribution than the annual lai the lai in spring and fall in particular had a more heterogeneous distribution than annual lai while lai in summer and winter presented relatively monotonic distributions fig 5 given the dominant contribution of the land use and its correlation with the lai cohen et al 2003 the seasonal lai s high contribution implied that it encoded additional information on the spatial heterogeneity caused by vegetation which the land use dataset does not provide the importance of lai was due in part to farming operations e g tillage planting and harvesting during spring march and april and fall september and october crop growth especially at the early stage varies depending on the conditions of the surrounding environment including soil moisture temperature solar radiation and seed formulation sacks et al 2010 and this led to the most noticeable spatial heterogeneity and the highest contribution 15 7 of the lai in spring fig 5a in contrast summer and winter presented less spatial variation the reason is that row crops in most cases can reach maturity before the end of summer covering the surface until harvest moreover most agricultural fields are bare during winter except for areas planted with cover crops fig 5b d thus seasonal lai reasonably characterized such temporal and spatial changes in the land surface due to agricultural activities all distributions of seasonal precipitation showed spatial and temporal differences fig 6 for example max p during spring and summer was likely to be more intense in the southeast part of the study area but relatively milder in fall and winter such spatio temporal changes in precipitation patterns may lead to a higher contribution of seasonal precipitation factors than annual precipitation fig 4d the max p had the highest contribution among the seasonal factors as precipitation intensity is critical among the various rainfall characteristic descriptors e g duration total depth and frequency such a significant effect of rainfall intensity on gully development has been demonstrated by numerous studies vanmaercke et al 2021 rainfall intensity exacerbates particle detachment and mobilization due to increased raindrop energy and the likelihood of developing concentrated flow vanmaercke et al 2016 in summary land use and seasonal lai in the land cover group and seasonal max p and seasonal tot p in the precipitation group were selected as major contributing factors in predicting the probability of gully erosion 3 4 environmental factors model development and model performance evaluation among all factors with a more significant contribution than 5 land use showed the highest contribution with 20 1 followed by slope max p fall and winter organic matter and awc fig 7 it is noted that each of these factors belongs to a different environmental group implying that each environmental group carries unique information linked to gully erosion development another noteworthy finding is that different factor combinations can change the importance of factors for example the k factor had the lowest importance among the selected pedologic factors however it presented the highest importance when only pedologic factors were compared fig 4a this was explained as a result of collinearity or multicollinearity a situation where two or more predictors are highly associated this factor dependency suggests that even a factor relevant to a one factor group e g topography can provide information to some degree to other factor groups e g soil however it is challenging to reveal the underlying mechanisms and interactions that resulted in the change in the factor importance due to the black box nature of machine learning a well known constraint of machine learning techniques vanmaercke et al 2021 table 3 summarizes the model evaluation and the criteria for model selection it was considered that the higher the number of factors the lower the model efficiency the higher the auc for training and testing the higher the model accuracy and the smaller the auc difference the higher the transferability in general factor incremental led to increased auc for training and test and thereby the training auc reached a plateau value of 0 828 at model mm q beyond the model mm h no significant improvement in accuracy was observed among the models the mma model indicated the highest transferability with an auc difference of 0 004 given the model selection criteria the model mm l was selected as the best factor combination although a direct comparison of the current study with the existing studies is challenging due to the differences in splitting strategies for training test set partitioning spatial resolution and environmental conditions the auc metric can be used for comparison the developed model mml shows better performance than other models developed in previous studies for gully susceptibility using an entropy based model e g maxent in most cases for example while auc from the model mml was less accurate than the model developed by kariminejad et al 2019 auc of 0 958 it showed a higher auc value than those of arabameri et al 2020a bernini et al 2021 pourghasemi et al 2017 and zabihi et al 2018 given that the mentioned studies used comparable predictors the improved accuracy in the present study is likely attributed to the accounting of seasonal variability i e lai and precipitation 3 5 analysis of the gully erosion susceptibility concerning environmental factors the response curves for the factors i e sensitivity with importance higher than 5 are indicated in fig 8 note that there are irregular abrupt peaks or troughs at specific factor values indicating overfitting or over parameterization one of the major concerns in machine learning models like maxent that can lead to predictive biases in the spatial distribution of environmental factors liu et al 2018 a strategy to mitigate this problem is model simplification aimed at reducing the number of environmental factors with a sufficient sample size merow et al 2013 however results from this study indicated that the factor distribution presented discontinuities even though a set of rules were applied for model reduction therefore it is recommended to focus on the overall trends indicated in the dashed lines in fig 8 when interpreting the sensitivity curves land use had a range of p from 0 12 to 0 50 where other hay has the highest probability of developing gully erosion and grassland has the lower probability all other land uses did not present prominent differences regarding organic matter and awc the model indicates that the risk of developing gully erosion is inversely proportional to their increase among other reasons this behavior was found most especially for organic matter and explained by the linkages of soil organic matter with the reduction of runoff generation and increased rainfall infiltration due to its protecting capacity of soil sealing and crusting roth et al 1985 in addition the increase in biological activity increases macroporosity and improves the soil s water holding capacity bot and benites 2005 on the other hand an opposite behavior directly proportional increase was found for slope and max p slope and max p are critical drivers in soil erosion favoring the development of concentrated flow and particle detachment and runoff generation respectively 3 6 development of the gully erosion susceptibility map the gully erosion susceptibility map was developed based on the probability calculated by the selected model mm l fig 9 the susceptibility was classified into four classes based on the natural breaks method where the boundary values between classes were rounded for convenience sake 1 low 0 p 0 15 2 moderate 0 15 p 0 30 3 high 0 30 p 0 50 and 4 elevated 0 50 p 1 0 a total of 75 3 of the agricultural areas fell in the moderate 29 4 and low 46 0 categories table 4 while 24 6 were found in the high 15 7 and elevated 8 9 categories an evaluation of the identified gully erosion locations i e 5621 indicated that 90 5 of these locations black and green dots in fig 9b fell in the high 14 9 and elevated 75 6 categories note that as the erosion location was flagged as true gully erosion it was expected that 100 of the observed gullies were found in the high and elevated categories however 9 5 of the gully locations i e 533 were classified as moderate and low risk an analysis of the susceptibility map indicates that 73 of the gully susceptible areas in the high and elevated categories are primarily located in corn and soybean fields fig 3 in addition fields near streams were identified with a higher vulnerability of gully development as the elevated category is mainly located adjacent to small streams fig 9b where approximately 50 of gully locations were found nearby 100 m from small streams e g green dots in fig 9b such patterns were found reasonable considering that erosion occurring near streams is driven by the occurrences of the high water table seepage and the development of concentrated flow in the proximity of water bodies furthermore gully head retreat streambank erosion driven by streamflow and seepage fluxes can exacerbate gully formation allen et al 2018 botero acosta et al 2017 zabihi et al 2018 an evaluation of the model performance for each land use indicates that approximately 82 of the total gully locations were well predicted across all categories fig 10 however the model poorly performed in other hay and grassland with a misprediction rate exceeding 30 marked as a red square in fig 10 given the limited area of these land use types within the study area this was explained by insufficient information on these subcategories i e poor quality or biased data a common limitation of a data driven model for example other hay land use accounts for only 1 8 of the total study area therefore it is likely that this category does not carry enough information for model training and validation compared to the corn and soybean categories which account for 39 and 47 of the total area respectively 4 conclusions predicting areas vulnerable to gully erosion is essential to establishing practical and efficient mitigation plans e g crop production infrastructure archaeology in this study twenty eight gully erosion controlling factors were extracted from readily available data lidar derived dem gssurgo and remote sensing data and were used to develop a predictive model aimed at identifying vulnerable areas for gully development among all factors considered the slope land use seasonal daily maximum precipitation and organic matter indicated the highest contribution in predicting the presence of gullies furthermore the spatio temporal changes in land cover and precipitation were crucial across all seasons when predicting gully formation in agricultural areas the proposed modeling framework was developed in jefferson county il and found that approximately 7 4 of the agricultural land in the study area is at an elevated risk of gully erosion this approach can be applied across the midwest u s region sharing similar land management and environmental variables despite the model s reliable result the locations of gully erosion regarded as the true presences datasets were extracted from the lidar derived dems without field verification due to the gap in time between lidar acquisition gully occurrences and research for this reason the gully erosion locations were expected to include a degree of uncertainty which may propagate to the model outputs even though extensive scrutiny using high resolution imageries was performed in addition the accuracy of land use data may add to the source of uncertainty given the discrepancy between the actual and lidar or remote sensing surveying conditions hence quantifying data quality and uncertainty through field verification could enhance the validity of this study this study proposed a cost effective and time efficient framework to develop a gully susceptibility mapping on large scales e g regional with readily available data various gully driving environmental factors were explored and associated with an area susceptible to gully erosion the proposed framework will help policymakers and land managers focus their prevention or mitigation efforts directing resources where they are most needed credit

total area of 6700 km2 it is so nicknamed the water tower of central africa study focus because of the failure of the water supply system in the region households the local population and regional authorities are exploiting groundwater resources unfortunately an important number of wells and boreholes are reported to be unproductive because of the nonexistence of preliminary hydrogeophysical

scarce commodity for a large proportion of people especially in developing countries gonzales et al 2019 xu et al 2019 the region of central africa namely cameroon congo nigeria and the central african republic located just above the equator with one of the most important pluviometry in the world is curiously experiencing water stress only the main cities are covered by the national public water authority network and expect a three time per week supply with doubtful quality water elsewhere the water distribution system is outdated or inexistent as a result there is a blooming attempt at groundwater exploitation throughout the region with a low rate of success because of the absence of prior hydrogeophysical investigation or surveys conducted in areas with low groundwater potential gwp the adamawa region is chosen herein as a case study for two essential reasons it previously gave room to a set of hydrogeophysical and hydrogeological investigations where hydro parameters were interpreted separately in addition this region plays the function of the watershed in an international hydrogeological system that drains cameroon congo the federal republic of nigeria and the central african republic and hosts transboundary aquifers the bedrock is faulted presuming an important groundwater potential in the region aretouyap et al 2015 2017 and bisso et al 2019 used different geoelectrical techniques to explore this groundwater potential but in their approaches each contributing hydrogeophysical parameter was interpreted separately the global groundwater quality of the region was assessed from the thirty four existing boreholes and said to be good with a groundwater quality index equal to 82 11 aretouyap et al 2014a this value makes the local groundwater of acceptable quality but that investigation didn t address the aquifer productivity the potential impact of climate variability on regional water resources was investigated and depicted that rivers springs and wells are being dried up due to climate change aretouyap et al 2014b geoelectrical parameters such as hydraulic conductivity and transmissivity were already determined from the available pumping tests where an empirical relationship between aquifer thickness resistivity and experimental hydraulic conductivity allowed to compute the hydraulic conductivity values for the remaining thirty six vertical electrical sounding ves points and interpolate them for the whole study area aretouyap et al 2015 the porosity values were assessed to range between 0 19 and 0 43 aretouyap et al 2017 by proposing the ves as an alternative technique to the pumping test aretouyap et al 2018 obtained hydraulic conductivity values ranging from 0 4 to 6 0 m day more importantly a meticulous analysis of transmissivity values disclosed the presence of two aquifer tendencies in the region this hydrogeophysical investigation carried out by aretouyap et al 2018 was deepened by establishing two more relationships between aquifer parameters the first one between the transverse resistance and the modified transverse resistance and the second one between the transmissivity and the modified transverse resistance this enabled computation and interpolation of the transmissivity values to range from 4 to 17 4 m² day for the whole region aretouyap et al 2019a although a complementary approach namely the inverse slope method ism was utilized to verify and confirm the results obtained previously using the curve matching method cmm when interpreting ves data aretouyap et al 2020 there was a shortcoming in the whole methodological conception indeed preceding investigations considered the study area as a single uniform geological unit consequently to fix this issue new sequential relationships based on the geological settings were established between electrical data and hydrogeological parameters aretouyap et al 2021 as a result transverse resistance thickness resistivity transmissivity and hydraulic conductivity are modified and updated particularly in their mean values to be as follows from 8 59 to 777 6 ω2 m from 31 to 4 9 m from 225 to 30 8 ω m from 31 15 to 31 m2 day and from 2 74 to 0 3 m day respectively however all those studies and other similar ones that are not abovementioned aretouyap et al 2019b bisso et al 2019 attempted to assess the aquifer productivity of the adamawa region by analyzing the conducive factors individually the present work is therefore an experimental new approach to elaborating the groundwater potential gwp by

are aquifer depth resistivity thickness transverse resistivity transmissivity and hydraulic conductivity the present investigation mainly aims at using the fuzzy algebraic model in a gis environment

respect to their specific weights in the final output 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the adamawa region is located between longitudes 11 16 e and latitudes 6 8 n in the heart of central africa fig 1 and plays an important hydrogeological role at an international level with its 150 300 km wide the adamawa plateau stands as the major watershed for cameroon and its neighboring countries namely congo the federal republic of nigeria and the central african republic aretouyap et al 2021 it extends from the federal republic of nigeria to the central african republic with a total area of 6700 km2 volcanic highlands constitute the main morphological feature of the region with an average altitude of 1100 m this is the result of tectonic subsidence and uplift tchameni et al 2001 the terrain is very rugged characterized by a huge cliff in the north and an uneven escapement southward the center of the region is characterized by swampy valleys and a gentle topography scattered with volcanic cones and mountains one can observe large massifs resulting from tectonic and erosional events in the eastern part and high hills and mountains westward a set of basins and plains are also observed in the study region with a plateau sloping gradually from north to south toteu et al 2000 the pan african granite gneiss constitutes the local bedrock with migmatites ordovician granites and gneisses as the major rocks this is the result of three successive geologic events a long period of continental erosion from precambrian to cretaceous an onset of volcanism from cretaceous to quaternary and recurrent basement tectonics aretouyap et al 2021 basalts metadiorites trachytes and trachyphonolites are the main geological units of the region toteu et al 2000 2001 there are two main directions of faults the volcanic line of cameroon oriented n 30 e and the adamawa shear zone oriented n 70 e njonfang et al 2008 at the hydrogeological level the upper weathered and the fractured portion of the bedrock is the most interesting a set of investigations e g chilton and foster 1995 dewandel et al 2006 bianchi et al 2020 established the weathered profile of crystalline basement rocks in tropical africa in our study area this profile is sorted from the top to the bottom as follows topsoil of a few meters made up of laterite and ferritic soils two components upper and lower of saprolite commonly called saprocks made up of clay minerals and fractured layer bianchi 2020 topsoil and saprocks are referred to as regolith the physical and chemical weathering of the crystalline bedrock controls the lithomineralogical structure and composition of each layer fookes 1997 in general the topsoil has high hydraulic conductivity on contrary an important fraction of the upper portion of saprocks has low values of hydraulic conductivity due to clay minerals but with maximum values of porosity chilton and foster 1995 k values of the upper saprolite are so low that this layer cannot sustain groundwater abstractions but does provide an important storage capacity because of its consistent porosity chilton n foster 1995 the most interesting aquifer generally targeted is the fractured and weathered portion of crystalline bedrock made up of saprocks aretouyap et al 2018 2019a fracturing and degree of weathering in this layer decreases with depth causing reduction of k values until they become representative of the matrix of fresh rock bianchi et al 2020 2 2 ves technology fifty ves points were carried out in the study area the schlumberger array was adapted and applied to measure the apparent resistivity data using ves with a half maximum current electrode spacing ab 2 of 1000 m and potential electrode spacing mn 2 of 25 m the resistance r a was first recorded in the field and converted later to apparent resistivity ρ a for the schlumberger configuration using eq 1 1 ρ a ab 2 2 mn 2 2 mn r a 2 this equation can be written as ρ a gr a where g is the geometrical factor eq 3 3 g ab 2 2 mn 2 2 mn the field apparent resistivity curves were obtained by increasing the electrode spacing ab 2 around a fixed point those vertical electrical sounding curves were thereafter plotted in the next stage for each of the survey locations and smoothened to remove noisy signatures chakravarthi et al 2007 ebong et al 2014 we used the curve matching technique with master curves to interpret the field resistivity curves and to determine an initial model including resistivities and thicknesses of the corresponding layers initial approximate model orellana and mooney 1966 the inversion winresist software program is thereafter used to interpret the parameters of the approximate model to get the final optimum model in which goodness of fit between the field resistivity curve and the final theoretical regenerated curve was realized zohdy 1989 zohdy and bisdorf 1989 this inversion procedure allows estimating the values of the true resistivity depth and thickness of the subsurface after several iterations for each ves point fig 2 shows examples of interpreting ves point p08 and comparison with the lithological description of those points the obtained real thicknesses and resistivities of the corresponding layers of the analyzed ves points in the study area are used to establish the hydraulic parameters of the studied aquifer as shown in table 1 those interpretative parameters are used thereafter for interpolating the criteria layers of depth resistivity thickness transverse resistivity transmissivity and hydraulic conductivity by using inverse distance weighted idw method 2 3 fuzzy algebraic sum model fuzzy set theory and fuzzy logic which were first developed by zadeh 1965 have been widely applied to the modeling of ambiguity and uncertainty in decision making fuzzy logic s fundamental idea is relatively straightforward statements indicate each input s degree of truth or falseness in addition to being either true or false the fundamental element of the idea is that fuzzy sets are defined by their membership functions 2 3 1 factor standardization by applying a fuzzy membership function the crisp input boundaries were transformed into a degree of membership with a value between 0 representing no membership zone and 1 denoting the entire membership zone zhang et al 2015 this process is known as fuzzification in other meaning fuzzification of the input variables application of the fuzzy operator in the antecedent degree of fulfillment the implication from the antecedent to the consequent inference aggregation of the consequents across the rules and defuzzification are the typical steps in a fuzzy rule based model the goal of the fuzzy membership function is to combine the criterion layers into a single scale all classes in this inquiry were standardized using the fuzzy liner membership technique the fuzzy membership method works well when you want the fuzzy membership to be within a certain range and any negative or positive divergence from that range decreases the desirability the fuzzy linear eq 4 is as follows according to benz et al 2004 4 µ x 0 if x min 1 if x max x min max min otherwise 2 3 2 fuzzy overlay we must overlay the criteria after scaling each criterion and utilizing fuzzy membership methods to translate values between the 0 and 1 interval criteria can be overlaid using fuzzy operators the choice of an operator depends on how the variables interact or how the operator s final impact incremental or decreasing is on the criteria all of the fuzzified raster inputs were combined using the fuzzy overlay technique lee 2007 the literature raines et al 2010 baidya et al 2014 lewis et al 2014 mallik et al 2021 raad et al 2022 lists five different fuzzy combination operators fuzzy or fuzzy and fuzzy product fuzzy sum and fuzzy gamma 2 3 2 1 fuzzy and this operator completely disregards the high weights of the pixels and only takes into account the minimal degree of membership of the pixels to create the final map producing an extremely conservative outcome 2 3 2 2 fuzzy or the degree of membership in the final map is entered using this operator as the maximum pixel membership value across all combined maps as a result of ignoring low pixel weights an extremely optimistic output is produced 2 3 2 3 fuzzy product the degree of membership of a pixel in various maps is multiplied by the fuzzy product the final membership is reduced by this operator each pixel typically has very little weight assigned to it and if there are several input maps this weight tends to be zero 2 3 2 4 fuzzy sum the ultimate membership value of the pixels in the final map will tend to be 1 if there are numerous input maps this operator is appropriate for modeling and is employed when parameters reinforce one another 2 3 2 5 fuzzy gamma operator the product and sum operators are combined to create the gamma fuzzy operator by choosing the appropriate gamma value growing and decreasing criteria can be combined concurrently and the product and sum operators increasing and decreasing inclinations will be combined according to baidya et al 2014 and raad et al 2022 the generic function eq 5 is as follows 5 μ combinaison i 1 n μ i for fuzzy algebraic product i n μ i 1 for fuzzy algebraic product fuzzy algebraic sum λ fuzzy algebraic product 1 λ for fuzzy gamma in this equation μi is the fuzzy membership function for the ith map maps i 1 2 n are to be combined λ is a constant chosen in the range 0 1 a judicious choice of λ may control eventual abrupt variation of output values derived from sum and product operators the criteria have been overlaid in this study using the fuzzy sum operator because we believe that the parameters reinforce one another admittedly each parameter has a significant contribution to groundwater occurrence or yield but their combination gives a clear overview of the groundwater potential in the region and leads to an important decision making tool which is the gwp map hence the fuzzy sum stands as the most appropriate operator in addition this operator does not bias the final result in the case of repetition or redundancy of a parameter the suitability analysis was created using gis technologies and was based on multiple criterion layers in arcgis 10 8 all criterion layers were combined to provide a map with a fuzzy overlay showing the ideal spot for drilling new groundwater wells fig 3 depicts the appropriateness model s flowchart the fuzzy overlay tool can be used in a multi criteria superposition analysis to analyze the likelihood that a phenomenon falling under many categories will occur 3 results and discussion key findings are presented and discussed in this section hydrogeophysical data used in this analysis are presented in table 1 3 1 interpolation of the criteria layers the criterion layers were used to evaluate the gis and hydro geoelectric factor combination s results using the gis method of aggregating intersections i e the values of depth resistivity thickness transverse resistivity transmissivity and hydraulic conductivity as indicated in fig 3 the idw interpolation method was applied to interpolate layers of hydro geoelectric parameters fig 4 depth values range from 6 to 80 m resistivity values range between 3 and 90 ω m the thickness ranges from 1 4 to 18 m transverse resistivity values ranging between 8 5 and 777 6 ω m2 transmissivity values range from 8 4 to 40 m2 day and hydraulic conductivity values vary from 0 0002 to 1 5 m day 3 2 site suitability model the initial step in developing a site relevance model was to harmonize all levels of the criterion the linear fuzzy membership flm method is used for this stage the fuzzy linear membership of the six criterion layers employed in this investigation is shown in fig 5 finally using a fuzzy sum operator these factors are integrated to create a suitability map as illustrated in fig 6 the research region was divided into four groups by the findings map excluded low suitability moderate suitability and high suitability table 2 displays the total area as well as the proportion of each category that has been determined and explained areas with high suitability are mainly located in the northern southern eastern and central parts of the region they cover an area of 35187 km2 for 54 76 of the study area areas with moderate suitability are found in the west south east and a tiny part of the north they occupy an area of 20353 km2 and represent a percentage of 31 68 areas with low suitability are located in the west south and a small part of the east and north they cover an area of 7866 km2 and represent a proportion of 12 24 unsuitable areas with almost inexistent groundwater potential are located in the west and north they occupy an area of 848 km2 for a proportion of 1 32 firstly each parameter was mapped individually and then processed in a gis environment using the fuzzy algebraic model to map gwp from which is derived the suitability map higher is gwp on a site the more the site is suitable to bear a borehole or a well a visual similarity of the parameters distribution reveals some correlations between the suitability map and hydro parameters distribution areas with the lowest aquifer depth are included in the zone with the highest suitability raad et al 2022 with the resistivity where a higher resistivity areas match with the lower suitability zone a more suitable zone covers most of the areas with low transverse resistance values areas with lower transmissivity perfectly fit with the less suitable zone this observation is also true for the hydraulic conductivity where the lowest values are found in the zone excluded according to its very low suitability the strong correlation between the above mentioned parameters generally determined by geophysical or hydrogeological methods and the suitability distribution confirms the significance of the hydrogeophysical approach in groundwater exploration in the region gupta 1997 jones 2000 anomohanran 2013 nshagali et al 2014 aretouyap et al 2018 aretouyap et al 2019b bisso et al 2019 however there is no clear relationship between aquifer thickness variability and sustainability distribution in the adamawa region and the whole of central africa there is growing interest in the exploitation of groundwater resources by households schools health centers etc the lack of appropriate geophysical investigations generally leads to unproductive wells and boreholes even when a geophysical survey is envisaged the extent of the area to be investigated is so high that an important financial resource is required the outcome of this study addresses both issues by demarcating the most suitable zone where to focus the geophysical survey or to directly drill boreholes or wells in case of the absence of geophysics material or professional with a clear demarcation of the gwp zones in the adamawa plateau the fuzzy algebraic model is a very useful tool for groundwater exploration its appropriate application may considerably reduce the time and costs of groundwater exploration while increasing the rate of successful and productive wells and boreholes it can be successfully applied to any other region worldwide however its accuracy depends on a prior hydrogeophysical survey that may determine parameters to be processed in a gis environment 4 conclusions while groundwater is becoming the main source of water in most towns and villages in central africa the number of unproductive wells continues to grow previous attempts to improve the wells and boreholes yield in the adamawa region felt because related investigations addressed various hydro parameters individually and separately fifty ves points were interpreted in this article using the schlumberger configuration contributing parameters aquifer depth resistivity thickness transverse resistivity transmissivity and hydraulic conductivity to gwp derived from this interpretation are combined using the fuzzy algebraic model on a gis environment to demarcate gwp zones according to the gwp category the study area is classified into four suitability levels high moderate low and null covering 54 76 35187 km2 31 66 20353 km2 12 24 7866 km2 and 1 32 848 km2 of the total study area respectively this approach provides key information on the suitability of a site to bear a productive borehole for lasting and sustainable exploitation the fuzzy algebraic model demonstrates its ability to demarcate suitable zone to implement productive wells and boreholes in the adamawa region this article is a strategic document to support planners stakeholders decision makers and municipal authorities in their msd however the approach used cannot stand alone without prior classical geophysical and hydrological surveys for determining hydro parameters to be processed ideally a minimum of six independent parameters are needed for a reliable assessment although the approach is reported to be effective swift universal and advised for the analytical hierarchy process it is strongly recommended to densify investigation

controls the lithomineralogical structure and composition of each layer fookes 1997 in general the topsoil has high hydraulic conductivity on contrary an important fraction of the upper portion of saprocks has low values of hydraulic conductivity due to clay minerals but with maximum values of porosity chilton and foster 1995 k values of the upper saprolite are so low that this layer cannot sustain groundwater abstractions but does provide an important storage capacity because of its consistent porosity chilton n foster 1995 the most interesting aquifer generally targeted is the fractured and weathered portion of crystalline bedrock made up of saprocks aretouyap et al 2018 2019a fracturing and degree of weathering in this layer decreases with depth causing reduction of k values until they become representative of the matrix of fresh rock bianchi et al 2020 2 2 ves technology fifty ves points were carried out in the study area the schlumberger array was adapted and applied to measure the apparent resistivity data using ves with a half maximum current electrode spacing ab 2 of 1000 m and potential electrode spacing mn 2 of 25 m the resistance r a was first recorded in the field and converted later to apparent resistivity ρ a for the schlumberger configuration using eq 1 1 ρ a ab 2 2 mn 2 2 mn r a 2 this equation can be written as ρ a gr a where g is the geometrical factor eq 3 3 g ab 2 2 mn 2 2 mn the field apparent resistivity curves were obtained by increasing the electrode spacing ab 2 around a fixed point those vertical electrical sounding curves were thereafter plotted in the next stage for each of the survey locations and smoothened to remove noisy signatures chakravarthi et al 2007 ebong et al 2014 we used the curve matching technique with master curves to interpret the field resistivity curves and to determine an initial model including resistivities and thicknesses of the corresponding layers initial approximate model orellana and mooney 1966 the inversion winresist software program is thereafter used to interpret the parameters of the approximate model to get the final optimum model in which goodness of fit between the field resistivity curve and the final theoretical regenerated curve was realized zohdy 1989 zohdy and bisdorf 1989 this inversion procedure allows estimating the values of the true resistivity depth and thickness of the subsurface after several iterations for each ves point fig 2 shows examples of interpreting ves point p08 and comparison with the lithological description of those points the obtained real thicknesses and resistivities of the corresponding layers of the analyzed ves points in the study area are used to establish the hydraulic parameters of the studied aquifer as shown in table 1 those interpretative parameters are used thereafter for interpolating the criteria layers of depth resistivity thickness transverse resistivity transmissivity and hydraulic conductivity by using inverse distance weighted idw method 2 3 fuzzy algebraic sum model fuzzy set theory and fuzzy logic which were first developed by zadeh 1965 have been widely applied to the modeling of ambiguity and uncertainty in decision making fuzzy logic s fundamental idea is relatively straightforward statements indicate each input s degree of truth or falseness in addition to being either true or false the fundamental element of the idea is that fuzzy sets are defined by their membership functions 2 3 1 factor standardization by applying a fuzzy membership function the crisp input boundaries were transformed into a degree of membership with a value between 0 representing no membership zone and 1 denoting the entire membership zone zhang et al 2015 this process is known as fuzzification in other meaning fuzzification of the input variables application of the fuzzy operator in the antecedent degree of fulfillment the implication from the antecedent to the consequent inference aggregation of the consequents across the rules and defuzzification are the typical steps in a fuzzy rule based model the goal of the fuzzy membership function is to combine the criterion layers into a single scale all classes in this inquiry were standardized using the fuzzy liner membership technique the fuzzy membership method works well when you want the fuzzy membership to be within a certain range and any negative or positive divergence from that range decreases the desirability the fuzzy linear eq 4 is as follows according to benz et al 2004 4 µ x 0 if x min 1 if x max x min max min otherwise 2 3 2 fuzzy overlay we must overlay the criteria after scaling each criterion and utilizing fuzzy membership methods to translate values between the 0 and 1 interval criteria can be overlaid using fuzzy operators the choice of an operator depends on how the variables interact or how the operator s final impact incremental or decreasing is on the criteria all of the fuzzified raster inputs were combined using the fuzzy overlay technique lee 2007 the literature raines et al 2010 baidya et al 2014 lewis et al 2014 mallik et al 2021 raad et al 2022 lists five different fuzzy combination operators fuzzy or fuzzy and fuzzy product fuzzy sum and fuzzy gamma 2 3 2 1 fuzzy and this operator completely disregards the high weights of the pixels and only takes into account the minimal degree of membership of the pixels to create the final map producing an extremely conservative outcome 2 3 2 2 fuzzy or the degree of membership in the final map is entered using this operator as the maximum pixel membership value across all combined maps as a result of ignoring low pixel weights an extremely optimistic output is produced 2 3 2 3 fuzzy product the degree of membership of a pixel in various maps is multiplied by the fuzzy product the final membership is reduced by this operator each pixel typically has very little weight assigned to it and if there are several input maps this weight tends to be zero 2 3 2 4 fuzzy sum the ultimate membership value of the pixels in the final map will tend to be 1 if there are numerous input maps this operator is appropriate for modeling and is employed when parameters reinforce one another 2 3 2 5 fuzzy gamma operator the product and sum operators are combined to create the gamma fuzzy operator by choosing the appropriate gamma value growing and decreasing criteria can be combined concurrently and the product and sum operators increasing and decreasing inclinations will be combined according to baidya et al 2014 and raad et al 2022 the generic function eq 5 is as follows 5 μ combinaison i 1 n μ i for fuzzy algebraic product i n μ i 1 for fuzzy algebraic product fuzzy algebraic sum λ fuzzy algebraic product 1 λ for fuzzy gamma in this equation μi is the fuzzy membership function for the ith map maps i 1 2 n are to be combined λ is a constant chosen in the range 0 1 a judicious choice of λ may control eventual abrupt variation of output values derived from sum and product operators the criteria have been overlaid in this study using the fuzzy sum operator because we believe that the parameters reinforce one another admittedly each parameter has a significant contribution to groundwater occurrence or yield but their combination gives a clear overview of the groundwater potential in the region and leads to an important decision making tool which is the gwp map hence the fuzzy sum stands as the most appropriate operator in addition this operator does not bias the final result in the case of repetition or redundancy of a parameter the suitability analysis was created using gis technologies and was based on multiple criterion layers in arcgis 10 8 all criterion layers were combined to provide a map with a fuzzy overlay showing the ideal spot for drilling new groundwater wells fig 3 depicts the appropriateness model s flowchart the fuzzy overlay tool can be used in a multi criteria superposition analysis to analyze the likelihood that a phenomenon falling under many categories will occur 3 results and discussion key findings are presented and discussed in this section hydrogeophysical data used in this analysis are presented in table 1 3 1 interpolation of the criteria layers the criterion layers were used to evaluate the gis and hydro geoelectric factor combination s results using the gis method of aggregating intersections i e the values of depth resistivity thickness transverse resistivity transmissivity and hydraulic conductivity as indicated in fig 3 the idw interpolation method was applied to interpolate layers of hydro geoelectric parameters fig 4 depth values range from 6 to 80 m resistivity values range between 3 and 90 ω m the thickness ranges from 1 4 to 18 m transverse resistivity values ranging between 8 5 and 777 6 ω m2 transmissivity values range from 8 4 to 40 m2 day and hydraulic conductivity values vary from 0 0002 to 1 5 m day 3 2 site suitability model the initial step in developing a site relevance model was to harmonize all levels of the criterion the linear fuzzy membership flm method is used for this stage the fuzzy linear membership of the six criterion layers employed in this investigation is shown in fig 5 finally using a fuzzy sum operator these factors are integrated to create a suitability map as illustrated in fig 6 the research region was divided into four groups by the findings map excluded low suitability moderate suitability and high suitability table 2 displays the total area as well as the proportion of each category that has been determined and explained areas with high suitability are mainly located in the northern southern eastern and central parts of the region they cover an area of 35187 km2 for 54 76 of the study area areas with moderate suitability are found in the west south east and a tiny part of the north they occupy an area of 20353 km2 and represent a percentage of 31 68 areas with low suitability are located in the west south and a small part of the east and north they cover an area of 7866 km2 and represent a proportion of 12 24 unsuitable areas with almost inexistent groundwater potential are located in the west and north they occupy an area of 848 km2 for a proportion of 1 32 firstly each parameter was mapped individually and then processed in a gis environment using the fuzzy algebraic model to map gwp from which is derived the suitability map higher is gwp on a site the more the site is suitable to bear a borehole or a well a visual similarity of the parameters distribution reveals some correlations between the suitability map and hydro parameters distribution areas with the lowest aquifer depth are included in the zone with the highest suitability raad et al 2022 with the resistivity where a higher resistivity areas match with the lower suitability zone a more suitable zone covers most of the areas with low transverse resistance values areas with lower transmissivity perfectly fit with the less suitable zone this observation is also true for the hydraulic conductivity where the lowest values are found in the zone excluded according to its very low suitability the strong correlation between the above mentioned parameters generally determined by geophysical or hydrogeological methods and the suitability distribution confirms the significance of the hydrogeophysical approach in groundwater exploration in the region gupta 1997 jones 2000 anomohanran 2013 nshagali et al 2014 aretouyap et al 2018 aretouyap et al 2019b bisso et al 2019 however there is no clear relationship between aquifer thickness variability and sustainability distribution in the adamawa region and the whole of central africa there is growing interest in the exploitation of groundwater resources by households schools health centers etc the lack of appropriate geophysical investigations generally leads to unproductive wells and boreholes even when a geophysical survey is envisaged the extent of the area to be investigated is so high that an important financial resource is required the outcome of this study addresses both issues by demarcating the most suitable zone where to focus the geophysical survey or to directly drill boreholes or wells in case of the absence of geophysics material or professional with a clear demarcation of the gwp zones in the adamawa plateau the fuzzy algebraic model is a very useful tool for groundwater exploration its appropriate application may considerably reduce the time and costs of groundwater exploration while increasing the rate of successful and productive wells and boreholes it can be successfully applied to any other region worldwide however its accuracy depends on a prior hydrogeophysical survey that may determine parameters to be processed in a gis environment 4 conclusions while groundwater is becoming the main source of water in most towns and villages in central africa the number of unproductive wells continues to grow previous attempts to improve the wells and boreholes yield in the adamawa region felt because related investigations addressed various hydro parameters individually and separately fifty ves points were interpreted in this article using the schlumberger configuration contributing parameters aquifer depth resistivity thickness transverse resistivity transmissivity and hydraulic conductivity to gwp derived from this interpretation are combined using the fuzzy algebraic model on a gis environment to demarcate gwp zones according to the gwp category the study area is classified into four suitability levels high moderate low and null covering 54 76 35187 km2 31 66 20353 km2 12 24 7866 km2 and 1 32 848 km2 of the total study area respectively this approach provides key information on the suitability of a site to bear a productive borehole for lasting and sustainable exploitation the fuzzy algebraic model demonstrates its ability to demarcate suitable zone to implement productive wells and boreholes in the adamawa region this article is a strategic document to support planners stakeholders decision makers and municipal authorities in their msd however the approach used cannot stand alone without prior classical geophysical and hydrological surveys for determining hydro parameters to be processed ideally a minimum of six independent parameters are needed for a reliable assessment although the approach is reported to be effective swift universal and advised for the analytical hierarchy process it is strongly recommended to densify investigation

7878,study region quaternary tectonic basin beneath the osaka plain southwest japan study focus groundwaters of different sources were categorized by the cluster analysis using six components cl alkalinity na and ca2 δ18o and δ2h and the following characterization by the relationships between δ18o and δ2h and among cl b and li concentrations and li isotopic ratios then three dimensional mapping was applied to visualize the distribution of the categorized groundwater masses in the whole basin new hydrological insights for the region the sources of groundwater was categorized into two freshwater and three saline water end members 1 modern local meteoric water in the aquifers to depths of 300 m beneath the plain and surrounding mountains 2 fossil freshwater that is more depleted in δ18o and δ2h and enriched in alkalinity than the other 3 modern seawater recharged since the last submergence appearing in mostly to depths of 300 m beneath the plain 4 fossil seawater probably recharged before the last submergence remaining in the base of the basin and 5 deep seated arima type brine appearing along perimeter active faults at the northern and southern boundaries of the plain the method used here successfully visualize the different groundwater masses and will be applicable to evaluate the sustainability of groundwater resources in the similar hydrogeological settings such as coastal plains of asian countries graphical abstract ga1 keywords oxygen and hydrogen isotopes lithium isotopes saline groundwater active faults tectonic basin data availability the data used in this study are listed in the tables of supplementary information 1 introduction the osaka plain in southwest japan is located in the osaka basin one of the largest groundwater basins in japan during the middle 20th century groundwater beneath the osaka plain was increasingly used for industrial and domestic purposes yamamoto 1999 after the end of world war ii groundwater related disasters such as salinization and land subsidence maximum 2 7 m as well as subsequent meteorological disasters occurred until the 1960s the uptake of groundwater was 851 103 m3 day in 1965 territory of osaka prefecture corresponding to this study area osaka prefecture 2019 since then groundwater has not been actively used under regulation 300 103 m3 day after 2005 osaka prefecture 2019 in the osaka plain except in preparation for emergency use especially after the 1995 hyogo ken nambu earthquake the epicenter of which was located at the northwestern edge of osaka bay in the western osaka basin and the 2011 tohoku earthquake off the pacific coast of japan however effective use of groundwaters to mitigate further damage to groundwater systems requires appropriate management on the basis of a basin wide understanding of groundwater origins flow paths and residence times the chemistry of groundwater from osaka plain aquifers has been reported since the late 1950s e g kurata et al 1957 iwatsu et al 1960 tsurumaki 1962 1972 until following severe restrictions enacted in the 1970s on groundwater extraction over wide areas of the plain to mitigate such disasters there were no further reports of groundwater chemistry from the 1980s to the 2000s groundwater flow at depths down to 300 m from surface of the osaka plain has been inferred on the basis of geochemical datasets that include major dissolved components and hydrogen and oxygen isotopic compositions nakaya et al 2009 salinization appeared in the area below sea level and it must be caused by modern seawater infiltration at least down to 100 m depth from the ground surface in coastal aquifers e g makino et al 2010 fossil seawater was reported since 1970s in the eastern part of the osaka plain kawachi plain tsurumaki 1972 however its extent has not been documented in addition to the salinization by the present and fossil seawaters saline groundwater plausibly derived from subduction related deep seated fluids has been identified in mountainous areas around the osaka plain e g kazahaya et al 2014 and in the deepest part of the basin morikawa et al 2008 continuities of seawater derived and deep seated saline groundwaters have not been documented while the increasing number of deep wells drilled for hot spa development now provide geochemical data on deep aquifers near the base of the basin in this study we performed three dimensional 3 d mapping of groundwater geochemistry before and after cluster analysis to visualize the distribution of the groundwater masses derived from different sources beneath the osaka plain computer based mapping that can visualize the 3 d hydrogeological structure of sedimentary basins has been widely used to evaluate groundwater resources e g oh et al 2011 groundwater flow systems e g gill et al 2011 vu et al 2014 hassen et al 2016 and groundwater contamination vulnerability e g ducci and sellerino 2013 geochemical data including chemical and isotopic compositions has been combined with 3 d basin mapping to understand the connectivity of recharging waters and groundwater residence times e g raiber et al 2012 2015 these previous studies proved that 3 d mapping is a powerful tool for understanding geological controls on the hydrogeochemistry of entire basins and evaluating the sustainability of groundwater resources multivariable statistical analyses msas are useful for extracting specific geochemical features from large sample database they have been commonly applied to distinguish between groundwater samples with different sources and affected by different hydrogeochemical processes e g güler and thyne 2004 belkhiri et al 2011 iwamori et al 2020 we performed cluster analysis among the msas to roughly categorize groundwaters characterized by the combination of major dissolved ions and water stable isotope ratios δ18o and δ2h then the groundwater types were subsequently discriminated on the basis of additional geochemical data i e cl b li systematics and li isotopes finally we show the 3 d distribution of individual groundwater masses derived from distinct sources present beneath the plain these results will be useful for visualize the reservoir condition and evaluating the sustainability of groundwater resources in this region also the method we performed in this study will be applicable for the management of basin scale groundwater resources especially where the severe disasters occur due to the excess of groundwater uptake in the similar hydrogeological situation such as the coastal plain of asian countries 2 description of study area 2 1 geography and climate the osaka plain is surrounded by low mountains of which altitude is from 200 to 1000 m above sea level the hokusetsu and rokko mountains to the north the ikoma mountains to the east and the izumi mountains to the south fig 1c the west is osaka bay and awaji island is the western border of the basin active faults related to the formation of the osaka basin are recognized within the basin and around at its perimeter fig 1b which will be described in the next section the plain including low land and plateaus are mostly urbanized comprising one of the most populated areas in japan 10 million population live in the area of 1600 km2 of osaka prefecture and southeastern part of hyogo prefecture cultivated field widely distribute in the hilly area especially in the southern part of senboku hill and forest covers the mountains of this study most of the groundwater samples were taken from the territory of osaka prefecture as supply sources of freshwater inflow of two large river systems is important yodo river originating from biwa lake and yamato river the inflow rate of yodo river water from eastern kyoto basin upstream eastern basin is about 163 m3 s and that of yamato river is 13 5 m3 s ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism 2021 the water of yodo river supplies 90 of total water resources of osaka plain 1 1 109 m3 yr for domestic and industrial purposes osaka prefecture 2019 main channel of yamato river in the osaka plain artificially changed in 1704 to flow directly western osaka bay the water has not been used for domestic purpose since 1978 when the water pollution became serious average annual temperature and precipitation are 17 1 c and the lowest and highest temperatures are 6 2 c in january and 29 0 c in august average annual precipitation is 1340 mm 1991 2020 and comprising about 80 precipitation during march to october with the maximum 185 mm in june average 1991 2020 observation at osaka city japan meteorological agency 2021 evapotranspiration rate is about 700 mm yr ozawa et al 2012 based on the water balance calculation 15 30 of precipitation infiltrated into the underground in the urban area of osaka yoden et al 2004 2 2 active faults and geology the osaka basin has developed in association with fault movements since 3 3 3 ma biswas et al 1999 yoshikawa and mitamura 1999 kato et al 2008 triggered by a change in direction of the northwestward subduction of the philippine sea plate into the nankai trough fig 1a e g ide et al 2010 the western half of the basin subsided to form osaka bay fig 1b and its eastern half the osaka plain has been emergent since the last holocene marine transgression the maximum thicknesses of sediments in the basin are 2700 m beneath the bay iwabuchi 2000 and 1500 m beneath the plain yoshikawa and mitamura 1999 the perimeter faults clearly separate the surrounding low mountains from the plain the arima takatsuki fault to the north the ikoma fault system to the east and the habikino and uchihata faults to the south called the uchihata fault system herein the uchihata faults for convenience the uchihata faults are part of the median tectonic line mtl one of the largest active fault systems in japan the uemachi faults cross the center of the osaka plain in the north and diverge in the south to form two major faults one of which runs along the coastline the uemachi plateau an uplifted area to the east of the uemachi fault system divides the plain into two subplains the kawachi plain in the east and the nishi osaka plain in the west fig 1c activity on the uemachi fault system increased at around 0 8 ma huzita and kasama 1982 the arima takatsuki fault is primarily a strike slip fault although small vertical displacements 0 06 0 2 m kyr have been identified e g sangawa 1978 in the osaka plain holocene sediments deposited after the last glacial period 11 700 years ago including the uppermost marine clay layer ma13 in fig 2 6000 years ago cover wide areas of the lowlands of the two subplains fig 1b c plio pleistocene sediments of the osaka group the miyakojima and tanaka formations and the lower part of the namba formation fill the osaka basin beneath holocene deposits fig 2 in the tanaka formation 20 marine clay layers 15 of which are named deposited in association with sea level fluctuations are intercalated with freshwater sedimentary layers the upper part of the tanaka formation above marine clay layer ma9 corresponds to terrace deposits on the uemachi plateau and the surrounding hills such as senri hill and senboku hill fig 1c yoshikawa and mitamura 1999 the underlying miyakojima formation consists entirely of freshwater sediments the boundary between tanaka and miyakojima formations are at the depths of 300 700 m from the ground surface at the central part of the plain the age of the sediments at the base of the miyakojima formation just above the basement is 3 ma and that of the oldest marine clay layer ma 1 is 1 2 ma biswas et al 1999 yoshikawa and mitamura 1999 the basement rocks are mostly cretaceous ryoke granitoids with some cretaceous volcanic rocks in the northern part of the basin and minor amounts of miocene volcanic rocks and cretaceous sedimentary rocks in the south 2 3 hydrogeology unconfined aquifer distributes in a gravel layer overlying the ma13 marine clay layer the uppermost gravel layer below the ma13 and the sand layers in the tanaka formation form confined aquifers that have been used extensively as groundwater resources groundwater in the tanaka formation especially from depths of 100 300 m is presently used for both public and private water supplies the marine clay layers in the tanaka formation form aquitards whereas the lack of continuous clay layers in the miyakojima formation means that the aquifers there are not effectively separated groundwater in the miyakojima formation and the underlying basement rocks provides the main water resource for commercial hot spas the aquifers of the osaka plain are separated into four groups in this study on the basis of stratigraphy ai to aiv fig 2 aquifers of group ai are in sedimentary layers shallower than ma9 and consist of unconfined and confined aquifers in fluvial terrace deposits in plateaus and hills and equivalent deposits of the tanaka formation beneath the lowlands of the osaka plain these aquifers receive the direct infiltration of surface waters from both rivers and the sea makino et al 2010 the water of the yodo river recharges ai aquifers along its course and seawater also recharge from the coast and the channel bottom of yodo river system of the area where the ground surface is below sea level yamato river is not important source for groundwater however its water would recharge the ai aquifer of the southern part of kawachi basin where flood plain along the old channels before 1704 extends nakaya et al 2009 aii aquifers lie between marine clay layers the lowermost ma 1 and ma9 in the tanaka formation at depths of 100 600 m beneath the lowland plain which is covered by holocene sediment excessive extraction of groundwater from these aquifers caused serious subsidence until the 1970s due to dewatering and the resultant compression of the over and underlying marine clay layers belonging aii thus the uptake of groundwater from these aquifers has been regulated across the wide area of the lowland plain deeper part of ai aquifer and upper half of aii aquifer between ma12 and ma6 are recharged by the precipitation at the senri and senboku hills and foot of ikoma mountains where the equivalent sediments to the aquifer sediments distribute on the ground surface committee of groundwater recharge studies 2003 aiii aquifers occur in the miyakojima formation and equivalent formations on the hills and plateaus which are older than marine clay layer ma 1 precipitation must be important recharge source of the aquifer the groundwaters of these aquifers are mostly used for hot spas aiv aquifers are in the basement rocks aquifers in the mountains surrounding the osaka plain are included in this category because the groundwater there flows in basement rocks in our previous study shintani et al 2019 groundwater aquifer types iii and iv were not separated however our recognition of deep seated arima type brines herein saline waters that have experienced elevated temperatures as will be mentioned later e g matsubaya et al 1973 led us to separate them here specific capacities m3 d m of each aquifer were estimated as the followings ikawa et al 2019 ai 1895 3 3 av 234 n 176 aii 2467 0 5 av 249 n 561 aiii 3936 0 5 av 299 n 209 aiv 3176 0 9 av 196 n 71 the specific capacities of wells of ai and aii tend to be higher in the coastal and northern inland areas along the yodo river among those of west osaka plain especially beneath the hilly areas while those do not change in the kawachi plain the specific capacities are higher in the area along the yodo river among wells of aiii and aiv geochemistry of groundwaters of the whole osaka plain were first documented by nakaya et al 2009 na ca hco3 type freshwater was abundant in the hilly area at the foot of surrounding mountains also the similar type of groundwaters appeared at the center of the plain in the aquifers 20 m depths from the surface of uemachi plateau the distribution of na ca hco3 type freshwater indicates the recharge of studied groundwaters in these hills and plateau na hco3 type freshwater was the most abundant in the unconfined and confined aquifers at the center of the plain beneath the holocene sediments indicating stagnant condition of these aquifers nakaya et al 2009 makino et al 2010 makino et al 2010 also documented the na cl type saline groundwaters distributing in the ai aquifer of the nishi osaka plain due to seawater invasion another type of na cl saline groundwaters were found from the aquifers iii and iv most of which were arima type brine ex shintani et al 2019 as will be discussed later 3 material and methods 3 1 groundwater samples and analytical methods groundwater samples

jamstec 3 2 database of groundwater chemistry and geology a database of groundwater chemistry was established from the results of analytical studies of groundwaters within the osaka basin published since 2008 nakaya et al 2009 osaka prefecture 2008 2010 makino et al 2010 kobayashi et al 2013 shintani et al 2019 and new data obtained in this study the procedures of sampling and chemical and isotope analyses were described in each publication all these studies except the work by kobayashi et al 2013 were reported by our group for the data sets of our previous and present studies analytical procedures of dissolved chemical components were the same among those studies while the stable isotopes of waters δ2h and δ18o were analyzed by conventional mass spectrometry for co2 and h2

well from sea level concentrations of cl alkalinity na and ca2 and δ18o and δ2h these four dissolved components and two isotopic compositions were selected because they can be applied to detect differences in sources and geochemical processes after recharging if more than two samples with complete information were available for the same well the recent data were chosen in total data for 476

enough to categorize the sources and reaction process in aquifers at permeable ca dominant and stagnant na dominant condition the cluster analysis was done for the data sets of the four aquifers euclidean distance among these components were calculated then the ward s method was applied to cluster the groundwater samples 3 4 mapping of geology and groundwater chemistry the open source gis geographic resources analysis support system grass was used to draw the 3 d maps produced in this study although grass is made up of modules that can be customized according to users particular needs carrera hernández and gaskin 2006 the 3 d geochemical maps produced herein were drawn using the standard unmodified modules of grass v6 4 2 the 50 m grid elevation data were input to grass to visualize the topographic surface the locations of marine clay layers and basement rocks were imported and rasterized in grass after converting depth to elevation the geochemical data and groundwater sampling locations were converted from world geodetic system 1984 wgs84 to universal transverse mercator utm coordinates and input as point data the 3 d hydrogeological maps were produced by combining the data with the 3 d visualization tool nviz in grass the 3 d topographic map covers an area of 5400 km2 total map area shown as red square 90 60 km in fig 1b whereas the holocene layers cover an area of 2072 km2 at the surface of the maps a combined map of topographic surfaces with elevations 100 m above sea level and the surface of basement rocks beneath the osaka plain was produced to represent the basin geometry water samples from deep wells in aquifers aii aiii and aiv were taken from multiple strainers well depth was used as the vertical coordinate for mapping the spatial distributions of the geochemical and isotopic data for example the total length of strainers for a deep well drilled for a hot spa was 150 m within each 300 m depth interval drilled thus the chemical characteristics of individual samples from each of those aquifers may reflect the characteristics of mixed groundwaters from multiple aquifers 4 results analytical results for groundwater samples obtained in this study and other previous studies are provided in the supplementary information materials for fresh groundwaters results are provided separately for each aquifer supplementary tables s1 s4 and as average values for groundwater clusters supplementary table s5 the results for saline groundwaters from all aquifers are listed in supplementary table s6 list of samples for analyzed δ7li and the references are in supplementary tables s7 and s8 4 1 mapping of topography geology and geochemistry the distributions of cl concentrations alkalinity and δ18o values of groundwater in aquifers ai to aiv were plotted on 3 d maps figs 3 5 the 3 d maps clearly show undulations in the geologic succession that increase with depth reflecting the uneven subsidence of the basin associated with repetitive fault movements in figs 3 5 ma9 in panel a ma 1 in b and basement in c and d in addition the major active faults bounding the basin are apparent as steep slopes in the basement rocks fault names are given in figs 1b surface map and 3c 3 d map the results of our geochemical mapping are described below 4 1 1 chloride concentrations in ai groundwater samples with cl concentrations 3 meq l were identified in the coastal area and inland areas along the yodo river where the altitude is below sea level areas within the red line in fig 3a cl concentrations 3 meq l were detected only in the shallow part of aii red line fig 3b overlapping the spatial extent of similar waters in ai therefore it is concluded that modern seawater that migrated along the yodo river and seawater that migrated along the uemachi faults during the last submergence have infiltrated through ai into aii a sample with 100 meq l cl was recovered from aii along the arima takatsuki fault groundwater with cl 30 meq l was identified in the lowermost part of aiii in the deepest part of the basin red line fig 3c some of these samples were collected along the slopes of the uemachi and uchihata faults groundwater samples from aiv occasionally showed cl concentrations 10 meq l red lines fig 3d these saline groundwaters were obtained along the arima takatsuki and uchihata faults and from the deepest part of the basin bottom along the uemachi fault 4 1 2 alkalinity groundwater samples with alkalinity 6 meq l in ai areas within the red line in fig 4a were identified in the same area as those with high cl concentrations 3 meq l because those high cl concentrations were a result of seawater contamination as noted above this high alkalinity was likely promoted by sulfate reduction associated with the decomposition of organic matter to release hco3 makino et al 2010 in aii groundwaters with alkalinity 6 meq l were identified mostly in samples from the foothills of the mountains and on the uemachi plateau which are likely groundwater recharge areas areas within the blue line in fig 4b groundwaters with alkalinity between 6 and 12 meq l areas with the red line fig 4b were identified in the deeper part of aii beneath the lowland of the osaka plain in the same region as groundwaters with δ18o 8 fig 5b see section 4 1 3 groundwaters with alkalinity between 3 and 6 meq l were identified in aiii along the foothills of the mountains as was the case for aii indicating that these aquifers are recharged by surface water alkalinity 6 meq l was abundantly identified in the deeper part of aiii and along the uchihata faults on the slope of izumi mountains area within red line fig 4c groundwaters from aiv with alkalinity between 6 and 12 meq l occur along the uemachi faults northern slope of izumi mountains fig 4d and those with alkalinity 10 meq l along the arima takatsuki including arima and uchihata faults including ishobotoke areas within red lines fig 4d both of these areas overlap regions where high cl concentrations were identified in aiii and aiv 4 1 3 oxygen isotopes groundwaters from ai showed limited δ18o variations with values mostly between 8 0 and 6 0 except for some samples from near the coast where higher δ18o values are likely associated with seawater infiltration areas within the red line in fig 5a the range of δ18o values for groundwaters from aii was similar to that for ai fig 5b it is notable that δ18o values below 8 0 were obtained from samples from deeper parts of aii red line fig 5b the δ18o values of aiii groundwaters collected from the hills at the edge of the basin blue line fig 5c were 8 0 to 6 0 similar to those from ai and the shallow part of aii indicating that the hilly area corresponds to the recharge area groundwater with δ18o 8 0 mainly occurred in the center of the basin especially in the deeper part of aiii and these groundwaters seemed to be isolated from the shallower part of this aquifer most of the aiv groundwaters from the mountain area showed δ18o values between 7 0 and 6 0 within the range of local meteoric water there fig 5d whereas those with δ18o values 6 0 were identified in the basement rocks of the mountains south and north of the basin ishibotoke and the surrounding area and arima in fig 3d and the center of the basin purple line fig 3d 4 2 cluster analysis results of the cluster analysis are reported in supplementary tables in which the data are summarized according to the clusters in each aquifer for convenience the clustered dataset was separated into freshwaters cl 3 meq l tables s1 s4 and saline waters cl 3 meq l table s6 and the average compositions of each clustered freshwater group are provided in supplementary table s5 the clustered groundwater groups were confirmed the correspondence among those of the four aquifers according to the geochemistry the relations between δ18o and δ2h and between δ18o and alkalinity of fresh groundwaters cl 3 meq l for aquifers ai to aiv are plotted in figs 6 and 7 most fresh groundwaters fall within the range of the modern local meteoric water however the cluster analysis separated the groundwater samples in each aquifer into two to four groups with different isotopic ranges and alkalinities in particular highly elevated alkalinity with low δ18o values were observed for the groundwaters in aiv on the basis of these relations the freshwater samples can be categorized into two groups one with low alkalinity and rather high stable isotopic ranges fw1 open symbols in figs 6 and 7 and the other with high alkalinity and lower stable isotopic ranges fw2 closed symbols in figs 6 and 7 although cluster analysis is suitable for screening samples some exceptional samples are included in each cluster in this study saline waters are occasionally difficult to separate into groups with distinctive geochemical characteristics for example in the δ18o vs δ2h plot fig 8a there are two obvious trends for the saline waters cl 40 meq l from aiii and aiv some samples plot along the mixing line between seawater and local meteoric water mlsw mixing line with seawater whereas others plot on a different trend pink line labeled arima type brine the data points that plot away from the mixing line can be separated into two additional different groups as described below the relation between cl concentration and δ2h demonstrates that groundwater samples clearly show differences among clusters of saline waters fig 8b the samples from ai and aii except one sample from aii plot along the mixing trend between local meteoric water and seawater light blue triangle fig 8b however most saline waters of aiii plot below this mixing area on or below the mixing line between arima type brine and modern local meteoric water pink line fig 8b this result indicates that the saline waters in aiii and aiv are diluted with not only modern local meteoric water but also another freshwater having low δ2h and δ18o values to separate the two or more saline waters originated different sources relation between δ18o and δ2h relations among cl b li and δ7li were used as described in the following section 4 3 cl b li systematics and δ7li li and b can be used as indicators of the high temperature history of groundwater especially in deep aquifers because li and b are released into solution by reactions between pore fluid and rocks sediments at temperatures 100 c for li and 50 c for b and subsequently remain in solution as the temperature decreases you et al 1996 james et al 2003 clay minerals adsorb b at temperatures below 40 c palmer et al 1987 and b is released into porewater through desorption from clay minerals and or illitization of smectite hüpers and kopf 2012 thus it is plausible that b was released into the groundwater via reaction with marine clay minerals in the basin at temperatures near or above 40 c covariations of cl b li concentrations are known to indicate the origin of saline waters e g osawa et al 2010 the relation among those components is shown for groundwaters with cl 1 meq l fig 9 the dataset used for drawing this figure is summarized in supplementary table s7 most data points fall within the area of groundwater affected by modern fossil seawater in the host sediments and or formation water that has reacted with clay rich sediments light blue shaded area highly saline waters tend to plot near seawater and diluted ones close to the b end member thus these groundwaters have been affected by seawater infiltration or interactions with clay minerals in the host sediment but have not experienced high temperature conditions that would have released considerable amounts of li one sample of aii one sample of aiii and some aiv saline waters fall beyond this area and some plot on the typical arima type brine red circle indicated with atb known to have experienced high temperature reactions 280 c e g masuda et al 1986 the δ7li values of groundwaters from aiii and aiv range from 1 7 to 14 fig 10 considerably lower than the δ7li value of modern seawater 31 e g chan and edmond 1988 misra and froelich 2009 most groundwater samples with 1 mg l li had δ7li values of 9 to 14 suggesting that these values are the range of background δ7li values for groundwater that has reacted with host sediments in the osaka plain or basement sedimentary rocks values of δ7li lower than this background range e g 1 7 at arima spa and 4 0 at ishibotoke appeared only in the mountains and along active perimeter faults fig 10b groundwaters with high alkalinity and slightly low δ7li values relative to the most beneath the plain occur in the izumi mountains pink shaded area labeled deep co2 added water in fig 10a this distribution of low δ7li values and high alkalinity implies that hydrothermal fluids upwell along these faults discussed in section 5 3 5 discussion the studied groundwaters were categorized on the basis of our cluster analysis and additional information on δ18o δ2h cl b li systematics and δ7li see flow chart in fig 11 five end members can be discriminated for the osaka plain groundwater of which two are freshwater and three are saline water 5 1 freshwaters fw1 and fw2 fresh groundwaters with rather high δ2h and δ18o values and low alkalinity abbreviated fw1 which originated from local meteoric water occur down to 100 m depth beneath the plain and 300 m depth in the hill and mountain areas this water type can also be found below 300 m depth from the surface along the uemachi and uchihata faults figs 12a 1 b 1 the dominant chemistry of this water is ca hco3 type suggesting active groundwater flow na hco3 type groundwaters were found in the ai aquifer beneath the lowland part of the plain indicating stagnant flow conditions the δ18o and δ2h values of fw1 groundwaters range from 5 5 to 8 and 40 to 55 respectively freshwaters with relatively low δ2h and δ18o values and relatively higher alkalinity than fw1 abbreviated fw2 occur widely in the deeper part of the plain figs 12a 2 b 2 fw2 is dominated by na hco3 type freshwater fw2 groundwaters did not originate from modern meteoric water because fw2 is isolated from the recharge areas of waters with comparable isotopic characteristics i e the surrounding mountains fig 5 the δ2h and δ18o values of fw2 decrease from aii through aiii to aiv implying the occurrence of some process that promotes isotopic fractionation in fw2 depletion of δ18o and δ2h in fresh groundwater relative to local meteoric water as observed in fw2 would be explained by the recharge of originally low δ18o and δ2h precipitation groundwater in coastal basins is generally categorized into four groups on the basis of recharge age modern groundwater pre industrial water 10 000 200 a late pleistocene groundwater 20 10 ka and water from older formations which occasionally exhibits high salinity edmunds 2001 ikawa et al 2014a groundwaters that originated from precipitation and melting of ice after the last glaciation had low δ18o values edmunds 2001 such groundwaters have been found in japan at depths 300 m for example at horonobe in hokkaido and beneath the kanto plain ikawa et al 2014b yasuhara et al 2008 2011 as noted above fossil seawater probably recharged during the latest submergence is known to exist in the aquifers above ma6 as categorized ai and aii in this study beneath the kawachi plain eastern osaka plain tsurumaki 1972 morikawa et al 2014 the residence time of groundwater at depths of up to 1500 m in the deepest part of the osaka plain at kobe city in the northeastern edge of the basin has been estimated to be 25 230 kyr morikawa et al 2005 pre dating the peak of the last glacial maximum thus it is plausible that the fw2 recharged during the early to middle pleistocene still remains in the aii aquifers beneath the ma6 marine clay layer the residence time of fresh groundwaters in aiii and aiv would have a similar or longer temporal range the timing of recharge cannot be determined in this study for most of the aquifers in the osaka plain especially those recharged in pre industrial times owing to a lack of age data however the recharging period of fw2 might become older with increasing depth from the last glacial period the previous study explained the depletion of δ18o and δ2h by diagenetic alteration processes i e ultrafiltration during passage through thick sedimentary sequences shintani et al 2019 when the ultrafiltration occurs depletion rates in δ2h by 2 5 and in δ18o by 0 8 ca 3 1 coplen and hanshaw 1973 some of the freshwaters may be experienced this process because the δ18o and δ2h were plotted on the trend of such depletion indicated as arrows in figs 6c and 6d however large analytical error of δ2h cannot be eliminated since a few waters from aiii and aiv taken from the same sampling period gave higher d values than the range of local meteoric waters plots out of light blue shaded areas in figs 6c and 6d most of the freshwaters of fw2 of aiii and aiv are plotted on the gmwl thus it is plausible that the precipitation before the last submergence was the source of fw2 waters and the effect of ultrafiltration would be limited 5 2 saline waters saline waters are categorized into three groups two seawater influenced waters sw1 and sw2 and deep seated water sw1 is identified as seawater contaminated groundwater diluted with fw1 dark blue points in fig 13a reversals in the flow of seawater in the ai aquifer take place as a result of tidal changes at sea level especially in the yodo river system in the western part of the lowland nishi osaka plain see figs 1 3 makino et al 2010 seawater has run up to the eastern border of the basin along the yodo river since 1964 when a weir ozeki was built to control the water flow of the yodo river thus the seawater of sw1 is modern seawater that has infiltrated the western part of the plain whereas slightly older pre 1964 seawater may have influenced the inland area as noted above fossil seawater has previously been identified in aquifers above the ma6 clay layer of the kawachi plain the lowland east of the uemachi plateau e g tsurumaki 1972 and has been reported to have been recharged during the last holocene transgression 7 5 ka morikawa et al 2014 in aii the old seawater recharged during the last submergence would be included especially in the inland aquifers another type of saline water containing a seawater component is present in aiii and aiv sw2 light blue points in fig 13a in the cl b li diagram the sw2 samples plot in the mixing area between seawater and the b enriched endmember light blue shaded area in fig 9 and the δ7li values indicate reaction with host sediments or rocks as noted in section 4 4 this type of saline water occurs at the bottom of the basin even in the inland area away from the yodo river fig 13a thus the source of salinity of sw2 cannot be modern seawater although the timing of recharge of the seawater of sw2 is unclear the seawater will be fossil rather than modern seawater plots of cl vs δ2h of sw2 align on the area of seawater diluted with 2h depleted freshwater the area roughly indicated with blue ellipse in fig 8 b thus the other end member of sw2 would mostly likely be fw2 arima type brine atb have experienced high temperatures in this study atb red points in fig 13 was identified among the saline groundwaters that had undergone high temperature reactions evidenced by high li cl ratios and low δ7li values 5 figs 9 10 groundwaters in the same cluster which have δ18o δ2h and cl b li values similar to those of atb were also categorized as atb the atb waters includes another cluster defined as atb 2 which are atbs diluted with low δ18o and δ2h freshwater orange points in fig 13 two saline groundwaters fab green points in fig 13 which exhibit δ18o and δ2h isotopic compositions similar to those of atb but low concentrations of b and li were found in the same area as sw2 implying a relation between fossil seawater and arima type brine arima type brine is named for the saline groundwaters found at arima and the surrounding area this brine is characterized by a heavy oxygen isotopic shift away from local meteoric water e g matsubaya et al 1973 sakai and matsubaya 1977 masuda et al 1986 and is known to contain mantle derived components such as he with high 3h 4he ratios e g nagao et al 1981 sano and wakita 1985 in addition the brines are characterized by very high li cl and li na ratios compared to seawater e g takamatsu et al 1986 kazahaya et al 2014 the origin of arima type brine has recently been attributed to dehydration of the subducting slab of the philippine sea plate e g kazahaya et al 2014 kusuda et al 2014 our mapping clearly shows that the arima type brine occurs around the rim of the basin including the foothills of the mountains and the fault slopes it is also possible that fossil seawater that infiltrated along faults into basement rocks and underwent high temperature water rock interactions might be a source of arima type brine 5 3 emanation of co2 from depth arima type brine commonly contains high amounts of free co2 and high alkalinity even when the temperature is low saline groundwaters with 10 meq l alkalinity appear only along active fault systems such as the arima takatsuki uemachi and uchihata faults fig 13b the locations of the high alkalinity saline groundwaters mostly overlap with those of arima type brine in particular it is notable that saline groundwaters in the southern mountains occasionally have high alkalinity similar brines discharge along the mtl in japan tanaka et al 2013 kazahaya et al 2014 kusuda et al 2014 and the discharge of this water at ishibotoke has been attributed to its proximity to a fault e g matsubaya et al 1973 morikawa et al 2016 found high alkalinity in groundwaters sampled along the mtl on the southern slope of the izumi mountains and suggested that phase separation during upwelling of deep seated fluids along the faults released co2 which dissolved in the surrounding groundwater co2 gas released by this mechanism must be upwelling over much of this mountainous area and becoming dissolved in local groundwater between the mtl and the divergent uchihata faults fresh groundwaters with high alkalinity recovered from the izumi mountains yielded δ7li values of 2 9 9 4 which are within the ranges of atb and waters known to have incorporated deep co2 fig 10a in particular δ7li values 7 5 suggest that the co2 dissolved in arima type brine is separated and trapped in the fresh groundwaters in this area although the samples of fw2 from aiv contained no co2 gas they characteristically had high alkalinity in the southern part of the plain along the trend of the uemachi faults morikawa et al 2008 identified mantle derived he trapped in aquifers in the lowermost osaka plain sediments beneath the nishi osaka plain thus mantle derived co2 may move through the uemachi faults and become dissolved in the deepest groundwater to form hco3 6 conclusions three dimensional mapping demonstrated the presence of groundwater masses derived from different sources 1 local meteoric water i e precipitation and river water 2 freshwater that is inferred to be recharged before last glacial period and have been diagenetically altered 3 seawater with a wide range of recharge ages and 4 deep seated brine identified as arima type brine these groundwater masses are spatially separated in the aquifer basin it is clear that 3 d mapping is more useful in tracing the spatial distribution especially the vertical variation and constraints of geologic structure of different types of groundwater than conventional 2 d mapping both fresh and saline groundwaters from aquifers in the osaka plain are being used for domestic and industrial purposes mainly from aii and for commercial spas mainly from aiii and aiv however the results of 3 d geochemical mapping show that there are limits to the sustainable exploitation of these resources because actively flowing groundwater occurs only in the shallow part of the plain attention should be paid to the utilization of groundwater from the deep aquifers the 3 d maps produced here are a first step in providing the information necessary to sustainably manage groundwater resources in the osaka plain the 3 d maps also provide information on the relationships of deep groundwater to active tectonics e g subduction and dehydration of the philippine sea plate convection in the mantle wedge and inland fault activity and thus provide important data to improve our understanding of the water cycle at convergent plate margins method presented in this study for visualizing groundwater masses derived from different sources drawing 3 d mapping combined with

7878,study region quaternary tectonic basin beneath the osaka plain southwest japan study focus groundwaters of different sources were categorized by the cluster analysis using six components cl alkalinity na and ca2 δ18o and δ2h and the following characterization by the relationships between δ18o and δ2h and among cl b and li concentrations and li isotopic ratios then three dimensional mapping was applied to visualize the distribution of the categorized groundwater masses in the whole basin new hydrological insights for the region the sources of groundwater was categorized into two freshwater and three saline water end members 1 modern local meteoric water in the aquifers to depths of 300 m beneath the plain and surrounding mountains 2 fossil freshwater that is more depleted in δ18o and δ2h and enriched in alkalinity than the other 3 modern seawater recharged since the last submergence appearing in mostly to depths of 300 m beneath the plain 4 fossil seawater probably recharged before the last submergence remaining in the base of the basin and 5 deep seated arima type brine appearing along perimeter active faults at the northern and southern boundaries of the plain the method used here successfully visualize the different groundwater masses and will be applicable to evaluate the sustainability of groundwater resources in the similar hydrogeological settings such as coastal plains of asian countries graphical abstract ga1 keywords oxygen and hydrogen isotopes lithium isotopes saline groundwater active faults tectonic basin data availability the data used in this study are listed in the tables of supplementary information 1 introduction the osaka plain in southwest japan is located in the osaka basin one of the largest groundwater basins in japan during the middle 20th century groundwater beneath the osaka plain was increasingly used for industrial and domestic purposes yamamoto 1999 after the end of world war ii groundwater related disasters such as salinization and land subsidence maximum 2 7 m as well as subsequent meteorological disasters occurred until the 1960s the uptake of groundwater was 851 103 m3 day in 1965 territory of osaka prefecture corresponding to this study area osaka prefecture 2019 since then groundwater has not been actively used under regulation 300 103 m3 day after 2005 osaka prefecture 2019 in the osaka plain except in preparation for emergency use especially after the 1995 hyogo ken nambu earthquake the epicenter of which was located at the northwestern edge of osaka bay in the western osaka basin and the 2011 tohoku earthquake off the pacific coast of japan however effective use of groundwaters to mitigate further damage to groundwater systems requires appropriate management on the basis of a basin wide understanding of groundwater origins flow paths and residence times the chemistry of groundwater from osaka plain aquifers has been reported since the late 1950s e g kurata et al 1957 iwatsu et al 1960 tsurumaki 1962 1972 until following severe restrictions enacted in the 1970s on groundwater extraction over wide areas of the plain to mitigate such disasters there were no further reports of groundwater chemistry from the 1980s to the 2000s groundwater flow at depths down to 300 m from surface of the osaka plain has been inferred on the basis of geochemical datasets that include major dissolved components and hydrogen and oxygen isotopic compositions nakaya et al 2009 salinization appeared in the area below sea level and it must be caused by modern seawater infiltration at least down to 100 m depth from the ground surface in coastal aquifers e g makino et al 2010 fossil seawater was reported since 1970s in the eastern part of the osaka plain kawachi plain tsurumaki 1972 however its extent has not been documented in addition to the salinization by the present and fossil seawaters saline groundwater plausibly derived from subduction related deep seated fluids has been identified in mountainous areas around the osaka plain e g kazahaya et al 2014 and in the deepest part of the basin morikawa et al 2008 continuities of seawater derived and deep seated saline groundwaters have not been documented while the increasing number of deep wells drilled for hot spa development now provide geochemical data on deep aquifers near the base of the basin in this study we performed three dimensional 3 d mapping of groundwater geochemistry before and after cluster analysis to visualize the distribution of the groundwater masses derived from different sources beneath the osaka plain computer based mapping that can visualize the 3 d hydrogeological structure of sedimentary basins has been widely used to evaluate groundwater resources e g oh et al 2011 groundwater flow systems e g gill et al 2011 vu et al 2014 hassen et al 2016 and groundwater contamination vulnerability e g ducci and sellerino 2013 geochemical data including chemical and isotopic compositions has been combined with 3 d basin mapping to understand the connectivity of recharging waters and groundwater residence times e g raiber et al 2012 2015 these previous studies proved that 3 d mapping is a powerful tool for understanding geological controls on the hydrogeochemistry of entire basins and evaluating the sustainability of groundwater resources multivariable statistical analyses msas are useful for extracting specific geochemical features from large sample database they have been commonly applied to distinguish between groundwater samples with different sources and affected by different hydrogeochemical processes e g güler and thyne 2004 belkhiri et al 2011 iwamori et al 2020 we performed cluster analysis among the msas to roughly categorize groundwaters characterized by the combination of major dissolved ions and water stable isotope ratios δ18o and δ2h then the groundwater types were subsequently discriminated on the basis of additional geochemical data i e cl b li systematics and li isotopes finally we show the 3 d distribution of individual groundwater masses derived from distinct sources present beneath the plain these results will be useful for visualize the reservoir condition and evaluating the sustainability of groundwater resources in this region also the method we performed in this study will be applicable for the management of basin scale groundwater resources especially where the severe disasters occur due to the excess of groundwater uptake in the similar hydrogeological situation such as the coastal plain of asian countries 2 description of study area 2 1 geography and climate the osaka plain is surrounded by low mountains of which altitude is from 200 to 1000 m above sea level the hokusetsu and rokko mountains to the north the ikoma mountains to the east and the izumi mountains to the south fig 1c the west is osaka bay and awaji island is the western border of the basin active faults related to the formation of

one of the most populated areas in japan 10 million population live in the area of 1600 km2 of osaka prefecture and southeastern part of hyogo prefecture cultivated field widely distribute in the hilly area especially in the southern part of senboku hill and forest covers the mountains of this study most of the groundwater samples were taken from the territory of osaka prefecture as supply sources of freshwater inflow of two large river systems is important yodo river originating from biwa lake and yamato river the inflow rate of yodo river water from eastern kyoto basin upstream

the underground in the urban area of osaka yoden et al 2004 2 2 active faults and geology the osaka basin has developed in association with fault movements since 3 3 3 ma biswas et al 1999 yoshikawa and mitamura 1999 kato et al 2008 triggered by a change in direction of the northwestward subduction of the philippine sea plate into the nankai trough fig 1a e g ide et al 2010 the western half of the basin subsided to form osaka bay fig 1b and its eastern half the osaka plain has been emergent since the last holocene marine transgression the maximum thicknesses of sediments in the basin are 2700 m beneath the bay iwabuchi 2000 and 1500 m beneath the plain yoshikawa and mitamura 1999 the perimeter faults clearly separate the surrounding low mountains from the plain the arima takatsuki fault to the north the ikoma fault system to the east and the habikino and uchihata faults to the south called the uchihata fault system herein the uchihata faults for convenience the uchihata faults are part of the median tectonic line mtl one of the largest active fault systems in japan the uemachi faults cross the center of the osaka plain in the north and diverge in the south to form two major faults one of which runs along the coastline the uemachi plateau an uplifted area to the east of the uemachi fault system divides the plain into two subplains the kawachi plain in the east and the nishi osaka plain in the west fig 1c activity on the uemachi fault system increased at around 0 8 ma huzita and kasama 1982 the arima takatsuki fault is primarily a strike slip fault although small vertical displacements 0 06 0 2 m kyr have been identified e g sangawa 1978 in the osaka plain holocene sediments deposited after the last glacial period 11 700 years ago including the uppermost marine clay layer ma13 in fig 2 6000 years ago cover wide areas of the lowlands of the two subplains fig 1b c plio pleistocene sediments of the osaka group the miyakojima and tanaka formations and the lower part of the namba formation fill the osaka basin beneath holocene deposits fig 2 in the tanaka formation 20 marine clay layers 15 of which are named deposited in association with sea level fluctuations are intercalated with freshwater sedimentary layers the upper part of the tanaka formation above marine clay layer ma9 corresponds to terrace deposits on the uemachi plateau and the surrounding hills such as senri hill and senboku hill fig 1c yoshikawa and mitamura 1999 the underlying miyakojima formation consists entirely of freshwater sediments the boundary between tanaka and miyakojima formations are at the depths of 300 700 m from the ground surface at the central part of the plain the age of the sediments at the base of the miyakojima formation just above the basement is 3 ma and that of the oldest marine clay layer ma 1 is 1 2 ma biswas et al 1999 yoshikawa and mitamura 1999 the basement rocks are mostly cretaceous ryoke granitoids with some cretaceous volcanic rocks in the northern part of the basin and minor amounts of miocene volcanic rocks and cretaceous sedimentary rocks in the south 2 3 hydrogeology unconfined aquifer distributes in a gravel layer overlying the ma13 marine clay layer the uppermost gravel layer below the ma13 and the sand layers in the tanaka formation form confined aquifers that have been used extensively as groundwater resources groundwater in the tanaka formation especially from depths of 100 300 m is presently used for both public and private water supplies the marine clay layers in the tanaka formation form aquitards whereas the lack of continuous clay layers in the miyakojima formation means that the aquifers there are not effectively separated groundwater in the miyakojima formation and the underlying basement rocks provides the main water resource for commercial hot spas the aquifers of the osaka plain are separated into four groups in this study on the basis of stratigraphy ai to aiv fig 2 aquifers of group ai are in sedimentary layers shallower than ma9 and consist of unconfined and confined aquifers in fluvial terrace deposits in plateaus and hills and equivalent deposits of the tanaka formation beneath the lowlands of the osaka plain these aquifers receive the direct infiltration of surface waters from both rivers and the sea makino et al 2010 the water of the yodo river recharges ai aquifers along its course and seawater also recharge from the coast and the channel bottom of yodo river system of the area where the ground surface is below sea level yamato river is not important source for groundwater however its water would recharge the ai aquifer of the southern part of kawachi basin where flood plain along the old channels before 1704 extends nakaya et al 2009 aii aquifers lie between marine clay layers the lowermost ma 1 and ma9 in the tanaka formation at depths of 100 600 m beneath the lowland plain which is covered by holocene sediment excessive extraction of groundwater from these aquifers caused serious subsidence until the 1970s due to dewatering and the resultant compression of the over and underlying marine clay layers belonging aii thus the uptake of groundwater from these aquifers has been regulated across the wide area of the lowland plain deeper part of ai aquifer and upper half of aii aquifer between ma12 and ma6 are recharged by the precipitation at the senri and senboku hills and foot of ikoma mountains where the equivalent sediments to the aquifer sediments distribute on the ground surface committee of groundwater recharge studies 2003 aiii aquifers occur in the miyakojima formation and equivalent formations on the hills and plateaus which are older than marine clay layer ma 1 precipitation must be important recharge source of the aquifer the groundwaters of these aquifers are mostly used for hot spas aiv aquifers are in the basement rocks aquifers in the mountains surrounding the osaka plain are included in this category because the groundwater there flows in basement rocks in our previous study shintani et al 2019 groundwater aquifer types iii and iv were not separated however our recognition of deep seated arima type brines herein saline waters that have experienced elevated temperatures as will be mentioned later e g matsubaya et al 1973 led us to separate them here specific capacities m3 d m of each aquifer were estimated as the followings ikawa et al 2019 ai 1895 3 3 av 234 n 176 aii 2467 0 5 av 249 n 561 aiii 3936 0 5 av 299 n 209 aiv 3176 0 9 av 196 n 71 the specific capacities of wells of ai and aii tend to be higher in the coastal and northern inland areas along the yodo river among those of west osaka plain especially beneath the hilly areas while those do not change in the kawachi plain the specific capacities are higher in the area along the yodo river among wells of aiii and aiv geochemistry of groundwaters of the whole osaka plain were first documented by nakaya et al 2009 na ca hco3 type freshwater was abundant in the hilly area at the foot of surrounding mountains also the similar type of groundwaters appeared at the center of the plain in the aquifers 20 m depths from the surface of uemachi plateau the distribution of na ca hco3 type freshwater indicates the recharge of studied groundwaters in these hills and plateau na hco3 type freshwater was the most abundant in the unconfined and confined aquifers at the center of the plain beneath the holocene sediments indicating stagnant condition of these aquifers nakaya et al 2009 makino et al 2010 makino et al 2010 also documented the na cl type saline groundwaters distributing in the ai aquifer of the nishi osaka plain due to seawater invasion another type of na cl saline groundwaters were found from the aquifers iii and iv most of which were arima type brine ex shintani et al 2019 as will be discussed later 3 material and methods 3 1 groundwater samples and analytical methods groundwater samples were collected using electric pumps where the sampling has been undertaken after stabilization of the in situ measurements of physico chemical parameters water temperature ph electric conductivity oxidation reduction potential orp and dissolved oxygen do the sample waters were saved into plastic bottles after filtration for alkalinity and anion analyses and after filtration and acidification

or the next day of sampling and anion analysis was done in three days the samples for hydrogen and oxygen isotope analyses were filtered and saved in a glass vial concentrations of chloride and other anions f cl br no3 n po4 2 and so4 2 were analyzed by ion chromatography dx 120 thermo fisher scientific alkalinity as hco3 was ascertained by titration with 0 02 m hcl na and k concentrations were analyzed by atomic absorption spectrometry ca2 and mg2 concentrations by titration with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid solution and nh4 concentration by indophenol blue colorimetry although the full suite of major components was analyzed to check the accuracy of our major component analyses only the analytical results for most abundant dissolved ions cl alkalinity na and ca2 were used in this study li and b concentrations were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry spq 9700 hitachi high tech science the analyses of major and minor dissolved components were performed at osaka city university hydrogen and oxygen isotopic compositions δ2h and δ18o respectively were analyzed using wavelength scanned cavity ring down spectroscopy l2120i and l2130i analyzers picarro inc

jamstec 3 2 database of groundwater chemistry and geology a database of groundwater chemistry was established from the results of analytical studies of groundwaters within the osaka basin published since 2008 nakaya et al 2009 osaka prefecture 2008 2010 makino et al 2010 kobayashi et al 2013 shintani et al 2019 and new data obtained in this study the procedures of sampling and chemical and isotope analyses were described in each publication all these studies except the work by kobayashi et al 2013 were reported by our group for the data sets of our previous and present studies analytical procedures of dissolved chemical components were the same among those studies while the stable isotopes of waters δ2h and δ18o were analyzed by conventional mass spectrometry for co2 and h2 equilibrated with and or extracted from the water in the reports until 2010 we only selected groundwaters for which complete data were available location altitude of well bottom bottom depth of the well from sea level concentrations of cl alkalinity na and ca2 and δ18o and δ2h these four dissolved components and two isotopic compositions were selected because they can be applied to detect differences in sources and geochemical processes after recharging if more than two samples with complete information were available for the same well the recent data were chosen in total data for 476 samples were included in our dataset surface topography geology and active faults were drawn as 3 d maps using open data digital sources geologic maps showing 3 d visualizations see section 3 4 of marine clay layers ma9 and ma 1 and basement rocks were compiled using data from mitamura 2003 2007 and mitamura and hashimoto 2004 these data were enhanced by kriging of the depth distributions of the basal horizons of the two marine clay layers obtained from geological and geophysical field surveys and observations of drill cores and cuttings the resultant database was stored in geotiff format 3 3 cluster analysis in this study cluster analysis was performed using add in software bellcurve for excel v3 21 social surveying research information co ltd to subdivide the groundwaters of each aquifer into those with similar geochemical characteristics based on data for cl alkalinity na ca2 δ18o and δ2h these two anions two cations and stable isotopes of water can minimize the parameters enough to categorize the sources and reaction process in aquifers at permeable ca dominant and stagnant na dominant condition the cluster analysis was done for the data sets of the four aquifers euclidean distance among these components were calculated then the ward s method was applied to cluster the groundwater samples 3 4 mapping of geology and groundwater chemistry the open source gis geographic resources analysis support system grass was used to draw the 3 d maps produced in this study although grass is made up of modules that can be customized according to users particular needs carrera hernández and gaskin 2006 the 3 d geochemical maps produced herein were drawn using the standard unmodified modules of grass v6 4 2 the 50 m grid elevation data were input to grass to visualize the topographic surface the locations of marine clay layers and basement rocks were imported and rasterized in grass after converting depth to elevation the geochemical data and groundwater sampling locations were converted from world geodetic system 1984 wgs84 to universal transverse mercator utm coordinates and input as point data the 3 d hydrogeological maps were produced by combining the data with the 3 d visualization tool nviz in grass the 3 d topographic map covers an area of 5400 km2 total map area shown as red square 90 60 km in fig 1b whereas the holocene layers cover an area of 2072 km2 at the surface of the maps a combined map of topographic surfaces with elevations 100 m above sea level and the surface of basement rocks beneath the osaka plain was produced to represent the basin geometry water samples from deep wells in aquifers aii aiii and aiv were taken from multiple strainers well depth was used as the vertical coordinate for mapping the spatial distributions of the geochemical and isotopic data for example the total length of strainers for a deep well drilled for a hot spa was 150 m within each 300 m depth interval drilled thus the chemical characteristics of individual samples from each of those aquifers may reflect the characteristics of mixed groundwaters from multiple aquifers 4 results analytical results for groundwater samples obtained in this study and other previous studies are provided in the supplementary information materials for fresh groundwaters results are provided separately for each aquifer supplementary tables s1 s4 and as average values for groundwater clusters supplementary table s5 the results for saline groundwaters from all aquifers are listed in supplementary table s6 list of samples for analyzed δ7li and the references are in supplementary tables s7 and s8 4 1 mapping of topography geology and geochemistry the distributions of cl concentrations alkalinity and δ18o values of groundwater in aquifers ai to aiv were plotted on 3 d maps figs 3 5 the 3 d maps clearly show undulations in the geologic succession that increase with depth reflecting the uneven subsidence of the basin associated with repetitive fault movements in figs 3 5 ma9 in panel a ma 1 in b and basement in c and d in addition the major active faults bounding the basin are apparent as steep slopes in the basement rocks fault names are given in figs 1b surface map and 3c 3 d map the results of our geochemical mapping are described below 4 1 1 chloride concentrations in ai groundwater samples with cl concentrations 3 meq l were identified in the coastal area and inland areas along the yodo river where the altitude is below sea level areas within the red line in fig 3a cl concentrations 3 meq l were detected only in the shallow part of aii red line fig 3b overlapping the spatial extent of similar waters in ai therefore it is concluded that modern seawater that migrated along the yodo river and seawater that migrated along the uemachi faults during the last submergence have infiltrated through ai into aii a sample with 100 meq l cl was recovered from aii along the arima takatsuki fault groundwater with cl 30 meq l was identified in the lowermost part of aiii in the deepest part of the basin red line fig 3c some of these samples were collected along the slopes of the uemachi and uchihata faults groundwater samples from aiv occasionally showed cl concentrations 10 meq l red lines fig 3d these saline groundwaters were obtained along the arima takatsuki and uchihata faults and from the deepest part of the basin bottom along the uemachi fault 4 1 2 alkalinity groundwater samples with alkalinity 6 meq l in ai areas within the red line in fig 4a were identified in the same area as those with high cl concentrations 3 meq l because those high cl concentrations were a result of seawater contamination as noted above this high alkalinity was likely promoted by sulfate reduction associated with the decomposition of organic matter to release hco3 makino et al 2010 in aii groundwaters with alkalinity 6 meq l were identified mostly in samples from the foothills of the mountains and on the uemachi plateau which are likely groundwater recharge areas areas within the blue line in fig 4b groundwaters with alkalinity between 6 and 12 meq l areas with the red line fig 4b were identified in the deeper part of aii beneath the lowland of the osaka plain in the same region as groundwaters with δ18o 8 fig 5b see section 4 1 3 groundwaters with alkalinity between 3 and 6 meq l were identified in aiii along the foothills of the mountains as was the case for aii indicating that these aquifers are recharged by surface water alkalinity 6 meq l was abundantly identified in the deeper part of aiii and along the uchihata faults on the slope of izumi mountains area within red line fig 4c groundwaters from aiv with alkalinity between 6 and 12 meq l occur along the uemachi faults northern slope of izumi mountains fig 4d and those with alkalinity 10 meq l along the arima takatsuki including arima and uchihata faults including ishobotoke areas within red lines fig 4d both of these areas overlap regions where high cl concentrations were identified in aiii and aiv 4 1 3 oxygen isotopes groundwaters from ai showed limited δ18o variations with values mostly between 8 0 and 6 0 except for some samples from near the coast where higher δ18o values are likely associated with seawater infiltration areas within the red line in fig 5a the range of δ18o values for groundwaters from aii was similar to that for ai fig 5b it is notable that δ18o values below 8 0 were obtained from samples from deeper parts of aii red line fig 5b the δ18o values of aiii groundwaters collected from the hills at the edge of the basin blue line fig 5c were 8 0 to 6 0 similar to those from ai and the shallow part of aii indicating that the hilly area corresponds to the recharge area groundwater with δ18o 8 0 mainly occurred in the center of the basin especially in the deeper part of aiii and these groundwaters seemed to be isolated from the shallower part of this aquifer most of the aiv groundwaters from the mountain area showed δ18o values between 7 0 and 6 0 within the range of local meteoric water there fig 5d whereas those with δ18o values 6 0 were identified in the basement rocks of the mountains south and north of the basin ishibotoke and the surrounding area and arima in fig 3d and the center of the basin purple line fig 3d 4 2 cluster analysis results of the cluster analysis are reported in supplementary tables in which the data are summarized according to the clusters in each aquifer for convenience the clustered dataset was separated into freshwaters cl 3 meq l tables s1 s4 and saline waters cl 3 meq l table s6 and the average compositions of each clustered freshwater group are provided in supplementary table s5 the clustered groundwater groups were confirmed the correspondence among those of the four aquifers according to the geochemistry the relations between δ18o and δ2h and between δ18o and alkalinity of fresh groundwaters cl 3 meq l for aquifers ai to aiv are plotted in figs 6 and 7 most fresh groundwaters fall within the range of the modern local meteoric water however the cluster analysis separated the groundwater samples in each aquifer into two to four groups with different isotopic ranges and alkalinities in particular highly elevated alkalinity with low δ18o values were observed for the groundwaters in aiv on the basis of these relations the freshwater samples can be categorized into two groups one with low alkalinity and rather high stable isotopic ranges fw1 open symbols in figs 6 and 7 and the other with high alkalinity and lower stable isotopic ranges fw2 closed symbols in figs 6 and 7 although cluster analysis is suitable for screening samples some exceptional samples are included in each cluster in this study saline waters are occasionally difficult to separate into groups with distinctive geochemical characteristics for example in the δ18o vs δ2h plot fig 8a there are two obvious trends for the saline waters cl 40 meq l from aiii and aiv some samples plot along the mixing line between seawater and local meteoric water mlsw mixing line with seawater whereas others plot on a different trend pink line labeled arima type brine the data points that plot away from the mixing line can be separated into two additional different groups as described below the relation between cl concentration and δ2h demonstrates that groundwater samples clearly show differences among clusters of saline waters fig 8b the samples from ai and aii except one sample from aii plot along the mixing trend between local meteoric water and seawater light blue triangle fig 8b however most saline waters of aiii plot below this mixing area on or below the mixing line between arima type brine and modern local meteoric water pink line fig 8b this result indicates that the saline waters in aiii and aiv are diluted with not only modern local meteoric water but also another freshwater having low δ2h and δ18o values to separate the two or more saline waters originated different sources relation between δ18o and δ2h relations among cl b li and δ7li were used as described in the following section 4 3 cl b li systematics and δ7li li and b can be used as indicators of the high temperature history of groundwater especially in deep aquifers because li and b are released into solution by reactions between pore fluid and rocks sediments at temperatures 100 c for li and 50 c for b and subsequently remain in solution as the temperature decreases you et al 1996 james et al 2003 clay minerals adsorb b at temperatures below 40 c palmer et al 1987 and b is released into porewater through desorption from clay minerals and or illitization of smectite hüpers and kopf 2012 thus it is plausible that b was released into the groundwater via reaction with marine clay minerals in the basin at temperatures near or above 40 c covariations of cl b li concentrations are known to indicate the origin of saline waters e g osawa et al 2010 the relation among those components is shown for groundwaters with cl 1 meq l fig 9 the dataset used for drawing this figure is summarized in supplementary table s7 most data points fall within the area of groundwater affected by modern fossil seawater in the host sediments and or formation water that has reacted with clay rich sediments light blue shaded area highly saline waters tend to plot near seawater and diluted ones close to the b end member thus these groundwaters have been affected by seawater infiltration or interactions with clay minerals in the host sediment but have not experienced high temperature conditions that would have released considerable amounts of li one sample of aii one sample of aiii and some aiv saline waters fall beyond this area and some plot on the typical arima type brine red circle indicated with atb known to have experienced high temperature reactions 280 c e g masuda et al 1986 the δ7li values of groundwaters from aiii and aiv range from 1 7 to 14 fig 10 considerably lower than the δ7li value of modern seawater 31 e g chan and edmond 1988 misra and froelich 2009 most groundwater samples with 1 mg l li had δ7li values of 9 to 14 suggesting that these values are the range of background δ7li values for groundwater that has reacted with host sediments in the osaka plain or basement sedimentary rocks values of δ7li lower than this background range e g 1 7 at arima spa and 4 0 at ishibotoke appeared only in the mountains and along active perimeter faults fig 10b groundwaters with high alkalinity and slightly low δ7li values relative to the most beneath the plain occur in the izumi mountains pink shaded area labeled deep co2 added water in fig 10a this distribution of low δ7li values and high alkalinity implies that hydrothermal fluids upwell along these faults discussed in section 5 3 5 discussion the studied groundwaters were categorized on the basis of our cluster analysis and additional information on δ18o δ2h cl b li systematics and δ7li see flow chart in fig 11 five end members can be discriminated for the osaka plain groundwater of which two are freshwater and three are saline water 5 1 freshwaters fw1 and fw2 fresh groundwaters with rather high δ2h and δ18o values and low alkalinity abbreviated fw1 which originated from local meteoric water occur down to 100 m depth beneath the plain and 300 m depth in the hill and mountain areas this water type can also be found below 300 m depth from the surface along the uemachi and uchihata faults figs 12a 1 b 1 the dominant chemistry of this water is ca hco3 type suggesting active groundwater flow na hco3 type groundwaters were found in the ai aquifer beneath the lowland part of the plain indicating stagnant flow conditions the δ18o and δ2h values of fw1 groundwaters range from 5 5 to 8 and 40 to 55 respectively freshwaters with relatively low δ2h and δ18o values and relatively higher alkalinity than fw1 abbreviated fw2 occur widely in the deeper part of the plain figs 12a 2 b 2 fw2 is dominated by na hco3 type freshwater fw2 groundwaters did not originate from modern meteoric water because fw2 is isolated from the recharge areas of waters with comparable isotopic characteristics i e the surrounding mountains fig 5 the δ2h and δ18o values of fw2 decrease from aii through aiii to aiv implying the occurrence of some process that promotes isotopic fractionation in fw2 depletion of δ18o and δ2h in fresh groundwater relative to local meteoric water as observed in fw2 would be explained by the recharge of originally low δ18o and δ2h precipitation groundwater in coastal basins is generally categorized into four groups on the basis of recharge age modern groundwater pre industrial water 10 000 200 a late pleistocene groundwater 20 10 ka and water from older formations which occasionally exhibits high salinity edmunds 2001 ikawa et al 2014a groundwaters that originated from precipitation and melting of ice after the last glaciation had low δ18o values edmunds 2001 such groundwaters have been found in japan at depths 300 m for example at horonobe in hokkaido and beneath the kanto plain ikawa et al 2014b yasuhara et al 2008 2011 as noted above fossil seawater probably recharged during the latest submergence is known to exist in the aquifers above ma6 as categorized ai and aii in this study beneath the kawachi plain eastern osaka plain tsurumaki 1972 morikawa et al 2014 the residence time of groundwater at depths of up to 1500 m in the deepest part of the osaka plain at kobe city in the northeastern edge of the basin has been estimated to be 25 230 kyr morikawa et al 2005 pre dating the peak of the last glacial maximum thus it is plausible that the fw2 recharged during the early to middle pleistocene still remains in the aii aquifers beneath the ma6 marine clay layer the residence time of fresh groundwaters in aiii and aiv would have a similar or longer temporal range the timing of recharge cannot be determined in this study for most of the aquifers in the osaka plain especially those recharged in pre industrial times owing to a lack of age data however the recharging period of fw2 might become older with increasing depth from the last glacial period the previous study explained the depletion of δ18o and δ2h by diagenetic alteration processes i e ultrafiltration during passage through thick sedimentary sequences shintani et al 2019 when the ultrafiltration occurs depletion rates in δ2h by 2 5 and in δ18o by 0 8 ca 3 1 coplen and hanshaw 1973 some of the freshwaters may be experienced this process because the δ18o and δ2h were plotted on the trend of such depletion indicated as arrows in figs 6c and 6d however large analytical error of δ2h cannot be eliminated since a few waters from aiii and aiv taken from the same sampling period gave higher d values than the range of local meteoric waters plots out of light blue shaded areas in figs 6c and 6d most of the freshwaters of fw2 of aiii and aiv are plotted on the gmwl thus it is plausible that the precipitation before the last submergence was the source of fw2 waters and the effect of ultrafiltration would be limited 5 2 saline waters saline waters are categorized into three groups two seawater influenced waters sw1 and sw2 and deep seated water sw1 is identified as seawater contaminated groundwater diluted with fw1 dark blue points in fig 13a reversals in the flow of seawater in the ai aquifer take place as a result of tidal changes at sea level especially in the yodo river system in the western part of the lowland nishi osaka plain see figs 1 3 makino et al 2010 seawater has run up to the eastern border of the basin along the yodo river since 1964 when a weir ozeki was built to control the water flow of the yodo river thus the seawater of sw1 is modern seawater that has infiltrated the western part of the plain whereas slightly older pre 1964 seawater may have influenced the inland area as noted above fossil seawater has previously been identified in aquifers above the ma6 clay layer of the kawachi plain the lowland east of the uemachi plateau e g tsurumaki 1972 and has been reported to have been recharged during the last holocene transgression 7 5 ka morikawa et al 2014 in aii the old seawater recharged during the last submergence would be included especially in the inland aquifers another type of saline water containing a seawater component is present in aiii and aiv sw2 light blue points in fig 13a in the cl b li diagram the sw2 samples plot in the mixing area between seawater and the b enriched endmember light blue shaded area in fig 9 and the δ7li values indicate reaction with host sediments or rocks as noted in section 4 4 this type of saline water occurs at the bottom of the basin even in the inland area away from the yodo river fig 13a thus the source of salinity of sw2 cannot be modern seawater although the timing of recharge of the seawater of sw2 is unclear the seawater will be fossil rather than modern seawater plots of cl vs δ2h of sw2 align on the area of seawater diluted with 2h depleted freshwater the area roughly indicated with blue ellipse in fig 8 b thus the other end member of sw2 would mostly likely be fw2 arima type brine atb have experienced high temperatures in this study atb red points in fig 13 was identified among the saline groundwaters that had undergone high temperature reactions evidenced by high li cl ratios and low δ7li values 5 figs 9 10 groundwaters in the same cluster which have δ18o δ2h and cl b li values similar to those of atb were also categorized as atb the atb waters includes another cluster defined as atb 2 which are atbs diluted with low δ18o and δ2h freshwater orange points in fig 13 two saline groundwaters fab green points in fig 13 which exhibit δ18o and δ2h isotopic compositions similar to those of atb but low concentrations of b and li were found in the same area as sw2 implying a relation between fossil seawater and arima type brine arima type brine is named for the saline groundwaters found at arima and the surrounding area this brine is characterized by a heavy oxygen isotopic shift away from local meteoric water e g matsubaya et al 1973 sakai and matsubaya 1977 masuda et al 1986 and is known to contain mantle derived components such as he with high 3h 4he ratios e g nagao et al 1981 sano and wakita 1985 in addition the brines are characterized by very high li cl and li na ratios compared to seawater e g takamatsu et al 1986 kazahaya et al 2014 the origin of arima type brine has recently been attributed to dehydration of the subducting slab of the philippine sea plate e g kazahaya et al 2014 kusuda et al 2014 our mapping clearly shows that the arima type brine occurs around the rim of the basin including the foothills of the mountains and the fault slopes it is also possible that fossil seawater that infiltrated along faults into basement rocks and underwent high temperature water rock interactions might be a source of arima type brine 5 3 emanation of co2 from depth arima type brine commonly contains high amounts of free co2 and high alkalinity even when the temperature is low saline groundwaters with 10 meq l alkalinity appear only along active fault systems such as the arima takatsuki uemachi and uchihata faults fig 13b the locations of the high alkalinity saline groundwaters mostly overlap with those of arima type brine in particular it is notable that saline groundwaters in the southern mountains occasionally have high alkalinity similar brines discharge along the mtl in japan tanaka et al 2013 kazahaya et al 2014 kusuda et al 2014 and the discharge of this water at ishibotoke has been attributed to its proximity to a fault e g matsubaya et al 1973 morikawa et al 2016 found high alkalinity in groundwaters sampled along the mtl on the southern slope of the izumi mountains and suggested that phase separation during upwelling of deep seated fluids along the faults released co2 which dissolved in the surrounding groundwater co2 gas released by this mechanism must be upwelling over much of this mountainous area and becoming dissolved in local groundwater between the mtl and the divergent uchihata faults fresh groundwaters with high alkalinity recovered from the izumi mountains yielded δ7li values of 2 9 9 4 which are within the ranges of atb and waters known to have incorporated deep co2 fig 10a in particular δ7li values 7 5 suggest that the co2 dissolved in arima type brine is separated and trapped in the fresh groundwaters in this area although the samples of fw2 from aiv contained no co2 gas they characteristically had high alkalinity in the southern part of the plain along the trend of the uemachi faults morikawa et al 2008 identified mantle derived he trapped in aquifers in the lowermost osaka plain sediments beneath the nishi osaka plain thus mantle derived co2 may move through the uemachi faults and become dissolved in the deepest groundwater to form hco3 6 conclusions three dimensional mapping demonstrated the presence of groundwater masses derived from different sources 1 local meteoric water i e precipitation and river water 2 freshwater that is inferred to be recharged before last glacial period and have been diagenetically altered 3 seawater with a wide range of recharge ages and 4 deep seated brine identified as arima type brine these groundwater masses are spatially separated in the aquifer basin it is clear that 3 d mapping is more useful in tracing the spatial distribution especially the vertical variation and constraints of geologic structure of different types of groundwater than conventional 2 d mapping both fresh and saline groundwaters from aquifers in the osaka plain are being used for domestic and industrial purposes mainly from aii and for commercial spas mainly from aiii and aiv however the results of 3 d geochemical mapping show that there are limits to the sustainable exploitation of these resources because actively flowing groundwater occurs only in the shallow part of the plain attention should be paid to the utilization of groundwater from the deep aquifers the 3 d maps produced here are a first step in providing the information necessary to sustainably manage groundwater resources in the osaka plain the 3 d maps also provide information on the relationships of deep groundwater to active tectonics e g subduction and dehydration of the philippine sea plate convection in the mantle wedge and inland fault activity and thus provide important data to improve our understanding of the water cycle at convergent plate margins method presented in this study for visualizing groundwater masses derived from different sources drawing 3 d mapping combined with cluster analysis of groundwater geochemistry is applicable to design mitigation plan of basin scale groundwater resource management especially for the urbanized coastal plains of asian countries where

7879,study region mu us sandy land china study focus the groundwater table in unconfined aquifers is often a subdued replica of the topography or land surface in hilly terrain spatial interpolation methods are prone to errors such as higher interpolation water level than the ground surface due to sparse observation wells meanwhile in ridge areas groundwater depth can easily be overestimated with limited groundwater observations to address these issues this paper proposes a framework to learn groundwater depth using related groundwater variables based on the extreme gradient boosting xgb machine learning method moreover the groundwater level map is drawn based on the predicted groundwater depths and elevation data new hydrological insights for the region the results obtained by the xgb algorithm are compared with those of common interpolation methods including inverse distance weighting ordinary kriging and collaborative ordinary kriging and machine learning methods including multiple linear regression geographically weighted regression support vector regression and random forest the results showed that the xgb using the tweedie loss function performs best in learning groundwater depth compared with interpolation methods and other machine learning methods and almost completely overcomes the effects of imbalanced data the topographic factors such as elevation topographic position index and topographic roughness index are key factors for groundwater depth this study provides a reference for improving regional gl mapping especially in areas of complex terrain graphical abstract ga1 keywords groundwater level mapping groundwater depth extreme gradient boosting imbalanced distribution data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction groundwater plays a critical role in water resources especially in arid areas evans et al 2020 varouchakis et al 2022 unlike surface water groundwater below the surface of the earth cannot be directly observed malekzadeh et al 2019 groundwater level gl is highly nonlinear and complex due to the influence of topography meteorology geomorphology hydrology geology and human activities ao et al 2021 drilling wells is a common approach to monitoring the gl and gl mapping is primarily based on these observed gl data sun et al 2009 fischer et al 2021 gl mapping is an important task for groundwater resource management the interpolation methods and physical process based models are the main methods to obtain groundwater flow fields through gl data from wells malekzadeh et al 2019 ao et al 2021 interpolation methods such as inverse distance weighting idw and kriging are widely used in geology and hydrology zhu et al 2017 zhou et al 2019 fischer et al 2021 these methods mainly consider the spatial correlation of interpolation points caruso and quarta 1998 and they are often applied to spatial interpolation of gl sun et al 2009 evans et al 2020 unfortunately for a large scale study area with hilly terrain and limited drilling data gl mapping by these interpolation methods will suffer from serious errors hoeksema et al 1989 ohmer et al 2017 collaborative kriging considers spatial stationarity and adds covariates to estimate the target parameter which can reduce some of the errors ahmadi and sedghamiz 2008 sadat noori et al 2013 however it cannot handle the interpolation of gl effectively desbarats et al 2002 guekie simo et al 2016 most physical models such as modflow and hydrus are developed based on the principle of water balance and the consideration of the hydrodynamic process of groundwater twarakavi et al 2008 han et al 2015 niswonger 2020 compared with mathematical statistics methods such as geostatistical interpolation physical models generally have higher estimation accuracy and better reliability malekzadeh et al 2019 miro et al 2021 however they usually require many spatiotemporal data as input and a variety of physical parameters for calibration and the uncertainty of inputs and parameters poses great challenges to the calibration and validation of numerical models malekzadeh et al 2019 also physical models often consume a lot of time for the simulation process thus it has been argued that groundwater numerical simulation is mainly applicable to small scale regions due to limited inputs aliyari et al 2019 some machine learning ml methods with good simulation effects have been widely used and are one of the current research hotspots shen 2018 reichstein et al 2019 ma et al 2021 at present ml methods have been applied to groundwater related research such as groundwater potential mapping moghaddam et al 2020 choubin and rahmati 2021 kumar et al 2021 and dynamic simulation of gl malekzadeh et al 2019 ao et al 2021 miro et al 2021 martínez santos et al 2021a 2021b adopted ml methods to map groundwater dependent ecosystems generally the application of ml methods is limited by three points the algorithm itself the selection of feature variables and the acquisition of samples zhang and ma 2012 cracknell and reading 2014 rao et al 2018 achieng 2019 feng et al 2021 due to these limitations few studies have realized large scale gl mapping using ml methods lendzioch et al 2021 with the development of methodologies and algorithms several ml methods have been proved to be efficient for regression problems taking the random forest rf algorithm as an example it has been shown that the rf algorithm is an excellent classifier or regressor because of its robustness and efficiency pal 2005 clark et al 2010 sun et al 2020 zi chen et al 2021 however similar to other ml algorithms the rf algorithm does not perform well when learning from extremely imbalanced training data lin et al 2021 recently the extreme gradient boosting xgb algorithm has received much attention in many fields chen and guestrin 2016 similar to the rf algorithm xgb is also a tree ensemble algorithm the main difference is that the rf algorithm is based on bagging creating individual learners independently while the xgb algorithm uses boosting creating individual learners with strong correlations and generates the learners sequentially zhou 2021 because boosting algorithms are iterative algorithms that place different weights on the training distribution in each iteration it can improve the regression or classification performance for rare classes and extreme values weiss 2004 many studies have shown that the xgb algorithm achieves better efficiency and accuracy than the rf algorithm barzegar et al 2021 kiangala and wang 2021 shi et al 2021 loss function plays an important role in improving the performance of some ml algorithms wang et al 2022 also a reasonable loss function can increase the robustness of the algorithm gul et al 2021 the xgb algorithm provides multiple loss functions for regression and classification e g linear and logistic loss functions and these loss functions can be customized chen and guestrin 2016 hyper parameters affect the robustness and simulation accuracy of some ml algorithms mangasarian and musicant 2000 barzegar et al 2018 miro et al 2021 grid search based approaches are commonly used for tuning hyper parameters gul et al 2021 however grid search does not guarantee to find the optimal solution and is extremely computationally expensive because it uses the exhaust method to adjust parameters khan et al 2020 qin et al 2021 the bayesian approach is a good choice for optimizing the hyper parameters of algorithms brochu et al 2010 sun et al 2020 2021 compared to grid search it refers to previous evaluations for the next round of hyper parameters optimization thus reducing computational overhead klein et al 2017 this study takes the mu us sandy land an arid area with complex terrain as the research object first a groundwater related geospatial database at a spatial resolution of 250 m is constructed including elevation average annual precipitation lithology etc then according to the database multiple ml methods including multiple linear regression mlr support vector regression svr geographically weighted regression gwr rf and xgb are used to learn the groundwater depth in unconfined aquifers with the data of hundreds of wells the hyper parameters are tuned using the bayesian optimization algorithm finally the gl maps are drawn based on the predicted groundwater depth gd and elevation data 2 materials and methodology 2 1 study area the study area is located in the southeast of ordos inner mongolia china which belongs to the mu us sandy land and occupies an area of 20 703 km2 e 107 49 109 57 n 37 39 39 43 fig 1 it belongs to a semi arid area and the annual precipitation is generally between 300 and 500 mm groundwater is a key source of water for agricultural irrigation industrial processes mining and drinking water in the study area zhang and wang 2020 the terrain of the study area is complex including mountains plateaus foothills basins and plains the overall topography gradually decreases from northwest to southeast there are also some inner flow zones and lakes in the study area fig 1 due to the uneven terrain the unconfined gl vary widely in space which means that groundwater resources are unevenly distributed in the study area a quaternary loose layer pore aquifer formed a unified water bearing system with the cretaceous fissure pore unconfined aquifers the unconfined aquifer is very thick and the maximum thickness is more than 1000 m wang et al 2017 the unconfined groundwater receives recharge at the aquifer outcropping area and flows to rivers or lakes guangcai et al 2010 2 2 materials fig 2 shows the overall research framework of this study it mainly includes construction of the groundwater related geospatial database filtering of explanatory variables selection and preprocessing of training test samples construction and comparison of regression models and gl mapping 2 2 1 groundwater data in recent years a certain number of groundwater observation wells have been constructed in the study area this study obtained the daily observed gl and gd of 178 wells from 2018 to 2020 meanwhile the groundwater depth of some drilling points was obtained from local government departments from 2015 to 2020 a total of 332 sample points were collected in this study and their locations are shown in fig 1 since most of the groundwater data at the drilling point are taken in summer to exclude the influence of seasonal fluctuations on gl this study used the average gl during the vegetation growing season from may to september to represent the water level of the wells with long term observations fig 3 shows the numerical distribution of gd at all points with a mean of 8 86 m and a standard deviation of 11 84 m the distribution of gd is very imbalanced where large values have fewer observations only three points have a gd exceeding 50 m and they are distributed at 50 60 m 60 70 m and 70 80 m respectively due to limited data 80 of the samples were selected as training sets in this study and the other 20 were used for testing fig 1 2 2 2 groundwater related variables some explanatory variables related to groundwater were selected in this study and they were divided into five types table 1 the geospatial database is constructed based on these variables 1 precipitation precipitation data were obtained from the china meteorological data service centre http data cma cn and local government departments a total of 15 weather stations near the study area were involved in this study fig 1 the average annual precipitation data from 2018 to 2020 were calculated further the idw method was employed to obtain average annual precipitation raster data at a resolution of 250 m the average annual precipitation in the study area gradually decreases from southwest to northeast fig 4 a 2 topographical factors several topographical factors significantly affect groundwater availability elevation slope aspect topographic position index tpi topographic roughness index tri flow accumulation fa and topographic wetness index twi were selected in this study the cumulative recharge of groundwater decreases with the increase of elevation the slope affects surface and subsurface flow velocity and infiltration process the aspect reflects the flow direction of grids tpi and tri reflect the elevation relationship between adjacent grids and characterize the storage capacity of water kumar et al 2021 tpi and tri are calculated as follows 1 tpi z 0 1 n i 1 n z i 2 tri 1 n i 1 n z 0 z i 2 where z 0 represents the elevation of the center point z i represents the elevation within the neighborhood grids and n is the number of selected neighborhood grids the value of tpi and tri will change with the focus window size to select a reasonable focus window size this study calculated the tpi and tri value under eight different window sizes 3 3 5 5 7 7 9 9 13 13 15 15 and 17 17 tpi3 represents the tpi value with a window size of 3 3 twi can reflect the water storage capacity of the corresponding grid and its calculation formula is 3 twi ln a s tan β where a s is accumulated area upstream of the grid and β is the slope srtm dem data with a resolution of 90 m were used to obtain the elevation data table 1 https srtm csi cgiar org srtmdata which was resampled into 250 m raster data in this study fig 4 b slope aspect flow accumulation fa tpi tri and twi were calculated based on the dem data fig 4 c h 3 vegetation index products common vegetation indices include ndvi and evi this study obtained the vegetation index data from the mod13q1 product to make the results more reliable the average ndvi and evi were calculated for the 2018 2020 growing season from may to september meanwhile according to the calculated average ndvi the fractional vegetation cover fvc desbarats et al 2002 was calculated and the calculation formula is as follows 4 fvc ndvi ndvi soil ndvi veg ndvi soil where ndvi soil is the ndvi value of the bare soil area and ndvi veg is the ndvi value of the pixel completely covered by vegetation in this study the ndvi values of the 99th and 1st percentile were selected as the ndvi value of pure vegetation and bare soil respectively fig 4 i k shows the evi ndvi and fvc in the study area 4 soil data several soil factors have a certain influence on the replenishment and consumption of groundwater such as the soil bulk density bd and soil structure ss data this study obtained bd and ss data from national tibetan plateau data center http westdc westgis ac cn shangguan et al 2012 the data has a resolution of 1 km and it was resampled to a resolution of 250 m in this study fig 4 l m 5 other auxiliary data in addition to the above mentioned factors several other factors also affect the groundwater table such as lithology and land cover the lithology data was obtained from the national 1 1000 0000 geological map fig 4 p considering the recharge and discharge of groundwater by rivers and lakes this study also calculated two indexes distance to rivers distoriver and distance to lakes distolake the data of river and lake systems were obtained from a 1 1000 000 national basic geographic dataset fig 4 n o in addition land cover data were obtained from the european aviation agency https viewer esa worldcover org worldcover the data mainly consists of ten types and the study area covers eight of them fig 4 q 2 3 methods 2 3 1 pairwise correlation method pairwise correlation is a non parametric statistics method developed for the discrimination of features gere et al 2015 it can be used to evaluate collinearity between variables dormann et al 2013 pairwise correlation is often calculated using the linear correlation coefficient r for a pair of variables x y r is given by the following formula 5 r i x i x i y i y i i x i x i 2 i y i y i 2 where x i is the mean of x and y i is the mean of y the r value between 1 and 1 represents the correlation between x and y r 0 indicates a positive correlation r 0 indicates a negative correlation and r 0 indicates no correlation at all according to the study of dormann et al 2013 when the correlation coefficient r is greater than 0 7 or less than 0 7 it is considered that there is high collinearity between explanatory variables 2 3 2 interpolation methods statistical interpolation methods such as idw and kriging are commonly used to interpolate the groundwater table sadat noori et al 2013 in the idw method the reciprocal of the distance is used as a weight and the interpolated value of the sampling point is calculated 6 z i 1 n 1 d i q z i i 1 n 1 d i q where z i is the value of the adjacent sampling point i i 1 2 n d i is the distance between the interpolated point and the adjacent sampling point q is a constant and it usually takes a value of 2 the kriging method aims to establish the best linear unbiased estimator based on the available data of regionalized variables and structural features of a variogram hoeksema et al 1989 ordinary kriging ok is one of the most common kriging methods and it can be expressed as 7 z ˆ x p i 1 n λ i z x i where z ˆ x p is the interpolated value at location x p z i is the value of the adjacent sampling point x i i 1 2 n λ i is the weight of z x i calculated by variogram models collaborative kriging introduces other related variables to improve the kriging ahmadi and sedghamiz 2008 its general form is 8 l 1 v i 1 n λ il γ lv x i x j μ v γ lv x i x j i 1 n λ il 1 1 u 0 1 u where u and v are the primary and covariate variables respectively γ x i x j is the value of the variogram corresponding to a vector with origin in x i and extremity in x j the elevation is a key factor that affects gl this study adopted the coordinative ordinary kriging cok method and introduced elevation as a covariate to interpolate the gl 2 3 3 machine learning methods several popular and promising ml methods were selected in this study including mlr svr gwr rf and xgb support vector machine svm is based on the statistical learning theory and can represent nonlinear relationships well gul et al 2021 it converts the nonlinear space into a high dimensional linear space through a nonlinear function and then finds the optimal linear interface in the new space mangasarian and musicant 2000 because of its simple structure good generalization ability and fast learning speed svm is one of the most commonly used classifiers or regressors barzegar et al 2018 wang et al 2019 miro et al 2021 when used for regression it is also called svr gwr considers the spatial non stationary of variables in different locations fischer and getis 2010 it introduces spatial regression coefficients based on ordinary linear regression to overcome spatial heterogeneity as much as possible jiang et al 2017 9 y i β i 0 k 1 k β ik x ik ε i where x ik is the independent variable y i is the dependent variable in location i β ik is the spatial regression coefficient of explanatory variables and ε i is the residual the ensemble learning method trains multiple base learners and combines their predictions into a reliable output in this way it makes the simulated result more reasonable and has a stronger generalization ability zhang and ma 2012 the rf algorithm is a bagging type ensemble of multiple decision trees mohana et al 2021 compared with a single decision tree the rf algorithm can improve the simulation accuracy with greater probability belgiu and drăguţ 2016 however due to training many trees on the random subset and adopting the mean of a result set of various trees as the final output the rf algorithm is biased to the data with various categorical variables anon 2021 different from the rf algorithm the xgb algorithm is a boosting type ensemble of multiple cart decision trees chen and guestrin 2016 the predicted result of the boosting type tree ensemble model can be expressed as 10 y i ˆ x i k 1 k f k x i f k f where f is the space of the regression tree k is the total number of trees indicating that the model uses k additive functions f k x i is the weighted score of the k th tree on i th input data x i xgb adopts a regularized learning objective to optimize the simulation results 11 obj i 1 n l y i y i ˆ k 1 k ω f k where l is the loss function n is the total number of the input ω is the regularization term to reduce the model complexity and prevent overfitting the loss function has a great influence on the final simulation results xgb provides several loss functions for regression such as squared error squared log error logistic gamma and tweedie and the squared error is the default in practical applications the selection of loss function should be according to the distribution characteristics of predicted variables therefore xgb allows users to customize the loss function for shallow groundwater in unconfined aquifers its gl should not exceed the ground elevation i e gd is not less than 0 m several loss functions such as gamma logistic and tweedie can satisfy this requirement in this study these loss functions were all selected to build xgb based regression models xgbg xgbl and xgbt in order to meet the requirement that gd is not less than 0 m we use gd as a predictor to construct the regression model using ml methods several gd related factors including precipitation topography vegetation soil and other were used as explanatory variables then the corresponding gl can be calculated as gd f precipitation topography vegetation soil other gl elevation gd 12 where f represents the regression function of the ml method mlr gwr svr rf xgbg xgbl and xgbt 2 3 4 bayesian optimization algorithm to reduce the errors as much as possible and prevent overfitting this study optimized the hyper parameters of the ml algorithms specifically the bayesian approach was adopted to optimize the hyper parameters the bayesian optimization algorithm builds a probabilistic model based on the evaluation results of the black box function to minimize the objective function jones et al 1998 it has the advantages of short time consumption and strong robustness sun et al 2020 the bayesian optimization algorithm mainly contains two major arguments one argument is a prior over function which expresses assumptions about the function under optimization the gaussian process is random and its prior is commonly used because of its flexibility and analytic tractability klein et al 2017 the optimized black box objective function in the gaussian process can be expressed 13 f x gp e x k x x where x represents the hyperparameter to be optimized e x represents a mean function and k x x represents a covariance function the other argument is an acquisition function used to construct a utility function from the model posterior three common acquisition functions can be selected upper confidence bound ucb probability of improvement pi and expected improvement ei brochu et al 2010 the ucb acquisition function can be calculated as 14 a ucb x μ x β σ x where β is a trade off parameter representing the upper confidence boundary μ x is the expected value and σ x is the standard deviation value the pi acquisition function can be expressed as a pi x φ γ x where 15 γ x μ x f x σ x where f x represents the existing maximum value and φ is the cumulative distribution function the ei acquisition function can be calculated as 16 a pi x σ x φ x μ x f x φ γ x σ 0 0 σ 0 where f x represents the existing maximum value φ and φ x represent the cumulative distribution function and the probability density function of the standard normal distribution respectively in addition the objective function needs to be determined in this study the 5 fold cross validation cv accuracy was taken as the optimization objective 2 3 5 evaluation index the performances of these models in gd were evaluated using four statistical indicators including correlation coefficient r root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae the formula of the correlation coefficient refers to eq 5 rmse and mae are calculated as 17 rmse 1 n gd o gd s 2 18 mae 1 n i 1 n gd o gd s where gd o and gd s are the observed and simulated groundwater depths respectively cov represents the covariance function var is the variance and n is the number of train or test samples higher values of r closer to 1 and lower values of rmse and mae closer to 0 indicate good prediction accuracy of regression models 3 results 3 1 filtering of explanatory variables feature collinearity is evaluated through pairwise correlations between variables fig 5 shows the correlation matrix of variables some variables are highly correlated with a correlation coefficient greater than 0 7 to avoid the collinearity problem this study chose one of the collinearity variables based on their correlation coefficient with gd thus the fvc was selected instead of evi and ndvi rgd evi 0 02 rgd ndvi 0 07 and rgd fvc 0 08 correlation coefficients of tpi or tri and gd at different focus window sizes are shown fig s1 it can be seen that as the focus window size increases rgd tri gradually increases but the increment rate decreases when the focus window size reaches 17 17 the correlation coefficient hardly increases meanwhile rgd tpi increases first and then decreases and the maximum value is obtained under the 13 13 window size thus the tri with a window size of 17 17 and the tpi with a window size of 13 13 were chosen as explanatory variables notably there is a high correlation between slope and tri but when the focus window size of tpi is 17 17 the correlation coefficient between slope and tri is less than 0 7 rslope tri 0 68 in addition the direct correlation coefficient between other explanatory variables ranges between 0 7 and 0 7 in all cases finally 17 explanatory variables were selected for the regression model fig 2 3 2 validation and comparison of all methods in this study some key hyperparameters of the svm rf and xgb model were optimized using the bayesian approach the optimized values are presented in table 2 the corresponding regression models were constructed according to the optimization results of the above hyper parameters table 3 shows the evaluation accuracy of traditional interpolation and ml methods it can be observed that the traditional interpolation methods including idw ok and cok have low accuracy in gl interpolation with large rmse larger than 6 m and mae between 3 and 7 m and low correlation coefficients lower than 0 8 on the test set the simulation effects of ml methods show significant differences mlr and gwr are less effective their rmses on the training set are about 7 m and the rmses on the test set are more than 3 m the rs are around 0 8 on both training and test sets the maes on the training set are more than 4 m and the maes on the test set are more than 2 m as for svr and rf their rs are greater than 0 9 on the training set and greater than 0 8 on the test set their rmses are between 2 and 3 m on the training set and are about 3 m on the test set xgbg xgbl and xgbt all have good regression accuracy their rs are close to 1 on the training set and close to 0 9 on the test set their rmses are close to 0 m on the training set and less than 3 m on the test set their maes are close to 0 m on the training set and less than 2 m on the test set according to these evaluation results on the training set and test set the performance of the ml methods is ordered as mlr gwr svr rf xgbl xgbg xgbt to further investigate the impact of imbalanced data on the model performance the simulation results of all the ml methods on the training set and test set were compared fig 6 on the training set the simulation results of xgbg and xgbt are excellent and the problem of imbalanced data is almost eliminated xgbl also achieves good results but there are some small deviations between observed and simulated gd svr also shows large gd values as well and there are significant overestimates and underestimates when gd is less than 30 m rf underestimates large gd values and overestimates small gd values fig 6 a and c it means that the rf algorithm is not effective in dealing with imbalanced data the results of mlr and gwr are unreliable for gd prediction compared to the training set the test set separates the three xgb models on the test set the results of xgbl deviate more from the observed values than xgbg and xgbt and rf performs better than svr the result is consistent with that shown in table 3 3 3 groundwater level mapping this gd map is presented in fig s2 the gd map drawn by the traditional interpolation methods including idw ok and cok varies greatly and a non negligible part of the area is negative meanwhile gd is also overestimated in ridge areas where there are no or few observation points the gd map drawn by ml methods can be mainly divided into two categories negative values are included and negative values are not included the simulation results of mlr gwr and svr all show negative values especially for mlr and gwr a considerable number of grids exhibit simulation results of less than 5 m besides there is little difference in the gd maps drawn by rf xgbg xgbl and xgbt the numerical distribution of the simulation results can reflect the stability of the model and its ability to handle extreme values the gd values of all valid grids are counted fig s3 the gd values obtained by idw ok and cok vary greatly the highest value is more than 180 m and the minimum is less than 60 m in the results of these methods 21 64 23 52 and 20 73 of the pixels are negative respectively the simulation results of mlr gwr and svr contain non negligible negative values which account for 4 37 3 52 and 1 86 of all valid values respectively compared with xgbg xgbl and xgbt the rf algorithm simulates a smaller number of minima and its numerical distribution is less smooth the three xgb based models all have a good capability in dealing with extreme values and their simulation effect is ordered as xgbl xgbg xgbt fig 7 shows a cross section of the elevation and simulated gl in northern study area the gl generated by the interpolation methods is underestimated in the ridge region and overestimated in the valley region in the valley region the simulated gl is partially overestimated for mlr and gwr and is partially overestimated for svr the simulated gl of rf and xgb is in good agreement with ground surface elevation according to the comparison of simulation effects in table 3 and fig 7 the simulation results of xgbt are used to map the gl map of the study area fig s4 the relationship between the groundwater table and elevation is basically consistent in spatial distribution where the groundwater table rises with elevation fig 1 the results of six cases show that there is good continuity of groundwater levels in space fig s4 also there is some uneven distribution in gl where the groundwater table value is higher or lower compared to the surrounding grid based on the simulated gl a groundwater level contour map is drawn fig 8 the groundwater in the study area mainly flows from west to east some internal flow areas also exist in the study area according to the location of rivers and lakes in the study area it can be found that the groundwater flow direction is consistent with the location of rivers and lakes 4 discussion 4 1 analysis of variable importance the variable importance reflects the degree to which the explanatory variable explains the target variable gul et al 2021 the variable importance of the rf model can be measured by mean decrease in accuracy mda and mean decrease in gini mdg belgiu and drăguţ 2016 mdg is the impurity based ranking that allows splitting the input dataset to obtain similar response values for each node of the decision tree based on the variability of the measurements feng et al 2021 xgb provides three measures of variable importance gain cover and frequency gain refers to the tree gain of the model that accounts for the relative contribution of each feature qin et al 2021 in this study mdg and gain were respectively are used as variable important properties for rf and xgb models and larger values indicate more importance to the prediction of the explanatory variable fig 9 shows the variable importance results for rf based and xgb based models tpi is the most important variable for all regression models followed by elevation and tri also tpi has significantly higher importance in the rf based model than in the xgb based model in the rf based model the importance score of tpi and elevation accounts for 73 of all variables in contrast it is only 38 60 and 45 for xgbg xgbl and xgbt respectively it means that other variables in the rf based model are less significant for explaining gd than they are in the xgb based model this may be one of the reasons why the rf algorithm performs worse than the xgb algorithm in simulating groundwater depth 4 2 role of hyper parameter optimization the bayesian optimization algorithm is an important tool in tuning model parameters and measuring model performance some important parameters need to be set for the optimization process for example the loss function for the bayesian optimization algorithm adopts the number of folds for cross validation in this study the three acquisition functions including ucb ei and poi were tried for the optimization process it was found that ucb performed robustly and could give more reasonable results than ei and poi this result is consistent with that of some other studies smola and schölkopf 2004 klein et al 2017 thus ucb was adopted for parameter optimization of all models including svr rf xgbg xgbl and xgbt in this study the number of folds for cv also affects the optimization results especially when the sample size is limited moghaddam et al 2020 5 fold and 10 fold cvs are most common sun et al 2020 yang et al 2020 yin et al 2021 in this study the simulation effects after parameter optimization under different numbers of folds were compared fig 10 shows the rmse results of the optimized rf based and xgbt based models with the k fold k 2 3 10 cv taking the xgbt model as an example it can be seen that 5 fold cv contributes to the best simulation results despite the small variation in the rmse on the training and test sets the rf based simulation results for 5 fold cv are better than those of other folds 4 3 limitations of traditional interpolation methods the geostatistical interpolation methods such as kriging may not always be sufficient to capture the broad nature of spatial nonlinearity and complex features erdogan erten et al 2022 according to table 3 and figs s2 and s3 ok and cok perform better in gl interpolation than idw and cok has no obvious advantage over ok the main reason for this may be that the covariate added by cok in this study is elevation figs 5 and 9 show that in addition to elevation tpi and tri are also critical to gd it means that only considering elevation as a covariate is not sufficient moreover although there are improvements compared to ok cok is still not good at handling some nonlinear problems and similar observations can be found in some studies sadat noori et al 2013 guekie simo et al 2016 in addition due to the imbalanced observation the gd in ridge areas without observed data is overestimated fig s2 it seems that this problem is difficult to solve with current research guekie simo et al 2016 ruybal et al 2019 4 4 limitations of machine learning methods compared with traditional interpolation methods ml methods can achieve better accuracy table 3 however the gl is spatial continuous with incomplete independent spatial context erdogan erten et al 2022 the traditional interpolation methods can guarantee the continuity and stationarity of gl results between adjacent grids in contrast most ml methods rarely consider the spatial correlation of target variables reichstein et al 2019 fig s4 shows the discontinuity problem for some grids similarly fig s2 shows that the gl simulated by ml methods still suffers from the problem of non stationarity representative and intensive training samples can help to improve these problems schultz et al 2021 the gl has good spatial consistency and stationarity when more training samples are used fig s4 b and d while there are more uneven grids in the region without training samples fig s4 c and e in addition to samples algorithms and variables are also critical to overcoming the problem gwr has advantages in dealing with spatial non stationarity problems jiang et al 2017 due to its simple principle it does not show good effects in this study to reduce the impact of this problem on the results the spatial location of the target variable variables x and y was also introduced as independent variables in this study they play a non negligible role in rf based and xgb based regression models fig 9 moreover tpi tri distoriver and distolake are variables reflecting the spatial continuity of ground surface and some of them also show an important impact on rf based and xgb based models fig 9 although there is a great difference between groundwater table and ground surface the addition of these variables reduces the influence of spatial discontinuity in addition compared to physical models ml methods are black box models that lack physical processes which increases the uncertainty of the simulation results to some extent in this study to reduce uncertainty and obtain reliable results the bayesian optimization algorithm is adopted to optimize the hyperparameters of the models which also reduces the uncertainty of the simulation results to some extent 4 5 uncertainty analysis ml methods may also underestimate the gd in ridge areas with few or no observed data although the xgb algorithm overcomes the problem of imbalanced data the maximum value it can predict is limited which generally does not exceed the observed maximum in some mountainous areas due to the high topography the actual gd may exceed the maximum observed gd value therefore the ml methods still have great uncertainty for predicting the gd in the ridge area with few observations there are still some limitations in this study for example the gl changes dynamically the gl data at some points were collected only as a single value and there may be large errors for this reason this study only selected the gl data during the growing season when precipitation is relatively abundant and groundwater can be fully replenished and relatively more stable although few in number there are still some unconfined springs in the study area they have some impact on groundwater discharge and recharge especially during the rainy season in addition human activities such as vegetation construction and mining have an impact on the gl in the study area the mu us sandy land has been undergoing artificial vegetation restoration over the past few decades which has increased groundwater consumption meanwhile the study area is an important mining area especially a coal mine and mining also consumes a certain amount of groundwater the explanatory variables obtained in this study come from multiple data sources data preprocessing may introduce some errors into the final regression model for example precipitation is obtained by interpolation from meteorological sites and both the interpolation method and the data scale i e the number of sites affect the interpolation accuracy in addition some data such as soil and lithology data are adopted from other products with relatively low spatial resolution which also have certain uncertainties 5 conclusions in this study a framework was proposed for gl mapping using the groundwater related geospatial database and the xgb method the groundwater related geospatial database at a spatial resolution of 250 m was constructed based on several variables from precipitation topography soil vegetation and others the simulation results of traditional interpolation methods and ml methods are compared the results demonstrate that the xgb algorithm has superior performance in gl mapping the traditional interpolation methods including idw ok and cok achieve a poor result in the study area and a large number of negative gd values are present in their simulation results almost all ml methods mlr gwr svr rf xgbg xgbl and xgbt exhibit better simulation accuracy than the traditional interpolation methods on the test set their effectiveness also varies widely mlr and gwr are inefficient in building regression models of explanatory variables and gd r 0 8 rmse 3 m on both training and test sets followed by svr and rf their rmses are close to or exceed 3 m on both training and test sets the xgb based models xgbg xgbl and xgbt achieve better evaluation accuracy than other ml methods and they can avoid the negative value of simulated gd moreover these models perform well in the regression of imbalanced data on the training set the r values of these models are close to 1 and the rmse and mae values are close to 0 m on the test set the r values of these models are close to 0 9 and the rmse values are between 2 and 3 m and the mae values are less than 2 m among these models xgbt has the highest evaluation accuracy in this study the gl map and its contour map were drawn based on the simulation results of xgbt the groundwater flow direction is almost identical to that of rivers and lakes in the study area credit authorship contribution statement pinzeng rao data

7879,study region mu us sandy land china study focus the groundwater table in unconfined aquifers is often a subdued replica of the topography or land surface in hilly terrain spatial interpolation methods are prone to errors such as higher interpolation water level than the ground surface due to sparse observation wells meanwhile in ridge areas groundwater depth can easily be overestimated with limited groundwater observations to address these issues this paper proposes a framework to learn groundwater depth using related groundwater variables based on the extreme gradient boosting xgb machine learning method moreover the groundwater level map is drawn based on the predicted groundwater depths and elevation data new hydrological insights for the region the results obtained by the xgb algorithm are compared with those of common interpolation methods including inverse distance weighting ordinary kriging and collaborative ordinary kriging and machine learning methods including multiple linear regression geographically weighted regression support vector regression and random forest the results showed that the xgb using the tweedie loss function performs best in learning groundwater depth compared with interpolation methods and other machine learning methods and almost completely overcomes the effects of imbalanced data the topographic factors such as elevation topographic position index and topographic roughness index are key factors for groundwater depth this study provides a reference for improving regional gl mapping especially in areas of complex terrain graphical abstract ga1 keywords groundwater level mapping groundwater depth extreme gradient boosting imbalanced distribution data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction groundwater plays a critical role in water resources especially in arid areas evans et al 2020 varouchakis et al 2022 unlike surface water groundwater below the surface of the earth cannot be directly observed malekzadeh et al 2019 groundwater level gl is highly nonlinear and complex due to the influence of topography meteorology geomorphology hydrology geology and human activities ao et al 2021 drilling wells is a common approach to monitoring the gl and gl mapping is primarily based on these observed gl data sun et al 2009 fischer et al 2021 gl mapping is an important task for groundwater resource management the interpolation methods and physical process based models are the main methods to obtain groundwater flow fields through gl data from wells malekzadeh et al 2019 ao et al 2021 interpolation methods such as inverse distance weighting idw and kriging are widely used in geology and hydrology zhu et al 2017 zhou et al 2019 fischer et al 2021 these methods mainly consider the spatial correlation of interpolation points caruso and quarta 1998 and they are often applied to spatial interpolation of gl sun et al 2009 evans et al 2020 unfortunately for a large scale study area with hilly terrain and limited drilling data gl mapping by these interpolation methods will suffer from serious errors hoeksema et al 1989 ohmer et al 2017 collaborative kriging considers spatial stationarity and adds covariates to estimate the target parameter which can reduce some of the errors ahmadi and sedghamiz 2008 sadat noori et al 2013 however it cannot handle the interpolation of gl effectively desbarats et al 2002 guekie simo et al 2016 most physical models such as modflow and hydrus are developed based on the principle of water balance and the consideration of the hydrodynamic process of groundwater twarakavi et al 2008 han et al 2015 niswonger 2020 compared with mathematical statistics methods such as geostatistical interpolation physical models generally have higher estimation accuracy and better reliability malekzadeh et al 2019 miro et al 2021 however they usually require many spatiotemporal data as input and a variety of physical parameters for calibration and the uncertainty of inputs and parameters poses great challenges to the calibration and validation of numerical models malekzadeh et al 2019 also physical models often consume a lot of time for the simulation process thus it has been argued that groundwater numerical simulation is mainly applicable to small scale regions due to limited inputs aliyari et al 2019 some machine learning ml methods with good simulation effects have been widely used and are one of the current research hotspots shen 2018 reichstein et al 2019 ma et al 2021 at present ml methods have been applied to groundwater related research such as groundwater potential mapping moghaddam et al 2020 choubin and rahmati 2021 kumar et al 2021 and dynamic simulation of gl malekzadeh et al 2019 ao et al 2021 miro et al 2021 martínez santos et al 2021a 2021b adopted ml methods to map groundwater dependent ecosystems generally the application of ml methods is limited by three points the algorithm itself the selection of feature variables and the acquisition of samples zhang and ma 2012 cracknell and reading 2014 rao et al 2018 achieng 2019 feng et al 2021 due to these limitations few studies have realized large scale gl mapping using ml methods lendzioch et al 2021 with the development of methodologies and algorithms several ml methods have been proved to be efficient for regression problems taking the random forest rf algorithm as an example it has been shown that the rf algorithm is an excellent classifier or regressor because of its robustness and efficiency pal 2005 clark et al 2010 sun et al 2020 zi chen et al 2021 however similar to other ml algorithms the rf algorithm does not perform well when learning from extremely imbalanced training data lin et al 2021 recently the extreme gradient boosting xgb algorithm has received much attention in many fields chen and guestrin 2016 similar to the rf algorithm xgb is also a tree ensemble algorithm the main difference is that the rf algorithm is based on bagging creating individual learners independently while the xgb algorithm uses boosting creating individual learners with strong correlations and generates the learners sequentially zhou 2021 because boosting algorithms are iterative algorithms that place different weights on the training distribution in each iteration it can improve the regression or classification performance for rare classes and extreme values weiss 2004 many studies have shown that the xgb algorithm achieves better efficiency and accuracy than the rf algorithm barzegar et al 2021 kiangala and wang 2021 shi et al 2021 loss function plays an important role in improving the performance of some ml algorithms wang et al 2022 also a reasonable loss function can increase the robustness of the algorithm gul et al 2021 the xgb algorithm provides multiple loss functions for regression and classification e g linear and logistic loss functions and these loss functions can be customized chen and guestrin 2016 hyper parameters affect the robustness and simulation accuracy of some ml algorithms mangasarian and musicant 2000 barzegar et al 2018 miro et al 2021 grid search based approaches are commonly used for tuning hyper parameters gul et al 2021 however grid search does not guarantee to find the optimal solution and is extremely computationally expensive because it uses the exhaust method to adjust parameters khan et al 2020 qin et al 2021 the bayesian approach is a good choice for optimizing the hyper parameters of algorithms brochu et al 2010 sun et al 2020 2021 compared to grid search it refers to previous evaluations for the next round of hyper parameters optimization thus reducing computational overhead klein et al 2017 this study takes the mu us sandy land an arid area with complex terrain as the research object first a groundwater related geospatial database at a spatial resolution of 250 m is constructed including elevation average annual precipitation lithology etc then according to the database multiple ml methods including multiple linear regression mlr support vector regression svr geographically weighted regression gwr rf and xgb are used to learn the groundwater depth in unconfined aquifers with the data of hundreds of wells the hyper parameters are tuned using the bayesian optimization algorithm finally the gl maps are drawn based on the predicted groundwater depth gd and elevation data 2 materials and methodology 2 1 study area the study area is located in the southeast of ordos inner mongolia china which belongs to the mu us sandy land and occupies an area of 20 703 km2 e 107 49 109 57 n 37 39 39 43 fig 1 it belongs to a semi arid area and the annual precipitation is generally between 300 and 500 mm groundwater is a key source of water for agricultural irrigation industrial processes mining and drinking water in the study area zhang and wang 2020 the terrain of the study area is complex including mountains plateaus foothills basins and plains the overall topography gradually decreases from northwest to southeast there are also some inner flow zones and lakes in the study area fig 1 due to the uneven terrain the unconfined gl vary widely in space which means that groundwater resources are unevenly distributed in the study area a quaternary loose layer pore aquifer formed a unified water bearing system with the cretaceous fissure pore unconfined aquifers the unconfined aquifer is very thick and the maximum thickness is more than 1000 m wang et al 2017 the unconfined groundwater receives recharge at the aquifer outcropping area and flows to rivers or lakes guangcai et al 2010 2 2 materials fig 2 shows the overall research framework of this study it mainly includes construction of the groundwater related geospatial database filtering of explanatory variables selection and preprocessing of training test samples construction and comparison of regression models and gl mapping 2 2 1 groundwater data in recent years a certain number of groundwater observation wells have been constructed in the study area this study obtained the daily observed gl and gd of 178 wells from 2018 to 2020 meanwhile the groundwater depth of some drilling points was obtained from local government departments from 2015 to 2020 a total of 332 sample points were collected in this study and their locations are shown in fig 1 since most of the groundwater data at the drilling point are taken in summer to exclude the influence of seasonal fluctuations on gl this study used the average gl during the vegetation growing season from may to september to represent the water level of the wells with long term observations fig 3 shows the numerical distribution of gd at all points with a mean of 8 86 m and a standard deviation of 11 84 m the distribution of gd is very imbalanced where large values have fewer observations only three points have a gd exceeding 50 m and they are distributed at 50 60 m 60 70 m and 70 80 m respectively due to limited data 80 of the samples were selected as training sets in this study and the other 20 were used for testing fig 1 2 2 2 groundwater related variables some explanatory variables related to groundwater were selected in this study and they were divided into five types table 1 the geospatial database is constructed based on these variables 1 precipitation precipitation data were obtained from the china meteorological data service centre http data cma cn and local government departments a total of 15 weather stations near the study area were involved in this study fig 1 the average annual precipitation data from 2018 to 2020 were calculated further the idw method was employed to obtain average annual precipitation raster data at a resolution of 250 m the average annual precipitation in the study area gradually decreases from southwest to northeast fig 4 a 2 topographical factors several topographical factors significantly affect groundwater availability elevation slope aspect topographic position index tpi topographic roughness index tri flow accumulation fa and topographic wetness index twi were selected in this study the cumulative recharge of groundwater decreases with the increase of elevation the slope affects surface and subsurface flow velocity and infiltration process the aspect reflects the flow direction of grids tpi and tri reflect the elevation relationship between adjacent grids and characterize the storage capacity of water kumar et al 2021 tpi and tri are calculated as follows 1 tpi z 0 1 n i 1 n z i 2 tri 1 n i 1 n z 0 z i 2 where z 0 represents the elevation of the center point z i represents the elevation within the neighborhood grids and n is the number of selected neighborhood grids the value of tpi and tri will change with the focus window size to select a reasonable focus window size this study calculated the tpi and tri value under eight different window sizes 3 3 5 5 7 7 9 9 13 13 15 15 and 17 17 tpi3 represents the tpi value with a window size of 3 3 twi can reflect the water storage capacity of the corresponding grid and its calculation formula is 3 twi ln a s tan β where a s is accumulated area upstream of the grid and β is the slope srtm dem data with a resolution of 90 m were used to obtain the elevation data table 1 https srtm csi cgiar org srtmdata which was resampled into 250 m raster data in this study fig 4 b slope aspect flow accumulation fa tpi tri and twi were calculated based on the dem data fig 4 c h 3 vegetation index products common vegetation indices include ndvi and evi this study obtained the vegetation index data from the mod13q1 product to make the results more reliable the average ndvi and evi were calculated for the 2018 2020 growing season from may to september meanwhile according to the calculated average ndvi the fractional vegetation cover fvc desbarats et al 2002 was calculated and the calculation formula is as follows 4 fvc ndvi ndvi soil ndvi veg ndvi soil where ndvi soil is the ndvi value of the bare soil area and ndvi veg is the ndvi value of the pixel completely covered by vegetation in this study the ndvi values of the 99th and 1st percentile were selected as the ndvi value of pure vegetation and bare soil respectively fig 4 i k shows the evi ndvi and fvc in the study area 4 soil data several soil factors have a certain influence on the replenishment and consumption of groundwater such as the soil bulk density bd and soil structure ss data this study obtained bd and ss data from national tibetan plateau data center http westdc westgis ac cn shangguan et al 2012 the data has a resolution of 1 km and it was resampled to a resolution of 250 m in this study fig 4 l m 5 other auxiliary data in addition to the above mentioned factors several other factors also affect the groundwater table such as lithology and land cover the lithology data was obtained from the national 1 1000 0000 geological map fig 4 p considering the recharge and discharge of groundwater by rivers and lakes this study also calculated two indexes distance to rivers distoriver and distance to lakes distolake the data of river and lake systems were obtained from a 1 1000 000 national basic geographic dataset fig 4 n o in addition land cover data were obtained from the european aviation agency https viewer esa worldcover org worldcover the data mainly consists of ten types and the study area covers eight of them fig 4 q 2 3 methods 2 3 1 pairwise correlation method pairwise correlation is a non parametric statistics method developed for the discrimination of features gere et al 2015 it can be used to evaluate collinearity between variables dormann et al 2013 pairwise correlation is often calculated using the linear correlation coefficient r for a pair of variables x y r is given by the following formula 5 r i x i x i y i y i i x i x i 2 i y i y i 2 where x i is the mean of x and y i is the mean of y the r value between 1 and 1 represents the correlation between x and y r 0 indicates a positive correlation r 0 indicates a negative correlation and r 0 indicates no correlation at all according to the study of dormann et al 2013 when the correlation coefficient r is greater than 0 7 or less than 0 7 it is considered that there is high collinearity between explanatory variables 2 3 2 interpolation methods statistical interpolation methods such as idw and kriging are commonly used to interpolate the groundwater table sadat noori et al 2013 in the idw method the reciprocal of the distance is used as a weight and the interpolated value of the sampling point is calculated 6 z i 1 n 1 d i q z i i 1 n 1 d i q where z i is the value of the adjacent sampling point i i 1 2 n d i is the distance between the interpolated point and the adjacent sampling point q is a constant and it usually takes a value of 2 the kriging method aims to establish the best linear unbiased estimator based on the available data of regionalized variables and structural features of a variogram hoeksema et al 1989 ordinary kriging ok is one of the most common kriging methods and it can be expressed as 7 z ˆ x p i 1 n λ i z x i where z ˆ x p is the interpolated value at location x p z i is the value of the adjacent sampling point x i i 1 2 n λ i is the weight of z x i calculated by variogram models collaborative kriging introduces other related variables to improve the kriging ahmadi and sedghamiz 2008 its general form is 8 l 1 v i 1 n λ il γ lv x i x j μ v γ lv x i x j i 1 n λ il 1 1 u 0 1 u where u and v are the primary and covariate variables respectively γ x i x j is the value of the variogram corresponding to a vector with origin in x i and extremity in x j the elevation is a key factor that affects gl this study adopted the coordinative ordinary kriging cok method and introduced elevation as a covariate to interpolate the gl 2 3 3 machine learning methods several popular and promising ml methods were selected in this study including mlr svr gwr rf and xgb support vector machine svm is based on the statistical learning theory and can represent nonlinear relationships well gul et al 2021 it converts the nonlinear space into a high dimensional linear space through a nonlinear function and then finds the optimal linear interface in the new space mangasarian and musicant 2000 because of its simple structure good generalization ability and fast learning speed svm is one of the most commonly used classifiers or regressors barzegar et al 2018 wang et al 2019 miro et al 2021 when used for regression it is also called svr gwr considers the spatial non stationary of variables in different locations fischer and getis 2010 it introduces spatial regression coefficients based on ordinary linear regression to overcome spatial heterogeneity as much as possible jiang et al 2017 9 y i β i 0 k 1 k β ik x ik ε i where x ik is the independent variable y i is the dependent variable in location i β ik is the spatial regression coefficient of explanatory variables and ε i is the residual the ensemble learning method trains multiple base learners and combines their predictions into a reliable output in this way it makes the simulated result more reasonable and has a stronger generalization ability zhang and ma 2012 the rf algorithm is a bagging type ensemble of multiple decision trees mohana et al 2021 compared with a single decision tree the rf algorithm can improve the simulation accuracy with greater probability belgiu and drăguţ 2016 however due to training many trees on the random subset and adopting the mean of a result set of various trees as the final output the rf algorithm is biased to the data with various categorical variables anon 2021 different from the rf algorithm the xgb algorithm is a boosting type ensemble of multiple cart decision trees chen and guestrin 2016 the predicted result of the boosting type tree ensemble model can be expressed as 10 y i ˆ x i k 1 k f k x i f k f where f is the space of the regression tree k is the total number of trees indicating that the model uses k additive functions f k x i is the weighted score of the k th tree on i th input data x i xgb adopts a regularized learning objective to optimize the simulation results 11 obj i 1 n l y i y i ˆ k 1 k ω f k where l is the loss function n is the total number of the input ω is the regularization term to reduce the model complexity and prevent overfitting the loss function has a great influence on the final simulation results xgb provides several loss functions for regression such as squared error squared log error logistic gamma and tweedie and the squared error is the default in practical applications the selection of loss function should be according to the distribution characteristics of predicted variables therefore xgb allows users to customize the loss function for shallow groundwater in unconfined aquifers its gl should not exceed the ground elevation i e gd is not less than 0 m several loss functions such as gamma logistic and tweedie can satisfy this requirement in this study these loss functions were all selected to build xgb based regression models xgbg xgbl and xgbt in order to meet the requirement that gd is not less than 0 m we use gd as a predictor to construct the regression model using ml methods several gd related factors including precipitation topography vegetation soil and other were used as explanatory variables then the corresponding gl can be calculated as gd f precipitation topography vegetation soil other gl elevation gd 12 where f represents the regression function of the ml method mlr gwr svr rf xgbg xgbl and xgbt 2 3 4 bayesian optimization algorithm to reduce the errors as much as possible and prevent overfitting this study optimized the hyper parameters of the ml algorithms specifically the bayesian approach was adopted to optimize the hyper parameters the bayesian optimization algorithm builds a probabilistic model based on the evaluation results of the black box function to minimize the objective function jones et al 1998 it has the advantages of short time consumption and strong robustness sun et al 2020 the bayesian optimization algorithm mainly contains two major arguments one argument is a prior over function which expresses assumptions about the function under optimization the gaussian process is random and its prior is commonly used because of its flexibility and analytic tractability klein et al 2017 the optimized black box objective function in the gaussian process can be expressed 13 f x gp e x k x x where x represents the hyperparameter to be optimized e x represents a mean function and k x x represents a covariance function the other argument is an acquisition function used to construct a utility function from the model posterior three common acquisition functions can be selected upper confidence bound ucb probability of improvement pi and expected improvement ei brochu et al 2010 the ucb acquisition function can be calculated as 14 a ucb x μ x β σ x where β is a trade off parameter representing the upper confidence boundary μ x is the expected value and σ x is the standard deviation value the pi acquisition function can be expressed as a pi x φ γ x where 15 γ x μ x f x σ x where f x represents the existing maximum value and φ is the cumulative distribution function the ei acquisition function can be calculated as 16 a pi x σ x φ x μ x f x φ γ x σ 0 0 σ 0 where f x represents the existing maximum value φ and φ x represent the cumulative distribution function and the probability density function of the standard normal distribution respectively in addition the objective function needs to be determined in this study the 5 fold cross validation cv accuracy was taken as the optimization objective 2 3 5 evaluation index the performances of these models in gd were evaluated using four statistical indicators including correlation coefficient r root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae the formula of the correlation coefficient refers to eq 5 rmse and mae are calculated as 17 rmse 1 n gd o gd s 2 18 mae 1 n i 1 n gd o gd s where gd o and gd s are the observed and simulated groundwater depths respectively cov represents the covariance function var is the variance and n is the number of train or test samples higher values of r closer to 1 and lower values of rmse and mae closer to 0 indicate good prediction accuracy of regression models 3 results 3 1 filtering of explanatory variables feature collinearity is evaluated through pairwise correlations between variables fig 5 shows the correlation matrix of variables some variables are highly correlated with a correlation coefficient greater than 0 7 to avoid the collinearity problem this study chose one of the collinearity variables based on their correlation coefficient with gd thus the fvc was selected instead of evi and ndvi rgd evi 0 02 rgd ndvi 0 07 and rgd fvc 0 08 correlation coefficients of tpi or tri and gd at different focus window sizes are shown fig s1 it can be seen that as the focus window size increases rgd tri gradually increases but the increment rate decreases when the focus window size reaches 17 17 the correlation coefficient hardly increases meanwhile rgd tpi increases first and then decreases and the maximum value is obtained under the 13 13 window size thus the tri with a window size of 17 17 and the tpi with a window size of 13 13 were chosen as explanatory variables notably there is a high correlation between slope and tri but when the focus window size of tpi is 17 17 the correlation coefficient between slope and tri is less than 0 7 rslope tri 0 68 in addition the direct correlation coefficient between other explanatory variables ranges between 0 7 and 0 7 in all cases finally 17 explanatory variables were selected for the regression model fig 2 3 2 validation and comparison of all methods in this study some key hyperparameters of the svm rf and xgb model were optimized using the bayesian approach the optimized values are presented in table 2 the corresponding regression models were constructed according to the optimization results of the above hyper parameters table 3 shows the evaluation accuracy of traditional interpolation and ml methods it can be observed that the traditional interpolation methods including idw ok and cok have low accuracy in gl interpolation with large rmse larger than 6 m and mae between 3 and 7 m and low correlation coefficients lower than 0 8 on the test set the simulation effects of ml methods show significant differences mlr and gwr are less effective their rmses on the training set are about 7 m and the rmses on the test set are more than 3 m the rs are around 0 8 on both training and test sets the maes on the training set are more than 4 m and the maes on the test set are more than 2 m as for svr and rf their rs are greater than 0 9 on the training set and greater than 0 8 on the test set their rmses are between 2 and 3 m on the training set and are about 3 m on the test set xgbg xgbl and xgbt all have good regression accuracy their rs are close to 1 on the training set and close to 0 9 on the test set their rmses are close to 0 m on the training set and less than 3 m on the test set their maes are close to 0 m on the training set and less than 2 m on the test set according to these evaluation results on the training set and test set the performance of the ml methods is ordered as mlr gwr svr rf xgbl xgbg xgbt to further investigate the impact of imbalanced data on the model performance the simulation results of all the ml methods on the training set and test set were compared fig 6 on the training set the simulation results of xgbg and xgbt are excellent and the problem of imbalanced data is almost eliminated xgbl also achieves good results but there are some small deviations between observed and simulated gd svr also shows large gd values as well and there are significant overestimates and underestimates when gd is less than 30 m rf underestimates large gd values and overestimates small gd values fig 6 a and c it means that the rf algorithm is not effective in dealing with imbalanced data the results of mlr and gwr are unreliable for gd prediction compared to the training set the test set separates the three xgb models on the test set the results of xgbl deviate more from the observed values than xgbg and xgbt and rf performs better than svr the result is consistent with that shown in table 3 3 3 groundwater level mapping this gd map is presented in fig s2 the gd map drawn by the traditional interpolation methods including idw ok and cok varies greatly and a non negligible part of the area is negative meanwhile gd is also overestimated in ridge areas where there are no or few observation points the gd map drawn by ml methods can be mainly divided into two categories negative values are included and negative values are not included the simulation results of mlr gwr and svr all show negative values especially for mlr and gwr a considerable number of grids exhibit simulation results of less than 5 m besides there is little difference in the gd maps drawn by rf xgbg xgbl and xgbt the numerical distribution of the simulation results can reflect the stability of the model and its ability to handle extreme values the gd values of all valid grids are counted fig s3 the gd values obtained by idw ok and cok vary greatly the highest value is more than 180 m and the minimum is less than 60 m in the results of these methods 21 64 23 52 and 20 73 of the pixels are negative respectively the simulation results of mlr gwr and svr contain non negligible negative values which account for 4 37 3 52 and 1 86 of all valid values respectively compared with xgbg xgbl and xgbt the rf algorithm simulates a smaller number of minima and its numerical distribution is less smooth the three xgb based models all have a good capability in dealing with extreme values and their simulation effect is ordered as xgbl xgbg xgbt fig 7 shows a cross section of the elevation and simulated gl in northern study area the gl generated by the interpolation methods is underestimated in the ridge region and overestimated in the valley region in the valley region the simulated gl is partially overestimated for mlr and gwr and is partially overestimated for svr the simulated gl of rf and xgb is in good agreement with ground surface elevation according to the comparison of simulation effects in table 3 and fig 7 the simulation results of xgbt are used to map the gl map of the study area fig s4 the relationship between the groundwater table and elevation is basically consistent in spatial distribution where the groundwater table rises with elevation fig 1 the results of six cases show that there is good continuity of groundwater levels in space fig s4 also there is some uneven distribution in gl where the groundwater table value is higher or lower compared to the surrounding grid based on the simulated gl a groundwater level contour map is drawn fig 8 the groundwater in the study area mainly flows from west to east some internal flow areas also exist in the study area according to the location of rivers and lakes in the study area it can be found that the groundwater flow direction is consistent with the location of rivers and lakes 4 discussion 4 1 analysis of variable importance the variable importance reflects the degree to which the explanatory variable explains the target variable gul et al 2021 the variable importance of the rf model can be measured by mean decrease in accuracy mda and mean decrease in gini mdg belgiu and drăguţ 2016 mdg is the impurity based ranking that allows splitting the input dataset to obtain similar response values for each node of the decision tree based on the variability of the measurements feng et al 2021 xgb provides three measures of variable importance gain cover and frequency gain refers to the tree gain of the model that accounts for the relative contribution of each feature qin et al 2021 in this study mdg and gain were respectively are used as variable important properties for rf and xgb models and larger values indicate more importance to the prediction of the explanatory variable fig 9 shows the variable importance results for rf based and xgb based models tpi is the most important variable for all regression models followed by elevation and tri also tpi has significantly higher importance in the rf based model than in the xgb based model in the rf based model the importance score of tpi and elevation accounts for 73 of all variables in contrast it is only 38 60 and 45 for xgbg xgbl and xgbt respectively it means that other variables in the rf based model are less significant for explaining gd than they are in the xgb based model this may be one of the reasons why the rf algorithm performs worse than the xgb algorithm in simulating groundwater depth 4 2 role of hyper parameter optimization the bayesian optimization algorithm is an important tool in tuning model parameters and measuring model performance some important parameters need to be set for the optimization process for example the loss function for the bayesian optimization algorithm adopts the number of folds for cross validation in this study the three acquisition functions including ucb ei and poi were tried for the optimization process it was found that ucb performed robustly and could give more reasonable results than ei and poi this result is consistent with that of some other studies smola and schölkopf 2004 klein et al 2017 thus ucb was adopted for parameter optimization of all models including svr rf xgbg xgbl and xgbt in this study the number of folds for cv also affects the optimization results especially when the sample size is limited moghaddam et al 2020 5 fold and 10 fold cvs are most common sun et al 2020 yang et al 2020 yin et al 2021 in this study the simulation effects after parameter optimization under different numbers of folds were compared fig 10 shows the rmse results of the optimized rf based and xgbt based models with the k fold k 2 3 10 cv taking the xgbt model as an example it can be seen that 5 fold cv contributes to the best simulation results despite the small variation in the rmse on the training and test sets the rf based simulation results for 5 fold cv are better than those of other folds 4 3 limitations of traditional interpolation methods the geostatistical interpolation methods such as kriging may not always be sufficient to capture the broad nature of spatial nonlinearity and complex features erdogan erten et al 2022 according to table 3 and figs s2 and s3 ok and cok perform better in gl interpolation than idw and cok has no obvious advantage over ok the main reason for this may be that the covariate added by cok in this study is elevation figs 5 and 9 show that in addition to elevation tpi and tri are also critical to gd it means that only considering elevation as a covariate is not sufficient moreover although there are improvements compared to ok cok is still not good at handling some nonlinear problems and similar observations can be found in some studies sadat noori et al 2013 guekie simo et al 2016 in addition due to the imbalanced observation the gd in ridge areas without observed data is overestimated fig s2 it seems that this problem is difficult to solve with current research guekie simo et al 2016 ruybal et al 2019 4 4 limitations of machine learning methods compared with traditional interpolation methods ml methods can achieve better accuracy table 3 however the gl is spatial continuous with incomplete independent spatial context erdogan erten et al 2022 the traditional interpolation methods can guarantee the continuity and stationarity of gl results between adjacent grids in contrast most ml methods rarely consider the spatial correlation of target variables reichstein et al 2019 fig s4 shows the discontinuity problem for some grids similarly fig s2 shows that the gl simulated by ml methods still suffers from the problem of non stationarity representative and intensive training samples can help to improve these problems schultz et al 2021 the gl has good spatial consistency and stationarity when more training samples are used fig s4 b and d while there are more uneven grids in the region without training samples fig s4 c and e in addition to samples algorithms and variables are also critical to overcoming the problem gwr has advantages in dealing with spatial non stationarity problems jiang et al 2017 due to its simple principle it does not show good effects in this study to reduce the impact of this problem on the results the spatial location of the target variable variables x and y was also introduced as independent variables in this study they play a non negligible role in rf based and xgb based regression models fig 9 moreover tpi tri distoriver and distolake are variables reflecting the spatial continuity of ground surface and some of them also show an important impact on rf based and xgb based models fig 9 although there is a great difference between groundwater table and ground surface the addition of these variables reduces the influence of spatial discontinuity in addition compared to physical models ml methods are black box models that lack physical processes which increases the uncertainty of the simulation results to some extent in this study to reduce uncertainty and obtain reliable results the bayesian optimization algorithm is adopted to optimize the hyperparameters of the models which also reduces the uncertainty of the simulation results to some extent 4 5 uncertainty analysis ml methods may also underestimate the gd in ridge areas with few or no observed data although the xgb algorithm overcomes the problem of imbalanced data the maximum value it can predict is limited which generally does not exceed the observed maximum in some mountainous areas due to the high topography the actual gd may exceed the maximum observed gd value therefore the ml methods still have great uncertainty for predicting the gd in the ridge area with few observations there are still some limitations in this study for example the gl changes dynamically the gl data at some points were collected only as a single value and there may be large errors for this reason this study only selected the gl data during the growing season when precipitation is relatively abundant and groundwater can be fully replenished and relatively more stable although few in number there are still some unconfined springs in the study area they have some impact on groundwater discharge and recharge especially during the rainy season in addition human activities such as vegetation construction and mining have an impact on the gl in the study area the mu us sandy land has been undergoing artificial vegetation restoration over the past few decades which has increased groundwater consumption meanwhile the study area is an important mining area especially a coal mine and mining also consumes a certain amount of groundwater the explanatory variables obtained in this study come from multiple data sources data preprocessing may introduce some errors into the final regression model for example precipitation is obtained by interpolation from meteorological sites and both the interpolation method and the data scale i e the number of sites affect the interpolation accuracy in addition some data such as soil and lithology data are adopted from other products with relatively low spatial resolution which also have certain uncertainties 5 conclusions in this study a framework was proposed for gl mapping using the groundwater related geospatial database and the xgb method the groundwater related geospatial database at a spatial resolution of 250 m was constructed based on several variables from precipitation topography soil vegetation and others the simulation results of traditional interpolation methods and ml methods are compared the results demonstrate that the xgb algorithm has superior performance in gl mapping the traditional interpolation methods including idw ok and cok achieve a poor result in the study area and a large number of negative gd values are present in their simulation results almost all ml methods mlr gwr svr rf xgbg xgbl and xgbt exhibit better simulation accuracy than the traditional interpolation methods on the test set their effectiveness also varies widely mlr and gwr are inefficient in building regression models of explanatory variables and gd r 0 8 rmse 3 m on both training and test sets followed by svr and rf their rmses are close to or exceed 3 m on both training and test sets the xgb based models xgbg xgbl and xgbt achieve better evaluation accuracy than other ml methods and they can avoid the negative value of simulated gd moreover these models perform well in the regression of imbalanced data on the training set the r values of these models are close to 1 and the rmse and mae values are close to 0 m on the test set the r values of these models are close to 0 9 and the rmse values are between 2 and 3 m and the mae values are less than 2 m among these models xgbt has the highest evaluation accuracy in this study the gl map and its contour map were drawn based on the simulation results of xgbt the groundwater flow direction is almost identical to that of rivers and lakes in the study area credit authorship contribution statement pinzeng rao data
