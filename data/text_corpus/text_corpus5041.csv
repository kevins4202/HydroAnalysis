25205,correlative ecological niche models enms aim to approximate the environmentally suitable areas for a species recently studies have explored the minimum number of occurrence records needed to implement enms however cosmopolitan species with many occurrence records have their own challenges and the effects of larger sample sizes on enm performance have yet to be determined to address this issue we focused on a new world rodent peromyscus maniculatus we obtained locality data from gbif 13 199 unique records and spatially filtered the localities we then modeled suitable area for the species using maxent two different environmental datasets at different spatial resolutions and different numbers of occurrence records with 25 replicates per sample size we evaluated the models with k fold cross validation auc and two omission rates further we calculated the variability among predictions within and between datasets to indicate variation in geography generally the auc and omission rate both decreased as sample size increased lastly as sample size increased similarities in geography increased within and between datasets for p maniculatus we get similar performing models both in terms of geographic predictions and evaluation statistics with as few as 10 20 of the maximum number of localities for each environmental dataset using a large number of occurrence records may not be necessary for enms and in fact may hinder model performance keywords occurrence records ecological niche model maxent peromyscus maniculatus sample size species distribution model 1 introduction ecological niche models enms oft termed species distribution models are correlative models that approximate the environmentally suitable areas for a species they do so by comparing the overall environmental conditions available to the species with the conditions at localities where the species occurs peterson et al 2011 because enms can be projected across time and space they are frequently used in a wide range of ecological and evolutionary studies however despite their relevance to many fields several methodological issues such as sample bias correlation of variables model evaluation hinder their implementation in many systems anderson 2012 merow et al 2013 here we study the effects of large numbers of occurrence records on enms several studies have determined the minimum number of occurrence records needed to implement enms for different algorithms papeş and gaubert 2007 proosdij et al 2016 stockwell and peterson 2002 wisz et al 2008 revealing that as few as five localities can produce biologically meaningful models galante et al 2018 pearson et al 2007 shcheglovitova and anderson 2013 however cosmopolitan species with many occurrence records present their own challenges and the effects of larger sample sizes on models have yet to be determined these species typically have large geographic extents encompassing heterogeneous environments which could potentially pose problems when trying to estimate the environmental suitability of areas using too few localities may not capture the species entire niche however using too many occurrence records may not increase model accuracy and could potentially hinder model performance i e by limiting the amount of available background localities and reducing discriminatory ability stockwell and peterson 2002 vanderwal et al 2009 further as sample size increases so do associated issues of sampling bias and georeferencing errors which could potentially lead to overfit models bloom et al 2018 boria et al 2014 in this study we aim to determine how large sample sizes affect enm evaluations and predictions in geography specifically using a widely distributed species peromyscus maniculatus we calibrated and evaluated our models using a spatial partition method two different environmental datasets at different spatial resolutions worldclim hijmans et al 2005 and community climate simulation model 3 ccsm3 lorenz et al 2016 and an increasing number of localities further we evaluated the predictions in geographic space to determine differences between the different datasets when they are projected across space we explored if using smaller datasets would produce similar models to larger datasets without noticeable improvements in model performance and in predictions the results suggest that as sample size increases there isn t necessarily a noticeable increase in model performance when modeling species with a large number of occurrence records it may not be necessary to use all localities for enms and could potentially affect model performance negatively 2 methods 2 1 input data we conducted analyses with a new world rodent peromyscus maniculatus north american deer mouse which is indigenous to and distributed widely across north america shorter et al 2012 this species can be found in every terrestrial ecosystem and is the most diverse and widespread species of deer mouse bedford and hoekstra 2015 dewey and dawson 2001 this species provides a good system because there are currently more than 100 000 occurrence records for p maniculatus in the global biodiversity information facility gbif we downloaded all gbif records that contained coordinates a preserved specimen and didn t have any geospatial errors using the r v 3 4 1 r development core team 2016 package rgbif chamberlain 2017 we then removed all duplicate records and all localities that were placed in the ocean and outside the known geographic range based on the natureserve range estimate patterson et al 2007 these steps led to a final set of 13 199 unique p maniculatus localities despite efforts to improve data quality we acknowledge errors associated with gbif data e g beck et al 2014 however the main goal of this study is the effects of large number of occurrence records on enms and not determine p maniculatus environmental suitability generally easily accessible roads are sampled more frequently generating issues with sampling bias hijmans et al 2000 kadmon et al 2004 reddy and dávalos 2003 additionally spatial biases within gbif datasets have been shown to negatively affect enm performance beck et al 2014 to reduce sampling bias we spatially filtered the occurrence dataset to ensure that no two localities were within a pre determined distance of one another while retaining the most localities possible using the spthin package in r aiello lammens et al 2015 this method effectively reduces artificially induced spatial auto correlation boria et al 2014 fourcade et al 2014 kramer schadt et al 2013 because of the difference in resolution among our climate predictor datasets see below we used a different distance for each climate dataset based on their grid cell size 25 km for the worldclim dataset and 75 km for ccsm3 the worldclim dataset was reduced to 3334 localities after applying the spatial filter and the ccsm3 dataset was condensed to 990 occurrence records from these full datasets we then randomly sampled different numbers of occurrence records with 25 replicates for each sample size the worldclim sample sizes were 25 50 100 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 for ccsm3 we used 25 50 75 100 150 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 these were the occurrence datasets used in the modeling exercises described below we used two different climate simulations that include climate inferences for the present day worldclim hijmans et al 2005 and community climate simulation model 3 ccsm3 liu et al 2009 downscaled by lorenz et al 2016 these two simulations emphasize different tradeoffs worldclim variables are downscaled to 1 km 1 km grid cells for the entire world for present day as well as 7000 and 21 000 years ago and thus have better spatial resolution ccsm3 variables are downscaled to 0 5 0 5 degrees 50 km 50 km grid cells for north america from 21 000 years ago to the present day at 500 year intervals and thus have better temporal resolution although we do not consider paleoclimates in this paper all enms are based only on contemporary climate inferences our ultimate research goal is to infer p maniculatus climate suitability and hindcast the enms to the past which motivated our inclusion of these two climate models the worldclim dataset has 19 bioclimatic variables that reflect aspects of temperature and precipitation hijmans et al 2005 the worldclim variables are known to be correlated however maxent is a machine learning algorithm that uses regularization to reduce complexity especially regarding correlated variables and thus not all variables are necessarily included in the final model elith et al 2011 phillips and dudík 2008 the ccsm3 environmental variables consist of 27 variables that also reflect features of temperature and precipitation lorenz et al 2016 however for the ccsm3 variables we followed the procedure of maguire et al 2016 and only used the six least correlated variables over the last 21 000 years minimum precipitation of the driest quarter maximum temperature of the warmest quarter mean yearly potential evapotranspiration maximum precipitation of the wettest quarter mean yearly water deficit index and mean yearly actual evapotranspiration to approximate modeling assumptions regarding dispersal and biotic interactions more closely we delimited a custom study region for the full dataset 13 199 localities appendix 1 in supplementary file specifically by drawing a minimum convex polygon around the localities and adding a 0 5 buffer anderson and raza 2010 barve et al 2011 background localities for calibration default number of 10 000 were taken from within the delimited study region only 2 2 ecological niche modeling we used a machine learning approach maxent v 3 3 3k phillips et al 2006 phillips and dudík 2008 to generate the enms this method is a presence background technique and has performed well in comparison with other techniques elith et al 2006 wisz et al 2008 but see fitzpatrick et al 2013 royle et al 2012 to simplify the current work we employed the default settings feature class and regularization in maxent for each sample size we calibrated and evaluated the enms using a spatial partition approach using the r package enmeval muscarella et al 2014 the geographic range was divided into four quadrants k 4 with approximately equal number of occurrence records we then built models using a jackknife approach k 1 and evaluated models within the unused partition boria et al 2014 radosavljevic and anderson 2014 maxent sampled background data for the environmental variables from only the regions corresponding to the quadrants used during calibration phillips et al 2008 we did this a total of four times for each dataset so that each partition was used for evaluation once we calculated evaluation statistics see below for each quadrant and averaged across the four iterations we evaluated the models using threshold independent and dependent methods the threshold independent measure area under the curve auc of the receiver operating characteristic plot is a rank based measure of discriminatory ability of the model we calculated these two ways 1 using all localities for each dataset according to the chosen sample size projected across the entire study region full model auc 2 calculating auc for each evaluation quadrant and averaging the four iterations mean auc the threshold dependent measures were based on different omission rate thresholding rules 1 minimum training presence mtp and 2 10 calibration omission rate omission rate is the proportion of evaluation localities that are not correctly predicted as present and measures model overfitting overfit models have omission rates higher than theoretical expectations the mtp sets the threshold at the smallest value of the prediction for any grid cell that contains a calibration locality and has an expected omission rate of zero for evaluation localities and is a more conservative measure of model fitness similarly the 10 calibration omission rate rule sets the threshold at a value that excludes the 10 of calibration localities with lowest prediction and has an expected omission rate of 0 10 pearson et al 2007 we averaged the evaluation statistics across all 25 replicates for each sample size and calculated standard deviation finally for each environmental dataset we ran models and calculated the evaluation statistics using all filtered localities available the full datasets to determine variability in geography among models we measured the pairwise similarity by calculating schoener s d values using the r package enmeval muscarella et al 2014 warren et al 2008 schoener s d is a pixel by pixel comparison between two predictions across the entire study region with scores ranging from 0 no overlap to 1 identical models warren et al 2008 we calculated pairwise schoener s d between all 25 replicate models within each sample size to determine variability with each dataset size additionally we calculated the pairwise d values between each sample size and the maximum sample size this allowed us to determine how similar the models from each sample size were compared with the datasets that contained the most information the largest sample of occurrence records we averaged the pairwise d values within and between samples sizes and calculated standard deviations we evaluated the distribution of means for each sample size using two variables for each environmental dataset we extracted the climate data for every occurrence record from the two variables that provided the largest percent contribution for the full dataset maxent model then we calculated the mean value for each dataset per sample size and plotted the density of the distribution of means for each sample size lastly we plotted the mean value for the full dataset to determine how the distribution changes as we increase sample size 3 results 3 1 model evaluation for the ccsm3 datasets as sample size increased auc and omission rate decreased fig 1 when using the full dataset the auc was lower and the omission rate was higher than samples sizes of similar magnitude fig 1 additionally as sample size increased similarities in geography increased within datasets and between each dataset and the maximum set 800 occurrence records fig 3 lastly as we increased the sample size the distribution of means for each sample size narrowed around the mean value of the full dataset sfig 1 a b for the worldclim datasets we recovered similar patterns for model performance and geographic predictions as ccsm3 as we increased sample size full model auc decreased slightly however mean auc increased slightly initially fig 2 again both measures of omission rates decreased as we increased sample sizes fig 2 when using the full dataset auc values for both measures were about the same and the omission rates were slightly higher than samples sizes within a similar range fig 2 lastly as sample size increased similarities in geography increased within datasets and between each dataset and the maximum set 3000 occurrence records fig 3 similarly to the ccsm3 variables as we increased the sample size the distribution of means for each dataset narrowed around the mean value of the full dataset sfig 1 c d 4 discussion 4 1 comparisons among datasets several studies have documented the minimum number of occurrence records needed for enms papeş and gaubert 2007 proosdij et al 2016 stockwell and peterson 2002 wisz et al 2008 with pearson et al 2007 developing a test of significance when modeling with a small number of localities however there are almost no recommendations or guidelines for modeling species with large distributions and many occurrence records when using many localities users could be limiting the availability of background localities leading to a hindrance in model performance and predictive accuracy stockwell and peterson 2002 vanderwal et al 2009 additionally issues with the input occurrence data sampling bias and georeferencing errors may be amplified as sample size increases negatively affecting enm results beck et al 2014 bloom et al 2018 boria et al 2014 here we show that for a species with many occurrence records using a smaller dataset can produce very similar models figs 1 and 2 for peromyscus maniculatus we get similar performing models both in geography and with evaluation statistics once a threshold number of localities has been exceeded while the exact number of optimal localities varies in general as few as 10 20 of the maximum number of localities for each climate dataset seems sufficient figs 1 3 further when using the full spatially filtered dataset for both climate sets model performance does not increase and in most instances performs worse than similarly sized samples interestingly we generally see a slight decrease in both measures of auc model discriminatory ability as sample size increases figs 1 and 2 which is most likely due to the increased number of occurrence records making it more difficult for the models to distinguish between presence and background localities lobo et al 2008 vanderwal et al 2009 for species with a large number of localities researchers may want to use a smaller number of georeferenced and spatially filtered occurrence records when fitting enms because as shown here performance and predictions robustness does not substantially increase finally maxent models with larger sample sizes are necessarily more complex and could potentially be more difficult to transfer across space and time boria et al 2017 whereas the maximum number of localities to employ generally goes unaccounted for in ecological niche modeling the current results support using a smaller number of georeferenced localities assuming the minimum standards are met indeed our results suggest that subsampling is ideal since model performance is generally worse for the full dataset with a large number of localities we recommend that researchers modeling broadly distributed species use multiple occurrence datasets to determine if similar patterns occur within their system researchers could also try experimenting with higher numbers of background localities if possible to determine the effects on evaluation statistics vanderwal et al 2009 the ideal would be to use a minimum number of occurrence records that can be correctly and reasonably georeferenced one of the often overlooked aspects of enms bloom et al 2018 while retaining

increasing number of high dams being put into operation huge changes have happened in the process of natural flood in order to maintain the ecological function of flood sometimes hydropower stations have to make artificial flood peak by the power station s spillway discharging water discharge from high dams leads to the supersaturation of total dissolved gas tdg thus causing fish to suffer from

is a flow phenomenon of water level rising rapidly due to some natural factors such as rainstorm playing a fundamental role in the functioning of river ecosystems wydoski and wick 2011 the flood will significantly affect the habitat quality of fish and macroinvertebrates in the downstream river channel pollard and hannan 1994 mannes et al 2009 and change the abiotic and biotic components of river ecosystems hajdukiewicz et al 2018 sometimes the flood will bring some ecological effect to the river ecosystem robinson and minshall 1998 found that benthic macroinvertebrates had evolved life cycles acclimating to predictable seasonal floods the three gorges hydropower station had also attempted to stimulate the spawning of fish in the lower reaches of the yangtze river via artificial flood peaks tao et al 2017 some coastal wetlands also use floodwater as a source of water to operate its ecosystems cai et al 2011 wang et al 2014 javaheri and babbar sebens 2014 due to the flood s characteristics of large flow and rapid flow rate a large amount of nutrients upstream can be carried to feed downstream aquatic organisms balcombe et al 2015 in addition as the downstream water level rise up during the flood the riparian zones are inundated by flood flow and then become the bottomland within a certain period of time under this circumstance the aquatic ecosystems and terrestrial ecosystems are connected the relationship between microorganisms and invertebrates is changed and the biological diversity of the system also becomes more abundant quirino et al 2017 lemke et al 2017 meanwhile the flood brings the food organisms to the bottomland after which fishes follow the floodwater to the bottomland and then complete their important life activities such as spawning and fattening bolland et al 2015 the riparian zones are always brimful of vegetation when floodwater covers the riparian zones the flowing of submerged areas is affected by vegetation under the water and hence becomes complex some scholars have found that the existence of vegetation can change the distribution of flow velocity huai et al 2012 yang et al 2017 increase the longitudinal dispersion coefficient of the channel li et al 2015 and affect the development of turbulent energy of flow serio et al 2017 and the calibration of the kinetic energy and momentum correction coefficients hamidifar et al 2016 simultaneously the absence of vegetation can also increase the resistance dijk et al 2013 and shear stress yang et al 2015 of the riverbed change the transport characteristics of sediment and other materials in water okamoto et al 2012 liu and nepf 2016 shi et al 2016 and gather a host of nutrients near the vegetation and then attract fish to the beach nowadays however due to the massive construction of high dams most of the floods are generated by the power station s spillway operation sordo ward et al 2013 chaleeraktrakoon and chinsomboon 2015 talukdar and pal 2017 during the period of discharge a large amount of air is entrained into water and the supersaturation of total dissolved gas tdg occurs under very high pressure in the plunge pool weitkamp 2000 li et al 2009 the produced tdg supersaturation is not only difficult to dissipate into the atmosphere in a short time but can also be transported and diffused over great distances along the downstream river feng et al 2014a kamal et al 2016 consequently resulting in fish mortality caused by gas bubble disease gdb weitkamp et al 2003 wang et al 2017 if the river water downstream of the spill discharge is used as the water intake source for fish ponds or proliferation stations beside the river or taken for artificial water replenishment to wetlands it can also make a great impact on the ecological environment boyd et al 1994 since hydropower stations must inevitably exclude excessive flood for safety it is of great theoretical value and practical significance to carry out studies of mitigation measures to accelerate the dissipation process of tdg remitting the negative effects of supersaturated tdg on aquatic organisms remitting the negative effects of supersaturated tdg can be achieved by reducing the generation and accelerating the dissipation of tdg some scholars have carried out the field observation finding that the discharge flow the water depth of nappe entry and the design of stilling pool are critical factors affecting the generation of tdg pickett et al 2004 li et al 2009 others have discussed the generation and distribution of tdg by means of numerical model urban et al 2008 politano et al 2009 2017 ma et al 2016a witt et al 2017a moreover many scholars have done a multitude of research on measures of reducing the generation of supersaturated tdg orlins and gulliver 2000 found that installed flow deflectors on the face of the spillway in the wanapum dam could effectively prevent generating high tdg supersaturation politano et al 2012 proposed a better combination of drainage methods which was through concentrating most of the flow in a central spillway bay and use of a western bay if additional water needs to be spilled feng et al 2014b suggested a regulation scheme that adopted an interval discharge pattern instead of a continuous discharge pattern in the upstream power station and used a surface tunnel rather than a bottom tunnel as a dissipation structure for the downstream power station ma et al 2016b indicated that the temporal duration of tdg levels in the river which increased with the increase of discharge time was a major factor in determining the negative effects of tdg on fish therefore intermittent discharge was advised witt et al 2017b hold the view that releasing spillway flows at different time periods not only reduced tdg supersaturation but also met hydropower generation requirements based on field observation feng et al 2017 suggested a ski jump energy dissipation method rather than under flow or surface flow hydraulic energy dissipation methods because the former was more effective in dissipating energy and required shallower water in the stilling basin in addition to resulting in a lower tdg level downstream of the spillway structure in general however even if the height of dam is no more than 100 m the tdg supersaturation caused by the spillway is generally greater than 120 according to the field observation and numerical simulation results feng et al 2014a it is far beyond the limitation standard of 110 for tdg saturation established by the united states environmental protection agency in their water quality criteria wqc usepa 1986 so how to accelerate the dissipation of tdg had been the key research recently li et al 2013 hold the opinion if turbulence in supersaturated river reaches was increased or the water depth was decreased the rate of tdg dissipation would be increased and the river reach length affected by supersaturated tdg would be reduced niu et al 2015 studied the promotion effect on the dissipation of the supersaturated tdg by the use of activated carbon huang et al 2016 discovered that wind could increase the dissipation coefficient of supersaturated tdg ou et al found that improving water temperature 2016a and aerating in the water 2016b could accelerate the dissipation of supersaturated tdg effectively besides taking advantage of the low tdg saturation of tributaries shen et al 2016 proposed an innovative approach involving constructing resistance obstacles or building small dams to expand the suitable shelter areas with low tdg supersaturation levels for fish at the confluence the previous research about the dissipation model of supersaturated tdg has generally considered the influence of flow characteristics or included the influence of water temperature and wind speed partly none of which has taken the effect of solid medium in water into account gas dissolved in water will be adsorbed onto the hydrophobic wall to form bubbles attard 2003 hampton et al 2008 when floodplain is flooded the submerged vegetation becomes solid mediums which will adsorb the supersaturated tdg in water therefore it is necessary to predict the tdg dissipation process including the effect of solid media in water in this paper experiments are conducted to explore the effect of different distribution and characteristics of vegetation on the dissipation of tdg in static water focusing on the quantitative relation between the tdg dissipation rate and solid liquid interface the model with its consideration of the impact of vegetation can effectively improve the accuracy of prediction of tdg transport and dissipation downstream high dam spilling and can provide an innovative approach to mitigating the negative impact of supersaturated tdg 2 materials and method the existing studies about the dissipation process of supersaturated tdg merely consider the bubble liquid mass transfer and air water surface mass transfer while the influence of wall adsorption has not been fully examined actually the dissipation of supersaturated tdg in water should be generalized into three parts shown in fig 1 including bubble liquid mass transfer air water surface mass transfer and wall adsorption during the discharge period supersaturated tdg water inundates the vegetation on bottomlands the submerged vegetation could provide many walls which adsorb the tdg and then accelerate the dissipation of supersaturated tdg so exploring the influence of vegetation s wall adsorption on the dissipation process of supersaturated tdg should be taken into account this paper has designed a series of experiments one experimental case is blank test without vegetation and other experimental cases are sampling tests with vegetation under the same experimental conditions the dissipation of supersaturated tdg caused only through vegetation s wall adsorption could be obtained by deducting the dissipation of supersaturated tdg in blank test from the dissipation of supersaturated tdg in sampling test 2 1 model the university of washington believes that the dissipation process of supersaturated tdg is submitted to the first order kinetics reaction pickett et al 2004 the model is 1 d g g e q d t k t g g e q 2 k t d g d t where t is the dissipation time h g is the tdg saturation at time t g e q is the equilibrium tdg saturation and is assumed to be 100 and k t is the dissipation coefficient h 1 referring to the first order kinetics reaction matlab software is employed to fit the tdg dissipation equations of all experimental cases this paper uses the reduction of tdg concentration replaces the dissipation of tdg and then converts tdg saturation to tdg concentration then the tdg dissipation equation is transformed into the tdg concentration equation the quantitative relation between the reduction of tdg concentration and vegetation s wall adsorption can be achieved by mathematically analyzing the tdg concentration equations of all experimental cases 2 2 experimental studies the device used for the experiment is shown in fig 2 the experimental device includes a series of rectangular plexiglas tanks 0 25 m in length 0 25 m in width and 0 4 m in height at the beginning of the experiment artificial plants are implanted in the tanks to act as vegetation the material of the artificial plants is polyvinyl chloride pvc and the superficial area of a single artificial plant is 0 074 m2 to compare the adsorption effects of vegetation of different materials on the supersaturated tdg another kind of material plexiglas sheets pmma is also implanted into the tank as vegetation the superficial area of a piece of plexiglas sheet is also 0 074 m2 the surface of the artificial plants looks rougher than that of the plexiglas sheets the vegetation s superficial area contained in a unit volume of water is defined as the vegetation density d a m 1 as follows 3 d a a v where a is vegetation superficial area m2 v is the volume of water m3 eight cases of four d a values and two materials artificial plants and plexiglas sheets are created respectively and a blank case is prepared at the same time the cases are listed in table 1 where case 1 is the blank case without vegetation case 2 to case 5 are experimental cases with artificial plants and case 6 to case 9 are experimental cases with plexiglas sheets experiments in the 9 cases were conducted simultaneously at the beginning of the experiment the same supersaturated tdg water was drained into the nine plexiglas tanks each with a volume of 22 5 l the variation of the supersaturated tdg level in the nine experimental tanks was then monitored the supersaturated tdg water was generated by the supersaturated tdg generation system developed by sichuan university china li et al 2010 in which the outflow rate could reach up to 10 l s 1 and the resulting supersaturated tdg level could be as high as 170 the tdg saturation level in the water was measured with a tgp total dissolved gas pressure detector made from point four tgp portable trackers made by pentair california in the u s for which the measuring range of tgp is 0 200 and the accuracy is 2 the tgp detector could also be used to measure water temperature within a measuring range of 0 40 c with an accuracy of 1 c the water temperature in the experimental tanks was kept at 23 1 0 c during the whole experiment process 3 results 3 1 experimental results the dissipation processes of supersaturated tdg of all cases are shown in fig 3 the dissipation curves demonstrated that the tdg saturation levels gradually decreased over time a comparison between case 1 without vegetation and other cases with vegetation indicated that planting vegetation in the water could effectively promote the dissipation of supersaturated tdg as a prior investigation has shown this might be because increasing the amount of medium in water could accelerate the dissipation of supersaturated tdg according to thermodynamic theory about the precipitation of dissolved gas the process of precipitation of dissolved gas should be divided into four steps to begin with a small amount of dissolved gas forms into a gas nucleus then the dissolved gas around the gas nucleus attaches to it to generate a minute bubble furthermore the minute bubble gradually grows into a gross bubble under the effects of pressure buoyancy and bubble liquid mass transfer finally the gross bubble comes out of the water through air water surface mass transfer the increasing of medium in water such as sand artificial bubbles and activated carbon could provide a big advantage for forming gas nuclei so the existence of artificial plants and plexiglas sheets in the test tanks boosted the dissipation of the supersaturated tdg in the water defining the ratio between the tdg reduction and the dissipation time from the beginning to the end as the average dissipation rate v min 1 is shown as follows 4 v g 1 g 2 t where g 1 is the starting tdg saturation g 2 is the terminal tdg saturation and t is the dissipation time min the average dissipation rate v of each case was calculated respectively shown in table 2 comparing the cases with the same d a the research has found that the v of case 2 artificial plants d a 26 3 m 1 was 1 20 times higher than that of case 6 plexiglas sheets d a 26 3 m 1 the v of case 3 artificial plants d a 39 5 m 1 was 1 14 times higher than that of case 7 plexiglas sheets d a 39 5 m 1 the v for case 4 artificial plants d a 52 6 m 1 was 1 16 times higher than that of case 8 plexiglas sheets d a 52 6 m 1 and the v for case 5 artificial plants d a 65 8 m 1 was 1 13 times higher than that of case 9 plexiglas sheets d a 65 8 m 1 this phenomenon indicated that the average dissipation rates of the supersaturated tdg in different cases with the same vegetation densities but different vegetation types were different the promotion effect of artificial plants on the dissipation of supersaturated tdg was better than that of plexiglas sheets the reason behind this phenomenon was that the rougher the vegetation s wall was the faster the supersaturated tdg was dissipated the wall of artificial plants was rougher than that of plexiglas sheets it was also obvious that as the vegetation density increased the dissipation rate of the supersaturated tdg became faster according to the data from the experiments with artificial plants case 2 to case 5 the same trend could be seen in experiments with plexiglas sheets case 6 to case 9 with analysis of the dissipation curves of nine cases it could be found that all of the dissipation curves presented a tendency of becoming falter in the incipient stage about the first two hours of the experiments the reductions of tdg saturation were 25 43 46 51 53 34 40 44 47 for case 1 to case 9 respectively it was evident that in the incipient stage the dissipation rates of the supersaturated tdg were very fast and the dissipation curves were very sharp the presence of more vegetation produced steeper curve and the curves of the experiments with artificial plants case 2 to case 5 were sharper than those with plexiglas sheets case 6 to case 9 nonetheless the curves of all cases flattened out over time in the later on stage after approximately two hours in the experiments the reductions in the tdg saturation was just 17 17 15 11 10 20 18 16 and 15 for case 1 to case 9 respectively the average dissipation rates in the two states of all cases are shown in table 3 the reason for this trend is that at the beginning large amount of tdg separated out of the water is adsorbed onto the surface of the tanks and the vegetation s walls then forming bubbles as shown in fig 4 in this process the adsorption effect of the vegetation s walls on the supersaturated tdg played a dominate role with more and more bubbles forming the area of the vegetation s walls became relatively less and less resulting in a decrease of the dissipation rate of the supersaturated tdg along with flattening dissipation curves 3 2 theoretical analysis results 3 2 1 fitting the dissipation processes of supersaturated tdg according to the results of all experimental cases the first order kinetics reaction mentioned in 2 1 was adopted to fit the dissipation process of supersaturated tdg the fitting equations were obtained as the following eqs 5 and 6 and the fitting lines of all experimental cases are shown in fig 5 5 g g e q g 0 g e q e λ t 6 λ d g d t where t is the dissipation time min g 0 is the initial tdg saturation and is measured to be 164 in this paper and λ is the dissipation coefficient min 1 which has the same physical meaning with the k t mentioned in eq 2 g g eq is defined as the excess tdg saturation the fitting results of all experimental cases are shown in table 4 an obvious positive relationship between the dissipation coefficient λ and the vegetation density d a revealed that the higher the vegetation density d a was the larger the dissipation coefficient λ was in experimental cases with the same vegetation types 3 2 2 investigation of the quantitative relation between the reduction of tdg concentration and vegetation s wall adsorption converting tdg saturation to tdg concentration was shown in eqs 7 9 7 c c s g 8 c 0 c s g 0 9 c e q c s g e q c s where c is the corresponding momentary tdg concentration mg l 1 c 0 is the initial tdg concentration mg l 1 c e q is the equilibrium tdg concentration mg l 1 and c s s the air solubility under the same temperature and pressure conditions mg l 1 combining eq 5 with eqs 7 9 a relational expression eq 10 was achieved as follows 10 c c 0 c e q e λ t c e q taking the derivative and discreteness of eq 10 the variation of the tdg concentration over a unit time was gained as the following eq 11 shows 11 δ c δ t λ c c e q where δ t is the temporal variation from an arbitrary moment to the next moment min and δ c is the variation of the tdg concentration during δ t mg l 1 for the supersaturated tdg water with the same concentration c the variation of the tdg concentration for the case without vegetation δ c b mg l 1 was 12 δ c b δ t λ b c c e q and the variation of the tdg concentration for cases with vegetation δ c s mg l 1 was 13 δ c s δ t λ s c c e q where λ b is the corresponding dissipation coefficient of the tdg for the case without vegetation min 1 and λ s is the corresponding dissipation coefficient of the tdg for cases with vegetation min 1 according to the sketch of the dissipation of supersaturated tdg mentioned in case 1 without vegetation the dissipation of the supersaturated tdg occurred through bubble liquid mass transfer air water surface mass transfer and the tank s wall adsorption in addition to the bubble liquid mass transfer air water surface mass transfer and tank s wall adsorption the vegetation s walls also adsorbed the supersaturated tdg in cases with vegetation case 2 to case 9 therefore the variation of the tdg concentration caused only through the vegetation s walls adsorption could be achieved by subtracting the variation of the tdg concentration in the case without vegetation case 1 from the variation of the tdg concentration in the cases with vegetation case 2 to case 9 the concentration variation of the tdg caused solely through the vegetation s wall adsorption δ c w mg l 1 was shown in eq 14 14 δ c w δ c e δ c b δ t c c e q λ s λ b the absolute value of δ c w was exactly the vegetation s adsorbent concentration namely δ c a as follows 15 δ c a δ c w δ t c c e q λ s λ b for eq 15 when δ t approached 0 the equation would be 16 d c a d t δ t 0 δ c a δ t c c e q λ s λ b performing integrals over t of both the left side and right side of eq 16 simultaneously yielded the relationship between the tdg concentration adsorbed by the vegetation s wall and the dissipation time t shown in the eq 17 as below 17 c a c c e q λ s λ b t to investigate the quantitative relationship between the reduction of tdg concentration and the area of the vegetation s wall f a mg l 1 m 2 min 1 was defined as the adsorption flux of tdg adsorbed by a unit area over a unit time the left side and right side of eq 16 divided by the surface area of vegetation s wall produced the following eq 18 18 f a d c a a d t λ s λ b a c c e q defining k a m 2 min 1 shown in eq 19 as the adsorption rate of the wall the expression of f a is achieved as eq 20 shows 19 k a λ s λ b a 20 f a k a c c e q the adsorption rates k a of eight cases case 2 to case 9 are shown in table 5 it could be seen that different types of vegetation produced different adsorption rates for experimental cases with the same types of vegetation the adsorption rates were about the same the adsorption rate k a of artificial plants pvc was near 0 0095 m 2 min 1 while that of plexiglas sheets pmma was 0 0046 m 2 min 1 this indicated that the vegetation s material and surface characteristics were influential factors which affect the vegetation s wall adsorption effect on the dissolved gas the results of this paper could help to have a better understanding of vegetation s wall adsorption in prediction models of the dissipation of supersaturated tdg in the future what needs to be further explored is the determination of the adsorption rate of the main vegetation through experiments and simulations 4 discussion 4 1 experimental uncertainties analysis generally speaking there exist some uncertainties in the experiment firstly in order to exclude the errors caused by different amounts of water the volume of water in all experimental tanks is the same 20 4 l for the artificial plants testing group the variation of water depth is negligible due to the small size of the artificial plant itself as a plexiglas sheet occupies a volume of 180cm3 there exist differences in water depths in each experimental case for the plexiglas sheets testing group shown in the following table 6 according to previous studies water depth is an essential factor affecting the dissipation of supersaturated tdg li et al 2013 the difference of water depth in all cases causes a certain error secondly in the experiments point four is an instrument used to measure tdg saturation of water when using this instrument it is necessary to shake the probe to prevent the bubbles attached on the probe s surface it takes about five minutes for the tdg saturation reading to stabilize so the probe should be continuously shaken during the five minutes shaking the probe creates a water wave which can take the bubble attached on the wall near the probe away from the wall causing a certain error to the experiment 4 2 material factors analysis based on the experiment this paper develops certain mechanism analysis about the vegetation s wall adsorption to supersaturated tdg only artificial plants pvc and plexiglas sheets pmma are selected for they are readily available as experimental vegetation from the perspective of vision and tactility the wall of the artificial plants is rougher than that of plexiglas sheets in this sense the roughness of the vegetation s wall is a relatively important factor affecting the vegetation s wall adsorption to supersaturated tdg which is also thought to be the only difference between the two experimental materials apart from the roughness the wall s other properties like hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity porosity surface area also affect the adsorption of supersaturated tdg some scholars proposed that gas dissolved in water would be adsorbed onto the hydrophobic wall to form bubbles and the generation of bubbles is enhanced with the increase of wall s hydrophobicity miller et al 1999 attard 2003 hampton et al 2008 niu et al 2015 found that porous medium like activated carbon could promote the dissipation of the supersaturated tdg through multiple experiments this paper finds that the wall s adsorption rate of the supersaturated tdg is only related to the two materials and the adsorption rate of the same material is basically the same under different vegetation densities therefore what should be considered in research down the road are exploring the main material factors affecting the wall s dissipation of the supersaturated tdg and establishing the quantitative relationship between adsorption coefficient and material factors 5 conclusions in this paper experimental research about the effect of vegetation on supersaturated tdg was conducted via planting artificial plants pvc and plexiglas sheets pmma in tanks the experimental results showed that planting vegetation in water can effectively bolster the dissipation of supersaturated tdg analysis showed that as the density of vegetation increased the dissipation rate of the supersaturated tdg became higher different types of vegetation have different promotion effect on the dissipation process of supersaturated tdg the promoting effect of artificial plants pvc with rougher walls is superior to that of plexiglas sheets pmma with smoother walls during the dissipation process of supersaturated tdg supported by the experimental data this paper proposed a supersaturated tdg dissipation model describing the function of the vegetation s wall adsorption on the tdg the formula for the adsorption flux f a of supersaturated tdg in a unit area over a unit time was attained a significant parameter representing how fast the vegetation s surfaces adsorbed the supersaturated tdg namely the adsorption rate k a was obtained it was determined that k a is only related to the vegetation s material and surface characteristics in this study the mean adsorption rate of artificial plant pvc cases was 0 0095 m 2 min 1 while average adsorption rate of the plexiglas sheet pmma cases was 0 0046 m 2 min 1 the paper provided a crucial parameter determination method for improving the prediction model of supersaturated tdg dissipation with vegetation which is of great significance for studying mitigation measures of protecting aquatic organisms and quantitively evaluating the efficiency of the measures in the next phase of study it is necessary to determine the adsorption coefficients of vegetation with different characteristics and examine the quantitative influence of material properties hydrophilic or hydrophobic and surface features quantitative roughness besides doing some related work about vegetation impact on tdg dissipation in flow water is desirable the database of the adsorption rate k a should be built and the quantitative relation between the k a and the key material factors should be established to complement the model acknowledgment this work was supported

supersaturation but also met hydropower generation requirements based on field observation feng et al 2017 suggested a ski jump energy dissipation method rather than under flow or surface flow hydraulic energy dissipation methods because the former was more effective in dissipating energy and required shallower water in the stilling basin in addition to resulting in a lower tdg level downstream of the spillway structure in general however even if the height of dam is no more than 100 m the tdg supersaturation caused by the spillway is generally greater than 120 according to the field observation and numerical simulation results feng et al 2014a it is far beyond the limitation standard of 110 for tdg saturation established by the united states environmental protection agency in their water quality criteria wqc usepa 1986 so how to accelerate the dissipation of tdg had been the key research recently li et al 2013 hold the opinion if turbulence in supersaturated river reaches was increased or the water depth was decreased the rate of tdg dissipation would be increased and the river reach length affected by supersaturated tdg would be reduced niu et al 2015 studied the promotion effect on the dissipation of the supersaturated tdg by the use of activated carbon huang et al 2016 discovered that wind could increase the dissipation coefficient of supersaturated tdg ou et al found that improving water temperature 2016a and aerating in the water 2016b could accelerate the dissipation of supersaturated tdg effectively besides taking advantage of the low tdg saturation of tributaries shen et al 2016 proposed an innovative approach involving constructing resistance obstacles or building small dams to expand the suitable shelter areas with low tdg supersaturation levels for fish at the confluence the previous research about the dissipation model of supersaturated tdg has generally considered the influence of flow characteristics or included the influence of water temperature and wind speed partly none of which has taken the effect of solid medium in water into account gas dissolved in water will be adsorbed onto the hydrophobic wall to form bubbles attard 2003 hampton et al 2008 when floodplain is flooded the submerged vegetation becomes solid mediums which will adsorb the supersaturated tdg in water therefore it is necessary to predict the tdg dissipation process including the effect of solid media in water in this paper experiments are conducted to explore the effect of different distribution and characteristics of vegetation on the dissipation of tdg in static water focusing on the quantitative relation between the tdg dissipation rate and solid liquid interface the model with its consideration of the impact of vegetation can effectively improve the accuracy of prediction of tdg transport and dissipation downstream high dam spilling and can provide an innovative approach to mitigating the negative impact of supersaturated tdg 2 materials and method the existing studies about the dissipation process of supersaturated tdg merely consider the bubble liquid mass transfer and air water surface mass transfer while the influence of wall adsorption has not been fully examined actually the dissipation of supersaturated tdg in water should be generalized into three parts shown in fig 1 including bubble liquid mass transfer air water surface mass transfer and wall adsorption during the discharge period supersaturated tdg water inundates the vegetation on bottomlands the submerged vegetation could provide many walls which adsorb the tdg and then accelerate the dissipation of supersaturated tdg so exploring the influence of vegetation s wall adsorption on the dissipation process of supersaturated tdg should be taken into account this paper has designed a series of experiments one experimental case is blank test without vegetation and other experimental cases are sampling tests with vegetation under the same experimental conditions the dissipation of supersaturated tdg caused only through vegetation s wall adsorption could be obtained by deducting the dissipation of supersaturated tdg in blank test from the dissipation of supersaturated tdg in sampling test 2 1 model the university of washington believes that the dissipation process of supersaturated tdg is submitted to the first order kinetics reaction pickett et al 2004 the model is 1 d g g e q d t k t g g e q 2 k t d g d t where t is the dissipation time h g is the tdg saturation at time t g e q is the equilibrium tdg saturation and is assumed to be 100 and k t is the dissipation coefficient h 1 referring to the first order kinetics reaction matlab software is employed to fit the tdg dissipation equations of all experimental cases this paper uses the reduction of tdg concentration replaces the dissipation of tdg and then converts tdg saturation to tdg concentration then the tdg dissipation equation is transformed into the tdg concentration equation the quantitative relation between the reduction of tdg concentration and vegetation s wall adsorption can be achieved by mathematically analyzing the tdg concentration equations of all experimental cases 2 2 experimental studies the device used for the experiment is shown in fig 2 the experimental device includes a series of rectangular plexiglas tanks 0 25 m in length 0 25 m in width and 0 4 m in height at the beginning of the experiment artificial plants are implanted in the tanks to act as vegetation the material of the artificial plants is polyvinyl chloride pvc and the superficial area of a single artificial plant is 0 074 m2 to compare the adsorption effects of vegetation of different materials on the supersaturated tdg another kind of material plexiglas sheets pmma is also implanted into the tank as vegetation the superficial area of a piece of plexiglas sheet is also 0 074 m2 the surface of the artificial plants looks rougher than that of the plexiglas sheets the vegetation s superficial area contained in a unit volume of water is defined as the vegetation density d a m 1 as follows 3 d a a v where a is vegetation superficial area m2 v is the volume of water m3 eight cases of four d a values and two materials artificial plants and plexiglas sheets are created respectively and a blank case is prepared at the same time the cases are listed in table 1 where case 1 is the blank case without vegetation case 2 to case 5 are experimental cases with artificial plants and case 6 to case 9 are experimental cases with plexiglas sheets experiments in the 9 cases were conducted simultaneously at the beginning of the experiment the same supersaturated tdg water was drained into the nine plexiglas tanks each with a volume of 22 5 l the variation of the supersaturated tdg level in the nine experimental tanks was then monitored the supersaturated tdg water was generated by the supersaturated tdg generation system developed by sichuan university china li et al 2010 in which the outflow rate could reach up to 10 l s 1 and the resulting supersaturated tdg level could be as high as 170 the tdg saturation level in the water was measured with a tgp total dissolved gas pressure detector made from point four tgp portable trackers made by pentair california in the u s for which the measuring range of tgp is 0 200 and the accuracy is 2 the tgp detector could also be used to measure water temperature within a measuring range of 0 40 c with an accuracy of 1 c the water temperature in the experimental tanks was kept at 23 1 0 c during the whole experiment process 3 results 3 1 experimental results the dissipation processes of supersaturated tdg of all cases are shown in fig 3 the dissipation curves demonstrated that the tdg saturation levels gradually decreased over time a comparison between case 1 without vegetation and other cases with vegetation indicated that planting vegetation in the water could effectively promote the dissipation of supersaturated tdg as a prior investigation has shown this might be because increasing the amount of medium in water could accelerate the dissipation of supersaturated tdg according to thermodynamic theory about the precipitation of dissolved gas the process of precipitation of dissolved gas should be divided into four steps to begin with a small amount of dissolved gas forms into a gas nucleus then the dissolved gas around the gas nucleus attaches to it to generate a minute bubble furthermore the minute bubble gradually grows into a gross bubble under the effects of pressure buoyancy and bubble liquid mass transfer finally the gross bubble comes out of the water through air water surface mass transfer the increasing of medium in water such as sand artificial bubbles and activated carbon could provide a big advantage for forming gas nuclei so the existence of artificial plants and plexiglas sheets in the test tanks boosted the dissipation of the supersaturated tdg in the water defining the ratio between the tdg reduction and the dissipation time from the beginning to the end as the average dissipation rate v min 1 is shown as follows 4 v g 1 g 2 t where g 1 is the starting tdg saturation g 2 is the terminal tdg saturation and t is the dissipation time min the average dissipation rate v of each case was calculated respectively shown in table 2 comparing the cases with the same d a the research has found that the v of case 2 artificial plants d a 26 3 m 1 was 1 20 times higher than that of case 6 plexiglas sheets d a 26 3 m 1 the v of case 3 artificial plants d a 39 5 m 1 was 1 14 times higher than that of case 7 plexiglas sheets d a 39 5 m 1 the v for case 4 artificial plants d a 52 6 m 1 was 1 16 times higher than that of case 8 plexiglas sheets d a 52 6 m 1 and the v for case 5 artificial plants d a 65 8 m 1 was 1 13 times higher than that of case 9 plexiglas sheets d a 65 8 m 1 this phenomenon indicated that the average dissipation rates of the supersaturated tdg in different cases with the same vegetation densities but different vegetation types were different the promotion effect of artificial plants on the dissipation of supersaturated tdg was better than that of plexiglas sheets the reason behind this phenomenon was that the rougher the vegetation s wall was the faster the supersaturated tdg was dissipated the wall of artificial plants was rougher than that of plexiglas sheets it was also obvious that as the vegetation density increased the dissipation rate of the supersaturated tdg became faster according to the data from the experiments with artificial plants case 2 to case 5 the same trend could be seen in experiments with plexiglas sheets case 6 to case 9 with analysis of the dissipation curves of nine cases it could be found that all of the dissipation curves presented a tendency of becoming falter in the incipient stage about the first two hours of the experiments the reductions of tdg saturation were 25 43 46 51 53 34 40 44 47 for case 1 to case 9 respectively it was evident that in the incipient stage the dissipation rates of the supersaturated tdg were very fast and the dissipation curves were very sharp the presence of more vegetation produced steeper curve and the curves of the experiments with artificial plants case 2 to case 5 were sharper than those with plexiglas sheets case 6 to case 9 nonetheless the curves of all cases flattened out over time in the later on stage after approximately two hours in the experiments the reductions in the tdg saturation was just 17 17 15 11 10 20 18 16 and 15 for case 1 to case 9 respectively the average dissipation rates in the two states of all cases are shown in table 3 the reason for this trend is that at the beginning large amount of tdg separated out of the water is adsorbed onto the surface of the tanks and the vegetation s walls then forming bubbles as shown in fig 4 in this process the adsorption effect of the vegetation s walls on the supersaturated tdg played a dominate role with more and more bubbles forming the area of the vegetation s walls became relatively less and less resulting in a decrease of the dissipation rate of the supersaturated tdg along with flattening dissipation curves 3 2 theoretical analysis results 3 2 1 fitting the dissipation processes of supersaturated tdg according to the results of all experimental cases the first order kinetics reaction mentioned in 2 1 was adopted to fit the dissipation process of supersaturated tdg the fitting equations were obtained as the following eqs 5 and 6 and the fitting lines of all experimental cases are shown in fig 5 5 g g e q g 0 g e q e λ t 6 λ d g d t where t is the dissipation time min g 0 is the initial tdg saturation and is measured to be 164 in this paper and λ is the dissipation coefficient min 1 which has the same physical meaning with the k t mentioned in eq 2 g g eq is defined as the excess tdg saturation the fitting results of all experimental cases are shown in table 4 an obvious positive relationship between the dissipation coefficient λ and the vegetation density d a revealed that the higher the vegetation density d a was the larger the dissipation coefficient λ was in experimental cases with the same vegetation types 3 2 2 investigation of the quantitative relation between the reduction of tdg concentration and vegetation s wall adsorption converting tdg saturation to tdg concentration was shown in eqs 7 9 7 c c s g 8 c 0 c s g 0 9 c e q c s g e q c s where c is the corresponding momentary tdg concentration mg l 1 c 0 is the initial tdg concentration mg l 1 c e q is the equilibrium tdg concentration mg l 1 and c s s the air solubility under the same temperature and pressure conditions mg l 1 combining eq 5 with eqs 7 9 a relational expression eq 10 was achieved as follows 10 c c 0 c e q e λ t c e q taking the derivative and discreteness of eq 10 the variation of the tdg concentration over a unit time was gained as the following eq 11 shows 11 δ c δ t λ c c e q where δ t is the temporal variation from an arbitrary moment to the next moment min and δ c is the variation of the tdg concentration during δ t mg l 1 for the supersaturated tdg water with the same concentration c the variation of the tdg concentration for the case without vegetation δ c b mg l 1 was 12 δ c b δ t λ b c c e q and the variation of the tdg concentration for cases with vegetation δ c s mg l 1 was 13 δ c s δ t λ s c c e q where λ b is the corresponding dissipation coefficient of the tdg for the case without vegetation min 1 and λ s is the corresponding dissipation coefficient of the tdg for cases with vegetation min 1 according to the sketch of the dissipation of supersaturated tdg mentioned in case 1 without vegetation the dissipation of the supersaturated tdg occurred through bubble liquid mass transfer air water surface mass transfer and the tank s wall adsorption in addition to the bubble liquid mass transfer air water surface mass transfer and tank s wall adsorption the vegetation s walls also adsorbed the supersaturated tdg in cases with vegetation case 2 to case 9 therefore the variation of the tdg concentration caused only through the vegetation s walls adsorption could be achieved by subtracting the variation of the tdg concentration in the case without vegetation case 1 from the variation of the tdg concentration in the cases with vegetation case 2 to case 9 the concentration variation of the tdg caused solely through the vegetation s wall adsorption δ c w mg l 1 was shown in eq 14 14 δ c w δ c e δ c b δ t c c e q λ s λ b the absolute value of δ c w was exactly the vegetation s adsorbent concentration namely δ c a as follows 15 δ c a δ c w δ t c c e q λ s λ b for eq 15 when δ t approached 0 the equation would be 16 d c a d t δ t 0 δ c a δ t c c e q λ s λ b performing integrals over t of both the left side and right side of eq 16 simultaneously yielded the relationship between the tdg concentration adsorbed by the vegetation s wall and the dissipation time t shown in the eq 17 as below 17 c a c c e q λ s λ b t to investigate the quantitative relationship between the reduction of tdg concentration and the area of the vegetation s wall f a mg l 1 m 2 min 1 was defined as the adsorption flux of tdg adsorbed by a unit area over a unit time the left side and right side of eq 16 divided by the surface area of vegetation s wall produced the following eq 18 18 f a d c a a d t λ s λ b a c c e q defining k a m 2 min 1 shown in eq 19 as the adsorption rate of the wall the expression of f a is achieved as eq 20 shows 19 k a λ s λ b a 20 f a k a c c e q the adsorption rates k a of eight cases case 2 to case 9 are shown in table 5 it could be seen that different types of vegetation produced different adsorption rates for experimental cases with the same types of vegetation the adsorption rates were about the same the adsorption rate k a of artificial plants pvc was near 0 0095 m 2 min 1 while that of plexiglas sheets pmma was 0 0046 m 2 min 1 this indicated that the vegetation s material and surface characteristics were influential factors which affect the vegetation s wall adsorption effect on the dissolved gas the results of this paper could help to have a better understanding of vegetation s wall adsorption in prediction models of the dissipation of supersaturated tdg in the future what needs to be further explored is the determination of the adsorption rate of the main vegetation through experiments and simulations 4 discussion 4 1 experimental uncertainties analysis generally speaking there exist some uncertainties in the experiment firstly in order to exclude the errors caused by different amounts of water the volume of water in all experimental tanks is the same 20 4 l for the artificial plants testing group the variation of water depth is negligible due to the small size of the artificial plant itself as a plexiglas sheet occupies a volume of 180cm3 there exist differences in water depths in each experimental case for the plexiglas sheets testing group shown in the following table 6 according to previous studies water depth is an essential factor affecting the dissipation of supersaturated tdg li et al 2013 the difference of water depth in all cases causes a certain error secondly in the experiments point four is an instrument used to measure tdg saturation of water when using this instrument it is necessary to shake the probe to prevent the bubbles attached on the probe s surface it takes about five minutes for the tdg saturation reading to stabilize so the probe should be continuously shaken during the five minutes shaking the probe creates a water wave which can take the bubble attached on the wall near the probe away from the wall causing a certain error to the experiment 4 2 material factors analysis based on the experiment this paper develops certain mechanism analysis about the vegetation s wall adsorption to supersaturated tdg only artificial plants pvc and plexiglas sheets pmma are selected for they are readily available as experimental vegetation from the perspective of vision and tactility the wall of the artificial plants is rougher than that of plexiglas sheets in this sense the roughness of the vegetation s wall is a relatively important factor affecting the vegetation s wall adsorption to supersaturated tdg which is also thought to be the only difference between the two experimental materials apart from the roughness the wall s other properties like hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity porosity surface area also affect the adsorption of supersaturated tdg some scholars proposed that gas dissolved in water would be adsorbed onto the hydrophobic wall to form bubbles and the generation of bubbles is enhanced with the increase of wall s hydrophobicity miller et al 1999 attard 2003 hampton et al 2008 niu et al 2015 found that porous medium like activated carbon could promote the dissipation of the supersaturated tdg through multiple experiments this paper finds that the wall s adsorption rate of the supersaturated tdg is only related to the two materials and the adsorption rate of the same material is basically the same under different vegetation densities therefore what should be considered in research down the road are exploring the main material factors affecting the wall s dissipation of the supersaturated tdg and establishing the quantitative relationship between adsorption coefficient and material factors 5 conclusions in this paper experimental research about the effect of vegetation on supersaturated tdg was conducted via planting artificial plants pvc and plexiglas sheets pmma in tanks the experimental results showed that planting vegetation in water can effectively bolster the dissipation of supersaturated tdg analysis showed that as the density of vegetation increased the dissipation rate of the supersaturated tdg became higher different types of vegetation have different promotion effect on the dissipation process of supersaturated tdg the promoting effect of artificial plants pvc with rougher walls is superior to that of plexiglas sheets pmma with smoother walls during the dissipation process of supersaturated tdg supported by the experimental data this paper proposed a supersaturated tdg dissipation model describing the function of the vegetation s wall adsorption on the tdg the formula for the adsorption flux f a of supersaturated tdg in a unit area over a unit time was attained a significant parameter representing how fast the vegetation s surfaces adsorbed the supersaturated tdg namely the adsorption rate k a was obtained it was determined that k a is only related to the vegetation s material and surface characteristics in this study the mean adsorption rate of artificial plant pvc cases was 0 0095 m 2 min 1 while average adsorption rate of the plexiglas sheet pmma cases was 0 0046 m 2 min 1 the paper provided a crucial parameter determination method for improving the prediction model of supersaturated tdg dissipation with vegetation which is of great significance for studying mitigation measures of protecting aquatic organisms and quantitively evaluating the efficiency of the measures in the next phase of study it is necessary to determine the adsorption coefficients of vegetation with different characteristics and examine the quantitative influence of material properties hydrophilic or hydrophobic and surface features quantitative roughness besides doing some related work about vegetation impact on tdg dissipation in flow water is desirable the database of the adsorption rate k a should be built and the quantitative relation between the k a and the key material factors should be established to complement the model acknowledgment this work was supported

25207,ocean acidification oa driven by anthropogenic co2 emissions affects marine ecosystems fisheries and aquaculture assessing the impacts of oa using projection models facilitates the development of future scenarios and potential solutions here we explored various ways to incorporate oa impacts into a multi stressor dynamic bioclimatic envelope model to project biogeographic changes of ten commercially exploited invertebrate species we examine three dimensions of uncertainties in modelling biophysical oa effects model structure parameterization and scenario uncertainty our results show that projected oa impacts are most sensitive to the choice of structural relationship between oa and biological responses followed by the choice of climate change emission scenarios and parameterizations of the size of oa effects species generally showed negative effects to oa but sensitivity to the various sources of uncertainty were not consistent across or within species for example some species showed higher sensitivity to structural uncertainty and very low sensitivity to parameter uncertainty while others showed greatest sensitivity to parameter uncertainty this variability is largely due to geographic variability and difference in life history traits used to parameterize model simulations our model highlights the variability across the sources of uncertainty and contributes to the development of integrating oa impacts in species distribution models we further stress the importance of defining the limitations and assumptions as well as exploring the range of uncertainties associated with modelling oa impacts keywords species distribution dynamic bioclimatic envelope model invertebrate projection model 1 introduction carbon dioxide co2 emissions from human activities such as the burning of fossil fuels largely contributes to the rapid rate of ocean acidification oa since the industrial revolution ipcc 2013 oa is the chemical process driven by elevated atmospheric co2 that results in reduced ph and increased acidity global sea surface ph has already decreased by 0 1 units since the pre industrial average of 8 17 a 26 increase in acidity caldeira and wickett 2003 feely et al 2009 pörtner et al 2014 under our current emissions trajectory sea surface ph is projected to decrease by an additional 0 3 units by the end of the 21st century ciais et al 2013 ipcc 2013 some areas are experiencing much larger changes in ph for example the northeast pacific ocean has naturally fluctuating ph levels due to upwelling and the uptake of

and development among others detailed in le quesne and pinnegar 2012 direct impacts of oa on changes in species abundance will result in important changes to competitive facilitative and trophic relationships dutkiewicz et al 2015 queirós et al 2015 sunday et al 2017 trenkel et al 2005 overall changes in physiology and behaviour lead to changes in growth and abundance and when considered across multiple interacting species results in important changes in community structure and ecosystem function kroeker et al 2013 nagelkerken and connell 2015 oa coincides with other anthropogenic co2 driven stressors including ocean warming and decreases in dissolved oxygen concentration increases in temperature affects physiological processes such as metabolism increasing the demand for oxygen and reducing aerobic scope pörtner and lannig 2009 decreases in oxygen content further exacerbates this effect and is projected to lower the metabolic capacity of marine habitats potentially leading to decreased body size cheung et al 2013a deutsch et al 2015 pauly and cheung 2017 biogeographic responses to ocean warming and decreased oxygen content have been observed as shifts in distributions to deeper and higher latitudinal waters cheung et al 2013b dulvy et al 2008 perry et al 2005 while isolating the effects of oa is important for understanding the mechanisms in which oa effects operate integrating oa with other stressors provides a more real world application of the effects of anthropogenic influenced global changes on species distribution and abundance the inclusion of oa in assessing impacts of anthropogenic co2 emissions is important in developing scenarios of future global change for marine systems published syntheses and meta analyses are extremely useful for providing baseline parameters for modelling and assessing the biological impacts of oa kroeker et al 2013 nagelkerken and connell 2015 sunday et al 2017 they also provide a basis for linking complex physiological responses to life history traits that have direct implications on population dynamics for example cheung et al 2011 incorporated physiological models into a dynamic bioclimatic envelope model cheung et al 2008 to assess climate change effects on species distribution and abundance this model was then applied to a socioeconomic analysis of climate change and oa impacts in the arctic ocean lam et al 2014 empirical models of oa effects have also been used to estimate changes in the growth rates of mollusc species and thereby impacts on us mollusc fisheries moore 2015 ries et al 2009 another promising approach incorporates information about marine food webs by using an ecosystem model to model the impacts of oa on functional groups that include harvested taxa ainsworth et al 2011 projection models provide valuable insight to potential future scenarios but are subject to various sources of uncertainty uncertainty when modelling ocean acidification arises from the choice of model parameterizations which produce a range of possible impact pathways we define three sources of uncertainty when modelling oa impacts 1 structural 2 parameter and 3 scenario uncertainty hawkins and sutton 2009 structural uncertainty refers to the underlying construction of the model such as the mathematical formulation of a model to represent ecological relationships or the processes modelled using correlative versus mechanistic approaches e g pauly et al 2000 parameter uncertainty stems from the inherent variability and our limited ability to accurately and precisely measure biological processes and relationships e g kremer 1983 scenario uncertainty results from the different possible future pathways due to many socioeconomic factors e g governmental policies technological development that affect biophysical drivers this includes the various greenhouse gas concentration trajectories used to drive climate and biophysical models ipcc 2013 the combined uncertainties produce the full range of future trajectories providing valuable insight to the sensitivities of modelling oa impacts in this study we explored various ways to incorporate oa impacts into a multi stressor dynamic bioclimatic envelope model to project changes in the biogeography of ten commercially exploited invertebrate species we examined the structural parameterization and scenario uncertainties in modelling oa effects to eventually improve our confidence in forecasting future scenarios we explored the variability of model outputs and discussed the utilities and limitations of different ways to incorporate oa impacts in spatial biogeographic models 2 methods we incorporated the impacts of oa into a previously developed dynamic bioclimatic envelope model dbem cheung et al 2016a 2011 2008 to estimate changes in species distribution and abundance the dbem uses earth system models as inputs e g dunne et al 2013 and links species distribution models jones et al 2012 advection diffusion movement models sibert et al 1999 growth models pauly 1980 physiological models pauly 1981 and population dynamics models hilborn and walters 1992 o connor et al 2007 pauly 1980 to predict how species will move geographically across time annual time step and space on a 0 5 latitude x 0 5 longitude grid with climate change we outline the specifics of modelling the effects of oa and how it interacts with effects from other stressors i e temperature and oxygen below while other details on the dbem can be found in the supplementary material supplementary fig s1 2 1 modelling the effects of global change global change effects on organisms and populations include changes in temperature oxygen and ph we integrated the biological impacts of oa on exploited populations through the effects on somatic growth and mortality rates we define the effects on somatic growth as a mechanistic process and the effects on survival as a correlative process first the model uses the von bertalanffy growth function von bertalanffy 1951 to simulate changes in growth in response to ocean warming decreases in dissolved oxygen concentration and ocean acidification cheung et al 2011 growth rate change in biomass b as a function of time t is determined with the derived equation from a growth function 1 d b d t h w d k w b where h and k represent the coefficients for anabolism and catabolism respectively anabolism scales with body weight w to the exponent d 1 catabolism scales linearly with w i e b 1 and their difference determines the growth rate of species biomass b solving for db dt 0 when asymptotic weight w is reached we obtained h k w 1 d thus growth rate is dependent on the available oxygen anabolism and oxygen demand for maintenance metabolism catabolism integrating eq 1 into a generalized von bertalanffy growth function 2 w t w 1 e k t t 0 1 1 d where k is the von bertalanffy growth parameter where k k 1 d the von bertalanffy growth parameter k represents the rate at which maximum body size is reached we assume d 0 7 although values typically range from 0 5 and 0 95 across invertebrate species hughes 1983 johnson and rees 1988 jones et al 1992 sensitivity of maximum body size to changes in temperature and acidity show that low values of d 0 7 results in slight decreases in sensitivity while larger values of d 0 7 results in major increases in sensitivity supplementary table s1 pauly and cheung 2017 effects of multiple stressors show an antagonistic interaction for the effects on body size therefore the use of 0 7 for all species considered here are conservative as smaller values of d do not considerably change temperature and acidity effects on maximum body size while larger values of d only increase sensitivity the effects of temperature were modelled to affect metabolism described in eqs 3 and 4 through the h and k coefficients following the arhennius equation e j t where j e a r with e a and r equal to the activation energy and boltzmann constant respectively furthermore oxygen availability affects aerobic scope i e oxygen supply while acidification affects maintenance metabolism i e oxygen demand we modelled the impacts of decreases in oxygen and ocean acidification following the most viable current working oxygen and capacity limited thermal tolerance hypothesis which assumes that deviations from optimal environmental conditions e g temperature acidity decreases aerobic scope and thus the energy available for growth pörtner 2008 pörtner and farrell 2008 these effects can be modelled in the form 3 h g o 2 e j 1 t and 4 k h h e j 2 t the constants j 1 and j 2 are equal to ea r where ea for anabolism and catabolism respectively and r are the activation energy and boltzmann constant respectively while t is the absolute temperature in kelvin cheung et al 2011 changes in the concentration of oxygen o2 and hydrogen ions h relative to initial conditions thus change h and k respectively the coefficients g and h from eqs 3 and 4 respectively were derived for each species from the average w k and environmental temperature t 0 reported in the literature cheung et al 2011 5 g w 1 d k o 2 e j 1 t and 6 h k 1 d h e j 2 t the model predicts changes in life history parameters due to changes in temperature oxygen availability and ph for asymptotic weight w and von bertalanffy growth parameter k 7 w h k 1 1 d and 8 k k 1 d other parameters that scale with weight can also be predicted including asymptotic length and the length at maturity beverton and holt 1959 natural population mortality rates m were estimated from the empirical equation pauly 1980 9 m 0 4851 0 0824 log w 0 6757 l o g k 0 4687 l o g t where t is the average water temperature of a species range in degrees celsius other parameters are defined above pauly s 1980 model was used here because of data availability and its widespread used for fish stocks and in fisheries assessments we address the scope of using alternative empirical equations in the discussion section thus our model incorporates trade offs between basal metabolism and aerobic scope ultimately affecting life history traits of growth maximum body size and mortality rate additionally at the population level changes in growth parameters affect mean body size and fecundity the construction of our model uses a mixed approach and incorporates both mechanistic and correlative models oa effects on growth mechanistic model operate at multiple levels throughout the dbem and have downstream effects on maximum weight eq 7 growth rate eq 8 and mortality rate eq 9 oa effects on survival correlative model were modelled to directly affect population mortality for both larval and adult stages such that changes in h results in changes in the population mortality rate m eq 9 growth and survival rates change accordingly with changes in ph which we measure here as hydrogen ion concentration h we used parameters from a meta analysis for the effects of oa on life history traits kroeker et al 2013 we modelled the effects of oa under the assumption that the parameter values represent a percent change in growth or survivorship with a doubling of h 2 2 characterizing uncertainties we explored three possible sources of uncertainty in modelling the effects of oa structural parameter and scenario uncertainty first we focus on structural uncertainty as the inaccuracy in the modelled relationship between h and life history rates i e somatic growth rate and survival rate to establish relationships between h and life history traits we used parameter values from kroeker et al 2013 which are point estimates for a given minimum change in ph unfortunately no information on the relationship between these point estimates was available and previous studies have shown variation across species ries et al 2009 we considered three possible ways to represent the structural relationship between h and life history rates and tested the sensitivity of the model projections to each underlying relationship fig 1 illustrates the various options for which we make assumptions about the relationship for option a we scaled changes in h linearly with life history rates relative to initial conditions reflecting a scenario in which a species sensitivity to oa is similar at low and high levels of acidity this represents our baseline model i e 10 s u r v t s u r v i n i t 1 p e r h t h i n i t 1 w surv is the survival rate per year and used here as an example but can be applied to other biological characteristics affected by oa e g growth reproduction calcification survival rate in year t is derived from the initial init survival rate and the relative change in h between year t and initial h conditions per represents the value used from kroeker et al 2013 for the percent change in survival rate with a doubling of h table 1 the exponent w is equal to 1 in the linear model for option b we used an exponential model which reflects a scenario in which a species sensitivity to oa increases with increasing h using eq 10 the exponent w is set to 2 changes in h in these two scenarios are expressed relative to initial conditions defined as the average h between years 1971 and 2000 for option c we explored an adaptation scenario where species are assumed to acclimatize or adapt to recent changes in ph this scenario is represented by expressing changes in ph relative to a moving window of the previous year i e where in eq 10 h init is substituted with h t 1 and survival rate in year t is calculated from the relative change in h between year t and the previous year t 1 the adaptation scenario assumes a linear relationship between h and the biological traits affected by oa and further assumes that acclimatization and or adaptation has a fixed time lag but that the capacity for adaptation is limitless we compare differences between the results from mechanistic and correlative models for oa effects described above as an additional source of structural uncertainty furthermore we included simulations using different earth system models which have different structural characteristics such as grid resolution and marine biogeochemical components bopp et al 2013 we used three earth system models noaa s geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory gfdl esm max planck institute for meteorology mpi esm and institute pierre simon laplace climate modelling centre ipsl esm these models were chosen as they provide high resolution 1 longitude x 1 latitude sea surface and bottom data as well as all the environmental data required by the dbem cheung et al 2016b to characterize parameter uncertainty we generalized oa effects based on taxonomic group and simulated the impacts of oa with the high and low 95 confidence limit values provided in kroeker et al 2013 table 1 while species specific parameters do exist ries et al 2009 we chose to use generalized values to make comparisons of the sensitivity of our results to this source of uncertainty lastly we characterized scenario uncertainty by using the different representative concentration pathways rcp which uses atmospheric greenhouse gas concentration scenarios to drive other environmental variables there are four rcp scenarios commonly used rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 rcp 6 0 and rcp 8 5 the numbers represent radiative forcing values in the year 2100 relative to pre industrial periods under specific emissions scenarios we labelled our pathways as low co2 and high co2 scenarios to predict oa impacts in the future representing rcp 2 6 and rcp 8 5 respectively rcp 2 6 characterizes the optimistic scenario in which immediate action is taken and annual global ghg emissions peaks within a decade year 2025 but is then drastically reduced while this pathway of strong mitigation of ghg emissions is unlikely given the current state of progress it is the closest amongst the rcp scenarios to simulate conditions if we were to achieve targets set in the recent paris agreement at the 2015 united nations framework convention on climate change conference of the parties cop 21 rcp 8 5 characterizes the current emissions trajectory where nations continue to develop their economy and the industrial sector using fossil fuels as the primary source of energy this pathway is often referred to as the business as usual scenario where no shift is made to reduce carbon emissions and invest in sustainable and renewable energy sources since this study focuses on the exploring the sensitivity of multi climatic stressors impacts fishing is assumed to be at level required to achieve maximum sustainable yield for each species in all the scenarios we acknowledge that oa can have effects on other biochemical e g atp production and physiological processes e g acid base regulation which can have downstream effects not directly linked to life history traits e g bioenergetics le quesne and pinnegar 2012 waldbusser et al 2016 however we constructed our model to link oa effects to physiological processes that can then be directly tied to life history traits that affect population dynamics while oa effects on organism biology are generally complex our model uses more generalized models in order to make comparisons about uncertainties 2 3 modelled species we chose 10 commercially exploited invertebrate fisheries species distributed in either the northwest atlantic or the northeast pacific table 2 initial species distributions can be found in supplementary fig s2 some species were distributed across both regions this allowed us to compare results both across and within ocean basins invertebrate species were chosen as current knowledge suggests they are more sensitive to changes in ph than finfish kroeker et al 2013 we chose 5 mollusc species and 5 crustacean species spanning various taxonomic groups including crabs lobsters prawns oysters mussels clams and cephalopods bottom environmental data was used for all demersal species while surface environmental data was used for the only pelagic species included in our analysis d pealeii first we present our results for the impacts of oa on species abundance from a multi stressor model by including results from models run with and without oa impacts in other words we isolate the impacts of oa from other climate change stressors i e temperature and oxygen by taking the difference in abundance between model results with oa and without oa hereon labelled oa and no oa scenarios respectively impacts for each year fig 1b we then present full model results to put those oa effects into context of the overall effects of expected global environmental change 3 results 3 1 projected changes in climate stressors global earth system models project changes to both sea surface and bottom environmental conditions and at a greater rate under high co2 emissions globally average sea surface ph is projected to decrease by as much as 0 4 units an increase in acidity of 140 relative to 1950 fig 2 a average change in sea bottom ph is projected to change by only as much as 0 06 units yet still presents an increase of 14 in acidity fig 2e the magnitude of acidification will vary across ocean basins the three other main drivers temperature oxygen and primary production of species biomass production in our model are projected to drastically change in high co2 scenarios fig 2 for example sea surface temperature is projected to increase by up to 4 c by 2100 while bottom temperature is projected to increase by up to 0 4 c change in net primary production was most variable across models and projections show increases and decreases across different ocean basins fig 2d and supplementary fig s3 in low co2 scenarios the rate of change for many of these biophysical drivers is projected to decline and level off by 2050 3 2 responses to ocean acidification and global change we used american lobster h americanus to demonstrate how changes in temperature and ocean acidity affect life history parameters increases in either temperature or ocean acidity decreases the maximum body size and increases the von bertalanffy growth parameter k fig 3 a and b compounded effects of temperature and acidity further reduce maximum body size e g sheridan and bickford 2011 but show diminishing rates of change as it approaches the asymptotic initial body size at time 0 temperature and acidity combine to then increase the growth parameter k as von bertalanffy s theory predicts that the rate of approaching the maximum body size of smaller individuals and individuals with a smaller maximum body size is faster thus higher k von bertalanffy 1957 additionally temperature and acidity increase the growth rate with the trade off of a reduction in body size atkinson 1994 sheridan and bickford 2011 temperature effects on mass specific growth rate db dt from eq 1 show that smaller individuals initially grow much faster fig 3c while larger individuals will grow much slower with increased temperature fig 3d and e the rate of increased growth due to temperature effects on smaller individuals diminishes with greater change in stressors temperature and acidity while there is a negative synergistic effect on growth rate from multiple stressors for larger individuals impacts of oa on both growth and survival were projected to reduce species abundance under the high co2 scenario by the end of the 21st century fig 4 specifically the combined effects of oa on growth and survival are projected to generally decrease species abundance by as much as 10 american cupped oyster by year 2091 2100 relative to 1996 2005 while under the low co2 scenario there are negligible change of 1 effects on abundance for most species pacific geoduck abundance showed the most sensitivity to oa under the low co2 scenario decreasing by 4 fig 4h interestingly dungeness crab abundance initially decreased due to oa but effects diminished by the end of the simulation fig 4e this pattern is likely due to a greater net increase of suitable habitat relative to the loss of habitat leading to a spatial expansion of range size changes in abundance over time when only oa impacts on growth were included closely follows the abundance for the combined effect of oa on growth and survival fig 4 when impacts to both survival and growth were considered changes in abundance were amplified the magnitudes of oa impacts on abundance were variable but most species show a negative response to oa our results suggest that species abundance is more sensitive to the effects of oa on growth mechanistic model than the effects of oa on survival correlative model trends of changes in abundance with the different structural oa relationship models fig 1a were consistent across species and differences between the relationship models were more pronounced under the high co2 scenario fig 5 supplementary fig s4 for most species with the exception of pacific geoduck changes in abundance were small 1 under the low co2 scenario across all relationship curves fig 5a supplementary fig s4 in the example using american lobster in the high co2 scenario abundance decreased by 1 with the linear relationship while the exponential relationship showed slow declines in abundance initially but reached a tipping point beyond which abundance declined more rapidly to 2 fig 5b changes in abundance under the adaptation scenario were generally small and did not elicit a significant response overall impacts to abundance due to all climate change stressors included in our model e g oa temperature oxygen primary production showed high variability across species with decreases greater than 40 e g longfin inshore squid and increases reaching 100 e g northern prawn by 2100 fig 6 only four of the ten species showed decreased abundance while the other six species showed increased abundance in the high co2 scenario half of the species showed greater than 5 change in abundance in the low co2 scenario suggesting that these species may be sensitive to even small changes in environmental conditions oa showed consistently negative impacts on abundance across most species with greater differences between oa and no oa models in the high co2 scenario mollusc species were more sensitive to oa than crustacean species with the exception of blue mussels and coonstripe shrimp we used american lobster once again as an example to show the biogeographic changes under the high co2 scenario the distribution of american lobster shows negative impacts to its southern range fig 7 a areas in the gulf of st lawrence and areas farther offshore show increased abundance however the net effect of the changes in the geographic distribution is an overall decrease in abundance fig 6b oa effects appear to be greatest in more northern and periphery areas of their geographic range fig 7b however areas with greater oa effects correspond with areas of increased abundance suggesting that oa may be limiting population growth and range expansion in response to other climate change drivers i e temperature 3 3 sensitivity to uncertainty results from the dbem showed varying levels of sensitivity to each source of uncertainty for each species we quantified the range of projected changes in abundance for each source of uncertainty and found that changes in abundance were most sensitive to the uncertainty in the structural relationship between h and life history traits i e linear exponential adaptation table 3 we expected scenario uncertainty rcp 2 6 and 8 5 to be greatest as it essentially indicates diverging pathways for global co2 concentrations and this had the second highest average range of uncertainty table 3 with other sources of structural uncertainty our results were moderately sensitive to the choice of modeling approach i e mechanistic effects on growth versus correlative effects on survival our results were relatively robust to the various earth system models sensitivity to parameter uncertainty was the smallest suggesting our results are relatively robust to the magnitude of oa effects this is an important finding as we used parameters for oa effects that were derived from meta analyses for broad taxonomic groups however american cupped oyster showed very high uncertainty when different oa effect sizes were used the sensitivity to each level of model uncertainty was highly variable across species coonstripe shrimp showed the greatest range of uncertainty for all categories except parameter uncertainty table 3 where they were affected by oa equally with the different effect sizes used table 1 this was surprising as they also showed a significantly large negative response to oa fig 4 while results from other species suggest that our model is robust to oa parameter uncertainty it is not true for all species american cupped oyster abundance was most sensitive to parameter uncertainty with a range of 13 1 between outputs but overall trends were consistently negative table 3 furthermore our results suggest that species most vulnerable to oa may be the ones that show greater negative effects of oa but are less sensitive to parameter perturbations such as pacific geoduck and coonstripe shrimp 4 discussion our results present an analysis of the assumptions and uncertainties in modelling the biophysical impacts of oa using a spatially explicit model results of changes in abundance show sensitivity to all levels of uncertainty tested although this varied with species and the type of uncertainty in modelling oa effects our results were sensitive to important assumptions of impacts on different life history rates structural relationship between h and life history rates and parameter estimates oa impacts on abundance were consistent across species and generally showed a negative relationship with increased acidity fig 4 any measured increase in abundance due to oa was associated with the low co2 scenario and generally small table 3 however some species increased in overall abundance in response to all global change stressors fig 6 this trend is a result of the ability of a species to disperse and recolonize habitats that become more favourable with environmental change temperature driven geographical shifts and range expansion could overshadow any small negative effects of oa temperature effects can outweigh effects of oa on performance such as on growth and calcification e g mcneil et al 2004 paul et al 2015 organism responses to temperature and oa interactions are complex across species and previous studies have revealed synergistic additive and antagonistic interaction effects harvey et al 2013 kroeker et al 2014 munday et al 2009 however there have yet to be any empirical studies that show that temperature driven geographical range shifts can outweigh any negative impacts of oa our results show overall increases in abundance for some species due to temperature driven range shifts despite the negative effects of oa fig 6 oa effects on dungeness crab abundance appear to diminish with greater increases in abundance after year 2065 suggesting that range expansion outweighs the effects of oa figs 4e and 6e furthermore such increases in abundance are not ubiquitous across the species range and may only apply to certain areas e g poleward limits of geographical range whereas other areas may see significant decreases e g equatorward limits of geographical range fig 7 variability in our model results shows the importance of parameter selection uncertainty and the various underlying assumptions when integrating oa effects in species distribution models previous studies that have incorporated oa usually address uncertainty by using a range of effect sizes typically derived from meta analyses and empirical studies ainsworth et al 2011 cheung et al 2011 our results suggest that our model is generally robust to oa parameter uncertainty but some species were highly sensitive to parameter perturbations using generalized parameters across taxonomic groups is sufficient for broad scale analyses or comparisons e g lam et al 2014 but integrating species specific data into models is essential when evaluating individual species for management purposes especially for species that are highly sensitive to sources of uncertainty with the growing literature on impacts of oa on marine life projection models can utilize updated empirical data as input parameters to provide more accurate representations of oa effects ries et al 2009 incorporating oa effects on different life history traits and the downstream effects on abundance provides novel insight to the alternative approaches that must be considered when constructing models kroeker et al 2017 a mechanistic approach requires an understanding of the drivers and underlying biophysical processes and is therefore more difficult to incorporate as more information is typically required however with a greater understanding of the mechanisms at play and the specific information needed the responses to oa may be more realistic and accurate alternatively correlative models offer a more straightforward approach and are often easier to interpret correlative models may provide equally accurate results without the additional assumptions needed to incorporate mechanistic processes our model results indicate that the mechanistic approach has greater effects on abundance even when the parameters used for survival were much greater i e molluscs table 1 the correlative approach provides a more direct effect of oa on population dynamics but assumes that underlying oa effects on physiological processes translate to changes in survival using a mechanistic approach relates oa to changes in aerobic scope and the subsequent trade offs with other life history parameters e g growth rate maximum body size survival pörtner 2008 for example natural mortality was modelled to be dependent on growth traits and temperature eq 9 indirect effects of oa on other traits such as fecundity also emerge as we model them as a function of body size the mechanistic approach allows us to address some of the complexities of oa effects and how it scales from physiology to population biogeography however oa affects many other physiological processes and life histories and are highly variable across species current knowledge of the exact mechanisms and trade offs between life histories are still not fully understood and there are other competing models kroeker et al 2013 pörtner et al 2006 ries et al 2009 pauly s 1980 model for natural mortality was chosen over other alternative empirical equations e g gislason et al 2010 then et al 2015 because of its simplicity and the availability of life history parameters for the invertebrate species considered here physiological models used here were chosen because they provide a parsimonious representation despite not being ubiquitous across all species while there are other working hypotheses for modelling physiological responses to environmental change e g clark and sandblom 2013 lefevre et al 2017 these tend to be much more complex requiring a deeper knowledge of the mechanistic processes indeed future studies should test the sensitivity of the dbem to various equations of natural mortality and physiological processes with more experimental evidence using both correlative and mechanistic models allows our model to address generalized oa effects on population dynamics while incorporating effects on organism biology that can have profound effects at the population level few studies have considered the relationship between changes in oa and organism responses when modelling oa impacts on biological systems the rule of parsimony favours a linear relationship yet there is evidence of varying relationship curves e g anthony et al 2011 kleypas et al 2006 ries et al 2009 this is especially important with greater changes in oa for example using the exponential relationship as a threshold or tipping point scenario responses are much greater with high acidification but the onset of responses only occurs with a certain degree of acidification fig 5 tipping points for oa impacts can have drastic consequences to marine ecosystems and can manifest in ways such as direct impacts on physiological processes monaco and helmuth 2011 to indirect impacts on habitat availability sunday et al 2017 furthermore experimental studies often focus on acute changes in ph yet natural oa is a combination of gradual declines in the average ph and dynamic more extreme temporal fluctuations in ph gradual changes in ph may favour species with high evolutionary potential lohbeck et al 2012 sunday et al 2011 and more extreme fluctuations in ph may favour species with wide ph range tolerance ellis et al 2016 haigh et al 2015 with knowledge of the evolutionary potential and oa tolerance of a species future studies could apply a combination of an adaptation model and alternative relationship curves to better represent long term effects of oa on species distribution and abundance species distribution models are valuable tools for projections of future global change for both natural environments and the societies that depend on ecosystem goods and services in addition to being some of the most susceptible organisms to oa we evaluate marine invertebrates as they are ecologically important as key intermediate links to ecosystem structure and function fagerli et al 2013 reed 2002 steneck et al 2002 and important economic resources as some of the most valuable fisheries species cooley and doney 2009 fao 2016 biophysical projection models can then be coupled with socioeconomic scenarios that present possible management regimes for fisheries resources e g costello et al 2016 our model does not incorporate feedbacks of fisheries responses e g profitability management activity to changes in stock biomass but it is an essential component to accurately model the dynamic interplay between environmental and anthropogenic pressures and responses of fisheries stocks and ecosystems results from projection models can also help inform future decisions and link to policies and agreements e g projections of climate change impacts on global marine fisheries have shown the importance of meeting international targets to reduce emissions for both fisheries catch cheung et al 2016b and revenues lam et al 2016 there are a number of studies that provide projections of the potential oa impacts to marine fisheries through extensive literature reviews and risk analyses frameworks branch et al 2013 ekstrom et al 2015 le quesne and pinnegar 2012 mathis et al 2015 we envision the use of our results to develop a better understanding and potentially reducing the uncertainty with projecting oa impacts on living marine resources our results of scaling oa effects from physiology to population biogeography provide useful insight to the underlying uncertainties and sensitivities constructing projection models such as the one here requires sound theoretical and empirical information further progress in reducing uncertainties can be made with more integration across disciplines and communication between the inputs and outputs needed by experimental biologists ecologists and modellers for example data from ocean acidification and warming experiments were used in a projection model to estimate potential impacts to species distribution and abundance all in one synthesized paper queirós et al 2015 with accelerated oa and climate change leading to the emergence of more downstream consequences it is essential to

25207,ocean acidification oa driven by anthropogenic co2 emissions affects marine ecosystems fisheries and aquaculture assessing the impacts of oa using projection models facilitates the development of future scenarios and potential solutions here we explored various ways to incorporate oa impacts into a multi stressor dynamic bioclimatic envelope model to project biogeographic changes of ten commercially exploited invertebrate species we examine three dimensions of uncertainties in modelling biophysical oa effects model structure parameterization and scenario uncertainty our results show that projected oa impacts are most sensitive to the choice of structural relationship between oa and biological responses followed by the choice of climate change emission scenarios and parameterizations of the size of oa effects species generally showed negative effects to oa but sensitivity to the various sources of uncertainty were not consistent across or within species for example some species showed higher sensitivity to structural uncertainty and very low sensitivity to parameter uncertainty while others showed greatest sensitivity to parameter uncertainty this variability is largely due to geographic variability and difference in life history traits used to parameterize model simulations our model highlights the variability across the sources of uncertainty and contributes to the development of integrating oa impacts in species distribution models we further stress the importance of defining the limitations and assumptions as well as exploring the range of uncertainties associated with modelling oa impacts keywords species distribution dynamic bioclimatic envelope model invertebrate projection model 1 introduction carbon dioxide co2 emissions from human activities such as the burning of fossil fuels largely contributes to the rapid rate of ocean acidification oa since the industrial revolution ipcc 2013 oa is the chemical process driven by elevated atmospheric co2 that results in reduced ph and increased acidity global sea surface ph has already decreased by 0 1 units since the pre industrial average of 8 17 a 26 increase in acidity caldeira and wickett 2003 feely et al 2009 pörtner et al 2014 under our current emissions trajectory sea surface ph is projected to decrease by an additional 0 3 units by the end of the 21st century ciais et al 2013 ipcc 2013 some areas are experiencing much larger changes in ph for example the northeast pacific ocean has naturally fluctuating ph levels due to upwelling and the uptake of anthropogenic co2 is elevating acidification across these areas feely et al 2014 haigh et al 2015 ocean acidification is expected to impact marine organisms communities and ecosystems branch et al

ecosystem types heuer and grosell 2014 kroeker et al 2013 nagelkerken and connell 2015 most notably oa compromises the ability of organisms to efficiently build and retain calcium carbonate structures

al 2009 beyond calcification oa affects a wide range of physiological processes such as acid base balance basal metabolic rates aerobic scope oxygen consumption thermal tolerance fertilization rates and development among others detailed in le quesne and pinnegar 2012 direct impacts of oa on changes in species abundance will result in important changes to competitive facilitative and trophic relationships dutkiewicz et al 2015 queirós et al 2015 sunday et al 2017 trenkel et al 2005 overall changes in physiology and behaviour lead to changes in growth and abundance and when considered across multiple interacting species results in important changes in community structure and ecosystem function kroeker et al 2013 nagelkerken and connell 2015 oa coincides with other anthropogenic co2 driven stressors including ocean warming and decreases in dissolved oxygen concentration increases in temperature affects physiological processes such as metabolism increasing the demand for oxygen and reducing aerobic scope pörtner and lannig 2009 decreases in oxygen content further exacerbates this effect and is projected to lower the metabolic capacity of marine habitats potentially leading to decreased body size cheung et al 2013a deutsch et al 2015 pauly and cheung 2017 biogeographic responses to ocean warming and decreased oxygen content have been observed as shifts in distributions to deeper and higher latitudinal waters cheung et al 2013b dulvy et al 2008 perry et al 2005 while isolating the effects of oa is important for understanding the mechanisms in which oa effects operate integrating oa with other stressors provides a more real world application of the effects of anthropogenic influenced global changes on species distribution and abundance the inclusion of oa in assessing impacts of anthropogenic co2 emissions is important in developing scenarios of future global change for marine systems published syntheses and meta analyses are extremely useful for providing baseline parameters for modelling and assessing the biological impacts of oa kroeker et al 2013 nagelkerken and connell 2015 sunday et al 2017 they also provide a basis for linking complex physiological responses to life history traits that have direct implications on population dynamics for example cheung et al 2011 incorporated physiological models into a dynamic bioclimatic envelope model cheung et al 2008 to assess climate change effects on species distribution and abundance this model was then applied to a socioeconomic analysis of climate change and oa impacts in the arctic ocean lam et al 2014 empirical models of oa effects have also been used to estimate changes in the growth rates of mollusc species and thereby impacts on us mollusc fisheries moore 2015 ries et al 2009 another promising approach incorporates information about marine food webs by using an ecosystem model to model the impacts of oa on functional groups that include harvested taxa ainsworth et al 2011 projection models provide valuable insight to potential future scenarios but are subject to various sources of uncertainty uncertainty when modelling ocean acidification arises from the choice of model parameterizations which produce a range of possible impact pathways we define three sources of uncertainty when modelling oa impacts 1 structural 2 parameter and 3 scenario uncertainty hawkins and sutton 2009 structural uncertainty refers to the underlying construction of the model such as the mathematical formulation of a model to represent ecological relationships or the processes modelled using correlative versus mechanistic approaches e g pauly et al 2000 parameter uncertainty stems from the inherent variability and our limited ability to accurately and precisely measure biological processes and relationships e g kremer 1983 scenario uncertainty results from the different possible future pathways due to many socioeconomic factors e g governmental policies technological development that affect biophysical drivers this includes the various greenhouse gas concentration trajectories used to drive climate and biophysical models ipcc 2013 the combined uncertainties produce the full range of future trajectories providing valuable insight to the sensitivities of modelling oa impacts in this study we explored various ways to incorporate oa impacts into a multi stressor dynamic bioclimatic envelope model to project changes in the biogeography of ten commercially exploited invertebrate species we examined the structural parameterization and scenario uncertainties in modelling oa effects to eventually improve our confidence in forecasting future scenarios we explored the variability of model outputs and discussed the utilities and limitations of different ways to incorporate oa impacts in spatial biogeographic models 2 methods we incorporated the impacts of oa into a previously developed dynamic bioclimatic envelope model dbem cheung et al 2016a 2011 2008 to estimate changes in species distribution and abundance the dbem uses earth system models as inputs e g dunne et al 2013 and links species distribution models jones et al 2012 advection diffusion movement models sibert et al 1999 growth models pauly 1980 physiological models pauly 1981 and population dynamics models hilborn and walters 1992 o connor et al 2007 pauly 1980 to predict how species will move geographically across time annual time step and space on a 0 5 latitude x 0 5 longitude grid with climate change we outline the specifics of modelling the effects of oa and how it interacts with effects from other stressors i e temperature and oxygen below while other details on the dbem can be found in the supplementary material supplementary fig s1 2 1 modelling the effects of global change global change effects on organisms and populations include changes in temperature oxygen and ph we integrated the biological impacts of oa on exploited populations through the effects on somatic growth and mortality rates we define the effects on somatic growth as a mechanistic process and the effects on survival as a correlative process first the model uses the von bertalanffy growth function von bertalanffy 1951 to simulate changes in growth in response to ocean warming decreases in dissolved oxygen concentration and ocean acidification cheung et al 2011 growth rate change in biomass b as a function of time t is determined with the derived equation from a growth function 1 d b d t h w d k w b where h and k represent the coefficients for anabolism and catabolism respectively anabolism scales with body weight w to the exponent d 1 catabolism scales linearly with w i e b 1 and their difference determines the growth rate of species biomass b solving for db dt 0 when asymptotic weight w is reached we obtained h k w 1 d thus growth rate is dependent on the available oxygen anabolism and oxygen demand for maintenance metabolism catabolism integrating eq 1 into a generalized von bertalanffy growth function 2 w t w 1 e k t t 0 1 1 d where k is the von bertalanffy growth parameter where k k 1 d the von bertalanffy growth parameter k represents the rate at which maximum body size is reached we assume d 0 7 although values typically range from 0 5 and 0 95 across invertebrate species hughes 1983 johnson and rees 1988 jones et al 1992 sensitivity of maximum body size to changes in temperature and acidity show that low values of d 0 7 results in slight decreases in sensitivity while larger values of d 0 7 results in major increases in sensitivity supplementary table s1 pauly and cheung 2017 effects of multiple stressors show an antagonistic interaction for the effects on body size therefore the use of 0 7 for all species considered here are conservative as smaller values of d do not considerably change temperature and acidity effects on maximum body size while larger values of d only increase sensitivity the effects of temperature were modelled to affect metabolism described in eqs 3 and 4 through the h and k coefficients following the arhennius equation e j t where j e a r with e a and r equal to the activation energy and boltzmann constant respectively furthermore oxygen availability affects aerobic scope i e oxygen supply while acidification affects maintenance metabolism i e oxygen demand we modelled the impacts of decreases in oxygen and ocean acidification following the most viable current working oxygen and capacity limited thermal tolerance hypothesis which assumes that deviations from optimal environmental conditions e g temperature acidity decreases aerobic scope and thus the energy available for growth pörtner 2008 pörtner and farrell 2008 these effects can be modelled in the form 3 h g o 2 e j 1 t and 4 k h h e j 2 t the constants j 1 and j 2 are equal to ea r where ea for anabolism and catabolism respectively and r are the activation energy and boltzmann constant respectively while t is the absolute temperature in kelvin cheung et al 2011 changes in the concentration of oxygen o2 and hydrogen ions h relative to initial conditions thus change h and k respectively the coefficients g and h from eqs 3 and 4 respectively were derived for each species from the average w k and environmental temperature t 0 reported in the literature cheung et al 2011 5

degrees celsius other parameters are defined above pauly s 1980 model was used here because of data availability and its widespread used for fish stocks and in fisheries assessments we address the scope of using alternative empirical equations in the discussion section thus our model incorporates trade offs between basal metabolism and aerobic scope ultimately affecting life history traits of growth maximum body size and mortality rate additionally at the population level changes in growth parameters affect mean body size and fecundity the construction of our model uses a mixed approach and incorporates both mechanistic and correlative models oa effects on growth mechanistic model operate at multiple levels throughout the dbem and have downstream effects on maximum weight eq 7 growth rate eq 8 and mortality rate eq 9 oa effects on survival correlative model were modelled to directly affect population mortality for both larval and adult stages such that changes in h results in changes in the population mortality rate m eq 9 growth and survival rates change accordingly with changes in ph which we measure here as hydrogen ion concentration h we used parameters from a meta analysis for the effects of oa on life history traits kroeker et al 2013 we modelled the effects of oa under the assumption that the parameter values represent a percent change in growth or survivorship with a doubling of h 2 2 characterizing uncertainties we explored three possible sources of uncertainty in modelling the effects of oa structural parameter and scenario uncertainty first we focus on structural uncertainty as the inaccuracy in the modelled relationship between h and life history rates i e somatic growth rate and survival rate to establish relationships between h and life history traits we used parameter values from kroeker et al 2013 which are point estimates for a given minimum change in ph unfortunately no information on the relationship between these point estimates was available and previous studies have shown variation across species ries et al 2009 we considered three possible ways to represent the structural relationship between h and life history rates and tested the sensitivity of the model projections to each underlying relationship fig 1 illustrates the various options for which we make assumptions about the relationship for option a we scaled changes in h linearly with life history rates relative to initial conditions reflecting a scenario in which a species sensitivity to oa is similar at low and high levels of acidity this represents our baseline model i e 10 s u r v t s u r v i n i t 1 p e r h t h i n i t 1 w surv is the survival rate per year and used here as an example but can be applied to other biological characteristics affected by oa e g growth reproduction calcification survival rate in year t is derived from the initial init survival rate and the relative change in h between year t and initial h conditions per represents the value used from kroeker et al 2013 for the percent change in survival rate with a doubling of h table 1 the exponent w is equal to 1 in the linear model for option b we used an exponential model which reflects a scenario in which a species sensitivity to oa increases with increasing h using eq 10 the exponent w is set to 2 changes in h in these two scenarios are expressed relative to initial conditions defined as the average h between years 1971 and 2000 for option c we explored an adaptation scenario where species are assumed to acclimatize or adapt to recent changes in ph this scenario is represented by expressing changes in ph relative to a moving window of the previous year i e where in eq 10 h init is substituted with h t 1 and survival rate in year t is calculated from the relative change in h between year t and the previous year t 1 the adaptation scenario assumes a linear relationship between h and the biological traits affected by oa and further assumes that acclimatization and or adaptation has a fixed time lag but that the capacity for adaptation is limitless we compare differences between the results from mechanistic and correlative models for oa effects described above as an additional source of structural uncertainty furthermore we included simulations using different earth system models which have different structural characteristics such as grid resolution and marine biogeochemical components bopp et al 2013 we used three earth system models noaa s geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory gfdl esm max planck institute for meteorology mpi esm and institute pierre simon laplace climate modelling centre ipsl esm these models were chosen as they provide high resolution 1 longitude x 1 latitude sea surface and bottom data as well as all the environmental data required by the dbem cheung et al 2016b to characterize parameter uncertainty we generalized oa effects based on taxonomic group and simulated the impacts of oa with the high and low 95 confidence limit values provided in kroeker et al 2013 table 1 while species specific parameters do exist ries et al 2009 we chose to use generalized values to make comparisons of the sensitivity of our results to this source of uncertainty lastly we characterized scenario uncertainty by using the different representative concentration pathways rcp which uses atmospheric greenhouse gas concentration scenarios to drive other environmental variables there are four rcp scenarios commonly used rcp 2 6 rcp 4 5 rcp 6 0 and rcp 8 5 the numbers represent radiative forcing values in the year 2100 relative to pre industrial periods under specific emissions scenarios we labelled our pathways as low co2 and high co2 scenarios to predict oa impacts in the future representing rcp 2 6 and rcp 8 5 respectively rcp 2 6 characterizes the optimistic scenario in which immediate action is taken and annual global ghg emissions peaks within a decade year 2025 but is then drastically reduced while this pathway of strong mitigation of ghg emissions is unlikely given the current state of progress it is the closest amongst the rcp scenarios to simulate conditions if we were to achieve targets set in the recent paris agreement at the 2015 united nations framework convention on climate change conference of the parties cop 21 rcp 8 5 characterizes the current emissions trajectory where nations continue to develop their economy and the industrial sector using fossil fuels as the primary source of energy this pathway is often referred to as the business as usual scenario where no shift is made to reduce carbon emissions and invest in sustainable and renewable energy sources since this study focuses on the exploring the sensitivity of multi climatic stressors impacts fishing is assumed to be at level required to achieve maximum sustainable yield for each species in all the scenarios we acknowledge that oa can have effects on other biochemical e g atp production and physiological processes e g acid base regulation which can have downstream effects not directly linked to life history traits e g bioenergetics le quesne and pinnegar 2012 waldbusser et al 2016 however we constructed our model to link oa effects to physiological processes that can then be directly tied to life history traits that affect population dynamics while oa effects on organism biology are generally complex our model uses more generalized models in order to make comparisons about uncertainties 2 3 modelled species we chose 10 commercially exploited invertebrate fisheries species distributed in either the northwest atlantic or the northeast pacific table 2 initial species distributions can be found in supplementary fig s2 some species were distributed across both regions this allowed us to compare results both across and within ocean basins invertebrate species were chosen as current knowledge suggests they are more sensitive to changes in ph than finfish kroeker et al 2013 we chose 5 mollusc species and 5 crustacean species spanning various taxonomic groups including crabs lobsters prawns oysters mussels clams and cephalopods bottom environmental data was used for all demersal species while surface environmental data was used for the only pelagic species included in our analysis d pealeii first we present our results for the impacts of oa on species abundance from a multi stressor model by including results from models run with and without oa impacts in other words we isolate the impacts of oa from other climate change stressors i e temperature and oxygen by taking the difference in abundance between model results with oa and without oa hereon labelled oa and no oa scenarios respectively impacts for each year fig 1b we then present full model results to put those oa effects into context of the overall effects of expected global environmental change 3 results 3 1 projected changes in climate stressors global earth system models project changes to both sea surface and bottom environmental conditions and at a greater rate under high co2 emissions globally average sea surface ph is projected to decrease by as much as 0 4 units an increase in acidity of 140 relative to 1950 fig 2 a average change in sea bottom ph is projected to change by only as much as 0 06 units yet still presents an increase of 14 in acidity fig 2e the magnitude of acidification will vary across ocean basins the three other main drivers temperature oxygen and primary production of species biomass production in our model are projected to drastically change in high co2 scenarios fig 2 for example sea surface temperature is projected to increase by up to 4 c by 2100 while bottom temperature is projected to increase by up to 0 4 c change in net primary production was most variable across models and projections show increases and decreases across different ocean basins fig 2d and supplementary fig s3 in low co2 scenarios the rate of change for many of these biophysical drivers is projected to decline and level off by 2050 3 2 responses to ocean acidification and global change we used american lobster h americanus to demonstrate how changes in temperature and ocean acidity affect life history parameters increases in either temperature or ocean acidity decreases the maximum body size and increases the von bertalanffy growth parameter k fig 3 a and b compounded effects of temperature and acidity further reduce maximum body size e g sheridan and bickford 2011 but show diminishing rates of change as it approaches the asymptotic initial body size at time 0 temperature and acidity combine to then increase the growth parameter k as von bertalanffy s theory predicts that the rate of approaching the maximum body size of smaller individuals and individuals with a smaller maximum body size is faster thus higher k von bertalanffy 1957 additionally temperature and acidity increase the growth rate with the trade off of a reduction in body size atkinson 1994 sheridan and bickford 2011 temperature effects on mass specific growth rate db dt from eq 1 show that smaller individuals initially grow much faster fig 3c while larger individuals will grow much slower with increased temperature fig 3d and e the rate of increased growth due to temperature effects on smaller individuals diminishes with greater change in stressors temperature and acidity while there is a negative synergistic effect on growth rate from multiple stressors for larger individuals impacts of oa on both growth and survival were projected to reduce species abundance under the high co2 scenario by the end of the 21st century fig 4 specifically the combined effects of oa on growth and survival are projected to generally decrease species abundance by as much as 10 american cupped oyster by year 2091 2100 relative to 1996 2005 while under the low co2 scenario there are negligible change of 1 effects on abundance for most species pacific geoduck abundance showed the most sensitivity to oa under the low co2 scenario decreasing by 4 fig 4h interestingly dungeness crab abundance initially decreased due to oa but effects diminished by the end of the simulation fig 4e this pattern is likely due to a greater net increase of suitable habitat relative to the loss of habitat leading to a spatial expansion of range size changes in abundance over time when only oa impacts on growth were included closely follows the abundance for the combined effect of oa on growth and survival fig 4 when impacts to both survival and growth were considered changes in abundance were amplified the magnitudes of oa impacts on abundance were variable but most species show a negative response to oa our results suggest that species abundance is more sensitive to the effects of oa on growth mechanistic model than the effects of oa on survival correlative model trends of changes in abundance with the different structural oa relationship models fig 1a were consistent across species and differences between the relationship models were more pronounced under the high co2 scenario fig 5 supplementary fig s4 for most species with the exception of pacific geoduck changes in abundance were small 1 under the low co2 scenario across all relationship curves fig 5a supplementary fig s4 in the example using american lobster in the high co2 scenario abundance decreased by 1 with the linear relationship while the exponential relationship showed slow declines in abundance initially but reached a tipping point beyond which abundance declined more rapidly to 2 fig 5b changes in abundance under the adaptation scenario were generally small and did not elicit a significant response overall impacts to abundance due to all climate change stressors included in our model e g oa temperature oxygen primary production showed high variability across species with decreases greater than 40 e g longfin inshore squid and increases reaching 100 e g northern prawn by 2100 fig 6 only four of the ten species showed decreased abundance while the other six species showed increased abundance in the high co2 scenario half of the species showed greater than 5 change in abundance in the low co2 scenario suggesting that these species may be sensitive to even small changes in environmental conditions oa showed consistently negative impacts on abundance across most species with greater differences between oa and no oa models in the high co2 scenario mollusc species were more sensitive to oa than crustacean species with the exception of blue mussels and coonstripe shrimp we used american lobster once again as an example to show the biogeographic changes under the high co2 scenario the distribution of american lobster shows negative impacts to its southern range fig 7 a areas in the gulf of st lawrence and areas farther offshore show increased abundance however the net effect of the changes in the geographic distribution is an overall decrease in abundance fig 6b oa effects appear to be greatest in more northern and periphery areas of their geographic range fig 7b however areas with greater oa effects correspond with areas of increased abundance suggesting that oa may be limiting population growth and range expansion in response to other climate change drivers i e temperature 3 3 sensitivity to uncertainty results from the dbem showed varying levels of sensitivity to each source of uncertainty for each species we quantified the range of projected changes in abundance for each source of uncertainty and found that changes in abundance were most sensitive to the uncertainty in the structural relationship between h and life history traits i e linear exponential adaptation table 3 we expected scenario uncertainty rcp 2 6 and 8 5 to be greatest as it essentially indicates diverging pathways for global co2 concentrations and this had the second highest average range of uncertainty table 3 with other sources of structural uncertainty our results were moderately sensitive to the choice of modeling approach i e mechanistic effects on growth versus correlative effects on survival our results were relatively robust to the various earth system models sensitivity to parameter uncertainty was the smallest suggesting our results are relatively robust to the magnitude of oa effects this is an important finding as we used parameters for oa effects that were derived from meta analyses for broad taxonomic groups however american cupped oyster showed very high uncertainty when different oa effect sizes were used the sensitivity to each level of model uncertainty was highly variable across species coonstripe shrimp showed the greatest range of uncertainty for all categories except parameter uncertainty table 3 where they were affected by oa equally with the different effect sizes used table 1 this was surprising as they also showed a significantly large negative response to oa fig 4 while results from other species suggest that our model is robust to oa parameter uncertainty it is not true for all species american cupped oyster abundance was most sensitive to parameter uncertainty with a range of 13 1 between outputs but overall trends were consistently negative table 3 furthermore our results suggest that species most vulnerable to oa may be the ones that show greater negative effects of oa but are less sensitive to parameter perturbations such as pacific geoduck and coonstripe shrimp 4 discussion our results present an analysis of the assumptions and uncertainties in modelling the biophysical impacts of oa using a spatially explicit model results of changes in abundance show sensitivity to all levels of uncertainty tested although this varied with species and the type of uncertainty in modelling oa effects our results were sensitive to important assumptions of impacts on different life history rates structural relationship between h and life history rates and parameter estimates oa impacts on abundance were consistent across species and generally showed a negative relationship with increased acidity fig 4 any measured increase in abundance due to oa was associated with the low co2 scenario and generally small table 3 however some species increased in overall abundance in response to all global change stressors fig 6 this trend is a result of the ability of a species to disperse and recolonize habitats that become more favourable with environmental change temperature driven geographical shifts and range expansion could overshadow any small negative effects of oa temperature effects can outweigh effects of oa on performance such as on growth and calcification e g mcneil et al 2004 paul et al 2015 organism responses to temperature and oa interactions are complex across species and previous studies have revealed synergistic additive and antagonistic interaction effects harvey et al 2013 kroeker et al 2014 munday et al 2009 however there have yet to be any empirical studies that show that temperature driven geographical range shifts can outweigh any negative impacts of oa our results show overall increases in abundance for some species due to temperature driven range shifts despite the negative effects of oa fig 6 oa effects on dungeness crab abundance appear to diminish with greater increases in abundance after year 2065 suggesting that range expansion outweighs the effects of oa figs 4e and 6e furthermore such increases in abundance are not ubiquitous across the species range and may only apply to certain areas e g poleward limits of geographical range whereas other areas may see significant decreases e g equatorward limits of geographical range fig 7 variability in our model results shows the importance of parameter selection uncertainty and the various underlying assumptions when integrating oa effects in species distribution models previous studies that have incorporated oa usually address uncertainty by using a range of effect sizes typically derived from meta analyses and empirical studies ainsworth et al 2011 cheung et al 2011 our results suggest that our model is generally robust to oa parameter uncertainty but some species were highly sensitive to parameter perturbations using generalized parameters across taxonomic groups is sufficient for broad scale analyses or comparisons e g lam et al 2014 but integrating species specific data into models is essential when evaluating individual species for management purposes especially for species that are highly sensitive to sources of uncertainty with the growing literature on impacts of oa on marine life projection models can utilize updated empirical data as input parameters to provide more accurate representations of oa effects ries et al 2009 incorporating oa effects on different life history traits and the downstream effects on abundance provides novel insight to the alternative approaches that must be considered when constructing models kroeker et al 2017 a mechanistic approach requires an understanding of the drivers and underlying biophysical processes and is therefore more difficult to incorporate as more information is typically required however with a greater understanding of the mechanisms at play and the specific information needed the responses to oa may be more realistic and accurate alternatively correlative models offer a more straightforward approach and are often easier to interpret correlative models may provide equally accurate results without the additional assumptions needed to incorporate mechanistic processes our model results indicate that the mechanistic approach has greater effects on abundance even when the parameters used for survival were much greater i e molluscs table 1 the correlative approach provides a more direct effect of oa on population dynamics but assumes that underlying oa effects on physiological processes translate to changes in survival using a mechanistic approach relates oa to changes in aerobic scope and the subsequent trade offs with other life history parameters e g growth rate maximum body size survival pörtner 2008 for example natural mortality was modelled to be dependent on growth traits and temperature eq 9 indirect effects of oa on other traits such as fecundity also emerge as we model them as a function of body size the mechanistic approach allows us to address some of the complexities of oa effects and how it scales from physiology to population biogeography however oa affects many other physiological processes and life histories and are highly variable across species current knowledge of the exact mechanisms and trade offs between life histories are still not fully understood and there are other competing models kroeker et al 2013 pörtner et al 2006 ries et al 2009 pauly s 1980 model for natural mortality was chosen over other alternative empirical equations e g gislason et al 2010 then et al 2015 because of its simplicity and the availability of life history parameters for the invertebrate species considered here physiological models used here were chosen because they provide a parsimonious representation despite not being ubiquitous across all species while there are other working hypotheses for modelling physiological responses to environmental change e g clark and sandblom 2013 lefevre et al 2017 these tend to be much more complex requiring a deeper knowledge of the mechanistic processes indeed future studies should test the sensitivity of the dbem to various equations of natural mortality and physiological processes with more experimental evidence using both correlative and mechanistic models allows our model to address generalized oa effects on population dynamics while incorporating effects on organism biology that can have profound effects at the population level few studies have considered the relationship between changes in oa and organism responses when modelling oa impacts on biological systems the rule of parsimony favours a linear relationship yet there is evidence of varying relationship curves e g anthony et al 2011 kleypas et al 2006 ries et al 2009 this is especially important with greater changes in oa for example using the exponential relationship as a threshold or tipping point scenario responses are much greater with high acidification but the onset of responses only occurs with a certain degree of acidification fig 5 tipping points for oa impacts can have drastic consequences to marine ecosystems and can manifest in ways such as direct impacts on physiological processes monaco and helmuth 2011 to indirect impacts on habitat availability sunday et al 2017 furthermore experimental studies often focus on acute changes in ph yet natural oa is a combination of gradual declines in the average ph and dynamic more extreme temporal fluctuations in ph gradual changes in ph may favour species with high evolutionary potential lohbeck et al 2012 sunday et al 2011 and more extreme fluctuations in ph may favour species with wide ph range tolerance ellis et al 2016 haigh et al 2015 with knowledge of the evolutionary potential and oa tolerance of a species future studies could apply a combination of an adaptation model and alternative relationship curves to better represent long term effects of oa on species distribution and abundance species distribution models are valuable tools for projections of future global change for both natural environments and the societies that depend on ecosystem goods and services in addition to being some of the most susceptible organisms to oa we evaluate marine invertebrates as they are ecologically important as key intermediate links to ecosystem structure and function fagerli et al 2013 reed 2002 steneck et al 2002 and important economic resources as some of the most valuable fisheries species cooley and doney 2009 fao 2016 biophysical projection models can then be coupled with socioeconomic scenarios that present possible management regimes for fisheries resources e g costello et al 2016 our model does not incorporate feedbacks of fisheries responses e g profitability management activity to changes in stock biomass but it is an essential component to accurately model the dynamic interplay between environmental and anthropogenic pressures and responses of fisheries stocks and ecosystems results from projection models can also help inform future decisions and link to policies and agreements e g projections of climate change impacts on global marine fisheries have shown the importance of meeting international targets to reduce emissions for both fisheries catch cheung et al 2016b and revenues lam et al 2016 there are a number of studies that provide projections of the potential oa impacts to marine fisheries through extensive literature reviews and risk analyses frameworks branch et al 2013 ekstrom et al 2015 le quesne and pinnegar 2012 mathis et al 2015 we envision the use of our results to develop a better understanding and potentially reducing the uncertainty with projecting oa impacts on living marine resources our results of scaling oa effects from physiology to population biogeography provide useful insight to the underlying uncertainties and sensitivities constructing projection models such as the one here requires sound theoretical and empirical information further progress in reducing uncertainties can be made with more integration across disciplines and communication between the inputs and outputs needed by experimental biologists ecologists and modellers for example data from ocean acidification and warming experiments were used in a projection model to estimate potential impacts to species distribution and abundance all in one synthesized paper queirós et al 2015 with accelerated oa and climate change leading to the emergence of more downstream consequences it is essential to continue to reduce uncertainties of projection models to help inform mitigation and adaptation strategies funding this work was funded by the social sciences and humanities research council sshrc of

25208,a good knowledge about species traits variability in relation to their environment is the cornerstone of landscape oriented species management studies one way to infer this relationship is to compare species signatures in space and time from field data with spatially explicit population dynamics models outputs however the inference robustness relies on the available field data and thus on the quality of the underlying sampling strategy field sampling is constrained by several factors such as the number of landscape replicates possible number of temporal sessions and number of sample locations that need to be accounted for prior to field sampling we set and illustrate a heuristic method to answer the question of optimal sampling conditioned by these landscape induced constraints first we studied a real agricultural landscape to determine its mean properties in terms of configuration and composition the real landscape properties were used as constraints in a landscape model to generate a collection of landscapes with similar properties on the other hand we formulated population dynamics models hereafter noted process models pm carrying competing hypotheses about two ecological processes population growth and dispersal in relation to spatial covariates for pterostichus melanarius a carabid species involved in pest regulation we simulated these spatially explicit models and extracted their sampling dependent signatures i e metrics computed on different population samples we defined a sampling design quality as its ability to capture the contrasts between the pm signatures summarised by the performance of a classification procedure the most relevant sampling design was selected on the basis of classification performance and in situ feasibility finally we explored the effects of the a priori ecological hypotheses quality on classification performances through a sensitivity analysis of the pm parameters while some improvements remain to be achieved before being fully operational for landscape ecologists our framework contributes to bringing closer sampling theory and its application on the field it endorses the use of landscape modelling to design sampling prior to field experiment to bring out the best from sampled data keywords ecological traits reaction diffusion models population patterns sampling designs classification algorithm landscape ecology 1 introduction one major ambition of applied ecology is to arrange the landscape structure for a purpose of population dynamics management in space and time turner 2005 this approach serves a wide variety of purposes such as conservation of endangered species and biodiversity management moloney and levin 1996 aben et al 2016 enhancement of ecosystem services landis et al 2000 jonsson et al 2014 parisey et al 2016 and control of invasive species jongejans et al 2008 savage and renton 2014 an increasingly used approach to tackle these thematics is the exploration of the effects of landscape scenarios on the population dynamics through landscape modelling schröder and seppelt 2006 in this approach a spatially explicit population model is simulated on landscapes presenting a gradient of one or several properties to be explored e g configurational or compositional heterogeneity sensu fahrig et al 2011 simulated population data are then characterised by spatial and or temporal metrics and conclusions are made about the landscape properties that better answer the ecological question at stake e g fahrig 1998 for a given species traits values e g movement reproduction and mortality rates depend on environmental variables such as amount and quality of feeding resources micro climatic conditions that are spatially heterogeneous at the landscape scale honek and jarosik 2000 holland and luff 2000 traits sensitivity to environmental variables however vary from one species to another and from one trait to another jackson and fahrig 2015 spatial heterogeneity of the environmental variables will thus generate different population patterns according to their impacts on the species life traits fahrig et al 2015 when attempting to determine the effect of landscape structure through spatially explicit modelling approach one has to include these processes both qualitatively i e which traits have to be included and are they sensitive to environmental heterogeneity and quantitatively what are the traits values with regard to the environmental variables schröder and seppelt 2006 unfortunately this knowledge is rarely available in the literature and hardly acquirable through experimentation both because quantifying movement or reproduction is technically difficult and that this quantification should be done along the whole environmental gradient this calls for alternative methods to determine the traits environment relationships while the traits environmental variables relationships are responsible for the population patterns in space and time it is reciprocally possible under some conditions to infer these processes from the analysis of population patterns fortin and dale 2005 grimm et al 2005 this assumption is a central theme of movement ecology avgar et al 2013 nathan 2008 and some studies successfully inferred the movement processes underlying population patterns mcintire et al 2013 for instance were able to determine the movement behaviour of a butterfly species by comparing population data from the field and data simulated by individual based models carrying different mechanistic hypotheses following the concept of strong inference initially formulated by platt 1964 two conditions need to be fulfilled to ensure the robustness of the ecological processes inference i multiple competing hypotheses about the processes must be formulated a priori johnson and omland 2004 and ii the experimental design effectively allows discriminating the competing hypotheses mcintire and fajardo 2009 platt 1964 in the discipline of landscape ecology where the experiment consists in sampling individuals in space and time this second condition means that the sampling must be designed such as the population patterns associated to different processes are contrasted enough to be distinguishable schweiger et al 2016 schröder and seppelt 2006 using such a design on the field thus ensures that the extracted pattern leads to the correct selection of the underlying ecological process conversely insufficient sampling may lead to a pattern description that is too coarse to disentangle the competing hypotheses formulated about the ecological processes mcintire and fajardo 2009 the question of optimal sampling design to unravel ecological processes from the population pattern has thus been of an increasing interest for the last four decades mateu and müller 2012 in this context zurell et al 2010 emphasised the exciting potential of the use of virtual population data to evaluate methods for data sampling naming this approach as the virtual ecologist methodology however to the best of our knowledge no methodological framework using simulated population data has been proposed to set up sampling over space and time with the specific objective of inferring the ecological processes driving a species dynamics from a set of a priori hypotheses defining the population signature as the censored information resulting from the sampling of a population spatio temporal patterns and based on the idea that ecological processes can be inferred from this signature tilman and kareiva 1997 tuda 2007 we propose a heuristic framework to address this methodological issue after presenting the general approach of our framework we illustrate its application through a real landscape based scenario to define a priori how sampling should be conducted to infer the ecological processes driving the population dynamics of a ground dwelling carabid species pterostichus melanarius among a set of competing hypotheses although p melanarius population distributions within the agroecosystem have been widely studied e g holland and begbie 2004 george thomas and holland 2002 considerable gaps in our knowledge remain and must be filled if we are to manipulate the farm habitat in its favour holland and luff 2000 for example knowledge related to its preferred habitat types remains unclear as well as the processes governing its heterogeneous distribution within and between fields holland and luff 2000 predicting population patterns in relation to landscape structure through an approach of landscape modelling cannot be conducted without such ecological knowledge jongejans et al 2008 schröder and seppelt 2006 we tackle this lack of knowledge about this key natural enemy species by formulating competing mechanistic hypotheses that are susceptible to drive its population dynamics within the agricultural landscape the goal of our study was to identify a priori sampling designs that would best allow selecting the correct ecological process at stake from the sampled data in turn we did not infer the ecological processes driving p melanarius population dynamics at the landscape scale rather we proposed a sampling design to do so in a real agricultural study area within the range of sampling efforts usually made for studies where carabid are sampled within agricultural landscapes the outputs of our study are i a proposition of sampling design in terms of number of sampling points number of sampling sessions in time and number of landscape replicates in which to sample ii the associated classification model to be used for ecological process inference on the basis of sampled data and iii the assessment of the population parameters uncertainty on the inference robustness through a sensitivity analysis framework finally we discuss the implications of such framework and what improvements remain to be done before being fully operational for ecologists that aim to infer ecological processes from the population signatures at the landscape scale 2 material and methods 2 1 general heuristic approach the general approach of our heuristic is illustrated in fig 1 it is designed to address the question of the optimal sampling strategies in order to maximise the ability to determine the biological traits environment relationships of the species of interest the approach involves four steps the first step consists in generating virtual landscapes presenting realistic structural properties the study area that is chosen for biological sampling is analysed and mean structural properties of the landscapes are extracted these properties are included as parameter values in a landscape model to generate spatial domains with targeted properties the second step is devoted to the generation of virtual population data it consists of formulating competing ecological hypotheses from the available knowledge about the species of interest translating them into mechanistic spatially explicit population dynamics models process models pms and simulating them on the virtual landscapes in the third step sampling designs differing in their spatial and temporal components s s s t s r respectively the numbers of sampling locations sampling dates and landscape replicates are applied to sample the simulated population data a set of summary statistics hereafter named signature φ are computed on sampled data for each sampling design defining the sampling dependent pm signatures for each sampling design the couples pm φ are used as inputs for a classification model that learns and predicts the pm as a function of their population signatures the classification accuracy defined as the rate of correct predictions of the pms from their signatures quantifies the sampling design quality a high accuracy means that the sampling design generates pm specific signatures that are easily distinguishable one from another using a classification model also allows to extract other information about the classification performances through the analysis of the confusion matrices for each sampling design such as type i and ii error rates respectively false positives and false negatives for each pm or their pairwise confusion which is a proxy towards pm signatures similarity such information quantifies the uncertainty associated with the classification of ecological processes from sampled data another valuable information is to describe the importance of the sampling components s s s t s r on classification performances and eventually predict the best way to distribute sampling components for any sampling effort e s s s t s r to do so a smoothing model is used to fit the relationship between classification accuracy and sampling components the fourth step consists of assessing the effect of uncertainty of the pms parameters on classification accuracy using a sensitivity analysis this ranks the parameters impact and sheds light on the parameters that have to be more carefully calibrated to ensure the reliability of the sampling design selection 2 2 definition of landscape model constraints and generation of virtual landscapes population patterns emerge from the interaction between the landscape structure and the ecological processes that take place within it fahrig et al 2011 within our framework where processes are discriminated on the basis of the differences between their population patterns we set aside the landscape structure caused variability of the patterns on the other hand we also sought to simulate the pm on landscapes presenting realistic properties in terms of composition and configuration we thus extracted the structural properties of a real landscape and included them as constraints into a landscape model to generate virtual landscapes sharing similar properties the studied domain is an agricultural area of approximately 130 km2 located in brittany zone atelier armorique north western france characterised by a sw ne gradient of landscape structure from hedged farmland woodlands and permanent grasslands high configurational heterogeneity to open fields low configurational heterogeneity see baudry et al 2000 for more details in 2011 the season under study here the area comprised around 75 agricultural surfaces almost equally distributed between one third of grasslands maize and winter wheat using floating windows of 300 m 300 m with a translation step of 75 m in latitude and longitude we scanned the study area to extract the landscape properties of habitat proportion and edge density ed a landscape scale index of the interface length between different habitat types expressed as m ha cushman et al 2008 the landscape extent is defined by the area spanned by p melanarius during its activity period approximately 9 104 ha alema 2014 holland et al 2005 we retained landscapes containing more than 95 of agricultural covers with the surface of maize winter wheat and prairie equally distributed i e 1 3 10 for each cover type ed vary from 38 m ha to 228 m ha with a mean value of 192 m ha 10 within these filtered landscapes we constructed a landscape model based on the tessellation of spatial point patterns to generate landscapes sharing the same properties in terms of composition and edge density values gaucherel 2008 le ber et al 2009 we chose the family of multitype strauss hardcore mshc point patterns as they allow for multiple types of marks land cover types hard core properties minimal distance between plot centroids and both symmetrical positive and negative spatial dependence within and between marks edelman 2012 we generated 12 virtual landscapes denoted ω1 12 obtained by solving the following optimisation problem 1 min

equiproportion is constrained the optimisation was performed using a multi level single linkage algorithm which is a global algorithm that uses simultaneous multi local starts within the parameter space at the local scale the search for optima was performed using a nelder mead algorithm 2 3 process models formulation and generation of population data the reaction diffusion formalism is suitable for modelling population dynamics with the possibility of accounting for spatial heterogeneity in the demography and or diffusion parameters shigesada and kawasaki 1997 roques et al 2008 we used this formalism to formulate seven process models pms with different responses to spatial heterogeneity habitat quality stands for the resources and conditions present in an area that produce occupancy including survival and reproduction by a given organism hall et al 1997 habitat quality can be represented by the carrying capacity parameter that implicitly accounts for factors such as amount and availability of resources or micro climatic conditions banks 1994 barros et al 2016 by giving it a spatially homogeneous respectively heterogeneous value one can represent habitat generalism respectively habitat specialism e g padrón and trevisan 2006 we thus modelled the reaction component using the verhulst logistic equation see e g banks 1994 huzimura and matsuyama 1999 possibly accounting for spatially heterogeneous habitat quality by setting a land cover dependent value for the carrying capacity the diffusion component was modelled by a fokker planck equation for models with spatially heterogeneous diffusion as it has proven robust for handling the population redistribution at habitat interfaces codling et al 2008 roques and chekroun 2010 bourhis et al 2017 for the models with spatially homogeneous diffusion the fokker planck diffusion simply writes as a fick diffusion i e the heat equation the general formulation of the reaction diffusion model reads 2 p x t t r p x t 1 p x t k x t δ x μ x t p x t with x standing for the two dimensional representation of space x y p x t the population density at location x and at time t r the per capita growth rate of population k x t the carrying capacity in x at time t μ x t the diffusion parameter over x and t often called motility when applied to the fokker planck diffusion alema 2014 finally δ x 2 x 2 2 y 2 is the laplace operator standing for the second derivatives in space i e the diffusion the pm formulations differ in the way their reaction and diffusion hereafter r and d respectively parameters k and μ depend on the land cover type we defined four modalities for each of the r and d components homogeneous and constant hc the considered parameter k or μ does not depend on the land cover type its value is set within the whole spatial domain and remains constant along with time inhomogeneous and constant ic the considered parameter k and or μ depends on the land cover type its value is a function of the land cover type and it remains constant along with time homogeneous and time varying hv the considered parameter k or μ does not depend on the land cover type its value is a decreasing exponential function of time null n there is no change in population size at the landscape scale or no population movements along the simulations by crossing the four reaction and four diffusion modalities and removing the non spatial formulations we formulated seven pm termed m i r j d i j n hc hv ic each of which represents a hypothesis on the traits environment relationship of the fictive carabid species for the sake of parsimony we chose not to represent an inhomogeneous and time varying modality as it would imply defining a functional to describe the changes of the carrying capacity and diffusion parameters in time and within each land cover for which information for the calibration is too scarce table 1 details the pm formulations the parameter values are given in table 2 the seven pms were simulated on the 12 virtual landscapes ω1 12 previously generated details on the numerical scheme used for the pm simulations are reported in appendix b 2 4 effect of the sampling design on ecological process inference 2 4 1 definition of the sampling designs we defined a sampling design s as the combination of three parameters s t the number of sampling sessions in time s s the number of sampling locations in space per land cover type and s r the number of landscape replicates within which the population samplings are applied the total sampling effort e is defined as the product of its spatial and temporal components e s t 3 s s s r aside from some exceptional sampling designs that involve a total effort of around 4000 points within a sampling campaign e g holland et al 2005 sampling designs involving carabid sampling rarely exceed around 1000 points bohan et al 2011 marrec et al 2015 we defined values for s t s s and s r so as the range of these feasible efforts is finely explored we extended this range up to e 21 600 points to explore a potential asymptotic effect of sampling on pm classification we thus defined the values of sampling parameters s t s s and s r as follows s t 1 2 3 5 10 s s 1 2 3 5 10 20 30 60 s r 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 giving a total of 320 sampling designs to be tested we sampled s s points at s t dates within the simulated population for each couple model landscape m ω we assumed a random stratified sampling for the location of the s s sampling points within a landscape i e s s points are randomly sampled within each of the three land cover types sampling dates s t are regularly distributed within the simulation time the s r landscape replicates were randomly taken out of the 12 ω domains we controlled random sampling so that every population returned by the pms were sampled at the same locations and within the same landscapes in order to take into account the stochasticity of the sampling locations each sampling was replicated 10 times 2 4 2 performance assessment and sampling design selection the key objective of our work is to search for sampling designs that maximise the contrasts between the signatures so that the pm underlying a new data sample can be selected with a minimal risk of error let y be the observation of a population data sample for which an underlying process pm is to be inferred from its descriptors φ a metrics vector describing the observation y the issue of selecting the ecological process pm from a set of a priori hypotheses pm m given its signature φ can be formalised as a classification issue the problem consists in inputting φ into a classification algorithm c that outputs q y pm m φ which is the probability that the observation y described by φ follows the ecological process pm m the selected process model pm ˆ for the dynamics y is then taken as the one with highest probability i e 3 y ˆ arg max q y i pm m φ m 1 m the ability to correctly classify y thus depends on the specificity of the descriptors φ with regard to the process model formally the classifier performances depend on the d dimensional distances between the probability density functions pdf f m φ that are the estimated probability density of the descriptor φ if the pm is m when the signatures of two pms are close their pdf overlap and thus the pms are hardly distinguishable for each sampling design s j j 1 320 we fitted a classifier c j on the population observations y j φ j sampled with s j the classification accuracy of the fitted classifier a c j was assessed by a k fold cross validation procedure hastie et al 2009 4 a c j 1 n j k 1 k i 1 n k y ik j ˆ y ik j n k with n j m s r s j the number of observations for the sampling design j k the number of cross validation folds n k the number of validation data observations in the fold k y ik j ˆ the predicted pm for the validation observation and y ik j the actual class of the validation observation the classifications were done using a multinomial logistic regression this regression is solved with a gradient boosting algorithm which combines decision trees and boosting i e combining many simple models to improve prediction for details about the procedure we refer the reader to friedman 2001 we derived the classifiers using the r package gbm version 2 1 06 the observation descriptor φ is a vector of 15 descriptive statistics computed on the sampled population datasets these descriptors are based on population means variances and extrema minimum or maximum population aggregated along time and or space and are thus global descriptors of the population at the landscape scale all over the sampling season while finer population descriptors could have been more relevant to make it easier the classification of the ecological processes we chose these metrics as they are conceptually simple and mimic the data pooling in space and time usually encountered in the literature involving carabid sampling tables 3 and 4 in appendix c detail the formulation of population metrics to further investigate the pm signatures similarity in relation with sampling design we also computed the pairwise confusion rate which is the sum of type i error incorrectly classifying pm i as pm m i m and type ii error incorrectly classifying pm m as pm i i m we selected the best sampling design s as the one that maximised the classification accuracy within the range of sampling efforts usually encountered in the literature e 1000 200 sampling designs the classification model associated with this sampling design is thereafter referred to as the reference classifier c 2 4 3 relative importance of sampling parameters on classification accuracy owing to the large number of possible combinations within the sampling parameter value ranges it might not be possible to test every sampling design for classification accuracy assessment smoothing models can be used to interpolate classification accuracies of untested designs and quantify the relative importance of the sampling parameters we used general additive models gams hastie and tibshirani 1990 to fit the relationship between the sampling design parameters and possibly their interactions and classification accuracy 5 g a f 1 s t f 2 s s f 3 s r f 4 s t s s f i s t s s s r where f i are smoothing functions of the variables s k k s t or r we first fitted all the possible models to be formulated from the sampling variables s t s s s r and their 2nd and 3rd order interactions with data smoothing function estimation was performed using penalised thin plate regression splines wood 2003 we then selected the model g as the one presenting the lowest akaike s information criterion aic johnson and omland 2004 2 5 effect of model calibration uncertainty on species traits inference the reaction and diffusion parameter values of the pms were derived from the literature and or expert knowledge and thus are likely to diverge from the values that govern population dynamics on the field consequently if a certain ecological process drives the species population in the field but with values differing from the ones we set for the a priori hypotheses the reference classifier might not be able to recognise its signature from the sampled data and mistake it for another process we wanted to assess the effect of an error in the parameter values on the classification accuracies let v 1 v p be the reference parameter values we set by expert knowledge and or literature and v 1 v p the parameter vector that would optimally describe the population dynamics on the field let y pm m v 1 v p and y pm m v 1 v p be the vectors combining the sampled observations of the population dynamics generated by these models and φ and φ their respective descriptors we want to assess the effect of the divergence between v and v on the loss of classification performances i e the risk of misclassification due to a wrong initial calibration of the process models formally we conducted a global sensitivity analysis of the pm parameters v 1 v p on the loss of classification accuracy we used the morris method morris 1991 to design the parameter space matrix v using a one at a time factorial design with 10 levels for each parameter a grid jump δ of 10 2 5 and h 30 trajectories leading to a table of n 420 parameter sets we simulated the process models and extracted the associated population data and calculated the loss of classification accuracy for each parameter set we computed the absolute mean μ and variance σ of the parameters elementary effects on the loss of classification accuracy to assess the parameters sensitivity details of the procedure are given in appendix d all the developments were done using gnu r the code sets for virtual landscape generation process model simulation virtual data sampling and process model classification are available on request 3 results 3 1 effect of sampling design the ability to distinguish the ecological hypotheses from each other approached by the classification accuracy strongly relies on the way sampling is conducted accuracy can be approximated as a logarithmic function of total sampling effort r 2 0 84 thus showing a dramatic increase within the range of realistic sampling efforts to reach a quasi asymptotic behaviour fig 2 at the same time variability of accuracy per sampling design decreases with the logarithm of total sampling effort r 2 0 65 on the global trend increasing sampling effort thus improves mean classification accuracy and reduces its variability for a given sampling effort different sampling designs lead to different mean accuracies especially for weak sampling efforts as an example for an effort of e 300 possibly reached with seven sampling designs mean accuracy ranges from 0 69 to 0 85 such variability shows the importance of wisely distributing sampling effort e between its components s t s s and s r on the other hand different ways of managing the effort might provide equivalent classification performances given the same example of sampling effort two sampling strategies allow getting an accuracy of a 0 85 either taking s t 2 s s 10 s r 5 or s t 2 s s 5 s r 10 getting a similar accuracy with different designs allow choosing the sampling strategy that best fulfils the sampling campaign constraints e g number of available landscape replicates or possible sampling dates the gam model used to fit the relationship between the sampling parameters and the classification accuracy explained 82 8 of the deviance the three sampling parameters including their 2nd and 3rd order interaction have a significant impact on classification accuracy all the predicted accuracies red dots in fig 2 all fall within the range of observed accuracies blue error bars on fig 2 ensuring its reliability to interpolate accuracies for untested designs the relative influence of the sampling parameters on the accuracy depends on the location in the 3 dimensional space s t s s s r as observable in fig 3 in turn the sampling parameter to be adjusted for a better classification depends on the current location of the sampling design in the parameter space if the total sampling effort is weak setting s s 5 and s s 1 is a necessary condition to get an accuracy above 0 75 interestingly a change in parameter value does not necessarily means an increase in classification performances for instance for a given value of s s and or s r an increase of s t from two to three results in a decrease in accuracy provided the impacts of sampling parameters on accuracy are non linear and interacting there is no rule of thumb for systematically prioritising a dimension rather than another however optimal sampling designs with regard to user defined sampling constraints can then be obtained by searching for local maxima of the fitted gam model some ecological processes generate close population signatures with each other making them harder to distinguish with each other pm pairwise confusion rate is a finer descriptor of classification performances it is calculated as the sum of type i error incorrectly classifying model a as another model and type ii error incorrectly classifying another model as model a it thus provides an information about how pm signatures are close to each other two pm exhibiting a high confusion have close signatures as the classification algorithm is not able to discriminate one from another fig 4 shows the pairwise distributions of confusion rate within the range of feasible efforts e 1000 the higher the confusion the most often are the two models mistaken one for another for a given sampling design for most of the pm couples confusion is null or weak within the feasible sampling effort meaning that they are never mistaken one for another or that when they are the error is low three couples however show non negligible confusion rates pm n ic pm hc ic pm n ic pm ic ic and pm ic hc pm ic hv this means their population signature is so close that their underlying processes are hardly distinguishable i e that the sampling design must be selected carefully to disentangle the associated hypotheses confusion rates between the pm pm ic hc pm ic hv never equal zero meaning that regardless of the sampling design within the range of feasible efforts these two processes can never be properly disentangled after this global analysis we focused on the most performing sampling design s mean accuracy a 0 95 sd 0 019 black diamond in fig 2 within the feasible sampling effort range the total sampling effort is 960 points distributed in s t 2 s s 20 and s r 8 its associated confusion table fig 5 is the tool to interpret the classification results once field data will be obtained summarised and be used as input data for the associated classification model the matrix diagonal gives the probability that the predicted model is the actual model governing population dynamics on the field i e true positives for instance if the classifier interprets the field signature as being originated by the ic hc process heterogeneous constant reaction homogeneous diffusion the probability that the real process is indeed ic hc is 0 84 and the probability to be mistaken for the ic hv process same reaction decreasing dispersal with time is 0 16 few or no confusion type i and ii errors 5 are associated with the five other pm 3 2 sensitivity analysis correct calibration appears to be crucial with regards to classification accuracy loss of classification accuracies showed a wide range of values along the exploration of the pm parameters space given by the morris plan ranging from 0 02 to 1 with a mean 0 52 and standard deviation 0 20 all parameters have a significant impact on the loss of classification accuracy fig 6 parameters with high μ values are the most important regarding linear and additive effects on the loss of classification accuracy whereas the ones with high σ values impact it non linearly and or with interactions with other parameters morris 1991 parameters sensitivity on the classification accuracy can be interpreted as their impact on the population dynamics a high sensitivity of a parameter means that a change in its value generates a population signature that is so different from the ones generated by the initial hypotheses that the reference classifier is not able to recognise it regarding this k 3 the carrying capacity defining the value of good quality habitats appears to be the most impacting parameter on population dynamics as it determines the carrying capacity of the largest reservoir of population it strongly drives the densities computed at the landscape scale μ 2 the diffusion value within low quality habitats i e the high value of the diffusion ability also appears to have a strong impact on classification accuracy and as an underlying cause on population dynamics this highlights the importance of the organism ability to leave the poor quality habitats on the population signature at the landscape scale the impact of these two parameters highlights the importance of acquiring a good knowledge either through literature or by conducting small scale abundance sampling about i what could be the good quality habitat in the landscape and to correctly quantify its carrying capacity and ii what is the maximum diffusion ability of the organism within the landscape the type i error rate provides information about how processes are mistaken one for another a type i error of e g 0 2 between pm i and pm j means there is a probability of 0 2 that the model pm i inferred from the field signature is actually the model pm j thus using such classification performance metric is a useful tool to reduce the number of ecological hypotheses formulated a priori accounting for the potential error in parameter values indeed if a model pm i gets a 0 type i error with model pm j regardless of the parameter values then pm j can be removed from the set of ecological hypotheses governing the species dynamics reading fig 7 row wise we can thus see that if pm hc ic is inferred from the field signature there is no chance that the actual process is pm ic hc pm ic hv or pm ic n regardless of the error associated with the parameter calibration the number of hypotheses is thus reduced from seven to four a further analysis of the confusion matrices would allow quantifying the risk of error associated with classifying pm hc ic as any of the remaining hypotheses this would be a relevant extension of our framework 4 discussion 4 1 summary and implications using a virtual ecologist approach zurell et al 2010 we set a heuristic method to define optimal sampling strategies with the specific objective of selecting mechanistic models from the censored data similar approaches were used to define sampling strategies to accurately parameterise species distribution models sdm that model and predict species spatial distributions from environmental variables e g albert et al 2010 proosdij et al 2016 these models rely on the correlation between the spatial distributions of the species and the environmental covariates usually at a single snapshot in time and assuming population equilibrium e g hirzel and guisan 2002 albert et al 2010 sampling modalities that are tested differ in sample size and in spatial configuration of the sampling locations e g random versus systematic sampling mechanistic assumptions are increasingly included to describe population dynamics cabral et al 2017 zurell 2017 chapman et al 2017 but to the best of our knowledge no methodological framework is clearly defined to guide sampling in space and time with the specific objective of selecting mechanistic models by virtually testing sampling strategies that differ in total sampling effort number of sampling dates locations and landscape replicates we define a novel approach that we hope can help field ecologists to better plan sampling at the landscape scale sampling quality is defined by its ability to extract the population signature so that it can be unambiguously related to a single ecological process this was approached by assessing the performances of a classification model fitted on the sampled data the higher the performances the easier the process specific signatures are distinguished by the classification model we showed that classification performances globally increase with total sampling effort within the range of usually encountered sampling efforts in studies involving carabid sampling within agricultural landscapes however the variability of classification performances underlines the importance of determining a priori the way to distribute the effort between its spatial and temporal components for a given effort several designs can bring similar classification performances the existence of alternative sampling strategies has valuable practical implications as it allows to choose the strategy that best matches the field constraints e g number of possible visits on the field or number of available landscape replicates on the study area we recommend sampling at several locations per landcover types s s 5 at more than a unique date to reach correct classification performances a 0 85 besides no rule of thumb about a sampling dimension to be systematically prioritized can be drawn however using the gam to set a surface response of accuracy as a function of sampling components allows for estimating local and global maxima while according to kenkel et al 1989 there is no panacea in ecological sampling our heuristic approach thus allows proposing an efficient design according to the sampling campaign constraints after selecting an example of efficient sampling design we questioned the sensitivity of the classification accuracy on the pm parameters in turn we showed the effect of the variation in pm parameters values on the loss in classification accuracy compared to the one obtained with the reference parameter set by doing so we indirectly showed the importance of the parameters in the formation of the population patterns for a sensitive parameter a discrepancy between its reference value and its actual value in the field will generate a discrepancy in the patterns such as the classifier is not able anymore to identify the underlying process sensitivity analysis is thus an important step as it discerns the parameters that need proper calibration because of their strong influence on population patterns the impact of uncertainty can then be quantified to assess whether coarse parameter estimates are tolerated or if experimental attempts towards better identification should be endeavoured with e g lab or microcosm experimentations alema 2014 we also showed that extracting finer classification metrics allows a better qualification of the similarities between the pm signature accounting for the uncertainty associated with the parameter values here again the risk of mistaking a process for another can be quantified and the number of competing ecological hypotheses can thus be reduced 4 2 working prospects and conclusion we built a heuristic allowing to determine how much to sample and how to distribute it between its spatial and temporal components if one is to tackle the issue of inferring the ecological processes driving a species dynamics as our method relies on process classification from the population patterns any way to better capture contrasts between patterns originating from different processes is likely to increase classification performances we identified two working prospects that are likely to increase classification performances for an equivalent sampling effort first we used summary statistics aggregated in space and time to describe the population patterns associated with the process models however summary statistics are essentially incomplete descriptions of the pattern hartig et al 2011 and thus the specificity of the patterns with respect to its underlying process might be less obvious than with a hypothetically complete description of the pattern as stressed by wiegand et al 2003 and grimm et al 2005 combining summary statistics that operate at different spatial and temporal scales e g per landcover type or per sampling date might increase the specificity of the pattern summary description with respect to the process and hence facilitate the model selection from the sampled data second the spatial distribution of sampling locations e g random or systematic sampling impacts the amount of information contained in the sampled data hirzel and guisan 2002 albert et al 2010 different designs in space can be virtually tested to determine which one best favours model selection zurell et al 2010 model based sampling however may provide a more case specific and robust determination of sampling locations albert et al 2010 by computing the distances between the populations densities p x t originating from the different process models it would be possible to target locations in x t that maximise the contrasts between the population signatures thus determining when and where to sample for robust model selection the major constraint of our heuristic is that it requires a certain amount of knowledge a priori about the species of interest to define i the a priori competing ecological hypotheses and ii the range of possible values for the process model parameters moreover it is not possible to ensure that the initial hypotheses include the process that is at stake in the field this is generally the case with hypotheses driven inductive studies holling and allen 2002 we start from the initial set of ecological hypotheses and assess whether one of them is more likely to explain the observed patterns if not i e if the fitted classifier does not manage to unambiguously classify the process from the observations the ecological hypotheses are refined or new ones emerge this heuristic is thus an iterative process between field and model where each step allows removing unsatisfactory hypotheses and build new ones that are more likely to explain observations platt 1964 johnson and omland 2004 in that sense our framework is applicable to any species for which i competing hypotheses exist about the processes driving the observed population patterns implying that population patterns for this species have been at least partially described and ii a minimal knowledge from experiment literature or expert based exists about the species such as ranges for the parameter values of the ecological process es of interest can be set an operational difficulty stems from the high variability in the structural properties of real landscapes as population patterns emerge from the interaction between landscape structure and ecological processes the disentanglement between process caused and structure caused variability in the population patterns is a complex necessity generally addressed by neutral landscape modelling with and king 1997 gaucherel 2008 turner and gardner 2015 using a best case scenario where landscape variability is low in terms of configuration we were able to identify sampling designs that theoretically favour model selection a short term perspective of our work is to implement our framework using representations of real landscapes instead of virtual ones to get a step closer to its application in the field another step towards field application is to incorporate observation models also known as virtual observer zurell et al 2010 or state space models patterson et al 2008 to our framework to mimic the process of observation and include its potential effects in the specific case of ground dwelling carabids which are usually sampled using pitfall traps population density cannot be directly drawn from the sampled data thomas et al 1998 a suite of methods and models are now available that allow to isolate the components of the so called activity density when sampling with this method e g zhao et al 2013 engel et al 2017 incorporating such methods to our framework will render it more readily applicable for field ecologists we claim that such modelling framework helping to design sampling strategies prior to field experiments should be the rule rather than the exception in addition to be cost saving such approach provides a design that is specifically adapted to the ecological question at stake and to the sampling constraints set by the user improving sampling leads to a better knowledge about the processes which in turn allows a more thorough formulation of mechanistic population models that is at last the necessary condition to build robust forecasting about the effect of landscape structure on population dynamics hence such framework should contribute to a better prediction

25208,a good knowledge about species traits variability in relation to their environment is the cornerstone of landscape oriented species management studies one way to infer this relationship is to compare species signatures in space and time from field data with spatially explicit population dynamics models outputs however the inference robustness relies on the available field data and thus on the quality of the underlying sampling strategy field sampling is constrained by several factors such as the number of landscape replicates possible number of temporal sessions and number of sample locations that need to be accounted for prior to field sampling we set and illustrate a heuristic method to answer the question of optimal sampling conditioned by these landscape induced constraints first we studied a real agricultural landscape to determine its mean properties in terms of configuration and composition the real landscape properties were used as constraints in a landscape model to generate a collection of landscapes with similar properties on the other hand we formulated population dynamics models hereafter noted process models pm carrying competing hypotheses about two ecological processes population growth and dispersal in relation to spatial covariates for pterostichus melanarius a carabid species involved in pest regulation we simulated these spatially explicit models and extracted their sampling dependent signatures i e metrics computed on different population samples we defined a sampling design quality as its ability to capture the contrasts between the pm signatures summarised by the performance of a classification procedure the most relevant sampling design was selected on the basis of classification performance and in situ feasibility finally we explored the effects of the a priori ecological hypotheses quality on classification performances through a sensitivity analysis of the pm parameters while some improvements remain to be achieved before being fully operational for landscape ecologists our framework contributes to bringing closer sampling theory and its application on the field it endorses the use of landscape modelling to design sampling prior to field experiment to bring out the best from sampled data keywords ecological traits reaction diffusion models population patterns sampling designs classification algorithm landscape ecology 1 introduction one major ambition of applied ecology is to arrange the landscape structure for a purpose of population dynamics management in space and time turner 2005 this approach serves a wide variety of purposes such as conservation of endangered species and biodiversity management moloney and levin 1996 aben et al 2016 enhancement of ecosystem services landis et al 2000 jonsson et al 2014 parisey et al 2016 and control of invasive species jongejans et al 2008 savage and renton 2014 an increasingly used approach to tackle these thematics is the exploration of the effects of landscape scenarios on the population dynamics through landscape modelling schröder and seppelt 2006 in this approach a spatially explicit population model is simulated on landscapes presenting a gradient of one or several properties to be explored e g configurational or compositional heterogeneity sensu fahrig et al 2011 simulated population data are then characterised by spatial and or temporal metrics and conclusions are made about the landscape properties that better answer the ecological question at stake e g fahrig 1998 for a given species traits values e g movement reproduction and mortality rates depend on environmental variables such as amount and quality of feeding resources micro climatic conditions that are spatially heterogeneous at the landscape scale honek and jarosik 2000 holland and luff 2000 traits sensitivity to environmental variables however vary from one species to another and from one trait to another jackson and fahrig 2015 spatial heterogeneity of the environmental variables will thus generate different population patterns according to their impacts on the species life traits fahrig et al 2015 when attempting to determine the effect of landscape structure through spatially explicit modelling approach one has to include these processes both qualitatively i e which traits have to be included and are they sensitive to environmental heterogeneity and quantitatively what are the traits values with regard to the environmental variables schröder and seppelt 2006 unfortunately this knowledge is rarely available in the literature and hardly acquirable through experimentation both because quantifying movement or reproduction is technically difficult and that this quantification should be done along the whole environmental gradient this calls for alternative methods to determine the traits environment relationships while the traits environmental variables relationships are responsible for the population patterns in space and time it is reciprocally possible under some conditions to infer these processes from the analysis of population patterns fortin and dale 2005 grimm et al 2005 this assumption is a central theme of movement ecology avgar et al 2013 nathan 2008 and some studies successfully inferred the movement processes underlying population patterns mcintire et al 2013 for instance were able to determine the movement behaviour of a butterfly species by comparing population data from the field and data simulated by individual based models carrying different mechanistic hypotheses following the concept of strong inference initially formulated by platt 1964 two conditions need to be fulfilled to ensure the robustness of the ecological processes inference i multiple competing hypotheses about the processes must be formulated a priori johnson and omland 2004 and ii the experimental design effectively allows discriminating the competing hypotheses mcintire and fajardo 2009 platt 1964 in the discipline of landscape ecology where the experiment consists in sampling individuals in space and time this second condition means that the sampling must be designed such as the population patterns associated to different processes are contrasted enough to be distinguishable schweiger et al 2016 schröder and seppelt 2006 using such a design on the field thus ensures that the extracted pattern leads to the correct selection of the underlying ecological process conversely insufficient sampling may lead to a pattern description that is too coarse to disentangle the competing hypotheses formulated about the ecological processes mcintire and fajardo 2009 the question of optimal sampling design to unravel ecological processes from the population pattern has thus been of an increasing interest for the last four decades mateu and müller 2012 in this context zurell et al 2010 emphasised the exciting potential of the use of virtual population data to evaluate methods for data sampling naming this approach as the virtual ecologist methodology however to the best of our knowledge no methodological framework using simulated population data has been proposed to set up sampling over space and time with the specific objective of inferring the ecological processes driving a species dynamics from a set of a priori hypotheses defining the population signature as the censored information resulting from the sampling of a population spatio temporal patterns and based on the idea that ecological processes can be inferred from this signature tilman and kareiva 1997 tuda 2007 we propose a heuristic framework to address this methodological issue after presenting the general approach of our framework we illustrate its application through a real landscape based scenario to define a priori how sampling should be conducted to infer the ecological processes driving the population dynamics of a ground dwelling carabid species pterostichus melanarius among a set of competing hypotheses although p melanarius population distributions within the agroecosystem have been widely studied e g holland and begbie 2004 george thomas and holland 2002 considerable gaps in our knowledge remain and must be filled if we are to manipulate the farm habitat in its favour holland and luff 2000 for example knowledge related to its preferred habitat types remains unclear as well as the processes governing its heterogeneous distribution within and between fields holland and luff 2000 predicting population patterns in relation to landscape structure through an approach of landscape modelling cannot be conducted without such ecological knowledge jongejans et al 2008 schröder and seppelt 2006 we tackle this lack of knowledge about this key natural enemy species by formulating competing mechanistic hypotheses that are susceptible to drive its population dynamics within the agricultural landscape the goal of our study was to identify a priori sampling designs that would best allow selecting the correct ecological process at stake from the sampled data in turn we did not infer the ecological processes driving p melanarius population dynamics at the landscape scale rather we proposed a sampling design to do so in a real agricultural study area within the range of sampling efforts usually made for studies where carabid are sampled within agricultural landscapes the outputs of our study are i a proposition of sampling design in terms of number of sampling points number of sampling sessions in time and number of landscape replicates in which to sample ii the associated classification model to be used for ecological process inference on the basis of sampled data and iii the assessment of the population parameters uncertainty on the inference robustness through a sensitivity analysis framework finally we discuss the implications of such framework and what improvements remain to be done before being fully operational for ecologists that aim to infer ecological processes from the population signatures at the landscape scale 2 material and methods 2 1 general heuristic approach the general approach of our heuristic is illustrated in fig 1 it is designed to address the question of the optimal sampling strategies in order to maximise the ability to determine the biological traits environment relationships of the species of interest the approach involves four steps the first step consists in generating virtual landscapes presenting realistic structural properties the study area that is chosen for biological sampling is analysed and mean structural properties of the landscapes are extracted these properties are included as parameter values in a landscape model to generate spatial domains with targeted properties the second step is devoted to the generation of virtual population data it consists of formulating competing ecological hypotheses from the available knowledge about the species of interest translating them into mechanistic spatially explicit population dynamics models process models pms and simulating them on the virtual landscapes in the third step sampling designs differing in their spatial and temporal components s s s t s r respectively the numbers of sampling locations sampling dates and landscape replicates are applied to sample the simulated population data a set of summary statistics hereafter named signature φ are computed on sampled data for each sampling design defining the sampling dependent pm signatures for each sampling design the couples pm φ are used as inputs for a classification model that learns and predicts the pm as a function of their population signatures the classification accuracy defined as the rate of correct predictions of the pms from their signatures quantifies the sampling design quality a high accuracy means that the sampling design generates pm specific signatures that are easily distinguishable one from another using a classification model also allows to extract other information about the classification performances through the analysis of the confusion matrices for each sampling design such as type i and ii error rates respectively false positives and false negatives for each pm or their pairwise confusion which is a proxy towards pm signatures similarity such information quantifies the uncertainty associated with the classification of ecological processes from sampled data another valuable information is to describe the importance of the sampling components s s s t s r on classification performances and eventually predict the best way to distribute sampling components for any sampling effort e s s s t s r to do so a smoothing model is used to fit the relationship between classification accuracy and sampling components the fourth step consists of assessing the effect of uncertainty of the pms parameters on classification accuracy using a sensitivity analysis this ranks the parameters impact and sheds light on the parameters that have to be more carefully calibrated to ensure the reliability of the sampling design selection 2 2 definition of landscape model constraints and generation of virtual landscapes population patterns emerge from the interaction between the landscape structure and the ecological processes that take place within it fahrig et al 2011 within our framework where processes are discriminated on the basis of the differences between their population patterns we set aside the landscape structure caused variability of the patterns on the other hand we also sought to simulate the pm on landscapes presenting realistic properties in terms of composition and configuration we thus extracted the structural properties of a real landscape and included them as constraints into a landscape model to generate virtual landscapes sharing similar properties the studied domain is an agricultural area of approximately 130 km2 located in brittany zone atelier armorique north western france characterised by a sw ne gradient of landscape structure from hedged farmland woodlands and permanent grasslands high configurational heterogeneity to open fields low configurational heterogeneity see baudry et al 2000 for more details in 2011 the season under study here the area comprised around 75 agricultural surfaces almost equally distributed between one third of grasslands maize and winter wheat using floating windows of 300 m 300 m with a translation step of 75 m in latitude and longitude we scanned the study area to extract the landscape properties of habitat proportion and edge density ed a landscape scale index of the interface length between different habitat types expressed as m ha cushman et al 2008 the landscape extent is defined by the area spanned by p melanarius during its activity period approximately 9 104 ha alema 2014 holland et al 2005 we retained landscapes containing more than 95 of agricultural covers with the surface of maize winter wheat and prairie equally distributed i e 1 3 10 for each cover type ed vary from 38 m ha to 228 m ha with a mean value of 192 m ha 10 within these filtered landscapes we constructed a landscape model based on the tessellation of spatial point patterns to generate landscapes sharing the same properties in terms of composition and edge density values gaucherel 2008 le ber et al 2009 we chose the family of multitype strauss hardcore mshc point patterns as they allow for multiple types of marks land cover types hard core properties minimal distance between plot centroids and both symmetrical positive and negative spatial dependence within and between marks edelman 2012 we generated 12 virtual landscapes denoted ω1 12 obtained by solving the following optimisation problem 1 min ν ed ˆ x ν ed 2 u 1 u p u ˆ x ν p u 2 with u number of land cover types x point pattern obtained from the mshc model ν landscape model parameter vector p u ˆ surface proportion of the land cover type u in the generated landscape ed targeted edge density value here 192 m ha ed ˆ edge density m ha value in the generated landscape p u targeted surface proportion of the land cover type u here 1 3 as equiproportion is constrained the optimisation was performed using a multi level single linkage algorithm which is a global algorithm that uses simultaneous multi local starts within the parameter space at the local scale the search for optima was performed using a nelder mead algorithm 2 3 process models formulation and generation of population data the reaction diffusion formalism is suitable for modelling population dynamics with the possibility of accounting for spatial heterogeneity in the demography and or diffusion parameters shigesada and kawasaki 1997 roques et al 2008 we used this formalism to formulate seven process models pms with different responses to spatial heterogeneity habitat quality stands for the resources and conditions present in an area that produce occupancy including survival and reproduction by a given organism hall et al 1997 habitat quality can be represented by the carrying capacity parameter that implicitly accounts for factors such as amount and availability of resources or micro climatic conditions banks 1994 barros et al 2016 by giving it a spatially homogeneous respectively heterogeneous value one can represent habitat generalism respectively habitat specialism e g padrón and trevisan 2006 we thus modelled the reaction component using the verhulst logistic equation see e g banks 1994 huzimura and matsuyama 1999 possibly accounting for spatially heterogeneous habitat quality by setting a land cover dependent value for the carrying capacity the diffusion component was modelled by a fokker planck equation for models with spatially heterogeneous diffusion as it has proven robust for handling the population redistribution at habitat interfaces codling et al 2008 roques and chekroun 2010 bourhis et al 2017 for the models with spatially homogeneous diffusion the fokker planck diffusion simply writes as a fick diffusion i e the heat equation the general formulation of the reaction diffusion model reads 2 p x t t r p x t 1 p x t k x t δ x μ x t p x t with x standing for the two dimensional representation of space x y p x t the population density at location x and at time t r the per capita growth rate of population k x t the carrying capacity in x at time t μ x t the diffusion parameter over x and t often called motility when applied to the fokker planck diffusion alema 2014 finally δ x 2 x 2 2 y 2 is the laplace operator standing for the second derivatives in space i e the diffusion the pm formulations differ in the way their reaction and diffusion hereafter r and d respectively parameters k and μ depend on the land cover type we defined four modalities for each of the r and d components homogeneous and constant hc the considered parameter k or μ does not depend on the land cover type its value is set within the whole spatial domain and remains constant along with time inhomogeneous and constant ic the considered parameter k and or μ depends on the land cover type its value is a function of the land cover type and it remains constant along with time homogeneous and time varying hv the considered parameter k or μ does not depend on the land cover type its value is a decreasing exponential function of time null n there is no change in population size at the landscape scale or no population movements along the simulations by crossing the four reaction and four diffusion modalities and removing the non spatial formulations we formulated seven pm termed m i r j d i j n hc hv ic each of which represents a hypothesis on the traits environment relationship of the fictive carabid species for the sake of parsimony we chose not to represent an inhomogeneous and time varying modality as it would imply defining a functional to describe the changes of the carrying capacity and diffusion parameters in time and within each land cover for which information for the calibration is too scarce table 1 details the pm formulations the parameter values are given in table 2 the seven pms were simulated on the 12 virtual landscapes ω1 12 previously generated details on the numerical scheme used for the pm simulations are reported in appendix b 2 4 effect of the sampling design on ecological process inference 2 4 1 definition of the sampling designs we defined a sampling design s as the combination of three parameters s t the number of sampling sessions in time s s the number of sampling locations in space per land cover type and s r the number of landscape replicates within which the population samplings are applied the total sampling effort e is defined as the product of its spatial and temporal components e s t 3 s s s r aside from some exceptional sampling designs that involve a total effort of around 4000 points within a sampling campaign e g holland et al 2005 sampling designs involving carabid sampling rarely exceed around 1000 points bohan et al 2011 marrec et al 2015 we defined values for s t s s and s r so as the range of these feasible efforts is finely explored we extended this range up to e 21 600 points to explore a potential asymptotic effect of sampling on pm classification we thus defined the values of sampling parameters s t s s and s r as follows s t 1 2 3 5 10 s s 1 2 3 5 10 20 30 60 s r 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 giving a total of 320 sampling designs to be tested we sampled s s points at s t dates within the simulated population for each couple model landscape m ω we assumed a random stratified sampling for the location of the s s sampling points within a landscape i e s s points are randomly sampled within each of the three land cover types sampling dates s t are regularly distributed within the simulation time the s r landscape replicates were randomly taken out of the 12 ω domains we controlled random sampling so that every population returned by the pms were sampled at the same locations and within the same landscapes in order to take into account the stochasticity of the sampling locations each sampling was replicated 10 times 2 4 2 performance assessment and sampling design selection the key objective of our work is to search for sampling designs that maximise the contrasts between the signatures so that the pm underlying a new data sample can be selected with a minimal risk of error let y be the observation of a population data sample for which an underlying process pm is to be inferred from its descriptors φ a metrics vector describing the observation y the issue of selecting the ecological process pm from a set of a priori hypotheses pm m given its signature φ can be formalised as a classification issue the problem consists in inputting φ into a classification algorithm c that outputs q y pm m φ which is the probability that the observation y described by φ follows the ecological process pm m the selected process model pm ˆ for the dynamics y is then taken as the one with highest probability i e 3 y ˆ arg max q y i pm m φ m 1 m the ability to correctly classify y thus depends on the specificity of the descriptors φ with regard to the process model formally the classifier performances depend on the d dimensional distances between the probability density functions pdf f m φ that are the estimated probability density of the descriptor φ if the pm is m when the signatures of two pms are close their pdf overlap and thus the pms are hardly distinguishable for each sampling design s j j 1 320 we fitted a classifier c j on the population observations y j φ j sampled with s j the classification accuracy of the fitted classifier a c j was assessed by a k fold cross validation procedure hastie et al 2009 4 a c j 1 n j k 1 k i 1 n k y ik j ˆ y ik j n k with n j m s r s j the number of observations for the sampling design j k the number of cross validation folds n k the number of validation data observations in the fold k y ik j ˆ the predicted pm for the validation observation and y ik j the actual class of the validation observation the classifications were done using a multinomial logistic regression this regression is solved with a gradient boosting algorithm which combines decision trees and boosting i e combining many simple models to improve prediction for details about the procedure we refer the reader to friedman 2001 we derived the classifiers using the r package gbm version 2 1 06 the observation descriptor φ is a vector of 15 descriptive statistics computed on the sampled population datasets these descriptors are based on population means variances and extrema minimum or maximum population aggregated along time and or space and are thus global descriptors of the population at the landscape scale all over the sampling season while finer population descriptors could have been more relevant to make it easier the classification of the ecological processes we chose these metrics as they are conceptually simple and mimic the data pooling in space and time usually encountered in the literature involving carabid sampling tables 3 and 4 in appendix c detail the formulation of population metrics to further investigate the pm signatures similarity in relation with sampling design we also computed the pairwise confusion rate which is the sum of type i error incorrectly classifying pm i as pm m i m and type ii error incorrectly classifying pm m as pm i i m we selected the best sampling design s as the one that maximised the classification accuracy within the range of sampling efforts usually encountered in the literature e 1000 200 sampling designs the classification model associated with this sampling design is thereafter referred to as the reference classifier c 2 4 3 relative importance of sampling parameters on classification accuracy owing to the large number of possible combinations within the sampling parameter value ranges it might not be possible to test every sampling design for classification accuracy assessment smoothing models can be used to interpolate classification accuracies of untested designs and quantify the relative importance of the sampling parameters we used general additive models gams hastie and tibshirani 1990 to fit the relationship between the sampling design parameters and possibly their interactions and classification accuracy 5 g a f 1 s t f 2 s s f 3 s r f 4 s t s s f i s t s s s r where f i are smoothing functions of the variables s k k s t or r we first fitted all the possible models to be formulated from the sampling variables s t s s s r and their 2nd and 3rd order interactions with data smoothing function estimation was performed using penalised thin plate regression splines wood 2003 we then selected the model g as the one presenting the lowest akaike s information criterion aic johnson and omland 2004 2 5 effect of model calibration uncertainty on species traits inference the reaction and diffusion parameter values of the pms were derived from the literature and or expert knowledge and thus are likely to diverge from the values that govern population dynamics on the field consequently if a certain ecological process drives the species population in the field but with values differing from the ones we set for the a priori hypotheses the reference classifier might not be able to recognise its signature from the sampled data and mistake it for another process we wanted to assess the effect of an error in the parameter values on the classification accuracies let v 1 v p be the reference parameter values we set by expert knowledge and or literature and v 1 v p the parameter vector that would optimally describe the population dynamics on the field let y pm m v 1 v p and y pm m v 1 v p be the vectors combining the sampled observations of the population dynamics generated by these models and φ and φ their respective descriptors we want to assess the effect of the divergence between v and v on the loss of classification performances i e the risk of misclassification due to a wrong initial calibration of the process models formally we conducted a global sensitivity analysis of the pm parameters v 1 v p on the loss of classification accuracy we used the morris method morris 1991 to design the parameter space matrix v using a one at a time factorial design with 10 levels for each parameter a grid jump δ of 10 2 5 and h 30 trajectories leading to a table of n 420 parameter sets we simulated the process models and extracted the associated population data and calculated the loss of classification accuracy for each parameter set we computed the absolute mean μ and variance σ of the parameters elementary effects on the loss of classification accuracy to assess the parameters sensitivity details of the procedure are given in appendix d all the developments were done using gnu r the code sets for virtual landscape generation process model simulation virtual data sampling and process model classification are available on request 3 results 3 1 effect of sampling design the ability to distinguish the ecological hypotheses from each other approached by the classification accuracy strongly relies on the way sampling is conducted accuracy can be approximated as a logarithmic function of total sampling effort r 2 0 84 thus showing a dramatic increase within the range of realistic sampling efforts to reach a quasi asymptotic behaviour fig 2 at the same time variability of accuracy per sampling design decreases with the logarithm of total sampling effort r 2 0 65 on the global trend increasing sampling effort thus improves mean classification accuracy and reduces its variability for a given sampling effort different sampling designs lead to different mean accuracies especially for weak sampling efforts as an example for an effort of e 300 possibly reached with seven sampling designs mean accuracy ranges from 0 69 to 0 85 such variability shows the importance of wisely distributing sampling effort e between its components s t s s and s r on the other hand different ways of managing the effort might provide equivalent classification performances given the same example of sampling effort two sampling strategies allow getting an accuracy of a 0 85 either taking s t 2 s s 10 s r 5 or s t 2 s s 5 s r 10 getting a similar accuracy with different designs allow choosing the sampling strategy that best fulfils the sampling campaign constraints e g number of available landscape replicates or possible sampling dates the gam model used to fit the relationship between the sampling parameters and the classification accuracy explained 82 8 of the deviance the three sampling parameters including their 2nd and 3rd order interaction have a significant impact on classification accuracy all the predicted accuracies red dots in fig 2 all fall within the range of observed accuracies blue error bars on fig 2 ensuring its reliability to interpolate accuracies for untested designs the relative influence of the sampling parameters on the accuracy depends on the location in the 3 dimensional space s t s s s r as observable in fig 3 in turn the sampling parameter to be adjusted for a better classification depends on the current location of the sampling design in the parameter space if the total sampling effort is weak setting s s 5 and s s 1 is a necessary condition to get an accuracy above 0 75 interestingly a change in parameter value does not necessarily means an increase in classification performances for instance for a given value of s s and or s r an increase of s t from two to three results in a decrease in accuracy provided the impacts of sampling parameters on accuracy are non linear and interacting there is no rule of thumb for systematically prioritising a dimension rather than another however optimal sampling designs with regard to user defined sampling constraints can then be obtained by searching for local maxima of the fitted gam model some ecological processes generate close population signatures with each other making them harder to distinguish with each other pm pairwise confusion rate is a finer descriptor of classification performances it is calculated as the sum of type i error incorrectly classifying model a as another model and type ii error incorrectly classifying another model as model a it thus provides an information about how pm signatures are close to each other two pm exhibiting a high confusion have close signatures as the classification algorithm is not able to discriminate one from another fig 4 shows the pairwise distributions of confusion rate within the range of feasible efforts e 1000 the higher the confusion the most often are the two models mistaken one for another for a given sampling design for most of the pm couples confusion is null or weak within the feasible sampling effort meaning that they are never mistaken one for another or that when they are the error is low three couples however show non negligible confusion rates pm n ic pm hc ic pm n ic pm ic ic and pm ic hc pm ic hv this means their population signature is so close that their underlying processes are hardly distinguishable i e that the sampling design must be selected carefully to disentangle the associated hypotheses confusion rates between the pm pm ic hc pm ic hv never equal zero meaning that regardless of the sampling design within the range of feasible efforts these two processes can never be properly disentangled after this global analysis we focused on the most performing sampling design s mean accuracy a 0 95 sd 0 019 black diamond in fig 2 within the feasible sampling effort range the total sampling effort is 960 points distributed in s t 2 s s 20 and s r 8 its associated confusion table fig 5 is the tool to interpret the classification results once field data will be obtained summarised and be used as input data for the associated classification model the matrix diagonal gives the probability that the predicted model is the actual model governing population dynamics on the field i e true positives for instance if the classifier interprets the field signature as being originated by the ic hc process heterogeneous constant reaction homogeneous diffusion the probability that the real process is indeed ic hc is 0 84 and the probability to be mistaken for the ic hv process same reaction decreasing dispersal with time is 0 16 few or no confusion type i and ii errors 5 are associated with the five other pm 3 2 sensitivity analysis correct calibration appears to be crucial with regards to classification accuracy loss of classification accuracies showed a wide range of values along the exploration of the pm parameters space given by the morris plan ranging from 0 02 to 1 with a mean 0 52 and standard deviation 0 20 all parameters have a significant impact on the loss of classification accuracy fig 6 parameters with high μ values are the most important regarding linear and additive effects on the loss of classification accuracy whereas the ones with high σ values impact it non linearly and or with interactions with other parameters morris 1991 parameters sensitivity on the classification accuracy can be interpreted as their impact on the population dynamics a high sensitivity of a parameter means that a change in its value generates a population signature that is so different from the ones generated by the initial hypotheses that the reference classifier is not able to recognise it regarding this k 3 the carrying capacity defining the value of good quality habitats appears to be the most impacting parameter on population dynamics as it determines the carrying capacity of the largest reservoir of population it strongly drives the densities computed at the landscape scale μ 2 the diffusion value within low quality habitats i e the high value of the diffusion ability also appears to have a strong impact on classification accuracy and as an underlying cause on population dynamics this highlights the importance of the organism ability to leave the poor quality habitats on the population signature at the landscape scale the impact of these two parameters highlights the importance of acquiring a good knowledge either through literature or by conducting small scale abundance sampling about i what could be the good quality habitat in the landscape and to correctly quantify its carrying capacity and ii what is the maximum diffusion ability of the organism within the landscape the type i error rate provides information about how processes are mistaken one for another a type i error of e g 0 2 between pm i and pm j means there is a probability of 0 2 that the model pm i inferred from the field signature is actually the model pm j thus using such classification performance metric is a useful tool to reduce the number of ecological hypotheses formulated a priori accounting for the potential error in parameter values indeed if a model pm i gets a 0 type i error with model pm j regardless of the parameter values then pm j can be removed from the set of ecological hypotheses governing the species dynamics reading fig 7 row wise we can thus see that if pm hc ic is inferred from the field signature there is no chance that the actual process is pm ic hc pm ic hv or pm ic n regardless of the error associated with the parameter calibration the number of hypotheses is thus reduced from seven to four a further analysis of the confusion matrices would allow quantifying the risk of error associated with classifying pm hc ic as any of the remaining hypotheses this would be a relevant extension of our framework 4 discussion 4 1 summary and implications using a virtual ecologist approach zurell et al 2010 we set a heuristic method to define optimal sampling strategies with the specific objective of selecting mechanistic models from the censored data similar approaches were used to define sampling strategies to accurately parameterise species distribution models sdm that model and predict species spatial distributions from environmental variables e g albert et al 2010 proosdij et al 2016 these models rely on the correlation between the spatial distributions of the species and the environmental covariates usually at a single snapshot in time and assuming population equilibrium e g hirzel and guisan 2002 albert et al 2010 sampling modalities that are tested differ in sample size and in spatial configuration of the sampling locations e g random versus systematic sampling mechanistic assumptions are increasingly included to describe population dynamics cabral et al 2017 zurell 2017 chapman et al 2017 but to the best of our knowledge no methodological framework is clearly defined to guide sampling in space and time with the specific objective of selecting mechanistic models by virtually testing sampling strategies that differ in total sampling effort number of sampling dates locations and landscape replicates we define a novel approach that we hope can help field ecologists to better plan sampling at the landscape scale sampling quality is defined by its ability to extract the population signature so that it can be unambiguously related to a single ecological process this was approached by assessing the performances of a classification model fitted on the sampled data the higher the performances the easier the process specific signatures are distinguished by the classification model we showed that classification performances globally increase with total sampling effort within the range of usually encountered sampling efforts in studies involving carabid sampling within agricultural landscapes however the variability of classification performances underlines the importance of determining a priori the way to distribute the effort between its spatial and temporal components for a given effort several designs can bring similar classification performances the existence of alternative sampling strategies has valuable practical implications as it allows to choose the strategy that best matches the field constraints e g number of possible visits on the field or number of available landscape replicates on the study area we recommend sampling at several locations per landcover types s s 5 at more than a unique date to reach correct classification performances a 0 85 besides no rule of thumb about a sampling dimension to be systematically prioritized can be drawn however using the gam to set a surface response of accuracy as a function of sampling components allows for estimating local and global maxima while according to kenkel et al 1989 there is no panacea in ecological sampling our heuristic approach thus allows proposing an efficient design according to the sampling campaign constraints after selecting an example of efficient sampling design we questioned the sensitivity of the classification accuracy on the pm parameters in turn we showed the effect of the variation in pm parameters values on the loss in classification accuracy compared to the one obtained with the reference parameter set by doing so we indirectly showed the importance of the parameters in the formation of the population patterns for a sensitive parameter a discrepancy between its reference value and its actual value in the field will generate a discrepancy in the patterns such as the classifier is not able anymore to identify the underlying process sensitivity analysis is thus an important step as it discerns the parameters that need proper calibration because of their strong influence on population patterns the impact of uncertainty can then be quantified to assess whether coarse parameter estimates are tolerated or if experimental attempts towards better identification should be endeavoured with e g lab or microcosm experimentations alema 2014 we also showed that extracting finer classification metrics allows a better qualification of the similarities between the pm signature accounting for the uncertainty associated with the parameter values here again the risk of mistaking a process for another can be quantified and the number of competing ecological hypotheses can thus be reduced 4 2 working prospects and conclusion we built a heuristic allowing to determine how much to sample and how to distribute it between its spatial and temporal components if one is to tackle the issue of inferring the ecological processes driving a species dynamics as our method relies on process classification from the population patterns any way to better capture contrasts between patterns originating from different processes is likely to increase classification performances we identified two working prospects that are likely to increase classification performances for an equivalent sampling effort first we used summary statistics aggregated in space and time to describe the population patterns associated with the process models however summary statistics are essentially incomplete descriptions of the pattern hartig et al 2011 and thus the specificity of the patterns with respect to its underlying process might be less obvious than with a hypothetically complete description of the pattern as stressed by wiegand et al 2003 and grimm et al 2005 combining summary statistics that operate at different spatial and temporal scales e g per landcover type or per sampling date might increase the specificity of the pattern summary description with respect to the process and hence facilitate the model selection from the sampled data second the spatial distribution of sampling locations e g random or systematic sampling impacts the amount of information contained in the sampled data hirzel and guisan 2002 albert et al 2010 different designs in space can be virtually tested to determine which one best favours model selection zurell et al 2010 model based sampling however may provide a more case specific and robust determination of sampling locations albert et al 2010 by computing the distances between the populations densities p x t originating from the different process models it would be possible to target locations in x t that maximise the contrasts between the population signatures thus determining when and where to sample for robust model selection the major constraint of our heuristic is that it requires a certain amount of knowledge a priori about the species of interest to define i the a priori competing ecological hypotheses and ii the range of possible values for the process model parameters moreover it is not possible to ensure that the initial hypotheses include the process that is at stake in the field this is generally the case with hypotheses driven inductive studies holling and allen 2002 we start from the initial set of ecological hypotheses and assess whether one of them is more likely to explain the observed patterns if not i e if the fitted classifier does not manage to unambiguously classify the process from the observations the ecological hypotheses are refined or new ones emerge this heuristic is thus an iterative process between field and model where each step allows removing unsatisfactory hypotheses and build new ones that are more likely to explain observations platt 1964 johnson and omland 2004 in that sense our framework is applicable to any species for which i competing hypotheses exist about the processes driving the observed population patterns implying that population patterns for this species have been at least partially described and ii a minimal knowledge from experiment literature or expert based exists about the species such as ranges for the parameter values of the ecological process es of interest can be set an operational difficulty stems from the high variability in the structural properties of real landscapes as population patterns emerge from the interaction between landscape structure and ecological processes the disentanglement between process caused and structure caused variability in the population patterns is a complex necessity generally addressed by neutral landscape modelling with and king 1997 gaucherel 2008 turner and gardner 2015 using a best case scenario where landscape variability is low in terms of configuration we were able to identify sampling designs that theoretically favour model selection a short term perspective of our work is to implement our framework using representations of real landscapes instead of virtual ones to get a step closer to its application in the field another step towards field application is to incorporate observation models also known as virtual observer zurell et al 2010 or state space models patterson et al 2008 to our framework to mimic the process of observation and include its potential effects in the specific case of ground dwelling carabids which are usually sampled using pitfall traps population density cannot be directly drawn from the sampled data thomas et al 1998 a suite of methods and models are now available that allow to isolate the components of the so called activity density when sampling with this method e g zhao et al 2013 engel et al 2017 incorporating such methods to our framework will render it more readily applicable for field ecologists we claim that such modelling framework helping to design sampling strategies prior to field experiments should be the rule rather than the exception in addition to be cost saving such approach provides a design that is specifically adapted to the ecological question at stake and to the sampling constraints set by the user improving sampling leads to a better knowledge about the processes which in turn allows a more thorough formulation of mechanistic population models that is at last the necessary condition to build robust forecasting about the effect of landscape structure on population dynamics hence such framework should contribute to a better prediction of species distributions under the exploration of landscape scenarios and thus provide a sounder basis for landscape based species management studies acknowledgements b bellot s ph d was supported by

capacities for the pms with inhomogeneous reaction k 1 k 2 and k 3 were set to 0 1 0 55 and 1 respectively low mid and high quality habitat the other reaction parameters were set such as the integral

25209,ecological network analysis is an important tool for urban energy metabolism research but it does not consider the dynamic and synergy features of the system which constraints its application in urban transition studies in this paper we modified the ecological network analysis method to identify the key factors that dominate the evolution of the urban energy metabolism focusing on the dynamic and synergy characteristics of the system we observed the changes of direct and indirect energy consumption flows and combined with haken model to determine the dominant factors of the metabolic processes a case study on beijing was conducted to diagnose the key flows that impact the evolution of beijing s energy metabolic system during 2010 2015 results suggest that despite the decline in beijing s coal consumptions the direct and indirect parts have different tendency among sectors during the research period the pathway coal to industry displays dominant effects on the evolution of beijing s energy metabolic system keywords urban energy metabolic system evolution ecological network analysis haken model 1 introduction nowadays most of the world s energy production and consumption are not performed in a sustainable way to minimize the environmental impacts while seeking economic development and relieve the contradictions between energy supply and demand countries have been focusing on plans seeking a high efficient and environmentally friendly energy system as the world s largest development country china has experienced rapid industrialization and urbanization accompany with the fast development china s total energy consumption has ranked 1st among the world reaching 3123 mtoe in 2016 a high portion of energy is consumed in urban area resulted in excessive energy consumption and severe air pollutions in major chinese cities china is in urgent need to optimize the urban energy system he et al 2017 he and qiu 2016 in china s 13th five year plan upgrading the urban energy structure and building a modern energy storage transportation network are proposed to construct an efficient urban energy system liu et al 2018 wu and he 2018 as one of the essential elements for urban development energy has attracted great research interests on its supply demand efficiency environment impacts and the balance between environment and development these researches provide valuable solutions on solving the problems about urban energy utilization including energy shortage energy waste or energy pollution but some scholars point that traditional analysis confine the research view on the external characteristics of the urban energy system making the system become a black box zhang et al 2014 this will lead to the ignorance of the microscopic fluctuations and structural dynamics within the system resulting in unexplainable phenomenon therefore more and more researchers advocate that urban energy system analysis should cover more than just the total energy consumption or economic output it also needs to identify the energy metabolic pattern and diagnose the health condition pulido barrera et al 2018 hao et al 2018 davoudi and sturzaker 2017 urban energy metabolism first proposed by wolman in 1965 consists of the exchange conversion use and disposal process of energy in urban areas it reflects the structure and the functionality of an urban energy system through describing the status of the energy metabolic processes based on the similarities between an urban system and a natural system inspired by this analogy scholars have developed a range of interpretations and extensions of urban metabolic terms and adopted numerous applications of urban metabolism a series of implementations in the u s wolman 1965 canada codoban and kennedy 2008 china huang et al 2015 lei et al 2018 and have proved the effectiveness of urban energy metabolism however as current researches mainly focused on the characteristics of overall urban metabolism the inherent structures and functions of the system still needs further development in the past decades as urbanization accelerating population increasing and industrialization expanding significant growth took place in energy consumption and waste emissions in urban areas which resulted high metabolic throughputs and severe energy wastes and pollutions as such researchers conducted various methods in modeling the urban energy metabolism system including life cycle analysis norman et al 2006 material flow analysis rosado et al 2014 emergy analysis liang and zhang 2012 and ecological network analysis zhang et al 2017 2011 to assess the sustainability of urban energy system alberti 1999 su et al 2010 these studies focused on the flows among the components that formulated the structure of the system and combined with input output approach as a very powerful tool to calculate the embodied flow through the system with the rapid development of complex system science in the past decades researchers realized that cities cannot be regarded simple accumulation of sectors the complicated interactions mechanism among sectors make the city into a super organism this means that any change in population industries and other facilities within cities can trigger a series of complicated reactions in system moreover the mechanism of these reactions are usually nonlinear due to the cross impacts through the complex structure of the metabolic network in urban areas resulting the emerge of new operating pattern dong et al 2018 some scholars dijst et al 2018 noticed this phenomena and introduced complex theory to explain it the synergy effects and other complex system features of the metabolic system were analyzed zheng et al 2018 to reflect the dynamic evolution and intrinsic stochastic behavior of the complicated urban energy system zheng et al 2018 to fully understand the principles behind scholars have developed many interdisciplinary and innovative researches on urban system analysis and highlighted that complex system theory may provide the solution on describing and revealing the nonlinear mechanism of urban energy system the combination of thermodynamic system theory with socioeconomic system theory was first raised in a meeting organized by santa fe institute 1987 to seek deep insights and new ways of economic problems since then complex system analysis has been focusing on the synergy self organization and 3e energy economy environment effects of urban energy system in the research of urban metabolic system a very important task is to determine the key factors that dominate the energy metabolic pathways and processes to identify these key factors researchers have conducted a variety of analysis from different perspectives céspedes restrepo and morales pinzón 2018 rosales carreón and worrell 2018 using the network analysis different levels from sectors to cities of urban metabolism fath and killian 2007 zhang et al 2010 2011 were analyzed to figure out the structure and function of urban energy system which assist the optimization of urban energy system but there do exist improvements in this method because most of the current associated ecological network analysis were carried in a static perspective thus to reach more accurate and detailed insights on the interactions within the system a more systematic and dynamic approach is required this paper tries to identify the factors that dominate the urban energy metabolic processes especially from the time scale based on the explanation of system theory the urban metabolic system is more that the agglomeration of energy metabolic processes the interactions and the effects between these processes should also be considered which is known as the synergy effects thus the key problem lies in the synergistic effect among the urban energy metabolic processes according to haken s synergy theory wang and zhang 2014 the synergistic effects are the results of nonlinear interaction mechanism within the system researchers have conducted a series applications of haken model in investigating the socioeconomic system ye et al 2016 yan et al 2014 based on haken s explanation by identifying the dominant element or order parameter this mechanism can be described based on haken s theory researchers have conducted a range of complex system analysis using haken model guo et al 2005 wu et al 2009 in this paper we developed a model that integrate haken model in the urban energy metabolism analysis and analyzed beijing s energy statistics in 2010 2015 to accomplish this integration key energy producers and consumers of beijing s energy system are identified by defining the pathway and structure of beijing s energy system the metabolic processes within the system are described and various energy flows to different sectors are illustrated then these flows are converted into unified basis using emergy analysis method based on leontief method we accounted for the backflows and hidden flows within the system to calculate their cumulative effects of urban metabolic process at last the discretized haken model is embodied into the beijing s metabolic system to find out the order parameter that dominates the evolutionary process of beijing s energy system 2 defining the framework of urban energy metabolic system 2 1 components of urban energy metabolic system metabolic components are basic independent units of the urban energy system in the course of urban energy metabolism these components are divided into four sectors according to their features 1 the exploit sector 2 the conversion sector 3 the enterprise sector 4 the household sector every of these sectors consists of many subsectors that share the same function location on the metabolic process subsectors are independent with each other under the same sector but can be connected with those under different sector similarly each subsector can be divided into sub subsectors using this method the urban energy system can be decomposed into elements that have the basic input and output of energy flow the advantages of hierarchical structure are because there is no intersector between flows under an identical sector the total inflow and outflow of energy of a certain sector can be represented as below i s i 1 n f i j s i 1 n f i where i s is the input of sector s and j s is the output of sector s f i is the energy inflow or outflow of subsector i under sector s n is the number of subsectors under sector s 2 2 structure of urban energy metabolism the structure of urban energy metabolism can be described with network graph in fig 1 in this graph a node represents a sector and an arrow denotes a directed energy flow a sequence of nodes and arrows constitutes an energy metabolic pathway a pathway emerges where two nodes share an relationship of supply demand or other transaction of energy because the network is a directed graph there may exist many pathways or no pathway between two nodes which means nodes among the network may have 0 1 or many connections with each other the e f i j denotes the direction of energy flow between two sectors that is from sector i to sector j based on fig 2 the energy flow within the system can be calculated as below t i s i s m 1 n e f m s t o s j s n 1 n e f s n where t i s is the total inflow of sector s and t o s is the total outflow of sector s e f m s is the energy inflow from sector m to sector s and e f s n is the energy outflow from sector s to sector n the t i s and t o s can be taken as equal when the energy system is steady thus t o s t i s t s thus we can build the energy flow matrix of the system e f m n and the total inflow outflow matrix d i a g t d i a g t 1 t 2 t n 2 3 analysis of metabolic process after analyzing the component and structure of urban energy metabolism system we need to quantify the processes and flows within the system there are two things should be concerned 1 various energy flows are observed in the system a common standard should be introduced to unify these flows 2 backflows and cycles are found in the metabolic network so its cumulative effects should be considered but this information is not recorded in statistics and monitoring data the first problem can be solved using the emergy method by formulating a unified measurement the e f m n is converted into a dimensionless matrix where g m n e f m n t n based on this matrix the directed network become computable to analyze the functions of the urban energy metabolic system as for the second problem in the present paper we chose the leontief method to study the cumulative effects in the system while most of the pathways within the network we derived are single directional there exist bidirectional procedures and circles these flows are not recorded in statistics but have impacts on the whole system s energy metabolism during the metabolic processes the unrecorded flows cycle back to the system and do not produce direct and visible outputs these indirect flows among compartments can transfer along the circles or loops in the network and accumulate with the metabolism progress in common network analysis indirect interactions in matrix g are ascertained using higher order powers of and the overall cumulative interactions of the system can be computed using the leontief inverse from matrix g g m n a dimensionless integral flow matrix n can be computed n n i j g 0 g 1 g 2 g m i g 1 where the matrix n reflects the cumulative effects of the pathway among the four sectors in the whole energy metabolic system the identify matrix i reflects the self feedback of flows through each sector the matrix g reflects the direct relationships or pathway between any of the four sectors m represents the maximum number of steps in the system s pathways and g m indicates the indirect interactions or hidden pathways of energy flows between sectors 3 recognition of incentives in urban energy metabolism in the integral flow matrix the cumulative effects are determined to demonstrate the metabolic process of the urban energy system but it cannot describe the system s evolution trend not to mention reflect the incentives of the trend to fix this issue we extend the matrix s time variable from specific point to certain period using a time series of matrix to describe the evolutionary state of the urban energy metabolic system n n 1 n 2 n 3 n k n k denotes the n matrix in the k year then we established an algorithm to filter out the factors that have stable influence on the energy metabolic process d i j k i 1 m d i j k 1 d k d i j k n k 1 n k k 1 t d k d i j k is the matrix of embodied energy flow change where d i j k represents the change of embodied energy flow from node i to node j in year k factors that do not meet the conditions above are removed from the analysis to recognize the incentives that dominate the process of urban energy metabolism evolution we need to distinguish the factors of the system according to haken s synergy theory elements within a system can be distinguished into fast and slow parameters when the system is far from equilibrium or in an instable state the slow parameters dominate the process of the system s evolution allocate the fast parameters and become the order parameter of the system by calculating the instability point the slow parameter can be determined the haken model was developed based on the synergistic interaction between factors q 1 λ 1 q 1 a q 1 q 2 q 2 λ 2 q 2 b q 1 2 where q 1 and q 2 are the state variables a b λ 1 λ 2 are the control variables λ 1 a n d λ 2 denote the damping coefficient a a n d b represent the intensity of interaction between q 1 and q 2 a represents q 2 s synergistic impacts on q 1 if a is negative q 2 enhances q 1 and the effects increase with a if a is positive q 2 inhibits q 1 and the effects increase with a b represents q 1 s synergistic impacts on q 2 if b is positive q 1 enhances q 2 and the effects increase with b if b is negative q 1 inhibits q 2 and the effects increase with b λ 1 reflects the degree of q 1 s dominance on the whole system when λ 1 is negative q 1 has positive feedbacks on the system s evolution and the orderliness of the evolution increases with λ 1 when λ 1 is positive q 1 has negative feedbacks on the system s evolution and the disorderliness of the evolution increases with λ 1 λ 2 reflects the degree of q 2 s dominance on the whole system when λ 2 is negative q 2 has positive feedbacks on the system s evolution and the orderliness of the evolution increases with λ 2 when λ 2 is positive q 2 has negative feedbacks on the system s evolution and the disorderliness of the evolution increases with λ 2 using the adiabatic elimination method the calculation of the haken model can be simplified as below first we assume that q 2 is the fast parameter and get q 2 b λ 2 q 1 2 then we can have the equation q 1 λ 1 q 1 a b λ 2 q 1 3 based on these two equations within which we can discuss the parameters and distinguish the fast and slow parameters and find out the impacts of q 1 and q 2 on the system 4 case study analysis of beijing s energy metabolism 4 1 metabolic process in beijing s energy system beijing has been promoting the clean energy development strategy with the implement of motor vehicle restriction and coal free in power generation the energy metabolism in beijing has experienced significant changes to illustrate the status of beijing s energy metabolism in recent years the urban energy metabolism model is applied to support the empirical analysis in beijing in yearbook of beijing energy statistics 2011 2016 the energy data has been unified which allows us to calculate and compare directly we used the data of energy use in beijing from 2010 to 2015 and built the energy metabolic network in this network the flows within beijing s energy system are marked out where s1 represents coal s2 represents oil s3 represents natural gas s4 represents heat s5 represents electricity s6 represents agriculture s7 represents industry s8 represents service s9 represents household meanwhile we made a classification of these compartments into primary energy s1 s2 s3 secondary energy s4 s5 terminal consumptions s6 s7 s8 s9 fig 3 displays the energy transferred between sectors of beijing s energy system in 2010 and 2015 an obvious difference can be observed in the outflows from s1 and s3 which indicate that the energy metabolic processes are experiencing structural changes the consumptions of coal in secondary energy sectors and terminal consumptions sectors are both declining while that of natural gas in these sectors are increasing thus during this period of time the consumption pathway from s1 and s3 might be relatively connected with the clean energy development strategy in recent years although the figures have indicated the effectiveness of the policies but the actual impacts these policies have made are not the way the figures have illustrated fig 5 shows the direct indirect consumption ratio of energy in beijing during the full metabolic process fig 4 shows that among five main energy types in beijing coal and natural gas have high portions of indirect energy consumptions while others barely have any this indicates that besides the direct consumptions attentions on indirect consumptions of coal and natural gas are also needed these indirect consumption ratio ranges from 10 60 but we can see coal holds a relatively stable state compared with that of natural gas 4 2 recognition of slow parameter in beijing s metabolic evolution based on the calculations of the direct and indirect energy flows within the system we find out the factor sequence that has influence on the whole energy system d 1 d 17 d 27 d 37 d 48 d 58 d 2 d 17 d 37 d 57 d 28 d 29 d 39 d 49 d 57 d 3 d 15 d 16 d 17 d 19 d 4 d 14 d 16 d 17 d 24 d 26 d 27 d 37 d 38 d 5 d 14 d 16 d 19 d 29 the filtering algorithm was implemented to find out the factors that have stable influence on the energy metabolic process d i j k i 1 m d i j k 1 d k d i j k n k 1 n k k 1 t adopting a filter rule of 60 most of the factors are removed then we get d 16 d 17 d 37 the concise impact factor sequence indicates that the key flows within beijing s energy metabolic system are n 16 n 17 n 37 these flows represent the pathways from coal to agriculture coal to industry and natural gas to industry these three pathways are considered that may have dominant influence on the evolution of beijing s energy metabolism to distinguish the fast and slow parameters among these three flows the haken model was introduced because the time series of these flows are not continuous which is not applicable for the differential equations of haken model we improved the haken model to make it computable q 1 k 1 1 λ 1 q 1 k a q 1 k q 2 k q 2 k 1 1 λ 2 q 2 k b q 1 2 k then by assuming different flow as the slow parameter the model was fitted in the analysis that coal to agriculture n 16 as the fast parameters the fitting result of haken model is n 17 2 009 n 17 37 44 n 17 n 16 s s e 0 0853 r 2 0 8434 a d j u s t e d r 2 0 7245 n 16 1 0579 n 16 0 0024 n 17 2 s s e 0 0000 r 2 0 801 a d j u s t e d r 2 0 7986 while in the analysis that natural gas to industry n 37 as the fast parameters the fitting result of haken model is n 17 3 499 n 17 3 74 n 17 n 37 s s e 0 0717 r 2 0 8448 a d j u s t e d r 2 0 764 n 37 1 0827 n 37 0 0416 n 17 2 s s e 0 0028 r 2 0 8527 a d j u s t e d r 2 0 7703 from the analysis the results are acceptable in the case of coal to agriculture n 16 and coal to industry n 17 we calculated that a 37 44 b 0 0024 λ 1 3 009 λ 2 0 0579 according to the haken model s explanations a 0 a n d b 0 indicate that n 16 has positive impacts on n 17 while n 17 have negative impacts on n 16 a b means that n 16 have a much powerful promotion to n 17 meanwhile because λ 1 0 λ 2 0 and λ 1 λ 2 n 17 has negative effects on the evolution of beijing s energy metabolic system while n 16 has positive effects on the evolution of beijing s energy metabolic system and n 17 have a much stronger dominant effect in the case of coal to industry n 17 and natural gas to industry n 37 we got a 3 74 b 0 04 λ 1 2 499 λ 2 0 0028 a 0 a n d b 0 indicate that n 17 and n 37 have mutual inhibit effects with each other a b shows that n 17 has more stronger impacts on n 37 on the other hand because λ 1 0 λ 2 0 and λ 1 λ 2 n 17 and n 37 both have positive effects on the evolution of beijing s energy metabolic system and n 17 have a much stronger dominant effect these results both suggest the n 17 that coal to industry is the slow parameter to distinguish the impacts of rest two flows the synergistic effects between n 16 and n 37 were also calculated assuming n 16 is the fast parameter the fitting result of haken model between n 16 and n 37 is n 37 3 07 n 17 27 17 n 17 n 16 s s e 0 0017 r 2 0 7685 a d j u s t e d r 2 0 7558 n 16 1 038 n 16 0 0034 n 37 2 s s e 0 0008 r 2 0 8103 a d j u s t e d r 2 0 7471 the results suggest that a 2 07 b 0 0034 λ 1 2 07 λ 2 0 038 a 0 a n d b 0 indicate that n 16 has positive impacts on n 37 while n 37 have negative impacts on n 16 a b shows that n 37 has more stronger impacts than n 16 on the other hand because λ 1 0 λ 2 0 and λ 1 λ 2 n 16 and n 37 both have positive effects on the evolution of beijing s energy metabolic system and n 37 have a much stronger dominant effect according to the calculations above the comparison of synergistic impacts among n 16 n 17 n 37 on the evolution of beijing s energy metabolic system are revealed that is n 17 n 37 n 16 this indicates that the pathway coal to industry n 17 is the dominant factor that affecting the evolution in beijing s energy metabolism during 2010 2015 4 3 dominant factor analysis of beijing s energy metabolism we calculated the parameters of haken model in beijing s energy metabolic system and determined that the pathway coal to industry n 17 is the dominant factor that affecting the evolution in beijing s recent metabolism based on the results the change of intensity of coal in beijing s energy system especially on industry has a positive effect on beijing s energy structure improvement this helps to explain the effectiveness of the promotion of eliminating coal in beijing s energy system we noticed that although the direct consumption of coal during 2010 2015 have shown significant decline but the direct indirect and total consumption ratio against the total energy flows within the system have merely experienced changes meanwhile the direct indirect and total consumption ratio of natural gas have shown great increase this is consistent with the calculation of n 17 against n 37 that a 0 b 0 indicating the alternative effects between coal and natural gas in beijing s energy structure but we only found the increase in impacts of natural gas but lost the decrease in that of coal to understand how this mechanism works it is necessary to find out the impacts of coal flows have on the sectors the fig 5 shows the direct and indirect consumption ratio of coal on different sectors in beijing during 2010 2015 we found that the impacts of coal among sectors have displayed a very different trend during the research period under a macro scale statistics have revealed the decline of total coal consumption in beijing but when it comes to the sector scale the impacts of direct coal consumption suggest that the decline is only found in electricity s5 and industry s7 sector an intuitive reason of these decline is the policy of coal free in power generation and relocation of heavy pollution enterprises we also noticed that the indirect consumption ratio is declining in the four energy consuming sectors that is because the flow of embodied coal in the network is connected with the direct input of coal in the haken analysis between n 16 and n 17 we have noticed that although these two flows have a mutual enhancement between each other n 17 shows a dominant effect on the whole system s evolution which explains the significant disparity between these two flows in fig 6 but when we come to n 17 and n 37 we discovered that this might be question of the energy substitution in the process of coal eliminate from beijing s energy system natural gas is considered the alternative energy of coal therefore natural gas takes most of the vacancy coal has left this is consistent with the haken model that coal and natural gas has an opposite effect with each other fig 6 what should be aware of is that the λ 1 λ 2 calculated in n 17 and n 37 is found to be negative which means the substitution of coal and natural gas in beijing s energy system have an positive effect on the evolution of metabolism 5 conclusions in this paper we constructed a model based on ecological network analysis and haken model to study the mechanism of urban energy metabolic system from the time scale and recognize the key factors that dominate the evolution of the system s metabolism first we made an analogy analysis between urban energy metabolic system and natural metabolic system and built the conceptual framework of urban energy metabolic system based on the ecological system to measure the hidden embodied energy flows during the metabolic processes we calculated the cumulative effects of the direct and indirect energy metabolic flows then to identify the dominant factors that affect the evolution of urban energy metabolic system the haken model was applied into the analysis because of the complicated mechanism of the system at last an empirical study on beijing s energy system was conducted the results revealed that although the total direct consumption of coal in beijing has shown an apparent decline the total indirect consumption of coal has maintained a relatively stable intensity during 2010 2015 meanwhile the natural gas has experienced a significant growth both in direct and indirect consumptions which we believe have connections with the policies the government have been promoting in recent years these discoveries provided important insights of the optimization of beijing s energy structure besides the calculations that the haken model gained also indicate that during 2010 2015 the metabolic flow coal to industry played dominant role in the evolution of beijing s energy metabolic system considering the current status of beijing energy system we emphasized the dynamic features of urban energy metabolism thus we modified the ecological network analysis method and considered the synergy effects between energy metabolic process from the time scale and formulated a quantify method to account for it based on the results provided by this research we concluded there are dominant factors that have long term effect on the evolution of urban energy metabolic system which verifies the feasibility of this approach and provides recommendations for urban energy system optimization in this study we only considered metabolic process of main traditional energy in beijing renewable energies like biomass wind should be examined in further studies another issue is the time span and research scale should be expanded to improve the accuracy of the analysis because the data used in this paper might be insufficient to describe the complexity of the energy metabolic system acknowledgements this paper is funded by the national natural science

25209,ecological network analysis is an important tool for urban energy metabolism research but it does not consider the dynamic and synergy features of the system which constraints its application in urban transition studies in this paper we modified the ecological network analysis method to identify the key factors that dominate the evolution of the urban energy metabolism focusing on the dynamic and synergy characteristics of the system we observed the changes of direct and indirect energy consumption flows and combined with haken model to determine the dominant factors of the metabolic processes a case study on beijing was conducted to diagnose the key flows that impact the evolution of beijing s energy metabolic system during 2010 2015 results suggest that despite the decline in beijing s coal consumptions the direct and indirect parts have different tendency among sectors during the research period the pathway coal to industry displays dominant effects on the evolution of beijing s energy metabolic system keywords urban energy metabolic system evolution ecological network analysis haken model 1 introduction nowadays most of the world s energy production and consumption are not performed in a sustainable way to minimize the environmental impacts while seeking economic development and relieve the contradictions between energy supply and demand countries have been focusing on plans seeking a high efficient and environmentally friendly energy system as the world s largest development country china has experienced rapid industrialization and urbanization accompany with the fast development china s total energy consumption has ranked 1st among the world reaching 3123 mtoe in 2016 a high portion of energy is consumed in urban area resulted in excessive energy consumption and severe air pollutions in major chinese cities china is in urgent need to optimize the urban energy system he et al 2017 he and qiu 2016 in china s 13th five year plan upgrading the urban energy structure and building a modern energy storage transportation network are proposed to construct an efficient urban energy system liu et al 2018 wu and he 2018 as one of the essential elements for urban development energy has attracted great research interests on its supply demand efficiency environment impacts and the balance between environment and development these researches provide valuable solutions on solving the problems about urban energy utilization including energy shortage energy waste or energy pollution but some scholars point that traditional analysis confine the research view on the external characteristics of the urban energy system making the system become a black box zhang et al 2014 this will lead to the ignorance of the microscopic fluctuations and structural dynamics within the system resulting in unexplainable phenomenon therefore more and more researchers advocate that urban energy system analysis should cover more than just the total energy consumption or economic output it also needs to identify the energy metabolic pattern and diagnose the health condition pulido barrera et al 2018 hao et al 2018 davoudi and sturzaker 2017 urban energy metabolism first proposed by wolman in 1965 consists of the exchange conversion use and disposal process of energy in urban areas it reflects the structure and the functionality of an urban energy system through describing the status of the energy metabolic processes based on the similarities between an urban system and a natural system inspired by this analogy scholars have developed a range of interpretations and extensions of urban metabolic terms and adopted numerous applications of urban metabolism a series of implementations in the u s wolman 1965 canada codoban and kennedy 2008 china huang et al 2015 lei et al 2018 and have proved the effectiveness of urban energy metabolism however as current researches mainly focused on the characteristics of overall urban metabolism the inherent structures and functions of the system still needs further development in the past decades as urbanization accelerating population increasing and industrialization expanding significant growth took place in energy consumption and waste emissions in urban areas which resulted high metabolic throughputs and severe energy wastes and pollutions as such researchers conducted various methods in modeling the urban energy metabolism system including life cycle analysis norman et al 2006 material flow analysis rosado et al 2014 emergy analysis liang and zhang 2012 and ecological network analysis zhang et al 2017 2011 to assess the sustainability of urban energy system alberti 1999 su et al 2010 these studies focused on the flows among the components that formulated the structure of the system and combined with input output approach as a very powerful tool to calculate the embodied flow through the system with the rapid development of complex system science in the past decades researchers realized that cities cannot be regarded simple accumulation of sectors the complicated interactions mechanism among sectors make the city into a super organism this means that any change in population industries and other facilities within cities can trigger a series of complicated reactions in system moreover the mechanism of these reactions are usually nonlinear due to the cross impacts through the complex structure of the metabolic network in urban areas resulting the emerge of new operating pattern dong et al 2018 some scholars dijst et al 2018 noticed this phenomena and introduced complex theory to explain it the synergy effects and other complex system features of the metabolic system were analyzed zheng et al 2018 to reflect the dynamic evolution and intrinsic stochastic behavior of the complicated urban energy system zheng et al 2018 to fully understand the principles behind scholars have developed many interdisciplinary and innovative researches on urban system analysis and highlighted that complex system theory may provide the solution on describing and revealing the nonlinear mechanism of urban energy system the combination of thermodynamic system theory with socioeconomic system theory was first raised in a meeting organized by santa fe institute 1987 to seek deep insights and new ways of economic problems since then complex system analysis has been focusing on the synergy self organization and 3e energy economy environment effects of urban energy system in the research of urban metabolic system a very important task is to determine the key factors that dominate the energy metabolic pathways and processes to identify these key factors researchers have conducted a variety of analysis from different perspectives céspedes restrepo and morales pinzón 2018 rosales carreón and worrell 2018 using the network analysis different levels from sectors to cities of urban metabolism fath and killian 2007 zhang et al 2010 2011 were analyzed to figure out the structure and function of urban energy system which assist the optimization of urban energy system but there do exist improvements in this method because most of the current associated ecological network analysis were carried in a static perspective thus to reach more accurate and detailed insights on the interactions within the system a more systematic and dynamic approach is required this paper tries to identify the factors that dominate the urban energy metabolic processes especially from the time scale based on the explanation of system theory the urban metabolic system is more that the agglomeration of energy metabolic processes the interactions and the effects between these processes should also be considered which is known as the synergy effects thus the key problem lies in the synergistic effect among the urban energy metabolic processes according to haken s synergy theory wang and zhang 2014 the synergistic effects are the results of nonlinear interaction mechanism within the system researchers have conducted a series applications of haken model in investigating the socioeconomic system ye et al 2016 yan et al 2014 based on haken s explanation by identifying the dominant element or order parameter this mechanism can be described based on haken s theory researchers have conducted a range of complex system analysis using haken model guo et al 2005 wu et al 2009 in this paper we developed a model that integrate haken model in the urban energy metabolism analysis and analyzed beijing s energy statistics in 2010 2015 to accomplish this integration key energy producers and consumers of beijing s energy system are identified by defining the pathway and structure of beijing s energy system the metabolic processes within the system are described and various energy flows to different sectors are illustrated then these flows are converted into unified basis using emergy analysis method based on leontief method we accounted for the backflows and hidden flows within the system to calculate their cumulative effects of urban metabolic process at last the discretized haken model is embodied into the beijing s metabolic system to find out the order parameter that dominates the evolutionary process of beijing s energy system 2 defining the framework of urban energy metabolic system 2 1 components of urban energy metabolic system metabolic components are basic independent units of the urban energy system in the course of urban energy metabolism these components are divided into four sectors according to their features 1 the exploit sector 2 the conversion sector 3 the enterprise sector 4 the household sector every of these sectors consists of many subsectors that share the same function location on the metabolic process subsectors are independent with each other under the same sector but can be connected with those under different sector similarly each subsector can be divided into sub subsectors using this method the urban energy system can be decomposed into elements that have the basic input and output of energy flow the advantages of hierarchical structure are because there is no intersector between flows under an identical sector the total inflow and outflow of energy of a certain sector can be represented as below i s i 1 n f i j s i 1 n f i where i s is the input of sector s and j s is the output of sector s f i is the energy inflow or outflow of subsector i under sector s n is the number of subsectors under sector s 2 2 structure of urban energy metabolism the structure of urban energy metabolism can be described with network graph in fig 1 in this graph a node represents a sector and an arrow denotes a directed energy flow a sequence of nodes and arrows constitutes an energy metabolic pathway a pathway emerges where two nodes share an relationship of supply demand or other transaction of energy because the network is a directed graph there may exist many pathways or no pathway between two nodes which means nodes among the network may have 0 1 or many connections with each other the e f i j denotes the direction of energy flow between two sectors that is from sector i to sector j based on fig 2 the energy flow within the system can be calculated as below t i s i s m 1 n e f m s t o s j s n 1 n e f s n where t i s is the total inflow of sector s and t o s is the total outflow of sector s e f m s is the energy inflow from sector m to sector s and e f s n is the energy outflow from sector s to sector n the t i s and t o s can be taken as equal when the energy system is steady thus t o s t i s t s thus we can build the energy flow matrix of the system e f m n and the total inflow outflow matrix d i a g t d i a g t 1 t 2 t n 2 3 analysis of metabolic process after analyzing the component and structure of urban energy metabolism system we need to quantify the processes and flows within the system there are two things should be concerned 1 various energy flows are observed in the system a common standard should be introduced to unify these flows 2 backflows and cycles are found in the metabolic network so its cumulative effects should be considered but this information is not recorded in statistics and monitoring data the first problem can be solved using the emergy method by formulating a unified measurement the e f m n is converted into a dimensionless matrix where g m n e f m n t n based on this matrix the directed network become computable to analyze the functions of the urban energy metabolic system as for the second problem in the present paper we chose the leontief method to study the cumulative effects in the system while most of the pathways within the network we derived are single directional there exist bidirectional procedures and circles these flows are not recorded in statistics but have impacts on the whole system s energy metabolism during the metabolic processes the unrecorded flows cycle back to the system and do not produce direct and visible outputs these indirect flows among compartments can transfer along the circles or loops in the network and accumulate with the metabolism progress in common network analysis indirect interactions in matrix g are ascertained using higher order powers of and the overall cumulative interactions of the system can be computed using the leontief inverse from matrix g g m n a dimensionless integral flow matrix n can be computed n n i j g 0 g 1 g 2 g m i g 1 where the matrix n reflects the cumulative effects of the pathway among the four sectors in the whole energy metabolic system the identify matrix i reflects the self feedback of flows through each sector the matrix g reflects the direct relationships or pathway between any of the four sectors m represents the maximum number of steps in the system s pathways and g m indicates the indirect interactions or hidden pathways of energy flows between sectors 3 recognition of incentives in urban energy metabolism in the integral flow matrix the cumulative effects are determined to demonstrate the metabolic process of the urban energy system but it cannot describe the system s evolution trend not to mention reflect the incentives of the trend to fix this issue we extend the matrix s time variable from specific point to certain period using a time series of matrix to describe the evolutionary state of the urban energy metabolic system n n 1 n 2 n 3 n k n k denotes the n matrix in the k year then we established an algorithm to filter out the factors that have stable influence on the energy metabolic process d i j k i 1 m d i j k 1 d k d i j k n k 1 n k k 1 t d k d i j k is the matrix of embodied energy flow change where d i j k represents the change of embodied energy flow from node i to node j in year k factors that do not meet the conditions above are removed from the analysis to recognize the incentives that dominate the process of urban energy metabolism evolution we need to distinguish the factors of the system according to haken s synergy theory elements within a system can be distinguished into fast and slow parameters when the system is far from equilibrium or in an instable state the slow parameters dominate the process of the system s evolution allocate the fast parameters and become the order parameter of the system by calculating the instability point the slow parameter can be determined the haken model was developed based on the synergistic interaction between factors q 1 λ 1 q 1 a q 1 q 2 q 2 λ 2 q 2 b q 1 2 where q 1 and q 2 are the state variables a b λ 1 λ 2 are the control variables λ 1 a n d λ 2 denote the damping coefficient a a n d b represent the intensity of interaction between q 1 and q 2 a represents q 2 s synergistic impacts on q 1 if a is negative q 2 enhances q 1 and the effects increase with a if a is positive q 2 inhibits q 1 and the effects increase with a b represents q 1 s synergistic impacts on q 2 if b is positive q 1 enhances q 2 and the effects increase with b if b is negative q 1 inhibits q 2 and the effects increase with b λ 1 reflects the degree of q 1 s dominance on the whole system when λ 1 is negative q 1 has positive feedbacks on the system s evolution and the orderliness of the evolution increases with λ 1 when λ 1 is positive q 1 has negative feedbacks on the system s evolution and the disorderliness of the evolution increases with λ 1 λ 2 reflects the degree of q 2 s dominance on the whole system when λ 2 is negative q 2 has positive feedbacks on the system s evolution and the orderliness of the evolution increases with λ 2 when λ 2 is positive q 2 has negative feedbacks on the system s evolution and the disorderliness of the evolution increases with λ 2 using the adiabatic elimination method the calculation of the haken model can be simplified as below first we assume that q 2 is the fast parameter and get q 2 b λ 2 q 1 2 then we can have the equation q 1 λ 1 q 1 a b λ 2 q 1 3 based on these two equations within which we can discuss the parameters and distinguish the fast and slow parameters and find out the impacts of q 1 and q 2 on the system 4 case study analysis of beijing s energy metabolism 4 1 metabolic process in beijing s energy system beijing has been promoting the clean energy development strategy with the implement of motor vehicle restriction and coal free in power generation the energy metabolism in beijing has experienced significant changes to illustrate the status of beijing s energy metabolism in recent years the urban energy metabolism model is applied to support the empirical analysis in beijing in yearbook of beijing energy statistics 2011 2016 the energy data has been unified which allows us to calculate and compare directly we used the data of energy use in beijing from 2010 to 2015 and built the energy metabolic network in this network the flows within beijing s energy system are marked out where s1 represents coal s2 represents oil s3 represents natural gas s4 represents heat s5 represents electricity s6 represents agriculture s7 represents industry s8 represents service s9 represents household meanwhile we made a classification of these compartments into primary energy s1 s2 s3 secondary energy s4 s5 terminal consumptions s6 s7 s8 s9 fig 3 displays the energy transferred between sectors of beijing s energy system in 2010 and 2015 an obvious difference can be observed in the outflows from s1 and s3 which indicate that the energy metabolic processes are experiencing structural changes the consumptions of coal in secondary energy sectors and terminal consumptions sectors are both declining while that of natural gas in these sectors are increasing thus during this period of time the consumption pathway from s1 and s3 might be relatively connected with the clean energy development strategy in recent years although the figures have indicated the effectiveness of the policies but the actual impacts these policies have made are not the way the figures have illustrated fig 5 shows the direct indirect consumption ratio of energy in beijing during the full metabolic process fig 4 shows that among five main energy types in beijing coal and natural gas have high portions of indirect energy consumptions while others barely have any this indicates that besides the direct consumptions attentions on indirect consumptions of coal and natural gas are also needed these indirect consumption ratio ranges from 10 60 but we can see coal holds a relatively stable state compared with that of natural gas 4 2 recognition of slow parameter in beijing s metabolic evolution based on the calculations of the direct and indirect energy flows within the system we find out the factor sequence that has influence on the whole energy system d 1 d 17 d 27 d 37 d 48 d 58 d 2 d 17 d 37 d 57 d 28 d 29 d 39 d 49 d 57 d 3 d 15 d 16 d 17 d 19 d 4 d 14 d 16 d 17 d 24 d 26 d 27 d 37 d 38 d 5 d 14 d 16 d 19 d 29 the filtering algorithm was implemented to find out the factors that have stable influence on the energy metabolic process d i j k i 1 m d i j k 1 d k d i j k n k 1 n k k 1 t adopting a filter rule of 60 most of the factors are removed then we get d 16 d 17 d 37 the concise impact factor sequence indicates that the key flows within beijing s energy metabolic system are n 16 n 17 n 37 these flows represent the pathways from coal to agriculture coal to industry and natural gas to industry these three pathways are considered that may have dominant influence on the evolution of beijing s energy metabolism to distinguish the fast and slow parameters among these three flows the haken model was introduced because the time series of these flows are not continuous which is not applicable for the differential equations of haken model we improved the haken model to make it computable q 1 k 1 1 λ 1 q 1 k a q 1 k q 2 k q 2 k 1 1 λ 2 q 2 k b q 1 2 k then by assuming different flow as the slow parameter the model was fitted in the analysis that coal to agriculture n 16 as the fast parameters the fitting result of haken model is n 17 2 009 n 17 37 44 n 17 n 16 s s e 0 0853 r 2 0 8434 a d j u s t e d r 2 0 7245 n 16 1 0579 n 16 0 0024 n 17 2 s s e 0 0000 r 2 0 801 a d j u s t e d r 2 0 7986 while in the analysis that natural gas to industry n 37 as the fast parameters the fitting result of haken model is n 17 3 499 n 17 3 74 n 17 n 37 s s e 0 0717 r 2 0 8448 a d j u s t e d r 2 0 764 n 37 1 0827 n 37 0 0416 n 17 2 s s e 0 0028 r 2 0 8527 a d j u s t e d r 2 0 7703 from the analysis the results are acceptable in the case of coal to agriculture n 16 and coal to industry n 17 we calculated that a 37 44 b 0 0024 λ 1 3 009 λ 2 0 0579 according to the haken model s explanations a 0 a n d b 0 indicate that n 16 has positive impacts on n 17 while n 17 have negative impacts on n 16 a b means that n 16 have a much powerful promotion to n 17 meanwhile because λ 1 0 λ 2 0 and λ 1 λ 2 n 17 has negative effects on the evolution of beijing s energy metabolic system while n 16 has positive effects on the evolution of beijing s energy metabolic system and n 17 have a much stronger dominant effect in the case of coal to industry n 17 and natural gas to industry n 37 we got a 3 74 b 0 04 λ 1 2 499 λ 2 0 0028 a 0 a n d b 0 indicate that n 17 and n 37 have mutual inhibit effects with each other a b shows that n 17 has more stronger impacts on n 37 on the other hand because λ 1 0 λ 2 0 and λ 1 λ 2 n 17 and n 37 both have positive effects on the evolution of beijing s energy metabolic system and n 17 have a much stronger dominant effect these results both suggest the n 17 that coal to industry is the slow parameter to distinguish the impacts of rest two flows the synergistic effects between n 16 and n 37 were also calculated assuming n 16 is the fast parameter the fitting result of haken model between n 16 and n 37 is n 37 3 07 n 17 27 17 n 17 n 16 s s e 0 0017 r 2 0 7685 a d j u s t e d r 2 0 7558 n 16 1 038 n 16 0 0034 n 37 2 s s e 0 0008 r 2 0 8103 a d j u s t e d r 2 0 7471 the results suggest that a 2 07 b 0 0034 λ 1 2 07 λ 2 0 038 a 0 a n d b 0 indicate that n 16 has positive impacts on n 37 while n 37 have negative impacts on n 16 a b shows that n 37 has more stronger impacts than n 16 on the other hand because λ 1 0 λ 2 0 and λ 1 λ 2 n 16 and n 37 both have positive effects on the evolution of beijing s energy metabolic system and n 37 have a much stronger dominant effect according to the calculations above the comparison of synergistic impacts among n 16 n 17 n 37 on the evolution of beijing s energy metabolic system are revealed that is n 17 n 37 n 16 this indicates that the pathway coal to industry n 17 is the dominant factor that affecting the evolution in beijing s energy metabolism during 2010 2015 4 3 dominant factor analysis of beijing s energy metabolism we calculated the parameters of haken model in beijing s energy metabolic system and determined that the pathway coal to industry n 17 is the dominant factor that affecting the evolution in beijing s recent metabolism based on the results the change of intensity of coal in beijing s energy system especially on industry has a positive effect on beijing s energy structure improvement this helps to explain the effectiveness of the promotion of eliminating coal in beijing s energy system we noticed that although the direct consumption of coal during 2010 2015 have shown significant decline but the direct indirect and total consumption ratio against the total energy flows within the system have merely experienced changes meanwhile the direct indirect and total consumption ratio of natural gas have shown great increase this is consistent with the calculation of n 17 against n 37 that a 0 b 0 indicating the alternative effects between coal and natural gas in beijing s energy structure but we only found the increase in impacts of natural gas but lost the decrease in that of coal to understand how this mechanism works it is necessary to find out the impacts of coal flows have on the sectors the fig 5 shows the direct and indirect consumption ratio of coal on different sectors in beijing during 2010 2015 we found that the impacts of coal among sectors have displayed a very different trend during the research period under a macro scale statistics have revealed the decline of total coal consumption in beijing but when it comes to the sector scale the impacts of direct coal consumption suggest that the decline is only found in electricity s5 and industry s7 sector an intuitive reason of these decline is the policy of coal free in power generation and relocation of heavy pollution enterprises we also noticed that the indirect consumption ratio is declining in the four energy consuming sectors that is because the flow of embodied coal in the network is connected with the direct input of coal in the haken analysis between n 16 and n 17 we have noticed that although these two flows have a mutual enhancement between each other n 17 shows a dominant effect on the whole system s evolution which explains the significant disparity between these two flows in fig 6 but when we come to n 17 and n 37 we discovered that this might be question of the energy substitution in the process of coal eliminate from beijing s energy system natural gas is considered the alternative energy of coal therefore natural gas takes most of the vacancy coal has left this is consistent with the haken model that coal and natural gas has an opposite effect with each other fig 6 what should be aware of is that the λ 1 λ 2 calculated in n 17 and n 37 is found to be negative which means the substitution of coal and natural gas in beijing s energy system have an positive effect on the evolution of metabolism 5 conclusions in this paper we constructed a model based on ecological network analysis and haken model to study the mechanism of urban energy metabolic system from the time scale and recognize the key factors that dominate the evolution of the system s metabolism first we made an analogy analysis between urban energy metabolic system and natural metabolic system and built the conceptual framework of urban energy metabolic system based on the ecological system to measure the hidden embodied energy flows during the metabolic processes we calculated the cumulative effects of the direct and indirect energy metabolic flows then to identify the dominant factors that affect the evolution of urban energy metabolic system the haken model was applied into the analysis because of the complicated mechanism of the system at last an empirical study on beijing s energy system was conducted the results revealed that although the total direct consumption of coal in beijing has shown an apparent decline the total indirect consumption of coal has maintained a relatively stable intensity during 2010 2015 meanwhile the natural gas has experienced a significant growth both in direct and indirect consumptions which we believe have connections with the policies the government have been promoting in recent years these discoveries provided important insights of the optimization of beijing s energy structure besides the calculations that the haken model gained also indicate that during 2010 2015 the metabolic flow coal to industry played dominant role in the evolution of beijing s energy metabolic system considering the current status of beijing energy system we emphasized the dynamic features of urban energy metabolism thus we modified the ecological network analysis method and considered the synergy effects between energy metabolic process from the time scale and formulated a quantify method to account for it based on the results provided by this research we concluded there are dominant factors that have long term effect on the evolution of urban energy metabolic system which verifies the feasibility of this approach and provides recommendations for urban energy system optimization in this study we only considered metabolic process of main
