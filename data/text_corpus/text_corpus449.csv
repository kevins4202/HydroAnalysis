2245,accurate estimation of soil water content and water table depth is important for making irrigation measures and rational groundwater use in arid agricultural areas with shallow water table depth soil water balance models are widely used due to their high computational efficiency while they are less applicable in areas with shallow water table depths because they usually ignore the matric potential in addition the effect of capillary rise on soil water state is also ignored to address these problems a flow model for partly and fully saturated soil referred to as modified ubmod was developed in this study based on ubmod and the water table depth fluctuation analysis ubmod is a soil water balance model that differs from other water balance models by considering soil water movement driven by matric potential in the modified ubmod soil water flow and groundwater recharge rate are calculated using the original ubmod algorithm and water table depth is calculated using the water table depth fluctuation analysis the field capacity used in the modified ubmod was considered as a variable related to the water table depth to reflect the impact of capillary rise which helps to obtain accurate water flux across the saturated unsaturated interface two synthetic cases simulated with hydrus were used to test the sensitivities of the model parameters and specifications two real world cases were used to show the fidelity of the model to the observed data the results demonstrated that the model could solve the unsaturated saturated problems based on more readily available parameters without stringent requirements on spatial and time steps with a full guarantee of water balance and low computational cost this study provides an effective tool for hydrodynamic studies in areas with shallow water table depths keywords unsaturated saturated model water balance model soil water content water table depth field capacity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction agricultural irrigation consumes about 70 to 90 of the world s total water in arid and semi arid regions babajimopoulos et al 2007 cai et al 2003 dubois 2011 xue et al 2020 which leads to a serious imbalance between water supply and demand in areas where surface water resource is scarce groundwater is an important resource for crop growth food security and ecosystems ge et al 2017 gleeson et al 2016 sebai et al 2017 shallow groundwater occurs in many regions around the world such as the riparian zone of streams wetland areas and cropland using river water for irrigation babajimopoulos et al 2007 gowing et al 2006 jalili et al 2011 karimov et al 2014 wang et al 2018 fan et al 2013 concluded that 22 to 32 of the global land area is affected by shallow groundwater including 15 as groundwater fed surface water features and 7 to 17 with groundwater recharged plant root uptake luo et al 2008 naumburg et al 2005 soylu et al 2011 yeh and famiglietti 2009 shallow groundwater can recharge the root zone through phreatic evaporation thus alleviating crop water deficit in arid and semi arid agricultural areas therefore accurate estimation of soil water dynamics and water table depth is important for making irrigation measures and rational use of groundwater under shallow groundwater conditions dorigo et al 2011 fan et al 2007 robock et al 2000 verstraeten et al 2008 zhao et al 2020 many numerical models have been developed to describe the water flow for partly and fully saturated soils most models are developed based on richards equation such as hydrus šimůnek et al 2012 swap van dam et al 2008 feflow diersch 2014 su3d dogan and motz 2005 hydrogeosphere brunner and simmons 2012 and modhms tian et al 2015 which are considered as rigorous approaches to describe water flow for partly and fully saturated soils due to their robust theoretical foundation pikul et al 1974 yang et al 2016 however these models where saturated and non saturated flow processes are fully integrated require intensive input data and model parameters based on a large number of measurement experiments and consume high computational costs because the highly nonlinear equations must be solved by repetitive iterations zhu et al 2012 zha et al 2019 in addition these models may have poor numerical stability performance when irrigation is applied to dry soils repeatedly zha et al 2019 which is a common phenomenon in arid and semi arid agricultural areas these reasons limit the practical application of numerical models to real world problems shen and phanikumar 2010 szymkiewicz et al 2018 van walsum and groenendijk 2008 due to these difficulties a number of water balance models also known as conceptual models have been developed including watbal berghuijs van dijk 1985 saltmod mao et al 2017 oosterbaan 1998 infil 3 0 fill 2008 swat arnold et al 2012 and rzsbm sun et al 2019 these models are computationally efficient and can provide reasonable estimates of the quantities of interest based on simple input parameters which are more easily extended to practical problems however many water balance models were developed for areas with deep water table depth more than 20 m chen et al 2010 jiang et al 2008 kendy et al 2003 kendy et al 2004 wang et al 2019 yang et al 2015 which only consider the water flow driven by gravitational potential and ignore the matric potential arnold et al 2012 fill 2008 jiang et al 2008 the matric potential should be considered in areas with shallow water table depths because the gravitational potential and the matric potential are of the same order liu et al 2019 in addition another problem of some traditional water balance models is the oversimplified treatment of heterogeneous soils to enhance the applicability of the water balance models in the real world mao et al 2018 developed a soil water balance model marked as ubmod which considers both gravitational potential and matric potential and can reasonably describe soil water flow in heterogeneous soils however the ubmod model was developed based on the soil water content θ form richards equation mao et al 2018 which is not suitable for describing saturated flow because soil water content cannot reflect the hydraulic gradient in the saturated zone hills et al 1989 therefore the model cannot be used in areas with shallow water table depths and significant groundwater capillary rise although the soil water content θ form richards equation cannot be used in the saturated zone it can be used as an unsaturated module and coupled with the saturated module to simulate water flow for partly and fully saturated soils the water flux across the groundwater table is the key variable connecting the saturated and unsaturated zones and has been commonly used to calculate the water table depth anuraga et al 2006 chinnasamy et al 2018 singh 2011 xu et al 2010 yue et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 however when the water table depth is shallow the soil moisture above the water table becomes significantly larger due to the influence of rising capillary water in traditional water balance models as well as ubmod field capacity is used to describe the soil water content that can be maintained in a soil layer specifically under the effect of gravitational potential the soil water content remains stable when the soil water content is less than the field capacity while soil water can percolate to the next layer when the soil water content exceeds the field capacity gandolfi et al 2006 the field capacity is treated as a constant value for a given soil texture in these models which is suitable for unsaturated flow with deeper water table depths cassel and nielsen 1986 however under shallow water table depth conditions the soil cannot be adequately drained by gravity and the amount of water that can be held by the soil above the water table is significantly greater than the field capacity resulting in inaccurate estimations of water flux across the groundwater table therefore the fixed field capacity assumption adopted by traditional water balance models and ubmod fails under shallow water table depth conditions and the field capacity above the water table should be modified cassel and nielsen 1986 cavazza et al 2007 nachabe 1998 raes et al 2018 and xiong et al 2019 adopted a parabolic function to adjust the field capacity above the water table when considering the impact of shallow water table depth liu et al 2019 2020 used the simplified brooks and corey soil moisture characteristic curve brooks and corey 1964 to estimate the field capacity the appropriate and simple parameterized adjusted function of the field capacity for ubmod should be estimated to obtain the accurate water flux across the unsaturated saturated interface in this study a new flow model for estimating soil water content and water table depth in shallow water table depth areas referred to as modified ubmod was developed based on ubmod mao et al 2018 and water table depth fluctuation analysis the field capacity in the modified ubmod was assumed to vary with the water table depth due to capillary rise this obtains an accurate water flux across the saturated unsaturated interface two synthetic test cases were designed to evaluate the performance of the model and to access the impact of parameters then a published example with a heterogeneous soil profile was adopted to verify the modified ubmod furthermore the modified ubmod was applied to a real world case in the hetao irrigation district located in the arid region of northwestern china the details of the modified ubmod were given in section 2 then four cases to test the model accuracy and performance were listed in section 3 followed by the results and discussion described in section 4 the conclusion was presented in section 5 2 model development in this section the modified ubmod will be introduced in detail the modified ubmod integrates an unsaturated module and a saturated module the unsaturated module is based on the ubmod which has been described in detail by mao et al 2018 and will be described in section 2 1 to ensure that this paper is self contained the saturated module is based on the water table depth fluctuation analysis which will be introduced in section 2 2 the schematic of the major calculation procedures of the model is shown in fig 1 the field capacity is treated as a variable that varies with groundwater table depth which will be described in section 2 3 the upper and lower boundary conditions of the model can be set as either first type boundary conditions or second type boundary conditions 2 1 the unsaturated module the unsaturated module consists of four procedures as shown in the first four procedures in fig 1 firstly the allocation of the infiltration water is calculated the one dimensional 1 d vertical soil column is divided into n soil layers which include both the saturated zone and the unsaturated zone the unsaturated zone is assumed to have a total of b layers and the groundwater table is at the lower boundary of layer b the infiltration water fills the soil layers in the unsaturated zone from layer 1 to layer b to be saturated from top to bottom until all the infiltration water is consumed the residual water is considered to be a surface runoff and no excess infiltration water can cross the saturated unsaturated interface in this procedure the amount of the allocated water for layer i is 1 q i min m i θ s i θ i i i d i 1 where i i 1 b is the vertical soil layer qi is the amount of allocated water per unit area of layer i l mi is the thickness of layer i l θs i is the saturated soil water content of layer i l3l 3 θi is the initial soil water content of layer i l3l 3 i is the amount of infiltration water per unit area l id i 1 is the consumed infiltration water per unit area of all upper layers above layer i l secondly the soil water will move downward driven by the gravitational potential when the soil water content of a layer exceeds the field capacity the governing equation is 2 θ t k θ z where θ is the soil water content l3l 3 t is the time t z is the soil depth below the soil surface l k θ is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity lt 1 six commonly used empirical functions for calculating k θ also known as drainage functions embedded in ubmod are listed in table 1 the soil water flux into the saturated zone caused by the gravitational potential is denoted as dq as shown in fig 1 then the soil water movement driven by the sink term is calculated the governing equation is 3 θ t w where w is the sink term t 1 including soil evaporation and the root uptake term due to crop transpiration the penman monteith equation is used to calculate the potential evapotranspiration eto first then the ritchie type equation is used to estimate the potential soil evaporation ep and potential crop transpiration tp based on crop coefficient kc and leaf area index lai in addition the evaporation cumulative distribution function and the root density function are used the assign ep and tp to each soil layers the daily crop coefficient kc leaf area index lai and root depth rd are calculated based on a crop growth module the actual soil evaporation ea and crop transpiration ta are obtained by discounting ep and tp with the soil water stress coefficient the actual soil evaporation ea and crop transpiration ta will be reduced directly from the soil water content of the corresponding soil layers when the critical depth of evapotranspiration is shallower than the water table depth groundwater can also be consumed by soil evaporation or crop transpiration and the term caused by evapotranspiration from the saturated zone to the unsaturated zone is uq as shown in fig 1 lastly the soil water diffusive movement driven by the matric potential is calculated the computational region of this step is the whole unsaturated zone layer 1 to layer b and the top layer of the saturated zone b 1 layer the governing equation is 4 θ t z d θ θ z l 1 l θ p l p l z where d θ is the hydraulic diffusivity l2t 1 pl l 1 l are the parameters of the soil water retention function and l is the number of parameters the term l 1 l θ p l p l z is the modification term describing the effect of soil heterogeneity there is an upward flux across the saturated unsaturated interface caused by the soil water diffusive movement driven by the matric potential denoted as df the details for solving eq 4 can be found in the appendix the hydraulic diffusivity is calculated by an empirical formula 5 d θ 10 a s b where s is the effective saturation a and b are two intermediate parameters relationships between these two parameters and the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks are established as 6 a 2 87 log 10 k s 2 2 50 log 10 k s 4 23 b 2 42 log 10 k s 2 0 49 log 10 k s 3 58 the units of d θ in eq 5 and ks in eq 6 are m2 d and m d respectively by following eq 5 and eq 6 the hydraulic diffusivity is calculated using three physically significant parameters saturated hydraulic conductivity ks saturated water content θ s and residual water content θr and the soil water content θ ubmod is not a strictly numerical solution model and the stepwise calculations may introduce computational errors into ubmod however in our previous study the results indicate that the error is small mao et al 2008 we sacrifice some computational accuracy in exchange for some other characteristics such as good computational stability and efficiency lower requirements on parameters and coarser restrictions on spatio temporal steps the hydraulic diffusivity of the saturated zone is numerically infinite based on soil water characteristic curves such as the van genuchten model the finite value calculated by eq 5 is used to describe the hydraulic diffusivity in the saturation case where the diffusive movement driven by the matric potential across the saturated unsaturated interface is calculated based on the assumed hydraulic diffusivity the impact of the assumed hydraulic diffusivity is discussed in section 4 1 2 2 the saturated module the unsaturated module describes the soil water movement and can obtain the net water flux across the saturated unsaturated interface the water table depth is calculated by the water table depth fluctuation analysis in the saturated module the equations are as follows 7 wt d j 1 w t d j fq μ 8 fq d q u q d f where wtdj 1 l and wtdj l are the water table depths at the time steps of j 1 and j respectively μ is the specific yield fq is the net water flux across the saturated unsaturated interface per unit area l dq l uq l and df l are the water fluxes across the saturated unsaturated interface per unit area caused by water movement driven by the gravitational potential sink terms by external forces and water movement driven by the matric potential respectively although studies have shown that specific yield is related to soil type water table depth and water dynamics in the unsaturated zone and equations have been proposed for some cases nachabe 2002 shah and ross 2009 gumuła kawęcka et al 2022 it is still difficult to find a general expression that can describe the specific yield for various complex cases in addition a varying specific yield can greatly reduce the computational stability of the model therefore the specific yield is currently an independent and constant input variable when the current water table depth is updated the soil water content between wtdj and wtdj 1 should be updated as 9 θ j 1 θ s f q 0 θ j f q 0 θ s μ f q 0 where θj 1 l3l 3 and θj l3l 3 are the soil water content at time steps j 1 and j respectively θs is the saturated soil water content l3l 3 2 3 the modification of the field capacity under shallow water table depth conditions the field capacity varies with water table depth under shallow water table depth conditions cassel and nielsen 1986 cavazza et al 2007 nachabe 1998 the relationship between the field capacity and water table depth was assumed to be linear in this study more complex relationships can be used but they do not lead to significant improvements in results than the simple linear relationship the schematic diagram of the modification of the field capacity under shallow water table depth conditions is shown in fig 2 the equation is as follows 10 θ f ω θ f 11 ω 1 z w t d h d θ s θ f wtd z θ s θ f h d θ f w t d h d z w t d where θ ʹ f is the adjusted field capacity l3l 3 ω is the modification coefficient wtd is the water table depth l z is the soil depth below the soil surface l hd is the height of the capillary fringe l and hd is obtained by calibration the necessity of modifying the field capacity is discussed in section 4 1 the applicability of the linear relationship between field capacity and water table depth in different soil types is discussed in section 4 2 3 cases study in this section the basic information of the four adopted cases is described in detail in sections 3 1 3 4 the first two test cases were designed to evaluate the model accuracy and performance with different spatial and time steps and the impacts of parameters are also discussed the simulation results are compared with those obtained using hydrus 1d then a published example with a heterogeneous soil profile was adopted to validate the modified ubmod finally the modified ubmod was used to simulate a complex real world case to evaluate the performance of the modified ubmod two statistical indicators including the root mean square error rmse chai and draxler 2014 and the mean absolute percentage error mape hipni et al 2013 were used in this study which are calculated as follows 12 rmse k 1 nm p k o k 2 nm 13 mape 1 nm k 1 nm o k p k o k 100 where ok is the observed value pk is the estimated or predicted value nm is the number of measurements the values of rmse and mape close to 0 or 0 0 indicate good accuracy of the model 3 1 case 1 a loam case for discussing the influencing factors this case evaluated the performance of the modified ubmod with different spatial discretization and time steps and discussed the influence of the major parameters i e the capillary fringe the field capacity drainage functions and assumed hydraulic diffusivity of the top layer in the saturated zone the simulation results were compared with those obtained using hydrus 1d the soil column of this case was 2 m in length and the soil type was loam the initial water table depth was 0 92 m and the soil water content changed linearly from 0 2 cm3cm 3 at the ground surface to saturation 0 43 cm3cm 3 at the water table depth nine scenarios marked as s1 s9 were used to evaluate model performance with different spatial and time steps from the combination of three spatial discretization 0 02 m 0 1 m and 0 2 m and three time steps 0 1 d 0 5 d and 1 0 d besides six scenarios were used to test the impact of capillary fringe in which s1 s10 and s11 were under constant infiltration conditions while s12 s13 and s14 were used to test the stability of capillary fringe under complex meteorological conditions as shown in fig 3 a moreover scenario s15 which did not modify the field capacity was used to compare with s1 to verify the necessity of the modification of field capacity scenario s1 and another four scenarios marked as s16 s17 s18 and s19 were carried out to discuss the impact of the assumed hydraulic diffusivity values of the top layer in the saturated zone the adopted hydraulic diffusivity values were 0 396 m2d 1 1 m2d 1 10 m2d 1 100 m2d 1 and 1000 m2d 1 respectively and 0 396 m2d 1 was directly obtained from eq 5 at last scenario s1 and another four scenarios marked as s20 s21 s22 and s23 were used to discuss the influence of drainage functions in which the square linear exponential power and exponential approximation equations were evaluated respectively the setting information of these 23 scenarios is listed in table 2 the soil hydraulic parameters and field capacity for loam are listed in table 3 3 2 case 2 water flow simulation with various soil types in this example the modified ubmod was used to simulate water flow with various soil types the main purpose was to evaluate the model s applicability in various soil types the soil column was homogenous and 6 m in length the spatial discretization of both hydrus 1d and the modified ubmod were set as 0 05 m and the time step was a constant value of 0 1 day the simulation lasted for 300 days the same initial conditions i e soil water content profile and water table depth and upper boundary conditions were set for all soil types the upper boundary condition was set to alternate between continuous infiltration and evaporation as shown in fig 3 b the lower boundary was impermeable the square equation was adopted as the drainage function the soil hydraulic parameters and field capacity for 12 soil types given by carsel and parrish 1988 and ratliff et al 1983 are listed in table 3 3 3 case 3 a published example with water flow in a field soil profile under grass in this case a published example was used to verify the applicability of the modified ubmod and test the simulation accuracy this published example simulates 1 d water flow in a field profile of the hupselse beek watershed in the netherlands which is a built in example in the hydrus 1d software šimůnek et al 2013 the soil profile consisted of two soil types a 0 4 m thick upper layer and a 1 9 m thick lower layer the depth of the root zone was 0 3 m the soil hydraulic parameters field capacity and capillary fringe of the two soil types are listed in table 4 the calculation period was from april 1 to september 30 1982 which was a relatively dry year the upper boundary condition involved precipitation and transpiration for a grass cover and the values are shown in fig 4 the lower boundary was set as a deep drainage boundary in hydrus 1d however the cumulative bottom flux was only 0 015 m for 183 days in the hydrus 1d calculation which was significantly small therefore the bottom flux was ignored and the lower boundary condition was set as an impermeable boundary condition in this study the initial water table depth was 0 55 m the spatial discretization was 0 1 m and the time step was 0 1 d for the modified ubmod while actual observations were lacking the results simulated by hydrus 1d were reported to match well with observations císlerová 1987 šimůnek et al 2013 therefore the results obtained by hydrus 1d were used as the reference for this case due to the lack of an exhaustive observation of soil water content and the water table depth 3 4 case 4 real world application in the hetao irrigation district in this case the modified ubmod was used to simulate the actual soil water content and water table depth in an arid agricultural area the yonglian irrigation area 107 37 19 108 51 04 e 40 45 57 41 17 58 n in the hetao irrigation district china as shown in fig 5 the yonglian irrigation area covers 29 75 km2 with a flat gradient of 1 4000 from southwest to northeast the water table depths are less than 2 5 m which has a significant impact on crop growth there were six observation points distributed in the farmland of the study site as shown in fig 5 significant soil stratification was observed at the observation points soil samples with similar soil types were grouped into a soil layer for each observation point and the soil stratification for each observation point is shown in fig 6 a and the soil textural triangle based on the usda texture classification is shown in fig 6 b the soil water contents were measured every 10 days from may to october and the water table depths were measured every 5 days from may to november the soil water contents were measured at a depth of 0 1 m 0 3 m 0 5 m 0 7 m 1 0 m and 1 4 m table 8 lists the soil hydraulic parameters for different soil types in the yonglian irrigation area the values of residual soil water content θr and saturated hydraulic conductivity ks for each soil type were taken from carsel and parrish 1988 the saturated soil water content θs was obtained from the measurements which were provided by li 2009 the field capacity was determined using the method recommended by ratliff et al 1983 in this study the soil profile was set as 4 m and the lower boundary was impermeable the spatial discretization of the modified ubmod was set as 0 05 m table 9 the study area can be divided into three periods per year in terms of timing i e the crop growth period the autumn irrigation period and the fallow period the crop growth period is roughly from may to september each year while the autumn irrigation period is from october to november and the rest of the year is the fallow season in this study the simulation lasted 214 days which was from 1 may to 30 november in a year the dataset of 2004 was used to calibrate the hydraulic parameters and the dataset of 2007 was used to validate the model the daily irrigation data was collected from the regulation agency of the irrigation district the daily meteorological data was collected from the china meteorological data service center http data cma cn and the daily reference crop evapotranspiration et0 was calculated by the fao penman monteith method allen et al 1998 using the collected meteorological data the daily irrigation precipitation and et0 for 2004 and 2007 are shown in fig 7 the calculated sum of actual soil evaporation and crop transpiration eta are also shown in fig 7 which were calculated in three steps first the potential evapotranspiration was calculated based on the single crop coefficient method described in the fao 56 report allen et al 1998 then the potential soil evaporation and crop transpiration were divided by the ritchie type equation berengena and gavilán 2005 at last the actual soil evaporation and crop transpiration were calculated by multiplying with their soil stress coefficients based on the soil water deficit calculated at each time step 4 results and discussion this section analyzes the computational results of each case in detail and discusses the advantages and disadvantages of the model 4 1 results and discussion of the influencing factors model performance under various spatial discretization and time steps was analyzed the scenarios with different time steps e g s1 s3 had very similar performance fig 8 for simulated soil water content the rmse values were less than 0 015 cm3cm 3 and the mape values were less than 2 1 table 5 for simulated water table depth the rmse values were less than 0 020 m and the mape values were less than 2 2 table 5 however the performance of the modified ubmod tended to become worse with the increase of spatial discretization e g s3 s6 and s9 in fig 8 these three scenarios had a similar performance of the simulated soil water content rmse less than 0 015 cm3cm 3 mape less than 2 1 but for the simulated water table depth the rmse values were 0 020 m 0 039 m and 0 078 m for s3 s6 and s9 respectively and the mape values were 2 142 4 994 and 10 341 for s3 s6 and s9 respectively s3 with a spatial discretization of 0 02 m had the best results followed by s6 with a spatial discretization of 0 1 m and s9 with a spatial discretization of 0 2 m the poorer performance with large spatial discretization was caused by larger spatial discretization that gives more spatially averaged results making it difficult to capture the fine variation process of water table depth in general for all these nine scenarios with different spatial and time steps the mape values of the soil water content were less than 2 1 and the mape values of the water table depth were less than 10 5 which indicated that the modified ubmod had acceptable performance even with large spatial and time steps the impact of the height of the capillary fringe hd was analyzed scenarios with different hd s1 s10 and s11 had good performance in simulating soil water content profiles fig 9 a 9 e with rmse less than 0 008 cm3cm 3 and mape less than 1 3 table 5 however the hd values had a more obvious impact on the simulated water table depth than on the soil water content profiles scenario s10 hd 0 5 m slightly underestimated the water table depth and scenario s11 hd 0 7 m slightly overestimated the water table depth while scenario s1 had the most consistent water table depth with that of hydrus 1d rmse 0 013 m mape 1 169 although the water table depth obtained by s10 and s11 deviated slightly the simulated results were acceptable with rmse less than 0 056 m and mape less than 7 5 results of these three scenarios indicated that the height of the capillary fringe had a more pronounced impact on simulated water table depth than on the soil water content profiles but the effect was still not significant we further tested the stability of the height of the capillary fringe under complex meteorological conditions with scenarios s12 s13 and s14 among these three scenarios it can still be found that s13 with hd 0 6 m owned the most consistent results with that of hydrus 1d fig 9 f and the rmse and mape values were 0 037 m and 4 320 table 5 respectively although s12 hd 0 5 m slightly underestimated the water table depth and s14 hd 0 7 m slightly overestimated the water table depth both these two scenarios yielded acceptable results compared with hydrus 1d the rmse and mape values were 0 042 m and 4 280 for s12 and 0 076 m and 10 822 for s14 in general it can be concluded that the height of the capillary fringe was not sensitive to the upper boundary conditions and it was stable for a given soil type and had a small impact on simulating results in this section two scenarios s1 and s15 with and without modification of field capacity were compared it can be found that the simulated soil water content and water table depth of the modified ubmod without the modification of field capacity s15 deviated significantly from the results of hydrus 1d fig 9 a 9 e with rmse and mape of 0 023 cm3cm 3 and 3 505 for soil water content and those values of 0 293 m and 39 695 for water table depth respectively the unsatisfactory results were caused by the underestimation of the field capacity resulting in a shallower water table depth than that of hydrus 1d as shown in fig 9 e the simulated soil water content and water table depth of the modified ubmod with the modification of field capacity s1 matched well with those from hydrus 1d the statistical indicator values of the soil water content rmse 0 007 cm3cm 3 mape 1 067 and water table depth rmse 0 013 cm3cm 3 mape 1 169 demonstrated the necessity of modifying the field capacity the impact of the hydraulic diffusivity of the top layer in the saturated zone was analyzed based on 5 scenarios with different hydraulic diffusivity values s1 s16 s17 s18 and s19 these scenarios had very similar simulated results of the soil water content profiles and water table depths fig 10 for soil water content the rmse and mape of these scenarios were close to 0 007 cm3cm 3 and 1 067 respectively and for water table depth these values were close to 0 013 m and 1 162 respectively furthermore the net water fluxes across the saturated unsaturated interface were 0 039 m for all scenarios it can be concluded that the hydraulic diffusivity of the top layer in the saturated zone had a very slight impact on the simulation results and the assumption of a finite hydraulic diffusivity of the top layer in the saturated zone was reasonable the reason is that the amount of water diffusing from layer b 1 to layer b in a one time step is limited and the soil water content in both layers is almost the same therefore the error in the value of the hydraulic diffusivity has very small impact on the results model performance under different drainage functions was analyzed based on scenarios with different drainage functions s1 s20 s21 s22 and s23 the scenario with the square equation s1 had the best results for soil water content rmse 0 007 cm3cm 3 and mape 1 067 and for water table depth rmse 0 013 m and mape 1 169 the scenarios with the linear equation s20 and the exponential approximation equation s23 had similar performances fig 11 the rmse and mape values for the simulated soil water content were 0 008 cm3cm 3 and 1 270 for these two scenarios and the rmse and mape values for the simulated water table depth were close to 0 027 m and 3 054 the simulated water table depths of scenarios with the exponential equation s21 and the power equation s22 deviated significantly from that of hydrus 1d fig 11 and table 5 the reason was that both the exponential equation and power equation had an additional empirical parameter which lacked a reasonable basis for their values thus the square linear and exponential approximation drainage functions were recommended for the modified ubmod 4 2 simulation results with various soil types the simulated soil water content profiles of different soil types on the 200th day in case 2 were compared with those of hydrus 1d fig 12 a 12 l the simulated soil water contents of different soil types matched those of hydrus 1d well for the simulated soil water content the rmse values were less than 0 015 cm3cm 3 and the mape values were less than 1 803 which indicated the good performance of the modified ubmod to simulate the soil water content profiles with different soil types fig 12 m 12 x show the comparison of the simulated water table depths between the modified ubmod and hydurs 1d and the corresponding statistical indicator values are listed in table 6 the rmse values ranged from 0 013 m to 0 273 m with most of them less than 0 066 m and the mape values ranged from 2 263 to 10 99 with most of them less than 5 5 the unsatisfactory results were found in three soil types i e silty clay loam sandy clay and clay with rmse values ranging from 0 160 m to 0 273 m and mape values less than 11 0 all these three soil types with poor results had high clay content which may impede the movement of soil water in general the modified ubmod was applicable for unsaturated saturated water flow simulation under various soil types in addition the assumption of a linear relationship between field capacity and water table depth was applicable in different soil types due to the good simulation performance 4 3 simulation results and discussion of the published example for the published example it can be found that the simulated soil water content profiles matched well with the reference values fig 13 a 13 d and table 7 besides the rmse values were less than 0 026 cm3cm 3 and the mape values were less than 9 0 the results demonstrated the satisfactory performance of the modified ubmod soil water contents at the depth of 1 15 m over time simulated by the modified ubmod were consistent with the values simulated by hydrus 1d fig 13 e the rmse and mape values were 0 004 cm3cm 3 and 0 845 respectively which also demonstrated the good performance of the modified ubmod moreover the modified ubmod could simulate the water table depth well compared with hydrus 1d fig 13 f the rmse and mape values were 0 130 m and 9 841 respectively these satisfactory results of water table depth and soil water content implied the correctness of the modified ubmod then the water balance and computational costs were noticed the water balance error of the modified ubmod was very small where the maximum value was 0 00013 caused by the machine error while it was 1 6 for hydrus 1d caused by the numerical solution method the computational cost for the modified ubmod was 1 3 s for a personal computer with amd ryzen 7 3700x 8 core cpu and 32g ram while it was 1 6 s for hydrus 1d in general the modified ubmod had good applicability and practicability due to the satisfactory performance small water balance error and low computational cost compared to hydrus 1d the parameters used by the modified udmod are easily available the computational efficiency of the modified ubmod is about 20 higher than that of hydrus 1d in addition the water balance error of the modified ubmod is well controlled 4 4 model performance for the real world agricultural area with shallow water table depth in the yonglian irrigation area the simulated soil water content and water table depth for the real world case in the yonglian irrigation area were compared with measurements to estimate the model performance in real world agricultural areas with shallow water table depth the observed and simulated soil water content and water table depth of the six observation points in 2004 and 2007 are compared for average simulated soil water content in 2004 as shown in fig 14 the rmse values were less than 0 046 cm3cm 3 and the mape values were less than 11 8 the rmse values for water table depth were less than 0 255 m for average simulated soil water content in 2007 the rmse values were less than 0 053 cm3cm 3 and the mape values were less than 14 3 the rmse values for average water table depth were less than 0 180 m for the simulated soil water content in the six observation points in 2004 and 2007 as shown in fig 15 most rmse and mape values were less than 0 060 cm3cm 3 and 15 0 for the simulated water table depth in the six observation points the rmse values were less than 0 445 m and 0 357 m in 2004 and 2007 the calculated eta values were also compared with previous studies to estimate the model accuracy the calculated eta were 443 mm and 387 mm for 2004 and 2007 respectively which matched with previous studies wu 2007 li 2009 wu 2007 and li 2009 reported that the eta values were 430 mm and 394 mm for 2004 and 2007 respectively using a water balance model the actual crop transpiration accounted for 72 5 of eta in this study which was consistent with ren et al 2016 and yu et al 2019 ren et al 2016 reported that the actual crop transpiration accounted for 67 74 of eta and yu et al 2019 found that the actual crop transpiration accounted for 70 of eta in this irrigation district in this case a relatively larger error was found in the water table depth simulation the reason was that the observed groundwater table was above the surface during the autumn irrigation period which was not well simulated by the modified ubmod this phenomenon was caused by the fact that the amount of intensive irrigation during the autumn irrigation period was greater than the infiltration capacity of the soil thus allowing a large amount of water to accumulate on the surface in general considering the significant spatial variability and complicated upper boundary conditions of the study area these results indicated the good performance of the modified ubmod and each observation point had good simulating results showing the applicability of the modified ubmod 5 conclusion this study developed a water balance model based on ubmod and the water table depth fluctuation analysis the model accuracy and performance were evaluated by two designed cases a published case and a real world application with shallow groundwater table depth the major conclusions are as follows 1 the modified ubmod can solve the unsaturated saturated problems based on easily available parameters without strict requirements on the spatial and time steps fully guaranteeing the water balance and low computational cost which makes it well applicable to practical problems 2 the modification of field capacity is necessary and helpful to obtain reasonable water table depth the parameter used for field capacity modification is relatively stable for a given soil type and not sensitive to upper boundary conditions 3 the hydraulic diffusivity of the top layer in the saturated zone owns a very slight impact on the simulation of soil water content and water table depth in the modified ubmod 4 large spatial discretization may result in deviations and cannot accurately reflect the fine variation processes besides soil types with high clay content may lead to unsatisfactory results as water movement in these soil types may be impeded data availability all data and codes used in this study can be requested by email to the

2245,accurate estimation of soil water content and water table depth is important for making irrigation measures and rational groundwater use in arid agricultural areas with shallow water table depth soil water balance models are widely used due to their high computational efficiency while they are less applicable in areas with shallow water table depths because they usually ignore the matric potential in addition the effect of capillary rise on soil water state is also ignored to address these problems a flow model for partly and fully saturated soil referred to as modified ubmod was developed in this study based on ubmod and the water table depth fluctuation analysis ubmod is a soil water balance model that differs from other water balance models by considering soil water movement driven by matric potential in the modified ubmod soil water flow and groundwater recharge rate are calculated using the original ubmod algorithm and water table depth is calculated using the water table depth fluctuation analysis the field capacity used in the modified ubmod was considered as a variable related to the water table depth to reflect the impact of capillary rise which helps to obtain accurate water flux across the saturated unsaturated interface two synthetic cases simulated with hydrus were used to test the sensitivities of the model parameters and specifications two real world cases were used to show the fidelity of the model to the observed data the results demonstrated that the model could solve the unsaturated saturated problems based on more readily available parameters without stringent requirements on spatial and time steps with a full guarantee of water balance and low computational cost this study provides an effective tool for hydrodynamic studies in areas with shallow water table depths keywords unsaturated saturated model water balance model soil water content water table depth field capacity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction agricultural irrigation consumes about 70 to 90 of the world s total water in arid and semi arid regions babajimopoulos et al 2007 cai et al 2003 dubois 2011 xue et al 2020 which leads to a serious imbalance between water supply and demand in areas where surface water resource is scarce groundwater is an important resource for crop growth food security and ecosystems ge et al 2017 gleeson et al 2016 sebai et al 2017 shallow groundwater occurs in many regions around the world such as the riparian zone of streams wetland areas and cropland using river water for irrigation babajimopoulos et al 2007 gowing et al 2006 jalili et al 2011 karimov et al 2014 wang et al 2018 fan et al 2013 concluded that 22 to 32 of the global land area is affected by shallow groundwater including 15 as groundwater fed surface water features and 7 to 17 with groundwater recharged plant root uptake luo et al 2008 naumburg et al 2005 soylu et al 2011 yeh and famiglietti 2009 shallow groundwater can recharge the root zone through phreatic evaporation thus alleviating crop water deficit in arid and semi arid agricultural areas therefore accurate estimation of soil water dynamics and water table depth is important for making irrigation measures and rational use of groundwater under shallow groundwater conditions dorigo et al 2011 fan et al 2007 robock et al 2000 verstraeten et al 2008 zhao et al 2020 many numerical models have been developed to describe the water flow for partly and fully saturated soils most models are developed based on richards equation such as hydrus šimůnek et al 2012 swap van dam et al 2008 feflow diersch 2014 su3d dogan and motz 2005 hydrogeosphere brunner and simmons 2012 and modhms tian et al 2015 which are considered as rigorous approaches to describe water flow for partly and fully saturated soils due to their robust theoretical foundation pikul et al 1974 yang et al 2016 however these models where saturated and non saturated flow processes are fully integrated require intensive input data and model parameters based on a large number of measurement experiments and consume high computational costs because the highly nonlinear equations must be solved by repetitive iterations zhu et al 2012 zha et al 2019 in addition these models may have poor numerical stability performance when irrigation is applied to dry soils repeatedly zha et al 2019 which is a common phenomenon in arid and semi arid agricultural areas these reasons limit the practical application of numerical models to real world problems shen and phanikumar 2010 szymkiewicz et al 2018 van walsum and groenendijk 2008 due to these difficulties a number of water balance models also known as conceptual models have been developed including watbal berghuijs van dijk 1985 saltmod mao et al 2017 oosterbaan 1998 infil 3 0 fill 2008 swat arnold et al 2012 and rzsbm sun et al 2019 these models are computationally efficient and can provide reasonable estimates of the quantities of interest based on simple input parameters which are more easily extended to practical problems however many water balance models were developed for areas with deep water table depth more than 20 m chen et al 2010 jiang et al 2008 kendy et al 2003 kendy et al 2004 wang et al 2019 yang et al 2015 which only consider the water flow driven by gravitational potential and ignore the matric potential arnold et al 2012 fill 2008 jiang et al 2008 the matric potential should be considered in areas with shallow water table depths because the gravitational potential and the matric potential are of the same order liu et al 2019 in addition another problem of some traditional water balance models is the oversimplified treatment of heterogeneous soils to enhance the applicability of the water balance models in the real world mao et al 2018 developed a soil water balance model marked as ubmod which considers both gravitational potential and matric potential and can reasonably describe soil water flow in heterogeneous soils however the ubmod model was developed based on the soil water content θ form richards equation mao et al 2018 which is not suitable for describing saturated flow because soil water content cannot reflect the hydraulic gradient in the saturated zone hills et al 1989 therefore the model cannot be used in areas with shallow water table depths and significant groundwater capillary rise although the soil water content θ form richards equation cannot be used in the saturated zone it can be used as an unsaturated module and coupled with the saturated module to simulate water flow for partly and fully saturated soils the water flux across the groundwater table is the key variable connecting the saturated and unsaturated zones and has been commonly used to calculate the water table depth anuraga et al 2006 chinnasamy et al 2018 singh 2011 xu et al 2010 yue et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 however when the water table depth is shallow the soil moisture above the water table becomes significantly larger due to the influence of rising capillary water in traditional water balance models as well as ubmod field capacity is used to describe the soil water content that can be maintained in a soil layer specifically under the effect of gravitational potential the soil water content remains stable when the soil water content is less than the field capacity while soil water can percolate to the next layer when the soil water content exceeds the field capacity gandolfi et al 2006 the field capacity is treated as a constant value for a given soil texture in these models which is suitable for unsaturated flow with deeper water table depths cassel and nielsen 1986 however under shallow water table depth conditions the soil cannot be adequately drained by gravity and the amount of water that can be held by the soil above the water table is significantly greater than the field capacity resulting in inaccurate estimations of water flux across the groundwater table therefore the fixed field capacity assumption adopted by traditional water balance models and ubmod fails under shallow water table depth conditions and the field capacity above the water table should be modified cassel and nielsen 1986 cavazza et al 2007 nachabe 1998 raes et al 2018 and xiong et al 2019 adopted a parabolic function to adjust the field capacity above the water table when considering the impact of shallow water table depth liu et al 2019 2020 used the simplified brooks and corey soil moisture characteristic curve brooks and corey 1964 to estimate the field capacity the appropriate and simple parameterized adjusted function of the field capacity for ubmod should be estimated to obtain the accurate water flux across the unsaturated saturated interface in this study a new flow model for estimating soil water content and water table depth in shallow water table depth areas referred to as modified ubmod was developed based on ubmod mao et al 2018 and water table depth fluctuation analysis the field capacity in the modified ubmod was assumed to vary with the water table depth due to capillary rise this obtains an accurate water flux across the saturated unsaturated interface two synthetic test cases were designed to evaluate the performance of the model and to access the impact of parameters then a published example with a heterogeneous soil profile was adopted to verify the modified ubmod furthermore the modified ubmod was applied to a real world case in the hetao irrigation district located in the arid region of northwestern china the details of the modified ubmod were given in section 2 then four cases to test the model accuracy and performance were listed in section 3 followed by the results and discussion described in section 4 the conclusion was presented in section 5 2 model development in this section the modified ubmod will be introduced in detail the modified ubmod integrates an unsaturated module and a saturated module the unsaturated module is based on the ubmod which has been described in detail by mao et al 2018 and will be described in section 2 1 to ensure that this paper is self contained the saturated module is based on the water table depth fluctuation analysis which will be introduced in section 2 2 the schematic of the major calculation procedures of the model is shown in fig 1 the field capacity is treated as a variable that varies with groundwater table depth which will be described in section 2 3 the upper and lower boundary conditions of the model can be set as either first type boundary conditions or second type boundary conditions 2 1 the unsaturated module the unsaturated module consists of four procedures as shown in the first four procedures in fig 1 firstly the allocation of the infiltration water is calculated the one dimensional 1 d vertical soil column is divided into n soil layers which include both the saturated zone and the unsaturated zone the unsaturated zone is assumed to have a total of b layers and the groundwater table is at the lower boundary of layer b the infiltration water fills the soil layers in the unsaturated zone from layer 1 to layer b to be saturated from top to bottom until all the infiltration water is consumed the residual water is considered to be a surface runoff and no excess infiltration water can cross the saturated unsaturated interface in this procedure the amount of the allocated water for layer i is 1 q i min m i θ s i θ i i i d i 1 where i i 1 b is the vertical soil layer qi is the amount of allocated water per unit area of layer i l mi is the thickness of layer i l θs i is the saturated soil water content of layer i l3l 3 θi is the initial soil water content of layer i l3l 3 i is the amount of infiltration water per unit area l id i 1 is the consumed infiltration water per unit area of all upper layers above layer i l secondly the soil water will move downward driven by the gravitational potential when the soil water content of a layer exceeds the field capacity the governing equation is 2 θ t k θ z where θ is the soil water content l3l 3 t is the time t z is the soil depth below the soil surface l k θ is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity lt 1 six commonly used empirical functions for calculating k θ also known as drainage functions embedded in ubmod are listed in table 1 the soil water flux into the saturated zone caused by the gravitational potential is denoted as dq as shown in fig 1 then the soil water movement driven by the sink term is calculated the governing equation is 3 θ t w where w is the sink term t 1 including soil evaporation and the root uptake term due to crop transpiration the penman monteith equation is used to calculate the potential evapotranspiration eto first then the ritchie type equation is used to estimate the potential soil evaporation ep and potential crop transpiration tp based on crop coefficient kc and leaf area index lai in addition the evaporation cumulative distribution function and the root density function are used the assign ep and tp to each soil layers the daily crop coefficient kc leaf area index lai and root depth rd are calculated based on a crop growth module the actual soil evaporation ea and crop transpiration ta are obtained by discounting ep and tp with the soil water stress coefficient the actual soil evaporation ea and crop transpiration ta will be reduced directly from the soil water content of the corresponding soil layers when the critical depth of evapotranspiration is shallower than the water table depth groundwater can also be consumed by soil evaporation or crop transpiration and the term caused by evapotranspiration from the saturated zone to the unsaturated zone is uq as shown in fig 1 lastly the soil water diffusive movement driven by the matric potential is calculated the computational region of this step is the whole unsaturated zone layer 1 to layer b and the top layer of the saturated zone b 1 layer the governing equation is 4 θ t z d θ θ z l 1 l θ p l p l z where d θ is the hydraulic diffusivity l2t 1 pl l 1 l are the parameters of the soil water retention function and l is the number of parameters the term l 1 l θ p l p l z is the modification term describing the effect of soil heterogeneity there is an upward flux across the saturated unsaturated interface caused by the soil water diffusive movement driven by the matric potential denoted as df the details for solving eq 4 can be found in the appendix the hydraulic diffusivity is calculated by an empirical formula 5 d θ 10 a s b where s is the effective saturation a and b are two intermediate parameters relationships between these two parameters and the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks are established as 6 a 2 87 log 10 k s 2 2 50 log 10 k s 4 23 b 2 42 log 10 k s 2 0 49 log 10 k s 3 58 the units of d θ in eq 5 and ks in eq 6 are m2 d and m d respectively by following eq 5 and eq 6 the hydraulic diffusivity is calculated using three physically significant parameters saturated hydraulic conductivity ks saturated water content θ s and residual water content θr and the soil water content θ ubmod is not a strictly numerical solution model and the stepwise calculations may introduce computational errors into ubmod however in our previous study the results indicate that the error is small mao et al 2008 we sacrifice some computational accuracy in exchange for some other characteristics such as good computational stability and efficiency lower requirements on parameters and coarser restrictions on spatio temporal steps the hydraulic diffusivity of the saturated zone is numerically infinite based on soil water characteristic curves such as the van genuchten model the finite value calculated by eq 5 is used to describe the hydraulic diffusivity in the saturation case where the diffusive movement driven by the matric potential across the saturated unsaturated interface is calculated based on the assumed hydraulic diffusivity the impact of the assumed hydraulic diffusivity is discussed in section 4 1 2 2 the saturated module the unsaturated module describes the soil water movement and can obtain the net water flux across the saturated unsaturated interface the water table depth is calculated by the water table depth fluctuation analysis in the saturated module the equations are as follows 7 wt d j 1 w t d j fq μ 8 fq d q u q d f where wtdj 1 l and wtdj l are the water table depths at the time steps of j 1 and j respectively μ is the specific yield fq is the net water flux across the saturated unsaturated interface per unit area l dq l uq l and df l are the water fluxes across the saturated unsaturated interface per unit area caused by water movement driven by the gravitational potential sink terms by external forces and water movement driven by the matric potential respectively although studies have shown that specific yield is related to soil type water table depth and water dynamics in the unsaturated zone and equations have been proposed for some cases nachabe 2002 shah and ross 2009 gumuła kawęcka et al 2022 it is still difficult to find a general expression that can describe the specific yield for various complex cases in addition a varying specific yield can greatly reduce the computational stability of the model therefore the specific yield is currently an independent and constant input variable when the current water table depth is updated the soil water content between wtdj and wtdj 1 should be updated as 9 θ j 1 θ s f q 0 θ j f q 0 θ s μ f q 0 where θj 1 l3l 3 and θj l3l 3 are the soil water content at time steps j 1 and j respectively θs is the saturated soil water content l3l 3 2 3 the modification of the field capacity under shallow water table depth conditions the field capacity varies with water table depth under shallow water table depth conditions cassel and nielsen 1986 cavazza et al 2007 nachabe 1998 the relationship between the field capacity and water table depth was assumed to be linear in this study more complex relationships can be used but they do not lead to significant improvements in results than the simple linear relationship the schematic diagram of the modification of the field capacity under shallow water table depth conditions is shown in fig 2 the equation is as follows 10 θ f ω θ f 11 ω 1 z w t d h d θ s θ f wtd z θ s θ f h d θ f w t d h d z w t d where θ ʹ f is the adjusted field capacity l3l 3 ω is the modification coefficient wtd is the water table depth l z is the soil depth below the soil surface l hd is the height of the capillary fringe l and hd is obtained by calibration the necessity of modifying the field capacity is discussed in section 4 1 the applicability of the linear relationship between field capacity and water table depth in different soil types is discussed in section 4 2 3 cases study in this section the basic information of the four adopted cases is described in detail in sections 3 1 3 4 the first two test cases were designed to evaluate the model accuracy and performance with different spatial and time steps and the impacts of parameters are also discussed the simulation results are compared with those obtained using hydrus 1d then a published example with a heterogeneous soil profile was adopted to validate the modified ubmod finally the modified ubmod was used to simulate a complex real world case to evaluate the performance of the modified ubmod two statistical indicators including the root mean square error rmse chai and draxler 2014 and the mean absolute percentage error mape hipni et al 2013 were used in this study which are calculated as follows 12 rmse k 1 nm p k o k 2 nm 13 mape 1 nm k 1 nm o k p k o k 100 where ok is the observed value pk is the estimated or predicted value nm is the number of measurements the values of rmse and mape close to 0 or 0 0 indicate good accuracy of the model 3 1 case 1 a loam case for discussing the influencing factors this case evaluated the performance of the modified ubmod with different spatial discretization and time steps and discussed the influence of the major parameters i e the capillary fringe the field capacity drainage functions and assumed hydraulic diffusivity of the top layer in the saturated zone the simulation results were compared with those obtained using hydrus 1d the soil column of this case was 2 m in length and the soil type was loam the initial water table depth was 0 92 m and the soil water content changed linearly from 0 2 cm3cm 3 at the ground surface to saturation 0 43 cm3cm 3 at the water table depth nine scenarios marked as s1 s9 were used to evaluate model performance with different spatial and time steps from the combination of three spatial discretization 0 02 m 0 1 m and 0 2 m and three time steps 0 1 d 0 5 d and 1 0 d besides six scenarios were used to test the impact of capillary fringe in which s1 s10 and s11 were under constant infiltration conditions while s12 s13 and s14 were used to test the stability of capillary fringe under complex meteorological conditions as shown in fig 3 a moreover scenario s15 which did not modify the field capacity was used to compare with s1 to verify the necessity of the modification of field capacity scenario s1 and another four scenarios marked as s16 s17 s18 and s19 were carried out to discuss the impact of the assumed hydraulic diffusivity values of the top layer in the saturated zone the adopted hydraulic diffusivity values were 0 396 m2d 1 1 m2d 1 10 m2d 1 100 m2d 1 and 1000 m2d 1 respectively and 0 396 m2d 1 was directly obtained from eq 5 at last scenario s1 and another four scenarios marked as s20 s21 s22 and s23 were used to discuss the influence of drainage functions in which the square linear exponential power and exponential approximation equations were evaluated respectively the setting information of these 23 scenarios is listed in table 2 the soil hydraulic parameters and field capacity for loam are listed in table 3 3 2 case 2 water flow simulation with various soil types in this example the modified ubmod was used to simulate water flow with various soil types the main purpose was to evaluate the model s applicability in various soil types the soil column was homogenous and 6 m in length the spatial discretization of both hydrus 1d and the modified ubmod were set as 0 05 m and the time step was a constant value of 0 1 day the simulation lasted for 300 days the same initial conditions i e soil water content profile and water table depth and upper boundary conditions were set for all soil types the upper boundary condition was set to alternate between continuous infiltration and evaporation as shown in fig 3 b the lower boundary was impermeable the square equation was adopted as the drainage function the soil hydraulic parameters and field capacity for 12 soil types given by carsel and parrish 1988 and ratliff et al 1983 are listed in table 3 3 3 case 3 a published example with water flow in a field soil profile under grass in this case a published example was used to verify the applicability of the modified ubmod and test the simulation accuracy this published example simulates 1 d water flow in a field profile of the hupselse beek watershed in the netherlands which is a built in example in the hydrus 1d software šimůnek et al 2013 the soil profile consisted of two soil types a 0 4 m thick upper layer and a 1 9 m thick lower layer the depth of the root zone was 0 3 m the soil hydraulic parameters field capacity and capillary fringe of the two soil types are listed in table 4 the calculation period was from april 1 to september 30 1982 which was a relatively dry year the upper boundary condition involved precipitation and transpiration for a grass cover and the values are shown in fig 4 the lower boundary was set as a deep drainage boundary in hydrus 1d however the cumulative bottom flux was only 0 015 m for 183 days in the hydrus 1d calculation which was significantly small therefore the bottom flux was ignored and the lower boundary condition was set as an impermeable boundary condition in this study the initial water table depth was 0 55 m the spatial discretization was 0 1 m and the time step was 0 1 d for the modified ubmod while actual observations were lacking the results simulated by hydrus 1d were reported to match well with observations císlerová 1987 šimůnek et al 2013 therefore the results obtained by hydrus 1d were used as the reference for this case due to the lack of an exhaustive observation of soil water content and the water table depth 3 4 case 4 real world application in the hetao irrigation district in this case the modified ubmod was used to simulate the actual soil water content and water table depth in an arid agricultural area the yonglian irrigation area 107 37 19 108 51 04 e 40 45 57 41 17 58 n in the hetao irrigation district china as shown in fig 5 the yonglian irrigation area covers 29 75 km2 with a flat gradient of 1 4000 from southwest to northeast the water table depths are less than 2 5 m which has a significant impact on crop growth there were six observation points distributed in the farmland of the study site as shown in fig 5 significant soil stratification was observed at the observation points soil samples with similar soil types were grouped into a soil layer for each observation point and the soil stratification for each observation point is shown in fig 6 a and the soil textural triangle based on the usda texture classification is shown in fig 6 b the soil water contents were measured every 10 days from may to october and the water table depths were measured every 5 days from may to november the soil water contents were measured at a depth of 0 1 m 0 3 m 0 5 m 0 7 m 1 0 m and 1 4 m table 8 lists the soil hydraulic parameters for different soil types in the yonglian irrigation area the values of residual soil water content θr and saturated hydraulic conductivity ks for each soil type were taken from carsel and parrish 1988 the saturated soil water content θs was obtained from the measurements which were provided by li 2009 the field capacity was determined using the method recommended by ratliff et al 1983 in this study the soil profile was set as 4 m and the lower boundary was impermeable the spatial discretization of the modified ubmod was set as 0 05 m table 9 the study area can be divided into three periods per year in terms of timing i e the crop growth period the autumn irrigation period and the fallow period the crop growth period is roughly from may to september each year while the autumn irrigation period is from october to november and the rest of the year is the fallow season in this study the simulation lasted 214 days which was from 1 may to 30 november in a year the dataset of 2004 was used to calibrate the hydraulic parameters and the dataset of 2007 was used to validate the model the daily irrigation data was collected from the regulation agency of the irrigation district the daily meteorological data was collected from the china meteorological data service center http data cma cn and the daily reference crop evapotranspiration et0 was calculated by the fao penman monteith method allen et al 1998 using the collected meteorological data the daily irrigation precipitation and et0 for 2004 and 2007 are shown in fig 7 the calculated sum of actual soil evaporation and crop transpiration eta are also shown in fig 7 which were calculated in three steps first the potential evapotranspiration was calculated based on the single crop coefficient method described in the fao 56 report allen et al 1998 then the potential soil evaporation and crop transpiration were divided by the ritchie type equation berengena and gavilán 2005 at last the actual soil evaporation and crop transpiration were calculated by multiplying with their soil stress coefficients based on the soil water deficit calculated at each time step 4 results and discussion this section analyzes the computational results of each case in detail and discusses the advantages and disadvantages of the model 4 1 results and discussion of the influencing factors model performance under various spatial discretization and time steps was analyzed the scenarios with different time steps e g s1 s3 had very similar performance fig 8 for simulated soil water content the rmse values were less than 0 015 cm3cm 3 and the mape values were less than 2 1 table 5 for simulated water table depth the rmse values were less than 0 020 m and the mape values were less than 2 2 table 5 however the performance of the modified ubmod tended to become worse with the increase of spatial discretization e g s3 s6 and s9 in fig 8 these three scenarios had a similar performance of the simulated soil water content rmse less than 0 015 cm3cm 3 mape less than 2 1 but for the simulated water table depth the rmse values were 0 020 m 0 039 m and 0 078 m for s3 s6 and s9 respectively and the mape values were 2 142 4 994 and 10 341 for s3 s6 and s9 respectively s3 with a spatial discretization of 0 02 m had the best results followed by s6 with a spatial discretization of 0 1 m and s9 with a spatial discretization of 0 2 m the poorer performance with large spatial discretization was caused by larger spatial discretization that gives more spatially averaged results making it difficult to capture the fine variation process of water table depth in general for all these nine scenarios with different spatial and time steps the mape values of the soil water content were less than 2 1 and the mape values of the water table depth were less than 10 5 which indicated that the modified ubmod had acceptable performance even with large spatial and time steps the impact of the height of the capillary fringe hd was analyzed scenarios with different hd s1 s10 and s11 had good performance in simulating soil water content profiles fig 9 a 9 e with rmse less than 0 008 cm3cm 3 and mape less than 1 3 table 5 however the hd values had a more obvious impact on the simulated water table depth than on the soil water content profiles scenario s10 hd 0 5 m slightly underestimated the water table depth and scenario s11 hd 0 7 m slightly overestimated the water table depth while scenario s1 had the most consistent water table depth with that of hydrus 1d rmse 0 013 m mape 1 169 although the water table depth obtained by s10 and s11 deviated slightly the simulated results were acceptable with rmse less than 0 056 m and mape less than 7 5 results of these three scenarios indicated that the height of the capillary fringe had a more pronounced impact on simulated water table depth than on the soil water content profiles but the effect was still not significant we further tested the stability of the height of the capillary fringe under complex meteorological conditions with scenarios s12 s13 and s14 among these three scenarios it can still be found that s13 with hd 0 6 m owned the most consistent results with that of hydrus 1d fig 9 f and the rmse and mape values were 0 037 m and 4 320 table 5 respectively although s12 hd 0 5 m slightly underestimated the water table depth and s14 hd 0 7 m slightly overestimated the water table depth both these two scenarios yielded acceptable results compared with hydrus 1d the rmse and mape values were 0 042 m and 4 280 for s12 and 0 076 m and 10 822 for s14 in general it can be concluded that the height of the capillary fringe was not sensitive to the upper boundary conditions and it was stable for a given soil type and had a small impact on simulating results in this section two scenarios s1 and s15 with and without modification of field capacity were compared it can be found that the simulated soil water content and water table depth of the modified ubmod without the modification of field capacity s15 deviated significantly from the results of hydrus 1d fig 9 a 9 e with rmse and mape of 0 023 cm3cm 3 and 3 505 for soil water content and those values of 0 293 m and 39 695 for water table depth respectively the unsatisfactory results were caused by the underestimation of the field capacity resulting in a shallower water table depth than that of hydrus 1d as shown in fig 9 e the simulated soil water content and water table depth of the modified ubmod with the modification of field capacity s1 matched well with those from hydrus 1d the statistical indicator values of the soil water content rmse 0 007 cm3cm 3 mape 1 067 and water table depth rmse 0 013 cm3cm 3 mape 1 169 demonstrated the necessity of modifying the field capacity the impact of the hydraulic diffusivity of the top layer in the saturated zone was analyzed based on 5 scenarios with different hydraulic diffusivity values s1 s16 s17 s18 and s19 these scenarios had very similar simulated results of the soil water content profiles and water table depths fig 10 for soil water content the rmse and mape of these scenarios were close to 0 007 cm3cm 3 and 1 067 respectively and for water table depth these values were close to 0 013 m and 1 162 respectively furthermore the net water fluxes across the saturated unsaturated interface were 0 039 m for all scenarios it can be concluded that the hydraulic diffusivity of the top layer in the saturated zone had a very slight impact on the simulation results and the assumption of a finite hydraulic diffusivity of the top layer in the saturated zone was reasonable the reason is that the amount of water diffusing from layer b 1 to layer b in a one time step is limited and the soil water content in both layers is almost the same therefore the error in the value of the hydraulic diffusivity has very small impact on the results model performance under different drainage functions was analyzed based on scenarios with different drainage functions s1 s20 s21 s22 and s23 the scenario with the square equation s1 had the best results for soil water content rmse 0 007 cm3cm 3 and mape 1 067 and for water table depth rmse 0 013 m and mape 1 169 the scenarios with the linear equation s20 and the exponential approximation equation s23 had similar performances fig 11 the rmse and mape values for the simulated soil water content were 0 008 cm3cm 3 and 1 270 for these two scenarios and the rmse and mape values for the simulated water table depth were close to 0 027 m and 3 054 the simulated water table depths of scenarios with the exponential equation s21 and the power equation s22 deviated significantly from that of hydrus 1d fig 11 and table 5 the reason was that both the exponential equation and power equation had an additional empirical parameter which lacked a reasonable basis for their values thus the square linear and exponential approximation drainage functions were recommended for the modified ubmod 4 2 simulation results with various soil types the simulated soil water content profiles of different soil types on the 200th day in case 2 were compared with those of hydrus 1d fig 12 a 12 l the simulated soil water contents of different soil types matched those of hydrus 1d well for the simulated soil water content the rmse values were less than 0 015 cm3cm 3 and the mape values were less than 1 803 which indicated the good performance of the modified ubmod to simulate the soil water content profiles with different soil types fig 12 m 12 x show the comparison of the simulated water table depths between the modified ubmod and hydurs 1d and the corresponding statistical indicator values are listed in table 6 the rmse values ranged from 0 013 m to 0 273 m with most of them less than 0 066 m and the mape values ranged from 2 263 to 10 99 with most of them less than 5 5 the unsatisfactory results were found in three soil types i e silty clay loam sandy clay and clay with rmse values ranging from 0 160 m to 0 273 m and mape values less than 11 0 all these three soil types with poor results had high clay content which may impede the movement of soil water in general the modified ubmod was applicable for unsaturated saturated water flow simulation under various soil types in addition the assumption of a linear relationship between field capacity and water table depth was applicable in different soil types due to the good simulation performance 4 3 simulation results and discussion of the published example for the published example it can be found that the simulated soil water content profiles matched well with the reference values fig 13 a 13 d and table 7 besides the rmse values were less than 0 026 cm3cm 3 and the mape values were less than 9 0 the results demonstrated the satisfactory performance of the modified ubmod soil water contents at the depth of 1 15 m over time simulated by the modified ubmod were consistent with the values simulated by hydrus 1d fig 13 e the rmse and mape values were 0 004 cm3cm 3 and 0 845 respectively which also demonstrated the good performance of the modified ubmod moreover the modified ubmod could simulate the water table depth well compared with hydrus 1d fig 13 f the rmse and mape values were 0 130 m and 9 841 respectively these satisfactory results of water table depth and soil water content implied the correctness of the modified ubmod then the water balance and computational costs were noticed the water balance error of the modified ubmod was very small where the maximum value was 0 00013 caused by the machine error while it was 1 6 for hydrus 1d caused by the numerical solution method the computational cost for the modified ubmod was 1 3 s for a personal computer with amd ryzen 7 3700x 8 core cpu and 32g ram while it was 1 6 s for hydrus 1d in general the modified ubmod had good applicability and practicability due to the satisfactory performance small water balance error and low computational cost compared to hydrus 1d the parameters used by the modified udmod are easily available the computational efficiency of the modified ubmod is about 20 higher than that of hydrus 1d in addition the water balance error of the modified ubmod is well controlled 4 4 model performance for the real world agricultural area with shallow water table depth in the yonglian irrigation area the simulated soil water content and water table depth for the real world case in the yonglian irrigation area were compared with measurements to estimate the model performance in real world agricultural areas with shallow water table depth the observed and simulated soil water content and water table depth of the six observation points in 2004 and 2007 are compared for average simulated soil water content in 2004 as shown in fig 14 the rmse values were less than 0 046 cm3cm 3 and the mape values were less than 11 8 the rmse values for water table depth were less than 0 255 m for average simulated soil water content in 2007 the rmse values were less than 0 053 cm3cm 3 and the mape values were less than 14 3 the rmse values for average water table depth were less than 0 180 m for the simulated soil water content in the six observation points in 2004 and 2007 as shown in fig 15 most rmse and mape values were less than 0 060 cm3cm 3 and 15 0 for the simulated water table depth in the six observation points the rmse values were less than 0 445 m and 0 357 m in 2004 and 2007 the calculated eta values were also compared with previous studies to estimate the model accuracy the calculated eta were 443 mm and 387 mm for 2004 and 2007 respectively which matched with previous studies wu 2007 li 2009 wu 2007 and li 2009 reported that the eta values were 430 mm and 394 mm for 2004 and 2007 respectively using a water balance model the actual crop transpiration accounted for 72 5 of eta in this study which was consistent with ren et al 2016 and yu et al 2019 ren et al 2016 reported that the actual crop transpiration accounted for 67 74 of eta and yu et al 2019 found that the actual crop transpiration accounted for 70 of eta in this irrigation district in this case a relatively larger error was found in the water table depth simulation the reason was that the observed groundwater table was above the surface during the autumn irrigation period which was not well simulated by the modified ubmod this phenomenon was caused by the fact that the amount of intensive irrigation during the autumn irrigation period was greater than the infiltration capacity of the soil thus allowing a large amount of water to accumulate on the surface in general considering the significant spatial variability and complicated upper boundary conditions of the study area these results indicated the good performance of the modified ubmod and each observation point had good simulating results showing the applicability of the modified ubmod 5 conclusion this study developed a water balance model based on ubmod and the water table depth fluctuation analysis the model accuracy and performance were evaluated by two designed cases a published case and a real world application with shallow groundwater table depth the major conclusions are as follows 1 the modified ubmod can solve the unsaturated saturated problems based on easily available parameters without strict requirements on the spatial and time steps fully guaranteeing the water balance and low computational cost which makes it well applicable to practical problems 2 the modification of field capacity is necessary and helpful to obtain reasonable water table depth the parameter used for field capacity modification is relatively stable for a given soil type and not sensitive to upper boundary conditions 3 the hydraulic diffusivity of the top layer in the saturated zone owns a very slight impact on the simulation of soil water content and water table depth in the modified ubmod 4 large spatial discretization may result in deviations and cannot accurately reflect the fine variation processes besides soil types with high clay content may lead to unsatisfactory results as water movement in these soil types may be impeded data availability all data and codes used in this study can be requested by email to the

2246,floods usually threaten human lives and cause serious economic losses which can be more severe with global warming therefore it is a salient challenge to find out how global flood characteristic changes and whether current flood protection standards will face more pressures this study aims to characterize changes in global floods and explicit flood defense pressures in warming climates of 1 5 3 0 c above pre industrial levels by running four well calibrated lumped hydrological models using bias corrected global climate model gcm simulations for 9045 watersheds worldwide the results show that global warming from 1 5 to 3 0 c has increasingly dominated all continents with amplification effects on changes of flood frequency and magnitude southeast eurasia africa and south america are hotspots of changes for significant proportions of watersheds with larger flood patterns and greater changing extents than others for example for the 3 0 c warming period under the combination of shared socioeconomic pathway 2 and representative concentration pathway 4 5 ssp245 scenario the regionally averaged 50 year flood magnitude will increase by 25 6 30 6 and 16 4 for these regions respectively the increases in occurrence and magnitude indicate that current flood protection standards will face increasing pressures in future warming climates the design level flood frequency is projected to increase for about 47 55 70 and 74 of watersheds in 1 5 2 0 2 5 and 3 0 c warming periods under the ssp245 scenario however large uncertainty are observed for the change of flood characteristics dominated by gcms and their interactions with ssp scenarios and hydrological models this study implies that the current flood defense standards should be enhanced and climate adaptation and mitigation strategies should be proposed to cope the change of future flood plain language summary floods usually threaten human lives and cause serious economic losses which can be more severe in the context of global warming it is a salient challenge to find out how global flood risk changes and whether current flood protection standards will face more pressures this study aims to characterize changes in global floods and explicit flood defense pressures in warming climates of 1 5 2 0 2 5 and 3 0 c above pre industrial levels here we show that amplification effects of higher air temperature on the range of changes in flood frequency and magnitude are projected southeast eurasia africa and south america are hotspots of changes for significant proportions of watersheds with larger flood patterns and greater changing extents than others most watersheds worldwide is likely to face increasing flood defense pressures in warming climates our findings could improve the understanding of future flood conditions under the warming climates and provide information to mitigation and adaptation policymaking keywords global warming global climate models floods flood protection standards data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the global air temperature has continuously increased resulting in a more dangerous world fischer knutti 2015 foster rahmstorf 2011 as warmer atmosphere increases water vapor concentration and water transport held soden 2006 wang et al 2017 the impact of global warming on the intensification process of the hydrological cycle has become an indisputable fact many studies e g hirabayashi et al 2013 musselman et al 2018 have shown that the flood risk responding to global warming often appears as an increasing pattern in both occurrence and magnitude at the regional scale which would consequently bring more disasters to the global population property and infrastructure systems bubeck et al 2019 de moel et al 2011 jevrejeva et al 2018 winsemius et al 2016 to reduce the negative impacts of global warming the paris agreement has proposed as a legally binding international treaty on climate change with the goal to hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 c above pre industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1 5 c above pre industrial levels agreement 2015 however the emissions gap report 2021 shows that the new and updated climate pledges reported by countries lag far behind what is required to achieve the paris agreement temperature constraining targets which means the world is on track for global warming of 2 7 c by the end of 21st century unep 2021 that would lead to catastrophic changes in the earth s system including the hydrological cycle therefore a good understanding of future flood conditions under the warming climate is paramount in helping governments and non governmental organizations make strategies for flood mitigations and adaptations in the past decades endeavors have been devoted to assessing the responses of flood characteristics and risks to global warming at various spatial scales from small watersheds to continental and global scales with different definitions of flood and warming periods when assessing the changes in future flood characteristics at the watershed scale watershed hydrological models are often adopted to simulate streamflow sequence for future periods many researches have concluded that flood magnitude and frequency would increase with the rising temperature for example aich et al 2014 drove the swim model to simulate runoffs for four watersheds in africa and found remarkable increases in the streamflow peaks during the rainy season for three watersheds with global warming roudier et al 2016 used an ensemble of 3 pan european hydrological models and projected an apparent increase in the magnitude of 10 and 100 year floods for most areas of europe under the warming of 2 0 c above pre industrial levels huang et al 2018 used three hydrological models i e vic swim and mhm over four large global watersheds and found that the 100 year flood magnitude is projected to increase by 13 16 in the rhine and mississippi 31 in the yellow under the 3 0 c warming level whereas decrease by about 20 in the niger from the global perspective some studies also investigated the change in flood characteristics by driving global hydrological models ghms using climate simulations under different warming levels for example asadieh and krakauer 2017 concluded that the changes in the magnitude of streamflow extremes for the more than 4 0 c warming level by the end of the 21st century are projected to be about twice as large as at the 2 0 warming level dankers et al 2014 have shown that the increases in the magnitude and frequency of the 30 year peak flows would occur at roughly two thirds of the global land areas by using nine global hydrology and land surface models alfieri et al 2017 drove the lisflood model and projected that the return period of floods would significantly decrease for the 1 5 2 0 and 4 0 c warming periods above pre industrial level compared with the reference period 1975 2005 arnell and gosling 2016 projected that current 100 year floods would occur twice at least by 2050 across 40 of the world by using the mac pdm 09 model for runoff simulations and nearly 450 million people and 430 thousand km2 cropland will be exposed to this change the population exposure under future scenarios was also investigated by other studies such as alfieri et al 2017 and hirabayashi et al 2013 in addition some studies also used gridded runoff to investigate the change of flood characteristics for example hirabayashi et al 2013 used the global grid runoff extracted from the atmosphere ocean general circulation model aogcm of the cmip5 dataset and projected that the frequency of 100 year flood for the 2071 2100 period would increase over the south and southeast asia northern eurasia south america and tropical africa compared to the 1971 2000 period even though the use of ghms or gridded runoffs can investigate the response of flood regimes to global warming for a large range of the world these models are usually not well calibrated for flood simulations alfieri et al 2017 beck et al 2016 dottori et al 2018 gosling et al 2017 in particular the use of ghm usually focuses on runoff generations at the grid scale rather than floods at watershed outlets the use of the well calibrated watershed hydrological model is usually considered to be more reliable for flood or extreme flow simulations at the watershed outlet alfieri et al 2018 krysanova et al 2018 veldkamp et al 2018 ward et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 however the use of multiple well calibrated watershed hydrological models to quantify the impacts of climate warming on global floods is still lack the use of multiple climate models and hydrological model is feasible to investigate the uncertainty of each source and their interactions moreover most of the previous studies only investigated the change of flood characteristics in a changing climate while not linking the change of flood characteristics to the current flood protection standards the link of current flood protection standards to the change of flood characteristics is the first step to be aware of the flood defense pressure which is useful to inform climate change policy and flood risk management jevrejeva et al 2018 accordingly the objectives of this study are to quantify the response of extremely high streamflow hereinafter referred to as flood to restricted 1 5 2 0 2 5 and 3 0 c warming levels above pre industrial level at the global scale and investigate their implications to current flood protection standards to obtained robust results all assessments were based on hydrological simulations from four well calibrated hydrological models over 9 045 watersheds distributed over various hydro meteorological regimes in the world the change of pressures for the current flood protection standards is assessed by using the global dataset of flood protection standards flopros developed by scussolini et al 2016 2 datasets 2 1 meteorological and hydrological observations the gridded meteorological dataset was extracted from the global precipitation climatology centre gpcc v 2018 and the climate prediction centre cpc the dataset includes the observed daily precipitation with a 1 1 spatial resolution and the daily maximum minimum temperature with a 0 5 0 5 spatial resolution in addition the observed daily streamflow dataset was derived from three sources i e the global runoff data centers grdc hydrometeorological sandbox école de technologie supérieure hysets database for north america arsenault et al 2020 and some watersheds in china gu et al 2020a to ensure parameters of hydrological models being well calibrated watersheds with streamflow time series longer than 20 years were selected the watersheds cover a wide range of climate regimes of the global surface 2 2 climate simulations daily precipitation maximum temperature and minimum temperature simulations extracted from 15 gcms provided by the coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 cmip6 https esgf node llnl gov projects cmip6 were used in this study these 15 gcms were derived from various climate centers the details are shown in table s1 these gcms were driven by historical forcing before 2015 and driven by two combinations of shared socioeconomic pathways ssps and representative concentration pathways rcps for convenience ssp245 ssp2 rcp4 5 and ssp585 ssp5 rcp8 5 were used for each gcm afterward the ssp245 scenario represents an intermediate development pathway in a moderate world while ssp585 represents a high development pathway in a world with rapid fossil fuel evolution o neill et al 2016 o neill et al 2017 riahi et al 2017 ssp126 ssp1 rcp2 6 was not selected as the temperature rise of gcm simulations will not reach 3 0 c above pre industrial levels at the end of 21st century all gcm simulations were extracted from the ensemble run of r1i1p1f1 except for the simulations of cnrm cm6 1 which were extracted from the ensemble run of r1i1p1f2 since gcm simulations and observations from various sources are of different spatial resolution they were interpolated to a 0 25 0 25 latitude longitude spatial resolution by the inverse distance weighting method for further analysis 2 3 global flood protection standards flood is usually defined as return periods of extreme daily streamflow events to consider flood mitigation ability of different regions the first global dataset of flood protection standards flopros developed by scussolini et al 2016 was adopted to define return periods flopros comprises three layers i e the design layer the policy layer and the model layer merged with specific priority rules to form one consistent dataset the design layer provides empirical information about the actual standards of existing protection defined by engineers the policy layer contains information about the standards from policies and regulations and the model layer includes the calculated standards through a flood modelling approach referring to jongman et al 2014 this dataset aims to provide global scale information on flood protection standards through widely collecting literature and modelling with no strict requirements on the homogeneity of different data sources for the merged dataset the design layer is deemed to be the most reliable and then the policy layer and the model layer more detailed information on this dataset can be found in scussolini et al 2016 in this dataset the flood protection standards range from 2 years to thousands of years for all watersheds in this study fig s1 the flood protection standards for north america are relatively higher about 500 years while those for south america and southeast asia are much lower mostly less than 100 years 3 methodology 3 1 definition of 1 5 3 0 c global warming periods the time sampling method is usually used to define the periods of different global warming levels referring to previous studies döll et al 2018 ji et al 2020 marx et al 2018 a reference period with known temperature rise relative to the pre industrial is required for this method since the historical simulation of cmip6 covers 1850 to 2014 the last 30 years 1985 2014 are taken as the reference period the global mean surface temperature rise of the reference period was observed as 0 66 c above pre industrial levels of 1850 1900 according to the hadcrut4 dataset morice et al 2012 therefore the 1 5 2 0 2 5 3 0 c warming periods correspond with a temperature rise of 0 84 1 34 1 84 and 2 34 c above the reference period the 30 year period with various warming levels was determined using the 30 year running mean of a multi model ensemble mme mean of global mean surface air temperature su et al 2018 vautard et al 2014 the periods with different warming levels are shown in fig 1 for two ssps for the pathway of ssp245 the 1 5 2 0 2 5 and 3 0 c warming periods are 2009 2038 2025 2054 2041 2070 and 2062 2091 respectively while for ssp585 the warming periods are defined as 2008 2037 2019 2048 2029 2058 and 2038 2067 respectively 3 2 bias correction method since gcm outputs are too biased to be used as hydrological model inputs for impact studies the bias correction method is usually applied a two stage multivariate quantile mapping tsqm method of guo et al 2019 was applied in this study the first stage of this method involves correcting the marginal distribution of precipitation and temperature by using the daily bias correction dbc method which is a univariate quantile mapping method chen et al 2013 the dbc method combines the local intensity scaling loci and daily translation dt correcting the precipitation occurrence and the frequency distributions of precipitation amounts and temperatures the second stage involves introducing the spearman rank correlation structure between precipitation and temperature by using a distribution free shuffle method presented by iman and conover 1982 in this method the temperature sequence is reordered based on the inter variable correlations of the observed time series the marginal distributions of variables that have been corrected in the first stage can be exactly preserved after the second stage the bias correction method was performed to gridded gcm simulations using gridded observations as references thus downscaling is no longer necessary the corrected meteorological data was transformed from gridded data to catchment averaged data for hydrological model simulations by voronoi diagram boots et al 2009 4 hydrological models and model calibration 4 1 hydrological models four conceptual lumped hydrological models i e xaj gr4j 6 simhyd and hmets were employed to simulate the streamflow time series for each watershed these four models are recognized as flexible adaptable and fast in execution and have been successfully used in a wide range of regions qi et al 2021 smith et al 2019 wang et al 2020 in addition these hydrological models differ in the description of hydrological processes and the number of free parameters since the original version of xaj gr4j and simhyd does not consider the snowmelt and snow accumulation a snow module i e cemaneige with two free parameters was added for the usage in snow characterized watersheds valéry et al 2014 in this module precipitation is firstly separated into rainfall and snowfall and snowmelt is then calculated based on a degree day method troin et al 2016 daily precipitation and potential evaporation pet are required as model inputs pet was calculated by the oudin equation using temperatures oudin et al 2005 the xaj model is a conceptual 15 parameter rainfall runoff model constructed by zhao et al 1980 this model divides the catchment into pervious and impervious areas and considers a three layer soil moisture store to simulate actual evapotranspiration for the impervious area surface runoff consists of all effective rainfall while for the previous area surface runoff is composed of the surface subsurface and groundwater flows the channel routings are simulated by the muskingum routing scheme the runoff routes to the catchment outlet through a unit hydrograph along with the cemaneige module there are 17 parameters for the xaj model in total the gr4j model perrin et al 2003 is a conceptual rainfall runoff hydrological model with four free parameters gr4j consists of a production reservoir a routing reservoir and two unit hydrographs proposed to simulate runoff generation and routing processes based on the non linear routing reservoir the total streamflow output contains the reservoir and flow components after combining the gr4j model with the cemaneige module the gr4j 6 hydrological model consists of six parameters arsenault et al 2015 the simhyd model is a conceptual daily rainfall runoff model with nine parameters chiew et al 2002 zhang chiew 2009 which was developed on the basis of hydrolog porter mcmahon 1971 and modhydrolog chiew mcmahon 1991 in this model infiltration store infiltration capacity soil moisture level and soil wetness are the main components for runoff generation the excess rainfall is generated after the interception store is filled then the excess rainfall exceeding the infiltration capacity contributes to the infiltration excess runoff the infiltrated component is separated into the stream groundwater store and soil moisture store stream is a linear function of the soil wetness and the unit hydrograph is used for routing jones et al 2006 along with the cemaneige module there are 11 parameters for the simhyd model in total the hmets model is a conceptual daily hydrological model with 21 parameters developed by martel et al 2017 this model is constituted of several hydrological processes evapotranspiration infiltration snow accumulation melting and refreezing and flow routing the real evapotranspiration is calculated as a function of potential evapotranspiration computed using the oudin equation the snow accumulation melting and refreezing processes are calculated based on the degree day model the simulated outlet stream consists four horizontal flow components including surface delayed runoff hypodermic flow and base flow the former two items are routed through two unit hydrographs 4 2 model calibration hydrological model parameters were optimized by the shuffled complex evolution sce ua method using kge as the objective function duan et al 1992 odd or even years were used for calibration or validation to circumvent the possible nonstationarity of streamflow time series gowda et al 2012 arsenault et al 2017 when using this method to calibrate hydrological model parameters the entire time series including both odd and even years were sequentially simulated while only odd years were extracted to calculate the objective function and the even years were extracted to validate the model using corresponding observed streamflow time series as a baseline the observed precipitation maximum temperature minimum temperature and streamflow data were used as inputs for model calibration kge is proposed by gupta et al 2009 and then improved by kling et al 2012 which overcomes the mathematical limitations of nash sutcliffe efficiency nse 1 kge 1 r 1 2 α 1 2 β 1 2 where r is the pearson s linear correlation between the streamflow observations and simulations α is the ratio of standard deviation in simulations divided by the standard deviation in observations to measure the flow variability error and β is a bias term dividing the simulated daily streamflow mean by the observed streamflow mean the positive kge values were indicatives of successful model application of the hydrological model fowler et al 2018 knoben et al 2019 to ensure sufficient watersheds covering different climate regimes kge 0 for both calibration and validation periods was selected in this study in total 9045 watersheds were selected for further studies in addition the best performing model with the maximum averaged keg value for both calibration and validation periods among four hydrological models was selected for hydrological simulations for both reference period and future periods with various warming levels gu et al 2020a li et al 2022b the coefficient of determination r2 emphasizing high flows is also used to evaluate the performance of the selected best performing model in calibration and validation periods under various warming levels the simulated streamflow time series for each catchment outlet were derived from the best performing hydrological model the hydrological model inputs are climatic simulation data from 15 bias corrected gcm simulations the first year was used as the warming up period for hydrological models which was excluded for hydrological analysis 4 3 non stationary flood frequency analysis when quantifying hydrological extremes return levels magnitudes and return periods are fundamental terms in this study the annual maximum streamflow sequence maximum daily streamflow for each year was fitted to the generalized extreme value gev distribution for frequency analysis which is usually referred to as the block maxima bm method coles et al 2001 mallakpour et al 2019 the return value is calculated according to the distribution derived from the estimated parameters three parameters i e location shape and scale of the gev distribution is estimated using the maximum likelihood method the cumulative distribution function is expressed as coles et al 2001 2 g z e x p 1 ξ z μ σ ξ ξ 0 e x p e x p z μ σ ξ 0 where z is the quantile point of the maximum random variable z μ is the location parameter σ is the scale parameter and ξ is the shape parameter among these parameters μ specifies the center of the gev distribution the non stationary streamflow extremes were considered when fitting gev distribution the mann kendall trend test was used to test the non stationary trend for annual maximum streamflow sequence at the significance level of 5 kendall 1976 mann 1945 if a significant non stationarity is detected on the basis of gev analysis a linear function of time is assumed for the location parameter over each 30 year period see equation 3 in other words the time was used as a covariance for the change of location parameter when using the gev distribution the non stationarity of annual maximum streamflow was analyzed by using a package proposed by cheng et al 2014 which introduced a framework under non stationary conditions in hydrology the scale and shape parameters were kept constant for the lack of long term hydrological data 3 μ t α t μ 0 where t is the year time and α is the slope over time for 30 year periods the goodness of fit was checked by the kolmogorov smirnov ks test and the anderso darling ad test both at a 5 significance level if the null hypothesis cannot be rejected the gev distribution is regarded as adequately fitted for a catchment otherwise watersheds with null hypothesis rejected were set as missing values which were excluded in the analysis to assess the changes of future flood defense pressures in warmer climates the return periods from flopros were employed considering flood mitigation ability for different regions the return periods of the standard streamflow at the reference period were computed at different future warming levels generally not equal to the protection standard as an indicator for the changes in the flood frequency the floods with return periods corresponding to flood protection standards from the flopros dataset are referred to as design level floods for the convenience of description changes in return periods within 10 of the design level return period were considered as the unchanged layer in addition changes in magnitude and frequency of 50 year return values were also calculated 4 4 uncertainty analysis the assessment of climate change impact on hydrology subjects to multiple sources of uncertainty chegwidden et al 2019 wang et al 2020 a multivariate analysis of variance anova method was used to analyze the uncertainty contributions from ssps gcms hydrological models hm and the interactions among different sources bosshard et al 2013 three uncertainty sources compose an ensemble of 120 combinations of hydrological simulations 2 ssps 15 gcms 4 hms the overall uncertainty was quantified as the variance of the changes in the magnitude of the 50 year flood for various warming levels the overall uncertainty or called the total variance vt can be expressed as seven components as equation 4 4 v t v s v g v h v sg v sh v gh v sgh where vs is the variance contributed by ssp vg i s t h e v a r i a n c e contributed by gcm vh i s t h e v a r i a n c e contributed by hydrological models and vsg vsh vgh and vsgh are variances contributed interactions of different uncertainty sources 5 results 5 1 performance of bias correction method the performance of the tsqm bias correction method was evaluated with respect to reproducing the observed marginal distributions of precipitation and temperature and the inter variable correlations between these two variables for all gcm simulations specifically the root mean square error rmse between the simulation and the observation over all global terrestrial grid points in the world and the spearman rank correlation coefficient between precipitation and temperature were computed these two metrics were calculated for each specific month three percentiles i e 10th 50th and 99th were selected to represent the marginal distributions for precipitation and temperatures maximum and minimum the rmse is computed according to the simulated and observed percentiles for the great similarity between results of the ssp245 and ssp585 scenarios only results under the ssp245 scenario are presented in the section of results those under the ssp585 scenario are discussed in the section of discussion fig 2 shows boxplots of rmse between gcm simulations with and without bias correction and the observations for three percentiles of precipitation and temperatures for four specific months i e january april july and october generally gcms are considerably biased for precipitation maximum and minimum temperatures fig 2a while the biases can be largely reduced by using the tsqm method fig 2b as shown in the median value of rmse as well as the range over 15 gcm simulations this is particular for daily maximum temperature as the range of 10th 50th and 99th percentiles over all gcm simulations are reduced from 2 2 to 8 5 c to 0 01 0 1 c overall the distributions of gcm simulated daily precipitation maximum and minimum temperature are generally mapped onto those of observed counterparts in addition after bias correction climate model outputs can better reproduce the correlations between three variables in observations taking january and july as examples figs s2 s5 5 2 changes in precipitation the changes of precipitation in various warming levels were demonstrated by using two indices the maximum one day precipitation rx1day and the annual total wet day precipitation prcptot these indices were calculated based on the wet day precipitation series a subset of the precipitation series from bias corrected gcm simulations in this study precipitation that exceeds a specific threshold 1 mm d is defined as wet day precipitation fig 3 shows the projected changes of prcptot and rx1day for 1 5 2 0 2 5 and 3 0 c warming periods under the ssp245 scenario relative to the reference period generally the increasing trends in prcptot are mainly located in mid high latitudes of north america most regions of eurasia and africa except the mediterranean coast and southern africa this spatial pattern is generally consistent for all four warming levels and the proportion of land grids with prcptot increases remains about 88 however a noticeable amplification in the tendency of precipitation caused by the rise of temperature can be observed everywhere for example for all regions shown increases in prcptot the averaged prcptot gradually increases from 7 1 for the 1 5 c warming level to 19 8 for the 3 0 c warming level for rx1day an overall increasing trend is observed for all warming levels in almost all continents of the world however from the 1 5 c warming level to the 3 0 c warming level the proportion of land grids with increasing rx1day has only increased by up to 4 the proportion from 95 to 99 the increase of the averaged rx1day gradually rises by 8 8 from 5 3 for the 1 5 c warming level to 14 1 for the 3 0 c warming level 5 3 hydrological model efficiency the calibration and validation of four hydrological models i e xaj gr4j simhyd and hmets over 11 397 watersheds are shown in fig s6 in terms of cumulative distributions of kge values generally hydrological models perform reasonably well for most watersheds the kge value is greater than 0 5 for about 85 of watersheds at the calibration period and about 64 at the validation period the spatial distributions of kge values at the calibration period are similar among four hydrological models figs s7 s10 hydrological models generally perform better in europe and eastern north america in addition the performance of the hydrological model is somewhat regionally dependent in terms of kge values for example xaj and gr4j are more skillful than others in eastern north america and western europe gr4j is the best performing model for most watersheds in japan and australia and hmets is more skillful in south america therefore this study selected the best performing model among four models for hydrological simulations in addition since the hydrological model performs poorly for some watersheds with kge values below 0 only 9 045 out of 11 397 watersheds for all hydrological models achieving kge 0 for both calibration and validation periods were selected for further analysis the accumulative distribution of kge values for all 9 045 watersheds is shown in fig 4 daily kge values of best performing models in calibration and validation periods are presented in fig s11 for all 9 045 watersheds the best performing hydrological model among four models is selected and shown for each catchment in fig s12 there are 2776 2544 2039 and 1686 watersheds show best performance for xaj gr4j simhyd and hmets respectively with the selection of best performing hydrological model there are 97 of 9 045 watersheds showing kge values more than 0 5 at the calibration period and 88 watersheds at the validation period the selected best performing model is further evaluated using r2 as an evaluation metric fig s13 the results show that the r2 is greater than 0 5 for about 70 watersheds further indicating the well calibrated hydrological models 6 flood in warmer climates 6 1 changes in annual maximum streamflow fig 5 shows the mme median changes of annual maximum streamflow for 1 5 2 0 2 5 and 3 0 c warming levels under the ssp245 scenario the increasing trends of annual maximum streamflow are distributed for all continents over four warming periods especially for western north america africa southeast eurasia and australia the decreases are mainly detected in coastal areas of mid latitude north america and east europe both the proportion of watersheds with positive trends and the magnitude of projected changes in annual maximum streamflow increase along with the warming levels from 1 5 to 3 0 c relative to the reference period approximately 89 of watersheds show increases in annual maximum streamflow for the 1 5 c warming period and reaching 95 for the 3 0 c warming period in western north america the averaged increase in annual maximum streamflow for watersheds with positive trends is about 51 for the 1 5 c warming period and rise to 96 for the 3 0 c warming period 7 changes in 50 year flood 7 1 changes in magnitudes of the 50 year flood fig 6 illustrates the mme median changes in magnitudes of the 50 year flood for 1 5 2 0 2 5 and 3 0 c warming periods under the ssp245 scenario relative to the reference period with the increase in warming levels the increase in magnitudes of the 50 year flood is observed for more number of watersheds in the world specifically approximately 52 of watersheds show an increase in the 50 year flood for the 1 5 c warming period and about 81 for the 3 0 c warming period moreover the amplification effect of higher air temperature is demonstrated for both increasing and decreasing trends in magnitudes of the 50 year flood with a higher level of warming the flood magnitude is projected to increase to a larger extent among watersheds with positive trends the absolute decreasing percentage of average return values also rises for regions where the flood magnitude is projected to decrease the magnitudes of the 50 year flood are projected to increase 1 4 4 3 10 6 and 15 9 for the 1 5 2 0 2 5 and 3 0 c warming periods on global average at the 1 5 c warming level the regionally averaged 50 year return values are projected to increase by 11 6 14 1 and 7 6 for areas with positive trends in southeast eurasia africa and south america respectively till the 3 0 c warming level these percentages are projected to increase by 25 6 30 6 and 16 4 respectively in addition from 1 5 to 3 0 c warmer climate except for western north america and africa all other regions show larger percentages of decreasing change especially for western europe the regionally averaged decreasing percentage of the 50 year return values reduces from 9 for the 1 5 c warming level to 21 for the 3 0 c warming level 7 2 change in 50 year flood frequency fig 7 presents the spatial distributions of the changes in mme median return period of the 50 year flood for 1 5 2 0 2 5 and 3 0 c warming periods under ssp245 relative to the reference period the results show that the coverage of the watersheds with increasing frequency of 50 year flood expands with higher temperatures specifically the frequency is projected to increase for 46 56 70 and 78 of watersheds worldwide for the 1 5 c 2 0 2 5 and 3 0 c warming periods this is especially true for southeast eurasia africa and south america which are hotspots of increasing frequency of occurrence as 94 83 and 84 of watersheds are projected to increase in the frequency of 50 year flood for the 3 0 c warming the increase in the changing extent of 50 year flood frequency is also projected as the median return periods across global watersheds are projected to be 48 year 41 year 30 year and 23 year for the 1 5 2 0 2 5 and 3 0 warming periods respectively specifically for the 1 5 c warming period the reference level 50 year flood is projected to occur every 15 30 years for 28 16 and 19 watersheds in southeast eurasia africa and south america respectively these percentages rise to 47 38 and 51 for the 3 0 c warming period in contrast flood frequency decreases in many north america and western europe regions 7 3 changes in the design level flood frequency linking to flood protection standards fig s14 shows the spatial distribution of the mme median return period of the design level floods for the reference period in 1 5 2 0 2 5 and 3 0 c warming periods under ssp245 generally the projections of design level flood frequency for four warming periods show similar spatial distributions to those of the 50 year flood frequency in fig 7 the spatial pattern is similar for various warming levels even though the change extent is not the same specifically 47 of watersheds would face more significant flood defense pressure at the 1 5 c warming level in comparison this proportion is projected to reach 55 at the 2 0 c warming level 70 at the 2 5 c warming level and 74 at the warming of 3 0 c to consider the discrepancies among different regions and recognize the hotspot of changes eight districts are divided according to the location of selected watersheds fig 8 displays the projected proportions of watersheds with increasing and decreasing trends in the return period of design level floods for each district generally the proportion of watersheds with decreases in return periods is larger than that with an increase in return period especially for southeast eurasia africa and south america specifically at the 1 5 c warming level more frequent design level flood is likely to occur for 40 of watersheds in africa 40 of watersheds in south america and 60 of watersheds in southeast eurasia when the temperature rise reaches 3 0 c the frequency of design level flood increases is projected for about 87 85 and 92 of watersheds in africa south america and southeast eurasia respectively in contrast the proportions of watersheds with an increase in the frequency of design level floods are relatively small for north america and western europe 7 4 uncertainty analysis the overall uncertainty of the changes in floods is investigated in terms of variance since similar results are observed for various flood characteristics only the uncertainty of the changes in magnitudes of the 50 year flood is shown in fig 9 for demonstration the results show that uncertainty of changes in magnitudes of the 50 year flood is relatively small in eastern north america europe northwestern south america and southeast coast of asia in contrast it is greater in central north america and northeastern south america with a higher level of warming there is larger uncertainty as the higher level of warming means a farther future period the median variances among all watersheds are projected to be 5 7 7 6 8 9 and 9 8 2 for the 1 5 2 0 2 5 and 3 0 c warming periods respectively based on the anova method the overall uncertainty was decomposed to uncertainty components of different sources and fig 10 shows the uncertainty contributions from gcm hm ssp and the interaction of different sources to the changes in the magnitude of 50 year flood for 1 5 2 0 2 5 and 3 0 c warming periods in boxplots each boxplot consists of all watersheds the spatial distribution of uncertainty contributions is shown in fig s15 all interactions are summed up in this figure the proportion of watersheds with significant uncertainty contributions at the p 0 05 level was also calculated and presented in fig s16 generally the spatial pattern of uncertainty contributions is similar for all four warming periods the contributions from the seven sources are very different in general gcm and the interaction of different sources are dominant components for overall uncertainty for the changes in magnitudes of the 50 year flood specifically gcm is the major contributor for eastern north america central and eastern coastal south america northwestern europe and southeast eurasia the interaction of different sources contributes more uncertainty for central north america northeastern south america southeastern europe southern south africa and australia than other regions moreover the share of uncertainty from gcm and the interaction of different sources would change slightly with a temperature rising for the change in magnitudes of 50 year flood for all warming periods the overall uncertainty is tightly associated with the choice of a gcm which explains about 42 41 43 from 1 5 to 3 0 c warming of the overall uncertainty in particular the uncertainty is significant at the p 0 05 level for almost all watersheds in addition the contribution of the interaction of different sources is all high in total the interactions explain about 49 48 52 of the overall uncertainty however the uncertainty contribution of the interaction is tightly related to gcms specifically contributions of interactions between gcm and ssp and those between gcm and hm are around 20 respectively with the latter is slightly larger while the uncertainty is significant for more than 70 of watersheds in addition the contribution of interaction from three sources gcm ssp and hm is also important in contrast ssp only contributes a small share about 1 of uncertainty irrespective of the warming level even though there are still a large number of watersheds with significant contributions since 1 5 2 0 2 5 and 3 0 c warming periods for different ssp scenarios are defined according to their respective temperature rise trajectory this is also proved in the spatial distribution of uncertainty contributions in fig s15 hm contributes about 8 6 9 of uncertainty for the changes in magnitudes of the 50 year flood which is relatively higher in coastal areas of north america at mid high latitudes eastern europe and northeast eurasia compared with other regions 8 discussions to understand the response of hydrological extremes floods in this study to global warming the impacts of various warming levels from 1 5 c to 3 0 c on floods were investigated over 9 045 watersheds in the world to better explain the changes in flood characteristics the intensification of total and extreme precipitation and the changes of the annual maximum streamflow with rising temperature were first investigated in general the spatial pattern and the changing extent of flood characteristics are consistent with that of the short duration extreme precipitation and annual maximum streamflow the watersheds with high increases in the 50 year flood frequency are mainly located in regions with relatively high increases in rx1day positive trends dominate the annual maximum streamflow across most watersheds for all continents while negative trends only emerge in quite limited regions that are consistent with those of the 50 year flood frequency unlike the spatially homogeneous changes projected in other regions the changes of the flood characteristics show less spatial continuity in western europe and north america similar results were also found in the other studies e g arnell gosling 2016 hirabayashi et al 2013 liu et al 2021 roudier et al 2016 this is as expected since the flood generation mechanism are more complicated than precipitation which can be classified as rainfall dominated snowmelt dominated rainfall snowmelt mixed vormoor et al 2015 huo et al 2022 for rainfall dominated watersheds the rainfall becomes more dominant where it has already been dominant as such the flood can be intensified however for snowmelt dominated watersheds the increases in winter temperatures may lead to decreases in the frequency and magnitude of snowmelt generated events due to less snow accumulation in the winter and shorter snow seasons vormoor et al 2015 in addition the increase of temperature can also change the flood seasonality leading to a shift in the current flood regimes which is especially true for watersheds with rainfall snowmelt mixed flood generation process the reason for opposite trends of changes in floods in adjacent watersheds is probably that the flood generation for a watershed is dependent not only on climate conditions but also on watershed characteristics the influencing factors were explained by soil moisture and evapotranspiration characteristics of watersheds associated the decreasing flood magnitude in most south american rivers with the decreases in soil moisture and increases in evapotranspiration with the warming from 1 5 to 2 0 c liu et al 2021 the soil moisture excess is also defined as one of the most important flood generation mechanism besides extreme rainfall flood and snowmelt flood berghuijs et al 2016 berghuijs et al 2019 floods caused by the daily soil moisture excess event can be defined as the sum of daily precipitation eliminated the evapotranspiration minus the unsaturated soil moisture storage capacity if soil moisture is saturated the occurrence of a moderate precipitation event may lead to a large flood event and vice versa furthermore the influencing factors can also be complex topographic and land cover spatial variations according to some regional studies e g degefu et al 2019 that found statistically significant opposite trends of high flow indicators in adjacent gauging stations within the same or adjacent river basin for a large number of watersheds it is really hard to distinguish flood generation mechanism one by one but the identification of the change of flood generation mechanism can be an avenue for future studies to confirm the stability of the flood characteristics under different greenhouse gas emission scenarios in addition to the ssp245 scenario the change of flood characteristics under the ssp585 scenario was also investigated figs s17 s22 theoretically there should be little difference between two scenarios since the same warming levels were used according to their respective temperature rise trajectory in other words different time periods were selected for two scenarios in order to define each specific warming level overall the changes in all indicators with global warming under ssp585 are projected to follow a similar spatial pattern to those under ssp245 however slight differences between the two scenarios might originate from the uncertainty resulting from calculations and the methods for selecting the specific periods specifically the differences in the proportions of watersheds showing increases in indicators like prcptot rx1day and annual maximum streamflow between two scenarios are within 1 for all warming periods the proportion of watersheds showing increasing frequency in the 50 year flood is slightly smaller within 5 under ssp585 than those under ssp245 the changing extents averaged among watersheds with increasing indicators like prcptot and rx1day are slightly larger within 1 1 under ssp585 than those under ssp245 for all warming periods the above results further prove the robust results in this study similar results were also obtained in previous studies gu et al 2020b shi et al 2021 although the indices of extreme precipitation for the sahara desert and the western coastal areas of the mid latitude southern hemisphere show great increases compared with the reference period these areas cannot be regarded as hotspots of changes because these are hyper arid or arid areas lian et al 2021 which means a small absolute change corresponding to a large percentage change various uncertainty sources have been clearly identified in climate change impact studies on hydrology chen et al 2011 they include uncertainty from greenhouse gas emissions scenarios ggess gcm structures and parameters internal climate variability downscaling bias correction methods and hydrological models structure and parameters wilby and harris 2006 chen et al 2011 since the choice of gcms and hydrological models were considered as the major two uncertainty sources especially for the former wilby and harris 2006 zhang et al 2022 these two and their interaction were quantified in this study due to a heavy computation burden for global studies even though the uncertainty related to ggess was also considered but it is not important in this study since the same warming level with different time periods were selected this study also indicates that the choice of gcms is the dominated uncertainty contributor this is expected and consistent with previous studies due to limitations of knowledge of physical processes in the real climate system and imperfect implementation of the existing knowledge to cgms which results in various model structures and model parameterization therefore different gcms provide various climate projections the results also indicates that gcms and other sources interact with each other for example the interaction between gcms and hydrological models contribution about 20 of the total uncertainty this means some combinations of different gcms and hydrological models perform better than others indicating the performance of gcms and hydrological models may not be consistent between historical and future periods because of the complicated interactions the similarly performed gcms may not perform similarly after hydrological modeling for the same reason the best calibrated hydrological model may not always lead to the best hydrological projection this further indicates that the quantification of interaction uncertainty caused by interactions among different sources is important for understanding the overall uncertainty of climate change impacts on hydrology but then again overall uncertainty and the relative contribution of each uncertainty source is deserved to be further investigated in future studies this study only investigated the climate change impacts on the flood while other anthropogenic factors were not considered for the flood simulation for example human activities such as reservoir operations land use and land cover changes and new dam constructions may alter the flood regimes wen et al 2021 li et al 2022a li et al 2022b as a global study taking into account the impacts of human activities on the change of flood characteristics is a big challenge this is especially true for this study when using lumped hydrological models for hydrological simulations however human activities are partly generalized by parameters of lumped hydrological models since they are well calibrated thus the use of well calibrated lumped hydrological models can partly offset the advantages of using distributed hydrological models with a consideration of human activities in addition this study only investigated the changes of flood regimes and their implication to current flood defense standards in various warming periods future studies can further analyzed the exposures of population and economy in the flooded area to achieve this the gridded streamflow time series simulated by global climate models can be input to hydrodynamic models such as the cama flood model yamazaki et al 2011 to delineate the inundated areas of certain recurrence frequency future flood risks can be projected more specifically by employing demographic and economic data development trajectories in this way the impacts of unnatural factors on global warming and the socioeconomic flood exposures in response to global warming could be associated which helps make strategies for flood mitigations however the lumped hydrological models were used for outlet hydrological simulations in this study the point flood events cannot map the gridded demographic and economic data therefore further analysis on the exposures of population and economy in the flooded area deserves more effort in future studies 9 conclusions this study assesses the responses of river floods to 1 5 2 0 2 5 and 3 0 c warming climates above pre industrial levels from a global perspective and their implication to the current flood protection standards specifically four well calibrated lumped hydrological models i e xaj gr4j simhyd and hmets are used to simulate the daily streamflow time series using 15 bias corrected climate model simulations under two ssp scenarios from the cmip6 achieve the frequency and magnitude of the design level flood defined by the flopros dataset and the 50 year flood are quantified employing the flood return period and return value as indices the reference period 1985 2014 is defined as a baseline to calculate the changes for various warming periods the following main conclusions can be drawn 1 the intensification of the absolute changes of rcptot and rx1day are accompanied by the increase of warming levels in the future prcptot would increase in mid high latitudes of north america most regions of eurasia and africa except the mediterranean coast and southern africa with climate warming while rx1day would increase throughout continents irrespective of the warming level for the 3 0 c warming level under the ssp245 scenario the averaged prcptot is projected to increase by about 19 8 among 88 land grid and the averaged rx1day is projected to increase by 14 1 for 99 land grids 2 the changes of the annual maximum streamflow follow a similar spatial pattern for four warming levels an overall increasing trend is projected for most regions especially for western north america africa southeast eurasia and australia more watersheds would show increases in the magnitude and larger extent of changes with the warming from 1 5 to 3 0 c approximately 89 and 95 of watersheds worldwide would experience the increasing annual maximum streamflow respectively for the 1 5 and 3 0 c warming periods 3 the impact of global warming on the changes of flood frequency is projected to amplify with higher air temperature the median return periods of 50 year flood across all watersheds are projected to be 48 year 41 year 30 year and 23 year for the 1 5 2 0 2 5 and 3 0 warming periods respectively for the hotspots of southeast eurasia africa and south america the reference level 50 year flood would occur every 15 30 years for 28 16 and 19 watersheds respectively at the 1 5 c warming level these proportions are projected to rise to 47 38 and 51 for the 3 0 c warming level the amplification effect of higher air temperature on the flood magnitude is also observed especially for watersheds with positive trends the globally averaged increases in 50 year flood return values are projected to be 1 4 4 3 10 6 and 15 9 for the 1 5 2 0 2 5 and 3 0 c warming periods the regionally averaged 50 year return values are projected to increase respectively by 11 6 14 1 and 7 6 for areas with positive trends in southeast eurasia africa and south america for the 1 5 c warming period and increase by 25 6 30 6 and 16 4 for the 3 0 c warming period respectively 4 for four warming periods the design level flood frequency is projected to increase for north america central and eastern coastal south america northwestern europe africa most areas of asia and australia whereas the decreasing trend is observed for mid latitude north america northeastern south america southeastern europe and southern south africa with a higher level of warming more watersheds would face more significant pressures on flood defenses as the increasing trend in design level flood frequency gradually dominates all continents under the ssp245 scenario the proportions of watersheds showing frequency increases are 47 55 70 and 74 for 1 5 2 0 2 5 and 3 0 c warming periods southeast eurasia africa and south america are detected as hotspots with higher flood defense pressures 5 the median variances of the changes in 50 year flood magnitude over all watersheds are projected to be 5 7 7 6 8 9 and 9 8 for the 1 5 2 0 2 5 and 3 0 c warming periods respectively gcm and the interaction among gcm ssp and hm are two major sources to overall uncertainty for the changes of flood characteristics specifically gcm explains approximately 42 41 43 from 1 5 to 3 0 c of the overall uncertainty and the interactions in total explain 49 48 52 ssp and hm only contribute about 1 and 8 6 9 of overall uncertainty respectively in particular the contribution of ssp and hm is uniform for all global watersheds the amplification effect of higher air temperatures on changing trends is summarized for flood related indices these results highlight the necessity for more stringent temperature constraints and adequate flood adaptation and mitigation strategies in addition more efforts should be made to improve flood protection capacity in areas such as southeast eurasia africa and south america credit authorship contribution statement jie chen conceptualization formal analysis methodology project administration supervision

2246,floods usually threaten human lives and cause serious economic losses which can be more severe with global warming therefore it is a salient challenge to find out how global flood characteristic changes and whether current flood protection standards will face more pressures this study aims to characterize changes in global floods and explicit flood defense pressures in warming climates of 1 5 3 0 c above pre industrial levels by running four well calibrated lumped hydrological models using bias corrected global climate model gcm simulations for 9045 watersheds worldwide the results show that global warming from 1 5 to 3 0 c has increasingly dominated all continents with amplification effects on changes of flood frequency and magnitude southeast eurasia africa and south america are hotspots of changes for significant proportions of watersheds with larger flood patterns and greater changing extents than others for example for the 3 0 c warming period under the combination of shared socioeconomic pathway 2 and representative concentration pathway 4 5 ssp245 scenario the regionally averaged 50 year flood magnitude will increase by 25 6 30 6 and 16 4 for these regions respectively the increases in occurrence and magnitude indicate that current flood protection standards will face increasing pressures in future warming climates the design level flood frequency is projected to increase for about 47 55 70 and 74 of watersheds in 1 5 2 0 2 5 and 3 0 c warming periods under the ssp245 scenario however large uncertainty are observed for the change of flood characteristics dominated by gcms and their interactions with ssp scenarios and hydrological models this study implies that the current flood defense standards should be enhanced and climate adaptation and mitigation strategies should be proposed to cope the change of future flood plain language summary floods usually threaten human lives and cause serious economic losses which can be more severe in the context of global warming it is a salient challenge to find out how global flood risk changes and whether current flood protection standards will face more pressures this study aims to characterize changes in global floods and explicit flood defense pressures in warming climates of 1 5 2 0 2 5 and 3 0 c above pre industrial levels here we show that amplification effects of higher air temperature on the range of changes in flood frequency and magnitude are projected southeast eurasia africa and south america are hotspots of changes for significant proportions of watersheds with larger flood patterns and greater changing extents than others most watersheds worldwide is likely to face increasing flood defense pressures in warming climates our findings could improve the understanding of future flood conditions under the warming climates and provide information to mitigation and adaptation policymaking keywords global warming global climate models floods flood protection standards data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the global air temperature has continuously increased resulting in a more dangerous world fischer knutti 2015 foster rahmstorf 2011 as warmer atmosphere increases water vapor concentration and water transport held soden 2006 wang et al 2017 the impact of global warming on the intensification process of the hydrological cycle has become an indisputable fact many studies e g hirabayashi et al 2013 musselman et al 2018 have shown that the flood risk responding to global warming often appears as an increasing pattern in both occurrence and magnitude at the regional scale which would consequently bring more disasters to the global population property and infrastructure systems bubeck et al 2019 de moel et al 2011 jevrejeva et al 2018 winsemius et al 2016 to reduce the negative impacts of global warming the paris agreement has proposed as a legally binding international treaty on climate change with the goal to hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 c above pre industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1 5 c above pre industrial levels agreement 2015 however the emissions gap report 2021 shows that the new and updated climate pledges reported by countries lag far behind what is required to achieve the paris agreement temperature constraining targets which means the world is on track for global warming of 2 7 c by the end of 21st century unep 2021 that would lead to catastrophic changes in the earth s system including the hydrological cycle therefore a good understanding of future flood conditions under the warming climate is paramount in helping governments and non governmental organizations make strategies for flood mitigations and adaptations in the past decades endeavors have been devoted to assessing the responses of flood characteristics and risks to global warming at various spatial scales from small watersheds to continental and global scales with different definitions of flood and warming periods when assessing the changes in future flood characteristics at the watershed scale watershed hydrological models are often adopted to simulate streamflow sequence for future periods many researches have concluded that flood magnitude and frequency would increase with the rising temperature for example aich et al 2014 drove the swim model to simulate runoffs for four watersheds in africa and found remarkable increases in the streamflow peaks during the rainy season for three watersheds with global warming roudier et al 2016 used an ensemble of 3 pan european hydrological models and projected an apparent increase in the magnitude of 10 and 100 year floods for most areas of europe under the warming of 2 0 c above pre industrial levels huang et al 2018 used three hydrological models i e vic swim and mhm over four large global watersheds and found that the 100 year flood magnitude is projected to increase by 13 16 in the rhine and mississippi 31 in the yellow under the 3 0 c warming level whereas decrease by about 20 in the niger from the global perspective some studies also investigated the change in flood characteristics by driving global hydrological models ghms using climate simulations under different warming levels for example asadieh and krakauer 2017 concluded that the changes in the magnitude of streamflow extremes for the more than 4 0 c warming level by the end of the 21st century are projected to be about twice as large as at the 2 0 warming level dankers et al 2014 have shown that the increases in the magnitude and frequency of the 30 year peak flows would occur at roughly two thirds of the global land areas by using nine global hydrology and land surface models alfieri et al 2017 drove the lisflood model and projected that the return period of floods would significantly decrease for the 1 5 2 0 and 4 0 c warming periods above pre industrial level compared with the reference period 1975 2005 arnell and gosling 2016 projected that current 100 year floods would occur twice at least by 2050 across 40 of the world by using the mac pdm 09 model for runoff simulations and nearly 450 million people and 430 thousand km2 cropland will be exposed to this change the population exposure under future scenarios was also investigated by other studies such as alfieri et al 2017 and hirabayashi et al 2013 in addition some studies also used gridded runoff to investigate the change of flood characteristics for example hirabayashi et al 2013 used the global grid runoff extracted from the atmosphere ocean general circulation model aogcm of the cmip5 dataset and projected that the frequency of 100 year flood for the 2071 2100 period would increase over the south and southeast asia northern eurasia south america and tropical africa compared to the 1971 2000 period even though the use of ghms or gridded runoffs can investigate the response of flood regimes to global warming for a large range of the world these models are usually not well calibrated for flood simulations alfieri et al 2017 beck et al 2016 dottori et al 2018 gosling et al 2017 in particular the use of ghm usually focuses on runoff generations at the grid scale rather than floods at watershed outlets the use of the well calibrated watershed hydrological model is usually considered to be more reliable for flood or extreme flow simulations at the watershed outlet alfieri et al 2018 krysanova et al 2018 veldkamp et al 2018 ward et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 however the use of multiple well calibrated watershed hydrological models to quantify the impacts of climate warming on global floods is still lack the use of multiple climate models and hydrological model is feasible to investigate the uncertainty of each source and their interactions moreover most of the previous studies only investigated the change of flood characteristics in a changing climate while not linking the change of flood characteristics to the current flood protection standards the link of current flood protection standards to the change of flood characteristics is the first step to be aware of the flood defense pressure which is useful to inform climate change policy and flood risk management jevrejeva et al 2018 accordingly the objectives of this study are to quantify the response of extremely high streamflow hereinafter referred to as flood to restricted 1 5 2 0 2 5 and 3 0 c warming levels above pre industrial level at the global scale and investigate their implications to current flood protection standards to obtained robust results all assessments were based on hydrological simulations from four well calibrated hydrological models over 9 045 watersheds distributed over various hydro meteorological regimes in the world the change of pressures for the current flood protection standards is assessed by using the global dataset of flood protection standards flopros developed by scussolini et al 2016 2 datasets 2 1 meteorological and hydrological observations the gridded meteorological dataset was extracted from the global precipitation climatology centre gpcc v 2018 and the climate prediction centre cpc the dataset includes the observed daily precipitation with a 1 1 spatial resolution and the daily maximum minimum temperature with a 0 5 0 5 spatial resolution in addition the observed daily streamflow dataset was derived from three sources i e the global runoff data centers grdc hydrometeorological sandbox école de technologie supérieure hysets database for north america arsenault et al 2020 and some watersheds in china gu et al 2020a to ensure parameters of hydrological models being well calibrated watersheds with streamflow time series longer than 20 years were selected the watersheds cover a wide range of climate regimes of the global surface 2 2 climate simulations daily precipitation maximum temperature and minimum temperature simulations extracted from 15 gcms provided by the coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 cmip6 https esgf node llnl gov projects cmip6 were used in this study these 15 gcms were derived from various climate centers the details are shown in table s1 these gcms were driven by historical forcing before 2015 and driven by two combinations of shared socioeconomic pathways ssps and representative concentration pathways rcps for convenience ssp245 ssp2 rcp4 5 and ssp585 ssp5 rcp8 5 were used for each gcm afterward the ssp245 scenario represents an intermediate development pathway in a moderate world while ssp585 represents a high development pathway in a world with rapid fossil fuel evolution o neill et al 2016 o neill et al 2017 riahi et al 2017 ssp126 ssp1 rcp2 6 was not selected as the temperature rise of gcm simulations will not reach 3 0 c above pre industrial levels at the end of 21st century all gcm simulations were extracted from the ensemble run of r1i1p1f1 except for the simulations of cnrm cm6 1 which were extracted from the ensemble run of r1i1p1f2 since gcm simulations and observations from various sources are of different spatial resolution they were interpolated to a 0 25 0 25 latitude longitude spatial resolution by the inverse distance weighting method for further analysis 2 3 global flood protection standards flood is usually defined as return periods of extreme daily streamflow events to consider flood mitigation ability of different regions the first global dataset of flood protection standards flopros developed by scussolini et al 2016 was adopted to define return periods flopros comprises three layers i e the design layer the policy layer and the model layer merged with specific priority rules to form one consistent dataset the design layer provides empirical information about the actual standards of existing protection defined by engineers the policy layer contains information about the standards from policies and regulations and the model layer includes the calculated standards through a flood modelling approach referring to jongman et al 2014 this dataset aims to provide global scale information on flood protection standards through widely collecting literature and modelling with no strict requirements on the homogeneity of different data sources for the merged dataset the design layer is deemed to be the most reliable and then the policy layer and the model layer more detailed information on this dataset can be found in scussolini et al 2016 in this dataset the flood protection standards range from 2 years to thousands of years for all watersheds in this study fig s1 the flood protection standards for north america are relatively higher about 500 years while those for south america and southeast asia are much lower mostly less than 100 years 3 methodology 3 1 definition of 1 5 3 0 c global warming periods the time sampling method is usually used to define the periods of different global warming levels referring to previous studies döll et al 2018 ji et al 2020 marx et al 2018 a reference period with known temperature rise relative to the pre industrial is required for this method since the historical simulation of cmip6 covers 1850 to 2014 the last 30 years 1985 2014 are taken as the reference period the global mean surface temperature rise of the reference period was observed as 0 66 c above pre industrial levels of 1850 1900 according to the hadcrut4 dataset morice et al 2012 therefore the 1 5 2 0 2 5 3 0 c warming periods correspond with a temperature rise of 0 84 1 34 1 84 and 2 34 c above the reference period the 30 year period with various warming levels was determined using the 30 year running mean of a multi model ensemble mme mean of global mean surface air temperature su et al 2018 vautard et al 2014 the periods with different warming levels are shown in fig 1 for two ssps for the pathway of ssp245 the 1 5 2 0 2 5 and 3 0 c warming periods are 2009 2038 2025 2054 2041 2070 and 2062 2091 respectively while for ssp585 the warming periods are defined as 2008 2037 2019 2048 2029 2058 and 2038 2067 respectively 3 2 bias correction method since gcm outputs are too biased to be used as hydrological model inputs for impact studies the bias correction method is usually applied a two stage multivariate quantile mapping tsqm method of guo et al 2019 was applied in this study the first stage of this method involves correcting the marginal distribution of precipitation and temperature by using the daily bias correction dbc method which is a univariate quantile mapping method chen et al 2013 the dbc method combines the local intensity scaling loci and daily translation dt correcting the precipitation occurrence and the frequency distributions of precipitation amounts and temperatures the second stage involves introducing the spearman rank correlation structure between precipitation and temperature by using a distribution free shuffle method presented by iman and conover 1982 in this method the temperature sequence is reordered based on the inter variable correlations of the observed time series the marginal distributions of variables that have been corrected in the first stage can be exactly preserved after the second stage the bias correction method was performed to gridded gcm simulations using gridded observations as references thus downscaling is no longer necessary the corrected meteorological data was transformed from gridded data to catchment averaged data for hydrological model simulations by voronoi diagram boots et al 2009 4 hydrological models and model calibration 4 1 hydrological models four conceptual lumped hydrological models i e xaj gr4j 6 simhyd and hmets were employed to simulate the streamflow time series for each watershed these four models are recognized as flexible adaptable and fast in execution and have been successfully used in a wide range of regions qi et al 2021 smith et al 2019 wang et al 2020 in addition these hydrological models differ in the description of hydrological processes and the number of free parameters since the original version of xaj gr4j and simhyd does not consider the snowmelt and snow accumulation a snow module i e cemaneige with two free parameters was added for the usage in snow characterized watersheds valéry et al 2014 in this module precipitation is firstly separated into rainfall and snowfall and snowmelt is then calculated based on a degree day method troin et al 2016 daily precipitation and potential evaporation pet are required as model inputs pet was calculated by the oudin equation using temperatures oudin et al 2005 the xaj model is a conceptual 15 parameter rainfall runoff model constructed by zhao et al 1980 this model divides the catchment into pervious and impervious areas and considers a three layer soil moisture store to simulate actual evapotranspiration for the impervious area surface runoff consists of all effective rainfall while for the previous area surface runoff is composed of the surface subsurface and groundwater flows the channel routings are simulated by the muskingum routing scheme the runoff routes to the catchment outlet through a unit hydrograph along with the cemaneige module there are 17 parameters for the xaj model in total the gr4j model perrin et al 2003 is a conceptual rainfall runoff hydrological model with four free parameters gr4j consists of a production reservoir a routing reservoir and two unit hydrographs proposed to simulate runoff generation and routing processes based on the non linear routing reservoir the total streamflow output contains the reservoir and flow components after combining the gr4j model with the cemaneige module the gr4j 6 hydrological model consists of six parameters arsenault et al 2015 the simhyd model is a conceptual daily rainfall runoff model with nine parameters chiew et al 2002 zhang chiew 2009 which was developed on the basis of hydrolog porter mcmahon 1971 and modhydrolog chiew mcmahon 1991 in this model infiltration store infiltration capacity soil moisture level and soil wetness are the main components for runoff generation the excess rainfall is generated after the interception store is filled then the excess rainfall exceeding the infiltration capacity contributes to the infiltration excess runoff the infiltrated component is separated into the stream groundwater store and soil moisture store stream is a linear function of the soil wetness and the unit hydrograph is used for routing jones et al 2006 along with the cemaneige module there are 11 parameters for the simhyd model in total the hmets model is a conceptual daily hydrological model with 21 parameters developed by martel et al 2017 this model is constituted of several hydrological processes evapotranspiration infiltration snow accumulation melting and refreezing and flow routing the real evapotranspiration is calculated as a function of potential evapotranspiration computed using the oudin equation the snow accumulation melting and refreezing processes are calculated based on the degree day model the simulated outlet stream consists four horizontal flow components including surface delayed runoff hypodermic flow and base flow the former two items are routed through two unit hydrographs 4 2 model calibration hydrological model parameters were optimized by the shuffled complex evolution sce ua method using kge as the objective function duan et al 1992 odd or even years were used for calibration or validation to circumvent the possible nonstationarity of streamflow time series gowda et al 2012 arsenault et al 2017 when using this method to calibrate hydrological model parameters the entire time series including both odd and even years were sequentially simulated while only odd years were extracted to calculate the objective function and the even years were extracted to validate the model using corresponding observed streamflow time series as a baseline the observed precipitation maximum temperature minimum temperature and streamflow data were used as inputs for model calibration kge is proposed by gupta et al 2009 and then improved by kling et al 2012 which overcomes the mathematical limitations of nash sutcliffe efficiency nse 1 kge 1 r 1 2 α 1 2 β 1 2 where r is the pearson s linear correlation between the streamflow observations and simulations α is the ratio of standard deviation in simulations divided by the standard deviation in observations to measure the flow variability error and β is a bias term dividing the simulated daily streamflow mean by the observed streamflow mean the positive kge values were indicatives of successful model application of the hydrological model fowler et al 2018 knoben et al 2019 to ensure sufficient watersheds covering different climate regimes kge 0 for both calibration and validation periods was selected in this study in total 9045 watersheds were selected for further studies in addition the best performing model with the maximum averaged keg value for both calibration and validation periods among four hydrological models was selected for hydrological simulations for both reference period and future periods with various warming levels gu et al 2020a li et al 2022b the coefficient of determination r2 emphasizing high flows is also used to evaluate the performance of the selected best performing model in calibration and validation periods under various warming levels the simulated streamflow time series for each catchment outlet were derived from the best performing hydrological model the hydrological model inputs are climatic simulation data from 15 bias corrected gcm simulations the first year was used as the warming up period for hydrological models which was excluded for hydrological analysis 4 3 non stationary flood frequency analysis when quantifying hydrological extremes return levels magnitudes and return periods are fundamental terms in this study the annual maximum streamflow sequence maximum daily streamflow for each year was fitted to the generalized extreme value gev distribution for frequency analysis which is usually referred to as the block maxima bm method coles et al 2001 mallakpour et al 2019 the return value is calculated according to the distribution derived from the estimated parameters three parameters i e location shape and scale of the gev distribution is estimated using the maximum likelihood method the cumulative distribution function is expressed as coles et al 2001 2 g z e x p 1 ξ z μ σ ξ ξ 0 e x p e x p z μ σ ξ 0 where z is the quantile point of the maximum random variable z μ is the location parameter σ is the scale parameter and ξ is the shape parameter among these parameters μ specifies the center of the gev distribution the non stationary streamflow extremes were considered when fitting gev distribution the mann kendall trend test was used to test the non stationary trend for annual maximum streamflow sequence at the significance level of 5 kendall 1976 mann 1945 if a significant non stationarity is detected on the basis of gev analysis a linear function of time is assumed for the location parameter over each 30 year period see equation 3 in other words the time was used as a covariance for the change of location parameter when using the gev distribution the non stationarity of annual maximum streamflow was analyzed by using a package proposed by cheng et al 2014 which introduced a framework under non stationary conditions in hydrology the scale and shape parameters were kept constant for the lack of long term hydrological data 3 μ t α t μ 0 where t is the year time and α is the slope over time for 30 year periods the goodness of fit was checked by the kolmogorov smirnov ks test and the anderso darling ad test both at a 5 significance level if the null hypothesis cannot be rejected the gev distribution is regarded as adequately fitted for a catchment otherwise watersheds with null hypothesis rejected were set as missing values which were excluded in the analysis to assess the changes of future flood defense pressures in warmer climates the return periods from flopros were employed considering flood mitigation ability for different regions the return periods of the standard streamflow at the reference period were computed at different future warming levels generally not equal to the protection standard as an indicator for the changes in the flood frequency the floods with return periods corresponding to flood protection standards from the flopros dataset are referred to as design level floods for the convenience of description changes in return periods within 10 of the design level return period were considered as the unchanged layer in addition changes in magnitude and frequency of 50 year return values were also calculated 4 4 uncertainty analysis the assessment of climate change impact on hydrology subjects to multiple sources of uncertainty chegwidden et al 2019 wang et al 2020 a multivariate analysis of variance anova method was used to analyze the uncertainty contributions from ssps gcms hydrological models hm and the interactions among different sources bosshard et al 2013 three uncertainty sources compose an ensemble of 120 combinations of hydrological simulations 2 ssps 15 gcms 4 hms the overall uncertainty was quantified as the variance of the changes in the magnitude of the 50 year flood for various warming levels the overall uncertainty or called the total variance vt can be expressed as seven components as equation 4 4 v t v s v g v h v sg v sh v gh v sgh where vs is the variance contributed by ssp vg i s t h e v a r i a n c e contributed by gcm vh i s t h e v a r i a n c e contributed by hydrological models and vsg vsh vgh and vsgh are variances contributed interactions of different uncertainty sources 5 results 5 1 performance of bias correction method the performance of the tsqm bias correction method was evaluated with respect to reproducing the observed marginal distributions of precipitation and temperature and the inter variable correlations between these two variables for all gcm simulations specifically the root mean square error rmse between the simulation and the observation over all global terrestrial grid points in the world and the spearman rank correlation coefficient between precipitation and temperature were computed these two metrics were calculated for each specific month three percentiles i e 10th 50th and 99th were selected to represent the marginal distributions for precipitation and temperatures maximum and minimum the rmse is computed according to the simulated and observed percentiles for the great similarity between results of the ssp245 and ssp585 scenarios only results under the ssp245 scenario are presented in the section of results those under the ssp585 scenario are discussed in the section of discussion fig 2 shows boxplots of rmse between gcm simulations with and without bias correction and the observations for three percentiles of precipitation and temperatures for four specific months i e january april july and october generally gcms are considerably biased for precipitation maximum and minimum temperatures fig 2a while the biases can be largely reduced by using the tsqm method fig 2b as shown in the median value of rmse as well as the range over 15 gcm simulations this is particular for daily maximum temperature as the range of 10th 50th and 99th percentiles over all gcm simulations are reduced from 2 2 to 8 5 c to 0 01 0 1 c overall the distributions of gcm simulated daily precipitation maximum and minimum temperature are generally mapped onto those of observed counterparts in addition after bias correction climate model outputs can better reproduce the correlations between three variables in observations taking january and july as examples figs s2 s5 5 2 changes in precipitation the changes of precipitation in various warming levels were demonstrated by using two indices the maximum one day precipitation rx1day and the annual total wet day precipitation prcptot these indices were calculated based on the wet day precipitation series a subset of the precipitation series from bias corrected gcm simulations in this study precipitation that exceeds a specific threshold 1 mm d is defined as wet day precipitation fig 3 shows the projected changes of prcptot and rx1day for 1 5 2 0 2 5 and 3 0 c warming periods under the ssp245 scenario relative to the reference period generally the increasing trends in prcptot are mainly located in mid high latitudes of north america most regions of eurasia and africa except the mediterranean coast and southern africa this spatial pattern is generally consistent for all four warming levels and the proportion of land grids with prcptot increases remains about 88 however a noticeable amplification in the tendency of precipitation caused by the rise of temperature can be observed everywhere for example for all regions shown increases in prcptot the averaged prcptot gradually increases from 7 1 for the 1 5 c warming level to 19 8 for the 3 0 c warming level for rx1day an overall increasing trend is observed for all warming levels in almost all continents of the world however from the 1 5 c warming level to the 3 0 c warming level the proportion of land grids with increasing rx1day has only increased by up to 4 the proportion from 95 to 99 the increase of the averaged rx1day gradually rises by 8 8 from 5 3 for the 1 5 c warming level to 14 1 for the 3 0 c warming level 5 3 hydrological model efficiency the calibration and validation of four hydrological models i e xaj gr4j simhyd and hmets over 11 397 watersheds are shown in fig s6 in terms of cumulative distributions of kge values generally hydrological models perform reasonably well for most watersheds the kge value is greater than 0 5 for about 85 of watersheds at the calibration period and about 64 at the validation period the spatial distributions of kge values at the calibration period are similar among four hydrological models figs s7 s10 hydrological models generally perform better in europe and eastern north america in addition the performance of the hydrological model is somewhat regionally dependent in terms of kge values for example xaj and gr4j are more skillful than others in eastern north america and western europe gr4j is the best performing model for most watersheds in japan and australia and hmets is more skillful in south america therefore this study selected the best performing model among four models for hydrological simulations in addition since the hydrological model performs poorly for some watersheds with kge values below 0 only 9 045 out of 11 397 watersheds for all hydrological models achieving kge 0 for both calibration and validation periods were selected for further analysis the accumulative distribution of kge values for all 9 045 watersheds is shown in fig 4 daily kge values of best performing models in calibration and validation periods are presented in fig s11 for all 9 045 watersheds the best performing hydrological model among four models is selected and shown for each catchment in fig s12 there are 2776 2544 2039 and 1686 watersheds show best performance for xaj gr4j simhyd and hmets respectively with the selection of best performing hydrological model there are 97 of 9 045 watersheds showing kge values more than 0 5 at the calibration period and 88 watersheds at the validation period the selected best performing model is further evaluated using r2 as an evaluation metric fig s13 the results show that the r2 is greater than 0 5 for about 70 watersheds further indicating the well calibrated hydrological models 6 flood in warmer climates 6 1 changes in annual maximum streamflow fig 5 shows the mme median changes of annual maximum streamflow for 1 5 2 0 2 5 and 3 0 c warming levels under the ssp245 scenario the increasing trends of annual maximum streamflow are distributed for all continents over four warming periods especially for western north america africa southeast eurasia and australia the decreases are mainly detected in coastal areas of mid latitude north america and east europe both the proportion of watersheds with positive trends and the magnitude of projected changes in annual maximum streamflow increase along with the warming levels from 1 5 to 3 0 c relative to the reference period approximately 89 of watersheds show increases in annual maximum streamflow for the 1 5 c warming period and reaching 95 for the 3 0 c warming period in western north america the averaged increase in annual maximum streamflow for watersheds with positive trends is about 51 for the 1 5 c warming period and rise to 96 for the 3 0 c warming period 7 changes in 50 year flood 7 1 changes in magnitudes of the 50 year flood fig 6 illustrates the mme median changes in magnitudes of the 50 year flood for 1 5 2 0 2 5 and 3 0 c warming periods under the ssp245 scenario relative to the reference period with the increase in warming levels the increase in magnitudes of the 50 year flood is observed for more number of watersheds in the world specifically approximately 52 of watersheds show an increase in the 50 year flood for the 1 5 c warming period and about 81 for the 3 0 c warming period moreover the amplification effect of higher air temperature is demonstrated for both increasing and decreasing trends in magnitudes of the 50 year flood with a higher level of warming the flood magnitude is projected to increase to a larger extent among watersheds with positive trends the absolute decreasing percentage of average return values also rises for regions where the flood magnitude is projected to decrease the magnitudes of the 50 year flood are projected to increase 1 4 4 3 10 6 and 15 9 for the 1 5 2 0 2 5 and 3 0 c warming periods on global average at the 1 5 c warming level the regionally averaged 50 year return values are projected to increase by 11 6 14 1 and 7 6 for areas with positive trends in southeast eurasia africa and south america respectively till the 3 0 c warming level these percentages are projected to increase by 25 6 30 6 and 16 4 respectively in addition from 1 5 to 3 0 c warmer climate except for western north america and africa all other regions show larger percentages of decreasing change especially for western europe the regionally averaged decreasing percentage of the 50 year return values reduces from 9 for the 1 5 c warming level to 21 for the 3 0 c warming level 7 2 change in 50 year flood frequency fig 7 presents the spatial distributions of the changes in mme median return period of the 50 year flood for 1 5 2 0 2 5 and 3 0 c warming periods under ssp245 relative to the reference period the results show that the coverage of the watersheds with increasing frequency of 50 year flood expands with higher temperatures specifically the frequency is projected to increase for 46 56 70 and 78 of watersheds worldwide for the 1 5 c 2 0 2 5 and 3 0 c warming periods this is especially true for southeast eurasia africa and south america which are hotspots of increasing frequency of occurrence as 94 83 and 84 of watersheds are projected to increase in the frequency of 50 year flood for the 3 0 c warming the increase in the changing extent of 50 year flood frequency is also projected as the median return periods across global watersheds are projected to be 48 year 41 year 30 year and 23 year for the 1 5 2 0 2 5 and 3 0 warming periods respectively specifically for the 1 5 c warming period the reference level 50 year flood is projected to occur every 15 30 years for 28 16 and 19 watersheds in southeast eurasia africa and south america respectively these percentages rise to 47 38 and 51 for the 3 0 c warming period in contrast flood frequency decreases in many north america and western europe regions 7 3 changes in the design level flood frequency linking to flood protection standards fig s14 shows the spatial distribution of the mme median return period of the design level floods for the reference period in 1 5 2 0 2 5 and 3 0 c warming periods under ssp245 generally the projections of design level flood frequency for four warming periods show similar spatial distributions to those of the 50 year flood frequency in fig 7 the spatial pattern is similar for various warming levels even though the change extent is not the same specifically 47 of watersheds would face more significant flood defense pressure at the 1 5 c warming level in comparison this proportion is projected to reach 55 at the 2 0 c warming level 70 at the 2 5 c warming level and 74 at the warming of 3 0 c to consider the discrepancies among different regions and recognize the hotspot of changes eight districts are divided according to the location of selected watersheds fig 8 displays the projected proportions of watersheds with increasing and decreasing trends in the return period of design level floods for each district generally the proportion of watersheds with decreases in return periods is larger than that with an increase in return period especially for southeast eurasia africa and south america specifically at the 1 5 c warming level more frequent design level flood is likely to occur for 40 of watersheds in africa 40 of watersheds in south america and 60 of watersheds in southeast eurasia when the temperature rise reaches 3 0 c the frequency of design level flood increases is projected for about 87 85 and 92 of watersheds in africa south america and southeast eurasia respectively in contrast the proportions of watersheds with an increase in the frequency of design level floods are relatively small for north america and western europe 7 4 uncertainty analysis the overall uncertainty of the changes in floods is investigated in terms of variance since similar results are observed for various flood characteristics only the uncertainty of the changes in magnitudes of the 50 year flood is shown in fig 9 for demonstration the results show that uncertainty of changes in magnitudes of the 50 year flood is relatively small in eastern north america europe northwestern south america and southeast coast of asia in contrast it is greater in central north america and northeastern south america with a higher level of warming there is larger uncertainty as the higher level of warming means a farther future period the median variances among all watersheds are projected to be 5 7 7 6 8 9 and 9 8 2 for the 1 5 2 0 2 5 and 3 0 c warming periods respectively based on the anova method the overall uncertainty was decomposed to uncertainty components of different sources and fig 10 shows the uncertainty contributions from gcm hm ssp and the interaction of different sources to the changes in the magnitude of 50 year flood for 1 5 2 0 2 5 and 3 0 c warming periods in boxplots each boxplot consists of all watersheds the spatial distribution of uncertainty contributions is shown in fig s15 all interactions are summed up in this figure the proportion of watersheds with significant uncertainty contributions at the p 0 05 level was also calculated and presented in fig s16 generally the spatial pattern of uncertainty contributions is similar for all four warming periods the contributions from the seven sources are very different in general gcm and the interaction of different sources are dominant components for overall uncertainty for the changes in magnitudes of the 50 year flood specifically gcm is the major contributor for eastern north america central and eastern coastal south america northwestern europe and southeast eurasia the interaction of different sources contributes more uncertainty for central north america northeastern south america southeastern europe southern south africa and australia than other regions moreover the share of uncertainty from gcm and the interaction of different sources would change slightly with a temperature rising for the change in magnitudes of 50 year flood for all warming periods the overall uncertainty is tightly associated with the choice of a gcm which explains about 42 41 43 from 1 5 to 3 0 c warming of the overall uncertainty in particular the uncertainty is significant at the p 0 05 level for almost all watersheds in addition the contribution of the interaction of different sources is all high in total the interactions explain about 49 48 52 of the overall uncertainty however the uncertainty contribution of the interaction is tightly related to gcms specifically contributions of interactions between gcm and ssp and those between gcm and hm are around 20 respectively with the latter is slightly larger while the uncertainty is significant for more than 70 of watersheds in addition the contribution of interaction from three sources gcm ssp and hm is also important in contrast ssp only contributes a small share about 1 of uncertainty irrespective of the warming level even though there are still a large number of watersheds with significant contributions since 1 5 2 0 2 5 and 3 0 c warming periods for different ssp scenarios are defined according to their respective temperature rise trajectory this is also proved in the spatial distribution of uncertainty contributions in fig s15 hm contributes about 8 6 9 of uncertainty for the changes in magnitudes of the 50 year flood which is relatively higher in coastal areas of north america at mid high latitudes eastern europe and northeast eurasia compared with other regions 8 discussions to understand the response of hydrological extremes floods in this study to global warming the impacts of various warming levels from 1 5 c to 3 0 c on floods were investigated over 9 045 watersheds in the world to better explain the changes in flood characteristics the intensification of total and extreme precipitation and the changes of the annual maximum streamflow with rising temperature were first investigated in general the spatial pattern and the changing extent of flood characteristics are consistent with that of the short duration extreme precipitation and annual maximum streamflow the watersheds with high increases in the 50 year flood frequency are mainly located in regions with relatively high increases in rx1day positive trends dominate the annual maximum streamflow across most watersheds for all continents while negative trends only emerge in quite limited regions that are consistent with those of the 50 year flood frequency unlike the spatially homogeneous changes projected in other regions the changes of the flood characteristics show less spatial continuity in western europe and north america similar results were also found in the other studies e g arnell gosling 2016 hirabayashi et al 2013 liu et al 2021 roudier et al 2016 this is as expected since the flood generation mechanism are more complicated than precipitation which can be classified as rainfall dominated snowmelt dominated rainfall snowmelt mixed vormoor et al 2015 huo et al 2022 for rainfall dominated watersheds the rainfall becomes more dominant where it has already been dominant as such the flood can be intensified however for snowmelt dominated watersheds the increases in winter temperatures may lead to decreases in the frequency and magnitude of snowmelt generated events due to less snow accumulation in the winter and shorter snow seasons vormoor et al 2015 in addition the increase of temperature can also change the flood seasonality leading to a shift in the current flood regimes which is especially true for watersheds with rainfall snowmelt mixed flood generation process the reason for opposite trends of changes in floods in adjacent watersheds is probably that the flood generation for a watershed is dependent not only on climate conditions but also on watershed characteristics the influencing factors were explained by soil moisture and evapotranspiration characteristics of watersheds associated the decreasing flood magnitude in most south american rivers with the decreases in soil moisture and increases in evapotranspiration with the warming from 1 5 to 2 0 c liu et al 2021 the soil moisture excess is also defined as one of the most important flood generation mechanism besides extreme rainfall flood and snowmelt flood berghuijs et al 2016 berghuijs et al 2019 floods caused by the daily soil moisture excess event can be defined as the sum of daily precipitation eliminated the evapotranspiration minus the unsaturated soil moisture storage capacity if soil moisture is saturated the occurrence of a moderate precipitation event may lead to a large flood event and vice versa furthermore the influencing factors can also be complex topographic and land cover spatial variations according to some regional studies e g degefu et al 2019 that found statistically significant opposite trends of high flow indicators in adjacent gauging stations within the same or adjacent river basin for a large number of watersheds it is really hard to distinguish flood generation mechanism one by one but the identification of the change of flood generation mechanism can be an avenue for future studies to confirm the stability of the flood characteristics under different greenhouse gas emission scenarios in addition to the ssp245 scenario the change of flood characteristics under the ssp585 scenario was also investigated figs s17 s22 theoretically there should be little difference between two scenarios since the same warming levels were used according to their respective temperature rise trajectory in other words different time periods were selected for two scenarios in order to define each specific warming level overall the changes in all indicators with global warming under ssp585 are projected to follow a similar spatial pattern to those under ssp245 however slight differences between the two scenarios might originate from the uncertainty resulting from calculations and the methods for selecting the specific periods specifically the differences in the proportions of watersheds showing increases in indicators like prcptot rx1day and annual maximum streamflow between two scenarios are within 1 for all warming periods the proportion of watersheds showing increasing frequency in the 50 year flood is slightly smaller within 5 under ssp585 than those under ssp245 the changing extents averaged among watersheds with increasing indicators like prcptot and rx1day are slightly larger within 1 1 under ssp585 than those under ssp245 for all warming periods the above results further prove the robust results in this study similar results were also obtained in previous studies gu et al 2020b shi et al 2021 although the indices of extreme precipitation for the sahara desert and the western coastal areas of the mid latitude southern hemisphere show great increases compared with the reference period these areas cannot be regarded as hotspots of changes because these are hyper arid or arid areas lian et al 2021 which means a small absolute change corresponding to a large percentage change various uncertainty sources have been clearly identified in climate change impact studies on hydrology chen et al 2011 they include uncertainty from greenhouse gas emissions scenarios ggess gcm structures and parameters internal climate variability downscaling bias correction methods and hydrological models structure and parameters wilby and harris 2006 chen et al 2011 since the choice of gcms and hydrological models were considered as the major two uncertainty sources especially for the former wilby and harris 2006 zhang et al 2022 these two and their interaction were quantified in this study due to a heavy computation burden for global studies even though the uncertainty related to ggess was also considered but it is not important in this study since the same warming level with different time periods were selected this study also indicates that the choice of gcms is the dominated uncertainty contributor this is expected and consistent with previous studies due to limitations of knowledge of physical processes in the real climate system and imperfect implementation of the existing knowledge to cgms which results in various model structures and model parameterization therefore different gcms provide various climate projections the results also indicates that gcms and other sources interact with each other for example the interaction between gcms and hydrological models contribution about 20 of the total uncertainty this means some combinations of different gcms and hydrological models perform better than others indicating the performance of gcms and hydrological models may not be consistent between historical and future periods because of the complicated interactions the similarly performed gcms may not perform similarly after hydrological modeling for the same reason the best calibrated hydrological model may not always lead to the best hydrological projection this further indicates that the quantification of interaction uncertainty caused by interactions among different sources is important for understanding the overall uncertainty of climate change impacts on hydrology but then again overall uncertainty and the relative contribution of each uncertainty source is deserved to be further investigated in future studies this study only investigated the climate change impacts on the flood while other anthropogenic factors were not considered for the flood simulation for example human activities such as reservoir operations land use and land cover changes and new dam constructions may alter the flood regimes wen et al 2021 li et al 2022a li et al 2022b as a global study taking into account the impacts of human activities on the change of flood characteristics is a big challenge this is especially true for this study when using lumped hydrological models for hydrological simulations however human activities are partly generalized by parameters of lumped hydrological models since they are well calibrated thus the use of well calibrated lumped hydrological models can partly offset the advantages of using distributed hydrological models with a consideration of human activities in addition this study only investigated the changes of flood regimes and their implication to current flood defense standards in various warming periods future studies can further analyzed the exposures of population and economy in the flooded area to achieve this the gridded streamflow time series simulated by global climate models can be input to hydrodynamic models such as the cama flood model yamazaki et al 2011 to delineate the inundated areas of certain recurrence frequency future flood risks can be projected more specifically by employing demographic and economic data development trajectories in this way the impacts of unnatural factors on global warming and the socioeconomic flood exposures in response to global warming could be associated which helps make strategies for flood mitigations however the lumped hydrological models were used for outlet hydrological simulations in this study the point flood events cannot map the gridded demographic and economic data therefore further analysis on the exposures of population and economy in the flooded area deserves more effort in future studies 9 conclusions this study assesses the responses of river floods to 1 5 2 0 2 5 and 3 0 c warming climates above pre industrial levels from a global perspective and their implication to the current flood protection standards specifically four well calibrated lumped hydrological models i e xaj gr4j simhyd and hmets are used to simulate the daily streamflow time series using 15 bias corrected climate model simulations under two ssp scenarios from the cmip6 achieve the frequency and magnitude of the design level flood defined by the flopros dataset and the 50 year flood are quantified employing the flood return period and return value as indices the reference period 1985 2014 is defined as a baseline to calculate the changes for various warming periods the following main conclusions can be drawn 1 the intensification of the absolute changes of rcptot and rx1day are accompanied by the increase of warming levels in the future prcptot would increase in mid high latitudes of north america most regions of eurasia and africa except the mediterranean coast and southern africa with climate warming while rx1day would increase throughout continents irrespective of the warming level for the 3 0 c warming level under the ssp245 scenario the averaged prcptot is projected to increase by about 19 8 among 88 land grid and the averaged rx1day is projected to increase by 14 1 for 99 land grids 2 the changes of the annual maximum streamflow follow a similar spatial pattern for four warming levels an overall increasing trend is projected for most regions especially for western north america africa southeast eurasia and australia more watersheds would show increases in the magnitude and larger extent of changes with the warming from 1 5 to 3 0 c approximately 89 and 95 of watersheds worldwide would experience the increasing annual maximum streamflow respectively for the 1 5 and 3 0 c warming periods 3 the impact of global warming on the changes of flood frequency is projected to amplify with higher air temperature the median return periods of 50 year flood across all watersheds are projected to be 48 year 41 year 30 year and 23 year for the 1 5 2 0 2 5 and 3 0 warming periods respectively for the hotspots of southeast eurasia africa and south america the reference level 50 year flood would occur every 15 30 years for 28 16 and 19 watersheds respectively at the 1 5 c warming level these proportions are projected to rise to 47 38 and 51 for the 3 0 c warming level the amplification effect of higher air temperature on the flood magnitude is also observed especially for watersheds with positive trends the globally averaged increases in 50 year flood return values are projected to be 1 4 4 3 10 6 and 15 9 for the 1 5 2 0 2 5 and 3 0 c warming periods the regionally averaged 50 year return values are projected to increase respectively by 11 6 14 1 and 7 6 for areas with positive trends in southeast eurasia africa and south america for the 1 5 c warming period and increase by 25 6 30 6 and 16 4 for the 3 0 c warming period respectively 4 for four warming periods the design level flood frequency is projected to increase for north america central and eastern coastal south america northwestern europe africa most areas of asia and australia whereas the decreasing trend is observed for mid latitude north america northeastern south america southeastern europe and southern south africa with a higher level of warming more watersheds would face more significant pressures on flood defenses as the increasing trend in design level flood frequency gradually dominates all continents under the ssp245 scenario the proportions of watersheds showing frequency increases are 47 55 70 and 74 for 1 5 2 0 2 5 and 3 0 c warming periods southeast eurasia africa and south america are detected as hotspots with higher flood defense pressures 5 the median variances of the changes in 50 year flood magnitude over all watersheds are projected to be 5 7 7 6 8 9 and 9 8 for the 1 5 2 0 2 5 and 3 0 c warming periods respectively gcm and the interaction among gcm ssp and hm are two major sources to overall uncertainty for the changes of flood characteristics specifically gcm explains approximately 42 41 43 from 1 5 to 3 0 c of the overall uncertainty and the interactions in total explain 49 48 52 ssp and hm only contribute about 1 and 8 6 9 of overall uncertainty respectively in particular the contribution of ssp and hm is uniform for all global watersheds the amplification effect of higher air temperatures on changing trends is summarized for flood related indices these results highlight the necessity for more stringent temperature constraints and adequate flood adaptation and mitigation strategies in addition more efforts should be made to improve flood protection capacity in areas such as southeast eurasia africa and south america credit authorship contribution statement jie chen conceptualization formal analysis methodology project administration supervision

2247,hydrodynamics are the key factor influencing sediment resuspension transport and nutrient release in large shallow lakes however the hydrodynamic responses of bottom traps during pollutant capture remain unclear in this study a large eutrophic shallow lake was selected to carry out a field test of deep traps at the lake bottom based on observations of the lake current around the trap the sedimentation rate of the particles in the trap and the nutrient content of the captured sediments combined with the numerical simulation of the waves outside the trap the effects of lake currents and waves on the sediment deposition in the traps were studied and the response of the nutrient content of the sediments captured in the deep traps to the changes in lake currents and waves was analyzed the results showed that the strong hydrodynamic force significantly promoted sediment deposition in the trap and enhanced the ability of the trap to capture sediments with high nutrient contents the influences of waves and lake currents on the bottom trap capture of polluted sediments varied among different periods waves played the leading role in winter and spring accelerating sediment capture in the bottom traps near the southern shore of eastern lake chaohu during this period in summer the lake current was the main dynamic factor contributing to the rapid deposition of particulate matter and the capture of sediments with high nutrient contents in the bottom traps of western lake chaohu the multiple stepwise linear regression model based on lake current and wave data explained 37 6 of the sediment deposition in the trap and the model built for a single bottom trap explained more than 80 of the deposition after correcting the sediment deposition thickness in the trap by considering the water content of the sediment the quantitative relation yield better inversion results for the sediment deposition process and different thicknesses in the bottom trap were linked to different sediment deposition periods according to the hydrodynamic strength in 2020 the thickness of the highly contaminated sediments captured by traps cc1 cc5 was calculated to be 1 09 1 93 m and the corresponding tn and tp were 26 66 68 53 kg and 6 84 19 89 kg respectively this study provides a scientific analysis and guidance for the evaluation of endogenous nutrients captured by lake bottom trap methods keywords bottom trap particles wave current nitrogen and phosphorus content data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction contaminants in aquatic ecosystems may be adsorbed onto suspended particles and primarily settle in sediments when exogenous inputs are controlled high internal sediment loadings may greatly delay the lake recovery process a series of techniques have been developed and applied in recent decades to reduce internal nutrient loading including capping huser et al 2016 yin and kong 2015 dredging annadotter et al 1999 chen et al 2018 liu et al 2016b in situ remediation lürling et al 2016 and phytoremediation gu et al 2016 xiang et al 2009 among these approaches dredging can effectively reduce the endogenous pollution of lakes annadotter et al 1999 liu et al 2016b and has been widely applied to the treatment of many heavily polluted lakes however due to the influence of many uncertain factors such as the resuspension of the surrounding polluted sediment during the dredging process the release of pollutants in the new sediment after dredging the residue of polluted sediment during the dredging process and the continuous inflow of exogenous pollution after the dredging the treatment effect is controversial bridges et al 2010 liu et al 2016a 2016b in addition dredging may decrease the number abundance and biomass of local benthic macroinvertebrates wan hussin et al 2012 and damage the lake bottom ecosystem therefore technology for the treatment of highly polluted sediments at a lower cost and with less disturbance to the environment has been developed bianchini et al 2019 polrot et al 2021 constructing deep traps at the bottom of lakes to capture pollutants and algal species through hydrodynamics is an emerging endogenous pollution control and management technology van liere and jonkers 2002 hu 2018 to effectively capture highly polluted sediments a key function of the bottom trap is to form a relatively static weak hydrodynamic environment so that the pollutants captured in the trap will not be easily resuspended into the water body due to hydrodynamic disturbance and transported to other areas with the lake current through repeated wind and wave disturbance and lake current transport the highly polluted flow mud is continuously collected and then the sediment in the trap is directly removed by mechanical excavation compared with dredging this method has the low cost advantages high efficiency a small disturbance area and little impact on the lake bottom ecosystem and has broad application prospects in the control and management of endogenous pollutants in large shallow eutrophic lakes zhang et al 2021a 2021b 2021c 2021d lake currents and waves as the main hydrodynamic forces in shallow lakes interact with each other to affect the transport of substances in water de vicente et al 2010 joensuu et al 2018 zhu et al 2015 the relationship between sediment resuspension and hydrodynamic disturbance intensity has been widely studied over the years based on field observations of the great lakes in the united states lick 2008 showed that the concentration and diameter of resuspended sediment are related to the shear stress near the sediment water interface field observations in lake taihu show that when the wind speed is approximately 5 6 m s corresponding to a bottom velocity 0 1 m s a large amount of sediment resuspension occurs tang et al 2020 strong wind and wave disturbance will be conducive to the resuspension of lake bottom sediments and the strength of lake currents plays a key role in the transport process of materials according to the principle of deep trap technology the formation of a weak hydrodynamic environment or even a still water environment in the trap will be conducive to the sedimentation and storage of particles that migrate to the top of the trap therefore lake currents and waves are the main hydrodynamic factors that affect the collection of particles in the bottom trap however the relationship between lake currents and waves and the sediment deposition in the trap is still unclear and needs to be further explored the interaction between waves and lake currents not only controls and affects the process of sediment resuspension mixing and migration but also affects the changes in oxidation potential ph and dissolved oxygen in sediments further controlling the migration and transformation of nutrients and has a great impact on the release of nutrients from sediments chen et al 2017 yang et al 2017 in recent decades the relationship between hydrodynamics and water quality has attracted extensive attention studies have shown that hydrodynamic disturbance can affect water quality by affecting the release of nitrogen and phosphorus from sediments hu 2016 tang et al 2020 fan et al 2003 and the release rate of phosphorus is significantly positively correlated with the hydrodynamic disturbance strength li et al 2017 qin et al 2003 fan et al 2001 reported that the internal phosphorus load induced by resuspension was 8 10 times greater than the static release compared with phosphorus which exists mostly as inorganic particles in water nitrogen exhibits more complex responses to hydrodynamic variations reddy et al 1996 claimed that the resuspension fluxes of ammonia increased 10 fold compared with the diffusion flux recent research has found that the nitrogen content in shallow eutrophic lakes is significantly affected by algal migration shi et al 2022 after the construction of the trap inorganic particles and organic particles such as algae are continuously collected and stored in the trap driven by hydrodynamic force the nutrient content of the collected particles is a key index to evaluate the effectiveness of capturing pollutants in deep traps due to the weak hydrodynamic conditions in the trap the probability of resuspension of particles captured in the deep trap is reduced so the sediment that migrates to the trap under hydrodynamic action at different periods can be better stored however previous researchers have focused more on the ability of bottom traps to capture highly polluting sediments zhang et al 2021a 2021b and less attention has been given to the contribution of lake hydrodynamics to the ability of traps to capture sediments with high nutrient contents in this study lake chaohu a large shallow eutrophic lake frequently disturbed by wind and waves was selected as the research object based on previous research zhang et al 2021a 2021b the present study built seven traps at different bottom locations of lake chaohu according to the hydrodynamic field and nutrient distribution zhang et al 2021c 2021d the lake current outside the trap and the sediment deposition rate and sediment nutrients in the trap were observed and the waves in lake chaohu were calculated by using the wind wave model the objectives of this study were 1 to identify the influence characteristics of hydrodynamic seasonal differences on sediment capture effect in bottom trap 2 to establish the quantitative relationship between bottom trap sedimentation and hydrodynamic indexes 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was performed in lake chaohu in central anhui province china 117 16 54 117 51 46 e and 31 43 28 31 25 28 n this lake is a large

lake chaohu basin are 1063 mm and 16 1 c respectively peng et al 2021 since 1970 due to rapid socioeconomic development external pollution loadings have increased causing accelerated eutrophication and the growth of harmful algae and arousing widespread concern among scholars 2 2 data collection 2 2 1 sediment sampling and chemical analysis mechanical excavation was used to construct a lake

meteorological data around the trap from november 2019 to december 2020 were collected including water quality flow velocity and wind field water quality data and flow velocity observation data were provided by the administration bureau of lake chaohu ablc water quality data were obtained from stationary buoys including water temperature wt dissolved oxygen do electrical conductivity ec ph tn and tp w1 w7 were the water quality measurement points near bottom traps cc1 cc7 which could approximately reflect the variation in surface quality around the traps fig 1 buoy data were recorded every 4 h flow velocity data were obtained using acoustic doppler current profilers adcps v1 v7 were the current measurement points near traps cc1 cc7 which could approximately reflect the continuous variation in lake current intensity around the traps velocity data were recorded by adcp every 0 4 m from the bottom to the surface with a total of 10 layers and the monitoring frequency was every 10 min in this study the vertical mean velocity u1 and bottom velocity u2 were selected for analysis from november 2019 to december 2020 the wave strength characteristics were determined through numerical swan model simulating waves nearshore experiments zhang and hu 2020 the temporal wind fields of the national meteorological information center cmdc https data cma cn at the hefei chaohu and lujiang meteorological stations in the chaohu lake basin were interpolated 2 3 sediment thickness and sedimentation rate to eliminate the influences of sediment disturbance and suspension caused by the trap construction the sedimentation rate of each trap was monitored one month after trap construction was completed and the efficiency of collecting suspended particles in each trap was accurately evaluated depth monitoring inside and outside the traps was to be carried out once a month however in february monitoring was not carried out due to the covid 19 epidemic in addition from june to august a major flood occurred in lake chaohu resulting in the water level increasing 3 4 m above the normal level the trap location markers were submerged during this time and could not be located thus interrupting monitoring the depth of the six fixed positions in the trap was monitored with a bathymetric rope four of these positions were located in the four corners of the bottom trap with the other two located in the middle of the trap at the same time the water depth outside the trap was monitored the depth of the trap was calculated as the difference in water depth between the inside and outside the trap and the sediment thickness and sedimentation rate in each month were calculated by using the monitored values in different months the formula is as follows 1 s h 1 h 2 h 3 h 4 2 v s t h1 and h2 are the water depths m inside and outside the trap respectively obtained by using the bathymetry rope in the previous time h3 and h4 are the water depths m inside and outside the trap respectively obtained by using the bathymetry rope in the current time and the water depth measurement accuracy is 0 001 m s is the thickness m of sediment deposited in the bottom trap calculated during the two probes t is the number of days d during the two exploration periods and v is the sediment deposition rate m d during the period 2 4 inversion of sedimentation period the sediment columnar samples in different traps were collected in the field three times and the physical and chemical indexes of the mud samples were determined by laboratory experiments after field segmentation with a thickness of 0 05 m however the siltation period corresponding to each 0 05 m mud sample and the changes in lake flow and waves within the corresponding period are not certain and it is difficult to sample in the field during inclement weather it is difficult to timely monitor the changes in sediment captured by hydrodynamic disturbances of different intensities therefore to explore the influence of lake currents and waves on the nutrients in sediments captured by bottom traps it is necessary to invert the period of sediment deposition in the traps 2 4 1 mc correction the surface sediments of shallow lakes are frequently disturbed by lake currents and waves resulting in high mc the particles that are resuspended due to the disturbance are transported to the upper part of the bottom trap by the lake current and are then captured in the trap therefore most of the sediments collected in the trap are sediments with high mc however due to the continuous compaction of sediments trapped in the bottom trap the mc gradually decreases from top to bottom with increasing siltation thickness therefore under the condition of the same hydrodynamic disturbance and siltation thickness the lower sediments with lower mc in the trap need a longer siltation period than the upper sediments with higher mc therefore the mc should be used to correct the sediment thickness before inversion of the sediment deposition period since the surface sediments in the bottom trap are newly captured particles it can be considered that they have not been compacted so the mc of the surface sediments is taken as the benchmark for the correction of the lower sediments the equation is as follows 3 s correction mc 0 mc i s i where scorrection is the corrected sedimentation rate mc0 is the mc corresponding to surface sediments li is the sampling sediment thickness of layer i and mci is the mc of sediment at layer i 2 4 2 inversion of sediment deposition period the mc of the surface sediments collected three times in different periods 2020 1 12 2020 4 13 2020 4 14 2020 9 18 2020 9 19 2020 12 23 was used to correct the siltation thickness of the lower sediments in different periods and the siltation thickness of the surface sediments did not need to be corrected in addition due to the possibility of repeated sampling for three samplings that is with the decrease in the depth in the trap the deposition rate decreases and the sampling depth is greater than the deposition thickness of the sediment in the trap during the current period the sediment data of the second sampling overlap so this part of the data needs to be eliminated and only the sediment data deposited in the current period are retained after determining sediment deposition thickness in three periods of different bottom traps and correcting based on the mc according to the model constructed in the supplementary text s1 the daily sediment deposition rate m d in different traps can be calculated by substituting the daily mean of the selected hydrodynamic factors into the model so the daily sediment deposition thickness m can be determined after the accumulation of the daily deposition thickness in the three periods the accumulated value was compared with the actual deposition thickness of the three periods the model with the smallest difference among the results was retained and the ratio of the actual deposition thickness to the accumulated value was used to correct the daily deposition thickness the collected sediment column samples were arranged in different traps on the time scale and the column samples were divided into n parts according to the cut thickness corrected by mc correspondingly the deposition thickness obtained from the model is also divided into n parts since the hydrodynamic factors applied in the model are continuous on the time scale and the sediment deposition thickness in the trap has been determined every day the time period corresponding to each part of the sediment calculated by the model can be determined that is the deposition period of each sediment in the trap 2 4 3 particle size validation particle size is one of the basic physical characteristics of sediments and is controlled by the dynamic conditions of transport and deposition processes and is closely related to the sedimentary environment dalu et al 2020 tang et al 2019 particles disturbed by wind waves and transported to the top of the trap by lake currents are constantly collected in the trap according to stokes law sediment distribution is strongly affected by sediment density and hydrodynamic conditions guo et al 2018 schreiner et al 2013 wang et al 2015 particles are hydrodynamically sorted during transport causing particles with lower buoyancy larger density and coarser particle size to settle rapidly while particles with higher buoyancy lower density and finer particle size will undergo further transport bao et al 2018 wakeham et al 2009 theoretically under the influence of lake currents and waves outside the trap during different periods the size of particles settling in the trap will be significantly different that is when the wind waves are strong the particle size captured in the trap will be relatively large and when the wind waves are weak the particle size captured in the trap will be relatively small therefore the internal relationship between particle size data and hydrodynamic factors in different periods can be established to verify the inversion results in the period of sediment deposition in the trap as a representative parameter of particle size the median particle size represents the characteristics of the overall particle size after inversion of the sediment deposition period the specific deposition period corrected for mc of sampled and segmented sediments in each trap was obtained the average values of lake currents and waves in the corresponding siltation period of each layer of sediment were correlated with the median particle size of sediment and the hydrodynamic factors with significant correlations with different particle size data were determined correlation analysis was carried out between the average value of lake current u1 u2 the kinetic energy of u1 eu1 the kinetic energy of u2 eu2 and wave wavelength water depth l d l significant wave height hs the potential energy ew and the median particle size and particle sizes of 4 μm 4 8 μm 8 16 μm 16 32 μm 32 64 μm and greater than 64 μm of sediments in the sedimentation period of each layer of sediment then the hydrodynamic factors that were significantly correlated with different particle size data were determined linear regression analysis was conducted between the selected hydrodynamic factors and particle size to obtain the influence of hydrodynamic factors on different particle sizes 2 5 statistical analysis excel and spss software were used for statistical analysis of the data based on the nonparametric test method kruskal wallis kw which was used to test the spatiotemporal differences in sediment deposition rate sediment physicochemical factors water physicochemical factors lake current and waves in the nearby water and the significance levels were p 0 01 extremely significant p 0 05 significant and p greater than 0 05 nonsignificant the relationship between the sedimentation rate in the trap and the lake current and wave was established by linear regression and multiple stepwise regression analysis according to the inversion results of the sediment deposition period in the bottom trap the average value of the lake current wave and water quality data during the deposition period corresponding to each layer of sediment was calculated pearson correlation analysis was used to evaluate the relationships between sediment physicochemical factors tn tp chla mc om and lake current u1 u2 eu1 eu2 wave l d l hs ew and water physicochemical factors wt ph do ec ntu tp tn near the trap redundancy analysis rda was used to explore the effects of lake currents waves and water body physicochemical factors on sediment physicochemical indicators to further clarify the effect of sediment nutrients in different bottom traps of lake currents and waves trap cc3 with strong waves in winter and spring and bottom traps with strong lake currents in summer were selected regression analysis was carried out between these traps and the relationships between the sediment nutrients collected in the trap and the waves and lake currents were obtained 3 results 3 1 relationship between sedimentation rate and hydrodynamic factors 3 1 1 sedimentation rates the temporal and spatial variation in the sediment deposition rate in different traps are shown in fig 2 the results showed that the sedimentation rates of the traps in lake chaohu obviously differed spatially and temporally p 0 05 on average throughout the year the sedimentation rates exhibited the following order v cc1 v cc2 v cc3 v cc4 v cc5 v cc7 v cc6 the sedimentation rates inside the traps in western lake chaohu were the highest the trap depths of cc6 and cc7 rapidly decreased to 0 81 m and 1 77 m respectively in april as the trap depth decreases the hydrodynamic strength in the trap increases which weakens the collection ability of the trap and affects the sedimentation rate comparison of the sedimentation rates of different traps among different periods of the year revealed that the sedimentation rates were high in summer and autumn from april to september in contrast to those of traps cc6 and cc7 which were in the centre of the lake most of the sedimentation rates in the five nearshore traps were above 0 004 m d in winter and spring the sedimentation rates in the five nearshore traps were 0 002 m d except cc3 the sediment rate higher from january to march reaching 0 0114 m d than in other periods which was mainly the result of different hydrodynamic intensities during different periods 3 1 2 hydrodynamic variations according to the results of field observations of lake currents near different bottom traps of lake chaohu during the observation period u1 0 0006 0 559 m s mean 0 035 m s and u2 0 0008 0 528 m s mean 0 061 m s outside the traps varied widely fig s1 which reflected different hydrodynamic intensities u2 was significantly larger than u1 p 0 01 the velocity of the waters near the bottom trap of western lake chaohu was the highest in summer and the velocity in southeastern lake chaohu was the highest in winter the wind waves near the bottom traps cc1 cc7 were larger in winter and spring and smaller in autumn spatially the wind waves at cc6 and cc7 in the middle of the lake were relatively large while the wind waves near the shore were relatively small mainly due to the influences of topography water depth and the masking of wind by the shoreline among them the wind waves in the water near the bottom trap near the shore of eastern lake chaohu were larger than those near the bottom trap near the shore of western lake chaohu due to the paper length limitation details of lake current flow direction and wind wave data near each bottom trap are provided in supplementary text s2 3 1 3 relationship between sedimentation rate and hydrodynamic factors based on the sedimentation rate in the cc1 cc5 traps and the lake current and wave near the traps the regression analysis showed that the sedimentation rate was positively correlated with the hydrodynamic p 0 01 fig 3 u1 u2 eu1 and eu2 explain 30 17 34 and 23 of the variation in sedimentation rates respectively indicating that lake current strength outside the trap can significantly affect the sediment deposition effect in traps with the enhancement of lake current energy the amount of sediment resuspension will increase and the sediment amounts settled into traps will also increase with the lake current transport resulting in the acceleration of sedimentation rate from the perspective of waves l d accounts for 20 of the sedimentation rate indicating that an increase in l d will be beneficial to sediment deposition in the trap since sediment capture in the trap is a process of continuous accumulation there is a positive correlation between sediment deposition and cumulative energy of lake currents and waves eu sum ew sum the regression analysis results of the monthly sedimentation thickness in traps cc1 cc5 and the cumulative energy showed that there were significant positive correlations p 0 01 except ew sum p greater than 0 05 fig 4 eu1 sum and eu2 sum can explain 74 and 60 sedimentation thickness variation respectively indicating that the enhancement of lake currents will significantly increase the sediment deposition amounts in the traps according to the above analysis there is a positive correlation between sediment deposition and lake currents and waves but a single hydrodynamic factor accounts for 40 of the sedimentation rate which is relatively low therefore to improve the interpretation degree the key hydrodynamic influencing factors should be considered together the results of multiple stepwise regression analysis between sedimentation rate and l d l hs u1 u2 eu1 and eu2 are shown in table 1 compared with the single factor regression results of hydrodynamic factors the model combining different influencing factors can explain the change in sedimentation rate in the trap better to different degrees and the relationship constructed by cc3 in the bottom trap can explain 85 of the variation 3 2 inversion of sediment deposition period 3 2 1 reconstruction of sediment mc to quantitatively characterize the relationship between sediment mc in the trap and sediment depth and to obtain the variation characteristics of sediments in each trap along the entire vertical profile stratified monitoring data of sediment mc in cc1 cc2 cc3 and cc5 on september 28 and december 23 2020 were used and the relation between mc and stratification depth was established many studies have shown that the mc of lake sediments decreases with the depth of sediments as a power function lewis et al 2009 chapra and reckhow 1993 therefore in the fitting process the average value of two observations in each 0 05 m layer was calculated first and then approximately 80 of the data points in the upper layer were used to establish the power function relationship and approximately 20 of the data in the lower layer were used to verify the model accuracy the specific results are shown in fig 5 according to the fitting results the deterministic coefficients of the fitting process of sediment mc in traps cc1 cc3 and cc5 with the change in depth are all above 0 70 which means that the mc shows a consistent decreasing power function with the change in depth the cc2 fitting results were relatively poor with a certainty coefficient of 0 54 from the verification results the root mean square error rmse between the simulated and measured sediment mc in the four traps ranged from 0 008 to 0 068 with an average of 0 034 the specific results are shown in table 2 3 2 2 mc correction basically as the sediment thickness increases the mc shows a trend of first decreasing and then fluctuating the mc of the surface sediments in the trap is 1 209 times higher than that of the bottom layer on average indicating that the compaction in the trap is obvious due to the paper length limitations the specific correction results are given in the supplementary text s3 according to the fitting results of dry matter thickness and sediment thickness corrected by mc fig s3 the deterministic coefficients of traps cc1 cc2 cc3 and cc5 are all above 0 94 indicating that the change in sediment thickness corrected by mc can better reflect the change in dry matter thickness 3 2 3 inversion of sedimentation period according to the stepwise multiple regression model in table 1 the accumulative values of daily sediment deposition thickness calculated by different models during the three periods from january 12 to april 13 april 13 to september 18 and september 19 to december 23 are compared with the actual sediment deposition thickness in different bottom traps of the three periods after correction the results show that the difference between the deposition thickness obtained from models 1 6 and the deposition thickness is small which the rmse ranged from 0 91 to 10 9 with an average of 4 79 after correction with the actual deposition thickness the daily sediment deposition thickness of different traps obtained from models 1 6 is shown in fig 6 although model 1 is suitable for different bottom traps models 2 6 with a higher coefficient r2 of determination and smaller difference between the results and actual deposition thickness are preferred for use in the inversion during the deposition period the specific calculation results are limited by the paper length please refer to the supplementary text s4 for details the sediment deposition rate data of cc1 cc2 cc3 and cc5 in the year were used to quantitatively characterize the relationship between the sediment deposition rate calculated from dry matter thickness and hydrodynamic factors u1 u2 eu1 eu2 in the trap the specific results are shown in fig s5 according to the fitting results the certainty coefficients of the fitting process with the variation in hydrodynamic factors are all above 0 50 which means that the sediment deposition rate in the trap shows a good linear trend of increasing with the increase in lake current intensity 3 2 4 particle size verification after the variation characteristics of sediment particle size in different bottom traps were determined see supplementary text s5 the intrinsic relationship between sediment particle size in bottom traps and hydrodynamic factors was established the correlation analysis between sediment particle size and hydrodynamic factors in different bottom traps is shown in table s3 the results showed that the median particle size and 16 32 μm particle size proportion were significantly positively correlated with l d l hs and ew p 0 05 4 μm and 4 8 μm particle size proportions were significantly negatively correlated with l d l hs and ew p 0 05 and 8 16 μm particle size proportions were significantly negatively correlated with u1 u2 eu1 and eu2 p 0 05 indicating that sediment particle size in the trap was significantly correlated with the strength of the lake current and waves outside the trap linear regression analysis was performed on the hydrodynamic factors and sediment particle size data with significant correlation fig s7 although the coefficient of determination of the relationship between the hydrodynamic factors and particle size data was low r 2 0 2 they all passed the significance test p 0 05 indicating that the selected hydrodynamic factors can significantly affect the particle size of the sediment captured in the trap but are not the only determinants the results show that with increasing l d l hs and ew outside the trap the proportion of small sized particles in the trap decreases and the proportion of large sized particles increases with the enhancement of the lake current the proportion of particles in the 8 16 μm size class in the trap gradually decreased indicating that with the enhancement of the lake current and waves outside the trap the particle size of the sediment captured in the trap showed a changing trend from fine to coarse based on the linear regression analysis of particle size and hydrodynamic factors ew has the highest degree of explanation explaining 15 of the variation in 16 32 μm class in traps according to the change in the 16 32 μm particle size of sediments in traps cc1 cc5 and ew during the corresponding deposition period the variation trend was similar the coincidence degree of traps cc1 and cc2 in some periods was relatively high and the coincidence degree of trap cc3 was relatively poor in general the inversion period was basically consistent with the actual deposition period fig s8 3 3 effects of hydrodynamic strength on sediment nutrients according to the above results the hydrodynamic force can directly affect the nutrient content in the trap by affecting the sedimentation rate in the trap at the same time under the influence of wind waves and lake currents on the one hand the disturbance will release sediment nutrients and thus affect the nutrient content in the water on the other hand the transport of lake currents and the mixing of wind waves will cause the mixing of physical and chemical indexes in different spatial water bodies of shallow lakes the change in physical and chemical properties in water will further affect the change in the properties of the particles captured in the trap that is the hydrodynamic force has an indirect effect on the particles in the trap by affecting the change in nutrients in the water due to the paper length limitation details of the vertical variation of sediment nutrients collected in the trap and the changes of water nutrients near the trap are provided in the supplementary text s6 therefore correlation analysis was conducted on hydrodynamic strength indexes lake currents and wind waves and water nutrient indexes in different periods according to the deposition period established above and the results are shown in fig 8a in general the dynamic indexes related to waves will have negative effects on wt tn and tp and positive effects on do and ph indicating that weak wind wave conditions will be conducive to the formation of low wt low do and low ph environments the hydrodynamic indexes related to lake currents had positive effects on wt turbidity tn and tp and negative effects on do and ph indicating that a strong lake current process would be beneficial to wt mixing sediment suspension and nitrogen and phosphorus nutrient release the flow velocity index tn tp and turbidity in water were further analysed as shown in fig 7 the results show that tp r 2 0 223 p 0 001 and turbidity r 2 0 467 p 0 001 increase significantly with increasing flow velocity indicating that when the lake current is strong hydrodynamic disturbance will cause resuspension of highly polluted sediments in the surface layer resulting in a significant increase in turbidity in the water outside the trap and further leading to an increase in phosphorus content in the water according to the correlation analysis of sediment nutrients captured in the trap with hydrodynamic indexes lake current and wave intensity and water physical and chemical factors during the sedimentation period of each layer of sediment in the trap fig 8 a the results showed that the sediment nutrients captured in different traps were significantly positively correlated with the contents of om and chla in the sediment p 0 01 in particular the correlation coefficient between tn and om was as high as 0 839 indicating that they are closely related tn and om in the sediments were positively correlated with the lake current u1 u2 eu1 eu2 with correlation coefficients ranging from 0 243 to 0 326 p 0 01 and negatively correlated with waves l d l hs with correlation coefficients ranging from 0 331 to 0 249 p 0 01 in addition the contents of tn tp and om in the sediment captured in the traps were positively correlated with the tn and tp in the water outside the traps p 0 01 and negatively correlated with ph and do the contents of tn and om in the sediment were positively correlated with the wt outside the trap while the contents of tp in the sediment were negatively correlated with the wt rda was further used to analyse the influence of lake current waves and water physicochemical factors explanatory variables outside the trap on sediment nutrients response variables captured in the trap the first two axes explained 33 4 of the variation in sediment nutrients in the traps with reflecting good results fig 8b the rda results showed that the nitrogen and phosphorus contents in sediments were closely related to the nitrogen and phosphorus contents in the lake on the one hand the enhancement of lake currents could increase nitrogen and phosphorus contents in water bodies and thus positively affect the nitrogen and phosphorus contents captured in the traps on the other hand intensified lake currents promoted the increase in om content captured in the traps and further increased the nutrient content of sediments in the traps to further analyse the contribution of lake currents and waves to the nutrient content of sediments captured by the bottom traps the linear regression analysis results of tn om and waves wave intensity was only characterized by l d here in the sediments in all bottom traps and in trap cc3 in winter and spring period of strong wind and waves showed that with the increase in l d the content of tn and om in sediments captured in all bottom traps showed a decreasing trend tn r 2 0 09 p 0 05 n 125 om r 2 0 07 p 0 05 n 125 but the tn and om content of sediments captured in trap cc3 showed an upward trend in winter and spring tn r 2 0 31 p 0 05 n 16 om r 2 0 27 p 0 05 n 16 indicating that stronger waves are beneficial to the increase in tn and om content in sediments in trap cc3 in winter and spring fig 9 the linear regression analysis results of tn tp and om of sediments in all bottom traps and in summer bottom traps and bottom lake currents showed that the bottom flow velocity was positively correlated with the contents of tn tp and om captured in the bottom traps tn r 2 0 06 p 0 01 n 125 tp r 2 0 08 p 0 01 n 125 om r 2 0 08 p 0 01 n 125 fig 9 the interpretation of the nutrient content of sediments captured in the bottom trap by the bottom lake current in summer was significantly improved tn r 2 0 23 p 0 01 n 57 tp r 2 0 28 p 0 01 n 57 om r 2 0 28 p 0 05 n 125 indicating that the strong bottom lake current in summer was conducive to the increase in tn tp and om content in the sediment deposited in the bottom trap 3 4 assessment of the total amount of sediment captured by bottom traps based on the hydrodynamic index according to the relationship of models 1 6 in table 1 and using the hydrodynamic indicators of a complete year in 2020 as variables it can be estimated that the thicknesses of sediments that can be captured by cc1 to cc5 are 1 91 m 1 68 m 1 93 m 1 09 m and 1 68 m respectively fig 10 in general the bottom traps in the western lake chaohu area collected the largest annual total amount of pollutants among which the annual total amount of tn and tp collected in trap cc1 was 68 53 kg and 19 89 kg respectively and the annual total amount of tn and tp collected in trap cc2 was 44 59 kg and 14 8 kg respectively followed by cc3 tn 44 03 kg tp 13 21 kg 4 discussion 4 1 influences of currents and waves on deposition rate lake currents and waves are the main factors affecting the sediment deposition rate in the bottom trap of lake chaohu and there are obvious differences in sediment deposition characteristics under different dynamic conditions in different positions of the trap generally in shallow lakes under the action of a stable wind field the energy transferred from wind energy to waves gradually increases and the wave action gradually becomes stronger when the wind energy increases to a certain intensity the intensity of wind waves will not increase babanin 2006 wu et al 2016 especially in areas with a long fetch and shallow water depths turbulence caused by wind disturbance and waves will lead to a large amount of sediment resuspension and suspended particles will be transported to the top of the trap by lake currents and then settle into the trap due to gravity theoretically cc6 in the central western area of the lake and cc7 in the central eastern area of the lake located in the open lake area would be favourable locations for constructing the bottom trap the results also showed that the waves and lake currents at the centre of the lake were strong which was conducive to capturing a large number of particles in the trap however the sediment deposition rates in traps cc6 and cc7 were significantly lower than those in the other bottom traps and the sediment deposition thicknesses in traps cc6 and cc7 were only 0 107 m and 0 211 m respectively after the observation this is mainly due to the large thickness of light sediments in the centre of lake chaohu zhang et al 2021d which makes it difficult to form a bottom trap with a stable sidewall although the sidewall fixed material is also considered to be used in actual operation due to frequent hydrodynamic disturbance the bottom mud quickly flows into the trap through the bottom of the material which reduces the depth of the trap and weakens the ability of the bottom trap to collect sediment in addition the decrease in the weak hydrodynamic space in the trap also leads to an increase in sediment resuspension probability during the observation period the wind waves were larger in winter and spring fig s2 from january and march the highest sedimentation rate 0 0114 m d was observed for trap cc3 which was related to the location of this trap in the nearshore area on the south side of lake chaohu under the influence of the prevailing northwest wind in winter the wave intensity at trap cc3 was relatively large the sediments were prone to resuspension under the action of wind waves and the bottom offshore lake current transported a large amount of suspended sediments to cc3 forming conditions favourable for the trap to collect lake bottom sediments in summer the dominant wind direction of lake chaohu is the southeast wind trap cc3 is located in a region with a short fetch small wind waves large water depth small force of wind waves on the lake bottom and small resuspension amount of lake bottom sediments therefore the sedimentation rate in the trap decreases at this stage in addition the sediment deposition in trap cc3 reached more than 1 m in april and the reduction in the trap depth weakened the collection capacity of the bottom trap which was also one of the reasons for the decrease in the sedimentation rate in the later observation period in the bottom trap near the shore of lake chaohu all the traps except cc3 are in the high speed deposition stage in summer and the deposition rate is more than 0 004 m d in winter and spring the deposition rate is lower than 0 002 m d mainly because the positions of cc1 cc2 cc4 and cc5 under the prevailing wind in winter are affected by the shoreline and the fetch is short therefore the average hs is relatively small and the wave action is weak which is not conducive to the capture of particles in the trap theoretically under the action of the prevailing southeast wind in summer the wind and waves in the northwestern part of lake chaohu are relatively large and the bottom is prone to resuspension however field observations showed that the lake current outside the bottom trap is relatively large and the average hs is relatively small bachmann et al 2000 showed that horizontal movement on the lakebed was sufficient to resuspend sediment only when the water depth was less than half the wavelength due to the energy dissipation in the vertical diffusion process the turbulent energy reaching the lake bottom sediment varies with the water depth etemad shahidi and imberger 2001 zhu et al 2021 in summer the water depth of lake chaohu is relatively large the effect of waves on the bottom of the lake is small and the influence of the bottom lake current gradually appears zhang et al 2021a the sediment deposition rate in the trap increased significantly with the strengthening of the lake current fig 3 the sediment deposition thickness in cc1 was close to 1 m from may to september and the bottom trap was located near the northwest shore of lake chaohu in summer the bottom lake current had a high velocity and the main direction was southwest transporting a large amount of light sediments to cc1 trap cc2 is located in the southwestern coastal area of western lake chaohu where a certain width of lake current accumulation exists zhang et al 2021d in summer the bottom lake current outside trap cc2 is large and the main direction of the bottom lake current is southeast which transports sediments from areas with a large thickness of light sediment to cc2 forming conditions favourable for the bottom trap to collect lake bottom sediments cc4 and cc5 are located in the nearshore areas in northeastern lake chaohu and central lake chaohu respectively and both have a certain width of lake current gathering area which is limited by the influence of the shoreline therefore although the thickness of the light sediment at these two bottom traps is large the effect of waves and lake currents is relatively small so the sediment deposition rate in the trap is lower than that of cc1 cc3 it should be noted that since the study observed one lake and lake chaohu was investigated before the constructed of bottom trap it was found that there was little difference in the degree of sediment compactness at the bottom so the sediment compactness was not considered as a variable but before this technique applied in other lakes the bottom sediment concentration should be observed and as a factor to analyse the ability of bottom traps to capture sediment in the shallow eutrophic lake 4 2 dynamic response of sediment nutrients to lake hydrodynamics compared with sediment deposition in traps the response of sediment nutrients to lake hydrodynamic dynamics is more complex according to the changes in hydrodynamic forces water nutrients and sediment nutrients in the trap it was suspected that hydrodynamic forces have a significant direct impact on the nutrient content of water with an especially close relationship between lake currents and tp and the turbidity of water fig 7 in shallow lakes when the hydrodynamic disturbance is strong a large amount of sediment mixture is instantly suspended into the overlying water resulting in an increase in water turbidity since tp in water is mainly composed of particulate phosphorus an increase in the concentration of suspended particulate matter will also lead to an increase in tp søndergaard et al 2013 dissolved inorganic nitrogen and organic nitrogen are the main forms of nitrogen in water wu et al 2016 therefore the increases in inorganic particle concentrations caused by hydrodynamic perturbations make a small contribution to tn concentrations in water bodies fig 7 changes in tn and tp in the water body convey a signal that water body nutrient content increases with sediment resuspension which has also been confirmed in other studies ding et al 2018 zhu et al 2004 wu et al 2012 studied lake taihu and found that with the increase in suspended particulate matter tn and tp in the water body increased rapidly but with the end of the disturbance the particulate matter resettled and the nitrogen and phosphorus contents in the water body decreased rapidly indicating that sediment resuspension mainly affected the changes in tn and tp in water by affecting granular nitrogen and phosphorus the resuspended high nitrogen and phosphorus particles are transported to the top of the trap by the lake current and then captured by the bottom trap therefore the change in nitrogen and phosphorus contents in the water near the trap is significantly related to the nitrogen and phosphorus contents in the sediment collected in the trap the above analysis showed that the nitrogen and phosphorus contents of sediments collected in different traps of lake chaohu were significantly correlated with om especially the correlation coefficient between tn and om which reached 0 866 fig 8a qin et al 2007 found that dissolved inorganic nitrogen accounted for 83 4 of tn in a study of rivers entering the lake while organic nitrogen accounted for 98 8 of tn in the lake sediments inorganic nitrogen in the lake would be buried in the sediments in the form of biological debris after being absorbed by organisms therefore the main source of tn captured in different traps of lake chaohu was biodeposition algae are one of the main reservoirs of organic nitrogen and phosphorus in shallow eutrophic lakes and their vertical distribution in water is mainly affected by hydrodynamic disturbance and meteorological biological and water temperature parameters cao et al 2006 lake hydrodynamic disturbance will drive the vertical migration of algae which will lead to the transfer of particulate nitrogen in the water body the results of this study showed that strong waves were beneficial to the increase in tn and om contents in the sediments captured in the trap cc3 in winter and spring fig 9 in winter and spring under the action of the dominant northwest wind of lake chaohu algae gathered downwind and the strong wave disturbance brought algae to the bottom water and transported them into the trap through the bottom offshore lake current which led to the increase in nutrient content in trap cc3 the strong bottom lake current in summer is conducive to the increase in nitrogen and om contents in most sediments deposited in the bottom trap of lake chaohu fig 9 in summer lake chaohu is dominated by microcystis and microcystis cells can use the presence of gas vesicles and changes in intracellular carbohydrates to regulate buoyancy and change the algal cell density in the overlying water in response to light and hydrodynamic perturbations paerl et al 2011 under the action of southeast winds in summer the algae of lake chaohu mostly gathered in the western lake chaohu area so the algae biomass in the waters near traps cc1 and cc2 was relatively high as these traps formed favourable conditions for the collection of algae in summer the lake current is strong and the turbidity in the water body increases while the tn content decreases on the one hand due to the high wt in summer the denitrification effect is strong on the other hand the algae are in a period of high growth and high sedimentation in summer and organic nitrogen in the water body decreases with the sedimentation of algae fan et al 2019 zhou et al 2016 at this time under the action of strong lake currents large amounts of algae and organic debris were transported into the trap resulting in a significant increase in the content of nitrogen and om in the sediments in addition the increase in wt in summer will reduce the viscosity of water with the decrease in viscosity the resistance of water to vertical migration will also decrease thus promoting the upward and downward migration of mobile bloom cyanobacteria in the water column all of the above provide favourable conditions for bottom traps to capture pollutants with high nitrogen and phosphorus contents in summer therefore the contents of tn and om are generally high in the bottom trap in summer with the highest contents in the traps in the western lake chaohu area in autumn and winter the lake current and wave action were weak and algae growth was inhibited due to the lower temperature at this time so the nitrogen content of the sediment captured in the traps decreased the phosphorus content of the sediments captured in the traps was synchronized with the changes in nitrogen content in most periods but the phosphorus content of the sediments captured in the traps decreased slightly in summer which may be mainly attributed to the release of sedimentary phosphorus due to the higher wt in summer yang et al 2020 showed that the phosphorus release flux from sediments in western lake chaohu in summer was 74 times that in winter according to the above analysis the main reason for the high sediment nitrogen content in the trap in summer may be the capture of a large amount of algae the results of this study showed that the sediment chla content captured in the trap peaks in spring and summer but it is lower in summer than in spring fig s9 chla content is known to be a useful indicator for predicting phytoplankton growth status otten et al 2012 the main reason for the lower chla content in the trap in summer may be that the hypoxic environment accelerated the degradation of fresh algae at the sediment water interface leading to the destruction of chloroplast structure due to the high temperature in summer ashraf and harris 2013 nong et al 2021 affected by the difference of hydrodynamic conditions there are significant differences in the capacity of collecting highly polluted flume in the bottom trap at different spatial locations in lake chaohu according to the difference of hydrodynamic spatial distribution in lake chaohu the key to the correct utilization of this technology is to correctly arrange the bottom trap scheme and maximize the capacity of collecting highly polluted flume in the bottom trap 4 3 environmental effect of hydrodynamics at the bottom trap according to the above analysis there are significant spatial and temporal differences between lake currents and waves in lake chaohu and these differences also lead to significant differences in the amount of sediment captured in the trap lake currents and waves also drive changes in the spatial and temporal distribution of algae which affects the nutrient content of sediments captured in the trap after the construction of the bottom trap a relatively static hydrodynamic environment was formed inside the trap which differed from the varying hydrodynamic environment outside the trap and it was easy for highly polluted sediments such as algae to be captured in the trap the strong wind waves in spring mainly affect the capture of sediments by bottom traps in the southeastern coastal zone of lake chaohu in summer the lake current is strong which can affect the accelerated sedimentation of particles in the bottom traps throughout lake at this time the strong lake current and the increase in algal biomass in the overlying water accelerated the capture of algae in the bottom trap in the downwind direction that is the increase in algae content in the trap in the western lake chaohu area therefore combined with the annual total amount of pollutants collected in the trap it is recommended to build bottom traps in areas with strong hydrodynamic forces and easy accumulation of algae this will not only lead to an increase in the sedimentation rate but also increase the content of nutrients captured in the sediment that is increase the probability of capturing algae the current understanding of algal blooms is that a large amount of algae has already accumulated in the water column before the formation of algal blooms when the water environment conditions are suitable these algae will instantly rise to the water surface to form algal blooms therefore the construction of bottom traps at the bottom of the lake will capture the algae present in the water column reducing the material basis of blooms algal cells and reducing the risk of blooms previous authors have concluded that the release of sediment nutrients has a significant impact on the concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus in the water column and that the weak hydrodynamic disturbance in bottom traps can reduce the loss of nitrogen and phosphorus from the sediment zhu et al 2021 it should be noted that chla may be degraded in the sediments captured in the deep trap in summer resulting in lower content under the action of bacteria chla is continuously degraded into pheophytin and then tends to be stable therefore the addition of pheophytin indicators can be considered in follow up studies to comprehensively evaluate the algae collection in the sediments in bottom traps 5 conclusion based on the data of lake currents waves sediment deposition rate and physical and chemical indexes of water and sediment in the waters near different bottom traps the hydrodynamic variation characteristics of the waters near the bottom traps at different positions and the sedimentation process in the traps and its variation characteristics were expounded the response of sediment deposition rates to changes in lake currents and waves were analysed the relationship between hydrodynamic factors and sediment deposition was established and the response law of sediment nutrient content captured in deep traps to hydrodynamic changes was discussed the following conclusions were obtained 1 the action time of lake currents and waves on the capture of sediment in traps was not synchronized during the observation period strong wind waves in winter and spring accelerated the deposition of sediments in the traps in the southern nearshore area of eastern lake chaohu in summer with increasing water depth the effect of waves on lakebed sediments was small and the influence of lake currents gradually became apparent the lake current became the main dynamic factor for the rapid capture of highly polluted sediments in the bottom trap of western lake chaohu 2 lake currents and waves can explain more than 30 and 20 of the sediment deposition rate in the trap respectively the multiple stepwise linear regression model based on lake current and wave data can explain 37 6 of the sediment deposition rate and the model established by a single trap can explain more than 80 after the mc correction of the sediment deposition thickness in the trap the established quantitative relationship can better invert the sediment deposition process and obtain the deposition period of sediments with different thicknesses in the bottom trap according to the research this analytical method is proved to be feasible in the process of applying the obtained formula to other lakes it is necessary to adjust the formula and add or remove some variables to improve the applicability of the formula 3 the enhancement of lake currents can promote an increase in sediment nutrient content in most of the bottom traps while waves have a greater impact on the sediment nutrient content in the bottom traps near the south shore of eastern lake chaohu in winter and spring strong waves in the waters near the bottom trap in southeastern lake chaohu are beneficial to the increase in tn and om contents in the sediments in addition hydrodynamic indicators can be used to assess the total amount of sediment captured in bottom traps this study can provide a scientific basis for improving the ability of bottom traps to capture endogenous nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus in lakes thereby providing a theoretical basis for the application of

2247,hydrodynamics are the key factor influencing sediment resuspension transport and nutrient release in large shallow lakes however the hydrodynamic responses of bottom traps during pollutant capture remain unclear in this study a large eutrophic shallow lake was selected to carry out a field test of deep traps at the lake bottom based on observations of the lake current around the trap the sedimentation rate of the particles in the trap and the nutrient content of the captured sediments combined with the numerical simulation of the waves outside the trap the effects of lake currents and waves on the sediment deposition in the traps were studied and the response of the nutrient content of the sediments captured in the deep traps to the changes in lake currents and waves was analyzed the results showed that the strong hydrodynamic force significantly promoted sediment deposition in the trap and enhanced the ability of the trap to capture sediments with high nutrient contents the influences of waves and lake currents on the bottom trap capture of polluted sediments varied among different periods waves played the leading role in winter and spring accelerating sediment capture in the bottom traps near the southern shore of eastern lake chaohu during this period in summer the lake current was the main dynamic factor contributing to the rapid deposition of particulate matter and the capture of sediments with high nutrient contents in the bottom traps of western lake chaohu the multiple stepwise linear regression model based on lake current and wave data explained 37 6 of the sediment deposition in the trap and the model built for a single bottom trap explained more than 80 of the deposition after correcting the sediment deposition thickness in the trap by considering the water content of the sediment the quantitative relation yield better inversion results for the sediment deposition process and different thicknesses in the bottom trap were linked to different sediment deposition periods according to the hydrodynamic strength in 2020 the thickness of the highly contaminated sediments captured by traps cc1 cc5 was calculated to be 1 09 1 93 m and the corresponding tn and tp were 26 66 68 53 kg and 6 84 19 89 kg respectively this study provides a scientific analysis and guidance for the evaluation of endogenous nutrients captured by lake bottom trap methods keywords bottom trap particles wave current nitrogen and phosphorus content data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction contaminants in aquatic ecosystems may be adsorbed onto suspended particles and primarily settle in sediments when exogenous inputs are controlled high internal sediment loadings may greatly delay the lake recovery process a series of techniques have been developed and applied in recent decades to reduce internal nutrient loading including capping huser et al 2016 yin and kong 2015 dredging annadotter et al 1999 chen et al 2018 liu et al 2016b in situ remediation lürling et al 2016 and phytoremediation gu et al 2016 xiang et al 2009 among these approaches dredging can effectively reduce the endogenous pollution of lakes annadotter et al 1999 liu et al 2016b and has been widely applied to the treatment of many heavily polluted lakes however due to the influence of many uncertain factors such as the resuspension of the surrounding polluted sediment during the dredging process the release of pollutants in the new sediment after dredging the residue of polluted sediment during the dredging process and the continuous inflow of exogenous pollution after the dredging the treatment effect is controversial bridges et al 2010 liu et al 2016a 2016b in addition dredging may decrease the number abundance and biomass of local benthic macroinvertebrates wan hussin et al 2012 and damage the lake bottom ecosystem therefore technology for the treatment of highly polluted sediments at a lower cost and with less disturbance to the environment has been developed bianchini et al 2019 polrot et al 2021 constructing deep traps at the bottom of lakes to capture pollutants and algal species through hydrodynamics is an emerging endogenous pollution control and management technology van liere and jonkers 2002 hu 2018 to effectively capture highly polluted sediments a key function of the bottom trap is to form a relatively static weak hydrodynamic environment so that the pollutants captured in the trap will not be easily resuspended into the water body due to hydrodynamic disturbance and transported to other areas with the lake current through repeated wind and wave disturbance and lake current transport the highly polluted flow mud is continuously collected and then the sediment in the trap is directly removed by mechanical excavation compared with dredging this method has the low cost advantages high efficiency a small disturbance area and little impact on the lake bottom ecosystem and has broad application prospects in the control and management of endogenous pollutants in large shallow eutrophic lakes zhang et al 2021a 2021b 2021c 2021d lake currents and waves as the main hydrodynamic forces in shallow lakes interact with each other to affect the transport of substances in water de vicente et al 2010 joensuu et al 2018 zhu et al 2015 the relationship between sediment resuspension and hydrodynamic disturbance intensity has been widely studied over the years based on field observations of the great lakes in the united states lick 2008 showed that the concentration and diameter of resuspended sediment are related to the shear stress near the sediment water interface field observations in lake taihu show that when the wind speed is approximately 5 6 m s corresponding to a bottom velocity 0 1 m s a large amount of sediment resuspension occurs tang et al 2020 strong wind and wave disturbance will be conducive to the resuspension of lake bottom sediments and the strength of lake currents plays a key role in the transport process of materials according to the principle of deep trap technology the formation of a weak hydrodynamic environment or even a still water environment in the trap will be conducive to the sedimentation and storage of particles that migrate to the top of the trap therefore lake currents and waves are the main hydrodynamic factors that affect the collection of particles in the bottom trap however the relationship between lake currents and waves and the sediment deposition in the trap is still unclear and needs to be further explored the interaction between waves and lake currents not only controls and affects the process of sediment resuspension mixing and migration but also affects the changes in oxidation potential ph and dissolved oxygen in sediments further controlling the migration and transformation of nutrients and has a great impact on the release of nutrients from sediments chen et al 2017 yang et al 2017 in recent decades the relationship between hydrodynamics and water quality has attracted extensive attention studies have shown that hydrodynamic disturbance can affect water quality by affecting the release of nitrogen and phosphorus from sediments hu 2016 tang et al 2020 fan et al 2003 and the release rate of phosphorus is significantly positively correlated with the hydrodynamic disturbance strength li et al 2017 qin et al 2003 fan et al 2001 reported that the internal phosphorus load induced by resuspension was 8 10 times greater than the static release compared with phosphorus which exists mostly as inorganic particles in water nitrogen exhibits more complex responses to hydrodynamic variations reddy et al 1996 claimed that the resuspension fluxes of ammonia increased 10 fold compared with the diffusion flux recent research has found that the nitrogen content in shallow eutrophic lakes is significantly affected by algal migration shi et al 2022 after the construction of the trap inorganic particles and organic particles such as algae are continuously collected and stored in the trap driven by hydrodynamic force the nutrient content of the collected particles is a key index to evaluate the effectiveness of capturing pollutants in deep traps due to the weak hydrodynamic conditions in the trap the probability of resuspension of particles captured in the deep trap is reduced so the sediment that migrates to the trap under hydrodynamic action at different periods can be better stored however previous researchers have focused more on the ability of bottom traps to capture highly polluting sediments zhang et al 2021a 2021b and less attention has been given to the contribution of lake hydrodynamics to the ability of traps to capture sediments with high nutrient contents in this study lake chaohu a large shallow eutrophic lake frequently disturbed by wind and waves was selected as the research object based on previous research zhang et al 2021a 2021b the present study built seven traps at different bottom locations of lake chaohu according to the hydrodynamic field and nutrient distribution zhang et al 2021c 2021d the lake current outside the trap and the sediment deposition rate and sediment nutrients in the trap were observed and the waves in lake chaohu were calculated by using the wind wave model the objectives of this study were 1 to identify the influence characteristics of hydrodynamic seasonal differences on sediment capture effect in bottom trap 2 to establish the quantitative relationship between bottom trap sedimentation and hydrodynamic indexes 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was performed in lake chaohu in central anhui province china 117 16 54 117 51 46 e and 31 43 28 31 25 28 n this lake is a large

lake chaohu basin are 1063 mm and 16 1 c respectively peng et al 2021 since 1970 due to rapid socioeconomic development external pollution loadings have increased causing accelerated eutrophication and the growth of harmful algae and arousing widespread concern among scholars 2 2 data collection 2 2 1 sediment sampling and chemical analysis mechanical excavation was used to construct a lake bottom trap at the position shown in fig 1 the size of the trap was 5 m 5 m 3 m length width depth the details of the bottom trap location selected trap construction can be found in zhang et al 2021c 2021d after the construction of the bottom traps cc1 cc7 fig 1 sediment cores inside the traps were collected using 80 mm diameter 500 mm long core samplers rigo co ltd tokyo japan in april september

particle size d50 represents the corresponding particle size at a cumulative frequency of 50 2 2 2 hydrological and meteorological data after the construction of the bottom trap hydrology and meteorological data around the trap from november 2019 to december 2020 were collected including water quality flow velocity and wind field water quality data and flow velocity observation data were provided by the administration bureau of lake chaohu ablc water quality data were obtained from stationary buoys including water temperature wt dissolved oxygen do electrical conductivity ec ph tn and tp w1 w7 were the water quality measurement points near bottom traps cc1 cc7 which could approximately reflect the variation in surface quality around the traps fig 1 buoy data were recorded every 4 h flow velocity data were obtained using acoustic doppler current profilers adcps v1 v7 were the current measurement points near traps cc1 cc7 which could approximately reflect the continuous variation in lake current intensity around the traps velocity data were recorded by adcp every 0 4 m from the bottom to the surface with a total of 10 layers and the monitoring frequency was every 10 min in this study the vertical mean velocity u1 and bottom velocity u2 were selected for analysis from november 2019 to december 2020 the wave strength characteristics were determined through numerical swan model simulating waves nearshore experiments zhang and hu 2020 the temporal wind fields of the national meteorological information center cmdc https data cma cn at the hefei chaohu and lujiang meteorological stations in the chaohu lake basin were interpolated 2 3 sediment thickness and sedimentation rate to eliminate the influences of sediment disturbance and suspension caused by the trap construction the sedimentation rate of each trap was monitored one month after trap construction was completed and the efficiency of collecting suspended particles in each trap was accurately evaluated depth monitoring inside and outside the traps was to be carried out once a month however in february monitoring was not carried out due to the covid 19 epidemic in addition from june to august a major flood occurred in lake chaohu resulting in the water level increasing 3 4 m above the normal level the trap location markers were submerged during this time and could not be located thus interrupting monitoring the depth of the six fixed positions in the trap was monitored with a bathymetric rope four of these positions were located in the four corners of the bottom trap with the other two located in the middle of the trap at the same time the water depth outside the trap was monitored the depth of the trap was calculated as the difference in water depth between the inside and outside the trap and the sediment thickness and sedimentation rate in each month were calculated by using the monitored values in different months the formula is as follows 1 s h 1 h 2 h 3 h 4 2 v s t h1 and h2 are the water depths m inside and outside the trap respectively obtained by using the bathymetry rope in the previous time h3 and h4 are the water depths m inside and outside the trap respectively obtained by using the bathymetry rope in the current time and the water depth measurement accuracy is 0 001 m s is the thickness m of sediment deposited in the bottom trap calculated during the two probes t is the number of days d during the two exploration periods and v is the sediment deposition rate m d during the period 2 4 inversion of sedimentation period the sediment columnar samples in different traps were collected in the field three times and the physical and chemical indexes of the mud samples were determined by laboratory experiments after field segmentation with a thickness of 0 05 m however the siltation period corresponding to each 0 05 m mud sample and the changes in lake flow and waves within the corresponding period are not certain and it is difficult to sample in the field during inclement weather it is difficult to timely monitor the changes in sediment captured by hydrodynamic disturbances of different intensities therefore to explore the influence of lake currents and waves on the nutrients in sediments captured by bottom traps it is necessary to invert the period of sediment deposition in the traps 2 4 1 mc correction the surface sediments of shallow lakes are frequently disturbed by lake currents and waves resulting in high mc the particles that are resuspended due to the disturbance are transported to the upper part of the bottom trap by the lake current and are then captured in the trap therefore most of the sediments collected in the trap are sediments with high mc however due to the continuous compaction of sediments trapped in the bottom trap the mc gradually decreases from top to bottom with increasing siltation thickness therefore under the condition of the same hydrodynamic disturbance and siltation thickness the lower sediments with lower mc in the trap need a longer siltation period than the upper sediments with higher mc therefore the mc should be used to correct the sediment thickness before inversion of the sediment deposition period since the surface sediments in the bottom trap are newly captured particles it can be considered that they have not been compacted so the mc of the surface sediments is taken as the benchmark for the correction of the lower sediments the equation is as follows 3 s correction mc 0 mc i s i where scorrection is the corrected sedimentation rate mc0 is the mc corresponding to surface sediments li is the sampling sediment thickness of layer i and mci is the mc of sediment at layer i 2 4 2 inversion of sediment deposition period the mc of the surface sediments collected three times in different periods 2020 1 12 2020 4 13 2020 4 14 2020 9 18 2020 9 19 2020 12 23 was used to correct the siltation thickness of the lower sediments in different periods and the siltation thickness of the surface sediments did not need to be corrected in addition due to the possibility of repeated sampling for three samplings that is with the decrease in the depth in the trap the deposition rate decreases and the sampling depth is greater than the deposition thickness of the sediment in the trap during the current period the sediment data of the second sampling overlap so this part of the data needs to be eliminated and only the sediment data deposited in the current period are retained after determining sediment deposition thickness in three periods of different bottom traps and correcting based on the mc according to the model constructed in the supplementary text s1 the daily sediment deposition rate m d in different traps can be calculated by substituting the daily mean of the selected hydrodynamic factors into the model so the daily sediment deposition thickness m can be determined after the accumulation of the daily deposition thickness in the three periods the accumulated value was compared with the actual deposition thickness of the three periods the model with the smallest difference among the results was retained and the ratio of the actual deposition thickness to the accumulated value was used to correct the daily deposition thickness the collected sediment column samples were arranged in different traps on the time scale and the column samples were divided into n parts according to the cut thickness corrected by mc correspondingly the deposition thickness obtained from the model is also divided into n parts since the hydrodynamic factors applied in the model are continuous on the time scale and the sediment deposition thickness in the trap has been determined every day the time period corresponding to each part of the sediment calculated by the model can be determined that is the deposition period of each sediment in the trap 2 4 3 particle size validation particle size is one of the basic physical characteristics of sediments and is controlled by the dynamic conditions of transport and deposition processes and is closely related to the sedimentary environment dalu et al 2020 tang et al 2019 particles disturbed by wind waves and transported to the top of the trap by lake currents are constantly collected in the trap according to stokes law sediment distribution is strongly affected by sediment density and hydrodynamic conditions guo et al 2018 schreiner et al 2013 wang et al 2015 particles are hydrodynamically sorted during transport causing particles with lower buoyancy larger density and coarser particle size to settle rapidly while particles with higher buoyancy lower density and finer particle size will undergo further transport bao et al 2018 wakeham et al 2009 theoretically under the influence of lake currents and waves outside the trap during different periods the size of particles settling in the trap will be significantly different that is when the wind waves are strong the particle size captured in the trap will be relatively large and when the wind waves are weak the particle size captured in the trap will be relatively small therefore the internal relationship between particle size data and hydrodynamic factors in different periods can be established to verify the inversion results in the period of sediment deposition in the trap as a representative parameter of particle size the median particle size represents the characteristics of the overall particle size after inversion of the sediment deposition period the specific deposition period corrected for mc of sampled and segmented sediments in each trap was obtained the average values of lake currents and waves in the corresponding siltation period of each layer of sediment were correlated with the median particle size of sediment and the hydrodynamic factors with significant correlations with different particle size data were determined correlation analysis was carried out between the average value of lake current u1 u2 the kinetic energy of u1 eu1 the kinetic energy of u2 eu2 and wave wavelength water depth l d l significant wave height hs the potential energy ew and the median particle size and particle sizes of 4 μm 4 8 μm 8 16 μm 16 32 μm 32 64 μm and greater than 64 μm of sediments in the sedimentation period of each layer of sediment then the hydrodynamic factors that were significantly correlated with different particle size data were determined linear regression analysis was conducted between the selected hydrodynamic factors and particle size to obtain the influence of hydrodynamic factors on different particle sizes 2 5 statistical analysis excel and spss software were used for statistical analysis of the data based on the nonparametric test method kruskal wallis kw which was used to test the spatiotemporal differences in sediment deposition rate sediment physicochemical factors water physicochemical factors lake current and waves in the nearby water and the significance levels were p 0 01 extremely significant p 0 05 significant and p greater than 0 05 nonsignificant the relationship between the sedimentation rate in the trap and the lake current and wave was established by linear regression and multiple stepwise regression analysis according to the inversion results of the sediment deposition period in the bottom trap the average value of the lake current wave and water quality data during the deposition period corresponding to each layer of sediment was calculated pearson correlation analysis was used to evaluate the relationships between sediment physicochemical factors tn tp chla mc om and lake current u1 u2 eu1 eu2 wave l d l hs ew and water physicochemical factors wt ph do ec ntu tp tn near the trap redundancy analysis rda was used to explore the effects of lake currents waves and water body physicochemical factors on sediment physicochemical indicators to further clarify the effect of sediment nutrients in different bottom traps of lake currents and waves trap cc3 with strong waves in winter and spring and bottom traps with strong lake currents in summer were selected regression analysis was carried out between these traps and the relationships between the sediment nutrients collected in the trap and the waves and lake currents were obtained 3 results 3 1 relationship between sedimentation rate and hydrodynamic factors 3 1 1 sedimentation rates the temporal and spatial variation in the sediment deposition rate in different traps are shown in fig 2 the results showed that the sedimentation rates of the traps in lake chaohu obviously differed spatially and temporally p 0 05 on average throughout the year the sedimentation rates exhibited the following order v cc1 v cc2 v cc3 v cc4 v cc5 v cc7 v cc6 the sedimentation rates inside the traps in western lake chaohu were the highest the trap depths of cc6 and cc7 rapidly decreased to 0 81 m and 1 77 m respectively in april as the trap depth decreases the hydrodynamic strength in the trap increases which weakens the collection ability of the trap and affects the sedimentation rate comparison of the sedimentation rates of different traps among different periods of the year revealed that the sedimentation rates were high in summer and autumn from april to september in contrast to those of traps cc6 and cc7 which were in the centre of the lake most of the sedimentation rates in the five nearshore traps were above 0 004 m d in winter and spring the sedimentation rates in the five nearshore traps were 0 002 m d except cc3 the sediment rate higher from january to march reaching 0 0114 m d than in other periods which was mainly the result of different hydrodynamic intensities during different periods 3 1 2 hydrodynamic variations according to the results of field observations of lake currents near different bottom traps of lake chaohu during the observation period u1 0 0006 0 559 m s mean 0 035 m s and u2 0 0008 0 528 m s mean 0 061 m s outside the traps varied widely fig s1 which reflected different hydrodynamic intensities u2 was significantly larger than u1 p 0 01 the velocity of the waters near the bottom trap of western lake chaohu was the highest in summer and the velocity in southeastern lake chaohu was the highest in winter the wind waves near the bottom traps cc1 cc7 were larger in winter and spring and smaller in autumn spatially the wind waves at cc6 and cc7 in the middle of the lake were relatively large while the wind waves near the shore were relatively small mainly due to the influences of topography water depth and the masking of wind by the shoreline among them the wind waves in the water near the bottom trap near the shore of eastern lake chaohu were larger than those near the bottom trap near the shore of western lake chaohu due to the paper length limitation details of lake current flow direction and wind wave data near each bottom trap are provided in supplementary text s2 3 1 3 relationship between sedimentation rate and hydrodynamic factors based on the sedimentation rate in the cc1 cc5 traps and the lake current and wave near the traps the regression analysis showed that the sedimentation rate was positively correlated with the hydrodynamic p 0 01 fig 3 u1 u2 eu1 and eu2 explain 30 17 34 and 23 of the variation in sedimentation rates respectively indicating that lake current strength outside the trap can significantly affect the sediment deposition effect in traps with the enhancement of lake current energy the amount of sediment resuspension will increase and the sediment amounts settled into traps will also increase with the lake current transport resulting in the acceleration of sedimentation rate from the perspective of waves l d accounts for 20 of the sedimentation rate indicating that an increase in l d will be beneficial to sediment deposition in the trap since sediment capture in the trap is a process of continuous accumulation there is a positive correlation between sediment deposition and cumulative energy of lake currents and waves eu sum ew sum the regression analysis results of the monthly sedimentation thickness in traps cc1 cc5 and the cumulative energy showed that there were significant positive correlations p 0 01 except ew sum p greater than 0 05 fig 4 eu1 sum and eu2 sum can explain 74 and 60 sedimentation thickness variation respectively indicating that the enhancement of lake currents will significantly increase the sediment deposition amounts in the traps according to the above analysis there is a positive correlation between sediment deposition and lake currents and waves but a single hydrodynamic factor accounts for 40 of the sedimentation rate which is relatively low therefore to improve the interpretation degree the key hydrodynamic influencing factors should be considered together the results of multiple stepwise regression analysis between sedimentation rate and l d l hs u1 u2 eu1 and eu2 are shown in table 1 compared with the single factor regression results of hydrodynamic factors the model combining different influencing factors can explain the change in sedimentation rate in the trap better to different degrees and the relationship constructed by cc3 in the bottom trap can explain 85 of the variation 3 2 inversion of sediment deposition period 3 2 1 reconstruction of sediment mc to quantitatively characterize the relationship between sediment mc in the trap and sediment depth and to obtain the variation characteristics of sediments in each trap along the entire vertical profile stratified monitoring data of sediment mc in cc1 cc2 cc3 and cc5 on september 28 and december 23 2020 were used and the relation between mc and stratification depth was established many studies have shown that the mc of lake sediments decreases with the depth of sediments as a power function lewis et al 2009 chapra and reckhow 1993 therefore in the fitting process the average value of two observations in each 0 05 m layer was calculated first and then approximately 80 of the data points in the upper layer were used to establish the power function relationship and approximately 20 of the data in the lower layer were used to verify the model accuracy the specific results are shown in fig 5 according to the fitting results the deterministic coefficients of the fitting process of sediment mc in traps cc1 cc3 and cc5 with the change in depth are all above 0 70 which means that the mc shows a consistent decreasing power function with the change in depth the cc2 fitting results were relatively poor with a certainty coefficient of 0 54 from the verification results the root mean square error rmse between the simulated and measured sediment mc in the four traps ranged from 0 008 to 0 068 with an average of 0 034 the specific results are shown in table 2 3 2 2 mc correction basically as the sediment thickness increases the mc shows a trend of first decreasing and then fluctuating the mc of the surface sediments in the trap is 1 209 times higher than that of the bottom layer on average indicating that the compaction in the trap is obvious due to the paper length limitations the specific correction results are given in the supplementary text s3 according to the fitting results of dry matter thickness and sediment thickness corrected by mc fig s3 the deterministic coefficients of traps cc1 cc2 cc3 and cc5 are all above 0 94 indicating that the change in sediment thickness corrected by mc can better reflect the change in dry matter thickness 3 2 3 inversion of sedimentation period according to the stepwise multiple regression model in table 1 the accumulative values of daily sediment deposition thickness calculated by different models during the three periods from january 12 to april 13 april 13 to september 18 and september 19 to december 23 are compared with the actual sediment deposition thickness in different bottom traps of the three periods after correction the results show that the difference between the deposition thickness obtained from models 1 6 and the deposition thickness is small which the rmse ranged from 0 91 to 10 9 with an average of 4 79 after correction with the actual deposition thickness the daily sediment deposition thickness of different traps obtained from models 1 6 is shown in fig 6 although model 1 is suitable for different bottom traps models 2 6 with a higher coefficient r2 of determination and smaller difference between the results and actual deposition thickness are preferred for use in the inversion during the deposition period the specific calculation results are limited by the paper length please refer to the supplementary text s4 for details the sediment deposition rate data of cc1 cc2 cc3 and cc5 in the year were used to quantitatively characterize the relationship between the sediment deposition rate calculated from dry matter thickness and hydrodynamic factors u1 u2 eu1 eu2 in the trap the specific results are shown in fig s5 according to the fitting results the certainty coefficients of the fitting process with the variation in hydrodynamic factors are all above 0 50 which means that the sediment deposition rate in the trap shows a good linear trend of increasing with the increase in lake current intensity 3 2 4 particle size verification after the variation characteristics of sediment particle size in different bottom traps were determined see supplementary text s5 the intrinsic relationship between sediment particle size in bottom traps and hydrodynamic factors was established the correlation analysis between sediment particle size and hydrodynamic factors in different bottom traps is shown in table s3 the results showed that the median particle size and 16 32 μm particle size proportion were significantly positively correlated with l d l hs and ew p 0 05 4 μm and 4 8 μm particle size proportions were significantly negatively correlated with l d l hs and ew p 0 05 and 8 16 μm particle size proportions were significantly negatively correlated with u1 u2 eu1 and eu2 p 0 05 indicating that sediment particle size in the trap was significantly correlated with the strength of the lake current and waves outside the trap linear regression analysis was performed on the hydrodynamic factors and sediment particle size data with significant correlation fig s7 although the coefficient of determination of the relationship between the hydrodynamic factors and particle size data was low r 2 0 2 they all passed the significance test p 0 05 indicating that the selected hydrodynamic factors can significantly affect the particle size of the sediment captured in the trap but are not the only determinants the results show that with increasing l d l hs and ew outside the trap the proportion of small sized particles in the trap decreases and the proportion of large sized particles increases with the enhancement of the lake current the proportion of particles in the 8 16 μm size class in the trap gradually decreased indicating that with the enhancement of the lake current and waves outside the trap the particle size of the sediment captured in the trap showed a changing trend from fine to coarse based on the linear regression analysis of particle size and hydrodynamic factors ew has the highest degree of explanation explaining 15 of the variation in 16 32 μm class in traps according to the change in the 16 32 μm particle size of sediments in traps cc1 cc5 and ew during the corresponding deposition period the variation trend was similar the coincidence degree of traps cc1 and cc2 in some periods was relatively high and the coincidence degree of trap cc3 was relatively poor in general the inversion period was basically consistent with the actual deposition period fig s8 3 3 effects of hydrodynamic strength on sediment nutrients according to the above results the hydrodynamic force can directly affect the nutrient content in the trap by affecting the sedimentation rate in the trap at the same time under the influence of wind waves and lake currents on the one hand the disturbance will release sediment nutrients and thus affect the nutrient content in the water on the other hand the transport of lake currents and the mixing of wind waves will cause the mixing of physical and chemical indexes in different spatial water bodies of shallow lakes the change in physical and chemical properties in water will further affect the change in the properties of the particles captured in the trap that is the hydrodynamic force has an indirect effect on the particles in the trap by affecting the change in nutrients in the water due to the paper length limitation details of the vertical variation of sediment nutrients collected in the trap and the changes of water nutrients near the trap are provided in the supplementary text s6 therefore correlation analysis was conducted on hydrodynamic strength indexes lake currents and wind waves and water nutrient indexes in different periods according to the deposition period established above and the results are shown in fig 8a in general the dynamic indexes related to waves will have negative effects on wt tn and tp and positive effects on do and ph indicating that weak wind wave conditions will be conducive to the formation of low wt low do and low ph environments the hydrodynamic indexes related to lake currents had positive effects on wt turbidity tn and tp and negative effects on do and ph indicating that a strong lake current process would be beneficial to wt mixing sediment suspension and nitrogen and phosphorus nutrient release the flow velocity index tn tp and turbidity in water were further analysed as shown in fig 7 the results show that tp r 2 0 223 p 0 001 and turbidity r 2 0 467 p 0 001 increase significantly with increasing flow velocity indicating that when the lake current is strong hydrodynamic disturbance will cause resuspension of highly polluted sediments in the surface layer resulting in a significant increase in turbidity in the water outside the trap and further leading to an increase in phosphorus content in the water according to the correlation analysis of sediment nutrients captured in the trap with hydrodynamic indexes lake current and wave intensity and water physical and chemical factors during the sedimentation period of each layer of sediment in the trap fig 8 a the results showed that the sediment nutrients captured in different traps were significantly positively correlated with the contents of om and chla in the sediment p 0 01 in particular the correlation coefficient between tn and om was as high as 0 839 indicating that they are closely related tn and om in the sediments were positively correlated with the lake current u1 u2 eu1 eu2 with correlation coefficients ranging from 0 243 to 0 326 p 0 01 and negatively correlated with waves l d l hs with correlation coefficients ranging from 0 331 to 0 249 p 0 01 in addition the contents of tn tp and om in the sediment captured in the traps were positively correlated with the tn and tp in the water outside the traps p 0 01 and negatively correlated with ph and do the contents of tn and om in the sediment were positively correlated with the wt outside the trap while the contents of tp in the sediment were negatively correlated with the wt rda was further used to analyse the influence of lake current waves and water physicochemical factors explanatory variables outside the trap on sediment nutrients response variables captured in the trap the first two axes explained 33 4 of the variation in sediment nutrients in the traps with reflecting good results fig 8b the rda results showed that the nitrogen and phosphorus contents in sediments were closely related to the nitrogen and phosphorus contents in the lake on the one hand the enhancement of lake currents could increase nitrogen and phosphorus contents in water bodies and thus positively affect the nitrogen and phosphorus contents captured in the traps on the other hand intensified lake currents promoted the increase in om content captured in the traps and further increased the nutrient content of sediments in the traps to further analyse the contribution of lake currents and waves to the nutrient content of sediments captured by the bottom traps the linear regression analysis results of tn om and waves wave intensity was only characterized by l d here in the sediments in all bottom traps and in trap cc3 in winter and spring period of strong wind and waves showed that with the increase in l d the content of tn and om in sediments captured in all bottom traps showed a decreasing trend tn r 2 0 09 p 0 05 n 125 om r 2 0 07 p 0 05 n 125 but the tn and om content of sediments captured in trap cc3 showed an upward trend in winter and spring tn r 2 0 31 p 0 05 n 16 om r 2 0 27 p 0 05 n 16 indicating that stronger waves are beneficial to the increase in tn and om content in sediments in trap cc3 in winter and spring fig 9 the linear regression analysis results of tn tp and om of sediments in all bottom traps and in summer bottom traps and bottom lake currents showed that the bottom flow velocity was positively correlated with the contents of tn tp and om captured in the bottom traps tn r 2 0 06 p 0 01 n 125 tp r 2 0 08 p 0 01 n 125 om r 2 0 08 p 0 01 n 125 fig 9 the interpretation of the nutrient content of sediments captured in the bottom trap by the bottom lake current in summer was significantly improved tn r 2 0 23 p 0 01 n 57 tp r 2 0 28 p 0 01 n 57 om r 2 0 28 p 0 05 n 125 indicating that the strong bottom lake current in summer was conducive to the increase in tn tp and om content in the sediment deposited in the bottom trap 3 4 assessment of the total amount of sediment captured by bottom traps based on the hydrodynamic index according to the relationship of models 1 6 in table 1 and using the hydrodynamic indicators of a complete year in 2020 as variables it can be estimated that the thicknesses of sediments that can be captured by cc1 to cc5 are 1 91 m 1 68 m 1 93 m 1 09 m and 1 68 m respectively fig 10 in general the bottom traps in the western lake chaohu area collected the largest annual total amount of pollutants among which the annual total amount of tn and tp collected in trap cc1 was 68 53 kg and 19 89 kg respectively and the annual total amount of tn and tp collected in trap cc2 was 44 59 kg and 14 8 kg respectively followed by cc3 tn 44 03 kg tp 13 21 kg 4 discussion 4 1 influences of currents and waves on deposition rate lake currents and waves are the main factors affecting the sediment deposition rate in the bottom trap of lake chaohu and there are obvious differences in sediment deposition characteristics under different dynamic conditions in different positions of the trap generally in shallow lakes under the action of a stable wind field the energy transferred from wind energy to waves gradually increases and the wave action gradually becomes stronger when the wind energy increases to a certain intensity the intensity of wind waves will not increase babanin 2006 wu et al 2016 especially in areas with a long fetch and shallow water depths turbulence caused by wind disturbance and waves will lead to a large amount of sediment resuspension and suspended particles will be transported to the top of the trap by lake currents and then settle into the trap due to gravity theoretically cc6 in the central western area of the lake and cc7 in the central eastern area of the lake located in the open lake area would be favourable locations for constructing the bottom trap the results also showed that the waves and lake currents at the centre of the lake were strong which was conducive to capturing a large number of particles in the trap however the sediment deposition rates in traps cc6 and cc7 were significantly lower than those in the other bottom traps and the sediment deposition thicknesses in traps cc6 and cc7 were only 0 107 m and 0 211 m respectively after the observation this is mainly due to the large thickness of light sediments in the centre of lake chaohu zhang et al 2021d which makes it difficult to form a bottom trap with a stable sidewall although the sidewall fixed material is also considered to be used in actual operation due to frequent hydrodynamic disturbance the bottom mud quickly flows into the trap through the bottom of the material which reduces the depth of the trap and weakens the ability of the bottom trap to collect sediment in addition the decrease in the weak hydrodynamic space in the trap also leads to an increase in sediment resuspension probability during the observation period the wind waves were larger in winter and spring fig s2 from january and march the highest sedimentation rate 0 0114 m d was observed for trap cc3 which was related to the location of this trap in the nearshore area on the south side of lake chaohu under the influence of the prevailing northwest wind in winter the wave intensity at trap cc3 was relatively large the sediments were prone to resuspension under the action of wind waves and the bottom offshore lake current transported a large amount of suspended sediments to cc3 forming conditions favourable for the trap to collect lake bottom sediments in summer the dominant wind direction of lake chaohu is the southeast wind trap cc3 is located in a region with a short fetch small wind waves large water depth small force of wind waves on the lake bottom and small resuspension amount of lake bottom sediments therefore the sedimentation rate in the trap decreases at this stage in addition the sediment deposition in trap cc3 reached more than 1 m in april and the reduction in the trap depth weakened the collection capacity of the bottom trap which was also one of the reasons for the decrease in the sedimentation rate in the later observation period in the bottom trap near the shore of lake chaohu all the traps except cc3 are in the high speed deposition stage in summer and the deposition rate is more than 0 004 m d in winter and spring the deposition rate is lower than 0 002 m d mainly because the positions of cc1 cc2 cc4 and cc5 under the prevailing wind in winter are affected by the shoreline and the fetch is short therefore the average hs is relatively small and the wave action is weak which is not conducive to the capture of particles in the trap theoretically under the action of the prevailing southeast wind in summer the wind and waves in the northwestern part of lake chaohu are relatively large and the bottom is prone to resuspension however field observations showed that the lake current outside the bottom trap is relatively large and the average hs is relatively small bachmann et al 2000 showed that horizontal movement on the lakebed was sufficient to resuspend sediment only when the water depth was less than half the wavelength due to the energy dissipation in the vertical diffusion process the turbulent energy reaching the lake bottom sediment varies with the water depth etemad shahidi and imberger 2001 zhu et al 2021 in summer the water depth of lake chaohu is relatively large the effect of waves on the bottom of the lake is small and the influence of the bottom lake current gradually appears zhang et al 2021a the sediment deposition rate in the trap increased significantly with the strengthening of the lake current fig 3 the sediment deposition thickness in cc1 was close to 1 m from may to september and the bottom trap was located near the northwest shore of lake chaohu in summer the bottom lake current had a high velocity and the main direction was southwest transporting a large amount of light sediments to cc1 trap cc2 is located in the southwestern coastal area of western lake chaohu where a certain width of lake current accumulation exists zhang et al 2021d in summer the bottom lake current outside trap cc2 is large and the main direction of the bottom lake current is southeast which transports sediments from areas with a large thickness of light sediment to cc2 forming conditions favourable for the bottom trap to collect lake bottom sediments cc4 and cc5 are located in the nearshore areas in northeastern lake chaohu and central lake chaohu respectively and both have a certain width of lake current gathering area which is limited by the influence of the shoreline therefore although the thickness of the light sediment at these two bottom traps is large the effect of waves and lake currents is relatively small so the sediment deposition rate in the trap is lower than that of cc1 cc3 it should be noted that since the study observed one lake and lake chaohu was investigated before the constructed of bottom trap it was found that there was little difference in the degree of sediment compactness at the bottom so the sediment compactness was not considered as a variable but before this technique applied in other lakes the bottom sediment concentration should be observed and as a factor to analyse the ability of bottom traps to capture sediment in the shallow eutrophic lake 4 2 dynamic response of sediment nutrients to lake hydrodynamics compared with sediment deposition in traps the response of sediment nutrients to lake hydrodynamic dynamics is more complex according to the changes in hydrodynamic forces water nutrients and sediment nutrients in the trap it was suspected that hydrodynamic forces have a significant direct impact on the nutrient content of water with an especially close relationship between lake currents and tp and the turbidity of water fig 7 in shallow lakes when the hydrodynamic disturbance is strong a large amount of sediment mixture is instantly suspended into the overlying water resulting in an increase in water turbidity since tp in water is mainly composed of particulate phosphorus an increase in the concentration of suspended particulate matter will also lead to an increase in tp søndergaard et al 2013 dissolved inorganic nitrogen and organic nitrogen are the main forms of nitrogen in water wu et al 2016 therefore the increases in inorganic particle concentrations caused by hydrodynamic perturbations make a small contribution to tn concentrations in water bodies fig 7 changes in tn and tp in the water body convey a signal that water body nutrient content increases with sediment resuspension which has also been confirmed in other studies ding et al 2018 zhu et al 2004 wu et al 2012 studied lake taihu and found that with the increase in suspended particulate matter tn and tp in the water body increased rapidly but with the end of the disturbance the particulate matter resettled and the nitrogen and phosphorus contents in the water body decreased rapidly indicating that sediment resuspension mainly affected the changes in tn and tp in water by affecting granular nitrogen and phosphorus the resuspended high nitrogen and phosphorus particles are transported to the top of the trap by the lake current and then captured by the bottom trap therefore the change in nitrogen and phosphorus contents in the water near the trap is significantly related to the nitrogen and phosphorus contents in the sediment collected in the trap the above analysis showed that the nitrogen and phosphorus contents of sediments collected in different traps of lake chaohu were significantly correlated with om especially the correlation coefficient between tn and om which reached 0 866 fig 8a qin et al 2007 found that dissolved inorganic nitrogen accounted for 83 4 of tn in a study of rivers entering the lake while organic nitrogen accounted for 98 8 of tn in the lake sediments inorganic nitrogen in the lake would be buried in the sediments in the form of biological debris after being absorbed by organisms therefore the main source of tn captured in different traps of lake chaohu was biodeposition algae are one of the main reservoirs of organic nitrogen and phosphorus in shallow eutrophic lakes and their vertical distribution in water is mainly affected by hydrodynamic disturbance and meteorological biological and water temperature parameters cao et al 2006 lake hydrodynamic disturbance will drive the vertical migration of algae which will lead to the transfer of particulate nitrogen in the water body the results of this study showed that strong waves were beneficial to the increase in tn and om contents in the sediments captured in the trap cc3 in winter and spring fig 9 in winter and spring under the action of the dominant northwest wind of lake chaohu algae gathered downwind and the strong wave disturbance brought algae to the bottom water and transported them into the trap through the bottom offshore lake current which led to the increase in nutrient content in trap cc3 the strong bottom lake current in summer is conducive to the increase in nitrogen and om contents in most sediments deposited in the bottom trap of lake chaohu fig 9 in summer lake chaohu is dominated by microcystis and microcystis cells can use the presence of gas vesicles and changes in intracellular carbohydrates to regulate buoyancy and change the algal cell density in the overlying water in response to light and hydrodynamic perturbations paerl et al 2011 under the action of southeast winds in summer the algae of lake chaohu mostly gathered in the western lake chaohu area so the algae biomass in the waters near traps cc1 and cc2 was relatively high as these traps formed favourable conditions for the collection of algae in summer the lake current is strong and the turbidity in the water body increases while the tn content decreases on the one hand due to the high wt in summer the denitrification effect is strong on the other hand the algae are in a period of high growth and high sedimentation in summer and organic nitrogen in the water body decreases with the sedimentation of algae fan et al 2019 zhou et al 2016 at this time under the action of strong lake currents large amounts of algae and organic debris were transported into the trap resulting in a significant increase in the content of nitrogen and om in the sediments in addition the increase in wt in summer will reduce the viscosity of water with the decrease in viscosity the resistance of water to vertical migration will also decrease thus promoting the upward and downward migration of mobile bloom cyanobacteria in the water column all of the above provide favourable conditions for bottom traps to capture pollutants with high nitrogen and phosphorus contents in summer therefore the contents of tn and om are generally high in the bottom trap in summer with the highest contents in the traps in the western lake chaohu area in autumn and winter the lake current and wave action were weak and algae growth was inhibited due to the lower temperature at this time so the nitrogen content of the sediment captured in the traps decreased the phosphorus content of the sediments captured in the traps was synchronized with the changes in nitrogen content in most periods but the phosphorus content of the sediments captured in the traps decreased slightly in summer which may be mainly attributed to the release of sedimentary phosphorus due to the higher wt in summer yang et al 2020 showed that the phosphorus release flux from sediments in western lake chaohu in summer was 74 times that in winter according to the above analysis the main reason for the high sediment nitrogen content in the trap in summer may be the capture of a large amount of algae the results of this study showed that the sediment chla content captured in the trap peaks in spring and summer but it is lower in summer than in spring fig s9 chla content is known to be a useful indicator for predicting phytoplankton growth status otten et al 2012 the main reason for the lower chla content in the trap in summer may be that the hypoxic environment accelerated the degradation of fresh algae at the sediment water interface leading to the destruction of chloroplast structure due to the high temperature in summer ashraf and harris 2013 nong et al 2021 affected by the difference of hydrodynamic conditions there are significant differences in the capacity of collecting highly polluted flume in the bottom trap at different spatial locations in lake chaohu according to the difference of hydrodynamic spatial distribution in lake chaohu the key to the correct utilization of this technology is to correctly arrange the bottom trap scheme and maximize the capacity of collecting highly polluted flume in the bottom trap 4 3 environmental effect of hydrodynamics at the bottom trap according to the above analysis there are significant spatial and temporal differences between lake currents and waves in lake chaohu and these differences also lead to significant differences in the amount of sediment captured in the trap lake currents and waves also drive changes in the spatial and temporal distribution of algae which affects the nutrient content of sediments captured in the trap after the construction of the bottom trap a relatively static hydrodynamic environment was formed inside the trap which differed from the varying hydrodynamic environment outside the trap and it was easy for highly polluted sediments such as algae to be captured in the trap the strong wind waves in spring mainly affect the capture of sediments by bottom traps in the southeastern coastal zone of lake chaohu in summer the lake current is strong which can affect the accelerated sedimentation of particles in the bottom traps throughout lake at this time the strong lake current and the increase in algal biomass in the overlying water accelerated the capture of algae in the bottom trap in the downwind direction that is the increase in algae content in the trap in the western lake chaohu area therefore combined with the annual total amount of pollutants collected in the trap it is recommended to build bottom traps in areas with strong hydrodynamic forces and easy accumulation of algae this will not only lead to an increase in the sedimentation rate but also increase the content of nutrients captured in the sediment that is increase the probability of capturing algae the current understanding of algal blooms is that a large amount of algae has already accumulated in the water column before the formation of algal blooms when the water environment conditions are suitable these algae will instantly rise to the water surface to form algal blooms therefore the construction of bottom traps at the bottom of the lake will capture the algae present in the water column reducing the material basis of blooms algal cells and reducing the risk of blooms previous authors have concluded that the release of sediment nutrients has a significant impact on the concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus in the water column and that the weak hydrodynamic disturbance in bottom traps can reduce the loss of nitrogen and phosphorus from the sediment zhu et al 2021 it should be noted that chla may be degraded in the sediments captured in the deep trap in summer resulting in lower content under the action of bacteria chla is continuously degraded into pheophytin and then tends to be stable therefore the addition of pheophytin indicators can be considered in follow up studies to comprehensively evaluate the algae collection in the sediments in bottom traps 5 conclusion based on the data of lake currents waves sediment deposition rate and physical and chemical indexes of water and sediment in the waters near different bottom traps the hydrodynamic variation characteristics of the waters near the bottom traps at different positions and the sedimentation process in the traps and its variation characteristics were expounded the response of sediment deposition rates to changes in lake currents and waves were analysed the relationship between hydrodynamic factors and sediment deposition was established and the response law of sediment nutrient content captured in deep traps to hydrodynamic changes was discussed the following conclusions were obtained 1 the action time of lake currents and waves on the capture of sediment in traps was not synchronized during the observation period strong wind waves in winter and spring accelerated the deposition of sediments in the traps in the southern nearshore area of eastern lake chaohu in summer with increasing water depth the effect of waves on lakebed sediments was small and the influence of lake currents gradually became apparent the lake current became the main dynamic factor for the rapid capture of highly polluted sediments in the bottom trap of western lake chaohu 2 lake currents and waves can explain more than 30 and 20 of the sediment deposition rate in the trap respectively the multiple stepwise linear regression model based on lake current and wave data can explain 37 6 of the sediment deposition rate and the model established by a single trap can explain more than 80 after the mc correction of the sediment deposition thickness in the trap the established quantitative relationship can better invert the sediment deposition process and obtain the deposition period of sediments with different thicknesses in the bottom trap according to the research this analytical method is proved to be feasible in the process of applying the obtained formula to other lakes it is necessary to adjust the formula and add or remove some variables to improve the applicability of the formula 3 the enhancement of lake currents can promote an increase in sediment nutrient content in most of the bottom traps while waves have a greater impact on the sediment nutrient content in the bottom traps near the south shore of eastern lake chaohu in winter and spring strong waves in the waters near the bottom trap in southeastern lake chaohu are beneficial to the increase in tn and om contents in the sediments in addition hydrodynamic indicators can be used to assess the total amount of sediment captured in bottom traps this study can provide a scientific basis for improving the ability of bottom traps to capture endogenous nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus in lakes thereby providing a theoretical basis for the application of bottom traps to the endogenous control of shallow lakes declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

2248,drought is a complex process that usually stems from aberrant climatic conditions such as precipitation deficits and temperature anomalies drought can pose a serious threat to vegetation growth which in turn regulates the process of drought evolution an in depth understanding of the interaction between drought and vegetation is crucial not only for drought monitoring but also for drought mitigation to this end this study divided the drought process into two sub processes 1 from physical dry conditions to drought stress and 2 from drought stress to vegetation destruction and introduced vegetation response factors to quantitatively depict the vegetation contributions in each sub process response factors of different vegetation types were decomposed respectively from temperature condition index tci soil moisture condition index smci and precipitation condition index pci in the first sub process and from vegetation condition index vci in the second sub process further this study proposed a novel integrated drought index named type response aided drought index tradi based on the response factors of different vegetation types vegetation response factors were applied to fine tune several commonly used single drought indices to verify their effectiveness and the proposed tradi was evaluated by comparing it with several combined indices including vegetation health index vhi scaled drought condition index sdci microwave integrated drought index midi and integrated drought monitoring index idmi moreover the tradi was qualitatively evaluated with the maps from u s drought monitor usdm in the 2011 and 2012 drought events across the continental united states conus our results showed that adjusted by vegetation response factors single drought indices as well as combined drought indices showed a closer correlation with the palmer drought severity index pdsi than their original forms indicating the strength of response factors in modifying existing indices furthermore the proposed tradi performed better than vhi sdci midi and idmi and was consistent with usdm in typical drought events this study provides a new perspective on understanding the process of drought affecting vegetation and highlights the importance of considering vegetation response in drought index establishment keywords drought monitoring drought stress vegetation response conus data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction drought is an unfavorable climate driven phenomenon that arises from prolonged precipitation deficits and temperature anomalies and has devastating effects on agriculture wu et al 2022 zhou et al 2020 ecology pozner et al 2022 economy espinosa tasón et al 2022 and human life kuil et al 2019 generally drought can be categorized into four major types i e meteorological agricultural hydrological and socio economic gu et al 2020 drought with insufficient precipitation for several weeks is classified as meteorological drought mirabbasi et al 2013 sharma et al 2022 while agricultural drought often occurs when meteorological drought is sustained and the soil moisture requirements of vegetation growth cannot be met son et al 2021 the occurrence of hydrological drought is judged by the drop in water levels of lakes reservoirs and rivers ding et al 2021 lai et al 2019 socio economic drought emphasizes the comprehensive impacts of the above drought types on industry and human living dikshit et al 2021 lee et al 2022 although drought is divided into four types the classification boundary of these four drought types is blurred this is because the drought event is a disaster process with slow onset prolonged duration and complex interaction with multiple factors such as the atmosphere vegetation soil and human beings pei et al 2018 especially the interaction between the physical stress of drought and the physiological response of vegetation is particularly complicated and has always been a hot issue in drought monitoring deng et al 2021 wang et al 2021b yin et al 2021 zhang and zhang 2019 up to now considerable efforts have been devoted to assessing the effects of drought stress on vegetation traditionally drought stress was obtained through tree ring chronologies and laboratory based measurements for example cook and jacoby 1977 explored the potential of tree ring records in revealing historical changes in temperature and precipitation bosabalidis and kofidis 2002 compared the leaf anatomical features of two olive cultivars and studied their different characteristics of drought response clauw et al 2015 analyzed growth related phenotypes of six arabidopsis and evaluated their adaption under mild drought conditions mcgregor et al 2021 investigated the drought vulnerability of trees with different heights and leaf drought tolerance these studies can finely characterize drought induced vegetation destruction at the plant leaf and even cellular level but cannot achieve continuous monitoring of drought dynamics given that the drought stress on vegetation is caused by insufficient precipitation and abnormal evapotranspiration some studies proposed station based indices to monitor the surrounding physical conditions of vegetation such as precipitation temperature and soil moisture content in different soil layers rather than directly monitoring the plants themselves for instance palmer 1965 proposed the palmer drought severity index pdsi based upon a physical water balance model by using precipitation and surface temperature data the pdsi is one of the most classic indices in drought monitoring and has been used for more than 50 years based on the asymmetric frequency distribution of precipitation mckee et al 1993 developed the standardized precipitation index spi the spi was recommended as a standard meteorological index by the world meteorological organization wmo and has been widely accepted in measuring the intensity of precipitation deficit hayes et al 2011 furthermore the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei modified the spi by incorporating the information on potential evapotranspiration vicente serrano et al 2010 although the site based gauge is accurate and can be considered as ground truth the sparse spatial distribution and high maintenance cost of meteorological stations make it unsuitable for high resolution and large scale applications yoon et al 2020 zhang et al 2017a due to the development of satellite based earth observation the drought impact on vegetation can be gauged indirectly through the retrieval of surrounding environmental factors or directly through the vegetation index yin et al 2021 zhong et al 2021 in the early stage of drought monitoring researchers constructed many single indices to focus on a specific aspect of drought the temperature condition index tci and vegetation condition index vci were developed by kogan 1995 based on the satellite imagery from the advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr to respectively monitor thermal anomalies and drought induced vegetation changes in the continental united states conus rhee et al 2010 introduced the precipitation condition index pci by using data from the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm satellite zhang and jia 2013 derived the soil moisture condition index smci from the advanced microwave scanning radiometer eos amsr e and applied it to meteorological drought monitoring in northern china nevertheless drought has multi faceted effects and its multidimensional characteristics cannot be fully reflected through a single index aghakouchak et al 2015 to solve this many combined indices were developed kogan 1995 integrated vci and tci into the vegetation health index vhi through linear weight allocation rhee et al 2010 derived the scaled drought condition index sdci by linearly combining the vci tci and pci zhang and jia 2013 blended tci pci and smci into the microwave integrated drought index midi in addition to linear combination some other studies are more objective by using the principal component analysis pca to integrate indices relevant examples can be easily found in recent publications such as the synthesized drought index sdi du et al 2013 the station enabled geographically independent integrated drought index giidi station jiao et al 2019 and the integrated drought monitoring index idmi arun kumar et al 2021 compared with single indices combined indices have more advantages in comprehensively characterizing vegetation dynamics and vegetation surrounding environment brown et al 2008 kim et al 2021 zhang et al 2022c b however despite considerable progress in recent years many challenges remain in vegetation stress monitoring due to the complexity of drought process firstly the existing indices failed to clearly model the drought development from physical conditions to vegetation destruction for instance vhi sdci sdi and midi integrated vegetation index and external physical conditions into a combined index without considering their differences in data distribution secondly although some applications have assessed vegetation response to drought cui et al 2022 xu et al 2021 yang et al 2021 quantitative analysis of the sensitivities of different vegetation is still lacking moreover vegetation can counter regulate the drought process which is not concerned in the present drought index construction hoek van dijke et al 2022 sungmin et al 2022 tng et al 2022 yuan et al 2022 zhang and zhang 2019 thirdly although the combined indices are booming most of them are designed independently of each other focusing only on integrating several single indices and neglecting the potential of existing integrated indices shen et al 2019 wei et al 2021 zhang et al 2019 in view of these issues this study proposes a novel integrated drought index named type response aided drought index tradi based on the drought response factors decomposed from diverse vegetation types and the comprehensive integration of single and combined drought indices firstly the vegetation drought stress is modeled as two sub processes 1 from physical dry conditions indicated by tci smci and pci to drought stress and 2 from drought stress to vegetation destruction indicated by vci then to reveal the vegetation response mechanisms to drought conditions the contribution of different types of vegetation in each sub process is considered and response factors of each vegetation type are decomposed from a remote sensing perspective secondly based on the decomposed response factors four single indices tci smci pci vci and three combined indices vhi sdci midi are adjusted to improve their performances in drought stress assessment finally the adjusted drought indices above tci smci pci vci vhi sdci and midi are all integrated into the tradi through the principal component analysis pca method the main objective of this study is to 1 refine drought process modeling and divide the drought process into sub processes from physical dry conditions to drought stress and from drought stress to vegetation damage 2 decompose vegetation drought response factors and explore their utility in drought monitoring 3 combine multiple drought indices to integrate their ability in capturing multi dimensional drought characteristics this study is an extended and improved version of our previous research yin et al 2021 published on the 2021 ieee international geoscience and remote sensing symposium igarss 2021 compared with the previous version this manuscript clarified the modeling of drought process and modified the tradi establishment and simultaneously supplemented more adequate experiments in typical drought events to examine the performance of tradi 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the continental united states conus divided into 344 climate divisions was selected as our study area the conus covers the area within 24 50 n and 66 126 w and is dominated by different climates such as the continental climate in the north central plains the subtropical climate in the southern regions the temperature climate in the northeast and the semiarid climate in the west as shown in fig 1 the forests including evergreen and deciduous forests are mainly distributed in western southeastern and northeastern regions the shrublands and grasslands are located in the western regions the croplands marked with reddish brown are mainly in the central plains 2 2 data to calculate the different drought indices multi source data products were selected including modis version 6 mod09ga and mod11a1 trmm 3b43 and gldas version 2 1 among them the mod09ga was used to build the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi while the day time lst was selected from mod11a1 besides soil moisture and precipitation data were obtained from the gldas 2 1 and trmm 3b43 respectively all the data above have the period of 2001 to 2019 and only the growing season april to october is considered for each year this is due to two considerations firstly in the months outside the growing season some areas of the conus are covered with snow and ice which will bring uncertainty to the index establishment secondly this study focuses on the response of vegetation to drought during growth the ndvi was calculated based on the red and near infrared bands of mod09ga with daily temporal resolution and 500 m spatial resolution zhang et al 2022a considering the noise caused by cloud coverage monthly composition was performed after removing the cloudy pixels finally the monthly ndvi was resampled from 500 m to 1 km resolution like the ndvi day time lst obtained from mod11a1 was preprocessed through a similar process including cloudy pixel removal and monthly composition since the spatial resolution of mod11a1 is 1 km already this product was not resampled the gldas 2 1 is a climate simulation product merging station based and satellite based observations through data assimilation algorithms it contains more than 35 sub products such as albedo evapotranspiration wind speed soil moisture etc its soil moisture products have been frequently used in drought monitoring hoffmann et al 2020 liu et al 2020 zhang et al 2017b in this study soil moisture at the depth of 0 10 cm was selected the spatial resolution of selected soil moisture was unified to 1 km and the temporal resolution was aggregated to 1 month to monitor precipitation deficits precipitation data were obtained from trmm 3b43 which is an integrated product derived from multiple microwave satellites the 3b43 dataset provided precipitation rate mm hr rather than monthly accumulated precipitation mm therefore before the spatial resolution was resampled to 1 km the data conversion was conducted by multiplying the precipitation rate by the total hours of the corresponding month in addition yearly land cover maps from 2001 to 2019 were provided by the modis mcd12q1 v6 product based on international geosphere biosphere programme igbp classification the igbp has 17 types of land cover in the conus to simplify the analysis the igbp was reclassified into six broad categories in this study i e forest shrublands grasslands croplands water and built up and barren pdsi is one of the most classical and widely used indices for drought monitoring in the united states and it has a solid physical mechanism based on water balance theory aiken and rauscher 2020 biondi and meko 2019 tian et al 2018 thus this study selected the monthly in situ pdsi during the growing season from 2001 to 2019 as our reference data the divisional pdsi of the 344 climate divisions was accessed from the nclimdiv dataset of the national centers for environmental information ncei https www ncei noaa gov the pdsi was chosen for two purposes firstly the pdsi of the driest year was used to decompose the response factors of different vegetation secondly it was used to quantitatively evaluate the performance of the proposed tradi in other dry years in addition to pdsi monthly in situ precipitation from ncei was also obtained the divisional precipitation was used to build spis with continuous scales 1 month to 24 months and further assess the lagged time of the tradi the calculation of spi is based on the algorithm proposed by mckee et al 1993 for qualitative evaluation the maps of the united states drought monitor usdm https droughtmonitor unl edu were collected the usdm releases weekly drought maps with five drought degrees d0 abnormally dry d1 moderatedrought d2 severedrought d3 extremedrought and d4 exceptionaldrought in this study the map closest to the 15th of the calendar month was selected as the representative of the overall drought condition of that month all data used in this study are detailed in table 1 3 methods fig 2 shows the framework of this study firstly multi source products were preprocessed to obtain monthly basic datasets with 1 km resolution i e ndvi lst soil moisture and precipitation and then the 19 year four basic datasets were calculated separately into four single drought indices in section 3 1 according to the percentage of drought affected areas monitored by usdm from 2001 to 2019 as shown in fig s1 several extremely severe drought events occurred in the conus such as droughts in 2002 2004 2006 2007 2011 2015 and 2018 in particular the drought event in 2012 was the most serious both in terms of the affected area and the severity thus the pdsi and land cover map in 2012 were used to decompose response factors of different vegetation types from different single indices detailed steps about this part are then presented in section 3 2 then in section 3 3 based on the response factors obtained four single indices and three linearly integrated indices were reconstructed and the seven indices were further integrated to establish the tradi by principal component analysis pca algorithm information about tradi construction is described in detail in the following sections 3 1 drought index calculation this part presents the construction of multiple drought indices detailed information on single indices including tci smci pci and vci and combined indices including vhi sdci midi and idmi is provided in table 2 these single indices can reveal drought conditions from the perspectives of vegetation evapotranspiration soil and precipitation but if they are applied alone the drought cannot be fully depicted tian et al 2020 vhi sdci and midi are typical examples of combined indices that integrate multiple single indices to provide comprehensive drought monitoring guo et al 2019 zhang et al 2022b these three combined indices greatly contributed to the development of drought indices albeit in a linear combination based approach in this study the four single indices as well as three linearly combined indices were selected to be incorporated into the tradi while the idmi was used to evaluate the performance of tradi 3 2 response factors decomposition in this study the drought process was divided into two sub processes 1 from physical dry conditions to drought stress and 2 from drought stress to drought impacts fig s2 accordingly the four single indices were classified into two categories tci smci pci and vci the first category was used to indicate the intensity of physical dry conditions from different perspectives while the second was to measure the drought s impacts on vegetation drought stress here is a hypothetical virtual parameter which is the result of physical dry conditions and the direct cause of vegetation destruction we introduced drought stress to make the whole drought process clearer and more specific vegetation always exchanges energy e g heat and material e g water with the environment and affects the surrounding microclimate during its growth yin et al 2022 besides in the long term natural process without human intervention precipitation and other climatic factors dominate the land cover types strack et al 2008 wang et al 2021a for example areas with deficient precipitation have sparse vegetation while areas with abundant precipitation are mainly covered with forests grass and crops since there is a close interaction between vegetation and its surrounding environment it is necessary to explore the drought response mechanism of vegetation in different environmental variables throughout the drought process thus in this study each single index was decomposed separately to retrieve response factors of different vegetation types 3 2 1 response factors in the 1st subprocess to avoid repetition we took tci as the representative of tci smci pci to introduce the response factor calculation in the first subprocess theoretically the tci ranges from 0 to 1 with lower tci values indicating more severe temperature anomalies furthermore in vegetation areas the temperature is regulated by vegetation hence we defined the temperature anomaly induced drought stress as ds the degree of temperature anomaly as 1 t c i and the vegetation factor as ω then we adopted a linear model to bridge these parameters and proposed a drought stress equation 1 ds 1 t c i ω ε where ε refers to a noise term and can be ignored in practical applications the physical mechanism of this equation is that the drought stress ds resulting from temperature anomalies is dominated by both the thermal conditions 1 t c i and vegetation effects ω there are two advantages to selecting a linear model firstly the linear model is simpler than nonlinear models which is beneficial to the transferable applications in other drought prone regions secondly the linear model is beneficial to the subsequent procedures including the construction and decomposition of the overdetermined equations for each climate division we assume that there are n f pixels of forests n s pixels of shrublands n g pixels of grasslands and n c pixels of croplands then the mean drought stress for each division can be defined as 2 d s mean ω f i 1 n f 1 t c i f ω s i 1 n s 1 t c i s ω g i 1 n g 1 t c i g ω c i 1 n c 1 t c i c n f n s n g n c where ω f ω s ω g and ω c represent the response factors of forests shrublands grasslands and croplands respectively the tc i f tc i s tc i g and tc i c represent the tci pixel values of forests shrublands grasslands and croplands respectively since the pdsi has a solid physical mechanism and is based on the supply and demand concept of water balance we adopted this index to replace the drought stress ds the pdsi data is provided in units of climate divisions by the ncei thus the mean drought stress and the divisional pdsi can be bridged 3 d s mean 1 n o r m pdsi where n o r m pdsi is the normalization of pdsi data generally more severe droughts tend to cause vegetation to have a larger response amplitude which is more conducive to the decomposition of response factors in this study we selected the pdsi in 2012 as the drought stress data because the drought event in 2012 is the most severe from 2001 to 2019 fig s1 considering that there are 344 climate divisions in the conus and seven months april to october were concerned in each year we constructed a total of 344 7 2408 equations in 2012 4 i 1 n f 1 t c i f 1 i 1 n s 1 t c i s 1 i 1 n g 1 t c i g 1 i 1 n c 1 t c i c 1 i 1 n f 1 t c i f j i 1 n s 1 t c i s j i 1 n g 1 t c i g j i 1 n c 1 t c i c j i 1 n f 1 t c i f 2408 i 1 n s 1 t c i s 2408 i 1 n g 1 t c i g 2408 i 1 n c 1 t c i c 2408 ω f ω s ω g ω c n 1 1 n o r m pdsi 1 n j 1 n o r m pdsi j n 2408 1 n o r m pdsi 2408 where j represents the jth equation of the 2408 equations and n j represents the total number of vegetation pixels in corresponding climate divisions finally the response factors were decomposed from eq 4 based on the least square method lsm response factors from smci and pci can also be obtained in a similar way to that of tci 3 2 2 response factors in the 2nd subprocess drought stress hinders the growth of vegetation and causes vegetation destruction in this study as shown in fig s2 vegetation destruction mainly refers to the impact of drought stress on vegetation health and the impact can be reflected in the changes of spectral characteristics such as the decrease in vci values moreover due to the difference in drought vulnerability vegetation has diverse performance under drought stress thus in the second subprocess we proposed a vegetation drought response equation 5 1 v c i d s ω ε where 1 v c i refers to the drought stress induced decrease in vci here it should be noted that we assumed that water condition deficits were the only reason for vci decline the physical mechanism of this equation is that when subjected to drought stress ds vegetational response ds ω is displayed as a decrease in vegetation index 1 v c i based on the pdsi data from april to october 2012 2408 equations in eq 6 were established then the response factors of different vegetation were calculated through least square method 6 i 1 n f 1 v c i f 1 i 1 n s 1 v c i s 1 i 1 n g 1 v c i g 1 i 1 n c 1 v c i c 1 i 1 n f 1 v c i f j i 1 n s 1 v c i s j i 1 n g 1 v c i g j i 1 n c 1 v c i c j i 1 n f 1 v c i f 2408 i 1 n s 1 v c i s 2408 i 1 n g 1 v c i g 2408 i 1 n c 1 v c i c 2408 1 ω f 1 ω s 1 ω g 1 ω c n 1 1 n o r m pdsi 1 n j 1 n o r m pdsi j n 2408 1 n o r m pdsi 2408 3 3 tradi establishment based on the vegetation factors in section 3 2 the drought stress in other dry years was further derived in each pixel by back substituting the response factors into the drought stress equation and the vegetation drought response equation using the corresponding land cover maps in general a smaller index value usually indicated a more severe drought therefore we added a negative sign to these two equations to make the constructed drought stress consistent with the existing drought indices the predicted drought stress based on tci can be defined as 7 d s tci 1 t c i ω where the d s tci above can be regarded as a fine tuned form of tci through the same process drought stress of other single indices can also be obtained i e d s smci and d s pci similarly predicted drought stress based on vci is presented in eq 8 furthermore traditional combined indices were reconstructed by blending fine tuned single indices such as the d s vhi d s sdci d s midi 8 d s vci 1 v c i 1 ω the final step of constructing the tradi is to integrate drought stress from multiple dimensions this study chose the principal component analysis pca to fuse the reconstructed indices above pca is an unsupervised method which can integrate the information of multiple indices without prior knowledge and it has been widely used in the synthesis of comprehensive indices arun kumar et al 2021 chang et al 2022 jiao et al 2019 different from the traditional combined indices that only focus on the fusion of single indices tradi also considers the potential of existing combined indices the tradi aims to assimilate multi dimensional drought characteristics from single indices and extract additional prior information from existing combined indices in this study seven reconstructed indices were all integrated through eq 9 and the first principal component pc1 was selected as the proposed tradi 9 tradi p c a d s vci d s tci d s smci d s pci d s vhi d s sdci d s midi the response factors of different vegetation types were validated on both single indices and combined indices by performing the pearson correlation analysis between different drought indices and pdsi data in other dry years except 2012 additionally the combined index idmi was constructed and the usdm was obtained to quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate the performance of tradi 4 results and discussions 4 1 decomposing response factors for different vegetation through least square method response factors of different vegetation types were decomposed and the decomposition was respectively performed on four widely used single indices including tci smci pci and vci detailed results are illustrated in fig 3 the response factors from the four indices were all below 1 with a range of 0 82 to 0 98 for tci 0 71 to 0 95 for smci 0 72 to 0 87 for pci and 0 89 to 0 99 for vci respectively although all response factors are less than 1 0 they have different meanings for different indices for tci smci and pci a response value less than 1 0 indicated that in vegetative areas drought stress caused by anomalous temperature insufficient soil water and deficient precipitation could be slightly alleviated in other words the drought intensity exhibited by these physical conditions was worse than the drought stress suffered by vegetation while for vci the response results suggested that drought stress is not equivalent to drought impact and the drought impact reflected in vegetation indices is often weaker than the intensity of drought stress according to the drought stress equation and the vegetation drought response equation a response factor close to 1 0 means that the physical dry conditions or the drought effects are consistent with the drought stress suffered by vegetation such as the factors of shrublands and grasslands in tci fig 3 a and croplands in vci fig 3 d in all the subplots a d of fig 3 the forest response factor is the smallest among all vegetation types implying that the forest system is tolerant in the process of drought duration not only in the stage from physical dry conditions to drought stress but also in the stage from drought stress to vegetation destruction this phenomenon is probably due to the developed roots of trees in forest areas and their insensitivity to drought croplands showed low response weights in tci smci and pci but a high weight in vci suggesting that physical dry conditions in agricultural areas had a relatively low rate of conversion to drought stress while drought stress had a higher rate of conversion to drought effects the characteristics of crops and agricultural management might explain this difference crops were vulnerable and sensitive to drought stress but irrigation and other water management measures alleviated the conversion from dry conditions to drought stress the retrieved vegetation factors are of great significance not only for the comparison of vegetation vulnerability but also for the analysis of drought evolution 4 2 validation of response factors 4 2 1 validation on single indices sis to evaluate the effectiveness of response factors we quantitatively compared the predicted drought stress and corresponding single indices in pearson correlation coefficients with in situ pdsi data based on the time series of drought exposure from usdm this section focused on the dry years in 2002 2004 2006 2007 2011 2013 2015 and 2018 the results of the correlation coefficients are shown in table 3 in all the listed dry years the predicted drought stress achieved better performance than the original single indices except for the comparison of vci pairs in 2003 and 2006 although the correlation coefficients between smci and pdsi were usually the highest the improvement after incorporating vegetation responses was the most significant in tci fig 4 the correlation coefficient improvement ranged from 0 012 to 0 053 in tci pairs from 0 010 to 0 042 in smci pairs from 0 005 to 0 036 in pci pairs and from 0 006 to 0 027 in vci pairs among the four index pairs the improvement in vci was the slightest this may be because the process from drought stress to drought impact is more complex than that from physical dry conditions to drought stress in addition the improvement in pci is also relatively slight many factors might account for this on the one hand pci is a meteorological index for monitoring precipitation deficits but insufficient precipitation is not the only reason for drought stress temperature anomalies soil water shortages and even atmospheric vapor pressure deficits are the potential inducements of drought stress kimm et al 2020 on the other hand part of precipitation forms surface runoff rather than infiltration into the soil which can lead to the pci underestimating drought intensity overall all the single indices showed increased correlation coefficients with pdsi after being adjusted by vegetation factors indicating that considering vegetation response in the drought process is promising for both drought index modification and drought monitoring 4 2 2 validation on combined indices cis the role of vegetation response on single indices has been evaluated and its performance on combined indices is further discussed in this section we selected four widely used combined indices including three linearly weighted indices i e vhi sdci midi and one pca based index i e idmi fig 5 shows the correlations between different indices and in situ pdsi from 2001 to 2019 in fig 5 sdci and midi were obtained by the linear combination of three single indices and they got better performances than the vhi which was built only by vci and tci additionally the pca based idmi established by the fusion of four indices was the best among the other three combined indices due to the complexity of drought the ability of a single index to characterize drought is limited zhang et al 2017b however multidimensional data can complement each other from different perspectives and provide a comprehensive description of droughts chang et al 2022 liu et al 2020 sánchez et al 2018 besides since a combined index is designed by optimizing the combination of different single indices and assigning their weights it can provide additional prior information for drought monitoring jiao et al 2019 compared with the corresponding original index the derived drought stress was more correlated with pdsi in most cases this result suggested that response factors contributed not only to single indices but also to combined indices besides the universal improvements revealed that vegetation response factors could be applied to other drought monitoring applications in fig 5 all four indices showed a significant improvement in most drought events except in 2005 2010 2016 and 2019 for example in 2005 sdci and d s sdci were equal in correlation coefficient with in situ pdsi in 2005 2010 2016 and 2019 the d s idmi showed decreased coefficients compared with the original idmi according to the usdm fig s1 these years were relatively humid thus this phenomenon was probably because single indices slightly fluctuated under a normal threshold in humid conditions and the 1 v c i or 1 t c i overestimated drought stress drought indices are generally proposed to indicate drought intensity in a drought event not in humid cases therefore from this point of view the benefits of vegetation response factors may outweigh the accompanying disadvantages 4 3 evaluation of tradi performance to provide comprehensive monitoring of drought and eliminate weak performance under humid conditions the tradi was established by integrating four single indices and three combined indices in this section the drought category definition of tradi was first introduced and then we performed a comprehensive assessment of tradi specifically vhi sdci midi and idmi were adopted to quantitatively compare the tradi performance and multi scale spis were calculated to evaluate its time lag effect additionally tradi was qualitatively assessed in typical dry years with the usdm maps 4 3 1 drought classification in tradi in usdm drought was classified into 6 levels based on its historical frequency distributions including none no drought d0 abnormally dry d1 moderate drought d2 severe drought d3 extreme drought and d4 exceptional drought li et al 2022 xu et al 2022 the classification thresholds for usdm were 2 5 10 20 and 30 xu et al 2020 to be consistent with usdm we also classified tradi into 6 types the historical and cumulative frequency of tradi from 2001 to 2019 is illustrated in fig 6 and the drought classification is shown in table 4 the percentile for tradi is 1 97 for d4 4 86 for d3 11 53 for d2 21 60 for d1 and 31 21 for d0 respectively the corresponding index threshold is 0 95 0 80 0 60 0 40 and 0 25 respectively 4 3 2 feasibility of obtaining tradi from pca as the tradi is the first principal component after pca method whether it covers the main information of the original data needs to be tested and the degree of eigenvalue separation also needs to be evaluated fig 7 shows the percentage of total variance explained by each principal component in each month april to october from 2001 to 2019 the percentage of total variance ranges from 40 to 75 in pc1 15 to 35 in pc2 5 to 20 in pc3 2 to 10 in pc4 and nearly zero in pc5 7 in most months during the study period the first principal component covers the main information with an average percentage of 60 in addition the north method north et al 1982 was adopted to test the separation of eigenvalues the north test tells us that if λ 1 δ λ 1 λ 2 in fig 8 we can say that the first principal component is significantly separated from the second as shown in fig 8 except for a few months when separation was not significant the two principal components passed the north test in most months during the study period 4 3 3 comparison with combined indices since the tradi was obtained from the integration of seven fine tuned drought indices eq 9 this section evaluated it from two perspectives firstly the tradi was compared with the modified idmi i e a combination of four fine tuned single indices to examine the contributions of three linearly combined indices secondly we evaluated the tradi s performance with the original combined drought indices in each year from 2001 to 2019 the results are illustrated in fig 9 the ds idmi in fig 5 showed significant improvement above the original idmi but its performance in wet years was unsatisfactory compared with ds idmi the proposed tradi presented a closer relation to drought in these years fig 9 a specifically its coefficients are 0 525 0 096 in 2005 0 621 0 094 in 2010 0 594 0 092 in 2016 and 0 518 0 028 in 2019 these results suggested that existing combined indices were helpful for establishing a more complex integrated index as they could supplement necessary prior drought information in index integration rhee et al 2010 in comparison with common combined indices tradi exhibited the best performance in almost all years during the study period fig 9 b the order of combined index performance from good to bad was tradi idmi sdci or midi vhi the vhi consisted of only two single indices so the correlation coefficients were relatively low while sdci and midi generally outperformed vhi probably because they blended drought information from three dimensions table 2 in addition the superiority of idmi and tradi might lie in the integration of drought information from four perspectives arun kumar et al 2021 despite the remarkable performance of idmi we did not incorporate it into tradi construction but selected three linearly weighted indices vhi sdci and midi which could reduce the algorithm complexity of tradi hao and singh 2015 4 3 4 comparison with usdm the monthly spatial distribution of tradi was qualitatively compared with usdm in two extremely dry years 2011 and 2012 and one less dry year 2019 among them the drought in 2011 was extremely serious with the highest percentage of drought affected areas at the d4 level while the 2012 drought had the largest percentage of total affected areas throughout the entire study period rippey 2015 wang et al 2015 compared with 2011 and 2012 the drought in 2019 was relatively mild and could be selected to evaluate tradi from a different perspective schubert et al 2021 the results are illustrated in fig 10 for the 2011 drought usdm indicated that drought affected areas were mainly concentrated in the southern areas of conus such as texas oklahoma new mexico and so on and showed a trend of gradual expansion in space the drought began to intensify in may 2011 and covered florida georgia and other areas near the gulf of mexico then in august the drought condition near the gulf of mexico began to slow down the tradi well captured the spatial patterns of the 2011 drought and showed similar results to usdm especially in texas oklahoma and new mexico while in florida georgia and alabama the performance of tradi is unstable tradi could accurately indicate the drought conditions of these areas from april to june but tended to underestimate their drought severity from july to october the reason is that these areas have a humid climate and the performance of tradi is limited in humid conditions according to usdm the drought in 2012 mainly originated in the southwest of the conus from april to october drought conditions gradually deteriorated and the drought center shifted from the southwest to the center of the great plains the spatial propagation of the 2012 drought was well tracked by tradi before july the drought center was located in the southwest and from july drought in the southwestern states such as new mexico and western texas was alleviated while the central conus began to suffer extreme drought conditions moreover as the drought center moved drought severity depicted an increasing trend as well as drought coverage compare with 2011 and 2012 the drought in 2019 was mild with only a few areas suffering drought conditions although the drought intensified in august the worst hit areas in texas were with a drought level weaker than d3 in the development of the 2019 drought from august to october tradi well revealed the drought in texas the southwest and southeast of conus schubert et al 2021 compared with usdm the tradi was more sensitive and showed a wider coverage encompassing the areas indicated by usdm so it might be suitable for the drought early warning system although tradi can illustrate the spatiotemporal drought patterns and capture the shift of drought gravity center its performance in some areas is different from that of usdm such as the misestimate in several months in 2012 and 2019 this is probably due to the following two reasons firstly the tradi in this study involves four datasets and seven derived drought indices while usdm integrates local expert experience and incorporates more than 70 indicators svoboda et al 2002 including precipitation temperature soil moisture streamflow vapor pressure deficit streamflow etc the multidimensional data can provide drought information from multiple perspectives and enable usdm to monitor drought conditions comprehensively kuwayama et al 2019 leeper et al 2022 secondly whether hydrological drought is considered is the other difference between usdm and tradi the tradi is built by integrating several drought indices which have been modified by vegetation response factors and the response factors of different vegetation types are obtained from the overdetermined equations for the four single drought indices i e vci tci smci and pci and pdsi among these four basic indices tci smci and pci represent physical drought conditions while the vci represents the drought impact on vegetation growth the four indices cover meteorological and agricultural drought rather than hydrological drought as for the usdm hydrological indicators including streamflow and water level of the reservoir and lake are all incorporated into the usdm system future studies need to focus on incorporating more multi source datasets and considering multiple drought types to construct multi faceted products comparable to usdm 4 3 5 time lag effects evaluation to assess the time lag effects of tradi on meteorological drought correlation coefficients between tradi and multi scale spis were calculated the major benefit of spi is its ability to be derived on any given time scale facilitating the monitoring of short and long term anomalies in water resources huang et al 2015 therefore an approximate time scale of the spi can be viewed as the lag time of the drought index in response to meteorological drought huang et al 2015 in this study the spi with multiple scales one month to 24 months was calculated based on the algorithm proposed by mckee et al 1993 as shown in fig 11 tradi is highly correlated with short term spis especially spi 1 r 0 661 and spi 2 r 0 665 and shows a trend of decreasing correlation as the spi scale increases in different climate divisions as shown in fig 12 the lagged timesale between tradi and spi is mainly from one month to three months moreover according to the land cover map in fig 1 tradi and spi 1 achieved the highest coefficient in the southwest northeast and southeast of the conus mainly covered by forests crops and shrubs while in the central conus where the terrain type is mainly grassland tradi got the highest coefficients with spi 2 spi is a standard index of meteorological drought rashid and beecham 2019 wang et al 2020 while the tradi in this study is proposed to monitor the drought stress induced by physical dry conditions there is a lag in the progression from meteorological drought to drought stress and the lagged time is nearly 2 months more specifically between one month and three months however due to data limitations this study only conducted a monthly analysis more accurate lagged time may need to be determined in future work on a sub monthly or weekly scale 4 4 uncertainties the decomposition of vegetation response factors was based on the data from 2012 as the drought in 2012 was the most severe which is favorable for response decomposition however it should be noted that the complexity of the 2012 drought might bring uncertainties to the whole construction process of tradi fig 13 shows the monthly fluctuations of four basic parameters lst soil moisture precipitation and ndvi in 2012 and the mean fluctuations of these parameters over the period from 2001 to 2019 theoretically when drought occurs these parameters deviate from their normal state for example the values of precipitation soil moisture and vegetation index decrease while the values of temperature increase nevertheless as shown in fig 13 d ndvi presented a negative deviation from june to october while a positive deviation in april and may this may be due to the advancement of vegetation phenophase during the early stage of the 2012 drought event in the early drought stage clear and cloudless weather improved vegetation s reception of solar radiation and as a result increased vegetation index the phenomenon is consistent with existing studies for instance yue et al 2015 probed the past 30 year phenology trend of us deciduous forests and found that the vegetation phenology in 2012 was significantly ahead of other years moreover qiu et al 2022 observed an earlier peak of vegetation activity in 2012 using solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence sif data vci is built by normalizing the ndvi values of each month and the earlier phenology period can cause the vci to underestimate drought severity in april and may in this study drought induced vegetation loss was defined as 1 v c i thereby the earlier phenology period further contributed to the overestimation of vegetation response factors however we used the data for multiple months from april to october which could alleviate this uncertainty to some extent additionally another uncertainty lies in the type of vegetation in this study the 17 types of land cover in igbp products were reclassified into 6 major categories including 4 vegetation categories forests shrublands grasslands and croplands however the diversity of subcategories within each vegetation category may also play an important role for example the seasonal fluctuation of ndvi in the evergreen forest is essentially different from that in the deciduous forest although the tradi framework preliminarily explored the diverse responses of major vegetation types a finer investigation would be beneficial for a deeper and clearer understanding of the drought process future research should pay more attention to the vegetation response in fine grained land cover classification apart from the above uncertainties other factors might also influence the results for example the datasets used in this study cover 2001 2019 and the time series is a little short which may lead to uncertainty in the calculation of condition indices in addition data source data resolution and the selection of single condition indices may also bring errors to the vegetation response factor decomposition and tradi establishment 5 conclusion understanding the role of vegetation in drought process is significant for drought monitoring and drought mitigation in this study we introduced drought stress to bridge physical dry conditions and drought induced vegetation damage and modeled the drought process as two sub processes response factors for four types of vegetation trees grasses shrubs and crops were decomposed from the basic drought indices tci smci pci and vci and were used to adjust the commonly used drought indices based on the adjusted indices and the principal component analysis pca a new integrated index tradi was proposed the main conclusions are as follows 1 in the two sub processes the response factors of the four types of vegetation are all less than 1 0 indicating that vegetation can alleviate the impact of drought during the propagation process from physical dry conditions to vegetation destruction forests in particular achieved the lowest response value suggesting that trees were the most drought tolerant compared with other land cover types 2 after being adjusted by response factors both single indices and combined indices show a closer correlation with pdsi revealing that it is necessary to consider the contribution of different vegetation in drought index establishment moreover the improvement due to response factors is more significant in dry years 3 compared with several commonly used combined indices vhi sdci midi and idmi the tradi exhibited the best performance in almost all years from 2001 to 2019 indicating the reliability and robustness of tradi 4 in qualitative comparison with the comprehensive product usdm tradi showed consistency with usdm in 2011 but inconsistency in some months of 2012 and 2019 which is probably due to the lack of information on hydrological dimension thus hydrological indicators such as streamflow water levels in rivers and lakes and runoff should be incorporated in future studies to improve the ability of tradi in comprehensive drought monitoring credit authorship contribution statement guoying yin conceptualization

2248,drought is a complex process that usually stems from aberrant climatic conditions such as precipitation deficits and temperature anomalies drought can pose a serious threat to vegetation growth which in turn regulates the process of drought evolution an in depth understanding of the interaction between drought and vegetation is crucial not only for drought monitoring but also for drought mitigation to this end this study divided the drought process into two sub processes 1 from physical dry conditions to drought stress and 2 from drought stress to vegetation destruction and introduced vegetation response factors to quantitatively depict the vegetation contributions in each sub process response factors of different vegetation types were decomposed respectively from temperature condition index tci soil moisture condition index smci and precipitation condition index pci in the first sub process and from vegetation condition index vci in the second sub process further this study proposed a novel integrated drought index named type response aided drought index tradi based on the response factors of different vegetation types vegetation response factors were applied to fine tune several commonly used single drought indices to verify their effectiveness and the proposed tradi was evaluated by comparing it with several combined indices including vegetation health index vhi scaled drought condition index sdci microwave integrated drought index midi and integrated drought monitoring index idmi moreover the tradi was qualitatively evaluated with the maps from u s drought monitor usdm in the 2011 and 2012 drought events across the continental united states conus our results showed that adjusted by vegetation response factors single drought indices as well as combined drought indices showed a closer correlation with the palmer drought severity index pdsi than their original forms indicating the strength of response factors in modifying existing indices furthermore the proposed tradi performed better than vhi sdci midi and idmi and was consistent with usdm in typical drought events this study provides a new perspective on understanding the process of drought affecting vegetation and highlights the importance of considering vegetation response in drought index establishment keywords drought monitoring drought stress vegetation response conus data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction drought is an unfavorable climate driven phenomenon that arises from prolonged precipitation deficits and temperature anomalies and has devastating effects on agriculture wu et al 2022 zhou et al 2020 ecology pozner et al 2022 economy espinosa tasón et al 2022 and human life kuil et al 2019 generally drought can be categorized into four major types i e meteorological agricultural hydrological and socio economic gu et al 2020 drought with insufficient precipitation for several weeks is classified as meteorological drought mirabbasi et al 2013 sharma et al 2022 while agricultural drought often occurs when meteorological drought is sustained and the soil moisture requirements of vegetation growth cannot be met son et al 2021 the occurrence of hydrological drought is judged by the drop in water levels of lakes reservoirs and rivers ding et al 2021 lai et al 2019 socio economic drought emphasizes the comprehensive impacts of the above drought types on industry and human living dikshit et al 2021 lee et al 2022 although drought is divided into four types the classification boundary of these four drought types is blurred this is because the drought event is a disaster process with slow onset prolonged duration and complex interaction with multiple factors such as the atmosphere vegetation soil and human beings pei et al 2018 especially the interaction between the physical stress of drought and the physiological response of vegetation is particularly complicated and has always been a hot issue in drought monitoring deng et al 2021 wang et al 2021b yin et al 2021 zhang and zhang 2019 up to now considerable efforts have been devoted to assessing the effects of drought stress on vegetation traditionally drought stress was obtained through tree ring chronologies and laboratory based measurements for example cook and jacoby 1977 explored the potential of tree ring records in revealing historical changes in temperature and precipitation bosabalidis and kofidis 2002 compared the leaf anatomical features of two olive cultivars and studied their different characteristics of drought response clauw et al 2015 analyzed growth related phenotypes of six arabidopsis and evaluated their adaption under mild drought conditions mcgregor et al 2021 investigated the drought vulnerability of trees with different heights and leaf drought tolerance these studies can finely characterize drought induced vegetation destruction at the plant leaf and even cellular level but cannot achieve continuous monitoring of drought dynamics given that the drought stress on vegetation is caused by insufficient precipitation and abnormal evapotranspiration some studies proposed station based indices to monitor the surrounding physical conditions of vegetation such as precipitation temperature and soil moisture content in different soil layers rather than directly monitoring the plants themselves for instance palmer 1965 proposed the palmer drought severity index pdsi based upon a physical water balance model by using precipitation and surface temperature data the pdsi is one of the most classic indices in drought monitoring and has been used for more than 50 years based on the asymmetric frequency distribution of precipitation mckee et al 1993 developed the standardized precipitation index spi the spi was recommended as a standard meteorological index by the world meteorological organization wmo and has been widely accepted in measuring the intensity of precipitation deficit hayes et al 2011 furthermore the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei modified the spi by incorporating the information on potential evapotranspiration vicente serrano et al 2010 although the site based gauge is accurate and can be considered as ground truth the sparse spatial distribution and high maintenance cost of meteorological stations make it unsuitable for high resolution and large scale applications yoon et al 2020 zhang et al 2017a due to the development of satellite based earth observation the drought impact on vegetation can be gauged indirectly through the retrieval of surrounding environmental factors or directly through the vegetation index yin et al 2021 zhong et al 2021 in the early stage of drought monitoring researchers constructed many single indices to focus on a specific aspect of drought the temperature condition index tci and vegetation condition index vci were developed by kogan 1995 based on the satellite imagery from the advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr to respectively monitor thermal anomalies and drought induced vegetation changes in the continental united states conus rhee et al 2010 introduced the precipitation condition index pci by using data from the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm satellite zhang and jia 2013 derived the soil moisture condition index smci from the advanced microwave scanning radiometer eos amsr e and applied it to meteorological drought monitoring in northern china nevertheless drought has multi faceted effects and its multidimensional characteristics cannot be fully reflected through a single index aghakouchak et al 2015 to solve this many combined indices were developed kogan 1995 integrated vci and tci into the vegetation health index vhi through linear weight allocation rhee et al 2010 derived the scaled drought condition index sdci by linearly combining the vci tci and pci zhang and jia 2013 blended tci pci and smci into the microwave integrated drought index midi in addition to linear combination some other studies are more objective by using the principal component analysis pca to integrate indices relevant examples can be easily found in recent publications such as the synthesized drought index sdi du et al 2013 the station enabled geographically independent integrated drought index giidi station jiao et al 2019 and the integrated drought monitoring index idmi arun kumar et al 2021 compared with single indices combined indices have more advantages in comprehensively characterizing vegetation dynamics and vegetation surrounding environment brown et al 2008 kim et al 2021 zhang et al 2022c b however despite considerable progress in recent years many challenges remain in vegetation stress monitoring due to the complexity of drought process firstly the existing indices failed to clearly model the drought development from physical conditions to vegetation destruction for instance vhi sdci sdi and midi integrated vegetation index and external physical conditions into a combined index without considering their differences in data distribution secondly although some applications have assessed vegetation response to drought cui et al 2022 xu et al 2021 yang et al 2021 quantitative analysis of the sensitivities of different vegetation is still lacking moreover vegetation can counter regulate the drought process which is not concerned in the present drought index construction hoek van dijke et al 2022 sungmin et al 2022 tng et al 2022 yuan et al 2022 zhang and zhang 2019 thirdly although the combined indices are booming most of them are designed independently of each other focusing only on integrating several single indices and neglecting the potential of existing integrated indices shen et al 2019 wei et al 2021 zhang et al 2019 in view of these issues this study proposes a novel integrated drought index named type response aided drought index tradi based on the drought response factors decomposed from diverse vegetation types and the comprehensive integration of single and combined drought indices firstly the vegetation drought stress is modeled as two sub processes 1 from physical dry conditions indicated by tci smci and pci to drought stress and 2 from drought stress to vegetation destruction indicated by vci then to reveal the vegetation response mechanisms to drought conditions the contribution of different types of vegetation in each sub process is considered and response factors of each vegetation type are decomposed from a remote sensing perspective secondly based on the decomposed response factors four single indices tci smci pci vci and three combined indices vhi sdci midi are adjusted to improve their performances in drought stress assessment finally the adjusted drought indices above tci smci pci vci vhi sdci and midi are all integrated into the tradi through the principal component analysis pca method the main objective of this study is to 1 refine drought process modeling and divide the drought process into sub processes from physical dry conditions to drought stress and from drought stress to vegetation damage 2 decompose vegetation drought response factors and explore their utility in drought monitoring 3 combine multiple drought indices to integrate their ability in capturing multi dimensional drought characteristics this study is an extended and improved version of our previous research yin et al 2021 published on the 2021 ieee international geoscience and remote sensing symposium igarss 2021 compared with the previous version this manuscript clarified the modeling of drought process and modified the tradi establishment and simultaneously supplemented more adequate experiments in typical drought events to examine the performance of tradi 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the continental united states conus divided into 344 climate divisions was selected as our study area the conus covers the area within 24 50 n and 66 126 w and is dominated by different climates such as the continental climate in the north central plains the subtropical climate in the southern regions the temperature climate in the northeast and the semiarid climate in the west as shown in fig 1 the forests including evergreen and deciduous forests are mainly distributed in western southeastern and northeastern regions the shrublands and grasslands are located in the western regions the croplands marked with reddish brown are mainly in the central plains 2 2 data to calculate the different drought indices multi source data products were selected including modis version 6 mod09ga and mod11a1 trmm 3b43 and gldas version 2 1 among them the mod09ga was used to build the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi while the day time lst was selected from mod11a1 besides soil moisture and precipitation data were obtained from the gldas 2 1 and trmm 3b43 respectively all the data above have the period of 2001 to 2019 and only the growing season april to october is considered for each year this is due to two considerations firstly in the months outside the growing season some areas of the conus are covered with snow and ice which will bring uncertainty to the index establishment secondly this study focuses on the response of vegetation to drought during growth the ndvi was calculated based on the red and near infrared bands of mod09ga with daily temporal resolution and 500 m spatial resolution zhang et al 2022a considering the noise caused by cloud coverage monthly composition was performed after removing the cloudy pixels finally the monthly ndvi was resampled from 500 m to 1 km resolution like the ndvi day time lst obtained from mod11a1 was preprocessed through a similar process including cloudy pixel removal and monthly composition since the spatial resolution of mod11a1 is 1 km already this product was not resampled the gldas 2 1 is a climate simulation product merging station based and satellite based observations through data assimilation algorithms it contains more than 35 sub products such as albedo evapotranspiration wind speed soil moisture etc its soil moisture products have been frequently used in drought monitoring hoffmann et al 2020 liu et al 2020 zhang et al 2017b in this study soil moisture at the depth of 0 10 cm was selected the spatial resolution of selected soil moisture was unified to 1 km and the temporal resolution was aggregated to 1 month to monitor precipitation deficits precipitation data were obtained from trmm 3b43 which is an integrated product derived from multiple microwave satellites the 3b43 dataset provided precipitation rate mm hr rather than monthly accumulated precipitation mm therefore before the spatial resolution was resampled to 1 km the data conversion was conducted by multiplying the precipitation rate by the total hours of the corresponding month in addition yearly land cover maps from 2001 to 2019 were provided by the modis mcd12q1 v6 product based on international geosphere biosphere programme igbp classification the igbp has 17 types of land cover in the conus to simplify the analysis the igbp was reclassified into six broad categories in this study i e forest shrublands grasslands croplands water and built up and barren pdsi is one of the most classical and widely used indices for drought monitoring in the united states and it has a solid physical mechanism based on water balance theory aiken and rauscher 2020 biondi and meko 2019 tian et al 2018 thus this study selected the monthly in situ pdsi during the growing season from 2001 to 2019 as our reference data the divisional pdsi of the 344 climate divisions was accessed from the nclimdiv dataset of the national centers for environmental information ncei https www ncei noaa gov the pdsi was chosen for two purposes firstly the pdsi of the driest year was used to decompose the response factors of different vegetation secondly it was used to quantitatively evaluate the performance of the proposed tradi in other dry years in addition to pdsi monthly in situ precipitation from ncei was also obtained the divisional precipitation was used to build spis with continuous scales 1 month to 24 months and further assess the lagged time of the tradi the calculation of spi is based on the algorithm proposed by mckee et al 1993 for qualitative evaluation the maps of the united states drought monitor usdm https droughtmonitor unl edu were collected the usdm releases weekly drought maps with five drought degrees d0 abnormally dry d1 moderatedrought d2 severedrought d3 extremedrought and d4 exceptionaldrought in this study the map closest to the 15th of the calendar month was selected as the representative of the overall drought condition of that month all data used in this study are detailed in table 1 3 methods fig 2 shows the framework of this study firstly multi source products were preprocessed to obtain monthly basic datasets with 1 km resolution i e ndvi lst soil moisture and precipitation and then the 19 year four basic datasets were calculated separately into four single drought indices in section 3 1 according to the percentage of drought affected areas monitored by usdm from 2001 to 2019 as shown in fig s1 several extremely severe drought events occurred in the conus such as droughts in 2002 2004 2006 2007 2011 2015 and 2018 in particular the drought event in 2012 was the most serious both in terms of the affected area and the severity thus the pdsi and land cover map in 2012 were used to decompose response factors of different vegetation types from different single indices detailed steps about this part are then presented in section 3 2 then in section 3 3 based on the response factors obtained four single indices and three linearly integrated indices were reconstructed and the seven indices were further integrated to establish the tradi by principal component analysis pca algorithm information about tradi construction is described in detail in the following sections 3 1 drought index calculation this part presents the construction of multiple drought indices detailed information on single indices including tci smci pci and vci and combined indices including vhi sdci midi and idmi is provided in table 2 these single indices can reveal drought conditions from the perspectives of vegetation evapotranspiration soil and precipitation but if they are applied alone the drought cannot be fully depicted tian et al 2020 vhi sdci and midi are typical examples of combined indices that integrate multiple single indices to provide comprehensive drought monitoring guo et al 2019 zhang et al 2022b these three combined indices greatly contributed to the development of drought indices albeit in a linear combination based approach in this study the four single indices as well as three linearly combined indices were selected to be incorporated into the tradi while the idmi was used to evaluate the performance of tradi 3 2 response factors decomposition in this study the drought process was divided into two sub processes 1 from physical dry conditions to drought stress and 2 from drought stress to drought impacts fig s2 accordingly the four single indices were classified into two categories tci smci pci and vci the first category was used to indicate the intensity of physical dry conditions from different perspectives while the second was to measure the drought s impacts on vegetation drought stress here is a hypothetical virtual parameter which is the result of physical dry conditions and the direct cause of vegetation destruction we introduced drought stress to make the whole drought process clearer and more specific vegetation always exchanges energy e g heat and material e g water with the environment and affects the surrounding microclimate during its growth yin et al 2022 besides in the long term natural process without human intervention precipitation and other climatic factors dominate the land cover types strack et al 2008 wang et al 2021a for example areas with deficient precipitation have sparse vegetation while areas with abundant precipitation are mainly covered with forests grass and crops since there is a close interaction between vegetation and its surrounding environment it is necessary to explore the drought response mechanism of vegetation in different environmental variables throughout the drought process thus in this study each single index was decomposed separately to retrieve response factors of different vegetation types 3 2 1 response factors in the 1st subprocess to avoid repetition we took tci as the representative of tci smci pci to introduce the response factor calculation in the first subprocess theoretically the tci ranges from 0 to 1 with lower tci values indicating more severe temperature anomalies furthermore in vegetation areas the temperature is regulated by vegetation hence we defined the temperature anomaly induced drought stress as ds the degree of temperature anomaly as 1 t c i and the vegetation factor as ω then we adopted a linear model to bridge these parameters and proposed a drought stress equation 1 ds 1 t c i ω ε where ε refers to a noise term and can be ignored in practical applications the physical mechanism of this equation is that the drought stress ds resulting from temperature anomalies is dominated by both the thermal conditions 1 t c i and vegetation effects ω there are two advantages to selecting a linear model firstly the linear model is simpler than nonlinear models which is beneficial to the transferable applications in other drought prone regions secondly the linear model is beneficial to the subsequent procedures including the construction and decomposition of the overdetermined equations for each climate division we assume that there are n f pixels of forests n s pixels of shrublands n g pixels of grasslands and n c pixels of croplands then the mean drought stress for each division can be defined as 2 d s mean ω f i 1 n f 1 t c i f ω s i 1 n s 1 t c i s ω g i 1 n g 1 t c i g ω c i 1 n c 1 t c i c n f n s n g n c where ω f ω s ω g and ω c represent the response factors of forests shrublands grasslands and croplands respectively the tc i f tc i s tc i g and tc i c represent the tci pixel values of forests shrublands grasslands and croplands respectively since the pdsi has a solid physical mechanism and is based on the supply and demand concept of water balance we adopted this index to replace the drought stress ds the pdsi data is provided in units of climate divisions by the ncei thus the mean drought stress and the divisional pdsi can be bridged 3 d s mean 1 n o r m pdsi where n o r m pdsi is the normalization of pdsi data generally more severe droughts tend to cause vegetation to have a larger response amplitude which is more conducive to the decomposition of response factors in this study we selected the pdsi in 2012 as the drought stress data because the drought event in 2012 is the most severe from 2001 to 2019 fig s1 considering that there are 344 climate divisions in the conus and seven months april to october were concerned in each year we constructed a total of 344 7 2408 equations in 2012 4 i 1 n f 1 t c i f 1 i 1 n s 1 t c i s 1 i 1 n g 1 t c i g 1 i 1 n c 1 t c i c 1 i 1 n f 1 t c i f j i 1 n s 1 t c i s j i 1 n g 1 t c i g j i 1 n c 1 t c i c j i 1 n f 1 t c i f 2408 i 1 n s 1 t c i s 2408 i 1 n g 1 t c i g 2408 i 1 n c 1 t c i c 2408 ω f ω s ω g ω c n 1 1 n o r m pdsi 1 n j 1 n o r m pdsi j n 2408 1 n o r m pdsi 2408 where j represents the jth equation of the 2408 equations and n j represents the total number of vegetation pixels in corresponding climate divisions finally the response factors were decomposed from eq 4 based on the least square method lsm response factors from smci and pci can also be obtained in a similar way to that of tci 3 2 2 response factors in the 2nd subprocess drought stress hinders the growth of vegetation and causes vegetation destruction in this study as shown in fig s2 vegetation destruction mainly refers to the impact of drought stress on vegetation health and the impact can be reflected in the changes of spectral characteristics such as the decrease in vci values moreover due to the difference in drought vulnerability vegetation has diverse performance under drought stress thus in the second subprocess we proposed a vegetation drought response equation 5 1 v c i d s ω ε where 1 v c i refers to the drought stress induced decrease in vci here it should be noted that we assumed that water condition deficits were the only reason for vci decline the physical mechanism of this equation is that when subjected to drought stress ds vegetational response ds ω is displayed as a decrease in vegetation index 1 v c i based on the pdsi data from april to october 2012 2408 equations in eq 6 were established then the response factors of different vegetation were calculated through least square method 6 i 1 n f 1 v c i f 1 i 1 n s 1 v c i s 1 i 1 n g 1 v c i g 1 i 1 n c 1 v c i c 1 i 1 n f 1 v c i f j i 1 n s 1 v c i s j i 1 n g 1 v c i g j i 1 n c 1 v c i c j i 1 n f 1 v c i f 2408 i 1 n s 1 v c i s 2408 i 1 n g 1 v c i g 2408 i 1 n c 1 v c i c 2408 1 ω f 1 ω s 1 ω g 1 ω c n 1 1 n o r m pdsi 1 n j 1 n o r m pdsi j n 2408 1 n o r m pdsi 2408 3 3 tradi establishment based on the vegetation factors in section 3 2 the drought stress in other dry years was further derived in each pixel by back substituting the response factors into the drought stress equation and the vegetation drought response equation using the corresponding land cover maps in general a smaller index value usually indicated a more severe drought therefore we added a negative sign to these two equations to make the constructed drought stress consistent with the existing drought indices the predicted drought stress based on tci can be defined as 7 d s tci 1 t c i ω where the d s tci above can be regarded as a fine tuned form of tci through the same process drought stress of other single indices can also be obtained i e d s smci and d s pci similarly predicted drought stress based on vci is presented in eq 8 furthermore traditional combined indices were reconstructed by blending fine tuned single indices such as the d s vhi d s sdci d s midi 8 d s vci 1 v c i 1 ω the final step of constructing the tradi is to integrate drought stress from multiple dimensions this study chose the principal component analysis pca to fuse the reconstructed indices above pca is an unsupervised method which can integrate the information of multiple indices without prior knowledge and it has been widely used in the synthesis of comprehensive indices arun kumar et al 2021 chang et al 2022 jiao et al 2019 different from the traditional combined indices that only focus on the fusion of single indices tradi also considers the potential of existing combined indices the tradi aims to assimilate multi dimensional drought characteristics from single indices and extract additional prior information from existing combined indices in this study seven reconstructed indices were all integrated through eq 9 and the first principal component pc1 was selected as the proposed tradi 9 tradi p c a d s vci d s tci d s smci d s pci d s vhi d s sdci d s midi the response factors of different vegetation types were validated on both single indices and combined indices by performing the pearson correlation analysis between different drought indices and pdsi data in other dry years except 2012 additionally the combined index idmi was constructed and the usdm was obtained to quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate the performance of tradi 4 results and discussions 4 1 decomposing response factors for different vegetation through least square method response factors of different vegetation types were decomposed and the decomposition was respectively performed on four widely used single indices including tci smci pci and vci detailed results are illustrated in fig 3 the response factors from the four indices were all below 1 with a range of 0 82 to 0 98 for tci 0 71 to 0 95 for smci 0 72 to 0 87 for pci and 0 89 to 0 99 for vci respectively although all response factors are less than 1 0 they have different meanings for different indices for tci smci and pci a response value less than 1 0 indicated that in vegetative areas drought stress caused by anomalous temperature insufficient soil water and deficient precipitation could be slightly alleviated in other words the drought intensity exhibited by these physical conditions was worse than the drought stress suffered by vegetation while for vci the response results suggested that drought stress is not equivalent to drought impact and the drought impact reflected in vegetation indices is often weaker than the intensity of drought stress according to the drought stress equation and the vegetation drought response equation a response factor close to 1 0 means that the physical dry conditions or the drought effects are consistent with the drought stress suffered by vegetation such as the factors of shrublands and grasslands in tci fig 3 a and croplands in vci fig 3 d in all the subplots a d of fig 3 the forest response factor is the smallest among all vegetation types implying that the forest system is tolerant in the process of drought duration not only in the stage from physical dry conditions to drought stress but also in the stage from drought stress to vegetation destruction this phenomenon is probably due to the developed roots of trees in forest areas and their insensitivity to drought croplands showed low response weights in tci smci and pci but a high weight in vci suggesting that physical dry conditions in agricultural areas had a relatively low rate of conversion to drought stress while drought stress had a higher rate of conversion to drought effects the characteristics of crops and agricultural management might explain this difference crops were vulnerable and sensitive to drought stress but irrigation and other water management measures alleviated the conversion from dry conditions to drought stress the retrieved vegetation factors are of great significance not only for the comparison of vegetation vulnerability but also for the analysis of drought evolution 4 2 validation of response factors 4 2 1 validation on single indices sis to evaluate the effectiveness of response factors we quantitatively compared the predicted drought stress and corresponding single indices in pearson correlation coefficients with in situ pdsi data based on the time series of drought exposure from usdm this section focused on the dry years in 2002 2004 2006 2007 2011 2013 2015 and 2018 the results of the correlation coefficients are shown in table 3 in all the listed dry years the predicted drought stress achieved better performance than the original single indices except for the comparison of vci pairs in 2003 and 2006 although the correlation coefficients between smci and pdsi were usually the highest the improvement after incorporating vegetation responses was the most significant in tci fig 4 the correlation coefficient improvement ranged from 0 012 to 0 053 in tci pairs from 0 010 to 0 042 in smci pairs from 0 005 to 0 036 in pci pairs and from 0 006 to 0 027 in vci pairs among the four index pairs the improvement in vci was the slightest this may be because the process from drought stress to drought impact is more complex than that from physical dry conditions to drought stress in addition the improvement in pci is also relatively slight many factors might account for this on the one hand pci is a meteorological index for monitoring precipitation deficits but insufficient precipitation is not the only reason for drought stress temperature anomalies soil water shortages and even atmospheric vapor pressure deficits are the potential inducements of drought stress kimm et al 2020 on the other hand part of precipitation forms surface runoff rather than infiltration into the soil which can lead to the pci underestimating drought intensity overall all the single indices showed increased correlation coefficients with pdsi after being adjusted by vegetation factors indicating that considering vegetation response in the drought process is promising for both drought index modification and drought monitoring 4 2 2 validation on combined indices cis the role of vegetation response on single indices has been evaluated and its performance on combined indices is further discussed in this section we selected four widely used combined indices including three linearly weighted indices i e vhi sdci midi and one pca based index i e idmi fig 5 shows the correlations between different indices and in situ pdsi from 2001 to 2019 in fig 5 sdci and midi were obtained by the linear combination of three single indices and they got better performances than the vhi which was built only by vci and tci additionally the pca based idmi established by the fusion of four indices was the best among the other three combined indices due to the complexity of drought the ability of a single index to characterize drought is limited zhang et al 2017b however multidimensional data can complement each other from different perspectives and provide a comprehensive description of droughts chang et al 2022 liu et al 2020 sánchez et al 2018 besides since a combined index is designed by optimizing the combination of different single indices and assigning their weights it can provide additional prior information for drought monitoring jiao et al 2019 compared with the corresponding original index the derived drought stress was more correlated with pdsi in most cases this result suggested that response factors contributed not only to single indices but also to combined indices besides the universal improvements revealed that vegetation response factors could be applied to other drought monitoring applications in fig 5 all four indices showed a significant improvement in most drought events except in 2005 2010 2016 and 2019 for example in 2005 sdci and d s sdci were equal in correlation coefficient with in situ pdsi in 2005 2010 2016 and 2019 the d s idmi showed decreased coefficients compared with the original idmi according to the usdm fig s1 these years were relatively humid thus this phenomenon was probably because single indices slightly fluctuated under a normal threshold in humid conditions and the 1 v c i or 1 t c i overestimated drought stress drought indices are generally proposed to indicate drought intensity in a drought event not in humid cases therefore from this point of view the benefits of vegetation response factors may outweigh the accompanying disadvantages 4 3 evaluation of tradi performance to provide comprehensive monitoring of drought and eliminate weak performance under humid conditions the tradi was established by integrating four single indices and three combined indices in this section the drought category definition of tradi was first introduced and then we performed a comprehensive assessment of tradi specifically vhi sdci midi and idmi were adopted to quantitatively compare the tradi performance and multi scale spis were calculated to evaluate its time lag effect additionally tradi was qualitatively assessed in typical dry years with the usdm maps 4 3 1 drought classification in tradi in usdm drought was classified into 6 levels based on its historical frequency distributions including none no drought d0 abnormally dry d1 moderate drought d2 severe drought d3 extreme drought and d4 exceptional drought li et al 2022 xu et al 2022 the classification thresholds for usdm were 2 5 10 20 and 30 xu et al 2020 to be consistent with usdm we also classified tradi into 6 types the historical and cumulative frequency of tradi from 2001 to 2019 is illustrated in fig 6 and the drought classification is shown in table 4 the percentile for tradi is 1 97 for d4 4 86 for d3 11 53 for d2 21 60 for d1 and 31 21 for d0 respectively the corresponding index threshold is 0 95 0 80 0 60 0 40 and 0 25 respectively 4 3 2 feasibility of obtaining tradi from pca as the tradi is the first principal component after pca method whether it covers the main information of the original data needs to be tested and the degree of eigenvalue separation also needs to be evaluated fig 7 shows the percentage of total variance explained by each principal component in each month april to october from 2001 to 2019 the percentage of total variance ranges from 40 to 75 in pc1 15 to 35 in pc2 5 to 20 in pc3 2 to 10 in pc4 and nearly zero in pc5 7 in most months during the study period the first principal component covers the main information with an average percentage of 60 in addition the north method north et al 1982 was adopted to test the separation of eigenvalues the north test tells us that if λ 1 δ λ 1 λ 2 in fig 8 we can say that the first principal component is significantly separated from the second as shown in fig 8 except for a few months when separation was not significant the two principal components passed the north test in most months during the study period 4 3 3 comparison with combined indices since the tradi was obtained from the integration of seven fine tuned drought indices eq 9 this section evaluated it from two perspectives firstly the tradi was compared with the modified idmi i e a combination of four fine tuned single indices to examine the contributions of three linearly combined indices secondly we evaluated the tradi s performance with the original combined drought indices in each year from 2001 to 2019 the results are illustrated in fig 9 the ds idmi in fig 5 showed significant improvement above the original idmi but its performance in wet years was unsatisfactory compared with ds idmi the proposed tradi presented a closer relation to drought in these years fig 9 a specifically its coefficients are 0 525 0 096 in 2005 0 621 0 094 in 2010 0 594 0 092 in 2016 and 0 518 0 028 in 2019 these results suggested that existing combined indices were helpful for establishing a more complex integrated index as they could supplement necessary prior drought information in index integration rhee et al 2010 in comparison with common combined indices tradi exhibited the best performance in almost all years during the study period fig 9 b the order of combined index performance from good to bad was tradi idmi sdci or midi vhi the vhi consisted of only two single indices so the correlation coefficients were relatively low while sdci and midi generally outperformed vhi probably because they blended drought information from three dimensions table 2 in addition the superiority of idmi and tradi might lie in the integration of drought information from four perspectives arun kumar et al 2021 despite the remarkable performance of idmi we did not incorporate it into tradi construction but selected three linearly weighted indices vhi sdci and midi which could reduce the algorithm complexity of tradi hao and singh 2015 4 3 4 comparison with usdm the monthly spatial distribution of tradi was qualitatively compared with usdm in two extremely dry years 2011 and 2012 and one less dry year 2019 among them the drought in 2011 was extremely serious with the highest percentage of drought affected areas at the d4 level while the 2012 drought had the largest percentage of total affected areas throughout the entire study period rippey 2015 wang et al 2015 compared with 2011 and 2012 the drought in 2019 was relatively mild and could be selected to evaluate tradi from a different perspective schubert et al 2021 the results are illustrated in fig 10 for the 2011 drought usdm indicated that drought affected areas were mainly concentrated in the southern areas of conus such as texas oklahoma new mexico and so on and showed a trend of gradual expansion in space the drought began to intensify in may 2011 and covered florida georgia and other areas near the gulf of mexico then in august the drought condition near the gulf of mexico began to slow down the tradi well captured the spatial patterns of the 2011 drought and showed similar results to usdm especially in texas oklahoma and new mexico while in florida georgia and alabama the performance of tradi is unstable tradi could accurately indicate the drought conditions of these areas from april to june but tended to underestimate their drought severity from july to october the reason is that these areas have a humid climate and the performance of tradi is limited in humid conditions according to usdm the drought in 2012 mainly originated in the southwest of the conus from april to october drought conditions gradually deteriorated and the drought center shifted from the southwest to the center of the great plains the spatial propagation of the 2012 drought was well tracked by tradi before july the drought center was located in the southwest and from july drought in the southwestern states such as new mexico and western texas was alleviated while the central conus began to suffer extreme drought conditions moreover as the drought center moved drought severity depicted an increasing trend as well as drought coverage compare with 2011 and 2012 the drought in 2019 was mild with only a few areas suffering drought conditions although the drought intensified in august the worst hit areas in texas were with a drought level weaker than d3 in the development of the 2019 drought from august to october tradi well revealed the drought in texas the southwest and southeast of conus schubert et al 2021 compared with usdm the tradi was more sensitive and showed a wider coverage encompassing the areas indicated by usdm so it might be suitable for the drought early warning system although tradi can illustrate the spatiotemporal drought patterns and capture the shift of drought gravity center its performance in some areas is different from that of usdm such as the misestimate in several months in 2012 and 2019 this is probably due to the following two reasons firstly the tradi in this study involves four datasets and seven derived drought indices while usdm integrates local expert experience and incorporates more than 70 indicators svoboda et al 2002 including precipitation temperature soil moisture streamflow vapor pressure deficit streamflow etc the multidimensional data can provide drought information from multiple perspectives and enable usdm to monitor drought conditions comprehensively kuwayama et al 2019 leeper et al 2022 secondly whether hydrological drought is considered is the other difference between usdm and tradi the tradi is built by integrating several drought indices which have been modified by vegetation response factors and the response factors of different vegetation types are obtained from the overdetermined equations for the four single drought indices i e vci tci smci and pci and pdsi among these four basic indices tci smci and pci represent physical drought conditions while the vci represents the drought impact on vegetation growth the four indices cover meteorological and agricultural drought rather than hydrological drought as for the usdm hydrological indicators including streamflow and water level of the reservoir and lake are all incorporated into the usdm system future studies need to focus on incorporating more multi source datasets and considering multiple drought types to construct multi faceted products comparable to usdm 4 3 5 time lag effects evaluation to assess the time lag effects of tradi on meteorological drought correlation coefficients between tradi and multi scale spis were calculated the major benefit of spi is its ability to be derived on any given time scale facilitating the monitoring of short and long term anomalies in water resources huang et al 2015 therefore an approximate time scale of the spi can be viewed as the lag time of the drought index in response to meteorological drought huang et al 2015 in this study the spi with multiple scales one month to 24 months was calculated based on the algorithm proposed by mckee et al 1993 as shown in fig 11 tradi is highly correlated with short term spis especially spi 1 r 0 661 and spi 2 r 0 665 and shows a trend of decreasing correlation as the spi scale increases in different climate divisions as shown in fig 12 the lagged timesale between tradi and spi is mainly from one month to three months moreover according to the land cover map in fig 1 tradi and spi 1 achieved the highest coefficient in the southwest northeast and southeast of the conus mainly covered by forests crops and shrubs while in the central conus where the terrain type is mainly grassland tradi got the highest coefficients with spi 2 spi is a standard index of meteorological drought rashid and beecham 2019 wang et al 2020 while the tradi in this study is proposed to monitor the drought stress induced by physical dry conditions there is a lag in the progression from meteorological drought to drought stress and the lagged time is nearly 2 months more specifically between one month and three months however due to data limitations this study only conducted a monthly analysis more accurate lagged time may need to be determined in future work on a sub monthly or weekly scale 4 4 uncertainties the decomposition of vegetation response factors was based on the data from 2012 as the drought in 2012 was the most severe which is favorable for response decomposition however it should be noted that the complexity of the 2012 drought might bring uncertainties to the whole construction process of tradi fig 13 shows the monthly fluctuations of four basic parameters lst soil moisture precipitation and ndvi in 2012 and the mean fluctuations of these parameters over the period from 2001 to 2019 theoretically when drought occurs these parameters deviate from their normal state for example the values of precipitation soil moisture and vegetation index decrease while the values of temperature increase nevertheless as shown in fig 13 d ndvi presented a negative deviation from june to october while a positive deviation in april and may this may be due to the advancement of vegetation phenophase during the early stage of the 2012 drought event in the early drought stage clear and cloudless weather improved vegetation s reception of solar radiation and as a result increased vegetation index the phenomenon is consistent with existing studies for instance yue et al 2015 probed the past 30 year phenology trend of us deciduous forests and found that the vegetation phenology in 2012 was significantly ahead of other years moreover qiu et al 2022 observed an earlier peak of vegetation activity in 2012 using solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence sif data vci is built by normalizing the ndvi values of each month and the earlier phenology period can cause the vci to underestimate drought severity in april and may in this study drought induced vegetation loss was defined as 1 v c i thereby the earlier phenology period further contributed to the overestimation of vegetation response factors however we used the data for multiple months from april to october which could alleviate this uncertainty to some extent additionally another uncertainty lies in the type of vegetation in this study the 17 types of land cover in igbp products were reclassified into 6 major categories including 4 vegetation categories forests shrublands grasslands and croplands however the diversity of subcategories within each vegetation category may also play an important role for example the seasonal fluctuation of ndvi in the evergreen forest is essentially different from that in the deciduous forest although the tradi framework preliminarily explored the diverse responses of major vegetation types a finer investigation would be beneficial for a deeper and clearer understanding of the drought process future research should pay more attention to the vegetation response in fine grained land cover classification apart from the above uncertainties other factors might also influence the results for example the datasets used in this study cover 2001 2019 and the time series is a little short which may lead to uncertainty in the calculation of condition indices in addition data source data resolution and the selection of single condition indices may also bring errors to the vegetation response factor decomposition and tradi establishment 5 conclusion understanding the role of vegetation in drought process is significant for drought monitoring and drought mitigation in this study we introduced drought stress to bridge physical dry conditions and drought induced vegetation damage and modeled the drought process as two sub processes response factors for four types of vegetation trees grasses shrubs and crops were decomposed from the basic drought indices tci smci pci and vci and were used to adjust the commonly used drought indices based on the adjusted indices and the principal component analysis pca a new integrated index tradi was proposed the main conclusions are as follows 1 in the two sub processes the response factors of the four types of vegetation are all less than 1 0 indicating that vegetation can alleviate the impact of drought during the propagation process from physical dry conditions to vegetation destruction forests in particular achieved the lowest response value suggesting that trees were the most drought tolerant compared with other land cover types 2 after being adjusted by response factors both single indices and combined indices show a closer correlation with pdsi revealing that it is necessary to consider the contribution of different vegetation in drought index establishment moreover the improvement due to response factors is more significant in dry years 3 compared with several commonly used combined indices vhi sdci midi and idmi the tradi exhibited the best performance in almost all years from 2001 to 2019 indicating the reliability and robustness of tradi 4 in qualitative comparison with the comprehensive product usdm tradi showed consistency with usdm in 2011 but inconsistency in some months of 2012 and 2019 which is probably due to the lack of information on hydrological dimension thus hydrological indicators such as streamflow water levels in rivers and lakes and runoff should be incorporated in future studies to improve the ability of tradi in comprehensive drought monitoring credit authorship contribution statement guoying yin conceptualization

2249,integrity failure of wells in gas resource developments poses a potential risk to groundwater resource quality and quantity by enhancing the connectivity and fluid migration between a gas reservoir and overlying aquifers which may support groundwater dependent ecosystems or be used as a water source this study assessed the potential for impact on groundwater resources from flow pathways created by well integrity failure in decommissioned coal seam gas csg wells deep water bores or gas wells repurposed as water bores and legacy coal exploration drillholes using an example based on a proposed csg development near narrabri australia the study only considered the flow of water a multi stage screening method for likelihood and consequence assessment was used which included i a semi quantitative risk prioritisation of potential pathways for inter aquifer leakage and development of metrics for impact assessment ii assessment of the consequences of each of these pathways through an analytical model and iii numerical groundwater modelling of single and multiple leaky wells all three approaches indicated that increases in inter aquifer leakage drawdown in upper aquifers are not likely to be significant for high flow leaky gas wells effective well conductivity kw 10 1 m d based on conditions reported in previous studies and for the case study it is theoretically possible that extremely high flow leaky wells kw 102 m d could have an impact where aquitard conductivity is 10 4 m d or less or well failure density is higher than 1 well per km2 however kw values for compromised gas wells of 1 m d have not been identified in previous studies the most extreme case tested open legacy coal exploration drillholes or petroleum bores repurposed into water bores across an aquitard should it occur has the potential to deplete or contaminate groundwater resources in connected aquifers the magnitude of which will depend on aquifer and production zone transmissivity however current australian regulations for petroleum exploration make this an extremely unlikely case more effort is required to determine kw and failure rates of gas wells water bores and exploration drillholes in australian conditions to better quantify the potential risks associated with leaking infrastructure keywords well integrity well failure coal seam gas impact assessment effective well conductivity groundwater resources data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the impact of natural gas resource development on groundwater resources is an area of concern in australia and worldwide cui et al 2018 sreekanth et al 2020 vengosh et al 2014 vidic et al 2013 in australia gas developments consist of conventional gas where gas is held in reservoirs within a porous rock matrix typically overlain by a low permeability caprock and coal seam gas csg also known as coal bed methane in us and canada hamawand et al 2013 towler et al 2016 where gas is held within coal seams that occur between 300 m and 1000 m below the ground surface mallants et al 2018 shale gas or tight gas resources in sedimentary shales and very low permeability sandstones and limestones respectively occurring between 1500 m and 4000 m below the ground surface are currently being explored with some early production trials geoscience australia 2015 geoscience australia 2021 production of conventional gas involves drilling to a gas reservoir and extracting gas and water through cement and steel lined wells generally through the buoyancy effects of the gas production of shale gas or tight gas generally requires hydraulic fracture stimulation to produce gas at economic rates and quantities production of coal seam gas which is trapped within coal seams requires water levels in the coal seams to be reduced to allow the gas to desorb from the coal csg development may also involve an initial hydraulic fracture stimulation of the coal seams to enhance permeability for gas flow although to date only 6 of wells in productive australian csg fields in the bowen and surat basins in queensland have required stimulation mallants et al 2018a after gas production ceases gas wells are required to be sealed and capped with cement and the pore fluid pressures in the coal seams gradually recover to pre production levels over the course of up to several hundreds of years cook et al 2016 there is a potential hazard from leaky wells on groundwater and groundwater dependent ecosystems because gas wells perforate the caprock that separates the coal or gas resource from overlying aquifers that may support groundwater dependent ecosystems or be used for water sources well integrity failure through failures of all well barriers at a location has the potential to accelerate inter aquifer leakage by providing direct pathways through leaky wells jackson 2014 in some instances decommissioned gas wells have been repurposed into water bores which pose similar potential hazards to groundwater resources from inter aquifer leakage dnrm 2013 however the likelihood and magnitude of impacts on groundwater from accelerated inter aquifer leakage through wells is unclear potential impacts on aquifers include changes to groundwater quantity and quality inter aquifer leakage may result in drawdown of surficial aquifers where the flux as a result of gas resource depressurisation is downward doble et al 2016 potential contamination of aquifers through groundwater influx from more saline aquifers or from hydrocarbons or residual drilling fluid around the production zone may also occur mallants et al 2018a this paper assesses potential changes in aquifer heads resulting from various scenarios of leaky wells connecting aquifers and deeper developed coal seams a complementary assessment of the potential impacts on the salinity of overlying aquifers due to upwards leakage from more saline deeper aquifers is provided in the supplementary material risks to water resources from gas developments either through dewatering or contamination have been studied using semi quantitative analyses analytical analyses and numerical modelling but very few studies have specifically looked at water leakage through degraded or compromised wells there have been some research efforts in the conceptually similar co2 sequestration space which have been included in reviews of literature for this paper the main point of difference is that environmental impacts from co2 sequestering wells are usually defined as the movement of gas rather than liquid between aquifers or to the surface semi quantitative reviews of the risks of gas and oil developments in australia have most recently been represented by mallants et al 2018a and shanafield et al 2018 and in the bioregional assessments 1 1 https www bioregionalassessments gov au bioregional assessment program and geological and bioregional assessments 2 2 https www bioregionalassessments gov au gba programs the mallants et al 2018a analysis focused on csg production while the shanafield et al 2018 analysis included three types of unconventional gas sources coal seam shale and tight gas mallants et al 2018a reviewed plausible chemical migration pathways in australian csg developments for all plausible risks including surface handling of hydraulic fracturing fluid drilling and construction of wells faults and fractures and leaky wells the review found that pathways with highest relative risks relating to an absolute risk of around 1 or less included surface handling of fracturing fluids and poor integrity of gas and oil wells old water bores and coal exploration bores but that there was limited information for well integrity failure rates and effective well conductivity in australian conditions the potential contamination pathways included in the shanafield et al 2018 review were surface spills inter aquifer leakage through the aquitard during hydraulic fracturing inter aquifer leakage through the aquitard after production ceases and depletion of shallow aquifers from production water requirements leakage through compromised and corroded wells was only assessed during hydraulic fracturing shanafield et al 2018 concluded that the pathway with the highest risk was surface handling of chemicals analytical analyses have been used to predict inter aquifer flow from gas development across a broad but plausible parameter space cook et al 2016 developed analytical solutions to estimate induced flow through the aquitards that separate aquifers and gas production zones due to increases or decreases in pressure during gas production this analysis did not include flow through wells and other local pathways nordbotten et al 2004 developed analytical solutions for passive leakage of an aqueous liquid through wells for geological sequestration of co2 they calculated passive leakage using an expression based on darcy s law and use a convolution integral to account for well flow varying with time and temporally varying heads due to changes in flow rates through the injection wells numerical modelling has been used for more detailed evaluation of well leakage rates in the oil and petroleum research sector modelling of leakage through wells has most commonly been undertaken using multi phase flow models such as eclipse schlumberger 2011 dumux flemisch et al 2011 or tough realgash2o simulator moridis and freeman 2014 similar well integrity studies have been reported from gas migration simulations related to geological co2 sequestration lewicki et al 2007 nordbotten et al 2009 some studies used multi phase flow models to estimate the potential effects of gas wells on overlying aquifers kissinger et al 2013 nowamooz et al 2015 reagan et al 2015 these studies however were primarily focused on gas migration rather than inter aquifer leakage of water in moving from semi quantitative analyses to analytical assessment and full numerical assessment there is an increase in quantitative certainty about the potential impacts of gas wells on groundwater condition through various hydraulic or contaminant transport pathways but also an increase in computational effort rather than modelling all combinations of development scenarios and pathways screening approaches allow those pathways that are highly unlikely to affect groundwater condition to be excluded from numerical testing significantly reducing the number of numerical assessments required in this paper we aim to systematically assess the potential effects of inter aquifer flow on groundwater head through a series of potential pathways associated with leaky wells we use a multi stage screening method combining three different lines of evidence to assess the potential impacts on groundwater heads from inter aquifer leakage through compromised gas wells and water bores we first present the three methods that comprise the staged impact assessment a semi quantitative risk prioritisation of potential pathways followed by a quantitative assessment using an analytical model and finally a numerical modelling based assessment with single well and multiple well conceptualisations we apply the methodology to a case study area in a csg basin in australia the modelling approaches use single phase analytical and numerical groundwater models as a conservative approach to modelling the effects of enhanced depressurisation from inter aquifer leakage on groundwater resources the assessment is limited to the impacts of groundwater leakage on groundwater head in the post production phase where the production zone is recovering from depressurisation and the likelihood of severe well degradation is higher we do not assess the potential impacts from short term stimulation induced high pressures on fluid flow through a compromised well annulus rather our study is concerned with the changes in groundwater heads in overlying aquifers used for water resources purposes as a result of long term well degradation fig 1 2 case study site description the proposed csg development area used as an example in the assessment is approximately 957 km2 in size and located near narrabri in the namoi subregion of new south wales australia smith 2016 it consists of 850 proposed production wells on a maximum of 425 well pads with up to 3 wellheads per pad which primarily target the coal seams within the maules creek formation at depths between 500 and 1000 m below surface smith 2014 smith 2016 the maules creek formation has an average total thickness of 125 m in the proposed development area with individual coal seams up to 20 m thick fig 2 it is overlain by a thick sequence of middle permian to jurassic sedimentary rocks which collectively represent an aquitard unit this incorporates the hoskissons coal formation which is the secondary target for csg development this is overlain by a key confined aquifer the pilliga sandstone a key water source for the area the pilliga sandstone is around 114 m thick in the area of investigation doble et al 2018 a multi layer aquitard up to 600 m thick separates the maules creek csg formation from the overlying aquifer the pilliga sandstone crops out to the east of the investigation area and is overlain by the blythesdale group keelindi beds rolling downs group and superficial sediments the pilliga sandstone is part of the great artesian basin gab the largest and deepest artesian basin in the world covering an area of around 1 7 million square kilometres the proposed csg development is on the eastern margin of the gab the other industries that interact with groundwater in the area are coal mining and agriculture in 2016 there were 4 682 registered water bores within 30 km of the proposed site smith 2016 mostly extracting from the piliga sandstone and overlying alluvium approximately 470 coal exploration core holes have been drilled within 30 km of the study area nsw minview stolz 2021 of these 20 are deeper than 300 m and the majority of historical bores did not penetrate multiple aquifers smith 2016 there are 2 petroleum wells that are now registered as a water bore 3 three stage assessment method the three stage assessment method described in this paper consists of 1 qualitative assessment identifying pathways for well integrity failure to impact groundwater resources qualitatively assessing the relevant pathways and assigning a risk priority score 2 system conceptualisation and analytical models establishing appropriate metrics to determine whether impact has occurred and application of closed form analytical expressions to improve system understanding and a priori predict hydrogeological conditions where impact is likely or unlikely 3 numerical models identifying plausible model parameters ranges such as effective well conductivity kw well densities and well integrity failure rates based on previous studies followed by numerical modelling of groundwater head changes or contamination due to well integrity failure for single and multiple wells to confirm outcomes from the analytical assessment the final step also includes reporting pathways that may require more detailed modelling one of the aims of this study is to assess the performance of the screening process each of the pathways identified were assessed at each of the three screening levels even those that would have been flagged as not a priority for more detailed modelling this approach allowed the performance of the screening process to be assessed 4 stage 1 qualitative assessment the first stage in the three stage assessment method is identification of the pathways that may lead to an impact on groundwater head and a qualitative risk assessment of these pathways the aim of this step if to ensure that all plausible pathways have been identified the qualitative assessment allows the pathways to be prioritised for further investigation in subsequent stages 4 1 identifying fluid migration pathways failed or leaky production wells or decommissioned wells within gas development regions have the potential to lead to pathways for inter aquifer leakage the potential for wells with integrity issues will inevitably increase despite improvements in regulatory and operational practices given the exponential growth of unconventional gas production worldwide wells with poor integrity may lead to potential risks of stressing groundwater resources e g depressurisation linked to csg production and groundwater contamination from leakage of saline groundwater into less saline aquifers davies et al 2014 use the terminology of well barrier failure and well integrity failure to describe the failure of a single well barrier along a flow pathway and failure of enough well barriers to create a pathway for inter aquifer flow other reporting standards in the petroleum industry refer to well integrity breaches and hydrogeological breaches to describe the same processes wu et al 2018 often multiple well barrier failures such as both cement and steel casing are required to cause a well integrity failure our assumption is that each pathway described in figs 3 5 results in a well integrity failure where all barriers in a potential leakage pathway fail in a way that a pathway is created king and king 2013 the pathway is defined by the limiting factor smallest effective well conductivity along the pathway for inter aquifer flow assuming that there is a sufficient hydraulic gradient present for flow to occur well age is another factor which appears to influence the likelihood of a well integrity failure the csg resource sector in australia is still relatively young having commenced in 1995 therefore existing csg wells are more likely to have been developed and decommissioned according to higher modern standards and regulatory requirements with changes to state petroleum acts in the 1990s and early 2000s see section 5 3 2 conventional gas has been extracted in australia since the early 1960s and therefore may include much older legacy wells that were either constructed or decommissioned to a lower standard than is required today or have had more time for degradation of steel and cement to take place bannerman et al 2005 kell 2011 these are discussed more fully below additional pathways that could enhance inter aquifer leakage include deep water bores deep uncased coal exploration drillholes co2 sequestration wells faults and fractures water bores with poor integrity include deep water bores 200 m in depth that have multiple screens across different formations some of which occur in coal seam formations mallants et al 2018a some of these water bores are petroleum wells that have been converted to water bores dnrm 2013 and this is still permitted under certain guidelines in queensland business queensland queensland government 2020 although well conversions may not be permitted in other jurisdictions water bores that remain in service well beyond their design lifetime may experience loss of integrity of the casing and potentially result in interconnection of aquifers leading to mixing of different water qualities as an example an analysis of leaky water bores in the angas bremer catchment in south australia indicated that 50 of water bores were not leaking 40 of water bores were leaking at 0 14 m3 day and 10 of water bores were leaking at 2 2 m3 day zulfic and barnett 2007 further pathways that might enhance inter aquifer leakage are those linked to deep uncased exploration drillholes e g for coal mining up to 500 m deep and deep injection wells for co2 geo sequestration around 2000 m deep gaurina međimurec and pašić 2011 the risk associated with uncased exploration drillholes was discussed by mallants et al 2018 and found to be of very low risk based on coal resource data from the eastern australia it is unlikely that coal exploration drillholes will interact with csg developments through hydraulic fracturing due to the spatial and depth separation of coal deposits targeted for mining which are usually 300 m deep and coal seams targeted by csg extraction which are typically deeper than 1000 m risk assessments for deep co2 injection wells can be found in leung et al 2014 and zhang and bachu 2011 to date very few co2 sequestration wells have been developed in australia pathways for gas and water movement through fractures and faults has been investigated in detail in turnadge et al 2018 mccallum et al 2018 underschultz et al 2018 and reviewed in mallants et al 2018b and davies et al 2012 these pathways are not included in this assessment the pathways that were assessed for the case study in this paper are shown in table 1 and included coal exploration drillholes inadequately decommissioned orphan wells wells that no longer have any organisation legally responsible to deal with abandonment responsibilities water bores and decommissioned csg wells that have compromised integrity due to degraded cement and steel or development of flow paths through micro annuli or incomplete cementing these pathways are shown in figs 3 5 wu et al 2018 and are grouped into three general types 1 gas flow through pathways in decommissioned gas production or co2 injection wells wells with a steel casing and cement annulus of which sections are plugged with cement and the wellhead cut off and sealed below the surface on decommissioning pathways include flow through micro annuli as a result of debonding at the cement casing interface or at the cement rock matrix interface through corroded steel casing or incomplete well cementation or through degraded poor well construction or incomplete cement plugs poor well design these would also require a driving force for fluid movement from an over or under pressured aquifer reservoir fig 3 2 wb inter aquifer leakage through i gas wells that have historically been repurposed for water extraction repurposing is not possible under current regulations and policies in new south wales but permitted in queensland business queensland queensland government 2020 and ii deep water bores 200 m with corroded steel casing fig 4 historical conversion may allow aquifer mixing but minimum construction requirements for water bores in australia mcr requires that aquifers should not be able to mix 3 coal flow through coal exploration drillholes which are uncased and depending on their age on decommissioning may be backfilled with the drilled rock material and or capped with a cement plug at the top and have a series of further cement plugs to separate flow between aquifers fig 5 4 2 qualitative risk assessment of pathways a qualitative assessment of the potential risk associated with each pathway was performed using a logarithmic risk analysis framework similar to that used in the australian government bioregional assessments ba program ford et al 2016 this framework was based on the failure modes and effects analysis fmea method for identifying hazards in complex systems with multiple components qualitative risk assessment relies on assumptions of likelihood and consequence many of which are based on pre conceived understanding of a system despite best available information being used where possible this method can be useful for a rapid assessment to screen highly unlikely impact pathways if assumptions are conservative potentially higher impact pathways can be more rigorously tested using multiple lines of evidence the suitability of using a qualitative assessment method for assessing risks from failed bore integrity on groundwater levels was reviewed in section 7 inter aquifer flow pathways that were identified from a review of literature were collated and scored by the authors according to the severity of their potential impacts the likelihood of the pathway occurring and the likelihood of being detected table 1 a risk priority number was calculated from the sum of the severity likelihood and detection scores 1 risk p r i o r i t y n u m b e r s e v e r i t y l i k e l i h o o d d e t e c t i o n the severity score is based on a one unit increase e g from minor to moderate resulting in a tenfold increase in environmental impact the scoring system for likelihood is based on the log of the annual occurrence rate the detection score is based on the log of the time to detection in days the severity likelihood and detection scoring tables are shown in the supplementary material tables s1 s3 in the qualitative risk assessment the assigned severity score was based on whether inter aquifer leakage could be potentially high due to high well conductivity in the case of unlined exploration wells or water bores repurposed from gas wells or a low due to potentially low well conductivity in the case of loss of well integrity due to well corrosion or a delamination within the micro annulus wang and taleghani 2012 likelihood for the pathway to occur was ranked higher in historical repurposed gas wells and legacy exploration wells and lower for deteriorated decommissioned production wells a severe well integrity failure through shear or tensile failure to the casing is more likely to occur during production due to geomechanical processes associated with depressurisation of the formation as wells are routinely monitored during production such a failure is likely to be quickly detected and repaired before decommissioning occurs and is less likely to generate inter aquifer flow in the post production period it was therefore scored low for likelihood re sealing of exploration drillholes is likely at depth where they encounter weaker geological formations mudstones and claystones are present mallants et al 2018a this reduces both the potential severity and likelihood of impact for unsealed drillholes repurposed gas wells were given a low detection score as any contamination of the groundwater should be quickly detected as it is used exploration wells and degraded wells were given medium to high scores as they are likely to take longer to be detected especially for decommissioned wells that are not normally monitored aggregating these scores suggested that legacy coal exploration drillholes had the highest risk priority for investigation with gas wells repurposed into water bores and degraded water bores being the next highest risk to groundwater resources table 1 abandoned exploration gas wells that had been constructed to modern regulatory requirements were found to have a very low occurrence of leakage in north america compared with decommissioned production wells possibly as they had not experienced the stress from pressurisation and depressurisation associated with production wells watson and bachu 2009 king and king 2013 for the purposes of this study gas exploration wells were conceptualised similarly to gas production wells because of the scores in table 1 we have prioritised the investigation of inter aquifer flow through coal exploration drillholes decommissioned exploration and production wells with a complete well integrity failure repurposed gas wells and degraded water bores for the purposes of hydrogeological modelling these can be grouped into three scenarios i leaky well flow through a micro annulus ii extremely high flow leaky well flow through ruptured or corroded steel casing and highly degraded cement and iii unrestricted flow through an open repurposed gas well or water bore 5 stage 2 system conceptualisation and analytical models in the second stage a conceptual model of the system is developed that allows the development of closed form analytical expressions to improve system understanding and a priori predict hydrogeological conditions where impact on overlying groundwater heads is likely or unlikely this step allows the parameter space for the system to be explored quickly and the identification of pathways that warrant more detailed study an important component of this stage is the establishment of appropriate metrics to determine whether impact has occurred 5 1 impact metrics the specific consequences of a poor integrity well on groundwater resources will depend on its location relative to groundwater dependent assets the hydraulic gradient between aquifers the type and extent of failure and the characteristics of the aquifer that is affected e g saline versus fresh water impact on groundwater resources is defined in this paper by the following metrics 1 a specified increase in the ratio of flow through a failed well to flow through a representative area of the regional aquitard indicating that flow through the leaking well was greater than the rate of background flow 10 increase in inter aquifer flow 2 head drawdown exceeding a specified threshold around a well which may lead to drawdown at nearby water bores and groundwater dependent ecosystems 0 5 m drawdown after 10 years at 500 m from a production well metrics might be defined differently in other situations depending on the social economic and environmental assets of a region changes to groundwater chemistry around a well that exceed a specified limit and may impact nearby water bores and groundwater dependent ecosystems is another potential metric assessment of changes to groundwater chemistry is found in the supplementary material 5 2 model conceptualisation conceptually for leaky bores or wells to have an impact on groundwater condition in water resource aquifers the following conditions need to be satisfied 1 a flow pathway exists i e the leaky gas well or water bore with a sufficiently high effective gas well water bore conductivity kw 2 a high enough hydraulic gradient between aquifer and depth interval where the connection occurs 3 the aquifer gas production zone transmissivity is high enough to sustain inter aquifer flow 4 aquitard conductivity kv is low enough that any flow through the gas well water bore is significantly greater than diffusive flow through a representative section of the aquitard 5 for aquifer contamination a significant difference in water quality exists between the overlying aquifer and production zone or deeper aquifer in addition to this for impact on groundwater condition to occur on a large scale 6 the well integrity failure density must be high enough to generate noticeable cumulative impact on inter aquifer flow based on this conceptualisation closed form analytical solutions were used to capture a broad but plausible spectrum of potential system parameters that could result in a change in flux across an aquitard separating two aquifers or an aquifer and a gas resource the analysis was used to estimate the well integrity failure density within a specified area of an aquitard that is required to produce a significant increase in the effective hydraulic conductivity of the aquitard and therefore leakage between aquifers we also investigated the limitations to flow through a leaky well whether they are constrained by the effective well conductivity or the transmissivity of the aquifers the results from the analysis were then constrained to the parameters space found in current literature 5 3 quantifying the potential impacts with analytical solutions a highly simplified three layer hydrogeological system was used to represent a well field with two aquifers separated by an aquitard fig 6 flow between the aquifers can occur through local pathways such as leaky wells or bores or by means of regionalised diffusive flow through the aquitard fig 6 the well field consists of a number of wells i a proportion of which are assumed to have failed causing leakage of fluid between aquifers the leaky wells each had a cross sectional area aw and an effective well conductivity kw fig 6a each well was assumed to be screened in the deeper aquifer gas production zone with connection to the upper aquifer due to loss of integrity through one of the pathways described above fig 6b considering the aquitard in fig 6a where aref m2 is the reference area of the aquitard considered in the flow analysis and a w i m2 is the cross sectional area of each leaky well i the density of leaky wells and keq is the equivalent hydraulic conductivity of the area aref taking into account the leaky wells ρ dimensionless is defined as 2 ρ 1 a ref i 0 n a w i where n is the number of leaky wells this diffusive flux q is composed of the sum of the flux through the leaky wells area q well and the flux q ref through the remaining area of the aquitard with reference hydraulic conductivity k ref by further assuming that the density of leaky wells ρ is very small 10 5 and by defining a significant increase in equivalent k due to the leaky wells as keq 2 kref a doubling or more of background flow between the aquifers an alternative expression for the density of leaky wells that significantly increases the equivalent conductivity of the aquitard can be derived 3 ρ k ref k w eq 3 is an expression to estimate the density of leaky wells ρ that is required to produce a significant change in flux across an aquitard flux though leaky wells which is greater than the flux though the reference area of the aquitard a full derivation is available in the supplementary material whether the flux through a single leaky well is limited by the well hydraulic conductivity can be estimated based on darcy s law using an effective well conductivity kw similarly to that described in nordbotten et al 2004 the ability of the aquifers to transmit water to or from the leaky well can be assessed using the thiem equation silliman and higgins 1990 a convolution integral was not used here as the conservative risk assessment is concerned with the maximum flow rate rather than the total rate over time when the system is in equilibrium the rates of flow into the well within the well and out of the well are equal assuming no loss to the aquitard by further assuming that the transmissivity of the gas production zone will be less than the overlying water bearing aquifer values of kw are obtained for which flow through the well is not limited by its hydraulic conductivity but rather by the transmissivity of the gas production zone aquifer 2 fig 5b 4 k w 1 9 t 2 d r w 2 where t is aquifer transmissivity d is the flow length along the leaky well and rw is the radius of the well and it is conservatively assumed that there is no further flow constraint at the point at which the well is screened within the aquifer under these conditions the low aquifer transmissivity is the limiting factor rather than vertical transmissivity through wells and as such any increase in the density of leaky wells has little effect on the overall vertical exchange of water again a full derivation is available in the supplementary material while some applications of these simple analytical models are discussed below eqs 2 and 3 were used to develop relationships between the equivalent hydraulic conductivity k eq of an aquitard incorporating a series of leaky wells and the well integrity failure density ρ effective well conductivity k w and the reference vertical aquifer conductivity kref this enabled a comparison of the parameters impacts on significant changes i e at least 10 increase in the equivalent conductivity of the aquitard keq eq 4 was used to better understand the role of aquifer transmissivity in limiting flow through wells plausible parameter ranges section 5 3 1 for well integrity failure rates kw and aquitard kv were obtained from previous studies king and king 2013 smith 2014 watson and bachu 2009 kell 2011 and used with the equations to indicate which parameter combinations were likely to result in significant impacts 5 3 1 typical parameter ranges from previous studies information on well integrity failure rates and the effective conductivity of leaky gas wells and water bores is limited and in the majority of cases estimates from onshore gas are mainly available from canadian and us shale gas and conventional gas examples kell 2011 king and king 2013 watson and bachu 2009 without specific information on australian conventional and csg wells we use these estimates for our assessments no specific information has been found for the effective conductivity of leaky water bores or coal exploration drillholes site specific transmissivity values for gas resources and aquifers aquitard thickness and vertical hydraulic conductivity and pressure head gradients across aquitards are generally more readily available transmissivity is generally within a range of 10 3 to 103 m2 d for csg formations and aquitard thickness is usually of the order of several hundred metres shanafield et al 2018 aquitard vertical hydraulic conductivity kv depends on the nature of the sedimentary material and presence of faults natural or induced fractures and other seal bypass systems such as intrusions kv generally ranges between 10 7 to 10 4 m d batlle aguilar et al 2016 turnadge et al 2016 for the case study in this paper the aquitard thickness varied from 500 to 650 m and k v varied from 10 6 to 10 3 m d smith 2014 head differences between the production targets and the pilliga sandstone were estimated from the groundwater model smith 2014 developed for the narrabri gas project eis and the bioregional assessments groundwater model for the namoi subregion sreekanth et al 2018a sreekanth et al 2018b the spatial and temporal range of head gradients between the production zone and the overlying aquifer from prior to production to immediately after production ceased but not including pressures associated with hydraulic fracturing itself was between 0 04 to 0 17 m m wu et al 2018 downward gradients were greatest immediately following the production period while upward gradients were highest prior to production lowest during and just after gas production and increased again as pressures in the production zone recovered over 100 or more years 5 3 2 well integrity failure rates as per king and king 2013 a barrier failure is defined as the failure of a single barrier to containing well pressure and fluids while well integrity failure requires all of the barriers to fail along a pathway for gas leakage between an aquifer and a gas production zone or between adjacent aquifers failure rates reported in the literature are typically based on gas migration as bore or well integrity failure is most commonly detected through surface casing vent flow scvf or gas migration gm measurements barrier and well failure rates from onshore and offshore oil conventional gas and coal seam shale gas wells were synthesised from 17 previous studies mostly from north america details of these studies and the failure rates are shown in table s4 in the supplementary material barrier failure rates ranged from 0 02 to 3 9 for onshore wells while offshore petroleum wells appeared to have higher rates of failure up to 50 after 15 years gulf of mexico it is possible that barrier failure may be defined differently for each type of well and construction standards will vary in time and between regions well integrity failure rates ranged from 0 004 to 0 06 for onshore petroleum wells in ohio and texas and between 1 3 and 9 8 for unconventional gas wells in the usa in australia no leaks have been reported in 6734 csg exploration appraisal and production wells in queensland while 0 3 of the wells have been found to have questionable cement quality during construction huddlestone holmes et al 2017 wu et al 2018 cased and abandoned wells had higher observed failure rates than drilled and abandoned open hole bores in alberta canada watson and bachu 2009 the failure rate of older legacy wells has been observed to exceed that of more modern wells bannerman et al 2005 kell 2011 two possible explanations for higher failure rates in older wells are stricter regulations for well construction and decommissioning in more recent times and the fact that in older wells more time has elapsed for corrosion and degradation of cement to take place watson and bachu 2009 however found no direct relationship between age of well and failure rate in alberta canada but rather a relationship between failure rates and well construction date relative to regulatory changes regulatory changes in australia include the queensland petroleum and gas production and safety act of 2004 queensland government 2004 and the nsw petroleum onshore act of 1991 new south wales government 1991 queensland and nsw codes of practice for well development monitoring and decommissioning accompany these acts department of natural resources mines and energy 2019 government 2012 5 3 3 effective well hydraulic conductivity cement hydraulic conductivity k c relates to the ease of passage of water through the cement matrix between the rock and the casing and between subsequent casings under normal conditions of well completion the conductivity of an intact cement matrix is usually around 0 001md to 0 1md or 10 7 to 10 5 m d appleby and wilson 1996 duguid et al 2013 wu et al 2018 however the conductivity may increase if the cemented well annulus degrades becomes damaged or forms cracks we define the effective well conductivity k w as the bulk vertical hydraulic conductivity of the well the result of water flowing through a combination of cracks and voids in the cement matrix micro annuli and fissures in the cement caused by delamination and through the cement matrix itself in other studies effective well conductivity or permeability is referred to as average permeability duguid et al 2013 bulk hydraulic characteristics crow et al 2010 effective vertical permeability gasda et al 2004 kang et al 2015 tao and bryant 2014 or vertical permeability of cement annulus carey et al 2007 we refer to hydraulic conductivity rather than permeability for the purposes of using the information in hydrogeological conceptualisations and numerical models hydraulic conductivity of unperturbed cement can be measured by analysis of core samples effective well conductivity estimation for integrity failures is less common but can be done using in situ methods such as vertical interference testing vit carey et al 2007 crow et al 2010 duguid et al 2013 or inferred from surface casing vent flow scvf information kang et al 2015 tao and bryant 2014 fig 7 shows porosity hydraulic conductivity relationships based on two data sets i small scale core samples reflecting unperturbed cement and ii large scale well data reflecting effective hydraulic conductivities and effective porosity that account for voids the core based data displays a positive linear relationship between cement conductivity and porosity the large scale effective well conductivity data unlike the core samples do not show a clear dependency on porosity especially within data sets importantly the effective well conductivities are higher than cement conductivity across the full porosity range this is best observed for the duguid et al 2013 data set where the effective well conductivity was around five orders of magnitude higher than unperturbed cement at low porosity about 30 and about two orders of magnitude higher at high porosity 60 70 for the crow et al 2010 data the effective conductivity was about three orders of magnitude higher than unperturbed cement at low porosity 10 20 and two orders of magnitude higher at high porosity 40 50 the overall lowest effective well conductivity was around 10 6 m d hawkes and gardner 2013 compared with an unperturbed cement conductivity of around 10 7 m d while the overall highest is around 10 1 m d duguid et al 2013 table s5 in the supplementary material summarises the cement properties for all data sets more recently kang et al 2015 and tao and bryant 2014 estimated the effective permeabilities of decommissioned petroleum wells based on scvf observations and detailed well construction records kang et al 2015 estimated that abandoned petroleum wells in pennsylvania had effective gas permeabilities of 10 6 to 102 md equivalent hydraulic conductivity of 10 9 to 10 1 m d assuming a temperature of around 20 c they also found that gas wells and combined oil and gas wells had higher effective conductivities than oil wells ranging between 10 1 and 102 md 10 4 to 10 1 m d tao and bryant 2014 estimated that the majority of leaky wells in british columbia have effective permeabilities of between 10 2 to 10 md 10 5 to 10 2 m d for the remainder of this paper three examples of well bore leakage were assumed with hydraulic conductivity values that span a wide and conservative range i a high flow leaky well with an effective conductivity of 10 1 m d representing the highest effective conductivity from previous studies fig 7 and similar to the kw 100md 8 1 10 2 m d as used by nordbotten et al 2009 ii an extremely high flow leaky gas well with effective conductivity of 102 m d which is around three orders of magnitude higher than the maximum effective conductivity currently estimated from previous studies fig 7 in order to test the relationships beyond the limits of conductivity that is currently found in literature and iii an open bore with an effective well conductivity of around 108 m d representing conditions where the bore is essentially an open pipe similar to the kw 6 3 108 m d from the example well problem in panday et al 2013 and supported by analysis using moody pipe friction factors for typical australian coal exploration hole parameters 5 4 analytical assessment results the significance of the closed form analytical expression eqs 2 and 3 can be best illustrated by considering an aquitard with reference zero leakage along wells hydraulic conductivity k ref between 10 6 to 10 2 m d a series of leaky wells perforate the aquifer having an effective well conductivity of either k w 102 m d fig 8 a or k w 10 1 m d fig 8b representing extremely high and high flow leaky wells respectively from these figures it can be observed that the well integrity failure density required to produce a significant 10 increase in inter aquifer flow is higher where the conductivity of the leaky well is low and the well integrity failure density required to produce a significant 10 increase in inter aquifer flow is higher when the aquitard vertical conductivity kref is high for extremely high flow leaky wells k eq deviates from k ref within the expected limits of potential well failure density ρ for aquitard conductivities of 10 3 m d fig 8a for the high flow leaky well case k eq does not deviate from the aquitard reference conductivity for k ref of 10 6 m d or greater fig 8b a higher failure rate than realistically possible is required to produce an effect on k eq in fig 8a representing an extremely high flow leaky well we denote two failed wells per square kilometre as the highest likely failure rate as this is the approximate density of wells drilled in or designed for australian coal seam gas developments a significant increase in keq 10 requires an aquitard kref of 10 3 m d this is within a plausible range for an aquitard which compares to the aquitard kh in the case study for fig 8b the high flow leaky well an aquitard kref of 10 6 m d is required for a significant increase in keq it is unlikely that an aquitard will have a hydraulic conductivity 10 6 m d to produce a significant increase in aquifer conductivity 10 through a high flow leaky well kw 10 1 m d and tight aquitard kref 10 6 m d compared with the natural flow through the aquitard the well integrity failure density needs to be 5 wells per square kilometre this requires a failure rate that is higher than the typical well installation density associated with gas developments for an extremely high flow leaky wells kw 102 m d significant aquitard conductivity is likely to occur where there is one leaky bore per square kilometre for aquitard hydraulic conductivity of 10 4 m d and less where the conditions for well integrity failure density and aquitard conductivity are realistic the well conductivity required for significant change in ke q is two orders of magnitude higher than any observed in recent studies for the ranges of well hydraulic conductivity aquitard hydraulic conductivity and well failure rates found in current literature it is extremely unlikely that leaky wells will result in significant changes to inter aquifer flow to better understand the role of aquifer hydraulic conductivity in limiting flow through leaky wells the closed form analytical expression in eq 3 was evaluated for a system based on the case study described above this allowed determination of the maximum possible flux through leaky wells bores for given aquifer conductivities which in turn helps to assess if significant changes to the aquitard conductivity are possible the system was comprised of a 114 m thick aquifer a 600 m thick aquitard and a 21 m thick csg production interval a head difference of 115 m between the aquifer and production interval was assumed smith 2014 for effective well conductivities less than 103 m d flow through the well q was logarithmically proportional to kw fig 9 a where kw was greater than 104 m d flow through the well q remained constant and limited by the conductivity of the gas production zone aquifer k h a high flow leaky well and extremely high flow leaky well were limited by effective well conductivity while an open bore was limited by the aquifer transmissivity fig 9b shows that for the model parameters used flow q through an open bore becomes limited as soon as the aquifer conductivity kh 103 m d from that moment onwards the maximum flow in an open bore has been reached the maximum flux q through the extremely high flow leaky well is determined by an aquifer conductivity kh 10 2 m d the maximum flux through the high flow leaky well is independent of aquifer conductivity for the full range of k h values considered 6 stage 3 site specific modelling of inter aquifer leakage the analytical analysis of passive water flow through a leaky decommissioned production well and water bore was followed by more detailed assessments using numerical groundwater flow models for single local scale and multiple wells sub regional scale based on simplified yet realistic parameters in the case study described in section 2 the technical expertise and computational resources required makes multi phase flow modelling impractical to estimate the impact on groundwater head from every proposed new gas well gas field or water bore that may have integrity issues this is especially the case for the screening of potential risks from hundreds if not thousands of potential gas wells or water bores at the regional level a high throughput conservative screening methodology is needed for wells bores that were identified by the screening method to be of potentially high risk a subsequent step could include use of more sophisticated simulators including multi phase models for the screening method single phase analytical assessment and groundwater models such as modflow harbaugh and mcdonald 1996 can provide more realistic and site specific insights into potential risks moore et al 2014 demonstrated that modflow over estimated the magnitude and rate of drawdown in coal seams due to extraction of water compared with the multi phase flow model eclipse indicating that single phase models provide a conservative estimate of drawdown the single phase approach used in this study neglects the presences of gas which can impede the movement of water within the rock matrix thereby slowing drawdown a simplified numerical model of flow through a single leaky well and a larger numerical model of whole proposed csg development were developed to assess i the relative contribution of a single leaky well or bore to inter aquifer groundwater flow compared with diffuse flow through the aquitard ii the maximum drawdown and iii the recovery time of the aquifer toward pre production pressure 6 1 numerical modelling of flow through a single well a groundwater flow model of a single vertical leaky gas well or water bore was developed to represent the simplified hydrogeological system composed of three layers aquifer pilliga sandstone layer 1 aquitard layer 2 and gas resource coal seams within the maules creek formation layer 3 modflow usg panday et al 2013 was used to develop the numerical model with an algomesh voronoi unstructured grid used to represent the hydrostratigraphy merrick 2015 the continuous linear network cln package enabled flow along conduits much smaller than the cell dimensions to be represented without requiring additional mesh discretisation panday et al 2013 the cln simulated flow through a conduit governed by a head gradient and resistance to flow through the conduit kw between the conduit and the aquifer matrix skin factor and through the connected aquifers kaq the circular model domain was defined with a 10 km radius around a single leaky well or bore defined such as to represent one of the three flow conditions an open bore k w 108 m d an extremely high flow leaky gas well or water bore k w 102 m d and a high flow leaky gas well or water bore k w 10 1 m d the voronoi mesh was defined with a maximum cell dimension of 750 m changing exponentially to a minimum cell size of 0 5 m adjacent to the well doble et al 2018 model parameters were based on that of a model of the proposed narrabri coals seam gas development smith 2014 are shown in the supplementary material table s6 and are described in more detail in doble et al 2018 the well radius was assumed to be 0 25 m which is conservatively larger than coal seam gas wells in australia flow through the leaky well was compared with the flow through a one square kilometre area of aquitard based on a density of one csg well per km2 for the case study area smith 2014 6 2 single well modelling results modelling of the leaky bore using modflow usg with a 115 m head difference 0 17 m m downward hydraulic gradient between the production zone and overlying aquifer indicated that there was very little change in inter aquifer flow compared with a fully sealed control for the leaky well 1 increase but a large change in inter aquifer flow for the open bore 37 times larger table s7 supplementary material increasing the aquifer kh tenfold did not significantly change the flow through the leaky well although it increased the flow through the open bore by an order of magnitude this again suggests that under these hydraulic conditions unrestricted flow through the open bore is limited by aquifer conductivity while flow through the leaky well is limited by well hydraulic conductivity drawdown in the overlying aquifer layer 1 was not within a detectable range for the high flow leaky well but estimated to be around 5 m near the open bore fig 10 a and 0 5 m at 1 km from the well after 10 years fig 10b due to the conservative well radius used in the modelling the drawdown is likely to be less than indicated in fig 10 6 3 modelling of multiple well integrity failures in a more detailed study of the case study a three dimensional five layer groundwater flow model of the whole region was developed using modflow usg the model was used to calculate groundwater drawdown for different rates of spatially randomised well integrity failure densities for the leaky well and open bore scenarios noorduijn et al 2017 depressurisation conditions typical of those during and after gas production section 5 3 1 were placed on the two modelled target csg formations maules creek and hoskissons formation and failure of wells was considered to occur only after gas production had ceased simulations of leaky wells included failure rates of between 0 no pathways and 100 all wells provide pathways of all 425 potential well pad sites as indicated in smith 2016 pathways were modelled using the continuous linear network cln package the possibility of clustered well integrity failures was incorporated by using a spatially correlated random failure approach with correlation distances of 2 km and 10 km noorduijn et al 2017 the same model was used to model potential inter aquifer leakage through open bores penetrating through the aquifer and target coal seam low failure density rates of 1 2 and 5 using the locations of the potential csg well sites were used to simulate the likely spatial distribution of water bores or fully open coal exploration drillholes a more detailed description of this modelling can be found in noorduijn et al 2017 the total vertical downward flow rate across the gas project area through the leaky wells towards the depressurised gas resource for the borefield was estimated to be 0 37 m3 d for the high flow leaky wells with a 100 failure density and 1500 m3 d for the open bores with a 5 failure density this is compared with a diffuse flow rate across the aquitard within the gas project area of 200 m3 day there was no difference in groundwater drawdown for the multiple well integrity failure modelling for well integrity failure rates between 0 and 100 of wells fig 12 a meaning that flow through the leaky wells was not high enough to cause a significant impact on groundwater heads in the overlying aquifer for flow through open bores the failure density did have a significant effect on drawdown fig 12b in this case the maximum drawdown close to an open well for the proposed development area was estimated to be approximately 3 m greater when 5 of wells provided a pathway between the production zones and the overlying aquifer compared with a zero open bore scenario a full set of results is presented in noorduijn et al 2017 7 discussion pathways for inter aquifer flow were assessed using a three stage process consisting of qualitative analysis closed form analytical equations and numerical modelling of single well and multiple well integrity failure scenarios the potential impact metrics that were assessed in this study were an increase in flow through a failed well compared with baseline flow through a representative area of regional aquitard resulting in head drawdown around a well this could affect adjacent water bores and groundwater dependent ecosystems from the analytical analysis it was indicated that high flow leaky wells kw 10 1 m d require a failure density of more than five wells per square kilometre and a tight aquitard kref 10 6 m d to have a significant impact on inter aquifer leakage while an aquitard with kref 10 6 m d is plausible in gas development regions a well density of more than two wells per square kilometre is unlikely which means a failure rate of 5 wells per square kilometre is highly unlikely for extremely high flow leaky wells kw 102 m d to have a significant effect on inter aquifer leakage required a failure density of one well per km2 and an aquitard kref 10 4 m d both of which are possible alternatively failure density kref couples of one well per 10 km2 and kref 10 5 m d or one well per 100 km2 and kref 10 6 m d are also likely to have observable effects on inter aquifer leakage to date kw values of 1 m d have not been reported in any studies it is unlikely that leaky gas wells would have a significant impact on groundwater heads but coal exploration drillholes or water bores with similar high flow leakage have the potential to enhance inter aquifer flow open wells representing legacy coal exploration drillholes and water bores in this analysis would result in high rates of inter aquifer leakage if they are drilled to a depth to intersect the csg production zone and left open however flow will be limited by aquifer or production zone transmissivity where kw is high and it is likely that flow within open wells would eventually be reduced by minor obstructions such as movement in the rock matrix in the numerical analysis of single wells drawdown in the overlying aquifer was not observed for a high flow leaky well with model parameterisation based on the case study of the proposed narrabri csg development area described in section 2 flow through an open well or bore that was assumed to have been drilled to the depth of a csg interval and left open resulted in a drawdown of 5 m near the well and 0 5 m at a distance of 1 km from the well after 10 years this amount of drawdown may have a significant consequence depending on the location and socioeconomic value of local groundwater dependent ecosystems or water bores for a multi well numerical model using model parameters based on those for the case study described in section 2 flow through a high flow leaky well kw 0 1 m d did not have a significant impact on groundwater drawdown for any well integrity failure density from 0 all wells intact to 100 all wells leaking the presence of hypothetical open exploration or water bores that are assumed to have been drilled to the csg interval and kept open however increased groundwater drawdown immediately after cessation of production by around 3 m with an open well density of one well per 46 km2 compared with an intact aquitard augmented inter aquifer flow through the opens bores was predicted to have a more local effect on groundwater levels rather than a widespread regional impact the case study of the proposed narrabri csg development area only provided one suite of parameters to be used in the single well and multi well modelling which may limit the applicability of the findings on other sites however the agreement between the site specific modelling and the analytical analysis which had a parameter range that spanned the distribution of parameters found in the global literature suggests that it did provide a realistic example which may be used to draw conclusions about likelihood of impacts on groundwater head all three assessment methods concurred that the flow through leaky wells via pathways through degraded cement or micro annuli was very small to negligible for conditions reported in previous studies and for the case study example extremely high flow leaky wells kw 102 m d such as wells with shear or tensile failure or legacy coal exploration drillholes and water bores may have a larger effect on groundwater drawdown and should be investigated further with a focus on estimating the range of possible kw and observed failure rates the effective well conductivities that define extremely high flow leaky wells are yet to be observed by field measurements in australia an audit of current and historical gas wells in australia is necessary to conclusively eliminate extremely high flow leaky wells as potential accelerators of inter aquifer flow there is a need to assess any existing data on coal exploration drillholes and degraded water bores to identify instances in which they intersect caprock or aquitards and form a pathway for inter aquifer flow better definition of plausible kw ranges and failure rates in drillholes and bores particularly in australian conditions is also required and more data on aquitard conductivity kref head gradients between aquifers and target coal seams and aquitard thicknesses are required for site specific investigations legacy open coal exploration drillholes and gas wells repurposed into water bores are a pathway prioritised for further analysis high rates of leakage are possible through old gas wells water bores or gas wells that have historically been repurposed into water bores detailed analysis of the likely impacts on groundwater including changes in water quality potential for surface spills to contaminate deeper aquifers and although out of scope for this paper gas leakage and migration should be undertaken before repurposing occurs legacy open coal exploration drillholes also have the potential for high rates of leakage with the clause that there is relatively little data for kw and it is possible that kw will reduce in time due to geological plasticity at large depths coal exploration drillholes are usually shallow as they target coal at mineable depths compared to csg wells therefore they are less likely to penetrate through any aquitards between gas production formations and shallow aquifers gas exploration wells are required to be cased to the same standard as production wells and correctly sealed when decommissioned for example government 2012 therefore their potential impacts on groundwater drawdown are more likely to be of the same type and magnitude as decommissioned production wells the different approaches of the three stage screening process of risk prioritisation analytical assessment single and multiple numerical analyses were assessed according to their relevant scope certainty limits and appropriateness table 4 the results from each of the approaches were then compared for each of the inter aquifer pathways table 5 open coal exploration drillholes and water bores were assessed to have a higher impact on groundwater head from single well modelling before the relative density of exploration bores or repurposed wells had been accounted for for failure densities of up to one well per 46 km2 the potential impact on groundwater head was expected to be moderate the anticipated impact of high flow leaky wells on groundwater head from the risk prioritisation assessment was higher than that estimated from the analytical and numerical modelling the potential impact was overestimated possibly because it was difficult to assess the severity of impact without numerically calculating flow rates through wells and related drawdown from the multiple well numerical modelling the total predicted flow through an open well scenario eg legacy boreholes at a well density of one well per 46 km2 was around four orders of magnitude higher than the high flow leaky well example at 100 failure with this hindsight the severity score given to compromised decommissioned wells should have been between 3 and 4 no impact to minimal impact the risk prioritisation relied on assumptions many of which were based on pre conceived ideas of likely impact although the estimated magnitude of impact varied the ranking of the pathway impacts was in the same order as the other modelling based results which supports the use of this approach for rapid assessment the main benefit of using multiple lines of evidence across the three stages to assess the potential impacts of different inter aquifer pathways is that each approach works at a different scale and scope the broad qualitative risk prioritisation captured both the physical components of the pathways as well as less quantifiable aspects such as codes of practice for construction and management which requires further detailed analysis behavioural and economic influences and constraints with reasonable background information and assumptions it can be used to extrapolate to estimate potential risks in locations and for pathways that have not yet been predicted numerically analytical assessment with highly simplified conceptualisation does not precisely capture the behaviour of a specific location but can be used to quickly and inexpensively assess pathways across the full range of potential parameterisation guidelines can be developed to prioritise pathways or developments for further investigation numerical modelling has an increasingly higher resource cost as the complexity of the models increase the modelling can capture the nuances associated with localised geology and hydrology but may over or under estimate the effect if the model conceptualisation or parameterisation varies too far from reality probabilistic modelling provides a range of potential impacts with estimates of likelihood of impact this study assumed that water movement through leaky gas wells can be modelled conservatively using a single phase groundwater flow model it did not attempt to analyse the impacts of pressure changes due to any hydraulic fracturing which is not proposed for the case study or gas production but passive flow through leaky wells or open bores driven by post production head gradients well integrity failure rates and effective well conductivity in australian conditions were assumed to be adequately defined by available data from north american studies to increase the confidence in the assessment of potential impacts to groundwater levels from inter aquifer leakage through compromised wells in australia a thorough review of well integrity failure rates associated with different types of development and ages of wells and bores is required preferably it should differentiate between failure of water bores csg wells oil and conventional gas wells and coal exploration drillholes due to differences in drilling depths separation distances between aquifers and production zones and aquifer and aquitard characteristics it should also include a review of cement and steel durability and degradation rates under australian conditions a review of the effective well conductivity kw of existing wells in australia is required also differentiating by well or bore types and ages longitudinal studies of the changes in kw in time increasing kw from ongoing degradation or decreasing kw from deep geological plasticity would be a significant contribution to risk analysis studies for resource development finally consistent definitions of hydrogeological well integrity failure rather than single barrier breach and the subsequent environmental impacts of the hydrogeological failures would increase the ability to compare incidences and effects across multiple resource oil gas and water production classes 8 conclusions a three stage multi scale screening approach was used for rapid assessment of the potential impacts to groundwater heads from accelerated inter aquifer leakage through gas wells legacy coal exploration drillholes and water bores semi quantitative risk prioritisation provided an indication of potential impact accounting for both severity and likelihood of occurrence and the time until detection analytical analysis was used to indicate under which conditions a pathway is likely to accelerate inter aquifer flow for the full spectrum of possible parameters and prioritise pathways for further assessment numerical analysis of the effects of single and multiple wells on aquifer drawdown for a case study near narrabri australia added a head gradient component to the assessment and supported the results from the analytical analysis from the assessments it is unlikely that high flow leaky wells effective well conductivity kw 10 1 m d based on the highest values found in literature will have an impact on groundwater resources in australia based on conditions described in current studies although extremely high well conductivities kw 102 m d were tested for numerical completeness their potential impact is restricted to limited conditions of high failure density and low aquitard conductivity and these higher rates of kw have not been demonstrated in field measurements to date international studies suggest a maximum kw of 1 m d fig 7 although there is no information on effective well conductivity for australian conditions leakage through legacy coal exploration drillholes and degraded water bores is less likely due to the spatial and vertical separation from deeper gas resources but cannot be ruled out until further information is provided on failure rates and plausible ranges of kw exploration drillholes may have kw decreasing with time due to geological plasticity acting to partially or fully reseal the drillhole the transmissivity of aquifers and target coal seams is likely to limit inter aquifer flow through drillholes and bores where kw is high the multiple well integrity failure model developed for the case study suggested that even if 100 of the proposed wells were compromised enough to create leakage pathways the effects on groundwater drawdown in the upper aquifer would be negligible leakage through open bores at a density of one well per 46 km2 was predicted to cause a maximum drawdown within the development area of around 2 m this multi stage screening process provided a useful approach for prioritising inter aquifer flow pathways and assessing where further more complex and costly quantification of impact and risk analysis was required each of the methods had different scopes certainty limitations and appropriateness for application the risk prioritisation and analytical modelling had wider scopes and covered a broader parameter space but had lower certainty and more limitations due to the assumptions and simplifications associated with these methods the numerical modelling methods better captured the local site conditions but were more time and resource consuming and had the potential to over or under estimate impact if the model conceptualisation was not correct credit authorship contribution statement

2249,integrity failure of wells in gas resource developments poses a potential risk to groundwater resource quality and quantity by enhancing the connectivity and fluid migration between a gas reservoir and overlying aquifers which may support groundwater dependent ecosystems or be used as a water source this study assessed the potential for impact on groundwater resources from flow pathways created by well integrity failure in decommissioned coal seam gas csg wells deep water bores or gas wells repurposed as water bores and legacy coal exploration drillholes using an example based on a proposed csg development near narrabri australia the study only considered the flow of water a multi stage screening method for likelihood and consequence assessment was used which included i a semi quantitative risk prioritisation of potential pathways for inter aquifer leakage and development of metrics for impact assessment ii assessment of the consequences of each of these pathways through an analytical model and iii numerical groundwater modelling of single and multiple leaky wells all three approaches indicated that increases in inter aquifer leakage drawdown in upper aquifers are not likely to be significant for high flow leaky gas wells effective well conductivity kw 10 1 m d based on conditions reported in previous studies and for the case study it is theoretically possible that extremely high flow leaky wells kw 102 m d could have an impact where aquitard conductivity is 10 4 m d or less or well failure density is higher than 1 well per km2 however kw values for compromised gas wells of 1 m d have not been identified in previous studies the most extreme case tested open legacy coal exploration drillholes or petroleum bores repurposed into water bores across an aquitard should it occur has the potential to deplete or contaminate groundwater resources in connected aquifers the magnitude of which will depend on aquifer and production zone transmissivity however current australian regulations for petroleum exploration make this an extremely unlikely case more effort is required to determine kw and failure rates of gas wells water bores and exploration drillholes in australian conditions to better quantify the potential risks associated with leaking infrastructure keywords well integrity well failure coal seam gas impact assessment effective well conductivity groundwater resources data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the impact of natural gas resource development on groundwater resources is an area of concern in australia and worldwide cui et al 2018 sreekanth et al 2020 vengosh et al 2014 vidic et al 2013 in australia gas developments consist of conventional gas where gas is held in reservoirs within a porous rock matrix typically overlain by a low permeability caprock and coal seam gas csg also known as coal bed methane in us and canada hamawand et al 2013 towler et al 2016 where gas is held within coal seams that occur between 300 m and 1000 m below the ground surface mallants et al 2018 shale gas or tight gas resources in sedimentary shales and very low permeability sandstones and limestones respectively occurring between 1500 m and 4000 m below the ground surface are currently being explored with some early production trials geoscience australia 2015 geoscience australia 2021 production of conventional gas involves drilling to a gas reservoir and extracting gas and water through cement and steel lined wells generally through the buoyancy effects of the gas production of shale gas or tight gas generally requires hydraulic fracture stimulation to produce gas at economic rates and quantities production of coal seam gas which is trapped within coal seams requires water levels in the coal seams to be reduced to allow the gas to desorb from the coal csg development may also involve an initial hydraulic fracture stimulation of the coal seams to enhance permeability for gas flow although to date only 6 of wells in productive australian csg fields in the bowen and surat basins in queensland have required stimulation mallants et al 2018a after gas production ceases gas wells are required to be sealed and capped with cement and the pore fluid pressures in the coal seams gradually recover to pre production levels over the course of up to several hundreds of years cook et al 2016 there is a potential hazard from leaky wells on groundwater and groundwater dependent ecosystems because gas wells perforate the caprock that separates the coal or gas resource from overlying aquifers that may support groundwater dependent ecosystems or be used for water sources well integrity failure through failures of all well barriers at a location has the potential to accelerate inter aquifer leakage by providing direct pathways through leaky wells jackson 2014 in some instances decommissioned gas wells have been repurposed into water bores which pose similar potential hazards to groundwater resources from inter aquifer leakage dnrm 2013 however the likelihood and magnitude of impacts on groundwater from accelerated inter aquifer leakage through wells is unclear potential impacts on aquifers include changes to groundwater quantity and quality inter aquifer leakage may result in drawdown of surficial aquifers where the flux as a result of gas resource depressurisation is downward doble et al 2016 potential contamination of aquifers through groundwater influx from more saline aquifers or from hydrocarbons or residual drilling fluid around the production zone may also occur mallants et al 2018a this paper assesses potential changes in aquifer heads resulting from various scenarios of leaky wells connecting aquifers and deeper developed coal seams a complementary assessment of the potential impacts on the salinity of overlying aquifers due to upwards leakage from more saline deeper aquifers is provided in the supplementary material risks to water resources from gas developments either through dewatering or contamination have been studied using semi quantitative analyses analytical analyses and numerical modelling but very few studies have specifically looked at water leakage through degraded or compromised wells there have been some research efforts in the conceptually similar co2 sequestration space which have been included in reviews of literature for this paper the main point of difference is that environmental impacts from co2 sequestering wells are usually defined as the movement of gas rather than liquid between aquifers or to the surface semi quantitative reviews of the risks of gas and oil developments in australia have most recently been represented by mallants et al 2018a and shanafield et al 2018 and in the bioregional assessments 1 1 https www bioregionalassessments gov au bioregional assessment program and geological and bioregional assessments 2 2 https www bioregionalassessments gov au gba programs the mallants et al 2018a analysis focused on csg production while the shanafield et al 2018 analysis included three types of unconventional gas sources coal seam shale and tight gas mallants et al 2018a reviewed plausible chemical migration pathways in australian csg developments for all plausible risks including surface handling of hydraulic fracturing fluid drilling and construction of wells faults and fractures and leaky wells the review found that pathways with highest relative risks relating to an absolute risk of around 1 or less included surface handling of fracturing fluids and poor integrity of gas and oil wells old water bores and coal exploration bores but that there was limited information for well integrity failure rates and effective well conductivity in australian conditions the potential contamination pathways included in the shanafield et al 2018 review were surface spills inter aquifer leakage through the aquitard during hydraulic fracturing inter aquifer leakage through the aquitard after production ceases and depletion of shallow aquifers from production water requirements leakage through compromised and corroded wells was only assessed during hydraulic fracturing shanafield et al 2018 concluded that the pathway with the highest risk was surface handling of chemicals analytical analyses have been used to predict inter aquifer flow from gas development across a broad but plausible parameter space cook et al 2016 developed analytical solutions to estimate induced flow through the aquitards that separate aquifers and gas production zones due to increases or decreases in pressure during gas production this analysis did not include flow through wells and other local pathways nordbotten et al 2004 developed analytical solutions for passive leakage of an aqueous liquid through wells for geological sequestration of co2 they calculated passive leakage using an expression based on darcy s law and use a convolution integral to account for well flow varying with time and temporally varying heads due to changes in flow rates through the injection wells numerical modelling has been used for more detailed evaluation of well leakage rates in the oil and petroleum research sector modelling of leakage through wells has most commonly been undertaken using multi phase flow models such as eclipse schlumberger 2011 dumux flemisch et al 2011 or tough realgash2o simulator moridis and freeman 2014 similar well integrity studies have been reported from gas migration simulations related to geological co2 sequestration lewicki et al 2007 nordbotten et al 2009 some studies used multi phase flow models to estimate the potential effects of gas wells on overlying aquifers kissinger et al 2013 nowamooz et al 2015 reagan et al 2015 these studies however were primarily focused on gas migration rather than inter aquifer leakage of water in moving from semi quantitative analyses to analytical assessment and full numerical assessment there is an increase in quantitative certainty about the potential impacts of gas wells on groundwater condition through various hydraulic or contaminant transport pathways but also an increase in computational effort rather than modelling all combinations of development scenarios and pathways screening approaches allow those pathways that are highly unlikely to affect groundwater condition to be excluded from numerical testing significantly reducing the number of numerical assessments required in this paper we aim to systematically assess the potential effects of inter aquifer flow on groundwater head through a series of potential pathways associated with leaky wells we use a multi stage screening method combining three different lines of evidence to assess the potential impacts on groundwater heads from inter aquifer leakage through compromised gas wells and water bores we first present the three methods that comprise the staged impact assessment a semi quantitative risk prioritisation of potential pathways followed by a quantitative assessment using an analytical model and finally a numerical modelling based assessment with single well and multiple well conceptualisations we apply the methodology to a case study area in a csg basin in australia the modelling approaches use single phase analytical and numerical groundwater models as a conservative approach to modelling the effects of enhanced depressurisation from inter aquifer leakage on groundwater resources the assessment is limited to the impacts of groundwater leakage on groundwater head in the post production phase where the production zone is recovering from depressurisation and the likelihood of severe well degradation is higher we do not assess the potential impacts from short term stimulation induced high pressures on fluid flow through a compromised well annulus rather our study is concerned with the changes in groundwater heads in overlying aquifers used for water resources purposes as a result of long term well degradation fig 1 2 case study site description the proposed csg development area used as an example in the assessment is approximately 957 km2 in size and located near narrabri in the namoi subregion of new south wales australia smith 2016 it consists of 850 proposed production wells on a maximum of 425 well pads with up to 3 wellheads per pad which primarily target the coal seams within the maules creek formation at depths between 500 and 1000 m below surface smith 2014 smith 2016 the maules creek formation has an average total thickness of 125 m in the proposed development area with individual coal seams up to 20 m thick fig 2 it is overlain by a thick sequence of middle permian to jurassic sedimentary rocks which collectively represent an aquitard unit this incorporates the hoskissons coal formation which is the secondary target for csg development this is overlain by a key confined aquifer the pilliga sandstone a key water source for the area the pilliga sandstone is around 114 m thick in the area of investigation doble et al 2018 a multi layer aquitard up to 600 m thick separates the maules creek csg formation from the overlying aquifer the pilliga sandstone crops out to the east of the investigation area and is overlain by the blythesdale group keelindi beds rolling downs group and superficial sediments the pilliga sandstone is part of the great artesian basin gab the largest and deepest artesian basin in the world covering an area of around 1 7 million square kilometres the proposed csg development is on the eastern margin of the gab the other industries that interact with groundwater in the area are coal mining and agriculture in 2016 there were 4 682 registered water bores within 30 km of the proposed site smith 2016 mostly extracting from the piliga sandstone and overlying alluvium approximately 470 coal exploration core holes have been drilled within 30 km of the study area nsw minview stolz 2021 of these 20 are deeper than 300 m and the majority of historical bores did not penetrate multiple aquifers smith 2016 there are 2 petroleum wells that are now registered as a water bore 3 three stage assessment method the three stage assessment method described in this paper consists of 1 qualitative assessment identifying pathways for well integrity failure to impact groundwater resources qualitatively assessing the relevant pathways and assigning a risk priority score 2 system conceptualisation and analytical models establishing appropriate metrics to determine whether impact has occurred and application of closed form analytical expressions to improve system understanding and a priori predict hydrogeological conditions where impact is likely or unlikely 3 numerical models identifying plausible model parameters ranges such as effective well conductivity kw well densities and well integrity failure rates based on previous studies followed by numerical modelling of groundwater head changes or contamination due to well integrity failure for single and multiple wells to confirm outcomes from the analytical assessment the final step also includes reporting pathways that may require more detailed modelling one of the aims of this study is to assess the performance of the screening process each of the pathways identified were assessed at each of the three screening levels even those that would have been flagged as not a priority for more detailed modelling this approach allowed the performance of the screening process to be assessed 4 stage 1 qualitative assessment the first stage in the three stage assessment method is identification of the pathways that may lead to an impact on groundwater head and a qualitative risk assessment of these pathways the aim of this step if to ensure that all plausible pathways have been identified the qualitative assessment allows the pathways to be prioritised for further investigation in subsequent stages 4 1 identifying fluid migration pathways failed or leaky production wells or decommissioned wells within gas development regions have the potential to lead to pathways for inter aquifer leakage the potential for wells with integrity issues will inevitably increase despite improvements in regulatory and operational practices given the exponential growth of unconventional gas production worldwide wells with poor integrity may lead to potential risks of stressing groundwater resources e g depressurisation linked to csg production and groundwater contamination from leakage of saline groundwater into less saline aquifers davies et al 2014 use the terminology of well barrier failure and well integrity failure to describe the failure of a single well barrier along a flow pathway and failure of enough well barriers to create a pathway for inter aquifer flow other reporting standards in the petroleum industry refer to well integrity breaches and hydrogeological breaches to describe the same processes wu et al 2018 often multiple well barrier failures such as both cement and steel casing are required to cause a well integrity failure our assumption is that each pathway described in figs 3 5 results in a well integrity failure where all barriers in a potential leakage pathway fail in a way that a pathway is created king and king 2013 the pathway is defined by the limiting factor smallest effective well conductivity along the pathway for inter aquifer flow assuming that there is a sufficient hydraulic gradient present for flow to occur well age is another factor which appears to influence the likelihood of a well integrity failure the csg resource sector in australia is still relatively young having commenced in 1995 therefore existing csg wells are more likely to have been developed and decommissioned according to higher modern standards and regulatory requirements with changes to state petroleum acts in the 1990s and early 2000s see section 5 3 2 conventional gas has been extracted in australia since the early 1960s and therefore may include much older legacy wells that were either constructed or decommissioned to a lower standard than is required today or have had more time for degradation of steel and cement to take place bannerman et al 2005 kell 2011 these are discussed more fully below additional pathways that could enhance inter aquifer leakage include deep water bores deep uncased coal exploration drillholes co2 sequestration wells faults and fractures water bores with poor integrity include deep water bores 200 m in depth that have multiple screens across different formations some of which occur in coal seam formations mallants et al 2018a some of these water bores are petroleum wells that have been converted to water bores dnrm 2013 and this is still permitted under certain guidelines in queensland business queensland queensland government 2020 although well conversions may not be permitted in other jurisdictions water bores that remain in service well beyond their design lifetime may experience loss of integrity of the casing and potentially result in interconnection of aquifers leading to mixing of different water qualities as an example an analysis of leaky water bores in the angas bremer catchment in south australia indicated that 50 of water bores were not leaking 40 of water bores were leaking at 0 14 m3 day and 10 of water bores were leaking at 2 2 m3 day zulfic and barnett 2007 further pathways that might enhance inter aquifer leakage are those linked to deep uncased exploration drillholes e g for coal mining up to 500 m deep and deep injection wells for co2 geo sequestration around 2000 m deep gaurina međimurec and pašić 2011 the risk associated with uncased exploration drillholes was discussed by mallants et al 2018 and found to be of very low risk based on coal resource data from the eastern australia it is unlikely that coal exploration drillholes will interact with csg developments through hydraulic fracturing due to the spatial and depth separation of coal deposits targeted for mining which are usually 300 m deep and coal seams targeted by csg extraction which are typically deeper than 1000 m risk assessments for deep co2 injection wells can be found in leung et al 2014 and zhang and bachu 2011 to date very few co2 sequestration wells have been developed in australia pathways for gas and water movement through fractures and faults has been investigated in detail in turnadge et al 2018 mccallum et al 2018 underschultz et al 2018 and reviewed in mallants et al 2018b and davies et al 2012 these pathways are not included in this assessment the pathways that were assessed for the case study in this paper are shown in table 1 and included coal exploration drillholes inadequately decommissioned orphan wells wells that no longer have any organisation legally responsible to deal with abandonment responsibilities water bores and decommissioned csg wells that have compromised integrity due to degraded cement and steel or development of flow paths through micro annuli or incomplete cementing these pathways are shown in figs 3 5 wu et al 2018 and are grouped into three general types 1 gas flow through pathways in decommissioned gas production or co2 injection wells wells with a steel casing and cement annulus of which sections are plugged with cement and the wellhead cut off and sealed below the surface on decommissioning pathways include flow through micro annuli as a result of debonding at the cement casing interface or at the cement rock matrix interface through corroded steel casing or incomplete well cementation or through degraded poor well construction or incomplete cement plugs poor well design these would also require a driving force for fluid movement from an over or under pressured aquifer reservoir fig 3 2 wb inter aquifer leakage through i gas wells that have historically been repurposed for water extraction repurposing is not possible under current regulations and policies in new south wales but permitted in queensland business queensland queensland government 2020 and ii deep water bores 200 m with corroded steel casing fig 4 historical conversion may allow aquifer mixing but minimum construction requirements for water bores in australia mcr requires that aquifers should not be able to mix 3 coal flow through coal exploration drillholes which are uncased and depending on their age on decommissioning may be backfilled with the drilled rock material and or capped with a cement plug at the top and have a series of further cement plugs to separate flow between aquifers fig 5 4 2 qualitative risk assessment of pathways a qualitative assessment of the potential risk associated with each pathway was performed using a logarithmic risk analysis framework similar to that used in the australian government bioregional assessments ba program ford et al 2016 this framework was based on the failure modes and effects analysis fmea method for identifying hazards in complex systems with multiple components qualitative risk assessment relies on assumptions of likelihood and consequence many of which are based on pre conceived understanding of a system despite best available information being used where possible this method can be useful for a rapid assessment to screen highly unlikely impact pathways if assumptions are conservative potentially higher impact pathways can be more rigorously tested using multiple lines of evidence the suitability of using a qualitative assessment method for assessing risks from failed bore integrity on groundwater levels was reviewed in section 7 inter aquifer flow pathways that were identified from a review of literature were collated and scored by the authors according to the severity of their potential impacts the likelihood of the pathway occurring and the likelihood of being detected table 1 a risk priority number was calculated from the sum of the severity likelihood and detection scores 1 risk p r i o r i t y n u m b e r s e v e r i t y l i k e l i h o o d d e t e c t i o n the severity score is based on a one unit increase e g from minor to moderate resulting in a tenfold increase in environmental impact the scoring system for likelihood is based on the log of the annual occurrence rate the detection score is based on the log of the time to detection in days the severity likelihood and detection scoring tables are shown in the supplementary material tables s1 s3 in the qualitative risk assessment the assigned severity score was based on whether inter aquifer leakage could be potentially high due to high well conductivity in the case of unlined exploration wells or water bores repurposed from gas wells or a low due to potentially low well conductivity in the case of loss of well integrity due to well corrosion or a delamination within the micro annulus wang and taleghani 2012 likelihood for the pathway to occur was ranked higher in historical repurposed gas wells and legacy exploration wells and lower for deteriorated decommissioned production wells a severe well integrity failure through shear or tensile failure to the casing is more likely to occur during production due to geomechanical processes associated with depressurisation of the formation as wells are routinely monitored during production such a failure is likely to be quickly detected and repaired before decommissioning occurs and is less likely to generate inter aquifer flow in the post production period it was therefore scored low for likelihood re sealing of exploration drillholes is likely at depth where they encounter weaker geological formations mudstones and claystones are present mallants et al 2018a this reduces both the potential severity and likelihood of impact for unsealed drillholes repurposed gas wells were given a low detection score as any contamination of the groundwater should be quickly detected as it is used exploration wells and degraded wells were given medium to high scores as they are likely to take longer to be detected especially for decommissioned wells that are not normally monitored aggregating these scores suggested that legacy coal exploration drillholes had the highest risk priority for investigation with gas wells repurposed into water bores and degraded water bores being the next highest risk to groundwater resources table 1 abandoned exploration gas wells that had been constructed to modern regulatory requirements were found to have a very low occurrence of leakage in north america compared with decommissioned production wells possibly as they had not experienced the stress from pressurisation and depressurisation associated with production wells watson and bachu 2009 king and king 2013 for the purposes of this study gas exploration wells were conceptualised similarly to gas production wells because of the scores in table 1 we have prioritised the investigation of inter aquifer flow through coal exploration drillholes decommissioned exploration and production wells with a complete well integrity failure repurposed gas wells and degraded water bores for the purposes of hydrogeological modelling these can be grouped into three scenarios i leaky well flow through a micro annulus ii extremely high flow leaky well flow through ruptured or corroded steel casing and highly degraded cement and iii unrestricted flow through an open repurposed gas well or water bore 5 stage 2 system conceptualisation and analytical models in the second stage a conceptual model of the system is developed that allows the development of closed form analytical expressions to improve system understanding and a priori predict hydrogeological conditions where impact on overlying groundwater heads is likely or unlikely this step allows the parameter space for the system to be explored quickly and the identification of pathways that warrant more detailed study an important component of this stage is the establishment of appropriate metrics to determine whether impact has occurred 5 1 impact metrics the specific consequences of a poor integrity well on groundwater resources will depend on its location relative to groundwater dependent assets the hydraulic gradient between aquifers the type and extent of failure and the characteristics of the aquifer that is affected e g saline versus fresh water impact on groundwater resources is defined in this paper by the following metrics 1 a specified increase in the ratio of flow through a failed well to flow through a representative area of the regional aquitard indicating that flow through the leaking well was greater than the rate of background flow 10 increase in inter aquifer flow 2 head drawdown exceeding a specified threshold around a well which may lead to drawdown at nearby water bores and groundwater dependent ecosystems 0 5 m drawdown after 10 years at 500 m from a production well metrics might be defined differently in other situations depending on the social economic and environmental assets of a region changes to groundwater chemistry around a well that exceed a specified limit and may impact nearby water bores and groundwater dependent ecosystems is another potential metric assessment of changes to groundwater chemistry is found in the supplementary material 5 2 model conceptualisation conceptually for leaky bores or wells to have an impact on groundwater condition in water resource aquifers the following conditions need to be satisfied 1 a flow pathway exists i e the leaky gas well or water bore with a sufficiently high effective gas well water bore conductivity kw 2 a high enough hydraulic gradient between aquifer and depth interval where the connection occurs 3 the aquifer gas production zone transmissivity is high enough to sustain inter aquifer flow 4 aquitard conductivity kv is low enough that any flow through the gas well water bore is significantly greater than diffusive flow through a representative section of the aquitard 5 for aquifer contamination a significant difference in water quality exists between the overlying aquifer and production zone or deeper aquifer in addition to this for impact on groundwater condition to occur on a large scale 6 the well integrity failure density must be high enough to generate noticeable cumulative impact on inter aquifer flow based on this conceptualisation closed form analytical solutions were used to capture a broad but plausible spectrum of potential system parameters that could result in a change in flux across an aquitard separating two aquifers or an aquifer and a gas resource the analysis was used to estimate the well integrity failure density within a specified area of an aquitard that is required to produce a significant increase in the effective hydraulic conductivity of the aquitard and therefore leakage between aquifers we also investigated the limitations to flow through a leaky well whether they are constrained by the effective well conductivity or the transmissivity of the aquifers the results from the analysis were then constrained to the parameters space found in current literature 5 3 quantifying the potential impacts with analytical solutions a highly simplified three layer hydrogeological system was used to represent a well field with two aquifers separated by an aquitard fig 6 flow between the aquifers can occur through local pathways such as leaky wells or bores or by means of regionalised diffusive flow through the aquitard fig 6 the well field consists of a number of wells i a proportion of which are assumed to have failed causing leakage of fluid between aquifers the leaky wells each had a cross sectional area aw and an effective well conductivity kw fig 6a each well was assumed to be screened in the deeper aquifer gas production zone with connection to the upper aquifer due to loss of integrity through one of the pathways described above fig 6b considering the aquitard in fig 6a where aref m2 is the reference area of the aquitard considered in the flow analysis and a w i m2 is the cross sectional area of each leaky well i the density of leaky wells and keq is the equivalent hydraulic conductivity of the area aref taking into account the leaky wells ρ dimensionless is defined as 2 ρ 1 a ref i 0 n a w i where n is the number of leaky wells this diffusive flux q is composed of the sum of the flux through the leaky wells area q well and the flux q ref through the remaining area of the aquitard with reference hydraulic conductivity k ref by further assuming that the density of leaky wells ρ is very small 10 5 and by defining a significant increase in equivalent k due to the leaky wells as keq 2 kref a doubling or more of background flow between the aquifers an alternative expression for the density of leaky wells that significantly increases the equivalent conductivity of the aquitard can be derived 3 ρ k ref k w eq 3 is an expression to estimate the density of leaky wells ρ that is required to produce a significant change in flux across an aquitard flux though leaky wells which is greater than the flux though the reference area of the aquitard a full derivation is available in the supplementary material whether the flux through a single leaky well is limited by the well hydraulic conductivity can be estimated based on darcy s law using an effective well conductivity kw similarly to that described in nordbotten et al 2004 the ability of the aquifers to transmit water to or from the leaky well can be assessed using the thiem equation silliman and higgins 1990 a convolution integral was not used here as the conservative risk assessment is concerned with the maximum flow rate rather than the total rate over time when the system is in equilibrium the rates of flow into the well within the well and out of the well are equal assuming no loss to the aquitard by further assuming that the transmissivity of the gas production zone will be less than the overlying water bearing aquifer values of kw are obtained for which flow through the well is not limited by its hydraulic conductivity but rather by the transmissivity of the gas production zone aquifer 2 fig 5b 4 k w 1 9 t 2 d r w 2 where t is aquifer transmissivity d is the flow length along the leaky well and rw is the radius of the well and it is conservatively assumed that there is no further flow constraint at the point at which the well is screened within the aquifer under these conditions the low aquifer transmissivity is the limiting factor rather than vertical transmissivity through wells and as such any increase in the density of leaky wells has little effect on the overall vertical exchange of water again a full derivation is available in the supplementary material while some applications of these simple analytical models are discussed below eqs 2 and 3 were used to develop relationships between the equivalent hydraulic conductivity k eq of an aquitard incorporating a series of leaky wells and the well integrity failure density ρ effective well conductivity k w and the reference vertical aquifer conductivity kref this enabled a comparison of the parameters impacts on significant changes i e at least 10 increase in the equivalent conductivity of the aquitard keq eq 4 was used to better understand the role of aquifer transmissivity in limiting flow through wells plausible parameter ranges section 5 3 1 for well integrity failure rates kw and aquitard kv were obtained from previous studies king and king 2013 smith 2014 watson and bachu 2009 kell 2011 and used with the equations to indicate which parameter combinations were likely to result in significant impacts 5 3 1 typical parameter ranges from previous studies information on well integrity failure rates and the effective conductivity of leaky gas wells and water bores is limited and in the majority of cases estimates from onshore gas are mainly available from canadian and us shale gas and conventional gas examples kell 2011 king and king 2013 watson and bachu 2009 without specific information on australian conventional and csg wells we use these estimates for our assessments no specific information has been found for the effective conductivity of leaky water bores or coal exploration drillholes site specific transmissivity values for gas resources and aquifers aquitard thickness and vertical hydraulic conductivity and pressure head gradients across aquitards are generally more readily available transmissivity is generally within a range of 10 3 to 103 m2 d for csg formations and aquitard thickness is usually of the order of several hundred metres shanafield et al 2018 aquitard vertical hydraulic conductivity kv depends on the nature of the sedimentary material and presence of faults natural or induced fractures and other seal bypass systems such as intrusions kv generally ranges between 10 7 to 10 4 m d batlle aguilar et al 2016 turnadge et al 2016 for the case study in this paper the aquitard thickness varied from 500 to 650 m and k v varied from 10 6 to 10 3 m d smith 2014 head differences between the production targets and the pilliga sandstone were estimated from the groundwater model smith 2014 developed for the narrabri gas project eis and the bioregional assessments groundwater model for the namoi subregion sreekanth et al 2018a sreekanth et al 2018b the spatial and temporal range of head gradients between the production zone and the overlying aquifer from prior to production to immediately after production ceased but not including pressures associated with hydraulic fracturing itself was between 0 04 to 0 17 m m wu et al 2018 downward gradients were greatest immediately following the production period while upward gradients were highest prior to production lowest during and just after gas production and increased again as pressures in the production zone recovered over 100 or more years 5 3 2 well integrity failure rates as per king and king 2013 a barrier failure is defined as the failure of a single barrier to containing well pressure and fluids while well integrity failure requires all of the barriers to fail along a pathway for gas leakage between an aquifer and a gas production zone or between adjacent aquifers failure rates reported in the literature are typically based on gas migration as bore or well integrity failure is most commonly detected through surface casing vent flow scvf or gas migration gm measurements barrier and well failure rates from onshore and offshore oil conventional gas and coal seam shale gas wells were synthesised from 17 previous studies mostly from north america details of these studies and the failure rates are shown in table s4 in the supplementary material barrier failure rates ranged from 0 02 to 3 9 for onshore wells while offshore petroleum wells appeared to have higher rates of failure up to 50 after 15 years gulf of mexico it is possible that barrier failure may be defined differently for each type of well and construction standards will vary in time and between regions well integrity failure rates ranged from 0 004 to 0 06 for onshore petroleum wells in ohio and texas and between 1 3 and 9 8 for unconventional gas wells in the usa in australia no leaks have been reported in 6734 csg exploration appraisal and production wells in queensland while 0 3 of the wells have been found to have questionable cement quality during construction huddlestone holmes et al 2017 wu et al 2018 cased and abandoned wells had higher observed failure rates than drilled and abandoned open hole bores in alberta canada watson and bachu 2009 the failure rate of older legacy wells has been observed to exceed that of more modern wells bannerman et al 2005 kell 2011 two possible explanations for higher failure rates in older wells are stricter regulations for well construction and decommissioning in more recent times and the fact that in older wells more time has elapsed for corrosion and degradation of cement to take place watson and bachu 2009 however found no direct relationship between age of well and failure rate in alberta canada but rather a relationship between failure rates and well construction date relative to regulatory changes regulatory changes in australia include the queensland petroleum and gas production and safety act of 2004 queensland government 2004 and the nsw petroleum onshore act of 1991 new south wales government 1991 queensland and nsw codes of practice for well development monitoring and decommissioning accompany these acts department of natural resources mines and energy 2019 government 2012 5 3 3 effective well hydraulic conductivity cement hydraulic conductivity k c relates to the ease of passage of water through the cement matrix between the rock and the casing and between subsequent casings under normal conditions of well completion the conductivity of an intact cement matrix is usually around 0 001md to 0 1md or 10 7 to 10 5 m d appleby and wilson 1996 duguid et al 2013 wu et al 2018 however the conductivity may increase if the cemented well annulus degrades becomes damaged or forms cracks we define the effective well conductivity k w as the bulk vertical hydraulic conductivity of the well the result of water flowing through a combination of cracks and voids in the cement matrix micro annuli and fissures in the cement caused by delamination and through the cement matrix itself in other studies effective well conductivity or permeability is referred to as average permeability duguid et al 2013 bulk hydraulic characteristics crow et al 2010 effective vertical permeability gasda et al 2004 kang et al 2015 tao and bryant 2014 or vertical permeability of cement annulus carey et al 2007 we refer to hydraulic conductivity rather than permeability for the purposes of using the information in hydrogeological conceptualisations and numerical models hydraulic conductivity of unperturbed cement can be measured by analysis of core samples effective well conductivity estimation for integrity failures is less common but can be done using in situ methods such as vertical interference testing vit carey et al 2007 crow et al 2010 duguid et al 2013 or inferred from surface casing vent flow scvf information kang et al 2015 tao and bryant 2014 fig 7 shows porosity hydraulic conductivity relationships based on two data sets i small scale core samples reflecting unperturbed cement and ii large scale well data reflecting effective hydraulic conductivities and effective porosity that account for voids the core based data displays a positive linear relationship between cement conductivity and porosity the large scale effective well conductivity data unlike the core samples do not show a clear dependency on porosity especially within data sets importantly the effective well conductivities are higher than cement conductivity across the full porosity range this is best observed for the duguid et al 2013 data set where the effective well conductivity was around five orders of magnitude higher than unperturbed cement at low porosity about 30 and about two orders of magnitude higher at high porosity 60 70 for the crow et al 2010 data the effective conductivity was about three orders of magnitude higher than unperturbed cement at low porosity 10 20 and two orders of magnitude higher at high porosity 40 50 the overall lowest effective well conductivity was around 10 6 m d hawkes and gardner 2013 compared with an unperturbed cement conductivity of around 10 7 m d while the overall highest is around 10 1 m d duguid et al 2013 table s5 in the supplementary material summarises the cement properties for all data sets more recently kang et al 2015 and tao and bryant 2014 estimated the effective permeabilities of decommissioned petroleum wells based on scvf observations and detailed well construction records kang et al 2015 estimated that abandoned petroleum wells in pennsylvania had effective gas permeabilities of 10 6 to 102 md equivalent hydraulic conductivity of 10 9 to 10 1 m d assuming a temperature of around 20 c they also found that gas wells and combined oil and gas wells had higher effective conductivities than oil wells ranging between 10 1 and 102 md 10 4 to 10 1 m d tao and bryant 2014 estimated that the majority of leaky wells in british columbia have effective permeabilities of between 10 2 to 10 md 10 5 to 10 2 m d for the remainder of this paper three examples of well bore leakage were assumed with hydraulic conductivity values that span a wide and conservative range i a high flow leaky well with an effective conductivity of 10 1 m d representing the highest effective conductivity from previous studies fig 7 and similar to the kw 100md 8 1 10 2 m d as used by nordbotten et al 2009 ii an extremely high flow leaky gas well with effective conductivity of 102 m d which is around three orders of magnitude higher than the maximum effective conductivity currently estimated from previous studies fig 7 in order to test the relationships beyond the limits of conductivity that is currently found in literature and iii an open bore with an effective well conductivity of around 108 m d representing conditions where the bore is essentially an open pipe similar to the kw 6 3 108 m d from the example well problem in panday et al 2013 and supported by analysis using moody pipe friction factors for typical australian coal exploration hole parameters 5 4 analytical assessment results the significance of the closed form analytical expression eqs 2 and 3 can be best illustrated by considering an aquitard with reference zero leakage along wells hydraulic conductivity k ref between 10 6 to 10 2 m d a series of leaky wells perforate the aquifer having an effective well conductivity of either k w 102 m d fig 8 a or k w 10 1 m d fig 8b representing extremely high and high flow leaky wells respectively from these figures it can be observed that the well integrity failure density required to produce a significant 10 increase in inter aquifer flow is higher where the conductivity of the leaky well is low and the well integrity failure density required to produce a significant 10 increase in inter aquifer flow is higher when the aquitard vertical conductivity kref is high for extremely high flow leaky wells k eq deviates from k ref within the expected limits of potential well failure density ρ for aquitard conductivities of 10 3 m d fig 8a for the high flow leaky well case k eq does not deviate from the aquitard reference conductivity for k ref of 10 6 m d or greater fig 8b a higher failure rate than realistically possible is required to produce an effect on k eq in fig 8a representing an extremely high flow leaky well we denote two failed wells per square kilometre as the highest likely failure rate as this is the approximate density of wells drilled in or designed for australian coal seam gas developments a significant increase in keq 10 requires an aquitard kref of 10 3 m d this is within a plausible range for an aquitard which compares to the aquitard kh in the case study for fig 8b the high flow leaky well an aquitard kref of 10 6 m d is required for a significant increase in keq it is unlikely that an aquitard will have a hydraulic conductivity 10 6 m d to produce a significant increase in aquifer conductivity 10 through a high flow leaky well kw 10 1 m d and tight aquitard kref 10 6 m d compared with the natural flow through the aquitard the well integrity failure density needs to be 5 wells per square kilometre this requires a failure rate that is higher than the typical well installation density associated with gas developments for an extremely high flow leaky wells kw 102 m d significant aquitard conductivity is likely to occur where there is one leaky bore per square kilometre for aquitard hydraulic conductivity of 10 4 m d and less where the conditions for well integrity failure density and aquitard conductivity are realistic the well conductivity required for significant change in ke q is two orders of magnitude higher than any observed in recent studies for the ranges of well hydraulic conductivity aquitard hydraulic conductivity and well failure rates found in current literature it is extremely unlikely that leaky wells will result in significant changes to inter aquifer flow to better understand the role of aquifer hydraulic conductivity in limiting flow through leaky wells the closed form analytical expression in eq 3 was evaluated for a system based on the case study described above this allowed determination of the maximum possible flux through leaky wells bores for given aquifer conductivities which in turn helps to assess if significant changes to the aquitard conductivity are possible the system was comprised of a 114 m thick aquifer a 600 m thick aquitard and a 21 m thick csg production interval a head difference of 115 m between the aquifer and production interval was assumed smith 2014 for effective well conductivities less than 103 m d flow through the well q was logarithmically proportional to kw fig 9 a where kw was greater than 104 m d flow through the well q remained constant and limited by the conductivity of the gas production zone aquifer k h a high flow leaky well and extremely high flow leaky well were limited by effective well conductivity while an open bore was limited by the aquifer transmissivity fig 9b shows that for the model parameters used flow q through an open bore becomes limited as soon as the aquifer conductivity kh 103 m d from that moment onwards the maximum flow in an open bore has been reached the maximum flux q through the extremely high flow leaky well is determined by an aquifer conductivity kh 10 2 m d the maximum flux through the high flow leaky well is independent of aquifer conductivity for the full range of k h values considered 6 stage 3 site specific modelling of inter aquifer leakage the analytical analysis of passive water flow through a leaky decommissioned production well and water bore was followed by more detailed assessments using numerical groundwater flow models for single local scale and multiple wells sub regional scale based on simplified yet realistic parameters in the case study described in section 2 the technical expertise and computational resources required makes multi phase flow modelling impractical to estimate the impact on groundwater head from every proposed new gas well gas field or water bore that may have integrity issues this is especially the case for the screening of potential risks from hundreds if not thousands of potential gas wells or water bores at the regional level a high throughput conservative screening methodology is needed for wells bores that were identified by the screening method to be of potentially high risk a subsequent step could include use of more sophisticated simulators including multi phase models for the screening method single phase analytical assessment and groundwater models such as modflow harbaugh and mcdonald 1996 can provide more realistic and site specific insights into potential risks moore et al 2014 demonstrated that modflow over estimated the magnitude and rate of drawdown in coal seams due to extraction of water compared with the multi phase flow model eclipse indicating that single phase models provide a conservative estimate of drawdown the single phase approach used in this study neglects the presences of gas which can impede the movement of water within the rock matrix thereby slowing drawdown a simplified numerical model of flow through a single leaky well and a larger numerical model of whole proposed csg development were developed to assess i the relative contribution of a single leaky well or bore to inter aquifer groundwater flow compared with diffuse flow through the aquitard ii the maximum drawdown and iii the recovery time of the aquifer toward pre production pressure 6 1 numerical modelling of flow through a single well a groundwater flow model of a single vertical leaky gas well or water bore was developed to represent the simplified hydrogeological system composed of three layers aquifer pilliga sandstone layer 1 aquitard layer 2 and gas resource coal seams within the maules creek formation layer 3 modflow usg panday et al 2013 was used to develop the numerical model with an algomesh voronoi unstructured grid used to represent the hydrostratigraphy merrick 2015 the continuous linear network cln package enabled flow along conduits much smaller than the cell dimensions to be represented without requiring additional mesh discretisation panday et al 2013 the cln simulated flow through a conduit governed by a head gradient and resistance to flow through the conduit kw between the conduit and the aquifer matrix skin factor and through the connected aquifers kaq the circular model domain was defined with a 10 km radius around a single leaky well or bore defined such as to represent one of the three flow conditions an open bore k w 108 m d an extremely high flow leaky gas well or water bore k w 102 m d and a high flow leaky gas well or water bore k w 10 1 m d the voronoi mesh was defined with a maximum cell dimension of 750 m changing exponentially to a minimum cell size of 0 5 m adjacent to the well doble et al 2018 model parameters were based on that of a model of the proposed narrabri coals seam gas development smith 2014 are shown in the supplementary material table s6 and are described in more detail in doble et al 2018 the well radius was assumed to be 0 25 m which is conservatively larger than coal seam gas wells in australia flow through the leaky well was compared with the flow through a one square kilometre area of aquitard based on a density of one csg well per km2 for the case study area smith 2014 6 2 single well modelling results modelling of the leaky bore using modflow usg with a 115 m head difference 0 17 m m downward hydraulic gradient between the production zone and overlying aquifer indicated that there was very little change in inter aquifer flow compared with a fully sealed control for the leaky well 1 increase but a large change in inter aquifer flow for the open bore 37 times larger table s7 supplementary material increasing the aquifer kh tenfold did not significantly change the flow through the leaky well although it increased the flow through the open bore by an order of magnitude this again suggests that under these hydraulic conditions unrestricted flow through the open bore is limited by aquifer conductivity while flow through the leaky well is limited by well hydraulic conductivity drawdown in the overlying aquifer layer 1 was not within a detectable range for the high flow leaky well but estimated to be around 5 m near the open bore fig 10 a and 0 5 m at 1 km from the well after 10 years fig 10b due to the conservative well radius used in the modelling the drawdown is likely to be less than indicated in fig 10 6 3 modelling of multiple well integrity failures in a more detailed study of the case study a three dimensional five layer groundwater flow model of the whole region was developed using modflow usg the model was used to calculate groundwater drawdown for different rates of spatially randomised well integrity failure densities for the leaky well and open bore scenarios noorduijn et al 2017 depressurisation conditions typical of those during and after gas production section 5 3 1 were placed on the two modelled target csg formations maules creek and hoskissons formation and failure of wells was considered to occur only after gas production had ceased simulations of leaky wells included failure rates of between 0 no pathways and 100 all wells provide pathways of all 425 potential well pad sites as indicated in smith 2016 pathways were modelled using the continuous linear network cln package the possibility of clustered well integrity failures was incorporated by using a spatially correlated random failure approach with correlation distances of 2 km and 10 km noorduijn et al 2017 the same model was used to model potential inter aquifer leakage through open bores penetrating through the aquifer and target coal seam low failure density rates of 1 2 and 5 using the locations of the potential csg well sites were used to simulate the likely spatial distribution of water bores or fully open coal exploration drillholes a more detailed description of this modelling can be found in noorduijn et al 2017 the total vertical downward flow rate across the gas project area through the leaky wells towards the depressurised gas resource for the borefield was estimated to be 0 37 m3 d for the high flow leaky wells with a 100 failure density and 1500 m3 d for the open bores with a 5 failure density this is compared with a diffuse flow rate across the aquitard within the gas project area of 200 m3 day there was no difference in groundwater drawdown for the multiple well integrity failure modelling for well integrity failure rates between 0 and 100 of wells fig 12 a meaning that flow through the leaky wells was not high enough to cause a significant impact on groundwater heads in the overlying aquifer for flow through open bores the failure density did have a significant effect on drawdown fig 12b in this case the maximum drawdown close to an open well for the proposed development area was estimated to be approximately 3 m greater when 5 of wells provided a pathway between the production zones and the overlying aquifer compared with a zero open bore scenario a full set of results is presented in noorduijn et al 2017 7 discussion pathways for inter aquifer flow were assessed using a three stage process consisting of qualitative analysis closed form analytical equations and numerical modelling of single well and multiple well integrity failure scenarios the potential impact metrics that were assessed in this study were an increase in flow through a failed well compared with baseline flow through a representative area of regional aquitard resulting in head drawdown around a well this could affect adjacent water bores and groundwater dependent ecosystems from the analytical analysis it was indicated that high flow leaky wells kw 10 1 m d require a failure density of more than five wells per square kilometre and a tight aquitard kref 10 6 m d to have a significant impact on inter aquifer leakage while an aquitard with kref 10 6 m d is plausible in gas development regions a well density of more than two wells per square kilometre is unlikely which means a failure rate of 5 wells per square kilometre is highly unlikely for extremely high flow leaky wells kw 102 m d to have a significant effect on inter aquifer leakage required a failure density of one well per km2 and an aquitard kref 10 4 m d both of which are possible alternatively failure density kref couples of one well per 10 km2 and kref 10 5 m d or one well per 100 km2 and kref 10 6 m d are also likely to have observable effects on inter aquifer leakage to date kw values of 1 m d have not been reported in any studies it is unlikely that leaky gas wells would have a significant impact on groundwater heads but coal exploration drillholes or water bores with similar high flow leakage have the potential to enhance inter aquifer flow open wells representing legacy coal exploration drillholes and water bores in this analysis would result in high rates of inter aquifer leakage if they are drilled to a depth to intersect the csg production zone and left open however flow will be limited by aquifer or production zone transmissivity where kw is high and it is likely that flow within open wells would eventually be reduced by minor obstructions such as movement in the rock matrix in the numerical analysis of single wells drawdown in the overlying aquifer was not observed for a high flow leaky well with model parameterisation based on the case study of the proposed narrabri csg development area described in section 2 flow through an open well or bore that was assumed to have been drilled to the depth of a csg interval and left open resulted in a drawdown of 5 m near the well and 0 5 m at a distance of 1 km from the well after 10 years this amount of drawdown may have a significant consequence depending on the location and socioeconomic value of local groundwater dependent ecosystems or water bores for a multi well numerical model using model parameters based on those for the case study described in section 2 flow through a high flow leaky well kw 0 1 m d did not have a significant impact on groundwater drawdown for any well integrity failure density from 0 all wells intact to 100 all wells leaking the presence of hypothetical open exploration or water bores that are assumed to have been drilled to the csg interval and kept open however increased groundwater drawdown immediately after cessation of production by around 3 m with an open well density of one well per 46 km2 compared with an intact aquitard augmented inter aquifer flow through the opens bores was predicted to have a more local effect on groundwater levels rather than a widespread regional impact the case study of the proposed narrabri csg development area only provided one suite of parameters to be used in the single well and multi well modelling which may limit the applicability of the findings on other sites however the agreement between the site specific modelling and the analytical analysis which had a parameter range that spanned the distribution of parameters found in the global literature suggests that it did provide a realistic example which may be used to draw conclusions about likelihood of impacts on groundwater head all three assessment methods concurred that the flow through leaky wells via pathways through degraded cement or micro annuli was very small to negligible for conditions reported in previous studies and for the case study example extremely high flow leaky wells kw 102 m d such as wells with shear or tensile failure or legacy coal exploration drillholes and water bores may have a larger effect on groundwater drawdown and should be investigated further with a focus on estimating the range of possible kw and observed failure rates the effective well conductivities that define extremely high flow leaky wells are yet to be observed by field measurements in australia an audit of current and historical gas wells in australia is necessary to conclusively eliminate extremely high flow leaky wells as potential accelerators of inter aquifer flow there is a need to assess any existing data on coal exploration drillholes and degraded water bores to identify instances in which they intersect caprock or aquitards and form a pathway for inter aquifer flow better definition of plausible kw ranges and failure rates in drillholes and bores particularly in australian conditions is also required and more data on aquitard conductivity kref head gradients between aquifers and target coal seams and aquitard thicknesses are required for site specific investigations legacy open coal exploration drillholes and gas wells repurposed into water bores are a pathway prioritised for further analysis high rates of leakage are possible through old gas wells water bores or gas wells that have historically been repurposed into water bores detailed analysis of the likely impacts on groundwater including changes in water quality potential for surface spills to contaminate deeper aquifers and although out of scope for this paper gas leakage and migration should be undertaken before repurposing occurs legacy open coal exploration drillholes also have the potential for high rates of leakage with the clause that there is relatively little data for kw and it is possible that kw will reduce in time due to geological plasticity at large depths coal exploration drillholes are usually shallow as they target coal at mineable depths compared to csg wells therefore they are less likely to penetrate through any aquitards between gas production formations and shallow aquifers gas exploration wells are required to be cased to the same standard as production wells and correctly sealed when decommissioned for example government 2012 therefore their potential impacts on groundwater drawdown are more likely to be of the same type and magnitude as decommissioned production wells the different approaches of the three stage screening process of risk prioritisation analytical assessment single and multiple numerical analyses were assessed according to their relevant scope certainty limits and appropriateness table 4 the results from each of the approaches were then compared for each of the inter aquifer pathways table 5 open coal exploration drillholes and water bores were assessed to have a higher impact on groundwater head from single well modelling before the relative density of exploration bores or repurposed wells had been accounted for for failure densities of up to one well per 46 km2 the potential impact on groundwater head was expected to be moderate the anticipated impact of high flow leaky wells on groundwater head from the risk prioritisation assessment was higher than that estimated from the analytical and numerical modelling the potential impact was overestimated possibly because it was difficult to assess the severity of impact without numerically calculating flow rates through wells and related drawdown from the multiple well numerical modelling the total predicted flow through an open well scenario eg legacy boreholes at a well density of one well per 46 km2 was around four orders of magnitude higher than the high flow leaky well example at 100 failure with this hindsight the severity score given to compromised decommissioned wells should have been between 3 and 4 no impact to minimal impact the risk prioritisation relied on assumptions many of which were based on pre conceived ideas of likely impact although the estimated magnitude of impact varied the ranking of the pathway impacts was in the same order as the other modelling based results which supports the use of this approach for rapid assessment the main benefit of using multiple lines of evidence across the three stages to assess the potential impacts of different inter aquifer pathways is that each approach works at a different scale and scope the broad qualitative risk prioritisation captured both the physical components of the pathways as well as less quantifiable aspects such as codes of practice for construction and management which requires further detailed analysis behavioural and economic influences and constraints with reasonable background information and assumptions it can be used to extrapolate to estimate potential risks in locations and for pathways that have not yet been predicted numerically analytical assessment with highly simplified conceptualisation does not precisely capture the behaviour of a specific location but can be used to quickly and inexpensively assess pathways across the full range of potential parameterisation guidelines can be developed to prioritise pathways or developments for further investigation numerical modelling has an increasingly higher resource cost as the complexity of the models increase the modelling can capture the nuances associated with localised geology and hydrology but may over or under estimate the effect if the model conceptualisation or parameterisation varies too far from reality probabilistic modelling provides a range of potential impacts with estimates of likelihood of impact this study assumed that water movement through leaky gas wells can be modelled conservatively using a single phase groundwater flow model it did not attempt to analyse the impacts of pressure changes due to any hydraulic fracturing which is not proposed for the case study or gas production but passive flow through leaky wells or open bores driven by post production head gradients well integrity failure rates and effective well conductivity in australian conditions were assumed to be adequately defined by available data from north american studies to increase the confidence in the assessment of potential impacts to groundwater levels from inter aquifer leakage through compromised wells in australia a thorough review of well integrity failure rates associated with different types of development and ages of wells and bores is required preferably it should differentiate between failure of water bores csg wells oil and conventional gas wells and coal exploration drillholes due to differences in drilling depths separation distances between aquifers and production zones and aquifer and aquitard characteristics it should also include a review of cement and steel durability and degradation rates under australian conditions a review of the effective well conductivity kw of existing wells in australia is required also differentiating by well or bore types and ages longitudinal studies of the changes in kw in time increasing kw from ongoing degradation or decreasing kw from deep geological plasticity would be a significant contribution to risk analysis studies for resource development finally consistent definitions of hydrogeological well integrity failure rather than single barrier breach and the subsequent environmental impacts of the hydrogeological failures would increase the ability to compare incidences and effects across multiple resource oil gas and water production classes 8 conclusions a three stage multi scale screening approach was used for rapid assessment of the potential impacts to groundwater heads from accelerated inter aquifer leakage through gas wells legacy coal exploration drillholes and water bores semi quantitative risk prioritisation provided an indication of potential impact accounting for both severity and likelihood of occurrence and the time until detection analytical analysis was used to indicate under which conditions a pathway is likely to accelerate inter aquifer flow for the full spectrum of possible parameters and prioritise pathways for further assessment numerical analysis of the effects of single and multiple wells on aquifer drawdown for a case study near narrabri australia added a head gradient component to the assessment and supported the results from the analytical analysis from the assessments it is unlikely that high flow leaky wells effective well conductivity kw 10 1 m d based on the highest values found in literature will have an impact on groundwater resources in australia based on conditions described in current studies although extremely high well conductivities kw 102 m d were tested for numerical completeness their potential impact is restricted to limited conditions of high failure density and low aquitard conductivity and these higher rates of kw have not been demonstrated in field measurements to date international studies suggest a maximum kw of 1 m d fig 7 although there is no information on effective well conductivity for australian conditions leakage through legacy coal exploration drillholes and degraded water bores is less likely due to the spatial and vertical separation from deeper gas resources but cannot be ruled out until further information is provided on failure rates and plausible ranges of kw exploration drillholes may have kw decreasing with time due to geological plasticity acting to partially or fully reseal the drillhole the transmissivity of aquifers and target coal seams is likely to limit inter aquifer flow through drillholes and bores where kw is high the multiple well integrity failure model developed for the case study suggested that even if 100 of the proposed wells were compromised enough to create leakage pathways the effects on groundwater drawdown in the upper aquifer would be negligible leakage through open bores at a density of one well per 46 km2 was predicted to cause a maximum drawdown within the development area of around 2 m this multi stage screening process provided a useful approach for prioritising inter aquifer flow pathways and assessing where further more complex and costly quantification of impact and risk analysis was required each of the methods had different scopes certainty limitations and appropriateness for application the risk prioritisation and analytical modelling had wider scopes and covered a
