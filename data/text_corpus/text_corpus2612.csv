sensors 1 introduction over the last few decades different anthropogenic activities and population growth rates have contributed to the worsening of contamination in the environment 1 2 effluents released from industries include a mixture of inorganic and organic contaminants along with different heavy metals such as copper chromium arsenic lead cadmium selenium etc 3 wastewaters containing these contaminants are often released into the ecosystem air water soil without proper treatment resulting in severe global environmental problems most of the contaminants are non degradable and are toxic to different life forms 4 they are highly persistent in the ecosystem and accumulate in the food chain causing a detrimental effect on living systems and various health alterations chromium is an agrochemical element distributed in mineral soils rocks and freshwater various anthropogenic activities such as leather tanning pigment synthesis chromate mining metal electroplating textile dyeing fungicide and production of fertilizers are the different sources of chromium introduction into the aquatic ecosystems 5 chromium possesses different oxidation states in the environment but hexavalent and trivalent are the most stable forms different chromium vi compounds like dichromate cr2o7 2 chromate cro4 2 and chromate hcro4 owe their high solubility to diffusivity and toxicity which allows them to cross biological barriers easily resulting in alteration of cell structures 6 chromium has been designated a priority pollutant in different countries and the usepa cr vi is estimated to be thousand times more mutagenic and 100 times more toxic than trivalent cr 7 usepa has presented the permissible value of 0 1 mg l total chromium in potable drinking water 2 elevated cr vi concentrations cause detrimental health effects in humans such as kidney damage liver problem chronic bronchitis internal haemorrhage emphysema stomach cancer nasal irritation and dna damage 8 to safeguard human health aquatic life and the environment cr vi must be removed from wastewater and polluted water before it is discharged different technologies to remove cr vi from wastewater bodies include reverse osmosis chemical precipitation ion exchange chemical oxidation reduction lime coagulation solvent extraction electrodialysis and electrodeposition 9 all the above methods are expensive or ineffective when cr vi concentrations range above 1 to 100 ppm the use of fungi bacteria and algal bodies has also been reported for the detoxification of the cr vi into cr iii 10 the main drawback of using the biological removal technique is that microbial populations accumulate cr vi by biosorption and convert them into cr iii adsorption is regarded as one of the superior methods to these conventional and biological methods because of their cost effectiveness ability for regeneration simplicity and large scale applications 11 cr vi confiscation by adsorption techniques has been done by exploiting its biological bioremediation chemical chemisorption and physical physisorption properties owing to its high dissolution tendencies a plethora of various sources including activated carbons polymers nanoparticles bio sorbents graphene oxide biochar etc have been studied for removal of cr vi 12 15 functionalization of these materials sometimes results in carbon loss which is not ideal for adsorption removal of inorganic and organic contaminants by biochar depends on different adsorption mechanisms such as ion exchange precipitation pore filling and electrostatic interactions this depends on the physiological and chemical characteristics of the biochar such as the temperature of pyrolysis dosage effluent ph etc to date scientists are striving to search for a cost effective and suitable adsorbent for cr vi with excellent selectivity faster binding kinetics and adsorption capacity using a minimal dose of adsorbent the use of bacterial biochar for cr vi removal offers a novel class of materials in terms of cost effectiveness better performance and high selectivity the current study is an attempt to evaluate the potential of bacterial biochar bc formed from previously reported remediator for cr vi for the cr vi adsorption from simulated wastewater the adsorbent dosage initial cr vi concentration and ph were all controlled in each experiment subsequently the physicochemical and morphological properties of biochar were studied using ftir chns raman fesem and xrd the mode of adsorption and equilibrium capacity of adsorption was studied using different kinetics models and isotherms 2 material and methods 2 1 chemicals potassium dichromate sigma aldrich nutrient agar himedia nutrient broth himedia agar himedia sodium hydroxide merck and all other solvents such as nitric acid loba india were of highest purity 99 and analytical grade 2 2 culturing of the strain freeze dried culture of citrobacter freundii was obtained in a glass ampoule from the institute of microbial technology imtech chandigarh bearing mtcc code 8128 growth medium 3 nutrient broth was used for the aerobic culturing of the strain at ph 7 and temperature 30 c in a rotating orbital shaker orbitek scigenic a known amount of suspended bacterial culture using 0 5 mcfarland standards was transferred into fresh growth media for re culturing after growth observation in the liquid media a purity check of the strain was done using gram staining and other biochemical tests the culture was further streaked onto the growth media supplemented with 1 5 agar 2 3 biochar preparation to prepare the bacterial biochar the strain was allowed to enter the log phase until it reached 0 5 mcfarland standards and centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 6 min using a thermo centrifuge sorvall st 16 r the pellet was collected properly rinsed several times with deionized water and kept for drying at room temperature after that the pellet was grounded into a fine powder and was subjected to 200ocand 400 c in an air controlled hot air oven ketan vacuum oven digital for biochar preparation 2 4 biochar characterization pyrolyzed bacterial biochar 200 and 400 c was characterized by raman xrd ftir atr mode fesem bet and chns analysis raman spectra were collected with str 300 confocal raman spectrometer seki technotron corp japan with a 785 nm diode laser excitation source the raman scattering data were collected with 50 objective and with 600 blz diffraction grating and with laser power on the sample is 1 5 mw furthermore the data is collected for 10 s with 12 accumulation with peltier cooled ccd detector the data deconvolution was done by grams ai data processing software x ray diffractometer bruker d8 advance was used to determine the crystal structure of pyrolyzed biochar with a range of 10 50 2ɵ values with a scan rate of 5 min ftir bruker tensor ii with attenuated total reflectance atr mode was used to characterize the functionalization of both the biochar with a scan speed of 10 khz with a range of 400 3500 cm 1 fesem with eds zeiss ultra 55 was carried out to analyze the surface morphology and atomic composition of the pyrolyzed bacterial biochar specific surface area and pore volume data of the biochar were evaluated using micromeritics asap 2020 system to calculate the size of biochar and pore architecture elemental analysis of both the biochar was done with vario micro elementar germany after the chars were grounded using ball milling and the chns content was determined 2 5 point of zero charge salt addition methods were carried out by adding an equal amount of materials to a different set of sodium nitrate solutions at different ph values of the same ionic strength 16 the point of zero charge for biochar was determined in 40 ml of 0 1 m sodium nitrate solution with 0 2 g of biochar in different flasks the phi initial ph of each flask was adjusted to 2 11 using either hno3 1 10 1 m or naoh 1 10 1 m solutions using ph60 z ph tester apera instruments each flask was stirred in a shaker incubator orbitek scigenic for 24 h at room temperature after 24 h the ph of each flask was measured and labelled as phf the point of zero charge was calculated from the plot of change in ph δ ph phf phi against initial ph each experiment was repeated thrice and the mean data was recorded for studies 2 6 adsorption studies adsorption performance of the bacterial biochar was determined in the batch adsorption studies of cr vi at room temperature 0 1 g of bacterial char both 200o and 400 c were mixed with various concentrations of cr vi solutions in 100 ml of erlenmeyer flasks having a concentration of cr vi from 10 to 50 mg l after that the solution mixture was agitated in a temperature controlled shaker until equilibrium was obtained then each sample was collected at different time intervals were centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min and filtered using 0 25 μm filter paper the concentrations of the filtrate were evaluated using icp ms thermo x series ii effect of ph initial cr vi concentration adsorbent dosage the temperature was also performed effect of ph was explored from 2 to 11 with an adsorbent dosage of 1 g l and 10 mg l initial concentration of cr vi the optimum ph at which the maximum removal was obtained was further considered for the remaining studies effect of adsorbent dosage 1 to 5 g l and cr vi ion concentration on adsorption was also investigated 10 20 30 40 and 50 mg l the adsorption capacity and removal efficiency of the bacterial biochar were determined and calculated using relationships 1 and 2 respectively 1 removal percentage c o c t c o 100 2 adsorption capacity v c o c t m where co initial concentration mg l of cr vi and ct equilibrium concentration mg l of cr vi m is the mass g of the bacterial biochar and v volume l of the cr vi solution 3 results and discussion 3 1 raman characterization raman spectroscopic technique is a powerful method to quantify the extent of the degree of crystallinity of carbon materials 17 the raman data were collected in the range of 570 2200 cm 1 for carbon materials fig 1 shows that the two characteristic peaks at 1344 cm 1 and 1565 cm 1 are observed designated as g band and d band respectively the d band represents the sp3 hybridized disordered defective carbon material whereas g band represents the sp2 hybridized graphitic carbon material 18 the degree of disorder in carbon material can usually be measured by using the integral intensity ratio of g band ig and d band id i e id ig 17 the calculated id ig ratio for 2a and 2b samples was 3 50 and 3 25 respectively the deduced ratios were greater than 1 hence the carbon material is amorphous with a greater quantity of disorder defective structured carbon in sample 2b after cr vi adsorption the id ig ratio is decreased from 3 50 to 3 25 which means that the graphitic carbon is more pronounced this may be due to a chemical reaction between adsorbent and carbon material 19 21 3 2 ftir characterization of biochar ftir analysis is one of the most effective and important characterizations used to describe the structure and functional groups present in the biochar 22 23 biochar synthesized at 200 c is observed to have more heteroatom content compared to the one synthesized at 400 c this is evident from the presence of oh co oh co resonances at 3272 cm 1 1650 cm 1 1372 cm 1 and 1166 cm 1 respectively these stretching bending frequencies are observed to get diminished in the biochar synthesized at 400 c thus biochar 1a is expected to have more functionalization and thus interact more strongly with heavy metal contaminants other identifiable ftir resonances are marked out in fig 2 the ftir spectrum of biochar after adsorption was also analyzed a comparison of ftir spectra of pristine biochar and biochar after adsorption is given in supplementary file fig 1 significant changes in absorption of co co were observed after the adsorption this indicates the involvement of functional groups helps in driving the adsorption process 24 25 3 3 xrd spectrum powder xrd analysis of the biochar samples shows that the materials are amorphous fig 3 the sharp resonances in the sample could be attributed to the presence of inorganic impurities 26 however biochar synthesized at 400 c also consists of resonances identical to graphene oxide and reduced graphene oxide 27 this is due to the increased graphitization of carbon at a higher temperature it is also noticeable that the resonances corresponding to inorganic impurities are absent in samples analyzed after adsorption supplementary fig 2 3 4 sem and eds sem micrograph depicted in fig 4 shows that biochar made at 200 c is composed of numerous aggregated particles with a rough surface on the other hand biochar made at 400 c is composed of larger fused particles with a smoother surface texture the morphology appears to be more crystalline with sharper edges which agrees with xrd data further analysis of the sem images indicates the size of aggregated particles to be around 0 5 μm supplementary fig 3 eds analysis shows that the biochar is composed of carbon and oxygen sem morphology after adsorption studies shows cr particles embedded on the surface of the biochar matrix eds analysis of biochar after adsorption further confirms the successful incorporation of cr vi into the adsorbent matrix fig 4 3 5 elemental analysis the elemental analysis results of bacterial biochar both 200 c and 400 c are shown in fig 5 it was observed that increasing the pyrolysis temperature bacterial biochar became more carbonaceous with carbon percentage increasing from 49 14 0 84 to 52 54 0 91 other major elements were nitrogen hydrogen and sulfur with the increase in pyrolysis temperature from 200 to 400 c a slight decrease in nitrogen hydrogen and sulfur concentrations were observed these changes are common and are consistent with the previous findings this is due to the enhancement of the aromaticity of biochar when there is a decrease in polarity this decrease in organic carbon mineralization also implies a decrease in the nutrient availability bounded in the organic structure of bacterial biochar such as n p and s 28 30 3 6 bet measurements on performing the bet experiment it is found that the pore volume of the sample has decreased by a factor of 10 in the case of the biochar 400 after adsorption 31 the bet surface area is also seen to decrease from 22 09 m2 g to 3 17 m2 g the loss in surface area and pore volume makes successful adsorption evident the nature of the isotherms for both the pristine biochar sample and the sample after adsorption are depicted in fig 6 the isotherm is seen to have considerably low adsorption in the low pressure regions a steady increase in both cases is noticed after a point while in the case of the untreated sample we have a higher maximum value of gas adsorbed after the micropores are filled the adsorption of the gas increases abruptly depicting a transition to multilayer formation a hysteresis is noticed at a region with p p0 0 5 which might indicate the presence of mesopores and macropores in the system at relative pressures higher than 0 9 i e at a region of higher adsorption capillary condensation of n2 is noticed this is more pronounced in the case of the pristine sample before treatment due to the availability of a larger number of mesopores and macropores 32 hence the pore architectures of the sample before adsorption exhibits high surface area and pore volume values which are beneficial for the studied applications 3 7 point of zero charge electrokinetic properties of both the biochar were determined to elucidate the reaction mechanism between the adsorbent and the cr vi the experimental plots of phi vs δph obtained using the salt addition method are represented in fig 7 phpzc was obtained at an ionic strength of 0 1 m in the ph range of 2 to 11 the changes in ph values are positive with the highest value of 1 91 at ph 4 the point of zero charge obtained for bacterial biochar is 6 78 for biochar produced at 200 c and 7 2 for biochar produced at 400 c respectively at room temperature the point of zero charge for both the biochar was a little bit higher than previously reported for modified corn stalks 6 5 33 and lesser than biochar from oak wood ph 8 0 34 3 8 effect of ph on cr vi removal using biochar solution ph is an important factor that regulates the process of adsorption as represented in fig 8 adsorption of cr vi ions using bacterial based biochar s is ph dependent and the removal percentage declines with an increase in ph from 3 to 9 the removal efficiency of cr vi decreased from 2 to 11 in the case of both the biochar cr vi mostly occurs in different forms of hcr2o7 cro4 2 h2cro4 hcro4 1 and cr2o7 2 out of these five forms hcro4 1 and cro4 2 is the most predominant form at ph 2 and ph less than 7 respectively h2cro4 anions are seen at ph greater than 1 and cr2o7 2 exists at ph 2 0 at low ph pronation occurs between adsorbent and dichromate ions in which the biochar becomes positively charged resulting in the development of electrostatic interactions thus the highest removal efficiency was observed at ph 2 and drastic declination above 3 this poor adsorption rate above ph 3 may be attributed to competing for adsorption between cr vi and oh ions our results are in good agreement with the previous findings in which the maximum removal of cr vi was observed at ph 2 using a surface modified cocoa shell 35 3 9 effect of adsorbent dosage for cr vi removal using biochar the correlation between the heavy metals and the adsorbent dosage can be attributed to the availability of sites and increased surface area of the adsorbent 36 the effect of adsorption dosage on cr vi removal was evaluated at different doses ranging from 1 to 5 mg l fig 9 the minimum removal efficiency of 56 24 and 84 19 was observed at dose 1 mg l and it increases to a maximum value of 74 59 and 93 52 at dosage 5 mg l in case of 200 and 400 respectively it can be concluded that in the initial stage the rate of cr vi uptake on biochar was high due to the availability of vacant adsorption sites for binding an increase in adsorption results in the saturation of the biochar s sites for cr vi adsorption which shows a robust decrease in the removal rate at above 4 g l an increase in biochar concentration didn t significantly alter the removal efficiency due to the establishment of equilibrium or saturation between the cr vi ions and biochar thus at equilibrium the adsorption is difficult because of electrostatic repulsive forces between cr vi ions and the biochar surface 3 10 effect of initial ion concentration for cr vi removal using biochar in batch adsorption studies the rate of adsorption is proportional or a function of the initial concentration of cr vi ions which is directly linked to the effective adsorption process the effect of initial ion concentration between the bacterial biochar and cr vi was conducted at a fixed adsorbent dosage of 1 g l ph 3 but varying cr vi dosages at different time intervals fig 10 represents the adsorption capacity and removal efficiency of cr vi using different biochar the adsorption capacity of cr vi ions increases with an increase in cr vi concentration whereas the percentage removal decreases this is because biochar contains a finite number of sites that get saturated when a certain concentration is reached the higher concentration gradient and motive force of mass transfer improve the penetration of contaminants molecules into the internal pores and layers of the adsorbent structure can increase the adsorption capacity by increasing the initial concentration of adsorbate 37 this experiment depicts the driving force to take over the mass transfer resistance between the biochar and the cr vi concentration thereby high concentration of cr vi ions increases the adsorption capacity 3 11 effect of temperature and thermodynamic calculations the adsorption of cr vi ions on bacterial biochar were also determined as a temperature function adsorption studies were carried out under ideal conditions and at temperatures ranging from 298 k to 313 k to evaluate the effect of temperature on mv adsorption effectiveness thermodynamic parameters such as free energy δg entropy δs and enthalpy δh of the adsorption can be calculated by using the below equations plot between 1 t versus lnklis depicted in fig 11 for both the bacterial biochars the values of δs and δh can be determined from the intercept and the slope respectively a negative value of δg confirms the feasibility and spontaneous nature of the adsorption process for cr vi a positive value of δh represents the endothermic nature of the adsorption increased randomness at the biochar and cr vi interface is assigned to the positive value of δs during adsorption processes g rtlnk l r gas constant 8 314 j mol k kl equilibrium constant qe ce and t temperature and the value of equilibrium constant was calculated by using k l q e c e ce and qe are equilibrium concentrations of cr vi on the biochar and in the solution also δg δh tδs equations can be rewritten as lnk l δs o r δh o rt batch adsorption studies were conducted by varying the temperature from 298 k to 313 k with a fixed concentration of 10 mg l at ph 2 and adsorbent dosage of 1 g l of both the biochars increase in temperature from 298 k to 313 k decreases the removal efficiency from 56 24 to 53 84 in case of 200 c and 84 19 to 82 68 in case of 400 c respectively the adsorption capacity of both the bacterial biochar was slightly low at the temperature change this could be either due to the unavailability of active sites by expansion while changing the temperature or by molecular diffusion of the pores the cr vi adsorption efficiency decreases as the temperature increases for both biochar indicating exothermic adsorption process the decrease in adsorption efficiency as temperature rises could be attributable to a number of variables including the biochar molecules greater ability to separate from the cr vi surface and release into the solution this is also attributed to a decrease in viscosity of the solution which weakens the adsorption forces between the biochar and cr vi leading to low removal efficiency this indicates that 298 k is the optimum temperature for cr vi adsorption onto bacterial biochar the effect of different temperatures on cr vi removal using two different biochar is shown in table 1 3 12 kinetic modeling for adsorption studies seven different models were applied to the current study to understand the potential rate limiting steps and reaction pathways of the adsorption of the cr vi onto both the pyrolyzed biochar 38 39 supplementary table 1 out of seven two models pseudo second order type 1 type2 and elovich models are well fitted for 200 c biochar and one model pseudo second order type 2 for 400 c constants of both the pseudo models were determined from the intercept and slope of the linear lot between t versus t q for pseudo second order and 1 q vs 1 t fig 12 the correlation coefficient for second order was comparatively high compared to pseudo first order kinetics table 2 the experimental qe in the case of the first order model is not equal to the calculated qe suggesting the inefficiency of the model to fit with the data whereas in the case of second order the experimental data is approximately coinciding with calculated data with a high correlation factor so it was inferred that adsorption of cr vi onto biochar is due to chemisorption with involvement of valency forces through exchange or sharing of electron between cr vi and biochars 24 40 the kinetic data obtained from pseudo order kinetics fig 12 and elovich model fig 13 reveals that the adsorption rate of cr vi using biochars solely depends on the actives sites of the biochars 41 42 3 13 adsorption isotherms adsorption isotherms are an important tool for understanding the behaviour and nature of the surface of the selected adsorbent i e biochars the adsorption data of the selected biochars were subjected to different isotherms such as langmuir eq 1 freundlich eq 2 and temkin eq 3 the langmuir constant qmax and kl were calculated from the intercept and the slope of the plot ce qe in freundlich isotherms constants n and kf were calculated from the slope and the intercept of the straight line by plotting lnce versus lnqe in temkin isotherms constants a and b were calculated from the slope and intercept of the plot lnce versus qe the value of a b and r2 showed favourable adsorption of cr vi on bacterial biochar the linear form of three isotherms is represented in eqs 1 to 3 2 qe k f ce 1 n 3 q e blna t blnc e the maximum adsorption of cr vi on different biochars was 19 43 mg g for 200 c biochar and 29 73 mg g for 400 c respectively with a good value of correlation efficiency table 3 this represents the monolayer adsorption of cr vi on the surface of both the biochars in comparing the r2 of all the selected three isotherms it is concluded that cr vi adsorption was fitted well with freundlich and langmuir isotherms under the cr vi concentration range of 10 to 50 mg l figs 14 and 15 however both the models langmuir and freundlich fit the experimental data quite better as compared to the temkin models this represents that the cr vi adsorption on bacterial biochar is a process that represents monolayer adsorption thus bacterial biochar offered much higher cr vi adsorption capacity qmax 19 43 and 29 73 mg g than previously reported adsorbents such as zvi biochar 10 60 mg g 43 and microalgal based materials 25 19 mg g 44 in their case a comparison of different carbonaceous materials used for cr vi removal is illustrated in table 4 3 14 regeneration of the biochar the reusability of biochar pyrolyzed at 400 c up five consecutive performances was also investigated using 0 1 m of hno3 and the results are represented in fig 16 the removal efficiency of the adsorption capacity of the biochar decreases with increasing the steps of regeneration steps and reusing biochar this is due to the damage of the active sites or saturation at the surface of the biochar this biochar is reusable up to four times with efficiency ranging from 68 16 to 88 13 after the fourth cycle the regeneration percentage declines to 54 47 4 conclusion this research study used pyrolyzed bacteria at two temperatures for cr vi removal from synthetic solution at a high temperature of carbonization it was observed that process of adsorption is highly effective at low ph the low temperature pyrolyzed biochar was expected to have higher interaction and better adsorption due to better surface functionalization however higher carbonization results in a biochar having higher graphitic content with edge defects providing higher surface area this increases the adsorption capacity relative to biochar synthesized at lower pyrolysis temperature even though both biochars have similar interactions with chromium the sem eds ftir xrd and raman analysis confirms adsorption of cr vi the maximum adsorption efficiency of cr vi was observed under optimized conditions of dose 1 g l ph 2 of the solution and temperature 298 k the adsorption data is fitted to pseudo second order kinetics and are best supported to freundlich model and langmuir model with qmax of 19 43 and 29 73 mg g the adsorption decreased at a higher temperature and the adsorption process was endothermic and spontaneous the present work is a clear indication that the biochar material can be suitably used for the removal of cr vi from

specific surface area and pore volume data of the biochar were evaluated using micromeritics asap 2020 system to calculate the size of biochar and pore architecture elemental analysis of both the biochar was done with vario micro elementar germany after the chars were grounded using ball milling and the chns content was determined 2 5 point of zero charge salt addition methods were carried out by adding an equal amount of materials to a different set of sodium nitrate solutions at different ph values of the same ionic strength 16 the point of zero charge for biochar was determined in 40 ml of 0 1 m sodium nitrate solution with 0 2 g of biochar in different flasks the phi initial ph of each flask was adjusted to 2 11 using either hno3 1 10 1 m or naoh 1 10 1 m solutions using ph60 z ph tester apera instruments each flask was stirred in a shaker incubator orbitek scigenic for 24 h at room temperature after 24 h the ph of each flask was measured and labelled as phf the point of zero charge was calculated from the plot of change in ph δ ph phf phi against initial ph each experiment was repeated thrice and the mean data was recorded for studies 2 6 adsorption studies adsorption performance of the bacterial biochar was determined in the batch adsorption studies of cr vi at room temperature 0 1 g of bacterial char both 200o and 400 c were mixed with various concentrations of cr vi solutions in 100 ml of erlenmeyer flasks having a concentration of cr vi from 10 to 50 mg l after that the solution mixture was agitated in a temperature controlled shaker until equilibrium was obtained then each sample was collected at different time intervals were centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min and filtered using 0 25 μm filter paper the concentrations of the filtrate were evaluated using icp ms thermo x series ii effect of ph initial cr vi concentration adsorbent dosage the temperature was also performed effect of ph was explored from 2 to 11 with an adsorbent dosage of 1 g l and 10 mg l initial concentration of cr vi the optimum ph at which the maximum removal was obtained was further considered for the remaining studies effect of adsorbent dosage 1 to 5 g l and cr vi ion concentration on adsorption was also investigated 10 20 30 40 and 50 mg l the adsorption capacity and removal efficiency of the bacterial biochar were determined and calculated using relationships 1 and 2 respectively 1 removal percentage c o c t c o 100 2 adsorption capacity v c o c t m where co initial concentration mg l of cr vi and ct equilibrium concentration mg l of cr vi m is the mass g of the bacterial biochar and v volume l of the cr vi solution 3 results and discussion 3 1 raman characterization raman spectroscopic technique is a powerful method to quantify the extent of the degree of crystallinity of carbon materials 17 the raman data were collected in the range of 570 2200 cm 1 for carbon materials fig 1 shows that the two characteristic peaks at 1344 cm 1 and 1565 cm 1 are observed designated as g band and d band respectively the d band represents the sp3 hybridized disordered defective carbon material whereas g band represents the sp2 hybridized graphitic carbon material 18 the degree of disorder in carbon material can usually be measured by using the integral intensity ratio of g band ig and d band id i e id ig 17 the calculated id ig ratio for 2a and 2b samples was 3 50 and 3 25 respectively the deduced ratios were greater than 1 hence the carbon material is amorphous with a greater quantity of disorder defective structured carbon in sample 2b after cr vi adsorption the id ig ratio is decreased from 3 50 to 3 25 which means that the graphitic carbon is more pronounced this may be due to a chemical reaction between adsorbent and carbon material 19 21 3 2 ftir characterization of biochar ftir analysis is one of the most effective and important characterizations used to describe the structure and functional groups present in the biochar 22 23 biochar synthesized at 200 c is observed to have more heteroatom content compared to the one synthesized at 400 c this is evident from the presence of oh co oh co resonances at 3272 cm 1 1650 cm 1 1372 cm 1 and 1166 cm 1 respectively these stretching bending frequencies are observed to get diminished in the biochar synthesized at 400 c thus biochar 1a is expected to have more functionalization and thus interact more strongly with heavy metal contaminants other identifiable ftir resonances are marked out in fig 2 the ftir spectrum of biochar after adsorption was also analyzed a comparison of ftir spectra of pristine biochar and biochar after adsorption is given in supplementary file fig 1 significant changes in absorption of co co were observed after the adsorption this indicates the involvement of functional groups helps in driving the adsorption process 24 25 3 3 xrd spectrum powder xrd analysis of the biochar samples shows that the materials are amorphous fig 3 the sharp resonances in the sample could be attributed to the presence of inorganic impurities 26 however biochar synthesized at 400 c also consists of resonances identical to graphene oxide and reduced graphene oxide 27 this is due to the increased graphitization of carbon at a higher temperature it is also noticeable that the resonances corresponding to inorganic impurities are absent in samples analyzed after adsorption supplementary fig 2 3 4 sem and eds sem micrograph depicted in fig 4 shows that biochar made at 200 c is composed of numerous aggregated particles with a rough surface on the other hand biochar made at 400 c is composed of larger fused particles with a smoother surface texture the morphology appears to be more crystalline with sharper edges which agrees with xrd data further analysis of the sem images indicates the size of aggregated particles to be around 0 5 μm supplementary fig 3 eds analysis shows that the biochar is composed of carbon and oxygen sem morphology after adsorption studies shows cr particles embedded on the surface of the biochar matrix eds analysis of biochar after adsorption further confirms the successful incorporation of cr vi into the adsorbent matrix fig 4 3 5 elemental analysis the elemental analysis results of bacterial biochar both 200 c and 400 c are shown in fig 5 it was observed that increasing the pyrolysis temperature bacterial biochar became more carbonaceous with carbon percentage increasing from 49 14 0 84 to 52 54 0 91 other major elements were nitrogen hydrogen and sulfur with the increase in pyrolysis temperature from 200 to 400 c a slight decrease in nitrogen hydrogen and sulfur concentrations were observed these changes are common and are consistent with the previous findings this is due to the enhancement of the aromaticity of biochar when there is a decrease in polarity this decrease in organic carbon mineralization also implies a decrease in the nutrient availability bounded in the organic structure of bacterial biochar such as n p and s 28 30 3 6 bet measurements on performing the bet experiment it is found that the pore volume of the sample has decreased by a factor of 10 in the case of the biochar 400 after adsorption 31 the bet surface area is also seen to decrease from 22 09 m2 g to 3 17 m2 g the loss in surface area and pore volume makes successful adsorption evident the nature of the isotherms for both the pristine biochar sample and the sample after adsorption are depicted in fig 6 the isotherm is seen to have considerably low adsorption in the low pressure regions a steady increase in both cases is noticed after a point while in the case of the untreated sample we have a higher maximum value of gas adsorbed after the micropores are filled the adsorption of the gas increases abruptly depicting a transition to multilayer formation a hysteresis is noticed at a region with p p0 0 5 which might indicate the presence of mesopores and macropores in the system at relative pressures higher than 0 9 i e at a region of higher adsorption capillary condensation of n2 is noticed this is more pronounced in the case of the pristine sample before treatment due to the availability of a larger number of mesopores and macropores 32 hence the pore architectures of the sample before adsorption exhibits high surface area and pore volume values which are beneficial for the studied applications 3 7 point of zero charge electrokinetic properties of both the biochar were determined to elucidate the reaction mechanism between the adsorbent and the cr vi the experimental plots of phi vs δph obtained using the salt addition method are represented in fig 7 phpzc was obtained at an ionic strength of 0 1 m in the ph range of 2 to 11 the changes in ph values are positive with the highest value of 1 91 at ph 4 the point of zero charge obtained for bacterial biochar is 6 78 for biochar produced at 200 c and 7 2 for biochar produced at 400 c respectively at room temperature the point of zero charge for both the biochar was a little bit higher than previously reported for modified corn stalks 6 5 33 and lesser than biochar from oak wood ph 8 0 34 3 8 effect of ph on cr vi removal using biochar solution ph is an important factor that regulates the process of adsorption as represented in fig 8 adsorption of cr vi ions using bacterial based biochar s is ph dependent and the removal percentage declines with an increase in ph from 3 to 9 the removal efficiency of cr vi decreased from 2 to 11 in the case of both the biochar cr vi mostly occurs in different forms of hcr2o7 cro4 2 h2cro4 hcro4 1 and cr2o7 2 out of these five forms hcro4 1 and cro4 2 is the most predominant form at ph 2 and ph less than 7 respectively h2cro4 anions are seen at ph greater than 1 and cr2o7 2 exists at ph 2 0 at low ph pronation occurs between adsorbent and dichromate ions in which the biochar becomes positively charged resulting in the development of electrostatic interactions thus the highest removal efficiency was observed at ph 2 and drastic declination above 3 this poor adsorption rate above ph 3 may be attributed to competing for adsorption between cr vi and oh ions our results are in good agreement with the previous findings in which the maximum removal of cr vi was observed at ph 2 using a surface modified cocoa shell 35 3 9 effect of adsorbent dosage for cr vi removal using biochar the correlation between the heavy metals and the adsorbent dosage can be attributed to the availability of sites and increased surface area of the adsorbent 36 the effect of adsorption dosage on cr vi removal was evaluated at different doses ranging from 1 to 5 mg l fig 9 the minimum removal efficiency of 56 24 and 84 19 was observed at dose 1 mg l and it increases to a maximum value of 74 59 and 93 52 at dosage 5 mg l in case of 200 and 400 respectively it can be concluded that in the initial stage the rate of cr vi uptake on biochar was high due to the availability of vacant adsorption sites for binding an increase in adsorption results in the saturation of the biochar s sites for cr vi adsorption which shows a robust decrease in the removal rate at above 4 g l an increase in biochar concentration didn t significantly alter the removal efficiency due to the establishment of equilibrium or saturation between the cr vi ions and biochar thus at equilibrium the adsorption is difficult because of electrostatic repulsive forces between cr vi ions and the biochar surface 3 10 effect of initial ion concentration for cr vi removal using biochar in batch adsorption studies the rate of adsorption is proportional or a function of the initial concentration of cr vi ions which is directly linked to the effective adsorption process the effect of initial ion concentration between the bacterial biochar and cr vi was conducted at a fixed adsorbent dosage of 1 g l ph 3 but varying cr vi dosages at different time intervals fig 10 represents the adsorption capacity and removal efficiency of cr vi using different biochar the adsorption capacity of cr vi ions increases with an increase in cr vi concentration whereas the percentage removal decreases this is because biochar contains a finite number of sites that get saturated when a certain concentration is reached the higher concentration gradient and motive force of mass transfer improve the penetration of contaminants molecules into the internal pores and layers of the adsorbent structure can increase the adsorption capacity by increasing the initial concentration of adsorbate 37 this experiment depicts the driving force to take over the mass transfer resistance between the biochar and the cr vi concentration thereby high concentration of cr vi ions increases the adsorption capacity 3 11 effect of temperature and thermodynamic calculations the adsorption of cr vi ions on bacterial biochar were also determined as a temperature function adsorption studies were carried out under ideal conditions and at temperatures ranging from 298 k to 313 k to evaluate the effect of temperature on mv adsorption effectiveness thermodynamic parameters such as free energy δg entropy δs and enthalpy δh of the adsorption can be calculated by using the below equations plot between 1 t versus lnklis depicted in fig 11 for both the bacterial biochars the values of δs and δh can be determined from the intercept and the slope respectively a negative value of δg confirms the feasibility and spontaneous nature of the adsorption process for cr vi a positive value of δh represents the endothermic nature of the adsorption increased randomness at the biochar and cr vi interface is assigned to the positive value of δs during adsorption processes g rtlnk l r gas constant 8 314 j mol k kl equilibrium constant qe ce and t temperature and the value of equilibrium constant was calculated by using k l q e c e ce and qe are equilibrium concentrations of cr vi on the biochar and in the solution also δg δh tδs equations can be rewritten as lnk l δs o r δh o rt batch adsorption studies were conducted by varying the temperature from 298 k to 313 k with a fixed concentration of 10 mg l at ph 2 and adsorbent dosage of 1 g l of both the biochars increase in temperature from 298 k to 313 k decreases the removal efficiency from 56 24 to 53 84 in case of 200 c and 84 19 to 82 68 in case of 400 c respectively the adsorption capacity of both the bacterial biochar was slightly low at the temperature change this could be either due to the unavailability of active sites by expansion while changing the temperature or by molecular diffusion of the pores the cr vi adsorption efficiency decreases as the temperature increases for both biochar indicating exothermic adsorption process the decrease in adsorption efficiency as temperature rises could be attributable to a number of variables including the biochar molecules greater ability to separate from the cr vi surface and release into the solution this is also attributed to a decrease in viscosity of the solution which weakens the adsorption forces between the biochar and cr vi leading to low removal efficiency this indicates that 298 k is the optimum temperature for cr vi adsorption onto bacterial biochar the effect of different temperatures on cr vi removal using two different biochar is shown in table 1 3 12 kinetic modeling for adsorption studies seven different models were applied to the current study to understand the potential rate limiting steps and reaction pathways of the adsorption of the cr vi onto both the pyrolyzed biochar 38 39 supplementary table 1 out of seven two models pseudo second order type 1 type2 and elovich models are well fitted for 200 c biochar and one model pseudo second order type 2 for 400 c constants of both the pseudo models were determined from the intercept and slope of the linear lot between t versus t q for pseudo second order and 1 q vs 1 t fig 12 the correlation coefficient for second order was comparatively high compared to pseudo first order kinetics table 2 the experimental qe in the case of the first order model is not equal to the calculated qe suggesting the inefficiency of the model to fit with the data whereas in the case of second order the experimental data is approximately coinciding with calculated data with a high correlation factor so it was inferred that adsorption of cr vi onto biochar is due to chemisorption with involvement of valency forces through exchange or sharing of electron between cr vi and biochars 24 40 the kinetic data obtained from pseudo order kinetics fig 12 and elovich model fig 13 reveals that the adsorption rate of cr vi using biochars solely depends on the actives sites of the biochars 41 42 3 13 adsorption isotherms adsorption isotherms are an important tool for understanding the behaviour and nature of the surface of the selected adsorbent i e biochars the adsorption data of the selected biochars were subjected to different isotherms such as langmuir eq 1 freundlich eq 2 and temkin eq 3 the langmuir constant qmax and kl were calculated from the intercept and the slope of the plot ce qe in freundlich isotherms constants n and kf were calculated from the slope and the intercept of the straight line by plotting lnce versus lnqe in temkin isotherms constants a and b were calculated from the slope and intercept of the plot lnce versus qe the value of a b and r2 showed favourable adsorption of cr vi on bacterial biochar the linear form of three isotherms is represented in eqs 1 to 3 2 qe k f ce 1 n 3 q e blna t blnc e the maximum adsorption of cr vi on different biochars was 19 43 mg g for 200 c biochar and 29 73 mg g for 400 c respectively with a good value of correlation efficiency table 3 this represents the monolayer adsorption of cr vi on the surface of both the biochars in comparing the r2 of all the selected three isotherms it is concluded that cr vi adsorption was fitted well with freundlich and langmuir isotherms under the cr vi concentration range of 10 to 50 mg l figs 14 and 15 however both the models langmuir and freundlich fit the experimental data quite better as compared to the temkin models this represents that the cr vi adsorption on bacterial biochar is a process that represents monolayer adsorption thus bacterial biochar offered much higher cr vi adsorption capacity qmax 19 43 and 29 73 mg g than previously reported adsorbents such as zvi biochar 10 60 mg g 43 and microalgal based materials 25 19 mg g 44 in their case a comparison of different carbonaceous materials used for cr vi removal is illustrated in table 4 3 14 regeneration of the biochar the reusability of biochar pyrolyzed at 400 c up five consecutive performances was also investigated using 0 1 m of hno3 and the results are represented in fig 16 the removal efficiency of the adsorption capacity of the biochar decreases with increasing the steps of regeneration steps and reusing biochar this is due to the damage of the active sites or saturation at the surface of the biochar this biochar is reusable up to four times with efficiency ranging from 68 16 to 88 13 after the fourth cycle the regeneration percentage declines to 54 47 4 conclusion this research study used pyrolyzed bacteria at two temperatures for cr vi removal from synthetic solution at a high temperature of carbonization it was observed that process of adsorption is highly effective at low ph the low temperature pyrolyzed biochar was expected to have higher interaction and better adsorption due to better surface functionalization however higher carbonization results in a biochar having higher graphitic content with edge defects providing higher surface area this increases the adsorption capacity relative to biochar synthesized at lower pyrolysis temperature even though both biochars have similar interactions with chromium the sem eds ftir xrd and raman analysis confirms adsorption of cr vi the maximum adsorption efficiency of cr vi was observed under optimized conditions of dose 1 g l ph 2 of the solution and temperature 298 k the adsorption data is fitted to pseudo second order kinetics and are best supported to freundlich model and langmuir model with qmax of 19 43 and 29 73 mg g the adsorption decreased at a higher temperature and the adsorption process was endothermic and spontaneous the present work is a clear indication that the biochar material can be suitably used for the removal of cr vi from

13061,the presence of antibiotic residues such as ciprofloxacin cipr in an aqueous environment is dangerous when their concentrations exceed the allowable therefore eliminating these residues from the wastewater becomes an essential issue to prevent their harm in this work the potential of efficient adsorption of ciprofloxacin antibiotics was studied using eco friendly zsm 5 nanocrystals carbon composite nzc an inexpensive effective natural binder made of the sucrose citric acid mixture was used for preparing nzc the characterization methods revealed the successful preparation of nzc with a favorable surface area of 103 739 m2 g and unique morphology and functional groups investigating the ability of nzc for adsorbing cipr antibiotics conducted at different conditions showed that 0 3 g of nzc achieved outstanding adsorption for 150 ppm cipr antibiotic from 100 ml solutions at mixing speed of 200 rpm solution ph of 4 6 and solution temperature of 25 30 c estimating the values of h s and g confirmed that the adsorption process of cipr antibiotics by nzc was feasible exothermic and spontaneous the freundlich and pseudo second order models well fitted the adsorption process s experimental data the results of both the kinetic and isotherm studies showed that the adsorption process of cipr antibiotics by nzc is simultaneously composed of physical and chemical adsorption on the heterogeneous adsorption sites in multilayers also the intra particle diffusion was not the controlling step and the external surface adsorption influenced the adsorption of cipr from the abovementioned results nzc is recommended as a highly efficient adsorbent for the removal of cipr loaded effluents graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords zsm 5 zeolite adsorption antibiotics removal fluoroquinolone family ciprofloxacin 1 introduction the survival of all living beings essentially depends on water drinkable water undergoes severe depilation worldwide due to the population growth demanding rapid progress of different industries this fast industrial development leads to massive pollution as a result of increasing the concentration of contaminants released to the ecosystems and spoils the quality of water 1 2 pharmaceuticals including cytostatic drugs anticonvulsants antibiotics and hormones are one of the serious problems of water contamination resulting from the discharge of huge quantities into water systems 3 antibiotics are a part of pharmaceuticals that are highly described and consumed to treat a wide range of bacterial diseases in humans poultry fishes and livestock 4 5 more than 250 antibiotics are recorded for veterinary and human medicine 6 antibiotics as a kind of most commonly used drug in modern life is partially metabolized after digestion and the metabolized and non metabolized portions are excreted out of the living body 7 8 the antibiotics are ingested by human and animals bodies with urine and feces into municipal effluents as a result of inadequate metabolism 9 10 also antibiotics can enter the environment via soils contaminated by animal excretion and manure dispersion 11 about 30 90 of the antibiotic dose taken for a specific treatment is not absorbed and remains un metabolized due to its inhibition property 12 13 therefore antibiotic residues are found in soil groundwater and surface water because of the discharges of domestic agricultural hospitals and industrial effluents 13 wastewaters containing antibiotics likely lead to lethal health risks because of their toxic nature resulting from containing toxic and carcinogenic elements which can cause an indirect impact after a while on ecological sustainability 14 15 also unsafe disposal of antibiotic residues with persistent and long half live elements can potentially alter the microbial ecosystems through exerting particular pressure on the sensitive bacteria leading to the survival of persistent strains and developing antimicrobial resistance as a result commonly used antibiotics or conventional treatments become disabled in curing new different generations of infectious diseases 13 16 fent et al 17 reported the concentration of the pharmaceuticals in the sewage treatment plants stp in many countries ranging of ng l μg l which is quite low concentrations nevertheless the ecotoxicity of pharmaceuticals has been reported at μg l concentration ciprofloxacin 1 cyclopropyl 6 fluoro 1 4 dihydro 4 oxo 7 1 piperazinyl 3 quinoline carboxylic acid like amoxicillin and tetracycline belongs to the fluoroquinolone family and is one of the different types of antibiotics ciprofloxacin is broadly recommended for the efficient treatment of different diseases caused by bacterial infections 4 7 ciprofloxacin has been commonly found in aquatic environments because it is chemically stable due to having fluorine atoms in its chemical formula and it is able for bacteria inhabitation 18 19 therefore ciprofloxacin concentration in wastewater is about 31 mg l which is even higher in wastewater discharge of drug plants and hospitals containing about 150 μg l 18 20 ciprofloxacin is known to be highly water soluble about 1 35 mg ml at different ph conditions and highly stable in wastewater and soil 9 21 consequently it became essential to detect a proper treatment method for antibiotics removal from wastewater discharges before reusing or releasing these waste effluents to the water bodies several treatment methods for antibiotics removal from wastewater were mentioned in choi et al 22 which are electrolysis coagulation biological degradation photocatalysis and adsorption also braschi et al 23 mentioned other techniques e g biological treatment electrical electrochemical treatment photochemical treatment supercritical fluid treatment vacuum treatment and treatment using ultrasounds and microwave moreover advanced oxidation processes namely photocatalytic oxidation tio2 uva o2 photocatalytic ozonation tio2 uva o3 and catalytic ozonation tio2 o3 in dark can mineralize antibiotic molecules completely or even convert them into simple and fewer harm compounds 24 28 various limitations face utilization of these methodologies e g high energy consumption high cost of materials the sophistication of the removal processes for antibiotic elimination and generation of secondary pollution due to adding chemicals 22 also the nature of most of these compounds is polar with modest solubility in water making the comprehensive removal of them is hard 29 therefore a suitable economical treatment technique for the removal of the discharged pharmaceuticals are needed to allow the sustainable use of water 17 using inorganic or organic adsorbents for uptaking of organic pollutants is one of the most efficient methods for treating wastewater 23 the performance of the adsorption process is strongly influenced by the operating conditions adsorbate type and adsorbent type activated carbon multiwall carbon nanotubes metal organic frameworks mofs clay and zeolites have been reported for treating wastewater containing antibiotics by adsorption 6 activated carbon is one of the most effective adsorbents however it has several disadvantages represented by its high cost its sensitivity of pore blocking and the complexity of regeneration 30 since the exhausted sorbents have to be regenerated and reused to avoid additional environmental problems resulting from the disposal of exhausted contaminated materials the regeneration process is strongly affected by the properties of sorbate the nature of sorbent the nature of adsorption and the cost of the regeneration restoring method regeneration is commonly done by thermal treatments in which the adsorbents are subjected to heating to volatilize and or oxidize the adsorbed species 23 therefore all these issues have recently been considered to motivate active research seeking new alternative low cost adsorbents zeolites are feasible alternative adsorbents ion exchangers which are usually used for treating sewage and wastewater 31 zeolites are crystalline aluminosilicates with uniformly sized micropores pore size 10 nm which are orderly distributed within their open porous structure 32 33 zeolite s properties such as acidity thermal stability surface area ion exchange capacity and shape selectivity depend on their si al ratio which in turn allow zeolites to be classified into three classes low si al with si al 2 intermediate si al with 2 si al 5 and high si al ratio with si al 5 34 37 zeolites having low or intermediate si al ratio are hydrophilic and act as outstanding ion exchangers for softening and removal of heavy metals and radioactive elements but not organic contaminants 38 41 while zeolites having a high si al ratio are hydrophobic and act as catalysts adsorbents and molecular sieves for the applications of catalytic conversions gas separation removal of volatile organic compounds air pollution remediation etc 42 therefore zsm 5 zeolite as a hydrophobic adsorbent can be a good choice to study the removal of ciprofloxacin as a model antibiotic from stimulated wastewater however the diffusion problem that arises from the zeolites microporosity can limit their use in this form accordingly constructing hierarchically porous structure zeolites can help in reducing the mass transfer resistance this work presents the preparation of zsm 5 nanosized zeolite carbon composite as an eco friendly adsorbent with improved adsorption capacity for the efficient removal of ciprofloxacin from simulated wastewater this zeolite carbon composite is supposed to own hierarchical porosity which will enhance the adsorption of the antibiotics by improving the diffusion inside the adsorbent s pores characterization of the adsorbents such as surface area porosity surface morphology and active groups was studied during this work the adsorption process was studied at different adsorbent dosages initial adsorbate concentration initial adsorbate solution ph and initial adsorbate solution temperature also the isotherms kinetics and thermodynamics of the adsorption process were investigated 2 materials and

was prepared according to procedures mentioned in 35 in that 0 3 g of sodium aluminate was added to a solution made of 0 15 g naoh 10 g h2o 5 ml ethanol and mixed for 60 min at the same time 5 g of ludox 40 was added slowly to a solution made of 0 15 g naoh 10 g h2o 2 5 ml tpaoh and mixed 1 25 27 59 for 30 min then the alumina contained solution was added to the silica contained solution and mixed for 60 min to form a creamy gel which was aged overnight and crystallized for 72 h at 170 c the recovered powder was calcined in an air atmosphere for 180 min at 550 c to release the organics used in the preparation the zsm 5 zeolite nanocrystals were obtained using a ball mill in a dry mode grinding the grinding container 7 cm 16 cm was made of stainless steel and the grinding media was stainless steel balls of 11 mm diameter the grinding continued for 32 h 2 3 preparation of a porous carbon support almond shells were used to obtain porous support because it is an inexpensive and extensively abundant bio waste locally available in iraq the collected shells were treated exactly according to the steps mentioned in 34 however the clean shells were manually ground and sieved to obtain particles ranging of 2 36 4 5 mm before carbonization then the ground shells were heated to 600 c for 4 h with a constant rate of 10 c min inside a completely sealed stainless steel container with a small hole in the top cover to allow the gases resulting from carbonization to escape and avoid explosion this way of carbonization allows obtaining the porous support at conditions lower than those used in 34 the ground shells were weighed prior to and post heating and then characterized 2 4 preparation of zeolite carbon composite the preparation of zsm 5 zeolite nanocrystals coating carbon involves dispersion of 1 5 g of zsm 5 zeolite nanocrystals in 15 g of h2o for 15 min then 2 g of sucrose was added to the zeolite slurry and mixed for 10 min over a hot plate at 100 c 3 g of carbon was mixed with the zeolite sucrose mixture for 15 min after that 0 5 g of citric acid was mixed with the above mixture for 5 min then the produced slurry was moved to an oven at 100 110 c with continuous mixing the resultant solid particles were carbonized at 600 c for 2 h in an air free atmosphere to obtain the composite the procedures used to prepare the composite was inspired by a previously published work 43 2 5 characterization methods identifying the phase of the synthesized zeolite and composite was conducted using an x ray diffraction xrd xpert pillips holland instrument with a radiation source of cukα with λ 1 5418 å the voltage 30 kv the current 30 ma a scan speed 3 min a step size 0 03 and 2θ 5 80 the morphology of the adsorbents was studied by characterization of the adsorbent s surface by field emission scanning electron microscope fesem performed by a model tescan mira3 french also the same instrument was used for characterization by energy dispersive analysis by x ray edax to obtain a quantitative analysis of the adsorbents the average crystal size was performed for the zsm 5 zeolite using imagej software depending on fesem images the functional groups present on the adsorbent s surface were identified by fourier transform infrared ftir model shimadzu iraffinity 1 spectrophotometer depending on the ftir spectrum also the composite was characterized by tga using a model perkin elmer to obtain the weight of zeolite actually present in the composite this characterization was performed by heating the sample to 900 c in an air atmosphere at a rate of 10 c min the specific surface area of the adsorbents was measured by the brunauer emmett teller bet method based on the nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms obtained using a micromeritics tristar ii plus surface area and porosity analyzer version 2 03 2 6 adsorption experiments the classical approach of adsorption in a batch mode was used to study the effects of shaking time adsorbent weight initial cipr concentration solution ph and solution temperature on the cipr removal efficiency all adsorption experiments were carried out in 125 ml glass vials at a constant cipr solution volume of 100 ml and a constant shaking speed of 150 rpm using a digital incubator shaker however the studied parameters are presented in table 1 the stock solution of cipr was initially prepared with 500 ppm whereas the other cipr concentrations were prepared by diluting the stock solution with adequate volumes of distilled water depending on the variable to be studied the predetermined adsorbent weight was shaken in a vial containing cipr solution for the designated shaking time the samples were taken at designated intervals to be analyzed for their remaining cipr concentration at a wavelength of 276 nm the analysis was performed and repeated three times using a uv vis spectrophotometer model uv 9200 biotech engineering management all the samples were filtered by filter papers whatman 0 45 μm to separate the adsorbent from the liquid to study the effect of solution ph on the removal efficiency the adjustment of the initial ph of cipr solutions was carried out using hcl and naoh and the measurement of ph was made by a ph meter studying the kinetics and the related thermodynamic parameters was carried out depending on the results of studying the effect of temperatures at the same time the results of different adsorbent weights were used to study the adsorption isotherms the cipr removal efficiency removal and the equilibrium adsorption capacity qe

cipr solution l co and ce are the initial and remaining concentrations of cipr in solutions mg l when ct mg l is applied in eq 2 the adsorption capacity qt mg g can be determined at a designated time during the experiment the total number of samples that were relied on presenting the results was 110 2 7 determination of the point of zero charge phpzc determination of the point of zero charge phpzc of the adsorbent was conducted using the classical method mentioned in 46 the procedures involved adjusting the ph of 100 ml of 0 1 m nacl in a range of 2 12 using 1 m hcl or naoh solutions then 1 g of adsorbent was added to the prepared nacl solutions and shaken for 24 h the final ph of the solution was read after filtration of the adsorbent the zero charge value represents the intersection of the curve plotted from the difference between the final ph and initial ph of a solution against the initial ph this test was conducted for the composite to understand its behavior during the adsorption of antibiotics 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the adsorbents combining zeolite with a porous carbon using friendly environment binding components previously proved its efficiency in the synthesis of low cost ion exchange composite 43 the method used in this work was inspired by that work to obtain a cost effective adsorbent for antibiotics removal studying the characterization of carbon cs zsm 5 nanosized zeolite nz and zsm 5 nanosized zeolite carbon composite nzc can help in elucidating the adsorption process of antibiotics fig 1 a shows appearing of peaks relevant to zsm 5 zeolite in the xrd pattern at 7 94 101 8 9 020 23 18 501 23 96 303 and 24 47 133 according to the tga results shown in fig 1 b the percentage of zeolite present within the prepared composite represents 26 20 of the total composite weight therefore zsm 5 appeared with only the characterizing peaks within the amorphous pattern of the carbon support the ftir spectra of the composite are shown in fig 1 c also the functional groups referring to the presence of zsm 5 within the composite texture appeared at 3746 62 3709 45 3687 22 3671 72 3647 50 3613 33 3585 87 3564 55 3443 451083 40 and 830 cm 1 symbolized by in the ftir spectrum the band of peaks that appeared at 1700 3700 cm 1 refers to the stretching vibrations of the silanol groups and molecular water oh groups si oh si oh al and oh hydroxyl groups a peak that appeared at 1083 40 cm 1 is assigned to the internal tetrahedron vibrations of si o al and si o si also a peak that appeared at 830 cm 1 is assigned to the sio stretching vibration the other peaks symbolized by red in the ftir spectra appearing at 2851 67 cm 1 refers to the symmetric starching vibration of ch2 groups 2918 93 cm 1 refers to the asymmetric stretching vibration of ch 2379 67 cm 1 refers to ch symmetric stretching frequency 1383 85 cm 1 refers to no stretching vibration of aromatics and 1612 92 cm 1 refers to occurring of co carbonyl groups in ketones and carboxylic acids fig 1 d shows the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms of cs nz and nzc the results shown in this figure indicated producing microporous nz due to obtaining isotherm type i while cs showed a kind of iv isotherm which refers to the presence of mesoporous structure which can be attributed to the random form pores resulting from the carbonization of the biomass waste nzc showed an obvious iv isotherm which refers to the presence of mesoporous structure also table 2 presents the surface area using the bet method sbet and the pore volume of cs nz and nzc they were 64 976 m2 g and 0 001204 cm3 g for cs 91 127 m2 g and 0 092913 cm3 g for nz and 103 739 m2 g and 0 009490 cm3 g for nzc these results imply that cs has an acceptable surface area which perhaps participates in the adsorption process combining zsm 5 nanosized zeolite with carbon support in the composite gave a higher surface area than both individually also coating the carbon support with zsm 5 nanosized zeolite resulted in a composite with a moderated pore volume the images present in fig 2 show the morphology of cs nz and nzc first of all the produced cs represented 24 47 of the total mass entered the carbonization process this percentage was 2 lower than produced in the previous work when carbonization was conducted in the presence of nitrogen atmosphere at 800 c 39 this result indicates producing porous support with higher surface area and porosity due to removing more components during the carbonization at an isolated reactor producing carbon support with a porous surface and a particle size of 923 4 nm can explain the acceptable surface area that is obtained while nz appeared as clusters of spherical crystals with 22 18 nm as presented in table 2 outstandingly nzc showed fully coverage of carbon with zeolite nanocrystals which is considered the target of using the current method of preparation the compositional analysis of cs nz and nzc according to edx analysis is shown in table 2 the elements forming zeolite structure which are si and al appeared within the composition of the composite 3 2 adsorption of cipr 3 2 1 efficiency of adsorbents as the main aim of this work is to create an effective zeolite composite for cipr removal from water the adsorption was applied on cs nz and nzc to see if the prepared carbon participated in the adsorption process when it was used as a support in the prepared composite fig 3 a shows that cs gave higher removal than the obtained by nz by about 15 which is surprising because cs was not activated the good performance of cs is perhaps attributed to its acceptable surface area containing organophilic groups such as ch ch2 and co groups also the figure shows that removal increased sharply from just above 12 to just below 70 when shaking time increased from 10 to 20 min then removal gradually increased with time until it took a quite same level at 180 min and then level out the removal of cipr by nz gradually increased with time starting from about 54 to about 76 at 180 min then the increase was inconsiderable while nzc showed the highest removal of cipr since it started with about 70 and raised during the first 30 min to just above 85 and continued with a slight increase to just above 90 at 180 min and stabilized for the next 2 h although nzc contained only 26 20 of nz it kept the same manner of nz in the removal of cipr with a higher removal which is perhaps attributed to enhancing the diffusion of cipr resulting from spreading it over cs the enhancement of cipr diffusion inside the micropores of nz crystals coated over cs is attributed to diminishing the resistance of mass transfer of cipr and thus permitting the uptake of cipr over the adsorption sites 3 2 2 adsorption dose the results of changing the nzc weight on the removal of 100 ppm cipr from 100 ml solution are shown in fig 3 b the results show that the removal of cipr went up with increasing the weight of nzc from 0 1 to 0 3 g then unexpectedly the removal of cipr plummeted with increasing the weight of nzc further to 0 4 and 0 5 g since using both 0 4 and 0 5 g gave marginally the same removal of cipr this result can be explained as that nzc weight in the range of 0 1 0 3 g is adequate for the removal of cipr with a concentration of 100 ppm from a solution with a volume of 100 ml consequently the extra mass of nzc may accumulate and penetration of this mass to reach the adsorption sites becomes hard moreover the removal of cipr for all used weights of nzc stabilized with a further increase in the shaking time above 180 min which indicates that the adsorption reached the equilibrium time 3 2 3 initial cipr concentration the effect of initial cipr concentrations on the removal of cipr from 100 ml solution using 0 3 g of nzc is shown through the results obtained at equilibrium time and presented in fig 3 c according to these results the removal of cipr dropped with increasing the initial cipr concentration this trend is predictable because of using the same nzc weight per 100 ml for all different concentrations this fixed mass provided the same numbers of active sites which were saturated by a certain amount of the adsorbate 3 2 4 cipr solution ph the ph of the adsorbate solution is an important parameter influencing the adsorption process because it influences both the speciation of the adsorbate and the adsorbent surface charge 29 depending on the ph of the adsorbate solution the charge of the adsorbent surface can alter because protonation or deprotonation of the functional groups present on the adsorbent s surface can occur 7 the charges on the adsorbent surface are in equilibrium when the ph solution reached a value called phpzc the adsorbent surface can be negatively charged when the solution ph is below phpzc however the adsorbent surface can be positively charged when the ph of a solution is above phpzc 29 the electrostatic mechanism of the adsorption process extraordinarily depends on the adsorbate solution ph whilst if other mechanisms of adsorption occur the ph of the adsorbate solution becomes less important 7 the effect of changing the cipr solution ph on the removal of 100 ppm cipr from 100 ml solution using 0 3 g of nzc is shown through the results obtained at equilibrium time and presented in fig 3 d the removal of cipr gradually increased from 81 to about 91 with rising the solution ph from 2 to 6 then it dramatically declined to about 63 when the ph increased to 12 the higher removal of cipr was found in the range of 4 6 these results can be explained based on the results of phpzc shown in fig 4 the phpzc of the nzc was 8 1 when the solution ph is above this value the nzc surface is charged with negative due to the coverage with negative charges of oh i e cation adsorption is favored while the nzc surface is charged with positive due to the coverage with positive charges of h when the solution ph is below 8 1 i e the anion adsorption is favored also this figure shows that nzc is highly charged with a positive charge at ph in the range of 4 6 which elucidates the high removal of cipr at the aforementioned range at cipr solution ph of 4 6 cipr molecules become negative due to the protonation of amine groups and thus the attraction force increased between the nzc particles and cipr molecules the removal of cipr became less than 80 when the solution ph value was above 8 because the cipr molecule lost the protons from the carboxyl groups in its structure and converted them to anions the repulsion force increased between the nzc particles and cipr molecules because both have similar charges resulting in lower removal of cipr in this case nzc represents a cost effective eco friendly adsorbent of cipr from pharmaceutical wastewater because most of these kinds of wastewaters are within or near neutral 3 2 5 cipr solution temperature kinetics and thermodynamic studies the effect of cipr solution temperature on the uptake of cipr using nzc is explained through the results presented in fig 5 a the results show that the removal of cipr using nzc ranged between 86 5 and 92 in the range of cipr solution temperature of 25 40 c the maximum removal of 92 was achieved at 30 c and a small drop in the removal of cipr occurred at 40 c this ineffective difference in the removal of cipr antibiotic by nzc in the temperature range of 25 40 c demonstrated that nzc is an efficient adsorbent for removal of cipr at the aforementioned range of temperature and the adsorption process was exothermic eze et al 12 pointed out that increasing the temperature of a solution containing ciprofloxacin in the range of 27 50 c caused a 10 reduction in the removal percentage of ciprofloxacin using acid modified dialium guineense tamarind seeds mohammed et al 4 used pistachio shell powder coated with zinc oxide nanoparticles to adsorb amoxicillin ciprofloxacin and tetracycline from water simultaneously and noticed a reduction in the removal percentage of ciprofloxacin when the temperature increased from 25 to 35 c mohseni bandpi et al 14 reported a decrease in the adsorption capacity of magnetic fe3o4 nanoparticles used to remove cephalexin from water when the temperature increased from 10 to 30 c mohammed et al 3 found that raising the temperature of a solution containing tetracycline to 30 c and above reduced the removal efficiency in the presence of pistachio shell coated with zno nanoparticles as an adsorbent however more study is required to perceive the kinetics of the adsorption process at different temperatures as well as the thermodynamic parameters are required to understand the nature of the adsorption process by nzc the mechanism and characteristics of adsorption can be explained by studying the adsorption kinetic models the linearized equations used in the kinetic and thermodynamic studies are shown in table 3 the kinetics of adsorption of cipr by nzc were studied via pseudo first order model given by eq 3 pseudo second order model given by eq 4 and the intra particle diffusion model given by eq 5 the results are presented in fig 5 b d and table 4 the results show that the pseudo second order model successfully fitted the experimental data of cipr uptake with r2 of 0 997 1 according to this model the experimental adsorption capacity at different selected solution temperatures was close to the predicted equilibrium adsorption capacity therefore the pseudo second order model is better than the pseudo first order model in representing the adsorption data which means that the adsorption of cipr by nzc is a chemisorption process the results obtained by the intra particle diffusion model are shown in fig 5 d and table 4 the plot of equilibrium adsorption capacity against the second root of time did not fit the linear equation and it took multi stages it indicates the adsorption process of cipr on nzc occurred in three mechanisms of adsorption adsorption on an external surface intra particle pore diffusion and adsorption on the internal sites in which the intra particle diffusion is not the controlling mechanism since the plots did not pass the origin point it means that the external surface adsorption influences the adsorption of cipr from the solution also the results presented in the table show that increasing the solution temperature to 30 c reduced the value of cip from 24 731 to 20 893 mg g indicating a reduction in the resistance caused by the thickness of the exterior liquid film however further increases in the solution temperature to 35 and 40 c resulted in less reduction in the value of cip accompanied by increasing the value of ki increasing the value of ki refers to enhancing the diffusivity of the adsorbate molecules by increasing the solution temperature therefore reducing the removal of cipr using nzc with increasing the solution temperature above 30 c is attributed to the possibility of desorbing some adsorbed antibiotic molecules due to weakening the attraction force between the adsorbate and adsorbent surface determination of the thermodynamic parameters was conducted using eq 6 eq 7 and eq 8 the results of the thermodynamic study represented by the van t hoff curve are shown in fig 5 e and the values of s h kd and g are presented in table 5 the negative values of g presented in table 5 identified the adsorption of cipr by nzc is spontaneous also increasing the solution temperature resulted in a very small decrease in the negative values of g indicating a slight reduction in the spontaneity of the process also the negative value of s refers to reducing the randomness on the adsorbent solution interface moreover the negative value of h refers to that the adsorption of cipr by nzc is exothermic 3 2 6 adsorption isotherms the equilibrium adsorption isotherms were studied using the linear form of the four well known isotherm models namely the langmuir isotherm model given by eq 9 the freundlich isotherm model given by eq 10 dubinin radushkevitch d r isotherm model given by eq 11 eq 12 and eq 13 and temkin isotherm model given by eq 14 and eq 15 the model s curves are shown in fig 6 and the model s constants are presented in table 6 the results show that the freundlich isotherm model is suitable to represent the experimental results with a value of r2 0 992 higher than of the other models and the value of 1 n was 0 805 these results indicate the multilayer adsorption of cipr onto heterogeneous adsorption sites on the nzc also the experimental results fitted to the langmuir isotherm model with a maximum adsorption capacity of 87 719 mg g and r2 of 0 974 which indicates occurring of favorable and physical adsorption however the value of the temkin model constant bt which was found to be 184 kj mol i e 80 kj mol indicates occurring of chemical adsorption d r isotherm model represented the experimental data with a fairly acceptable r2 value of 0 863 however it confirmed the physical nature of cipr adsorption by nzc due to the e value being 0 707 kj mol i e 8 kj mol based on the comprehensive findings of the kinetic and isotherm studies it can be concluded that the adsorption process of cipr by nzc combined both chemisorption and physisorption a comparison can be made among the outcomes of maximum capacity obtained in the current study and those obtained by previous work published in the last two years is shown in table 7 nzc showed acceptable adsorption capacity despite the variation of surface characteristics of the used adsorbents and the concentrations of cipr chosen for each study eventually it can be considered that nzc is an efficient adsorbent that can be recommended for the removal of cipr antibiotics from wastewater 4 conclusions the removal of ciprofloxacin cipr antibiotics from the water was studied in the adsorption process using zsm 5 nanocrystals carbon composites nzc fabrication of nzc was carried out using environment friendly adhesive made of sucrose citric acid followed by carbonization to obtain a solid final product the results of characterization proved the feasibility of assembling zsm 5 nanocrystals and carbon at moderate conditions without the need for hydrothermal treatment also the prepared composite showed favorable ability to adsorb cipr antibiotics from solutions at different conditions it was found that the higher removal efficiency was obtained for 100 ppm of cipr antibiotic from 100 ml solutions using 0 3 g of nzc at a solution ph of 4 6 and a solution temperature of 25 30 c good matching of the experimental data to the freundlich model and pseudo second order indicated that the adsorption process of cipr antibiotics by nzc combined the physical and chemical adsorption on heterogeneous adsorption sites in multilayers the study of the intra particle diffusion model confirmed that the adsorption on the external surface affected the adsorption of cipr antibiotics using nzc and the intra particle diffusion is not the determining step the thermodynamic study proved that the adsorption process of cipr antibiotics by nzc was feasible exothermic and spontaneous therefore nzc is efficiently endorsed for the adsorption process to remove cipr antibiotics from wastewater declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
13061,the presence of antibiotic residues such as ciprofloxacin cipr in an aqueous environment is dangerous when their concentrations exceed the allowable therefore eliminating these residues from the wastewater becomes an essential issue to prevent their harm in this work the potential of efficient adsorption of ciprofloxacin antibiotics was studied using eco friendly zsm 5 nanocrystals carbon composite nzc an inexpensive effective natural binder made of the sucrose citric acid mixture was used for preparing nzc the characterization methods revealed the successful preparation of nzc with a favorable surface area of 103 739 m2 g and unique morphology and functional groups investigating the ability of nzc for adsorbing cipr antibiotics conducted at different conditions showed that 0 3 g of nzc achieved outstanding adsorption for 150 ppm cipr antibiotic from 100 ml solutions at mixing speed of 200 rpm solution ph of 4 6 and solution temperature of 25 30 c estimating the values of h s and g confirmed that the adsorption process of cipr antibiotics by nzc was feasible exothermic and spontaneous the freundlich and pseudo second order models well fitted the adsorption process s experimental data the results of both the kinetic and isotherm studies showed that the adsorption process of cipr antibiotics by nzc is simultaneously composed of physical and chemical adsorption on the heterogeneous adsorption sites in multilayers also the intra particle diffusion was not the controlling step and the external surface adsorption influenced the adsorption of cipr from the abovementioned results nzc is recommended as a highly efficient adsorbent for the removal of cipr loaded effluents graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords zsm 5 zeolite adsorption antibiotics removal fluoroquinolone family ciprofloxacin 1 introduction the survival of all living beings essentially depends on water drinkable water undergoes severe depilation worldwide due to the population growth demanding rapid progress of different industries this fast industrial development leads to massive pollution as a result of increasing the concentration of contaminants released to the ecosystems and spoils the quality of water 1 2 pharmaceuticals including cytostatic drugs anticonvulsants antibiotics and hormones are one of the serious problems of water contamination resulting from the discharge of huge quantities into water systems 3 antibiotics are a part of pharmaceuticals that are highly described and consumed to treat a wide range of bacterial diseases in humans poultry fishes and livestock 4 5 more than 250 antibiotics are recorded for veterinary and human medicine 6 antibiotics as a kind of most commonly used drug in modern life is partially metabolized after digestion and the metabolized and non metabolized portions are excreted out of the living body 7 8 the antibiotics are ingested by human and animals bodies with urine and feces into municipal effluents as a result of inadequate metabolism 9 10 also antibiotics can enter the environment via soils contaminated by animal excretion and manure dispersion 11 about 30 90 of the antibiotic dose taken for a specific treatment is not absorbed and remains un metabolized due to its inhibition property 12 13 therefore antibiotic residues are found in soil groundwater and surface water because of the discharges of domestic agricultural hospitals and industrial effluents 13 wastewaters containing antibiotics likely lead to lethal health risks because of their toxic nature resulting from containing toxic and carcinogenic elements which can cause an indirect impact after a while on ecological sustainability 14 15 also unsafe disposal of antibiotic residues with persistent and long half live elements can potentially alter the microbial ecosystems through exerting particular pressure on the sensitive bacteria leading to the survival of persistent strains and developing antimicrobial resistance as a result commonly used antibiotics or conventional treatments become disabled in curing new different generations of infectious diseases 13 16 fent et al 17 reported the concentration of the pharmaceuticals in the sewage treatment plants stp in many countries ranging of ng l μg l which is quite low concentrations nevertheless the ecotoxicity of pharmaceuticals has been reported at μg l concentration ciprofloxacin 1 cyclopropyl 6 fluoro 1 4 dihydro 4 oxo 7 1 piperazinyl 3 quinoline carboxylic acid like amoxicillin and tetracycline belongs to the fluoroquinolone family and is one of the different types of antibiotics ciprofloxacin is broadly recommended for the efficient treatment of different diseases caused by bacterial infections 4 7 ciprofloxacin has been commonly found in aquatic environments because it is chemically stable due to having fluorine atoms in its chemical formula and it is able for bacteria inhabitation 18 19 therefore ciprofloxacin concentration in wastewater is about 31 mg l which is even higher in wastewater discharge of drug plants and hospitals containing about 150 μg l 18 20 ciprofloxacin is known to be highly water soluble about 1 35 mg ml at different ph conditions and highly stable in wastewater and soil 9 21 consequently it became essential to detect a proper treatment method for antibiotics removal from wastewater discharges before reusing or releasing these waste effluents to the water bodies several treatment methods for antibiotics removal from wastewater were mentioned in choi et al 22 which are electrolysis coagulation biological degradation photocatalysis and adsorption also braschi et al 23 mentioned other techniques e g biological treatment electrical electrochemical treatment photochemical treatment supercritical fluid treatment vacuum treatment and treatment using ultrasounds and microwave moreover advanced oxidation processes namely photocatalytic oxidation tio2 uva o2 photocatalytic ozonation tio2 uva o3 and catalytic ozonation tio2 o3 in dark can mineralize antibiotic molecules completely or even convert them into simple and fewer harm compounds 24 28 various limitations face utilization of these methodologies e g high energy consumption high cost of materials the sophistication of the removal processes for antibiotic elimination and generation of secondary pollution due to adding chemicals 22 also the nature of most of these compounds is polar with modest solubility in water making the comprehensive removal of them is hard 29 therefore a suitable economical treatment technique for the removal of the discharged pharmaceuticals are needed to allow the sustainable use of water 17 using inorganic or organic adsorbents for uptaking of organic pollutants is one of the most efficient methods for treating wastewater 23 the performance of the adsorption process is strongly influenced by the operating conditions adsorbate type and adsorbent type activated carbon multiwall carbon nanotubes metal organic frameworks mofs clay and zeolites have been reported for treating wastewater containing antibiotics by adsorption 6 activated carbon is one of the most effective adsorbents however it has several disadvantages represented by its high cost its sensitivity of pore blocking and the complexity of regeneration 30 since the exhausted sorbents have to be regenerated and reused to avoid additional environmental problems resulting from the disposal of exhausted contaminated materials the regeneration process is strongly affected by the properties of sorbate the nature of sorbent the nature of adsorption and the cost of the regeneration restoring method regeneration is commonly done by thermal treatments in which the adsorbents are subjected to heating to volatilize and or oxidize the adsorbed species 23 therefore all these issues have recently been considered to motivate active research seeking new alternative low cost adsorbents zeolites are feasible alternative adsorbents ion exchangers which are usually used for treating sewage and wastewater 31 zeolites are crystalline aluminosilicates with uniformly sized micropores pore size 10 nm which are orderly distributed within their open porous structure 32 33 zeolite s properties such as acidity thermal stability surface area ion exchange capacity and shape selectivity depend on their si al ratio which in turn allow zeolites to be classified into three classes low si al with si al 2 intermediate si al with 2 si al 5 and high si al ratio with si al 5 34 37 zeolites having low or intermediate si al ratio are hydrophilic and act as outstanding ion exchangers for softening and removal of heavy metals and radioactive elements but not organic contaminants 38 41 while zeolites having a high si al ratio are hydrophobic and act as catalysts adsorbents and molecular sieves for the applications of catalytic conversions gas separation removal of volatile organic compounds air pollution remediation etc 42 therefore zsm 5 zeolite as a hydrophobic adsorbent can be a good choice to study the removal of ciprofloxacin as a model antibiotic from stimulated wastewater however the diffusion problem that arises from the zeolites microporosity can limit their use in this form accordingly constructing hierarchically porous structure zeolites can help in reducing the mass transfer resistance this work presents the preparation of zsm 5 nanosized zeolite carbon composite as an eco friendly adsorbent with improved adsorption capacity for the efficient removal of ciprofloxacin from simulated wastewater this zeolite carbon composite is supposed to own hierarchical porosity which will enhance the adsorption of the antibiotics by improving the diffusion inside the adsorbent s pores characterization of the adsorbents such as surface area porosity surface morphology and active groups was studied during this work the adsorption process was studied at different adsorbent dosages initial adsorbate concentration initial adsorbate solution ph and initial adsorbate solution temperature also the isotherms kinetics and thermodynamics of the adsorption process were investigated 2 materials and

was prepared according to procedures mentioned in 35 in that 0 3 g of sodium aluminate was added to a solution made of 0 15 g naoh 10 g h2o 5 ml ethanol and mixed for 60 min at the same time 5 g of ludox 40 was added slowly to a solution made of 0 15 g naoh 10 g h2o 2 5 ml tpaoh and mixed 1 25 27 59 for 30 min then the alumina contained solution was added to the silica contained solution and mixed for 60 min to form a creamy gel which was aged overnight and crystallized for 72 h at 170 c the recovered powder was calcined in an air atmosphere for 180 min at 550 c to release the organics used in the preparation the zsm 5 zeolite nanocrystals were obtained using a ball mill in a dry mode grinding the grinding container 7 cm 16 cm was made of stainless steel and the grinding media was stainless steel balls of 11 mm diameter the grinding continued for 32 h 2 3 preparation of a porous carbon support almond shells were used to obtain porous support because it is an inexpensive and extensively abundant bio waste locally available in iraq the collected shells were treated exactly according to the steps mentioned in 34 however the clean shells were manually ground and sieved to obtain particles ranging of 2 36 4 5 mm before carbonization then the ground shells were heated to 600 c for 4 h with a constant rate of 10 c min inside a completely sealed stainless steel container with a small hole in the top cover to allow the gases resulting from carbonization to escape and avoid explosion this way of carbonization allows obtaining the porous support at conditions lower than those used in 34 the ground shells were weighed prior to and post heating and then characterized 2 4 preparation of zeolite carbon composite the preparation of zsm 5 zeolite nanocrystals coating carbon involves dispersion of 1 5 g of zsm 5 zeolite nanocrystals in 15 g of h2o for 15 min then 2 g of sucrose was added to the zeolite slurry and mixed for 10 min over a hot plate at 100 c 3 g of carbon was mixed with the zeolite sucrose mixture for 15 min after that 0 5 g of citric acid was mixed with the above mixture for 5 min then the produced slurry was moved to an oven at 100 110 c with continuous mixing the resultant solid particles were carbonized at 600 c for 2 h in an air free atmosphere to obtain the composite the procedures used to prepare the composite was inspired by a previously published work 43 2 5 characterization methods identifying the phase of the synthesized zeolite and composite was conducted using an x ray diffraction xrd xpert pillips holland instrument with a radiation source of cukα with λ 1 5418 å the voltage 30 kv the current 30 ma a scan speed 3 min a step size 0 03 and 2θ 5 80 the morphology of the adsorbents was studied by characterization of the adsorbent s surface by field emission scanning electron microscope fesem performed by a model tescan mira3 french also the same instrument was used for characterization by energy dispersive analysis by x ray edax to obtain a quantitative analysis of the adsorbents the average crystal size was performed for the zsm 5 zeolite using imagej software depending on fesem images the functional groups present on the adsorbent s surface were identified by fourier transform infrared ftir model shimadzu iraffinity 1 spectrophotometer depending on the ftir spectrum also the composite was characterized by tga using a model perkin elmer to obtain the weight of zeolite actually present in the composite this characterization was performed by heating the sample to 900 c in an air atmosphere at a rate of 10 c min the specific surface area of the adsorbents was measured by the brunauer emmett teller bet method based on the nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms obtained using a micromeritics tristar ii plus surface area and porosity analyzer version 2 03 2 6 adsorption experiments the classical approach of adsorption in a batch mode was used to study the effects of shaking time adsorbent weight initial cipr concentration solution ph and solution temperature on the cipr removal efficiency all adsorption experiments were carried out in 125 ml glass vials at a constant cipr solution volume of 100 ml and a constant shaking speed of 150 rpm using a digital incubator shaker however the studied parameters are presented in table 1 the stock solution of cipr was initially prepared with 500 ppm whereas the other cipr concentrations were prepared by diluting the stock solution with adequate volumes of distilled water depending on the variable to be studied the predetermined adsorbent weight was shaken in a vial containing cipr solution for the designated shaking time the samples were taken at designated intervals to be analyzed for their remaining cipr concentration at a wavelength of 276 nm the analysis was performed and repeated three times using a uv vis spectrophotometer model uv 9200 biotech engineering management all the samples were filtered by filter papers whatman 0 45 μm to separate the adsorbent from the liquid to study the effect of solution ph on the removal efficiency the adjustment of the initial ph of cipr solutions was carried out using hcl and naoh and the measurement of ph was made by a ph meter studying the kinetics and the related thermodynamic parameters was carried out depending on the results of studying the effect of temperatures at the same time the results of different adsorbent weights were used to study the adsorption isotherms the cipr removal efficiency removal and the equilibrium adsorption capacity qe

during the experiment the total number of samples that were relied on presenting the results was 110 2 7 determination of the point of zero charge phpzc determination of the point of zero charge phpzc of the adsorbent was conducted using the classical method mentioned in 46 the procedures involved adjusting the ph of 100 ml of 0 1 m nacl in a range of 2 12 using 1 m hcl or naoh solutions then 1 g of adsorbent was added to the prepared nacl solutions and shaken for 24 h the final ph of the solution was read after filtration of the adsorbent the zero charge value represents the intersection of the curve plotted from the difference between the final ph and initial ph of a solution against the initial ph this test was conducted for the composite to understand its behavior during the adsorption of antibiotics 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the adsorbents combining zeolite with a porous carbon using friendly environment binding components previously proved its efficiency in the synthesis of low cost ion exchange composite 43 the method used in this work was inspired by that work to obtain a cost effective adsorbent for antibiotics removal studying the characterization of carbon cs zsm 5 nanosized zeolite nz and zsm 5 nanosized zeolite carbon composite nzc can help in elucidating the adsorption process of antibiotics fig 1 a shows appearing of peaks relevant to zsm 5 zeolite in the xrd pattern at 7 94 101 8 9 020 23 18 501 23 96 303 and 24 47 133 according to the tga results shown in fig 1 b the percentage of zeolite present within the prepared composite represents 26 20 of the total composite weight therefore zsm 5 appeared with only the characterizing peaks within the amorphous pattern of the carbon support the ftir spectra of the composite are shown in fig 1 c also the functional groups referring to the presence of zsm 5 within the composite texture appeared at 3746 62 3709 45 3687 22 3671 72 3647 50 3613 33 3585 87 3564 55 3443 451083 40 and 830 cm 1 symbolized by in the ftir spectrum the band of peaks that appeared at 1700 3700 cm 1 refers to the stretching vibrations of the silanol groups and molecular water oh groups si oh si oh al and oh hydroxyl groups a peak that appeared at 1083 40 cm 1 is assigned to the internal tetrahedron vibrations of si o al and si o si also a peak that appeared at 830 cm 1 is assigned to the sio stretching vibration the other peaks symbolized by red in the ftir spectra appearing at 2851 67 cm 1 refers to the symmetric starching vibration of ch2 groups 2918 93 cm 1 refers to the asymmetric stretching vibration of ch 2379 67 cm 1 refers to ch symmetric stretching frequency 1383 85 cm 1 refers to no stretching vibration of aromatics and 1612 92 cm 1 refers to occurring of co carbonyl groups in ketones and carboxylic acids fig 1 d shows the n2 adsorption desorption isotherms of cs nz and nzc the results shown in this figure indicated producing microporous nz due to obtaining isotherm type i while cs showed a kind of iv isotherm which refers to the presence of mesoporous structure which can be attributed to the random form pores resulting from the carbonization of the biomass waste nzc showed an obvious iv isotherm which refers to the presence of mesoporous structure also table 2 presents the surface area using the bet method sbet and the pore volume of cs nz and nzc they were 64 976 m2 g and 0 001204 cm3 g for cs 91 127 m2 g and 0 092913 cm3 g for nz and 103 739 m2 g and 0 009490 cm3 g for nzc these results imply that cs has an acceptable surface area which perhaps participates in the adsorption process combining zsm 5 nanosized zeolite with carbon support in the composite gave a higher surface area than both individually also coating the carbon support with zsm 5 nanosized zeolite resulted in a composite with a moderated pore volume the images present in fig 2 show the morphology of cs nz and nzc first of all the produced cs represented 24 47 of the total mass entered the carbonization process this percentage was 2 lower than produced in the previous work when carbonization was conducted in the presence of nitrogen atmosphere at 800 c 39 this result indicates producing porous support with higher surface area and porosity due to removing more components during the carbonization at an isolated reactor producing carbon support with a porous surface and a particle size of 923 4 nm can explain the acceptable surface area that is obtained while nz appeared as clusters of spherical crystals with 22 18 nm as presented in table 2 outstandingly nzc showed fully coverage of carbon with zeolite nanocrystals which is considered the target of using the current method of preparation the compositional analysis of cs nz and nzc according to edx analysis is shown in table 2 the elements forming zeolite structure which are si and al appeared within the composition of the composite 3 2 adsorption of cipr 3 2 1 efficiency of adsorbents as the main aim of this work is to create an effective zeolite composite for cipr removal from water the adsorption was applied on cs nz and nzc to see if the prepared carbon participated in the adsorption process when it was used as a support in the prepared composite fig 3 a shows that cs gave higher removal than the obtained by nz by about 15 which is surprising because cs was not activated the good performance of cs is perhaps attributed to its acceptable surface area containing organophilic groups such as ch ch2 and co groups also the figure shows that removal increased sharply from just above 12 to just below 70 when shaking time increased from 10 to 20 min then removal gradually increased with time until it took a quite same level at 180 min and then level out the removal of cipr by nz gradually increased with time starting from about 54 to about 76 at 180 min then the increase was inconsiderable while nzc showed the highest removal of cipr since it started with about 70 and raised during the first 30 min to just above 85 and continued with a slight increase to just above 90 at 180 min and stabilized for the next 2 h although nzc contained only 26 20 of nz it kept the same manner of nz in the removal of cipr with a higher removal which is perhaps attributed to enhancing the diffusion of cipr resulting from spreading it over cs the enhancement of cipr diffusion inside the micropores of nz crystals coated over cs is attributed to diminishing the resistance of mass transfer of cipr and thus permitting the uptake of cipr over the adsorption sites 3 2 2 adsorption dose the results of changing the nzc weight on the removal of 100 ppm cipr from 100 ml solution are shown in fig 3 b the results show that the removal of cipr went up with increasing the weight of nzc from 0 1 to 0 3 g then unexpectedly the removal of cipr plummeted with increasing the weight of nzc further to 0 4 and 0 5 g since using both 0 4 and 0 5 g gave marginally the same removal of cipr this result can be explained as that nzc weight in the range of 0 1 0 3 g is adequate for the removal of cipr with a concentration of 100 ppm from a solution with a volume of 100 ml consequently the extra mass of nzc may accumulate and penetration of this mass to reach the adsorption sites becomes hard moreover the removal of cipr for all used weights of nzc stabilized with a further increase in the shaking time above 180 min which indicates that the adsorption reached the equilibrium time 3 2 3 initial cipr concentration the effect of initial cipr concentrations on the removal of cipr from 100 ml solution using 0 3 g of nzc is shown through the results obtained at equilibrium time and presented in fig 3 c according to these results the removal of cipr dropped with increasing the initial cipr concentration this trend is predictable because of using the same nzc weight per 100 ml for all different concentrations this fixed mass provided the same numbers of active sites which were saturated by a certain amount of the adsorbate 3 2 4 cipr solution ph the ph of the adsorbate solution is an important parameter influencing the adsorption process because it influences both the speciation of the adsorbate and the adsorbent surface charge 29 depending on the ph of the adsorbate solution the charge of the adsorbent surface can alter because protonation or deprotonation of the functional groups present on the adsorbent s surface can occur 7 the charges on the adsorbent surface are in equilibrium when the ph solution reached a value called phpzc the adsorbent surface can be negatively charged when the solution ph is below phpzc however the adsorbent surface can be positively charged when the ph of a solution is above phpzc 29 the electrostatic mechanism of the adsorption process extraordinarily depends on the adsorbate solution ph whilst if other mechanisms of adsorption occur the ph of the adsorbate solution becomes less important 7 the effect of changing the cipr solution ph on the removal of 100 ppm cipr from 100 ml solution using 0 3 g of nzc is shown through the results obtained at equilibrium time and presented in fig 3 d the removal of cipr gradually increased from 81 to about 91 with rising the solution ph from 2 to 6 then it dramatically declined to about 63 when the ph increased to 12 the higher removal of cipr was found in the range of 4 6 these results can be explained based on the results of phpzc shown in fig 4 the phpzc of the nzc was 8 1 when the solution ph is above this value the nzc surface is charged with negative due to the coverage with negative charges of oh i e cation adsorption is favored while the nzc surface is charged with positive due to the coverage with positive charges of h when the solution ph is below 8 1 i e the anion adsorption is favored also this figure shows that nzc is highly charged with a positive charge at ph in the range of 4 6 which elucidates the high removal of cipr at the aforementioned range at cipr solution ph of 4 6 cipr molecules become negative due to the protonation of amine groups and thus the attraction force increased between the nzc particles and cipr molecules the removal of cipr became less than 80 when the solution ph value was above 8 because the cipr molecule lost the protons from the carboxyl groups in its structure and converted them to anions the repulsion force increased between the nzc particles and cipr molecules because both have similar charges resulting in lower removal of cipr in this case nzc represents a cost effective eco friendly adsorbent of cipr from pharmaceutical wastewater because most of these kinds of wastewaters are within or near neutral 3 2 5 cipr solution temperature kinetics and thermodynamic studies the effect of cipr solution temperature on the uptake of cipr using nzc is explained through the results presented in fig 5 a the results show that the removal of cipr using nzc ranged between 86 5 and 92 in the range of cipr solution temperature of 25 40 c the maximum removal of 92 was achieved at 30 c and a small drop in the removal of cipr occurred at 40 c this ineffective difference in the removal of cipr antibiotic by nzc in the temperature range of 25 40 c demonstrated that nzc is an efficient adsorbent for removal of cipr at the aforementioned range of temperature and the adsorption process was exothermic eze et al 12 pointed out that increasing the temperature of a solution containing ciprofloxacin in the range of 27 50 c caused a 10 reduction in the removal percentage of ciprofloxacin using acid modified dialium guineense tamarind seeds mohammed et al 4 used pistachio shell powder coated with zinc oxide nanoparticles to adsorb amoxicillin ciprofloxacin and tetracycline from water simultaneously and noticed a reduction in the removal percentage of ciprofloxacin when the temperature increased from 25 to 35 c mohseni bandpi et al 14 reported a decrease in the adsorption capacity of magnetic fe3o4 nanoparticles used to remove cephalexin from water when the temperature increased from 10 to 30 c mohammed et al 3 found that raising the temperature of a solution containing tetracycline to 30 c and above reduced the removal efficiency in the presence of pistachio shell coated with zno nanoparticles as an adsorbent however more study is required to perceive the kinetics of the adsorption process at different temperatures as well as the thermodynamic parameters are required to understand the nature of the adsorption process by nzc the mechanism and characteristics of adsorption can be explained by studying the adsorption kinetic models the linearized equations used in the kinetic and thermodynamic studies are shown in table 3 the kinetics of adsorption of cipr by nzc were studied via pseudo first order model given by eq 3 pseudo second order model given by eq 4 and the intra particle diffusion model given by eq 5 the results are presented in fig 5 b d and table 4 the results show that the pseudo second order model successfully fitted the experimental data of cipr uptake with r2 of 0 997 1 according to this model the experimental adsorption capacity at different selected solution temperatures was close to the predicted equilibrium adsorption capacity therefore the pseudo second order model is better than the pseudo first order model in representing the adsorption data which means that the adsorption of cipr by nzc is a chemisorption process the results obtained by the intra particle diffusion model are shown in fig 5 d and table 4 the plot of equilibrium adsorption capacity against the second root of time did not fit the linear equation and it took multi stages it indicates the adsorption process of cipr on nzc occurred in three mechanisms of adsorption adsorption on an external surface intra particle pore diffusion and adsorption on the internal sites in which the intra particle diffusion is not the controlling mechanism since the plots did not pass the origin point it means that the external surface adsorption influences the adsorption of cipr from the solution also the results presented in the table show that increasing the solution temperature to 30 c reduced the value of cip from 24 731 to 20 893 mg g indicating a reduction in the resistance caused by the thickness of the exterior liquid film however further increases in the solution temperature to 35 and 40 c resulted in less reduction in the value of cip accompanied by increasing the value of ki increasing the value of ki refers to enhancing the diffusivity of the adsorbate molecules by increasing the solution temperature therefore reducing the removal of cipr using nzc with increasing the solution temperature above 30 c is attributed to the possibility of desorbing some adsorbed antibiotic molecules due to weakening the attraction force between the adsorbate and adsorbent surface determination of the thermodynamic parameters was conducted using eq 6 eq 7 and eq 8 the results of the thermodynamic study represented by the van t hoff curve are shown in fig 5 e and the values of s h kd and g are presented in table 5 the negative values of g presented in table 5 identified the adsorption of cipr by nzc is spontaneous also increasing the solution temperature resulted in a very small decrease in the negative values of g indicating a slight reduction in the spontaneity of the process also the negative value of s refers to reducing the randomness on the adsorbent solution interface moreover the negative value of h refers to that the adsorption of cipr by nzc is exothermic 3 2 6 adsorption isotherms the equilibrium adsorption isotherms were studied using the linear form of the four well known isotherm models namely the langmuir isotherm model given by eq 9 the freundlich isotherm model given by eq 10 dubinin radushkevitch d r isotherm model given by eq 11 eq 12 and eq 13 and temkin isotherm model given by eq 14 and eq 15 the model s curves are shown in fig 6 and the model s constants are presented in table 6 the results show that the freundlich isotherm model is suitable to represent the experimental results with a value of r2 0 992 higher than of the other models and the value of 1 n was 0 805 these results indicate the multilayer adsorption of cipr onto heterogeneous adsorption sites on the nzc also the experimental results fitted to the langmuir isotherm model with a maximum adsorption capacity of 87 719 mg g and r2 of 0 974 which indicates occurring of favorable and physical adsorption however the value of the temkin model constant bt which was found to be 184 kj mol i e 80 kj mol indicates occurring of chemical adsorption d r isotherm model represented the experimental data with a fairly acceptable r2 value of 0 863 however it confirmed the physical nature of cipr adsorption by nzc due to the e value being 0 707 kj mol i e 8 kj mol based on the comprehensive findings of the kinetic and isotherm studies it can be concluded that the adsorption process of cipr by nzc combined both chemisorption and physisorption a comparison can be made among the outcomes of maximum capacity obtained in the current study and those obtained by previous work published in the last two years is shown in table 7 nzc showed acceptable adsorption capacity despite the variation of surface characteristics of the used adsorbents and the concentrations of cipr chosen for each study eventually it can be considered that nzc is an efficient adsorbent that can be recommended for the removal of cipr antibiotics from wastewater 4 conclusions the removal of ciprofloxacin cipr antibiotics from the water was studied in the adsorption process using zsm 5 nanocrystals carbon composites nzc fabrication of nzc was carried out using environment friendly adhesive made of sucrose citric acid followed by carbonization to obtain a solid final product the results of characterization proved the feasibility of assembling zsm 5 nanocrystals and carbon at moderate conditions without the need for hydrothermal treatment also the prepared composite showed favorable ability to adsorb cipr antibiotics from solutions at different conditions it was found that the higher removal efficiency was obtained for 100 ppm of cipr antibiotic from 100 ml solutions using 0 3 g of nzc at a solution ph of 4 6 and a solution temperature of 25 30 c good matching of the experimental data to the freundlich model and pseudo second order indicated that the adsorption process of cipr antibiotics by nzc combined the physical and chemical adsorption on heterogeneous adsorption sites in multilayers the study of the intra particle diffusion model confirmed that the adsorption on the external surface affected the adsorption of cipr antibiotics using nzc and the intra particle diffusion is not the determining step the thermodynamic study proved that the adsorption process of cipr antibiotics by nzc was feasible exothermic and spontaneous therefore nzc is efficiently endorsed for the adsorption process to remove cipr antibiotics from wastewater declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
13062,in the present study the photocatalytic efficiency of a novel zno fe3o4 tio2 nanocomposite derived from metal organic framework mil 125 ti was investigated for the removal of reactive blue 21 under ultraviolet uv light irradiation x ray diffraction analysis and energy dispersive x ray spectrometer combined with vibrating sample magnetometer revealed crystalline oxides characterized by the coexistence of the anatase tio2 phase and zno fe3o4 particles the bet results revealed that the as synthesized oxide nanomaterials were mesoporous with the specific surface are about 12 smaller than that of metal organic framework mil 125 ti which developed of noble metal anchored oxide for photocatalytic processes the experimental findings revealed that the photocatalytic degradation capability of zno fe3o4 tio2 is about five times higher than that of pure mil 125 ti the optimum photocatalytic potential of 99 for discoloration of reactive blue 21 rb21 dye was assigned at ph of 2 initial dye concentration of 50 mg l photocatalyst dose of 30 mg 100 ml and temperature of 45 c the as synthesized zno fe3o4 tio2 composite was not thermodynamically favorable at all temperatures furthermore the rb21 removal efficiency with zno fe3o4 tio2 nanocomposite retained 97 10 from 99 89 of its initial photocatalytic activity after five successive catalytic cycles accordingly zno fe3o4 tio2 can be suggested as new promising alternatives for the reduction of colored dye wastewater from the textile industry keywords mil 125 ti zno fe3o4 tio2 photocatalytic removal transition state theory 1 introduction in recent decades wastewater problems have become one of the most environmental challenges due to the huge amounts of produced organic pollutants from human activities 1 6 among those the wastewater effluent of textile and paper industries has been received special attention regarding their environmental burdens and damages dye as an organic pollutant is the most abundant and hazardous pollutant in the effluent of dye manufacturing textile and paper industry 7 in this regard reactive dyes are wildly utilized in the textile and paper industries for dying cotton fiber because of their unique characteristics such as bright colors better dyeing and reducing energy consumption 8 9 during these procedures 15 of colors are discharged into the effluents accordingly the wastewaters with a high concentration of colors change the ability of biological cycles through discharging into the aquatic environments by affecting the process of photosynthesis the reduction of light penetration the oxygenation of the water and however their outstanding carcinogenic mutagenic and toxicity potential 10 therefore researchers have studied different methods for the treatment of colored wastewater comprising adsorption ozonization chemical oxidation and reverse osmosis 11 according to the literature 4 it should be highlighted that the application of conventional processes such as coagulation and absorption are not effective enough to remove the organic compounds from these effluents incomplete degradation of organic compounds and transferring them from one phase to another are considered as the main drawbacks of these approaches furthermore the other methods including filtration sedimentation and membrane use are costly and these can also create secondary pollutants 12 another prevalent method for splitting colored wastewater is advanced oxidation processes aops under uv irradiation accompanied by an efficient catalyst predominantly such as titanium dioxide tio2 or zinc oxide zno some advantages of this method are as follows non toxicity high efficiency cost effectiveness and environmental friendly in addition to all these benefits this method mineralizes organic dyes completely into h2o co2 and mineral acids with no secondary pollutants formation towards finding a novel approach for encountering water pollutants metal organic framework mofs consisting of organic linkers and metal clusters are at the heart of focusing as a new class of porous crystalline materials for overcoming this challenge that is due to the unique characteristics of these materials including large surface area porosity and crystalline structures hence mofs have been used in different fields namely h2 storage 13 carbon dioxide capture catalysis and optical materials 14 the researchers also suggested that mofs have the ability to behave as semiconductors when exposed to light 15 this process provides a unique platform for light harvesting and subsequently photo induced catalysis for h2 evolution 14 co2 reduction 16 and organic pollutants degradation and transformation 17 in this sense mil 125 mil material of institute lavoisier is one of the most well known mof types it is manufactured from composing of basic units of ti8o8 oh 4 o2c c6h5 co2 6 constructed from corner sharing octahedral titanium units resulting in a porous three dimensional quasi cubic tetragonal structure 18 however a limited number of investigations confirmed that the properties of mil 125 could be improved under ti modification entitled as mil 125 ti which led to the amelioration of their stability permanent porosity and photocatalytic activities 19 to date the synergistic effects of mofs coupled with cds fe3o4 zno and c3n4 have been addressed and their great advantages were distinguished 20 21 furthermore with a special interest in concerning zno as an effective semiconductor zno has been widely applied in photocatalytic processes due to its wide bandgap 3 3 ev the exciting binding energy of 60 mv chemical and thermal stability 22 to achieve favorable characteristics such as high specific surface area and effective separation of charge carriers tailoring of photocatalyst structures has been recognized as a promising strategy for instance the impact of hierarchical structure at different levels on photocatalytic reactions was previously addressed 23 these multidimensional corresponding effects can be summarized as flows the amplification of absorption capacity dealing with the light repeatedly scattering from the surface of multilevel structures the decline of charge hole recombination that facilitates their availability on the surface of photocatalyst and ultimately the hierarchical structure increases the proportion of active catalyst site 24 besides according to the literature 25 the application of the magnetic based method can also boost photocatalyst efficiency in this context the magnetic responsive catalysts show good recyclability in wastewater purification compared with traditional methods such as centrifugation and filtration furthermore because of less energy demand the magnetic separation feasibility of pollutants by magnetic catalysts is more profitable from environmental and economical perspectives 26 27 in comparison to the pure metal oxide of zno and tio2 zno tio2 binary metal oxide composite showed enhanced photocatalytic activity in the decolorization of brilliant golden yellow 28 methylene blue 29 30 and in the methyl orange 31 dyes in this work the combination of ternary metal oxide tio2 and zno fe3o4 composite in a two step synthesis method was fabricated based on mof ti application by mixed solvo hydrothermal and sol gel methods and is used as photocatalysts to degrade decolorize organic dyes in aqueous media consequently tio2 powders are successfully coated on magnetic zno fe3o4 composites and can be easily separated from the aqueous solution by using an external magnetic field which is a noticeable advantage meanwhile the separation of zno tio2 binary metal oxide is difficult in response to the aforementioned gaps the current study was tried to propose a novel and facile approach for manufacturing a high efficient photocatalyst with high photochemical stability and a large specific surface area to degrade the organic dyes from aqueous solutions to achieve these goals a highly efficient photocatalyst i e zno fe3o4 tio2 composite was synthesized via a concurrent application of the solvothermal and hydrothermal methods towards the effective removal of organic dyes from aqueous solution a simple and novel method has been suggested to synthesize a porous tio2 structure derived from mil 125 ti and zno fe3o4 tio2 composite afterward the optimization process was conducted under different effective variables comprising the effects of the catalyst dosage ph condition initial dye concentration and temperature finally the possible regeneration of the as prepared zno fe3o4 tio2 composite was investigated through five succeeding stages for the degradation of rb21 dye in an aqueous solution under uv irradiation the synthesized zno fe3o4 tio2 and their intermediates were analyzed by different characterization tests and thermodynamic studies were also carried out to promote the knowledge regarding the performed removal reactions 2 experimental 2 1

morphology of prepared samples was studied by scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy sem edx analysis figs 2 and 3 the sem images of mil 125 ti were demonstrated in fig 2a in this figure two kinds of mil 125 ti with different morphology of circulating plate and decahedron shapes were recognized however in the different ratio concentrations of reactants the different shapes of mil 125 ti were synthesized 34 based on the archived results when the concentration of reactants was decreased a disk shape morphology appeared while by increasing the concentration of reactants the disk shape particles grew to octahedral and decahedral morphologies of ti based mof 24 therefore different morphologies of mil 125 could be obtained by performing suitable ranges of reactants concentration levels the attained shapes of as prepared mil 125 ti were disk like and decahedral structure with smooth surface the decahedral structures of mil 125 are proved by the previous report 35 the sem image of mil 125 ti zno showed a nanosheet structure for the as synthesized composite which was observed in fig 2b furthermore the edx analysis of mil 125 ti zno proved the presence of ti and zn metals in as synthesized composite 24 as illustrated in fig 3a the sem image of spherical fe3o4 nanoparticles and zno fe3o4 particles are shown in fig 2c and d respectively according to fig 2c fe3o4 nanoparticles were sphere shaped and clustered in a fine category with a range size of 200 nm fig 2d elucidated that the magnetic coating of zno particles was successfully occurred along with some agglomeration formation and the increase of the particle size the sem image in fig 2d reveals that all the zno fe3o4 nanoparticles are irregular granules with complex size and shape dependencies and have a wide particle size distribution the edx analysis of zno fe3o4 indicated that the fe3o4 and magnetic zno were successfully synthesized fig 3b the result was in close agreement with previous experimental results 36 tio2 particles fig 2e were synthesized for comparison with the final composite the particles of tio2 disclosed a spherical shape in strict accordance with the previous report 37 fig 2f shows the structure and surface morphology of the zno fe3o4 tio2 composite according to the sem results the mixed particles with different sizes and shapes were distinguishable the rough surface and change of particle size confirmed the successful modification of the synthesized mof via the zno fe3o4 particle application fig 2f corresponding to tio2 particles loaded onto zno fe3o4 tio2 composites shows that the nanocomposite s surface contains small fractures due to the embedded and well dispersed metal oxide particles onto final zno fe3o4 tio2 composites accordingly the presence of zn fe and ti metals was confirmed by the edx analysis of the zno fe3o4 tio2 composite fig 3c therefore due to the presence of different metals and particles in the structure of the zno fe3o4 tio2 composite no harmony among the size and shapes of its components was identified 3 2 xrd pattern analysis the xrd analysis was used to study the crystalline structure of prepared samples mil 125 ti mil 125 ti zno fe3o4 zno zno fe3o4 tio2 and zno fe3o4 tio2 as shown in fig 4 in the as synthesized mil 125 ti the diffraction peak was found at 2θ 10 1 12 06 15 8 16 96 18 41 19 96 and 23 11 which could be ascribed to the reflection from the 200 211 103 222 312 400 and 204 planes 38 furthermore these crystal plans indicated that the metal ions tio6 and organic linker bdc linked together and manufactured the disk and octahedral shapes these results were in close agreement with the previous experimental report 39 the xrd pattern of bare zno and mil 125 zno composite confirmed the development of crystals in their structures the strong diffraction peaks at 31 76 34 61 36 41 47 71 56 76 63 01 66 56 68 16 69 16 and 72 91 could be indexed to the 100 002 101 102 110 103 112 200 112 and 201 planes respectively according to databases no 36 1451 40 regarding the fe3o4 particles the observed peaks at 2θ 30 76 36 01 43 83 54 21 57 61 63 11 71 71 and 74 76 indicate the crystalline structure of fe3o4 that can be indexed with jcpds card no 19 0629 41 however the zno fe3o4 crystalline structure indexed by jcpds card no no 36 1451 with plans 100 101 102 110 103 and 112 these results illustrated that the zno fe3o4 composite was successfully synthesized 36 42 finally xrd patterns of tio2 particles and zno fe3o4 tio2 composite demonstrated the consistency of the anatase phase for the porous tio2 derived from mil 125 ti 43 however the linking between zno fe3o4 and mil 125 ti in the as synthesized samples was constituted the xrd pattern of zno fe3o4 tio2 involved the crystalline structure of tio2 at 24 41 and 25 61 zno at 33 41 and 70 21 and fe3o4 at 30 66 35 91 41 06 57 91 and 62 81 44 as a result the xrd patterns confirmed that the desired structures were successfully synthesized in each case and the crystallite phases were favorably developed in their structures 3 3 ft ir analysis the infrared spectra of as prepared samples are displayed in fig 5 according to fig 5a the observed absorption peaks at 1393 95 cm 1 and 1660 42 cm 1 in the mil 125 ti belonged to the symmetrical stretching vibration of oco based on small residues of zinc acetate and aromatic carboxylic acids 40 also the peaks at the range of 1488 1610 cm 1 and a wide peak at 400 800 cm 1 illustrated the aromatic cc ring vibrations and tioc group vibrations respectively 35 the spectrum of zno mil 125 ti composite represented a distinguishable peak at around 855 cm 1 which was assigned to the tiozn stretching group in the composite fig 5b the low absorption at 1093 cm 1 was ascribed to a carboxylic acid co stretching mode furthermore a broad absorption peak around 1387 cm 1 confirmed the contribution of tio and tioc groups in the mil 125 ti zno composite indicating the presence of the tio2 layer the other peaks at 1570 cm 1 may be described as the asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibration of the carboxylic group cc formed from the reaction of the intermediate 45 fig 5c and d indicated the ft ir spectra of pure fe3o4 particles and zno fe3o4 composite respectively in fig 5c the absorption bands at 580 cm 1 and 448 cm 1 was illustrated the feo stretching mode of octahedral sites in the fe3o4 particles 46 the absorption bands around 458 690 and 1410 cm 1 in fig 5d concerning the zno fe3o4 were originated from the vibration modes of zno feo and ch3 respectively the results of fe3o4 and zno fe3o4 appeared that all functional groups associated with the fe3o4 and zno fe3o4 were available in the structure of as synthesized zno fe3o4 composite 32 the ftir spectrum of the final composite i e zno fe3o4 tio2 is shown in fig 5e given this the peak at 471 and 547 cm 1 indicated the stretching and bending vibration of zno and tio respectively in addition the absorption peak at 547 cm 1 corresponded to the feo functional group this was in agreement with the previous literature 47 the emanated bond at around 3400 cm 1 could be assigned to the hydroxyl groups stretching vibration in all samples originating from the oh bonds of water molecules 48 furthermore the peak at around 2900 cm 1 can be ascribed to the acetate bonds in the zno fe3o4 and zno fe3o4 tio2 composites 3 4 bet surface area and porosity analysis to evaluate the porosity and specific surface area of the as prepared mil 125 ti and zno fe3o4 tio2 derived from mil 125 ti the bet analysis was conducted the n2 adsorption desorption and the mp plots are shown in fig 6a b besides the corresponding information concerning the bet analysis of the mil 125 and zno fe3o4 tio2 is disclosed in table 1 according to fig 6a the as prepared mil 125 ti elucidated a pattern of hybrid i iv isotherm and hysteresis loop at p p0 0 4 indicating the predominant formation of microporous structures along with the restricted development of mesoporous ones based on the iupac classification 49 this assertion can be confirmed regarding the depicted patterns by the bjh and mp plot of mil 125 ti that demonstrated the majority of developed porosities possessed a diameter less than 2 nm table 1 also represents an approximately 81 contribution of microporous structures in the as synthesized mil 125 ti however the n2 adsorption desorption isotherm of zno fe3o4 tio2 showed a v isotherm model with a hysteresis loop at p p0 0 6 fig 6b indicating the zno fe3o4 tio2 composite was mainly involved the mesoporous structure in fact 99 of the total porosity in the zno fe3o4 tio2 structure was mesopore with a very negligible contribution of microporosity table 1 the specific surface area was considerably decreased by proceeding from the mil 125 ti to zno fe3o4 tio2 with an amount of 603 96 and 51 481 m2 g 1 respectively this outstanding surface area decrement accompanied by the extreme development of mesoporosity in the zno fe3o4 tio2 structure was strongly associated with the redecoration of its manufacturing components during the several successive processes which were initiated with the mil 125 ti contribution although these processes led to a significant reduction of surface area in the zno fe3o4 tio2 in comparison with the mil 125 ti the mean pore diameter promoted from 2 13 to 29 03 nm accordingly the obtained characteristics results for the mil 125 ti were in accordance with previous study findings 50 3 5 tga analysis thermal stability properties of the as synthesized samples in each step at different times and temperatures were represented in fig 6c the tga curve indicated a three step weight loss in the mil 125 ti the first weight loss under the calcination process was observed at 100 c which was due to the available oh groups water in the mil 125 ti in the range of 100 300 c the second slow loss weight belonged to the removal of dmf molecules and unreacted organic chemicals captured by the mil 125 ti pores were observed which were degraded under heat treatment a study was also assigned the mass reduction of cu2o fe3o4 mil 101 fe at 25 to 350 c associated with water and dmf 51 at above 300 400 c the mil 125 ti started a phase transition and structural reorganization to change into the tio2 structure it was confirmed that the mil 125 ti instantaneously decomposed to tio2 at 450 c and the formed structure was stable at 500 900 c 21 regarding the obtained results the amount of weight loss after calcination of the mil 125 ti zno was not significant it suggested a complete decomposition of the mil 125 ti structure during the hydrothermal process which led to the removal of any soluble species after calcination the investigation of thermal stability of pure fe3o4 and zno fe3o4 composite showed 12 80 and 11 56 loss weight respectively this decrement mass can be related to the removal of h2o groups and unreacted organic compounds from the as prepared samples 52 accordingly the tga analysis of the zno fe3o4 tio2 composite indicated a 5 loss weight in the range of 500 550 c this weight loss can be dealt with by the degradation of available oh groups and organic compounds in the structure of this composite in addition the results of the tga curve of the zno fe3o4 tio2 composite showed higher thermal stability and lower loss weight of this composite compared with the zno fe3o4 and mil 125 ti fig 6c it can be ascribed in association with the presence of zno fe3o4 groups on the surface of mil 125 ti and interaction between them correspondingly 53 3 6 magnetic properties the magnetic properties of the as prepared magnetic samples fe3o4 particles zno fe3o4 and zno fe3o4 tio2 composite were measured by the vibrating sample magnetometer method vsm at room temperature fig 6d the magnetic hysteresis loops of fe3o4 zno fe3o4 and zno fe3o4 tio2 confirmed that all samples were magnetics based on the vsm analysis the saturation value is 63 77 emu g 1 for fe3o4 particles 22 37 emu g 1 and 23 95 emu g 1 were obtained for the zno fe3o4 and zno fe3o4 tio2 respectively the reduction of magnetization properties in the zno fe3o4 tio2 composite was related to the existence of nonmagnetic particles tio2 derived from the mil 125 ti it confirmed that the final composite was successfully encapsulated with the zno fe3o4 particles moreover regarding the vsm curve which has an s like form the as synthesis magnetic composite comprising fe3o4 zno fe3o4 and zno fe3o4 tio2 possessed superparamagnetic properties at room temperature however they can be easily separated from an aqueous environment by performing an external magnetic field 44 the same result was reported by 51 who demonstrated the superparamagnetic nature of cu2o fe3o4 mil 101 fe which could easily be separated from water aqueous using a magnetic field 3 7 photocatalytic activity the photocatalytic efficiency of the as synthesized zno fe3o4 tio2 composite was analyzed by the degradation of rb21 aqueous solution in a quartz tube under uv irradiation 8 w lamp the decomposition rate was about 5 times greater than pure mil 125 ti suggesting the high photocatalytic ability of the zno fe3o4 tio2 composite data not shown in fig 7 a h the photodegradation of rb21 in the different operational conditions including the various ph initial dye concentration catalyst dosage and temperatures was studied in the photocatalytic process the ph of the solution plays an important role in the degradation of various organic pollutants 54 the amphoteric behavior of semiconductor oxidants is effective on the surface charges of the photocatalysts 55 therefore the effect of ph was investigated in the range of 2 9 with an initial dye concentration of 100 mg l 25 mg of photocatalyst at ambient temperature 25 c under uv light for 120 min however the adsorptions of rb21 dye on zno fe3o4 tio2 nanocomposite were conducted in dark conditions for 30 min to obtain the adsorption equilibrium the percentage of adsorbed rb21 dye after 30 min in dark condition was 19 96 22 22 14 44 17 76 3 10 2 25 4 50 and 3 80 at ph 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and 9 respectively the results showed that the pseudo first order according to the l h kinetic reaction is the model that gives the best fit for the rb21 dye degradation by zno fe3o4 tio2 nanocomposite with correlation coefficients r2 from 0 9572 to 0 9955 fig 7a the corresponding apparent rate constant k app values k app of rb21 oxidation of 0 552 0 342 0 174 0 174 0 138 0 156 0 132 and 0 150 min 1 were achieved at ph 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and 9 respectively fig 7b the results demonstrated that the degradation of rb21 in an acidic environment took place with higher efficiency than the alkaline and neutral region this means that acidic ph electrostatic interactions between reactive blue 21 anionic dye and positive zno fe3o4 tio2 results to enhanced adsorption percentage with a corresponding high rate of degradation a conclusion that can be drawn from aforementioned result is that the zno fe3o4 coated tio2 particles have positive charge in acidic solution while they have negative charge in alkaline solution as shown in fig 7a and b by increasing ph from acidic to alkaline the removal rate of dye decreased which was in agreement with 56 our results exhibited that the removal efficiency and the apparent rate constant values k app of about 80 20 and 0 552 min 1 respectively were achieved for rb21 dye at ph 2 by using 25 mg 100 ml zno fe3o4 tio2 composite the higher degradation of anionic rb21 dye under acidic and lower under alkaline conditions was elucidated in greater detail by the above phenomenon there is stated that by increasing the ph from 5 to 11 the degradation efficiency of the pollutant decreased due to the reduction of the interactions between photocatalyst and pollutant the effect of ph can be explained by the interaction between h species and the surface load of the zno fe3o4 tio2 nanocomposite in acidic phs the surface of the photocatalyst has a positive charge and h radicals act as strong oxidants 57 our result was in agreement with the previous reports 58 59 furthermore the proposed photocatalytic reaction mechanism for the degradation of rb21 is as follows 60 61 a generation of electron hole pairs free free electrons from valance band vb absorb a photon which reveals energy greater than the bandgap energy and valance electrons travel to the conduction band cb leaving holes in the cb 12 zno fe 3 o 4 tio 2 hv e cb h vb b direct generation recombination associated with photon emission electrons move from the cb into the vb and neutralize holes 13 e cb h vb photon c vb holes h trapping at holes

o 2 oh oh o 2 26 h vb oh oh 27 h 2 o 2 hv 2 oh finally the formation of ros play a crucial role in the photocatalysis on zno fe3o4 tio2 for photodegradation 28 rb 21 dye o 2 mineralized products 29 rb 21 dye oh mineralized products the effect of catalyst dosage changes on the rb21 removal efficiency is shown in fig 7c and d as shown with increasing the photocatalyst dosage from 10 to 30 mg the photocatalytic activity increased which can be explained as follows the presence of more photocatalyst particles in the dye solution leads to the turbidity enhancement that reduces the photocatalytic activities 62 the obtained results elucidated that by increasing the photocatalyst dosage the amount of dye removal from the aqueous solution increased this is because providing extensive surface area and more active sites to adsorb dye molecules 56 this is to be noted that the adsorption portion of the dye molecule on the catalyst surface may play an important role in photocatalytic activity although as mentioned above the adsorption was not noticeable at all ph values however based on adsorption amount and suitable pore radius of zno fe3o4 tio2 nanocomposite fig 6b the dye molecule migrated inside the pore of zno fe3o4 tio2 nanocomposite reached good dispersion which may result in a good photocatalytic activity it is noteworthy to mention that the increase of catalyst dosage was not illustrated a positive effect on dye molecule adsorption at doses higher than 30 mg hence it could be inferred that the optimum dosage at the applied condition was 30 mg and at the higher catalyst concentration the increase of aqueous turbidity possessed a negative effect on the photocatalytic activities in this condition the catalyst overdosage prevented the photocatalyst particles from hitting influenced by the received light photons 63 the pseudo first order reaction according to the l h kinetic model was the best fit for the rb21 dye degradation by zno fe3o4 tio2 nanocomposite with correlation coefficients r2 from 0 9617 to 0 9960 fig 7c however the maximum rb21 removal efficiency of about 65 36 was attained at 30 mg 100 ml of zno fe3o4 tio2 composite correspondingly we predicted an apparent rate constant of 0 27 min 1 from the nonlinear behavior l h model fig 7d our results are also in good agreement with other literature works for a similar type of photocatalyst the initial concentration of rb21 is another effective parameter in photocatalytic reactions based on the literature 64 by increasing the dye concentration the decolorization rate constant k app decreases this effect can be ascribed to two different mechanisms first at the high concentrations of rb21 active sites may be occupied by the dye ions that reduce the production of free radicals on the catalyst surface 65 second at high concentrations as well the input photons absorb by the dye molecules and do not collide with the photocatalytic particles hence the photocatalytic degradation efficiency decreases consequently 62 in this study concentrations of 50 100 150 and 200 mg l at ph 3 temperature 25 and photocatalyst dosage 0 3 g of rb21 were analyzed for 120 min under uvc light our results exhibited that the removal percentages of about 76 38 65 36 50 27 and 32 52 were achieved for rb21 concentrations of 50 100 150 and 200 mg l respectively fig 7 e and f demonstrated that the high value of correlation coefficients r2 from 0 9897 to 9952 agreed that the degradation data were fitted well with pseudo first order reaction according to the l h kinetic model however the percentage of adsorbed rb21 dye after 30 min in dark condition was 16 01 16 61 12 98 and 10 74 at the rb21 dye concentration of 50 100 150 and 200 mg l respectively according to the results with increasing the concentration of dye the removal efficiency was decreased it can be due to the reduction of free radical production arising from the photocatalyst application similar results were reported for the degradation of a β lactam drug cefixime from an aqueous solution with swcnt zno fe3o4 heterojunction nanocomposite by 40 furthermore because of rb21 concentration increment the overall amount of adsorbed input uv radiations by the dye molecules increased 55 the temperature effects on the photocatalyst removal efficiencies were analyzed in the range from 15 to 45 c under constant conditions of other parameters fig 7g and h nevertheless the high value of r2 from 0 9897 to 9952 agreed that the data were fitted well with the pseudo first order l h kinetic model for rb21 dye degradation the adsorbed amount of rb21 dye was predicted during the dark condition for 30 min to reach the equilibrium the amount of adsorbed rb21 dye was 19 20 16 61 15 42 and 12 88 at the temperature of 15 25 35 and 45 c respectively our results demonstrated that the photocatalytic activity of the zno fe3o4 tio2 composite is influenced by the reaction temperature the apparent rate constant values k app of photocatalytic oxidation of 0 081 0 186 0 240 and 0 366 min 1 were achieved for temperature 15 25 35 and 45 c respectively correspondingly the maximum removal of 68 87 was obtained at temperature 45 c explaining direct oxidation through the photogenerated valence band holes 66 and the recombination of charge carriers e h is enhanced on the other hand this temperature is considered the best temperature for effective photolysis of rb21 dye structure given this with temperature increasing the electron hole recombination e h and viscosity of the solution decreased resulting in the increment of mobility and diffusion of molecules thus the rate of photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants increased correspondingly 67 3 8 thermodynamic studies based on the results the photocatalytic reaction of the zno fe3o4 tio2 composite for rb21 degradation followed a pseudo first order kinetic with the maximum removal efficiency at 45 c the arrhenius and eyring plots by the application of zno fe3o4 tio2 at the different temperatures are plotted in fig 8 besides the kinetic and activation parameters of zno fe3o4 tio2 are demonstrated in table 2 according to the results the positive value of enthalpy of activation δ h demonstrated that the photocatalytic process was endothermic in nature due to the electrostatic interaction between the hydrophobic species on the photocatalyst surface and organic pollutants it should be highlighted that the negative activation entropy change value δ s showed that the interaction between potential determining ions with the active surface sites was less hydrated at the solid liquid interface 37 according to table 2 the observed values of δ h and δ s were 34 17 kj mol 1 and 0 214 kj mol 1 k respectively moreover the activated complex values of δ g were computed at the temperatures 288 298 308 and 318 k equal to 95 80 97 93 100 07 102 21 kj mol 1 respectively table 2 the positive value of gibbs free energy of activation δ g 0 at all temperatures and the increment trend of δ g with the increase of temperature illustrated that the rb21 degradation process was nonspontaneous besides the other corresponding parameters such as ea 36 68 kj mol 1 and r2 0 9500 were calculated for the photodegradation process of rb21 by zno fe3o4 tio2 catalyst application table 2 however the temperature effects from 15 to 45 c were investigated 3 9 reusability experiments the reusability of as synthesized zno fe3o4 tio2 composite was investigated at a constant condition ph 3 initial dye concentration 50 mg l catalyst dose 30 mg at ambient temperature as shown in fig 9 after ending the first reaction the catalyst was aggregated with an external magnetic field and dried at 70 c for 12 h and then used for the second run the result revealed that after 5 cycles the photocatalytic efficiency of the zno fe3o4 tio2 composite was higher than 95 with no significant decrease during the successive runs further analysis also demonstrated that the photocatalytic activity of zno fe3o4 tio2 was considerably enhanced in comparison with its structural components i e the mil 125 ti zno fe3o4 and zno given these results the zno fe3o4 tio2 derived from the mil 125 ti could be effectively utilized as a useful photocatalyst under uv irradiation for the degradation of rb21 however the stability of the zno fe3o4 tio2 composite under successive practical runs confirmed that it can be proposed as a promising composite in the wastewater treatment process from an economic perspective finally the zno fe3o4 tio2 composite photocatalysts demonstrated well stability with no drastic decrement efficiency 5 which is considered from a practical point of view furthermore with aim of scale up production in the future and motivating the interest of industry owners the potential regenerability and cost effectiveness properties of the final photocatalyst may be at the heat of consideration 4 conclusion the synthesis of novel and efficient zno fe3o4 tio2 heterostructure is proposed through a solvo hydrothermal method towards the removal of rb21 from aqueous solutions in this study the results elucidated the contribution of functional groups i e zn o ti o and fe o in the tailoring of the zno fe3o4 tio2 structure furthermore by going forward from the mil 125 ti to the zno fe3o4 tio2 formation through succeeding processes the mesoporosity and mean pore diameter developed and thermal stability significantly increased as desired properties with positive impacts on the zno fe3o4 tio2 photocatalytic activities according to the optimization process the removal efficiency potential of zno fe3o4 tio2 was considerably enhanced 95 in acidic ph and high temperatures 45 c the thermodynamic investigation also revealed that the rb21 reduction from an aqueous solution was taken place through nonspontaneous and exothermic processes besides after five successive catalytic cycles the synthesized zno fe3o4 tio2 elucidated 95 of its initial removal potential indicating its notable efficiency from a practical perspective summing up the synthesized zno fe3o4 tio2 can be recommended as a promising

13062,in the present study the photocatalytic efficiency of a novel zno fe3o4 tio2 nanocomposite derived from metal organic framework mil 125 ti was investigated for the removal of reactive blue 21 under ultraviolet uv light irradiation x ray diffraction analysis and energy dispersive x ray spectrometer combined with vibrating sample magnetometer revealed crystalline oxides characterized by the coexistence of the anatase tio2 phase and zno fe3o4 particles the bet results revealed that the as synthesized oxide nanomaterials were mesoporous with the specific surface are about 12 smaller than that of metal organic framework mil 125 ti which developed of noble metal anchored oxide for photocatalytic processes the experimental findings revealed that the photocatalytic degradation capability of zno fe3o4 tio2 is about five times higher than that of pure mil 125 ti the optimum photocatalytic potential of 99 for discoloration of reactive blue 21 rb21 dye was assigned at ph of 2 initial dye concentration of 50 mg l photocatalyst dose of 30 mg 100 ml and temperature of 45 c the as synthesized zno fe3o4 tio2 composite was not thermodynamically favorable at all temperatures furthermore the rb21 removal efficiency with zno fe3o4 tio2 nanocomposite retained 97 10 from 99 89 of its initial photocatalytic activity after five successive catalytic cycles accordingly zno fe3o4 tio2 can be suggested as new promising alternatives for the reduction of colored dye wastewater from the textile industry keywords mil 125 ti zno fe3o4 tio2 photocatalytic removal transition state theory 1 introduction in recent decades wastewater problems have become one of the most environmental challenges due to the huge amounts of produced organic pollutants from human activities 1 6 among those the wastewater effluent of textile and paper industries has been received special attention regarding their environmental burdens and damages dye as an organic pollutant is the most abundant and hazardous pollutant in the effluent of dye manufacturing textile and paper industry 7 in this regard reactive dyes are wildly utilized in the textile and paper industries for dying cotton fiber because of their unique characteristics such as bright colors better dyeing and reducing energy consumption 8 9 during these procedures 15 of colors are discharged into the effluents accordingly the wastewaters with a high concentration of colors change the ability of biological cycles through discharging into the aquatic environments by affecting the process of photosynthesis the reduction of light penetration the oxygenation of the water and however their outstanding carcinogenic mutagenic and toxicity potential 10 therefore researchers have studied different methods for the treatment of colored wastewater comprising adsorption ozonization chemical oxidation and reverse osmosis 11 according to the literature 4 it should be highlighted that the application of conventional processes such as coagulation and absorption are not effective enough to remove the organic compounds from these effluents incomplete degradation of organic compounds and transferring them from one phase to another are considered as the main drawbacks of these approaches furthermore the other methods including filtration sedimentation and membrane use are costly and these can also create secondary pollutants 12 another prevalent method for splitting colored wastewater is advanced oxidation processes aops under uv irradiation accompanied by an efficient catalyst predominantly such as titanium dioxide tio2 or zinc oxide zno some advantages of this method are as follows non toxicity high efficiency cost effectiveness and environmental friendly in addition to all these benefits this method mineralizes organic dyes completely into h2o co2 and mineral acids with no secondary pollutants formation towards finding a novel approach for encountering water pollutants metal organic framework mofs consisting of organic linkers and metal clusters are at the heart of focusing as a new class of porous crystalline materials for overcoming this challenge that is due to the unique characteristics of these materials including large surface area porosity and crystalline structures hence mofs have been used in different fields namely h2 storage 13 carbon dioxide capture catalysis and optical materials 14 the researchers also suggested that mofs have the ability to behave as semiconductors when exposed to light 15 this process provides a unique platform for light harvesting and subsequently photo induced catalysis for h2 evolution 14 co2 reduction 16 and organic pollutants degradation and transformation 17 in this sense mil 125 mil material of institute lavoisier is one of the most well known mof types it is manufactured from composing of basic units of ti8o8 oh 4 o2c c6h5 co2 6 constructed from corner sharing octahedral titanium units resulting in a porous three dimensional quasi cubic tetragonal structure 18 however a limited number of investigations confirmed that the properties of mil 125 could be improved under ti modification entitled as mil 125 ti which led to the amelioration of their stability permanent porosity and photocatalytic activities 19 to date the synergistic effects of mofs coupled with cds fe3o4 zno and c3n4 have been addressed and their great advantages were distinguished 20 21 furthermore with a special interest in concerning zno as an effective semiconductor zno has been widely applied in photocatalytic processes due to its wide bandgap 3 3 ev the exciting binding energy of 60 mv chemical and thermal stability 22 to achieve favorable characteristics such as high specific surface area and effective separation of charge carriers tailoring of photocatalyst structures has been recognized as a promising strategy for instance the impact of hierarchical structure at different levels on photocatalytic reactions was previously addressed 23 these multidimensional corresponding effects can be summarized as flows the amplification of absorption capacity dealing with the light repeatedly scattering from the surface of multilevel structures the decline of charge hole recombination that facilitates their availability on the surface of photocatalyst and ultimately the hierarchical structure increases the proportion of active catalyst site 24 besides according to the literature 25 the application of the magnetic based method can also boost photocatalyst efficiency in this context the magnetic responsive catalysts show good recyclability in wastewater purification compared with traditional methods such as centrifugation and filtration furthermore because of less energy demand the magnetic separation feasibility of pollutants by magnetic catalysts is more profitable from environmental and economical perspectives 26 27 in comparison to the pure metal oxide of zno and tio2 zno tio2 binary metal oxide composite showed enhanced photocatalytic activity in the decolorization of brilliant golden yellow 28 methylene blue 29 30 and in the methyl orange 31 dyes in this work the combination of ternary metal oxide tio2 and zno fe3o4 composite in a two step synthesis method was fabricated based on mof ti application by mixed solvo hydrothermal and sol gel methods and is used as photocatalysts to degrade decolorize organic dyes in aqueous media consequently tio2 powders are successfully coated on magnetic zno fe3o4 composites and can be easily separated from the aqueous solution by using an external magnetic field which is a noticeable advantage meanwhile the separation of zno tio2 binary metal oxide is difficult in response to the aforementioned gaps the current study was tried to propose a novel and facile approach for manufacturing a high efficient photocatalyst with high photochemical stability and a large specific surface area to degrade the organic dyes from aqueous solutions to achieve these goals a highly efficient photocatalyst i e zno fe3o4 tio2 composite was synthesized via a concurrent application of the solvothermal and hydrothermal methods towards the effective removal of organic dyes from aqueous solution a simple and novel method has been suggested to synthesize a porous tio2 structure derived from mil 125 ti and zno fe3o4 tio2 composite afterward the optimization process was conducted under different effective variables comprising the effects of the catalyst dosage ph condition initial dye concentration and temperature finally the possible regeneration of the as prepared zno fe3o4 tio2 composite was investigated through five succeeding stages for the degradation of rb21 dye in an aqueous solution under uv irradiation the synthesized zno fe3o4 tio2 and their intermediates were analyzed by different characterization tests and thermodynamic studies were also carried out to promote the knowledge regarding the performed removal reactions 2 experimental 2 1

schematically elucidates the process of zno fe3o4 tio2 synthesis through several succeeding stages 2 7 characterization scanning electron microscopy sem korea sec sne 4500 south korea was used to

morphology of prepared samples was studied by scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy sem edx analysis figs 2 and 3 the sem images of mil 125 ti were demonstrated in fig 2a in this figure two kinds of mil 125 ti with different morphology of circulating plate and decahedron shapes were recognized however in the different ratio concentrations of reactants the different shapes of mil 125 ti were synthesized 34 based on the archived results when the concentration of reactants was decreased a disk shape morphology appeared while by increasing the concentration of reactants the disk shape particles grew to octahedral and decahedral morphologies of ti based mof 24 therefore different morphologies of mil 125 could be obtained by performing suitable ranges of reactants concentration levels the attained shapes of as prepared mil 125 ti were disk like and decahedral structure with smooth surface the decahedral structures of mil 125 are proved by the previous report 35 the sem image of mil 125 ti zno showed a nanosheet structure for the as synthesized composite which was observed in fig 2b furthermore the edx analysis of mil 125 ti zno proved the presence of ti and zn metals in as synthesized composite 24 as illustrated in fig 3a the sem image of spherical fe3o4 nanoparticles and zno fe3o4 particles are shown in fig 2c and d respectively according to fig 2c fe3o4 nanoparticles were sphere shaped and clustered in a fine category with a range size of 200 nm fig 2d elucidated that the magnetic coating of zno particles was successfully occurred along with some agglomeration formation and the increase of the particle size the sem image in fig 2d reveals that all the zno fe3o4 nanoparticles are irregular granules with complex size and shape dependencies and have a wide particle size distribution the edx analysis of zno fe3o4 indicated that the fe3o4 and magnetic zno were successfully synthesized fig 3b the result was in close agreement with previous experimental results 36 tio2 particles fig 2e were synthesized for comparison with the final composite the particles of tio2 disclosed a spherical shape in strict accordance with the previous report 37 fig 2f shows the structure and surface morphology of the zno fe3o4 tio2 composite according to the sem results the mixed particles with different sizes and shapes were distinguishable the rough surface and change of particle size confirmed the successful modification of the synthesized mof via the zno fe3o4 particle application fig 2f corresponding to tio2 particles loaded onto zno fe3o4 tio2 composites shows that the nanocomposite s surface contains small fractures due to the embedded and well dispersed metal oxide particles onto final zno fe3o4 tio2 composites accordingly the presence of zn fe and ti metals was confirmed by the edx analysis of the zno fe3o4 tio2 composite fig 3c therefore due to the presence of different metals and particles in the structure of the zno fe3o4 tio2 composite no harmony among the size and shapes of its components was identified 3 2 xrd pattern analysis the xrd analysis was used to study the crystalline structure of prepared samples mil 125 ti mil 125 ti zno fe3o4 zno zno fe3o4 tio2 and zno fe3o4 tio2 as shown in fig 4 in the as synthesized mil 125 ti the diffraction peak was found at 2θ 10 1 12 06 15 8 16 96 18 41 19 96 and 23 11 which could be ascribed to the reflection from the 200 211 103 222 312 400 and 204 planes 38 furthermore these crystal plans indicated that the metal ions tio6 and organic linker bdc linked together and manufactured the disk and octahedral shapes these results were in close agreement with the previous experimental report 39 the xrd pattern of bare zno and mil 125 zno composite confirmed the development of crystals in their structures the strong diffraction peaks at 31 76 34 61 36 41 47 71 56 76 63 01 66 56 68 16 69 16 and 72 91 could be indexed to the 100 002 101 102 110 103 112 200 112 and 201 planes respectively according to databases no 36 1451 40 regarding the fe3o4 particles the observed peaks at 2θ 30 76 36 01 43 83 54 21 57 61 63 11 71 71 and 74 76 indicate the crystalline structure of fe3o4 that can be indexed with jcpds card no 19 0629 41 however the zno fe3o4 crystalline structure indexed by jcpds card no no 36 1451 with plans 100 101 102 110 103 and 112 these results illustrated that the zno fe3o4 composite was successfully synthesized 36 42 finally xrd patterns of tio2 particles and zno fe3o4 tio2 composite demonstrated the consistency of the anatase phase for the porous tio2 derived from mil 125 ti 43 however the linking between zno fe3o4 and mil 125 ti in the as synthesized samples was constituted the xrd pattern of zno fe3o4 tio2 involved the crystalline structure of tio2 at 24 41 and 25 61 zno at 33 41 and 70 21 and fe3o4 at 30 66 35 91 41 06 57 91 and 62 81 44 as a result the xrd patterns confirmed that the desired structures were successfully synthesized in each case and the crystallite phases were favorably developed in their structures 3 3 ft ir analysis the infrared spectra of as prepared samples are displayed in fig 5 according to fig 5a the observed absorption peaks at 1393 95 cm 1 and 1660 42 cm 1 in the mil 125 ti belonged to the symmetrical stretching vibration of oco based on small residues of zinc acetate and aromatic carboxylic acids 40 also the peaks at the range of 1488 1610 cm 1 and a wide peak at 400 800 cm 1 illustrated the aromatic cc ring vibrations and tioc group vibrations respectively 35 the spectrum of zno mil 125 ti composite represented a distinguishable peak at around 855 cm 1 which was assigned to the tiozn stretching group in the composite fig 5b the low absorption at 1093 cm 1 was ascribed to a carboxylic acid co stretching mode furthermore a broad absorption peak around 1387 cm 1 confirmed the contribution of tio and tioc groups in the mil 125 ti zno composite indicating the presence of the tio2 layer the other peaks at 1570 cm 1 may be described as the asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibration of the carboxylic group cc formed from the reaction of the intermediate 45 fig 5c and d indicated the ft ir spectra of pure fe3o4 particles and zno fe3o4 composite respectively in fig 5c the absorption bands at 580 cm 1 and 448 cm 1 was illustrated the feo stretching mode of octahedral sites in the fe3o4 particles 46 the absorption bands around 458 690 and 1410 cm 1 in fig 5d concerning the zno fe3o4 were originated from the vibration modes of zno feo and ch3 respectively the results of fe3o4 and zno fe3o4 appeared that all functional groups associated with the fe3o4 and zno fe3o4 were available in the structure of as synthesized zno fe3o4 composite 32 the ftir spectrum of the final composite i e zno fe3o4 tio2 is shown in fig 5e given this the peak at 471 and 547 cm 1 indicated the stretching and bending vibration of zno and tio respectively in addition the absorption peak at 547 cm 1 corresponded to the feo functional group this was in agreement with the previous literature 47 the emanated bond at around 3400 cm 1 could be assigned to the hydroxyl groups stretching vibration in all samples originating from the oh bonds of water molecules 48 furthermore the peak at around 2900 cm 1 can be ascribed to the acetate bonds in the zno fe3o4 and zno fe3o4 tio2 composites 3 4 bet surface area and porosity analysis to evaluate the porosity and specific surface area of the as prepared mil 125 ti and zno fe3o4 tio2 derived from mil 125 ti the bet analysis was conducted the n2 adsorption desorption and the mp plots are shown in fig 6a b besides the corresponding information concerning the bet analysis of the mil 125 and zno fe3o4 tio2 is disclosed in table 1 according to fig 6a the as prepared mil 125 ti elucidated a pattern of hybrid i iv isotherm and hysteresis loop at p p0 0 4 indicating the predominant formation of microporous structures along with the restricted development of mesoporous ones based on the iupac classification 49 this assertion can be confirmed regarding the depicted patterns by the bjh and mp plot of mil 125 ti that demonstrated the majority of developed porosities possessed a diameter less than 2 nm table 1 also represents an approximately 81 contribution of microporous structures in the as synthesized mil 125 ti however the n2 adsorption desorption isotherm of zno fe3o4 tio2 showed a v isotherm model with a hysteresis loop at p p0 0 6 fig 6b indicating the zno fe3o4 tio2 composite was mainly involved the mesoporous structure in fact 99 of the total porosity in the zno fe3o4 tio2 structure was mesopore with a very negligible contribution of microporosity table 1 the specific surface area was considerably decreased by proceeding from the mil 125 ti to zno fe3o4 tio2 with an amount of 603 96 and 51 481 m2 g 1 respectively this outstanding surface area decrement accompanied by the extreme development of mesoporosity in the zno fe3o4 tio2 structure was strongly associated with the redecoration of its manufacturing components during the several successive processes which were initiated with the mil 125 ti contribution although these processes led to a significant reduction of surface area in the zno fe3o4 tio2 in comparison with the mil 125 ti the mean pore diameter promoted from 2 13 to 29 03 nm accordingly the obtained characteristics results for the mil 125 ti were in accordance with previous study findings 50 3 5 tga analysis thermal stability properties of the as synthesized samples in each step at different times and temperatures were represented in fig 6c the tga curve indicated a three step weight loss in the mil 125 ti the first weight loss under the calcination process was observed at 100 c which was due to the available oh groups water in the mil 125 ti in the range of 100 300 c the second slow loss weight belonged to the removal of dmf molecules and unreacted organic chemicals captured by the mil 125 ti pores were observed which were degraded under heat treatment a study was also assigned the mass reduction of cu2o fe3o4 mil 101 fe at 25 to 350 c associated with water and dmf 51 at above 300 400 c the mil 125 ti started a phase transition and structural reorganization to change into the tio2 structure it was confirmed that the mil 125 ti instantaneously decomposed to tio2 at 450 c and the formed structure was stable at 500 900 c 21 regarding the obtained results the amount of weight loss after calcination of the mil 125 ti zno was not significant it suggested a complete decomposition of the mil 125 ti structure during the hydrothermal process which led to the removal of any soluble species after calcination the investigation of thermal stability of pure fe3o4 and zno fe3o4 composite showed 12 80 and 11 56 loss weight respectively this decrement mass can be related to the removal of h2o groups and unreacted organic compounds from the as prepared samples 52 accordingly the tga analysis of the zno fe3o4 tio2 composite indicated a 5 loss weight in the range of 500 550 c this weight loss can be dealt with by the degradation of available oh groups and organic compounds in the structure of this composite in addition the results of the tga curve of the zno fe3o4 tio2 composite showed higher thermal stability and lower loss weight of this composite compared with the zno fe3o4 and mil 125 ti fig 6c it can be ascribed in association with the presence of zno fe3o4 groups on the surface of mil 125 ti and interaction between them correspondingly 53 3 6 magnetic properties the magnetic properties of the as prepared magnetic samples fe3o4 particles zno fe3o4 and zno fe3o4 tio2 composite were measured by the vibrating sample magnetometer method vsm at room temperature fig 6d the magnetic hysteresis loops of fe3o4 zno fe3o4 and zno fe3o4 tio2 confirmed that all samples were magnetics based on the vsm analysis the saturation value is 63 77 emu g 1 for fe3o4 particles 22 37 emu g 1 and 23 95 emu g 1 were obtained for the zno fe3o4 and zno fe3o4 tio2 respectively the reduction of magnetization properties in the zno fe3o4 tio2 composite was related to the existence of nonmagnetic particles tio2 derived from the mil 125 ti it confirmed that the final composite was successfully encapsulated with the zno fe3o4 particles moreover regarding the vsm curve which has an s like form the as synthesis magnetic composite comprising fe3o4 zno fe3o4 and zno fe3o4 tio2 possessed superparamagnetic properties at room temperature however they can be easily separated from an aqueous environment by performing an external magnetic field 44 the same result was reported by 51 who demonstrated the superparamagnetic nature of cu2o fe3o4 mil 101 fe which could easily be separated from water aqueous using a magnetic field 3 7 photocatalytic activity the photocatalytic efficiency of the as synthesized zno fe3o4 tio2 composite was analyzed by the degradation of rb21 aqueous solution in a quartz tube under uv irradiation 8 w lamp the decomposition rate was about 5 times greater than pure mil 125 ti suggesting the high photocatalytic ability of the zno fe3o4 tio2 composite data not shown in fig 7 a h the photodegradation of rb21 in the different operational conditions including the various ph initial dye concentration catalyst dosage and temperatures was studied in the photocatalytic process the ph of the solution plays an important role in the degradation of various organic pollutants 54 the amphoteric behavior of semiconductor oxidants is effective on the surface charges of the photocatalysts 55 therefore the effect of ph was investigated in the range of 2 9 with an initial dye concentration of 100 mg l 25 mg of photocatalyst at ambient temperature 25 c under uv light for 120 min however the adsorptions of rb21 dye on zno fe3o4 tio2 nanocomposite were conducted in dark conditions for 30 min to obtain the adsorption equilibrium the percentage of adsorbed rb21 dye after 30 min in dark condition was 19 96 22 22 14 44 17 76 3 10 2 25 4 50 and 3 80 at ph 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and 9 respectively the results showed that the pseudo first order according to the l h kinetic reaction is the model that gives the best fit for the rb21 dye degradation by zno fe3o4 tio2 nanocomposite with correlation coefficients r2 from 0 9572 to 0 9955 fig 7a the corresponding apparent rate constant k app values k app of rb21 oxidation of 0 552 0 342 0 174 0 174 0 138 0 156 0 132 and 0 150 min 1 were achieved at ph 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and 9 respectively fig 7b the results demonstrated that the degradation of rb21 in an acidic environment took place with higher efficiency than the alkaline and neutral region this means that acidic ph electrostatic interactions between reactive blue 21 anionic dye and positive zno fe3o4 tio2 results to enhanced adsorption percentage with a corresponding high rate of degradation a conclusion that can be drawn from aforementioned result is that the zno fe3o4 coated tio2 particles have positive charge in acidic solution while they have negative charge in alkaline solution as shown in fig 7a and b by increasing ph from acidic to alkaline the removal rate of dye decreased which was in agreement with 56 our results exhibited that the removal efficiency and the apparent rate constant values k app of about 80 20 and 0 552 min 1 respectively were achieved for rb21 dye at ph 2 by using 25 mg 100 ml zno fe3o4 tio2 composite the higher degradation of anionic rb21 dye under acidic and lower under alkaline conditions was elucidated in greater detail by the above phenomenon there is stated that by increasing the ph from 5 to 11 the degradation efficiency of the pollutant decreased due to the reduction of the interactions between photocatalyst and pollutant the effect of ph can be explained by the interaction between h species and the surface load of the zno fe3o4 tio2 nanocomposite in acidic phs the surface of the photocatalyst has a positive charge and h radicals act as strong oxidants 57 our result was in agreement with the previous reports 58 59 furthermore the proposed photocatalytic reaction mechanism for the degradation of rb21 is as follows 60 61 a generation of electron hole pairs

21 dye oh mineralized products the effect of catalyst dosage changes on the rb21 removal efficiency is shown in fig 7c and d as shown with increasing the photocatalyst dosage from 10 to 30 mg the photocatalytic activity increased which can be explained as follows the presence of more photocatalyst particles in the dye solution leads to the turbidity enhancement that reduces the photocatalytic activities 62 the obtained results elucidated that by increasing the photocatalyst dosage the amount of dye removal from the aqueous solution increased this is because providing extensive surface area and more active sites to adsorb dye molecules 56 this is to be noted that the adsorption portion of the dye molecule on the catalyst surface may play an important role in photocatalytic activity although as mentioned above the adsorption was not noticeable at all ph values however based on adsorption amount and suitable pore radius of zno fe3o4 tio2 nanocomposite fig 6b the dye molecule migrated inside the pore of zno fe3o4 tio2 nanocomposite reached good dispersion which may result in a good photocatalytic activity it is noteworthy to mention that the increase of catalyst dosage was not illustrated a positive effect on dye molecule adsorption at doses higher than 30 mg hence it could be inferred that the optimum dosage at the applied condition was 30 mg and at the higher catalyst concentration the increase of aqueous turbidity possessed a negative effect on the photocatalytic activities in this condition the catalyst overdosage prevented the photocatalyst particles from hitting influenced by the received light photons 63 the pseudo first order reaction according to the l h kinetic model was the best fit for the rb21 dye degradation by zno fe3o4 tio2 nanocomposite with correlation coefficients r2 from 0 9617 to 0 9960 fig 7c however the maximum rb21 removal efficiency of about 65 36 was attained at 30 mg 100 ml of zno fe3o4 tio2 composite correspondingly we predicted an apparent rate constant of 0 27 min 1 from the nonlinear behavior l h model fig 7d our results are also in good agreement with other literature works for a similar type of photocatalyst the initial concentration of rb21 is another effective parameter in photocatalytic reactions based on the literature 64 by increasing the dye concentration the decolorization rate constant k app decreases this effect can be ascribed to two different mechanisms first at the high concentrations of rb21 active sites may be occupied by the dye ions that reduce the production of free radicals on the catalyst surface 65 second at high concentrations as well the input photons absorb by the dye molecules and do not collide with the photocatalytic particles hence the photocatalytic degradation efficiency decreases consequently 62 in this study concentrations of 50 100 150 and 200 mg l at ph 3 temperature 25 and photocatalyst dosage 0 3 g of rb21 were analyzed for 120 min under uvc light our results exhibited that the removal percentages of about 76 38 65 36 50 27 and 32 52 were achieved for rb21 concentrations of 50 100 150 and 200 mg l respectively fig 7 e and f demonstrated that the high value of correlation coefficients r2 from 0 9897 to 9952 agreed that the degradation data were fitted well with pseudo first order reaction according to the l h kinetic model however the percentage of adsorbed rb21 dye after 30 min in dark condition was 16 01 16 61 12 98 and 10 74 at the rb21 dye concentration of 50 100 150 and 200 mg l respectively according to the results with increasing the concentration of dye the removal efficiency was decreased it can be due to the reduction of free radical production arising from the photocatalyst application similar results were reported for the degradation of a β lactam drug cefixime from an aqueous solution with swcnt zno fe3o4 heterojunction nanocomposite by 40 furthermore because of rb21 concentration increment the overall amount of adsorbed input uv radiations by the dye molecules increased 55 the temperature effects on the photocatalyst removal efficiencies were analyzed in the range from 15 to 45 c under constant conditions of other parameters fig 7g and h nevertheless the high value of r2 from 0 9897 to 9952 agreed that the data were fitted well with the pseudo first order l h kinetic model for rb21 dye degradation the adsorbed amount of rb21 dye was predicted during the dark condition for 30 min to reach the equilibrium the amount of adsorbed rb21 dye was 19 20 16 61 15 42 and 12 88 at the temperature of 15 25 35 and 45 c respectively our results demonstrated that the photocatalytic activity of the zno fe3o4 tio2 composite is influenced by the reaction temperature the apparent rate constant values k app of photocatalytic oxidation of 0 081 0 186 0 240 and 0 366 min 1 were achieved for temperature 15 25 35 and 45 c respectively correspondingly the maximum removal of 68 87 was obtained at temperature 45 c explaining direct oxidation through the photogenerated valence band holes 66 and the recombination of charge carriers e h is enhanced on the other hand this temperature is considered the best temperature for effective photolysis of rb21 dye structure given this with temperature increasing the electron hole recombination e h and viscosity of the solution decreased resulting in the increment of mobility and diffusion of molecules thus the rate of photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants increased correspondingly 67 3 8 thermodynamic studies based on the results the photocatalytic reaction of the zno fe3o4 tio2 composite for rb21 degradation followed a pseudo first order kinetic with the maximum removal efficiency at 45 c the arrhenius and eyring plots by the application of zno fe3o4 tio2 at the different temperatures are plotted in fig 8 besides the kinetic and activation parameters of zno fe3o4 tio2 are demonstrated in table 2 according to the results the positive value of enthalpy of activation δ h demonstrated that the photocatalytic process was endothermic in nature due to the electrostatic interaction between the hydrophobic species on the photocatalyst surface and organic pollutants it should be highlighted that the negative activation entropy change value δ s showed that the interaction between potential determining ions with the active surface sites was less hydrated at the solid liquid interface 37 according to table 2 the observed values of δ h and δ s were 34 17 kj mol 1 and 0 214 kj mol 1 k respectively moreover the activated complex values of δ g were computed at the temperatures 288 298 308 and 318 k equal to 95 80 97 93 100 07 102 21 kj mol 1 respectively table 2 the positive value of gibbs free energy of activation δ g 0 at all temperatures and the increment trend of δ g with the increase of temperature illustrated that the rb21 degradation process was nonspontaneous besides the other corresponding parameters such as ea 36 68 kj mol 1 and r2 0 9500 were calculated for the photodegradation process of rb21 by zno fe3o4 tio2 catalyst application table 2 however the temperature effects from 15 to 45 c were investigated 3 9 reusability experiments the reusability of as synthesized zno fe3o4 tio2 composite was investigated at a constant condition ph 3 initial dye concentration 50 mg l catalyst dose 30 mg at ambient temperature as shown in fig 9 after ending the first reaction the catalyst was aggregated with an external magnetic field and dried at 70 c for 12 h and then used for the second run the result revealed that after 5 cycles the photocatalytic efficiency of the zno fe3o4 tio2 composite was higher than 95 with no significant decrease during the successive runs further analysis also demonstrated that the photocatalytic activity of zno fe3o4 tio2 was considerably enhanced in comparison with its structural components i e the mil 125 ti zno fe3o4 and zno given these results the zno fe3o4 tio2 derived from the mil 125 ti could be effectively utilized as a useful photocatalyst under uv irradiation for the degradation of rb21 however the stability of the zno fe3o4 tio2 composite under successive practical runs confirmed that it can be proposed as a promising composite in the wastewater treatment process from an economic perspective finally the zno fe3o4 tio2 composite photocatalysts demonstrated well stability with no drastic decrement efficiency 5 which is considered from a practical point of view furthermore with aim of scale up production in the future and motivating the interest of industry owners the potential regenerability and cost effectiveness properties of the final photocatalyst may be at the heat of consideration 4 conclusion the synthesis of novel and efficient zno fe3o4 tio2 heterostructure is proposed through a solvo hydrothermal method towards the removal of rb21 from aqueous solutions in this study the results elucidated the contribution of functional groups i e zn o ti o and fe o in the tailoring of the zno fe3o4 tio2 structure furthermore by going forward from the mil 125 ti to the zno fe3o4 tio2 formation through succeeding processes the mesoporosity and mean pore diameter developed and thermal stability significantly increased as desired properties with positive impacts on the zno fe3o4 tio2 photocatalytic activities according to the optimization process the removal efficiency potential of zno fe3o4 tio2 was considerably enhanced 95 in acidic ph and high temperatures 45 c the thermodynamic investigation also revealed that the rb21 reduction from an aqueous solution was taken place through nonspontaneous and exothermic processes besides after five successive catalytic cycles the synthesized zno fe3o4 tio2 elucidated 95 of its initial removal potential indicating its notable efficiency from a practical perspective summing up the synthesized zno fe3o4 tio2 can be recommended as a promising

13063,the roles of zncl2 and fecl3 in preparing carbon materials from corn stover for efficient removal of cr vi from wastewater were investigated in the present study zncl2 activation created micropore and defective graphite structures to produce a high sbet of carbon materials 1409 7 m2 g with abundant active adsorption sites fecl3 activation promoted the formation of fe3o4 and fe2zno4 on carbon materials which exhibited potential magnetic separation properties the zn fe activated carbon materials csm zn fe 2 2 1 showed the maximum cr vi removal of 185 8 mg g the process for the removal of cr vi from wastewater fitted well with pseudo second order kinetics and langmuir models a reduction mechanism of cr vi removal from wastewater by zn fe activated carbon was discovered in this study pore adsorption electrostatic interaction and chemical interactions were found to play important roles in the adsorption of cr vi onto the carbon materials the c c c o groups in the carbon materials originating from zncl2 activation promoted the reduction of cr vi to cr iii followed by re adsorption on carbon materials and release to the solution which was found to significantly enhance cr vi removal these findings helped achieve the valorization of waste biomass to produce high performance carbon materials for treating cr vi containing wastewater in engineering applications graphic abstract the roles of zncl2 and fecl3 in preparing corn stover based carbon materials for cr vi containing wastewater treatment unlabelled image keywords zn fe activated carbon material corn stover chromium containing wastewater treatment reduction removal mechanism 1 introduction the overexploitation and consumption of fossil fuels have exacerbated the energy crisis and have caused serious environmental problems 1 biomass as a carbon source is a promising renewable alternative to petroleum 2 one of the most important ways to utilize biomass is to produce biochar by thermal processing e g pyrolysis under oxygen limited conditions 3 4 biochar is a preferred carbon material with multiple functions in wastewater treatment soil remediation and carbon sequestration 5 8 cheng et al reported that co2 emissions could be reduced by 738 million tons when equal quantities of coal are replaced by biochar 1 therefore the effective utilization of biomass to produce biochar is significant to achieve cleaner production and sustainable development with the gradual increase in industrialization the accompanying water pollution has become an urgent issue significantly affecting human health currently there are various pollutants present in water including pesticides dye molecules drug residues and heavy metals 9 15 among these contaminants heavy metals such as chromium are a major threat to water resources wastewater containing chromium is generally discharged from leather textile dyeing electroplating and stainless steel industries 3 16 in natural environments chromium can exist in two forms trivalent chromium cr iii and hexavalent chromium cr vi cr vi a highly diffusive and well known carcinogen is more hazardous than cr iii if cr vi containing wastewater is out of control serious environmental and health problems are bound to occur 17 18 it is reported that adsorption is an easy economic and efficient method for the removal of cr vi from wastewater 9 16 among a variety of adsorbents including silicate mesoporous materials clay minerals biosorbents and carbon materials biochar has been considered as the competitive approach with advantages of low cost and easy operation for treating cr vi containing wastewater 19 25 however due to the underdeveloped pore structure and limited adsorption sites the application of biochar for treating cr vi containing wastewater is restricted therefore further improvement in the capacity of biochar presents unique challenges and opportunities chemical activation is an efficient method to improve the performance of biochar for contaminant treatment 26 the most used chemical activation agents include metal chlorides zncl2 or fecl3 alkalis koh or k2co3 and h3po4 26 28 as a promising activation agent zncl2 has received much attention from researchers because it plays a positive role in increasing the surface area porosity and active functional groups of biochar 29 30 it has also been shown that the activation of biochar by fecl3 could create a magnetic property which enabled easy recovery of the used biochar 31 32 therefore some researchers have attempted to synthesize biochar doped by iron and zinc using zncl2 and fecl3 as active agents zn fe doped biochar have exhibited better performance in removing heavy metals 3 33 35 wang et al reported that zn fe doped biochar from sawdust exhibited high removal of p nitrophenol and lead at low concentrations 33 tan et al synthesized a novel zn fe doped biochar kb zn fe from kiwi branch and found that it had a maximum pb ii removal of 161 29 mg g 3 yu et al reported that zn fe doped biochar fe zn hbc displayed high cr vi removal 138 89 mg g 34 however the capacity of biochar to remove cr vi from wastewater must be improved furthermore these studies mainly focused on the adsorption behavior of zn fe doped biochar for the removal of heavy metals however the roles of zncl2 and fecl3 in preparing carbon materials for the efficient removal of cr vi from wastewater efficiently were ignored and thus require further investigation as one of the main agricultural wastes approximately 300 million tons of corn stover are produced per year in china 36 a lack of viable utilization modes leads to open burning of corn stover resulting in severe atmospheric pollution and loss of valuable resources converting corn stover into carbon materials for the removal of cr vi from wastewater can be an environmentally friendly and a sustainable practice in this study high performance carbon materials prepared from corn stover with simultaneous activation of zncl2 and fecl3 were successfully applied to treat cr vi containing wastewater the investigation focused on studying the roles of zncl2 and fecl3 in preparing corn stover based carbon materials for treating cr vi containing wastewater additionally the treatment mechanisms of cr vi containing wastewater including adsorption kinetics models and adsorption isotherms of zn fe activated carbon materials were discussed this guides the understanding of the mechanism of cr vi removal from wastewater efficiently and preparing high performance carbon materials by the valorization of waste biomass for treating cr vi containing wastewater in engineering applications 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the corn stover was harvested from chucheng city shandong province china before use the corn stover was crushed to obtain 20 mesh powder zinc chloride zncl2 ar 98 0 general reagent shanghai china ferric chloride fecl3 ar 98 0 damas beta shanghai china and potassium dichromate k2cr2o7 ar 99 8 jinshan fossil co ltd chengdu china were obtained from commercial sources and used as is 2 2 preparation of carbon materials by zn fe activation of corn stover corn stover cs powder was firstly carbonized in a furnace from room temperature to 200 800 c for 4 h to obtain biochar under nitrogen n2 80 ml min the heating rate was set at 5 c min and the obtained biochar was denoted as cs t where t is the temperature based on the experimental results cs 350 was selected as a carbonaceous precursor to prepare carbon materials using fecl3 and zncl2 as the active agents zn fe activation typically 2 g cs 350 and different proportions of fecl3 and zncl2 were mixed in water the mixture was ultrasonicated for 30 min and was maintained for 12 h at room temperature subsequently it was dried at 105 c in an oven the dried samples were placed in a quartz boat and activated by increasing the temperature to the desired value for different times a heating rate of 5 c min under n2 80 ml

zncl2 cs 350 was activated by the single fecl3 and zncl2 respectively using the procedure described above the fecl3 and zncl2 contents used were the same as in the preparation of csm zn fe 2 2 1 and the obtained carbon materials were named csm fe and csm zn respectively when fecl3 and zncl2 contents were the same as those used for the preparation of csn zn fe 1 1 1 the obtained carbon materials were denoted as csn fe and csn zn respectively two types of systems using different proportions of fecl3 and zncl2 were presented by m and n respectively 2 3 process for treating cr vi containing wastewater with carbon materials carbon 0 1 g was added to 50 ml of cr vi containing wastewater the cr vi concentration was set at 100 mg l before use the ph of the wastewater containing cr vi was lowered to 2 using hcl the mixture was placed in a shaker and shook constantly at a speed of 150 rpm at 30 c for various durations after filtration the obtained solution was used to measure the total cr and cr vi contents while the used carbon materials were collected for further analysis wastewater with cr vi concentrations of 100 400 mg l was also treated with zn fe activated carbon to investigate the maximum cr vi removal 2 4 investigation of adsorption kinetics and isotherms the experiments were carried out using 0 1 g zn fe activated carbon and 50 ml cr vi containing wastewater having cr vi concentrations of 300 and 400 mg l the reaction was performed at 30 c for 330 mins with a stirring speed of 150 rpm the cr vi content in wastewater was measured after treatment with carbon materials for a certain time to study adsorption kinetics using three model formulae listed below e g pseudo first order pseudo second order and intraparticle diffusion models 37 1 pseudo first

heterogeneity kf is the freundlich affinity coefficient mg1 n mln g 1 and ce is the concentration of cr vi at equilibrium 2 5 characterization of carbon materials the proximate analysis of samples including the contents of moisture volatiles and ash was performed based on the work of hassan et al 39 the fixed carbon content was calculated as 100 minus the content of moisture volatiles and ash the removal of methylene blue amethylene blue and iodine aiodine by different carbon materials were measured using ultraviolet visible spectroscopy dr 3900 hach usa at 665 nm and a chemical titration method respectively 38 40 elemental analyses of c h and n contents were performed using a vario eliii elemental analyzer elementar germany and the o content was calculated as follows o 100 moisture volatile ash x ray diffraction analysis xrd was performed on an x pert pro mpd diffractometer panalytical holland which used cu kα rays and a 40 kv tube voltage a fourier transform infrared spectrometer ft ir thermo scientific nicolet is20 thermo fisher usa was used to analyze the chemical functional groups of the carbon materials raman spectra of the different carbon materials were collected using a raman microscope xprora plus horiba france a linear polarized laser with a wavelength of 532 nm and a wavenumber of 2000 100 cm 1 were performed the n2 adsorption experiment was performed using a micro asap2460 instrument usa at 196 c to obtain the specific surface area and pore size of the carbon materials before the analysis the carbon materials were degassed under vacuum at 120 c for 2 h and then increased to 300 c for 2 h a scanning electron microscope sem phenom pharos 20 135 phenom scientific holland was used to obtain the surface images of the carbon materials the chemical composition and distribution of elements in the carbon materials were analyzed using energy dispersive x ray spectrometry eds zeta potential of the carbon materials dispersed in aqueous solutions with a ph of 2 were measured using a uk malvern zs90 zeta potential analyzer x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analysis of the carbon materials using al kα x ray radiation was performed on an axis ultra dld spectrometer kratos uk the c 1s peak of 284 6 ev was used for internal calibration of the energy scale the actual elements loading of the carbon materials were analyzed by icp oes optima 8000 perkinelmer usa before the analysis the carbon materials were digested using an acid solution containing hydrofluoric acid and nitrohydrochloric acid 2 6 chromium removal measurements the 1 5 diphenyl carbohydrazide spectrophotometric method was used to measure the cr vi content in wastewater which was performed at a wavelength of 540 nm using a dr3900 instrument hach usa to measure the total cr content cr iii present in the wastewater was first oxidized to cr vi with potassium permanganate and then the cr vi content was measured using the same method the cr iii content was the difference between the total cr and the cr iii contents 3 results and discussions 3 1 nature of carbonaceous precursor the results of the proximate analysis and elemental analysis of the solid samples obtained at different temperatures via carbonization are presented in table 1 the content of volatile components gradually decreased while the fixed carbon content increased with increasing temperature the elemental c content significantly increased from 43 44 for raw corn stover to 70 69 for cs 800 when the temperature increased to 800 c while the h content decreased from 1 68 to 0 28 the n content was low in the raw corn stover therefore minimal change in n content was observed in the biochar prepared at various carbonization temperatures this was accompanied by a large reduction in the o content from 49 90 in raw corn stover to 20 82 in cs 800 these changes resulted in a decrease in the h c and o c atomic ratios with increasing carbonization temperature this indicates that high temperatures produced biochar with high aromaticity and carbonization degrees 41 this was consistent with the solid residues becoming darker as the temperature increased fig s1 chromaticity removal is an important issue in the treatment of cr vi containing wastewater iodine removal is a key index to determine the adsorption capacity of carbon materials for treating cr vi containing wastewater therefore the removal of methylene blue amethylene blue and iodine aiodine as key indicators were firstly used to evaluate the adsorption behavior of the carbon materials it was found that the amethylene blue of the biochar prepared at various temperatures was almost zero and the a iodine was lower than 450 mg g this suggests that biochar made with the direct carbonization even at high temperatures is not an ideal adsorption material it has been reported that the chemical activation method has great potential for improving the properties of biochar in the adsorption field 28 considering that cs 350 possessed a higher carbonization degree with lower h c 0 80 and o c 0 31 ratios it was selected as the carbonaceous precursor to prepare high performance carbon materials via chemical activation 3 2 zncl2 and fecl3 activation produced high performance carbon materials several typical activation agents such as k2co3 koh mgcl2 fecl3 and zncl2 were used to activate cs 350 to improve the removal of methylene blue and iodine among these activation agents it was found that zncl2 as an activation agent exhibited better performance on removing methylene blue and iodine fig 1 a and b fecl3 was found to be a promising agent for preparing magnetic carbon materials which are recoverable from solutions 31 fecl3 and zncl2 were also simultaneously used as activation agents zn fe activation it was found that the amethylene blue and aiodine of csn zn fe 1 1 1 71 2 and 671 8 mg g were much higher than those of csn zn 29 4 and 632 9 mg g and csn fe 15 1 and 195 2 mg g similarly csm zn fe 2 2 1 showed better performance in removing methylene blue and iodine than csm zn and csmfe therefore zn fe activation of cs 350 is efficient for preparing carbon materials with high methylene blue and iodine removing abilities the effects of zncl2 fecl3 mass ratios on the removal of methylene blue and iodine were further studied fig 1 c and d and the results showed that zncl2 activation plays a critical role in improving the capacities of carbon materials for removing methylene blue and iodine while fecl3 activation helps to enhance their removal among the prepared carbon materials csm zn fe 2 2 1 exhibited the highest amethylene blue 219 6 mg g and aiodine 1043 2 mg g additionally the effects of activation temperature and time on the removal of methylene blue and iodine by csm zn fe 2 2 1 were studied and it was confirmed that the optimal activation conditions were 500 c for 2 h fig s2 3 3 treatment of cr vi containing wastewater by different carbon materials presence of highly toxic heavy metals such as cr vi in wastewater has proven to be a major threat and there have been several human health and ecosystem problems associated with it based on the above results higher adsorption of carbon materials can be achieved by zn fe activation therefore different zn fe activated carbon materials were used to treat wastewater containing 100 mg l cr vi as shown in fig 1 e in the first 10 min cr vi removal reached 83 9 for csn zn fe 1 1 1 and it further increased to 93 9 after 30 min the csn zn prepared using the same amount of zncl2 as used for the preparation of csn zn fe 1 1 1 removed 63 7 and 79 0 cr vi after 10 and 60 mins respectively when treated with csn fe which was prepared using an equal amount of fecl3 as that used in the preparation of csn zn fe 1 1 1 only 8 8 cr vi was removed in 10 min even when the treatment time was prolonged to 120 mins the removal reached only 21 2 which was markedly lower when compared to the treatment with csn zn and csn zn fe 1 1 1 csm zn fe 2 2 1 also exhibited a higher cr vi removal than csm zn and csmfe this further confirmed that zn fe activation could enhance the removal of cr vi after treatment with csm zn fe 2 2 1 96 0 cr vi was removed in the first 10 min which was higher than that of csn zn fe 1 1 1 83 9 higher removal of cr vi was obtained after treatment with csm zn and csm fe compared to that csn zn and csn fe respectively these results suggest that an increased zncl2 fecl3 mass ratio and activating agent content could enhance cr vi removal from wastewater wastewater containing different cr vi concentrations 100 400 mg l were also tested with csm zn fe 2 2 1 as shown in fig 1 f a prolonged duration was found to promote cr vi removal at different concentrations a longer duration is required to remove higher concentrations of cr vi from wastewater for treating wastewater containing 400 mg l cr vi 92 9 cr vi was removed within 330 min fig 2 a therefore the maximum cr vi removal could reach 185 8 mg g which was higher than that reported in the literature 26 1 142 9 mg g 31 34 42 the adsorption kinetics of treating wastewater containing 400 mg l of cr vi by csm zn fe 2 2 1 was further investigated using three models e g pseudo first order pseudo second order and intra particle diffusion models to fit the data of cr vi removal a higher correlation coefficient of pseudo second order r2 0 9948 was obtained compared to that of the pseudo first order adsorption model r2 0 9669 this indicates that the process for treating cr vi containing wastewater followed with pseudo second order model which was mainly controlled by chemisorption 31 37 after treatment with csm zn fe 2 2 1 the intraparticle diffusion model was used to study the diffusion mechanism of cr vi removal from wastewater the data exhibited two linear plots demonstrating that two steps were required to remove cr vi from the wastewater fig 2 d cr diffused to the surface of the carbon materials at the beginning and then cr diffused towards the pores the second step did not pass through the origin indicating that both intra particle diffusion and chemical adsorption were the rate controlling factors for removing cr vi from wastewater 43 44 two langmuir s and freundlich s isotherm models were employed to fit the adsorption process as shown in fig 2 e and f compared to the freundlich model the langmuir model with a higher r2 values of 0 9506 better explained the adsorption data this implies that cr vi removal from wastewater was controlled by a single layer of chemisorption 45 after treating wastewater containing 300 mg l cr vi with csm zn fe 2 2 1 the adsorption kinetics and isotherms were also investigated and the results were similar to those obtained for 400 mg l cr vi solution fig 2 therefore the process for treating cr vi containing wastewater using csm zn fe 2 2 1 was mainly controlled via monolayer chemisorption supported by the pseudo second order kinetics and the langmuir model 3 4 roles of fecl3 and zncl2 in producing high performance carbon materials to further study the roles of fecl3 and zncl2 in the preparation of carbon materials with high performance bet analysis of carbon materials obtained after different amounts of fecl3 and zncl2 activation were performed fig 3 and table 2 in the range of the tested relative pressures fig 3 a csn fe and csm fe showed parallel adsorption and desorption branches indicating the existence of slit shaped pores 28 after treatment with zncl2 csn zn and csm zn exhibited type i isotherms with closed adsorption and desorption branches indicating the presence of micropores fig 3 b after simultaneous zn fe activation csn zn fe 1 1 1 and csm zn fe 2 2 1 exhibited isotherms similar to that activated with zncl2 alone fig 3 c this suggests that zncl2 plays a vital role in forming porous structures the csn zn fe 1 1 1 and csm zn fe 2 2 1 obtained by zn fe activation showed a significant increase in nitrogen uptake over the entire tested pressure range compared to the carbon materials prepared with a single activating agent fig 3 c this indicates zn fe activation enhances the adsorption capacity of the carbon materials the surface area of csn fe 48 8 m2 g and csm fe 59 8 m2 g were significantly lower than those of csn zn 486 5 m2 g and csm zn 1036 5 m2 g this might be ascribed to the fact that zinc salts as a dehydration reagent reacted with h and o in the carbon material thereby promoting pore formation 35 the surface area of the carbon materials increased dramatically after zn fe activation compared to that of carbon materials prepared with either zncl2 or fecl3 activation the prepared csm zn fe 2 2 1 achieved a higher surface area 1409 7 m2 g with a total pore volume of 0 714 cm3 g moreover an obvious increase in the proportion of micropore volume was observed after zncl2 activation and it was over 70 after zn fe activation according to the average pore size and pore size distribution plots table 2 and fig 3 d zn fe activated carbon contained both micropores and mesopores and micropores were predominant therefore zncl2 created a more microporous structure in the carbon and promoted a higher surface area of the carbon material with the help of fecl3 according to the sem images the corn stover had tight fibrous bundles without any porous channels and slits figs 4 a and s3 after fecl3 activation it was difficult to observe the formation of pores figs 4 b and s3 c the ordered tunnel shape pores constructed honeycomb like structure was observed after zncl2 activation while the shape of fibrous bundlers remained intact fig 4 c a similar phenomenon was observed after the zn fe activation fig 4 d suggesting that zncl2 exhibited better performance in controlling activation to produce hierarchical tunnel shaped pores the eds spectra confirmed that fe and zn particles were presented on the csm zn fe 2 2 1 fig 4 f xrd analysis showed that iron and zinc species were mainly in the form of fe3o4 and fe2zno4 after zn fe activation fig 4 h 31 33 46 47 as shown in fig 4 i an ft ir characteristic peak at 476 cm 1 assigned to the feo vibration of fe3o4 was observed for csm zn fe 2 2 1 31 suggesting that the prepared carbon material have a potential magnetic property as shown in the raman spectra of different carbon materials fig 4 j and table s1 there were two characteristic peaks at around 1357 and 1590 cm 1 representing the disordered or defective graphite structure d peak and ordered graphene structures g peak respectively 48 compared to the cs 350 precursor 1 057 a lower id ig ratios of csm fe 0 990 and csm zn 0 997 were obtained indicating that more graphite structures were developed after activation whereas the csm zn showed a slightly higher id ig value than csm fe suggesting that zncl2 was beneficial for the development of defective graphite structures 49 this finding was consistent with the bet results which showed that zncl2 activation produced carbon materials with a larger surface area the id ig ratio of csm zn fe 2 2 1 increased to 0 998 compared to those of csm zn 0 997 and csm fe 0 990 suggesting that zn fe activation enhanced the formation of defective graphite structures 3 5 possible mechanism for treating cr vi containing wastewater to study the mechanism of treating cr vi containing wastewater with carbon materials zeta potential of three different carbon materials csm zn fe 2 2 1 csmzn and csmfe was measured all three types of carbon materials exhibit positive zeta potentials the chromium has been reported in the form of cr2o7 and hcro4 at a ph of 2 34 this suggests that electrostatic attraction exists between the cr vi anions and positively charged carbon materials compared to the other two carbon materials csm fe had a lower zeta potential 4 65 mv with low efficiency in removing cr vi from wastewater the zeta potential of csm zn fe 2 2 1 was 12 5 mv remarkably close to that of csm zn 12 4 mv while csm zn fe 2 2 1 showed a higher removal of cr vi than csm zn indicating that electrostatic attraction was not the only factor for treating cr vi containing wastewater efficiently compared to csm zn and csm fe a larger surface area and rich pores of csm zn fe 2 2 1 were observed based on the bet and sem results table 2 and fig 4 which could increase the number of active adsorption sites compared to the diameter of cr 0 28 nm csm zn fe 2 2 1 had significantly larger pores with a size of 2 03 nm therefore pore adsorption could also be a factor that enhanced cr vi removal by zn fe activation additionally the ft ir characteristic peaks at 1569 1258 and 1365 cm 1 obviously increased for csm zn fe 2 2 1 after treating cr vi containing wastewater fig 4 i liu et al 2021 reported that the ft ir peaks at 800 1400 cm 1 could be assigned to the stretching vibration of ch or c o c 49 yin et al reported that the ft ir peak at 1569 cm 1 was attributable to the stretching vibration of cooh 50 this suggested that the carbon oxygen containing functional groups in carbon materials are involved in treating cr vi containing wastewater this was also proven by the c1s and o1s xps spectra fig s4 a and b where they both increased and shifted after the treatment after treating the cr vi solution the peak at 476 cm 1 assigned to feo groups in the ft ir spectra increased and shifted and the fe 2p xps spectra also significantly decreased figs 4 i and s4 c implying that the feo groups also took part in cr vi removal via chemical interactions the d and g peaks in the raman spectra of csm zn fe 2 2 1 decreased significantly after treatment with cr vi containing wastewater fig 4 j the id ig ratio of used csm zn fe 2 2 1 increased to 1 035 compared to that untreated cr vi containing wastewater 0 998 proving that the graphite structure was affected table s1 the pore walls of csm zn fe 2 2 1 in the sem images became rough possibly because of the adsorbed cr ions from the wastewater fig 4 e 51 in the xps spectra fig 5 a two peaks between 560 and 600 ev assigned to cr2p were observed 31 suggesting that cr was adsorbed by csm zn fe 2 2 1 the sem eds results confirmed that the cr was distributed on csm zn fe 2 2 1 after treating cr vi containing wastewater however 77 4 of cr vi was reduced to cr iii in solution after treating wastewater containing 100 mg l cr vi by cs zn fe 2 2 1 for 120 min this suggests that cr vi removal was mainly due to the formation of cr iii by the reduction reaction and this cr iii was further released into the solution as displayed in fig 5 the c1s xps spectra could be fitted with four peaks at binding energies of 284 6 286 1 287 4 and 289 3 ev corresponding to cc c oh co and cooh respectively 32 after treating cr vi containing wastewater with csm zn fe 2 2 1 the relative concentrations of cc and co decreased from 76 6 and 3 9 to 63 0 and 1 7 respectively the relative concentration of the peaks assigned to c oh and cooh increased from 11 2 and 8 4 to 24 3 and 11 0 respectively table s2 the deconvolution of the o 1s xps spectra gave three peaks at 530 3 531 2 and 532 9 ev representing the co c oh and cooh groups respectively 32 the co content decreased from 27 4 to 22 8 while those of c oh and cooh increased from 51 2 and 21 4 and 54 8 and 22 3 respectively following treatment with cr vi containing wastewater table s3 this suggests that the cc and co groups contained in the carbon materials were oxidized in the process of treating cr vi containing wastewater thus their relative contents decreased according to the ftir raman and xps results it was speculated that the cc and co groups in the carbon materials acted as electron donors and participated in the reduction of cr vi to cr iii while the c oh and cooh groups had chemical interactions with cr vi to further study the roles of fecl3 and zncl2 in activating carbon materials for treating cr vi containing wastewater the cr iii content in aqueous solutions following treatment with csm zn and csm fe at various times was analyzed as shown in fig 5 f and g it was found that the proportion of cr iii in the solution was relatively low in the first 10 min compared to cr vi removal after treatment with csm zn and csm fe cr iii proportion gradually increased with prolonging time from 10 to 120 min for example more than 85 of cr vi was removed in the first 10 min after treatment with csm zn and the cr vi removal increased to 99 7 with prolonging time to 120 mins while the proportion of cr iii in the aqueous solution increased significantly from 39 9 to 82 8 with prolonging time to 120 mins therefore cr vi was first adsorbed on the carbon materials owing to electrostatic attraction pore adsorption and chemical interactions under acidic conditions the cr iii formed by the reduction of cr vi can be described as follows 30 1 hcro 4 7h 3e cr 3 4h 2 o 2 cr 2 o 7 2 14 h 6e 2cr 3 7h 2 o the carbon oxygen containing functional groups in carbons acted as electron donors whereas free hydrogen was provided by the acidic solution 51 the adsorbed cr vi was then reduced to form cr iii which was in turn released into solution via electrostatic repulsion 51 xps icp oes and sem eds results showed that a small amount of zn species existed on the prepared csm zn fe 2 2 1 figs 4 f s4 d and table s4 while it almost decreased to zero after the treatment of cr vi solution fig 4 g this suggests that a minimal quantity of cr iii in the solution could re adsorbed on the carbon materials owing to ion exchange with zinc ions 51 additionally 82 8 cr vi was reduced to cr iii when treated with csm zn for 120 min compared to when treated with csm fe 20 4 and csm zn fe 2 2 1 77 4 zncl2 activation in comparison to fecl3 activation increased the relative contents of c c c o groups in the carbon materials based on xps analysis tables s2 and s3 this suggested that carbon materials originating from zncl2 activation were beneficial for the reduction of cr vi to cr iii in wastewater treatment therefore the possible mechanism for treating cr vi containing wastewater using zn fe activated carbon materials is proposed fig 5 c it was found that electrostatic interaction pore adsorption and chemical interactions played important roles in the adsorption of cr vi on carbon materials this is consistent with most studies on the removal of cr vi from wastewater table 3 in addition to these mechanisms cr vi removal by reducing to cr iii has also been reported however the roles of zncl2 and fecl3 in preparing carbon materials for cr vi removal from wastewater via reduction reaction are still unclear in this study the c c c o groups in csm zn fe 2 2 1 originating from zncl2 activation were found to promote the reduction of adsorbed cr vi to cr iii which was then released into the aqueous solution as a result of electrostatic repulsion the carbon materials originating from fecl3 activation slightly inhibited the reduction of cr vi and the presence of feo groups enhanced the adsorption of cr vi on the carbon materials via chemical interactions after treatment with csm zn fe 2 2 1 for 120 min more than 75 of the cr vi was reduced to cr iii indicating that the reduction reaction was the key mechanism for treating cr vi containing wastewater efficiently to the best of our knowledge such findings have been seldom reported in the existing literature on cr vi containing wastewater treatment 34 42 these findings were driven by various mechanisms for treating cr vi containing wastewater efficiently using carbon materials guiding the production of high performance carbon materials from waste biomass by modulating zn fe activation 4 conclusions a high performance carbon material with a high sbet 1409 7 m2 g prepared by zn fe activation of corn stover was successfully used for treating cr vi containing wastewater with the maximum cr vi removal of 185 8 mg g zncl2 activation produced carbon materials with abundant active adsorption sites while fecl3 activation enhanced the magnetic properties of carbon materials the pseudo second order kinetics and langmuir models fit the process for treating cr vi containing wastewater well it was discovered that the cr vi was adsorbed on carbon materials via pore adsorption electrostatic interaction and chemical interactions and then the adsorbed cr vi reduced into cr iii and released in solution which significantly improved the efficiency of cr vi removal from

13063,the roles of zncl2 and fecl3 in preparing carbon materials from corn stover for efficient removal of cr vi from wastewater were investigated in the present study zncl2 activation created micropore and defective graphite structures to produce a high sbet of carbon materials 1409 7 m2 g with abundant active adsorption sites fecl3 activation promoted the formation of fe3o4 and fe2zno4 on carbon materials which exhibited potential magnetic separation properties the zn fe activated carbon materials csm zn fe 2 2 1 showed the maximum cr vi removal of 185 8 mg g the process for the removal of cr vi from wastewater fitted well with pseudo second order kinetics and langmuir models a reduction mechanism of cr vi removal from wastewater by zn fe activated carbon was discovered in this study pore adsorption electrostatic interaction and chemical interactions were found to play important roles in the adsorption of cr vi onto the carbon materials the c c c o groups in the carbon materials originating from zncl2 activation promoted the reduction of cr vi to cr iii followed by re adsorption on carbon materials and release to the solution which was found to significantly enhance cr vi removal these findings helped achieve the valorization of waste biomass to produce high performance carbon materials for treating cr vi containing wastewater in engineering applications graphic abstract the roles of zncl2 and fecl3 in preparing corn stover based carbon materials for cr vi containing wastewater treatment unlabelled image keywords zn fe activated carbon material corn stover chromium containing wastewater treatment reduction removal mechanism 1 introduction the overexploitation and consumption of fossil fuels have exacerbated the energy crisis and have caused serious environmental problems 1 biomass as a carbon source is a promising renewable alternative to petroleum 2 one of the most important ways to utilize biomass is to produce biochar by thermal processing e g pyrolysis under oxygen limited conditions 3 4 biochar is a preferred carbon material with multiple functions in wastewater treatment soil remediation and carbon sequestration 5 8 cheng et al reported that co2 emissions could be reduced by 738 million tons when equal quantities of coal are replaced by biochar 1 therefore the effective utilization of biomass to produce biochar is significant to achieve cleaner production and sustainable development with the gradual increase in industrialization the accompanying water pollution has become an urgent issue significantly affecting human health currently there are various pollutants present in water including pesticides dye molecules drug residues and heavy metals 9 15 among these contaminants heavy metals such as chromium are a major threat to water resources wastewater containing chromium is generally discharged from leather textile dyeing electroplating and stainless steel industries 3 16 in natural environments chromium can exist in two forms trivalent chromium cr iii and hexavalent chromium cr vi cr vi a highly diffusive and well known carcinogen is more hazardous than cr iii if cr vi containing wastewater is out of control serious environmental and health problems are bound to occur 17 18 it is reported that adsorption is an easy economic and efficient method for the removal of cr vi from wastewater 9 16 among a variety of adsorbents including silicate mesoporous materials clay minerals biosorbents and carbon materials biochar has been considered as the competitive approach with advantages of low cost and easy operation for treating cr vi containing wastewater 19 25 however due to the underdeveloped pore structure and limited adsorption sites the application of biochar for treating cr vi containing wastewater is restricted therefore further improvement in the capacity of biochar presents unique challenges and opportunities chemical activation is an efficient method to improve the performance of biochar for contaminant treatment 26 the most used chemical activation agents include metal chlorides zncl2 or fecl3 alkalis koh or k2co3 and h3po4 26 28 as a promising activation agent zncl2 has received much attention from researchers because it plays a positive role in increasing the surface area porosity and active functional groups of biochar 29 30 it has also been shown that the activation of biochar by fecl3 could create a magnetic property which enabled easy recovery of the used biochar 31 32 therefore some researchers have attempted to synthesize biochar doped by iron and zinc using zncl2 and fecl3 as active agents zn fe doped biochar have exhibited better performance in removing heavy metals 3 33 35 wang et al reported that zn fe doped biochar from sawdust exhibited high removal of p nitrophenol and lead at low concentrations 33 tan et al synthesized a novel zn fe doped biochar kb zn fe from kiwi branch and found that it had a maximum pb ii removal of 161 29 mg g 3 yu et al reported that zn fe doped biochar fe zn hbc displayed high cr vi removal 138 89 mg g 34 however the capacity of biochar to remove cr vi from wastewater must be improved furthermore these studies mainly focused on the adsorption behavior of zn fe doped biochar for the removal of heavy metals however the roles of zncl2 and fecl3 in preparing carbon materials for the efficient removal of cr vi from wastewater efficiently were ignored and thus require further investigation as one of the main agricultural wastes approximately 300 million tons of corn stover are produced per year in china 36 a lack of viable utilization modes leads to open burning of corn stover resulting in severe atmospheric pollution and loss of valuable resources converting corn stover into carbon materials for the removal of cr vi from wastewater can be an environmentally friendly and a sustainable practice in this study high performance carbon materials prepared from corn stover with simultaneous activation of zncl2 and fecl3 were successfully applied to treat cr vi containing wastewater the investigation focused on studying the roles of zncl2 and fecl3 in preparing corn stover based carbon materials for treating cr vi containing wastewater additionally the treatment mechanisms of cr vi containing wastewater including adsorption kinetics models and adsorption isotherms of zn fe activated carbon materials were discussed this guides the understanding of the mechanism of cr vi removal from wastewater efficiently and preparing high performance carbon materials by the valorization of waste biomass for treating cr vi containing wastewater in engineering applications 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the corn stover was harvested from chucheng city shandong province china before use the corn stover was crushed to obtain 20 mesh powder zinc chloride zncl2 ar 98 0 general reagent shanghai china ferric chloride fecl3 ar 98 0 damas beta shanghai china and potassium dichromate k2cr2o7 ar 99 8 jinshan fossil co ltd chengdu china were obtained from commercial sources and used as is 2 2 preparation of carbon materials by zn fe activation of corn stover corn stover cs powder was firstly carbonized in a furnace from room temperature to 200 800 c for 4 h to obtain biochar under nitrogen n2 80 ml min the heating rate was set at 5 c min and the obtained biochar was denoted as cs t where t is the temperature based on the experimental results cs 350 was selected as a carbonaceous precursor to prepare carbon materials using fecl3 and zncl2 as the active agents zn fe activation typically 2 g cs 350 and different proportions of fecl3 and zncl2 were mixed in water the mixture was ultrasonicated for 30 min and was maintained for 12 h at room temperature subsequently it was dried at 105 c in an oven the dried samples were placed in a quartz boat and activated by increasing the temperature to the desired value for different times a heating rate of 5 c min under n2 80 ml min was employed after activation the zn fe activated carbon materials were collected and washed with distilled water to attain a neutral ph the obtained carbon materials were dried and named cs zn fe x m n x is set as 1 and 2 representing the mass ratio of total activation agents to cs 350 m n is the zncl2 fecl3 mass ratio which is set to 0 5 1 1 1 2 1 and 3 1 to study the functions of fecl3 and zncl2 cs 350 was activated by the single fecl3 and zncl2 respectively using the procedure described above the fecl3 and zncl2 contents used were the same as in the preparation of csm zn fe 2 2 1 and the obtained carbon materials were named csm fe and csm zn respectively when fecl3 and zncl2 contents were the same as those used for the preparation of csn zn fe 1 1 1 the obtained carbon materials were denoted as csn fe and csn zn respectively two types of systems using different proportions of fecl3 and zncl2 were presented by m and n respectively 2 3 process for treating cr vi containing wastewater with carbon materials carbon 0 1 g was added to 50 ml of cr vi containing wastewater the cr vi concentration was set at 100 mg l before use the ph of the wastewater containing cr vi was lowered to 2 using hcl the mixture was placed in a shaker and shook constantly at a speed of 150 rpm at 30 c for various durations after filtration the obtained solution was used to measure the total cr and cr vi contents while the used carbon materials were collected for further analysis wastewater with cr vi concentrations of 100 400 mg l was also treated with zn fe activated carbon to investigate the maximum cr vi removal 2 4 investigation of adsorption kinetics and isotherms the experiments were carried out using 0 1 g zn fe activated carbon and 50 ml cr vi containing wastewater having cr vi concentrations of 300 and 400 mg l the reaction was performed at 30 c for 330 mins with a stirring speed of 150 rpm the cr vi content in wastewater was measured after treatment with carbon materials for a certain time to study adsorption kinetics using three model formulae listed below e g pseudo first order pseudo second order and intraparticle diffusion models 37 1 pseudo first

carbon langmuir and freundlich models were employed which are expressed as shown in eqs 4 and 5 below 38 4 langmuir model c e q e 1 k l q m c e q m 5 freundlich model ln q e ln k f 1 n ln c e where qm is the maximum amount of cr vi removed mg g qe is the amount of cr vi removed mg g at equilibrium kl is the langmuir fitting parameter ml mg n is a dimensionless number related to the surface heterogeneity kf is the freundlich affinity coefficient mg1 n mln g 1 and ce is the concentration of cr vi at equilibrium 2 5 characterization of carbon materials the proximate analysis of samples including the contents of moisture volatiles and ash was performed based on the work of hassan et al 39 the fixed carbon content was calculated as 100 minus the content of moisture volatiles and ash the removal of methylene blue amethylene blue and iodine aiodine by different carbon materials were measured using ultraviolet visible spectroscopy dr 3900 hach usa at 665 nm and a chemical titration method respectively 38 40 elemental analyses of c h and n contents were performed using a vario eliii elemental analyzer elementar germany and the o content was calculated as follows o 100 moisture volatile ash x ray diffraction analysis xrd was performed on an x pert pro mpd diffractometer panalytical holland which used cu kα rays and a 40 kv tube voltage a fourier transform infrared spectrometer ft ir thermo scientific nicolet is20 thermo fisher usa was used to analyze the chemical functional groups of the carbon materials raman spectra of the different carbon materials were collected using a raman microscope xprora plus horiba france a linear polarized laser with a wavelength of 532 nm and a wavenumber of 2000 100 cm 1 were performed the n2 adsorption experiment was performed using a micro asap2460 instrument usa at 196 c to obtain the specific surface area and pore size of the carbon materials before the analysis the carbon materials were degassed under vacuum at 120 c for 2 h and then increased to 300 c for 2 h a scanning electron microscope sem phenom pharos 20 135 phenom scientific holland was used to obtain the surface images of the carbon materials the chemical composition and distribution of elements in the carbon materials were analyzed using energy dispersive x ray spectrometry eds zeta potential of the carbon materials dispersed in aqueous solutions with a ph of 2 were measured using a uk malvern zs90 zeta potential analyzer x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analysis of the carbon materials using al kα x ray radiation was performed on an axis ultra dld spectrometer kratos uk the c 1s peak of 284 6 ev was used for internal calibration of the energy scale the actual elements loading of the carbon materials were analyzed by icp oes optima 8000 perkinelmer usa before the analysis the carbon materials were digested using an acid solution containing hydrofluoric acid and nitrohydrochloric acid 2 6 chromium removal measurements the 1 5 diphenyl carbohydrazide spectrophotometric method was used to measure the cr vi content in wastewater which was performed at a wavelength of 540 nm using a dr3900 instrument hach usa to measure the total cr content cr iii present in the wastewater was first oxidized to cr vi with potassium permanganate and then the cr vi content was measured using the same method the cr iii content was the difference between the total cr and the cr iii contents 3 results and discussions 3 1 nature of carbonaceous precursor the results of the proximate analysis and elemental analysis of the solid samples obtained at different temperatures via carbonization are presented in table 1 the content of volatile components gradually decreased while the fixed carbon content increased with increasing temperature the elemental c content significantly increased from 43 44 for raw corn stover to 70 69 for cs 800 when the temperature increased to 800 c while the h content decreased from 1 68 to 0 28 the n content was low in the raw corn stover therefore minimal change in n content was observed in the biochar prepared at various carbonization temperatures this was accompanied by a large reduction in the o content from 49 90 in raw corn stover to 20 82 in cs 800 these changes resulted in a decrease in the h c and o c atomic ratios with increasing carbonization temperature this indicates that high temperatures produced biochar with high aromaticity and carbonization degrees 41 this was consistent with the solid residues becoming darker as the temperature increased fig s1 chromaticity removal is an important issue in the treatment of cr vi containing wastewater iodine removal is a key index to determine the adsorption capacity of carbon materials for treating cr vi containing wastewater therefore the removal of methylene blue amethylene blue and iodine aiodine as key indicators were firstly used to evaluate the adsorption behavior of the carbon materials it was found that the amethylene blue of the biochar prepared at various temperatures was almost zero and the a iodine was lower than 450 mg g this suggests that biochar made with the direct carbonization even at high temperatures is not an ideal adsorption material it has been reported that the chemical activation method has great potential for improving the properties of biochar in the adsorption field 28 considering that cs 350 possessed a higher carbonization degree with lower h c 0 80 and o c 0 31 ratios it was selected as the carbonaceous precursor to prepare high performance carbon materials via chemical activation 3 2 zncl2 and fecl3 activation produced high performance carbon materials several typical activation agents such as k2co3 koh mgcl2 fecl3 and zncl2 were used to activate cs 350 to improve the removal of methylene blue and iodine among these activation agents it was found that zncl2 as an activation agent exhibited better performance on removing methylene blue and iodine fig 1 a and b fecl3 was found to be a promising agent for preparing magnetic carbon materials which are recoverable from solutions 31 fecl3 and zncl2 were also simultaneously used as activation agents zn fe activation it was found that the amethylene blue and aiodine of csn zn fe 1 1 1 71 2 and 671 8 mg g were much higher than those of csn zn 29 4 and 632 9 mg g and csn fe 15 1 and 195 2 mg g similarly csm zn fe 2 2 1 showed better performance in removing methylene blue and iodine than csm zn and csmfe therefore zn fe activation of cs 350 is efficient for preparing carbon materials with high methylene blue and iodine removing abilities the effects of zncl2 fecl3 mass ratios on the removal of methylene blue and iodine were further studied fig 1 c and d and the results showed that zncl2 activation plays a critical role in improving the capacities of carbon materials for removing methylene blue and iodine while fecl3 activation helps to enhance their removal among the prepared carbon materials csm zn fe 2 2 1 exhibited the highest amethylene blue 219 6 mg g and aiodine 1043 2 mg g additionally the effects of activation temperature and time on the removal of methylene blue and iodine by csm zn fe 2 2 1 were studied and it was confirmed that the optimal activation conditions were 500 c for 2 h fig s2 3 3 treatment of cr vi containing wastewater by different carbon materials presence of highly toxic heavy metals such as cr vi in wastewater has proven to be a major threat and there have been several human health and ecosystem problems associated with it based on the above results higher adsorption of carbon materials can be achieved by zn fe activation therefore different zn fe activated carbon materials were used to treat wastewater containing 100 mg l cr vi as shown in fig 1 e in the first 10 min cr vi removal reached 83 9 for csn zn fe 1 1 1 and it further increased to 93 9 after 30 min the csn zn prepared using the same amount of zncl2 as used for the preparation of csn zn fe 1 1 1 removed 63 7 and 79 0 cr vi after 10 and 60 mins respectively when treated with csn fe which was prepared using an equal amount of fecl3 as that used in the preparation of csn zn fe 1 1 1 only 8 8 cr vi was removed in 10 min even when the treatment time was prolonged to 120 mins the removal reached only 21 2 which was markedly lower when compared to the treatment with csn zn and csn zn fe 1 1 1 csm zn fe 2 2 1 also exhibited a higher cr vi removal than csm zn and csmfe this further confirmed that zn fe activation could enhance the removal of cr vi after treatment with csm zn fe 2 2 1 96 0 cr vi was removed in the first 10 min which was higher than that of csn zn fe 1 1 1 83 9 higher removal of cr vi was obtained after treatment with csm zn and csm fe compared to that csn zn and csn fe respectively these results suggest that an increased zncl2 fecl3 mass ratio and activating agent content could enhance cr vi removal from wastewater wastewater containing different cr vi concentrations 100 400 mg l were also tested with csm zn fe 2 2 1 as shown in fig 1 f a prolonged duration was found to promote cr vi removal at different concentrations a longer duration is required to remove higher concentrations of cr vi from wastewater for treating wastewater containing 400 mg l cr vi 92 9 cr vi was removed within 330 min fig 2 a therefore the maximum cr vi removal could reach 185 8 mg g which was higher than that reported in the literature 26 1 142 9 mg g 31 34 42 the adsorption kinetics of treating wastewater containing 400 mg l of cr vi by csm zn fe 2 2 1 was further investigated using three models e g pseudo first order pseudo second order and intra particle diffusion models to fit the data of cr vi removal a higher correlation coefficient of pseudo second order r2 0 9948 was obtained compared to that of the pseudo first order adsorption model r2 0 9669 this indicates that the process for treating cr vi containing wastewater followed with pseudo second order model which was mainly controlled by chemisorption 31 37 after treatment with csm zn fe 2 2 1 the intraparticle diffusion model was used to study the diffusion mechanism of cr vi removal from wastewater the data exhibited two linear plots demonstrating that two steps were required to remove cr vi from the wastewater fig 2 d cr diffused to the surface of the carbon materials at the beginning and then cr diffused towards the pores the second step did not pass through the origin indicating that both intra particle diffusion and chemical adsorption were the rate controlling factors for removing cr vi from wastewater 43 44 two langmuir s and freundlich s isotherm models were employed to fit the adsorption process as shown in fig 2 e and f compared to the freundlich model the langmuir model with a higher r2 values of 0 9506 better explained the adsorption data this implies that cr vi removal from wastewater was controlled by a single layer of chemisorption 45 after treating wastewater containing 300 mg l cr vi with csm zn fe 2 2 1 the adsorption kinetics and isotherms were also investigated and the results were similar to those obtained for 400 mg l cr vi solution fig 2 therefore the process for treating cr vi containing wastewater using csm zn fe 2 2 1 was mainly controlled via monolayer chemisorption supported by the pseudo second order kinetics and the langmuir model 3 4 roles of fecl3 and zncl2 in producing high performance carbon materials to further study the roles of fecl3 and zncl2 in the preparation of carbon materials with high performance bet analysis of carbon materials obtained after different amounts of fecl3 and zncl2 activation were performed fig 3 and table 2 in the range of the tested relative pressures fig 3 a csn fe and csm fe showed parallel adsorption and desorption branches indicating the existence of slit shaped pores 28 after treatment with zncl2 csn zn and csm zn exhibited type i isotherms with closed adsorption and desorption branches indicating the presence of micropores fig 3 b after simultaneous zn fe activation csn zn fe 1 1 1 and csm zn fe 2 2 1 exhibited isotherms similar to that activated with zncl2 alone fig 3 c this suggests that zncl2 plays a vital role in forming porous structures the csn zn fe 1 1 1 and csm zn fe 2 2 1 obtained by zn fe activation showed a significant increase in nitrogen uptake over the entire tested pressure range compared to the carbon materials prepared with a single activating agent fig 3 c this indicates zn fe activation enhances the adsorption capacity of the carbon materials the surface area of csn fe 48 8 m2 g and csm fe 59 8 m2 g were significantly lower than those of csn zn 486 5 m2 g and csm zn 1036 5 m2 g this might be ascribed to the fact that zinc salts as a dehydration reagent reacted with h and o in the carbon material thereby promoting pore formation 35 the surface area of the carbon materials increased dramatically after zn fe activation compared to that of carbon materials prepared with either zncl2 or fecl3 activation the prepared csm zn fe 2 2 1 achieved a higher surface area 1409 7 m2 g with a total pore volume of 0 714 cm3 g moreover an obvious increase in the proportion of micropore volume was observed after zncl2 activation and it was over 70 after zn fe activation according to the average pore size and pore size distribution plots table 2 and fig 3 d zn fe activated carbon contained both micropores and mesopores and micropores were predominant therefore zncl2 created a more microporous structure in the carbon and promoted a higher surface area of the carbon material with the help of fecl3 according to the sem images the corn stover had tight fibrous bundles without any porous channels and slits figs 4 a and s3 after fecl3 activation it was difficult to observe the formation of pores figs 4 b and s3 c the ordered tunnel shape pores constructed honeycomb like structure was observed after zncl2 activation while the shape of fibrous bundlers remained intact fig 4 c a similar phenomenon was observed after the zn fe activation fig 4 d suggesting that zncl2 exhibited better performance in controlling activation to produce hierarchical tunnel shaped pores the eds spectra confirmed that fe and zn particles were presented on the csm zn fe 2 2 1 fig 4 f xrd analysis showed that iron and zinc species were mainly in the form of fe3o4 and fe2zno4 after zn fe activation fig 4 h 31 33 46 47 as shown in fig 4 i an ft ir characteristic peak at 476 cm 1 assigned to the feo vibration of fe3o4 was observed for csm zn fe 2 2 1 31 suggesting that the prepared carbon material have a potential magnetic property as shown in the raman spectra of different carbon materials fig 4 j and table s1 there were two characteristic peaks at around 1357 and 1590 cm 1 representing the disordered or defective graphite structure d peak and ordered graphene structures g peak respectively 48 compared to the cs 350 precursor 1 057 a lower id ig ratios of csm fe 0 990 and csm zn 0 997 were obtained indicating that more graphite structures were developed after activation whereas the csm zn showed a slightly higher id ig value than csm fe suggesting that zncl2 was beneficial for the development of defective graphite structures 49 this finding was consistent with the bet results which showed that zncl2 activation produced carbon materials with a larger surface area the id ig ratio of csm zn fe 2 2 1 increased to 0 998 compared to those of csm zn 0 997 and csm fe 0 990 suggesting that zn fe activation enhanced the formation of defective graphite structures 3 5 possible mechanism for treating cr vi containing wastewater to study the mechanism of treating cr vi containing wastewater with carbon materials zeta potential of three different carbon materials csm zn fe 2 2 1 csmzn and csmfe was measured all three types of carbon materials exhibit positive zeta potentials the chromium has been reported in the form of cr2o7 and hcro4 at a ph of 2 34 this suggests that electrostatic attraction exists between the cr vi anions and positively charged carbon materials compared to the other two carbon materials csm fe had a lower zeta potential 4 65 mv with low efficiency in removing cr vi from wastewater the zeta potential of csm zn fe 2 2 1 was 12 5 mv remarkably close to that of csm zn 12 4 mv while csm zn fe 2 2 1 showed a higher removal of cr vi than csm zn indicating that electrostatic attraction was not the only factor for treating cr vi containing wastewater efficiently compared to csm zn and csm fe a larger surface area and rich pores of csm zn fe 2 2 1 were observed based on the bet and sem results table 2 and fig 4 which could increase the number of active adsorption sites compared to the diameter of cr 0 28 nm csm zn fe 2 2 1 had significantly larger pores with a size of 2 03 nm therefore pore adsorption could also be a factor that enhanced cr vi removal by zn fe activation additionally the ft ir characteristic peaks at 1569 1258 and 1365 cm 1 obviously increased for csm zn fe 2 2 1 after treating cr vi containing wastewater fig 4 i liu et al 2021 reported that the ft ir peaks at 800 1400 cm 1 could be assigned to the stretching vibration of ch or c o c 49 yin et al reported that the ft ir peak at 1569 cm 1 was attributable to the stretching vibration of cooh 50 this suggested that the carbon oxygen containing functional groups in carbon materials are involved in treating cr vi containing wastewater this was also proven by the c1s and o1s xps spectra fig s4 a and b where they both increased and shifted after the treatment after treating the cr vi solution the peak at 476 cm 1 assigned to feo groups in the ft ir spectra increased and shifted and the fe 2p xps spectra also significantly decreased figs 4 i and s4 c implying that the feo groups also took part in cr vi removal via chemical interactions the d and g peaks in the raman spectra of csm zn fe 2 2 1 decreased significantly after treatment with cr vi containing wastewater fig 4 j the id ig ratio of used csm zn fe 2 2 1 increased to 1 035 compared to that untreated cr vi containing wastewater 0 998 proving that the graphite structure was affected table s1 the pore walls of csm zn fe 2 2 1 in the sem images became rough possibly because of the adsorbed cr ions from the wastewater fig 4 e 51 in the xps spectra fig 5 a two peaks between 560 and 600 ev assigned to cr2p were observed 31 suggesting that cr was adsorbed by csm zn fe 2 2 1 the sem eds results confirmed that the cr was distributed on csm zn fe 2 2 1 after treating cr vi containing wastewater however 77 4 of cr vi was reduced to cr iii in solution after treating wastewater containing 100 mg l cr vi by cs zn fe 2 2 1 for 120 min this suggests that cr vi removal was mainly due to the formation of cr iii by the reduction reaction and this cr iii was further released into the solution as displayed in fig 5 the c1s xps spectra could be fitted with four peaks at binding energies of 284 6 286 1 287 4 and 289 3 ev corresponding to cc c oh co and cooh respectively 32 after treating cr vi containing wastewater with csm zn fe 2 2 1 the relative concentrations of cc and co decreased from 76 6 and 3 9 to 63 0 and 1 7 respectively the relative concentration of the peaks assigned to c oh and cooh increased from 11 2 and 8 4 to 24 3 and 11 0 respectively table s2 the deconvolution of the o 1s xps spectra gave three peaks at 530 3 531 2 and 532 9 ev representing the co c oh and cooh groups respectively 32 the co content decreased from 27 4 to 22 8 while those of c oh and cooh increased from 51 2 and 21 4 and 54 8 and 22 3 respectively following treatment with cr vi containing wastewater table s3 this suggests that the cc and co groups contained in the carbon materials were oxidized in the process of treating cr vi containing wastewater thus their relative contents decreased according to the ftir raman and xps results it was speculated that the cc and co groups in the carbon materials acted as electron donors and participated in the reduction of cr vi to cr iii while the c oh and cooh groups had chemical interactions with cr vi to further study the roles of fecl3 and zncl2 in activating carbon materials for treating cr vi containing wastewater the cr iii content in aqueous solutions following treatment with csm zn and csm fe at various times was analyzed as shown in fig 5 f and g it was found that the proportion of cr iii in the solution was relatively low in the first 10 min compared to cr vi removal after treatment with csm zn and csm fe cr iii proportion gradually increased with prolonging time from 10 to 120 min for example more than 85 of cr vi was removed in the first 10 min after treatment with csm zn and the cr vi removal increased to 99 7 with prolonging time to 120 mins while the proportion of cr iii in the aqueous solution increased significantly from 39 9 to 82 8 with prolonging time to 120 mins therefore cr vi was first adsorbed on the carbon materials owing to electrostatic attraction pore adsorption and chemical interactions under acidic conditions the cr iii formed by the reduction of cr vi can be described as follows 30 1 hcro 4 7h 3e cr 3 4h 2 o 2 cr 2 o 7 2 14 h 6e 2cr 3 7h 2 o the carbon oxygen containing functional groups in carbons acted as electron donors whereas free hydrogen was provided by the acidic solution 51 the adsorbed cr vi was then reduced to form cr iii which was in turn released into solution via electrostatic repulsion 51 xps icp oes and sem eds results showed that a small amount of zn species existed on the prepared csm zn fe 2 2 1 figs 4 f s4 d and table s4 while it almost decreased to zero after the treatment of cr vi solution fig 4 g this suggests that a minimal quantity of cr iii in the solution could re adsorbed on the carbon materials owing to ion exchange with zinc ions 51 additionally 82 8 cr vi was reduced to cr iii when treated with csm zn for 120 min compared to when treated with csm fe 20 4 and csm zn fe 2 2 1 77 4 zncl2 activation in comparison to fecl3 activation increased the relative contents of c c c o groups in the carbon materials based on xps analysis tables s2 and s3 this suggested that carbon materials originating from zncl2 activation were beneficial for the reduction of cr vi to cr iii in wastewater treatment therefore the possible mechanism for treating cr vi containing wastewater using zn fe activated carbon materials is proposed fig 5 c it was found that electrostatic interaction pore adsorption and chemical interactions played important roles in the adsorption of cr vi on carbon materials this is consistent with most studies on the removal of cr vi from wastewater table 3 in addition to these mechanisms cr vi removal by reducing to cr iii has also been reported however the roles of zncl2 and fecl3 in preparing carbon materials for cr vi removal from wastewater via reduction reaction are still unclear in this study the c c c o groups in csm zn fe 2 2 1 originating from zncl2 activation were found to promote the reduction of adsorbed cr vi to cr iii which was then released into the aqueous solution as a result of electrostatic repulsion the carbon materials originating from fecl3 activation slightly inhibited the reduction of cr vi and the presence of feo groups enhanced the adsorption of cr vi on the carbon materials via chemical interactions after treatment with csm zn fe 2 2 1 for 120 min more than 75 of the cr vi was reduced to cr iii indicating that the reduction reaction was the key mechanism for treating cr vi containing wastewater efficiently to the best of our knowledge such findings have been seldom reported in the existing literature on cr vi containing wastewater treatment 34 42 these findings were driven by various mechanisms for treating cr vi containing wastewater efficiently using carbon materials guiding the production of high performance carbon materials from waste biomass by modulating zn fe activation 4 conclusions a high performance carbon material with a high sbet 1409 7 m2 g prepared by zn fe activation of corn stover was successfully used for treating cr vi containing wastewater with the maximum cr vi removal of 185 8 mg g zncl2 activation produced carbon materials with abundant active adsorption sites while fecl3 activation enhanced the magnetic properties of carbon materials the pseudo second order kinetics and langmuir models fit the process for treating cr vi containing wastewater well it was discovered that the cr vi was adsorbed on carbon materials via pore adsorption electrostatic interaction and chemical interactions and then the adsorbed cr vi reduced into cr iii and released in solution which significantly improved the efficiency of cr vi removal from

13064,the ball milled zero valent iron zvi biochar composite bm zvi bc with excellent dispersion and oxidation resistance was prepared by the ball milling method and to explore its removal capacity to cr vi under weak magnetic field wmf characterization analysis confirmed that the surface of bm zvi bc was successfully loaded with zvi a series of experimental factors mass ratio of zvi and bc ball milling time dosage and initial ph were examined to investigate the effect on removal performance in different reaction systems as the increase of the mass ratio of zvi to bc and the extension of milling time the removal of cr vi firstly increased and then decreased with the best results at 4 1 and 1 5 h respectively moreover the cr vi removal capacity decreased as the ph increased ph 2 8 the removal capacity of cr vi by bm zvi bc reached 364 26 mg g 1 which was significantly more than that of the ball milled biochar bm bc 3 92 mg g 1 and ball milled zero valent iron bm zvi 7 83 mg g 1 biochar as a carrier for zvi could effectively disperse zvi in solution mitigating the agglomeration effect when zvi was present alone with wmf the removal capacity of cr vi by bm zvi bc wmf was increased by 5 67 126 03 compared to bm zvi bc at ph 2 8 wmf promoted the release of iron ions and mitigated the effect of the passivation layer the apparent rate constant k obs increased from 0 185 min 1 to 0 221 min 1 after the application of wmf indicating that wmf accelerated the removal of cr vi overall the combination of biochar wmf and zvi has potential in the removal of cr vi graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords cr vi weak magnetic field zero valent iron biochar ball milling 1 introduction hexavalent chromium cr vi comes from metallurgy textile manufacturing electroplating leather manufacturing and other industries currently cr vi is causing widespread concern about its harmful effects on humans and the environment 1 3 the high solubility fluidity and carcinogenicity of cr vi make it more hazardous and dangerous than cr iii 4 6 when cr vi is enriched in the human body it can cause serious damage to the liver lungs kidneys and other organs 7 8 therefore using an efficient material or method to reduce cr vi is a hot research topic to mitigate the harm of cr vi adsorption reduction and membrane separation techniques have been used to remove it 9 among them reduction is widely used due to its rapid reaction and low secondary pollution to date many researchers have studied the reduction of cr vi with zero valent iron zvi 10 12 the good reactivity and environmental friendliness of zvi make it widely used in the treatment of cr vi in wastewater zvi has excellent potential to remove heavy metals and organic pollutants but the reaction activity decreases rapidly due to agglomeration and passivation during the reaction process 13 14 which is an urgent problem to solve various research methods have been reported to overcome these deficiencies including physical chemical and biological methods for example acid washing 15 carrier modification 16 vulcanization 17 bimetallic system 18 combined oxidant 19 surface coating 20 weak magnetic field 21 combined with bacteria 22 etc in recent years many studies on the modification of zvi with carriers have been reported compared to other carriers biochar is an inexpensive and readily available carbonaceous material such as graphene oxide 23 activated carbon 24 and zeolites 25 the excellent specific surface area and pore volume of biochar is favorable for zvi loading thus effectively supporting and dispersing zvi 26 in addition the surface of biochar has abundant functional groups where the oxygen containing functional groups and functional groups associated with the conjugated aromatic structure increase electrical conductivity of biochar enhance electron transfer in redox reactions 27 in addition the use of the ball milling method to compound biochar and commercial zero valent iron is very green and efficient because it is low cost simple to prepare does not produce chemical waste leading to secondary pollution and can effectively reduce the particle size of biochar and commercial zero valent iron which leads to an increase in reactivity due to the low production cost and simple preparation process of commercial zero valent iron and biochar it is beneficial to be widely used in real life weak magnetic field wmf is also an effective method to improve defects of zvi wmf mitigates the effect of the passivation layer of zvi 28 resulting in a significant acceleration of cr vi removal rate and an enhancement of the cr vi removal capacity this process does not require additional energy or extra chemicals which has the advantage of being environmentally friendly energy efficient and economical 29 at present there are few studies on the simultaneous use of wmf and biochar to enhance the cr vi removal capacity by zvi therefore this study proposed to combine wmf zvi and biochar to remove cr vi wmf can improve the cr vi removal ability oxidation resistance and reaction rate of the composite in addition biochar acts as a carrier not only to disperse zvi to avoid zvi agglomeration but also as an electron conductor to enhance electron transfer and these advantages can be maximized in the presence of wmf the combination of the three ultimately further improves the removal capacity of cr vi and this method is green stable and low cost in this study rice straw biochar bc and wmf were used to improve cr vi removal by zvi the study included 1 preparation and characterization of zero valent iron biochar composite bm zvi bc 2 examination of the effects of different composite preparation conditions such as zvi to bc mass ratio and ball milling time on cr vi removal by bm zvi bc and bm zvi bc wmf 3 investigation of the effects of initial ph dosage and aging on cr vi removal by bm zvi bc and bm zvi bc wmf 2 materials and methods 2 1

deionized water before being dried in a 95 c oven for 10 h grind the straw stalk to a particle size of about 1 mm then grind until it can pass through a 100 mesh sieve take an appropriate amount of straw stalk powder place it in a vacuum tube furnace otf 1200x hefei kejing material technology co ltd anhui china after heating at 10 c min to 500 c stand for 2 h preparation of composites firstly 10 g of the mixture of zvi and bc were put into the ball mill jar in different mass ratios zvi bc 6 1 4 1 2 1 1 1 1 2 1 4 and 1 6 then 500 g stainless steel balls were added the mass ratio of 15 mm 5 mm and 3 mm small balls was 2 5 3 respectively and the ball mill jar was sealed and fixed in a planetary ball mill changsha tianchuang powder changsha china after 30 min of pumping by a vacuum pump the ball milling time was 1 5 h and the speed was 400 rpm the composites obtained by ball milling were named bm zvi bc 6 1 bm zvi bc 4 1 bm zvi bc 2 1 bm zvi bc 1 1 bm zvi bc 1 2 bm zvi bc 1 4 and bm zvi bc 1 6 ball milled biochar bm bc and ball milled zero valent iron bm zvi were prepared under the same conditions after comparing the removal effect of bm bc bm zvi and bm zvi bc with different mass ratios it was found that bm zvi bc 4 1 had the best removal effect therefore to explore the influence of ball milling time bm zvi bc 4 1 was prepared by ball milling for 0 5 1 1 5 and 2 h 2 3 characterizations x ray crystal diffraction xrd rigaku d max2500 was applied to determine the crystal composition of composites before and after the reaction the organic functional groups on the sample surface in the wavelength range of 400 4000 cm 1 were determined by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir is50 thermo fisher usa by scanning electron microscope sem supra555 zeiss germany and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds we analyzed both the morphology of the sample and its distribution of elements the bet surface area pore size distribution and pore volume were obtained by a physical adsorption apparatus asap2460 usa at 77 3 k the bm zvi bc was examined before and after the reaction using x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps escalab 250xi thermo fisher usa and al kα radiation zeta potential was analyzed with zeta sizer nano instrument nano zs china in the range of ph 2 8 a teslameter ht201 shanghai hengtong magnetics technology co ltd shanghai china measured the magnetic field intensity 2 4 removal experiments each experiment was performed in conical bottles 250 ml at 25 c in the presence of wmf the reaction solution was blended via a mechanical stirrer with a speed of 200 rpm to avoid agglomeration of bm zvi bc the magnetic field strength was 20 mt by adjusting the vertical distance between the bottom of the conical flask and the neodymium magnet hcl and naoh were used to adjust the initial solution ph to 2 it was determined experimentally that the material had the best removal performance at ph 2 except for experiments investigating the effect of initial ph the ph meter phs 3c shanghai lei magnetic measured the ph value of the solution and was calibrated before each use the effects of zvi to bc mass ratios zvi bc 6 1 4 1 2 1 1 1 1 2 1 4 and 1 6 and ball milling times 0 5 1 1 5 and 2 h were investigated to determine better bm zvi bc preparation conditions in addition the effects of initial solution ph 2 3 4 5 6 7 and 8 dosage 0 2 3 0 g l 1 and aging time 0 30 d on cr vi removal were investigated repeat each experiment at least twice at the end of the reaction the solution was filtered using a 0 22um membrane the cr vi concentration of filtrate was measured by an ultraviolet spectrophotometer uv3600 japanese shimadzu corporation using the diphenylcarbazide method at 540 nm flame atomic absorption spectrometry aa300 shanghai china was applied to measure the total iron and total chromium concentrations of the filtrate the calculation method of removal efficiency and removal capacity is shown in the support information si section 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterizations the sem images of bc bm bc bm zvi and bm zvi bc 4 1 are shown in fig 1 compared with the original bc fig 1 a the particle size decreased remarkably after ball milling fig 1 b it provided an excellent attachment site for zvi particles as shown in fig 1 c the particle size of bm zvi after ball milling was approximately 1 um in addition on the surface of bm zvi bc 4 1 there were many gray particles of about 1 um attached fig 1 d this indicated that the bm zvi bc was loaded with zvi and the sem eds results of bm zvi bc 4 1 fig s1 showed that fe particles were uniformly attached to the surface of bc which further proved that the bm zvi bc 4 1 was prepared successfully in addition the loading of the zvi on the bc was analyzed by a magnetic experiment the experimental method of which is shown in the supporting information si section 2 and the results are shown in fig s2 the results showed that bm bc a was not attracted while bm zvi b and bm zvi bc c were completely attracted and only a part of the mixture of zvi and bc d was attracted which indicated that the zvi in bm zvi bc had bonded to the bc which was attributed to the mechanical forces generated by the collision of the ball milling beads during the ball milling process it was finally confirmed that the zvi particles were loaded onto the bc particles the bet information of bc bm zvi bc 4 1 and bm bc was presented in table s1 after ball milling the surface area and pore volume of bc increased significantly which was attributed to the reduction of material size by the collision of grinding balls 30 the bet surface area and pore volume of bm bc loaded with zvi decreased but the pore size increased by 1 19 times on the one hand zvi occupied part of the micropores of bc on the other hand the attachment of zvi changed the morphology of bc forming a fluffy material with a larger pore size 31 the xrd of bm bc bm zvi bc 1 4 and bm zvi are shown in fig 2 a 2θ 26 5 44 7 and 65 respectively showed a peak of biochar and diffraction peaks of 110 and 200 crystal planes of fe0 pdf no 06 0696 as bm zvi bc 1 4 bc and fe0 diffraction peaks were detected suggesting that biochar and zvi were successfully combined the xrd of bm zvi bc with different mass ratios is shown in fig 2 b with the increase of the mass ratio of zvi the diffraction peak intensity of fe0 gradually increased while the diffraction peak of bc decreased the diffraction peak of bc disappeared when the mass ratio of zvi to bc was more than 2 1 which may be masked by zvi the ftir of bc bm bc and bm zvi bc 4 1 are shown in fig 2 c the peaks at 3441 cm 1 3129 cm 1 1620 cm 1 1400 cm 1 and 1105 cm 1 were indicated as the tensile vibration for oh nh group 9 co and cc 32 cc and co 33 respectively moreover a novel peak due to feo tensile vibration appeared at 480 cm 1 on bm zvi bc which further indicated that zvi was successfully combined with bc 3 2 the effects of the mass ratio of zvi and bc of bm zvi bc on the removal of cr vi the removal capacity and removal efficiency of cr vi by bm bc bm zvi and bm zvi bc 4 1 are shown in fig 3 a without wmf cr vi removal capacity and removal efficiency were poor with bm bc or bm zvi alone with a removal capacity of 3 92 mg g 1 and 7 83 mg g 1 and removal efficiency of 0 66 and 1 31 respectively when zvi was loaded on bc cr vi removal capacity by bm zvi bc was significantly improved which was consistent with the previous reports that zero valent iron loaded biochar facilitated a substantial improvement in the removal of heavy metals 34 the effects of zvi and bc mass ratio on cr vi removal capacity and efficiency by bm zvi bc and bm zvi bc wmf are shown in fig 3 b interestingly as the mass ratio improved from 1 6 to 6 1 it showed a trend that the removal efficiency and removal capacity increased and then decreased the removal efficiency and capacity peaked at a mass ratio of 4 1 with 60 23 and 364 26 mg g 1 respectively due to the improvement of the contact area between zvi and cr vi more electrons were provided by fe0 during the reaction however as the mass ratio of zvi to bc rose to 6 1 the removal efficiency and removal capacity decreased to 52 20 and 315 69 mg g 1 this result was due to the aggregation of zvi as the mass ratio improved from 1 6 to 6 1 the content of zvi was 0 048 g l 1 0 066 g l 1 0 111 g l 1 0 167 g l 1 0 222 g l 1 0 266 g l 1 0 285 g l 1 the benefit of wmf were 43 57 34 71 16 37 10 67 5 31 3 01 and 2 23 respectively this showed that as the content of zvi increased the benefit of wmf decreased with wmf cr vi removal efficiency and capacity by bm zvi bc and bm zvi were improved particularly noticeable was the 40 74 and 43 57 increase in removal capacity for bm zvi and bm zvi bc 1 6 at ph 2 respectively furthermore the cr vi removal trend by bm zvi bc wmf under different zvi to bc mass ratios was the same as that without wmf moreover the cr vi removal capacities of bm bc bm bc wmf bm zvi bm zvi wmf bm zvi bc and bm zvi bc wmf were compared cr vi removal by zvi was enhanced by wmf and was further enhanced by loading bc this result indicates that bc and wmf could effectively increase cr vi removal by zvi through synergistic effects the subsequent experiment used a mass ratio of 4 1 3 3 the effects of ball milling time of bm zvi bc on the removal of cr vi without wmf removal efficiency and capacity of cr vi increased gradually from 37 12 and 223 49 mg g 1 to 59 92 and 362 41 mg g 1 when the ball milling time was extended from 0 5 h to 1 5 h fig 3 c however with the further increase of the milling time the removal effect of cr vi by bm zvi bc wmf decreased there are two reasons for the reduction of removal effect 1 the size of bm zvi bc was too small to result in agglomeration 2 the bc particle size is too small to effectively support zvi resulting in a large number of zvi particles broke away from bc and formed passivation layer with wmf the removal efficiency and capacity of bm zvi bc to cr vi were improved at a ball milling time of 1 5 h the removal capacity and removal increased to 62 39 and 377 29 mg g 1 ball milling time of 1 5 h was used for subsequent experiments 3 4 the effects of initial ph on the removal of cr vi with and without wmf the removal efficiency and capacity of bm zvi bc for cr vi decreased with the increase of ph ph 2 8 fig 4 a indicating that removal of cr vi was more accessible with a lower ph solution this result is caused by the following reasons 1 fig 4 b shows that ph increased after reduction of cr vi at various initial ph suggesting that h was expended during reduction of cr vi thus a higher concentration of h made the transformation of cr vi to cr iii easier 35 2 according to previous studies cr vi mainly existed in the form of hcro4 ph 1 6 cr2o7 2 ph 6 0 7 5 and cro4 2 ph 6 0 17 compared with forms of cr2o7 2 and cro4 2 hcro4 was advantageous to electrostatic adsorption due to its lower adsorption free energy 3 when the ph was lower than point of zero charge fig 4 c the bm zvi bc surface was positively charged thereby enhancing the electrostatic adsorption between cr vi anions and the surface of the material 5 4 the total iron ion content of reaction solution was extremely low when ph 7 fig 4 b because there was not enough h to dissolve fe0 and the oxides 36 leading to surface passivation of bm zvi bc in addition with wmf more fe ions were produced after the reaction indicating that wmf promoted the corrosion of fe0 21 thus acidic conditions proved to be favorable for cr vi removal the increase in cr vi removal capacity by wmf was only 5 67 at initial ph 2 at ph 3 8 the increase was relatively significant especially the removal capacity of bm zvi bc wmf to cr vi increased by about 126 03 at ph 5 from 18 02 mg g 1 to 40 73 mg g 1 the results showed a more remarkable wmf promotion effect at higher ph the promotion of wmf tended to increase and then decrease with rising ph which might be due to the development of a passivation layer at higher ph 28 3 5 the effects of dosage of bm zvi bc on the removal of cr vi when the bm zvi bc dosage was added from 0 2 g l 1 to 1 g l 1 removal efficiency was improved from 31 35 to 100 fig 4 d this may be due to the increased contact area of bm zvi bc with cr vi in solution resulting in more reactive sites on the composite being involved in the reaction then cr vi removal efficiency remained constant with increasing dosage however the removal capacity of bm zvi bc wmf to cr vi showed an increasing and then decreasing trend with dosage addition reaching 378 05 mg g 1 at the dosage of 0 333 g l 1 at this dosage the utilization of the composite material was maximized for practical applications a dose of 1 g l 1 should be chosen to achieve 100 removal however subsequent experiments in this study needed to calculate the extent to which wmf enhanced cr vi removal so instead of using 1 g l 1 0 333 g l 1 was chosen 3 6 reaction kinetics the data of removal of cr vi in bm zvi bc and bm zvi bc wmf systems were fitted with the pseudo first order kinetics model fig s3 r 2 0 9 20 37 38 1 ln c 0 c t k obs t where c 0 is the initial concentration of the substance c t the concentration of the substance at time t min and the apparent rate constant k obs min 1 the k obs increased from 0 185 min 1 to 0 221 min 1 further indicating that the wmf accelerated the reduction of cr vi 3 7 effects of aging time the material is exposed to air for a period to produce an oxide film which is a frequent aging phenomenon of zvi materials in this study bm zvi bc was exposed to air for 30 d and compared with fresh bm zvi bc to investigate the effect of aging time on the removal capacity of the material to cr vi as shown in fig 5 the removal capacity of bm zvi bc to cr vi decreased from 358 66 mg g 1 to 221 32 mg g 1 after 30 days of aging the removal capacity of bm zvi bc wmf to cr vi decreased from 373 45 mg g 1 to 286 55 mg g 1 retaining a higher removal capacity than the bm zvi bc system the result showed that the reaction activity of aged bm zvi bc was significantly reduced which could be attributed to the oxide film on the surface of bm zvi bc masking the redox active sites 20 however this effect was significantly reduced by the wmf 3 8 mechanism analysis 3 8 1 chromium species determination xrd after reaction and xps analysis the removal mechanism of cr vi was further investigated by measuring the concentrations of various classes of chromium in different reaction systems during the reaction with bm bc bm zvi bm zvi bc and bm zvi bc wmf the concentrations of different kinds of cr are shown in fig 6 the results showed that almost no cr iii was produced in the bm bc system and the total chromium and cr vi concentrations decreased to 17 66 mg l 1 fig 6 a therefore bm bc removed cr vi by adsorption in the bm zvi system fig 6 b 1 97 mg l 1 cr iii was produced but the total chromium content did not change significantly therefore bm zvi mainly removed cr vi by reduction the final cr iii concentration in bm zvi bc and bm zvi bc wmf system reached 16 20 mg l 1 fig 6 c and 14 50 mg l 1 fig 6 d indicating that cr vi was reduced in addition the significant decrease in cr vi concentration during the first 1 h could be attributed to the simultaneous occurrence of adsorption and reduction reactions as shown in fig s4 bm zvi bc showed new characteristic peaks on the xrd after the reaction firstly the characteristic peaks of the masked biochar reappeared due to the depletion of zvi from the material surface in addition characteristic peaks for fecr2o4 cr2o3 fe2o3 fe3o4 were detected indicating that cr vi was reduced to cr iii and formed precipitation of fecr oxides with fe iii 26 39 40 fig 7 shows the xps spectrum of bm zvi bc and bm zvi bc wmf before and after the reaction the main elements before the reaction are c o and fe and the main elements after the reaction are c o fe and cr as shown in fig 7 a peaks of c 1s o 1s and fe 2p were present before reaction and cr 2p peaks appeared after reaction confirming the involvement of the chemisorption process in cr vi removal 24 for fe 2p fig 7 b the fe 2p spectrum in bm zvi bc before reaction has five peaks near 706 8 ev 710 95 ev 713 24 ev 719 73 ev and 724 6 ev corresponding to fe0 fe2o3 fe ii satellite fe iii satellite and feooh 36 respectively in the absence of wmf the peak of fe0 disappeared after reaction the relative content of the fe ii satellite decreased from 23 9 to 15 5 and fe2o3 fe iii and feooh increased these results indicated that fe0 fe ii was oxidized to fe ii fe iii during the reaction 41 with wmf fe ii satellite fe iii satellite and feooh decreased from 15 5 6 5 and 32 5 to 11 8 2 9 and 30 4 respectively and fe2o3 increased from 45 5 and to 54 9 as shown in fig 7 c with the presence or absence of wmf the peaks near 577 22 ev and 587 55 ev were attributed to cr iii and the peak near 579 79 ev and 588 85 ev belonged to cr vi 42 the results showed that chromium was mainly present as cr iii after the reaction with a little cr vi with wmf the percentage of cr iii increased from 78 2 to 87 6 in summary the presence of wmf did not alter the reaction mechanism but increased the reduction efficiency of cr vi 3 8 2 removal mechanism the removal mechanisms of bm zvi bc wmf to cr vi are shown in fig 8 the process of removal involved adsorption reduction and co precipitation with reduction playing a key role 1 cr vi was adsorbed on the surface of bm zvi bc due to high porosity and specific surface area and then removed 35 2 cr vi was reduced to cr iii by electrons supplied from fe0 and fe2 eqs 2 3 and 4 43 with wmf the magnetization of zvi induced mf on its surface and produced a magnetic gradient force f b 29 44 by the force of f b the paramagnetic fe2 moved along the magnetic lines of force towards the higher magnetic flux strength of the mf such that a concentration gradient of fe2 was formed in addition this fe2 concentration gradient produced an additional driving force acting on the reaction mixture in solution this force will lead to a redistribution of velocities in the diffusion layer this ultimately will accelerate the dissolution of iron facilitating the reaction and slowing down the deposition of ferrous hydroxide on the bm zvi bc surface 45 3 finally cr iii was present in the form of cr1 xfex oh 3 eq 5 41 2 2 hcr o 4 14 h 3 f e 0 2 c r 3 3 f e 2 8 h 2 o 3 hcr o 4 7 h 3 f e 2 c r 3 4 h 2 o 3 f e 3 4 c r 2 o 7 2 14 h 2 f e 0

practical applications water from ge lake changzhou china was collected to prepare cr vi solution and then treated with bm zvi bc wmf table 1 shows the parameters of the cr vi solution of the actual environmental matrix before and after treatment where the removal efficiency of cr vi reached 99 0 and the remaining concentration has been lower than the chinese emission standard 0 5 mg l 1 reaction conditions dosage 0 333 g l 1 reaction time 1 h and temperature 25 c 4 conclusion in this study a combination of wmf zvi and biochar was used to remove cr vi with excellent results the removal of cr vi by bm zvi bc synthesized via the ball milling method was much more effective than zvi or bc alone bc effectively disperses zvi as a carrier and improves reactivity of zvi acidic conditions favored the removal of cr vi by bm zvi bc wmf increased the removal capacity of bm zvi bc to cr vi enhanced aging resistance and accelerated reaction rate moreover the effect of wmf on cr vi removal capacity enhancement was related to the content in zvi which showed an increasing and then decreasing trend with the growth of zvi content reduction was the main mechanism to remove cr vi the positive effect of wmf is attributed to the production of f b in conclusion the combination of wmf biochar and zvi has potential in the removal of cr vi credit authorship contribution statement sihai zhou

13064,the ball milled zero valent iron zvi biochar composite bm zvi bc with excellent dispersion and oxidation resistance was prepared by the ball milling method and to explore its removal capacity to cr vi under weak magnetic field wmf characterization analysis confirmed that the surface of bm zvi bc was successfully loaded with zvi a series of experimental factors mass ratio of zvi and bc ball milling time dosage and initial ph were examined to investigate the effect on removal performance in different reaction systems as the increase of the mass ratio of zvi to bc and the extension of milling time the removal of cr vi firstly increased and then decreased with the best results at 4 1 and 1 5 h respectively moreover the cr vi removal capacity decreased as the ph increased ph 2 8 the removal capacity of cr vi by bm zvi bc reached 364 26 mg g 1 which was significantly more than that of the ball milled biochar bm bc 3 92 mg g 1 and ball milled zero valent iron bm zvi 7 83 mg g 1 biochar as a carrier for zvi could effectively disperse zvi in solution mitigating the agglomeration effect when zvi was present alone with wmf the removal capacity of cr vi by bm zvi bc wmf was increased by 5 67 126 03 compared to bm zvi bc at ph 2 8 wmf promoted the release of iron ions and mitigated the effect of the passivation layer the apparent rate constant k obs increased from 0 185 min 1 to 0 221 min 1 after the application of wmf indicating that wmf accelerated the removal of cr vi overall the combination of biochar wmf and zvi has potential in the removal of cr vi graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords cr vi weak magnetic field zero valent iron biochar ball milling 1 introduction hexavalent chromium cr vi comes from metallurgy textile manufacturing electroplating leather manufacturing and other industries currently cr vi is causing widespread concern about its harmful effects on humans and the environment 1 3 the high solubility fluidity and carcinogenicity of cr vi make it more hazardous and dangerous than cr iii 4 6 when cr vi is enriched in the human body it can cause serious damage to the liver lungs kidneys and other organs 7 8 therefore using an efficient material or method to reduce cr vi is a hot research topic to mitigate the harm of cr vi adsorption reduction and membrane separation techniques have been used to remove it 9 among them reduction is widely used due to its rapid reaction and low secondary pollution to date many researchers have studied the reduction of cr vi with zero valent iron zvi 10 12 the good reactivity and environmental friendliness of zvi make it widely used in the treatment of cr vi in wastewater zvi has excellent potential to remove heavy metals and organic pollutants but the reaction activity decreases rapidly due to agglomeration and passivation during the reaction process 13 14 which is an urgent problem to solve various research methods have been reported to overcome these deficiencies including physical chemical and biological methods for example acid washing 15 carrier modification 16 vulcanization 17 bimetallic system 18 combined oxidant 19 surface coating 20 weak magnetic field 21 combined with bacteria 22 etc in recent years many studies on the modification of zvi with carriers have been reported compared to other carriers biochar is an inexpensive and readily available carbonaceous material such as graphene oxide 23 activated carbon 24 and zeolites 25 the excellent specific surface area and pore volume of biochar is favorable for zvi loading thus effectively supporting and dispersing zvi 26 in addition the surface of biochar has abundant functional groups where the oxygen containing functional groups and functional groups associated with the conjugated aromatic structure increase electrical conductivity of biochar enhance electron transfer in redox reactions 27 in addition the use of the ball milling method to compound biochar and commercial zero valent iron is very green and efficient because it is low cost simple to prepare does not produce chemical waste leading to secondary pollution and can effectively reduce the particle size of biochar and commercial zero valent iron which leads to an increase in reactivity due to the low production cost and simple preparation process of commercial zero valent iron and biochar it is beneficial to be widely used in real life weak magnetic field wmf is also an effective method to improve defects of zvi wmf mitigates the effect of the passivation layer of zvi 28 resulting in a significant acceleration of cr vi removal rate and an enhancement of the cr vi removal capacity this process does not require additional energy or extra chemicals which has the advantage of being environmentally friendly energy efficient and economical 29 at present there are few studies on the simultaneous use of wmf and biochar to enhance the cr vi removal capacity by zvi therefore this study proposed to combine wmf zvi and biochar to remove cr vi wmf can improve the cr vi removal ability oxidation resistance and reaction rate of the composite in addition biochar acts as a carrier not only to disperse zvi to avoid zvi agglomeration but also as an electron conductor to enhance electron transfer and these advantages can be maximized in the presence of wmf the combination of the three ultimately further improves the removal capacity of cr vi and this method is green stable and low cost in this study rice straw biochar bc and wmf were used to improve cr vi removal by zvi the study included 1 preparation and characterization of zero valent iron biochar composite bm zvi bc 2 examination of the effects of different composite preparation conditions such as zvi to bc mass ratio and ball milling time on cr vi removal by bm zvi bc and bm zvi bc wmf 3 investigation of the effects of initial ph dosage and aging on cr vi removal by bm zvi bc and bm zvi bc wmf 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals hydrochloric acid hcl potassium dichromate k2cr2o7 sulfuric acid h2so4 phosphoric acid h3po4 acetone c3h6o sodium hydroxide naoh and diphenylcarbonyl dihydrazide c13h14n4o were purchased

mesh was purchased from shijawei technology co ltd chengdu china wmf was produced by circular neodymium magnets d 4 cm 2 2 preparation of composites preparation of bc the rice straw was cleaned in deionized water before being dried in a 95 c oven for 10 h grind the straw stalk to a particle size of about 1 mm then grind until it can pass through a 100 mesh sieve take an appropriate amount of straw stalk powder place it in a vacuum tube furnace otf 1200x hefei kejing material technology co ltd anhui china after heating at 10 c min to 500 c stand for 2 h preparation of composites firstly 10 g of the mixture of zvi and bc were put into the ball mill jar in different mass ratios zvi bc 6 1 4 1 2 1 1 1 1 2 1 4 and 1 6 then 500 g stainless steel balls were added the mass ratio of 15 mm 5 mm and 3 mm small balls was 2 5 3 respectively and the ball mill jar was sealed and fixed in a planetary ball mill changsha tianchuang powder changsha china after 30 min of pumping by a vacuum pump the ball milling time was 1 5 h and the speed was 400 rpm the composites obtained by ball milling were named bm zvi bc 6 1 bm zvi bc 4 1 bm zvi bc 2 1 bm zvi bc 1 1 bm zvi bc 1 2 bm zvi bc 1 4 and bm zvi bc 1 6 ball milled biochar bm bc and ball milled zero valent iron bm zvi were prepared under the same conditions after comparing the removal effect of bm bc bm zvi and bm zvi bc with different mass ratios it was found that bm zvi bc 4 1 had the best removal effect therefore to explore the influence of ball milling time bm zvi bc 4 1 was prepared by ball milling for 0 5 1 1 5 and 2 h 2 3 characterizations x ray crystal diffraction xrd rigaku d max2500 was applied to determine the crystal composition of composites before and after the reaction the organic functional groups on the sample surface in the wavelength range of 400 4000 cm 1 were determined by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir is50 thermo fisher usa by scanning electron microscope sem supra555 zeiss germany and energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds we analyzed both the morphology of the sample and its distribution of elements the bet surface area pore size distribution and pore volume were obtained by a physical adsorption apparatus asap2460 usa at 77 3 k the bm zvi bc was examined before and after the reaction using x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps escalab 250xi thermo fisher usa and al kα radiation zeta potential was analyzed with zeta sizer nano instrument nano zs china in the range of ph 2 8 a teslameter ht201 shanghai hengtong magnetics technology co ltd shanghai china measured the magnetic field intensity 2 4 removal experiments each experiment was performed in conical bottles 250 ml at 25 c in the presence of wmf the reaction solution was blended via a mechanical stirrer with a speed of 200 rpm to avoid agglomeration of bm zvi bc the magnetic field strength was 20 mt by adjusting the vertical distance between the bottom of the conical flask and the neodymium magnet hcl and naoh were used to adjust the initial solution ph to 2 it was determined experimentally that the material had the best removal performance at ph 2 except for experiments investigating the effect of initial ph the ph meter phs 3c shanghai lei magnetic measured the ph value of the solution and was calibrated before each use the effects of zvi to bc mass ratios zvi bc 6 1 4 1 2 1 1 1 1 2 1 4 and 1 6 and ball milling times 0 5 1 1 5 and 2 h were investigated to determine better bm zvi bc preparation conditions in addition the effects of initial solution ph 2 3 4 5 6 7 and 8 dosage 0 2 3 0 g l 1 and aging time 0 30 d on cr vi removal were investigated repeat each experiment at least twice at the end of the reaction the solution was filtered using a 0 22um membrane the cr vi concentration of filtrate was measured by an ultraviolet spectrophotometer uv3600 japanese shimadzu corporation using the diphenylcarbazide method at 540 nm flame atomic absorption spectrometry aa300 shanghai china was applied to measure the total iron and total chromium concentrations of the filtrate the calculation method of removal efficiency and removal capacity is shown in the support information si section 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterizations the sem images of bc bm bc bm zvi and bm zvi bc 4 1 are shown in fig 1 compared with the original bc fig 1 a the particle size decreased remarkably after ball milling fig 1 b it provided an excellent attachment site for zvi particles as shown in fig 1 c the particle size of bm zvi after ball milling was approximately 1 um in addition on the surface of bm zvi bc 4 1 there were many gray particles of about 1 um attached fig 1 d this indicated that the bm zvi bc was loaded with zvi and the sem eds results of bm zvi bc 4 1 fig s1 showed that fe particles were uniformly attached to the surface of bc which further proved that the bm zvi bc 4 1 was prepared successfully in addition the loading of the zvi on the bc was analyzed by a magnetic experiment the experimental method of which is shown in the supporting information si section 2 and the results are shown in fig s2 the results showed that bm bc a was not attracted while bm zvi b and bm zvi bc c were completely attracted and only a part of the mixture of zvi and bc d was attracted which indicated that the zvi in bm zvi bc had bonded to the bc which was attributed to the mechanical forces generated by the collision of the ball milling beads during the ball milling process it was finally confirmed that the zvi particles were loaded onto the bc particles the bet information of bc bm zvi bc 4 1 and bm bc was presented in table s1 after ball milling the surface area and pore volume of bc increased significantly which was attributed to the reduction of material size by the collision of grinding balls 30 the bet surface area and pore volume of bm bc loaded with zvi decreased but the pore size increased by 1 19 times on the one hand zvi occupied part of the micropores of bc on the other hand the attachment of zvi changed the morphology of bc forming a fluffy material with a larger pore size 31 the xrd of bm bc bm zvi bc 1 4 and bm zvi are shown in fig 2 a 2θ 26 5 44 7 and 65 respectively showed a peak of biochar and diffraction peaks of 110 and 200 crystal planes of fe0 pdf no 06 0696 as bm zvi bc 1 4 bc and fe0 diffraction peaks were detected suggesting that biochar and zvi were successfully combined the xrd of bm zvi bc with different mass ratios is shown in fig 2 b with the increase of the mass ratio of zvi the diffraction peak intensity of fe0 gradually increased while the diffraction peak of bc decreased the diffraction peak of bc disappeared when the mass ratio of zvi to bc was more than 2 1 which may be masked by zvi the ftir of bc bm bc and bm zvi bc 4 1 are shown in fig 2 c the peaks at 3441 cm 1 3129 cm 1 1620 cm 1 1400 cm 1 and 1105 cm 1 were indicated as the tensile vibration for oh nh group 9 co and cc 32 cc and co 33 respectively moreover a novel peak due to feo tensile vibration appeared at 480 cm 1 on bm zvi bc which further indicated that zvi was successfully combined with bc 3 2 the effects of the mass ratio of zvi and bc of bm zvi bc on the removal of cr vi the removal capacity and removal efficiency of cr vi by bm bc bm zvi and bm zvi bc 4 1 are shown in fig 3 a without wmf cr vi removal capacity and removal efficiency were poor with bm bc or bm zvi alone with a removal capacity of 3 92 mg g 1 and 7 83 mg g 1 and removal efficiency of 0 66 and 1 31 respectively when zvi was loaded on bc cr vi removal capacity by bm zvi bc was significantly improved which was consistent with the previous reports that zero valent iron loaded biochar facilitated a substantial improvement in the removal of heavy metals 34 the effects of zvi and bc mass ratio on cr vi removal capacity and efficiency by bm zvi bc and bm zvi bc wmf are shown in fig 3 b interestingly as the mass ratio improved from 1 6 to 6 1 it showed a trend that the removal efficiency and removal capacity increased and then decreased the removal efficiency and capacity peaked at a mass ratio of 4 1 with 60 23 and 364 26 mg g 1 respectively due to the improvement of the contact area between zvi and cr vi more electrons were provided by fe0 during the reaction however as the mass ratio of zvi to bc rose to 6 1 the removal efficiency and removal capacity decreased to 52 20 and 315 69 mg g 1 this result was due to the aggregation of zvi as the mass ratio improved from 1 6 to 6 1 the content of zvi was 0 048 g l 1 0 066 g l 1 0 111 g l 1 0 167 g l 1 0 222 g l 1 0 266 g l 1 0 285 g l 1 the benefit of wmf were 43 57 34 71 16 37 10 67 5 31 3 01 and 2 23 respectively this showed that as the content of zvi increased the benefit of wmf decreased with wmf cr vi removal efficiency and capacity by bm zvi bc and bm zvi were improved particularly noticeable was the 40 74 and 43 57 increase in removal capacity for bm zvi and bm zvi bc 1 6 at ph 2 respectively furthermore the cr vi removal trend by bm zvi bc wmf under different zvi to bc mass ratios was the same as that without wmf moreover the cr vi removal capacities of bm bc bm bc wmf bm zvi bm zvi wmf bm zvi bc and bm zvi bc wmf were compared cr vi removal by zvi was enhanced by wmf and was further enhanced by loading bc this result indicates that bc and wmf could effectively increase cr vi removal by zvi through synergistic effects the subsequent experiment used a mass ratio of 4 1 3 3 the effects of ball milling time of bm zvi bc on the removal of cr vi without wmf removal efficiency and capacity of cr vi increased gradually from 37 12 and 223 49 mg g 1 to 59 92 and 362 41 mg g 1 when the ball milling time was extended from 0 5 h to 1 5 h fig 3 c however with the further increase of the milling time the removal effect of cr vi by bm zvi bc wmf decreased there are two reasons for the reduction of removal effect 1 the size of bm zvi bc was too small to result in agglomeration 2 the bc particle size is too small to effectively support zvi resulting in a large number of zvi particles broke away from bc and formed passivation layer with wmf the removal efficiency and capacity of bm zvi bc to cr vi were improved at a ball milling time of 1 5 h the removal capacity and removal increased to 62 39 and 377 29 mg g 1 ball milling time of 1 5 h was used for subsequent experiments 3 4 the effects of initial ph on the removal of cr vi with and without wmf the removal efficiency and capacity of bm zvi bc for cr vi decreased with the increase of ph ph 2 8 fig 4 a indicating that removal of cr vi was more accessible with a lower ph solution this result is caused by the following reasons 1 fig 4 b shows that ph increased after reduction of cr vi at various initial ph suggesting that h was expended during reduction of cr vi thus a higher concentration of h made the transformation of cr vi to cr iii easier 35 2 according to previous studies cr vi mainly existed in the form of hcro4 ph 1 6 cr2o7 2 ph 6 0 7 5 and cro4 2 ph 6 0 17 compared with forms of cr2o7 2 and cro4 2 hcro4 was advantageous to electrostatic adsorption due to its lower adsorption free energy 3 when the ph was lower than point of zero charge fig 4 c the bm zvi bc surface was positively charged thereby enhancing the electrostatic adsorption between cr vi anions and the surface of the material 5 4 the total iron ion content of reaction solution was extremely low when ph 7 fig 4 b because there was not enough h to dissolve fe0 and the oxides 36 leading to surface passivation of bm zvi bc in addition with wmf more fe ions were produced after the reaction indicating that wmf promoted the corrosion of fe0 21 thus acidic conditions proved to be favorable for cr vi removal the increase in cr vi removal capacity by wmf was only 5 67 at initial ph 2 at ph 3 8 the increase was relatively significant especially the removal capacity of bm zvi bc wmf to cr vi increased by about 126 03 at ph 5 from 18 02 mg g 1 to 40 73 mg g 1 the results showed a more remarkable wmf promotion effect at higher ph the promotion of wmf tended to increase and then decrease with rising ph which might be due to the development of a passivation layer at higher ph 28 3 5 the effects of dosage of bm zvi bc on the removal of cr vi when the bm zvi bc dosage was added from 0 2 g l 1 to 1 g l 1 removal efficiency was improved from 31 35 to 100 fig 4 d this may be due to the increased contact area of bm zvi bc with cr vi in solution resulting in more reactive sites on the composite being involved in the reaction then cr vi removal efficiency remained constant with increasing dosage however the removal capacity of bm zvi bc wmf to cr vi showed an increasing and then decreasing trend with dosage addition reaching 378 05 mg g 1 at the dosage of 0 333 g l 1 at this dosage the utilization of the composite material was maximized for practical applications a dose of 1 g l 1 should be chosen to achieve 100 removal however subsequent experiments in this study needed to calculate the extent to which wmf enhanced cr vi removal so instead of using 1 g l 1 0 333 g l 1 was chosen 3 6 reaction kinetics the data of removal of cr vi in bm zvi bc and bm zvi bc wmf systems were fitted with the pseudo first order kinetics model fig s3 r 2 0 9 20 37 38 1 ln c 0 c t k obs t where c 0 is the initial concentration of the substance c t the concentration of the substance at time t min and the apparent rate constant k obs min 1 the k obs increased from 0 185 min 1 to 0 221 min 1 further indicating that the wmf accelerated the reduction of cr vi 3 7 effects of aging time the material is exposed to air for a period to produce an oxide film which is a frequent aging phenomenon of zvi materials in this study bm zvi bc was exposed to air for 30 d and compared with fresh bm zvi bc to investigate the effect of aging time on the removal capacity of the material to cr vi as shown in fig 5 the removal capacity of bm zvi bc to cr vi decreased from 358 66 mg g 1 to 221 32 mg g 1 after 30 days of aging the removal capacity of bm zvi bc wmf to cr vi decreased from 373 45 mg g 1 to 286 55 mg g 1 retaining a higher removal capacity than the bm zvi bc system the result showed that the reaction activity of aged bm zvi bc was significantly reduced which could be attributed to the oxide film on the surface of bm zvi bc masking the redox active sites 20 however this effect was significantly reduced by the wmf 3 8 mechanism analysis 3 8 1 chromium species determination xrd after reaction and xps analysis the removal mechanism of cr vi was further investigated by measuring the concentrations of various classes of chromium in different reaction systems during the reaction with bm bc bm zvi bm zvi bc and bm zvi bc wmf the concentrations of different kinds of cr are shown in fig 6 the results showed that almost no cr iii was produced in the bm bc system and the total chromium and cr vi concentrations decreased to 17 66 mg l 1 fig 6 a therefore bm bc removed cr vi by adsorption in the bm zvi system fig 6 b 1 97 mg l 1 cr iii was produced but the total chromium content did not change significantly therefore bm zvi mainly removed cr vi by reduction the final cr iii concentration in bm zvi bc and bm zvi bc wmf system reached 16 20 mg l 1 fig 6 c and 14 50 mg l 1 fig 6 d indicating that cr vi was reduced in addition the significant decrease in cr vi concentration during the first 1 h could be attributed to the simultaneous occurrence of adsorption and reduction reactions as shown in fig s4 bm zvi bc showed new characteristic peaks on the xrd after the reaction firstly the characteristic peaks of the masked biochar reappeared due to the depletion of zvi from the material surface in addition characteristic peaks for fecr2o4 cr2o3 fe2o3 fe3o4 were detected indicating that cr vi was reduced to cr iii and formed precipitation of fecr oxides with fe iii 26 39 40 fig 7 shows the xps spectrum of bm zvi bc and bm zvi bc wmf before and after the reaction the main elements before the reaction are c o and fe and the main elements after the reaction are c o fe and cr as shown in fig 7 a peaks of c 1s o 1s and fe 2p were present before reaction and cr 2p peaks appeared after reaction confirming the involvement of the chemisorption process in cr vi removal 24 for fe 2p fig 7 b the fe 2p spectrum in bm zvi bc before reaction has five peaks near 706 8 ev 710 95 ev 713 24 ev 719 73 ev and 724 6 ev corresponding to fe0 fe2o3 fe ii satellite fe iii satellite and feooh 36 respectively in the absence of wmf the peak of fe0 disappeared after reaction the relative content of the fe ii satellite decreased from 23 9 to 15 5 and fe2o3 fe iii and feooh increased these results indicated that fe0 fe ii was oxidized to fe ii fe iii during the reaction 41 with wmf fe ii satellite fe iii satellite and feooh decreased from 15 5 6 5 and 32 5 to 11 8 2 9 and 30 4 respectively and fe2o3 increased from 45 5 and to 54 9 as shown in fig 7 c with the presence or absence of wmf the peaks near 577 22 ev and 587 55 ev were attributed to cr iii and the peak near 579 79 ev and 588 85 ev belonged to cr vi 42 the results showed that chromium was mainly present as cr iii after the reaction with a little cr vi with wmf the percentage of cr iii increased from 78 2 to 87 6 in summary the presence of wmf did not alter the reaction mechanism but increased the reduction efficiency of cr vi 3 8 2 removal mechanism the removal mechanisms of bm zvi bc wmf to cr vi are shown in fig 8 the process of removal involved adsorption reduction and co precipitation with reduction playing a key role 1 cr vi was adsorbed on the surface of bm zvi bc due to high porosity and specific surface area and then removed 35 2 cr vi was reduced to cr iii by electrons supplied from fe0 and fe2 eqs 2 3 and 4 43 with wmf the magnetization of zvi induced mf on its surface and produced a magnetic gradient force f b 29 44 by the force of f b the paramagnetic fe2 moved along the magnetic lines of force towards the higher magnetic flux strength of the mf such that a concentration gradient of fe2 was formed in addition this fe2 concentration gradient produced an additional driving force acting on the reaction mixture in solution this force will lead to a redistribution of velocities in the diffusion layer this ultimately will accelerate the dissolution of iron facilitating the reaction and slowing down the deposition of ferrous hydroxide on the bm zvi bc surface 45 3 finally cr iii was present in the form of cr1 xfex oh 3 eq 5 41 2 2 hcr o 4 14 h 3 f e 0 2 c r 3 3 f e 2 8 h 2 o 3 hcr o 4 7 h 3 f e 2 c r 3 4 h 2 o 3 f e 3 4 c r 2 o 7 2 14 h 2 f e 0

practical applications water from ge lake changzhou china was collected to prepare cr vi solution and then treated with bm zvi bc wmf table 1 shows the parameters of the cr vi solution of the actual environmental matrix before and after treatment where the removal efficiency of cr vi reached 99 0 and the remaining concentration has been lower than the chinese emission standard 0 5 mg l 1 reaction conditions dosage 0 333 g l 1 reaction time 1 h and temperature 25 c 4 conclusion in this study a combination of wmf zvi and biochar was used to remove cr vi with excellent results the removal of cr vi by bm zvi bc synthesized via the ball milling method was much more effective than zvi or bc alone bc effectively disperses zvi as a carrier and improves reactivity of zvi acidic conditions favored the removal of cr vi by bm zvi bc wmf increased the removal capacity of bm zvi bc to cr vi enhanced aging resistance and accelerated reaction rate moreover the effect of wmf on cr vi removal capacity enhancement was related to the content in zvi which showed an increasing and then decreasing trend with the growth of zvi content reduction was the main mechanism to remove cr vi the positive effect of wmf is attributed to the production of f b in conclusion the combination of wmf biochar and zvi has potential in the removal of cr vi credit authorship contribution statement sihai zhou
