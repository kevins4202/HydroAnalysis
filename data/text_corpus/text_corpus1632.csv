8160,study region south korea kr ulsan tidal river study focus climate change and urbanization pose a serious threat to rising water levels and flooding in the estuary region in particular tidal river which is located in the estuary area is impacted by many hydrological factors such as tide wave height and rainfall this paper develops a new rating curve that can predict the water level of the tidal river it also assesses the accuracy of the developed rating curve through the verification event new hydrological insights tidal rivers show non linear hydrological characteristics that are influenced by various hydrological factors thus no rating curve has been developed for them this study proposes a method to develop a rating curve that can estimate the water level by using the runoff from rainfall in a tidal river to develop the rating curve the water level at ulsan station korea was decomposed into four components which are tide wave noise and runoff component by using wavelet analysis curve fitting and a high pass filter a distributed grid based rainfall runoff model grm was applied to simulate the runoff the simulated runoff and the water level components influenced by rainfall were used to develop a rating curve and estimate the water level from the simulated runoff the results were then added to the other three components tide wave noise to calculate an integrated water level which was compared with the observed water level at ulsan station with less than 10 error during validation the results are expected to contribute to the accurate prediction of water level of tidal river during flood season keywords tidal river rating curve grm model wavelet analysis 1 introduction more than 90 of the world population lives in northern hemisphere and more than 50 of them live in coastal areas which are more vulnerable to flooding than inland areas mart√≠nez et al 2007 climate change causes sea level rises and coastal erosion which are predicted to cause the loss of 86 600 houses and buildings within 60 years in north carolina platt salvesen et al 2002 in addition more natural disasters are expected to occur due to the increase of heavy rainfall and typhoons for instance the southeastern coast of the state of florida has been severely devastated as it was hit by hurricane katrina in 2005 and hurricane sandy in 2012 ebersole et al 2010 cody et al 2017 thus an accurate prediction of water level and discharge is required to mitigate the flood damage in south korea flood warnings are issued at 65 water level stations located in the national rivers however no disaster management has been established specifically in coastal areas tidal rivers located in coastal areas are influenced by tides which are caused by the interaction between the sun and the moon because of the reverse flow caused by tides fluctuation of water level and discharge takes place lee et al 2018 emphasized that serious flood damage could occur because of high tides precisely in 2016 during typhoon chaba the taehwa river in ulsan korea was affected by high tides causing major flood damage in 2018 during typhoon jebi kansai international airport in japan was inundated because the highest tidal level occurred during this event which caused a poor drainage takabatake et al 2018 to reduce these aforementioned flood damages caused by natural disasters many studies are currently being conducted to protect human lives and assets le coz et al 2014 tried to identify the relation between the water level and discharge they introduced a method called baratin to analyze the normality of the rating curve by using bayesian inference and applied it to three contrasted application case the results suggested the necessity of in depth analysis of the hydraulic control and quantification of measurement uncertainty to secure reliable results westerberg et al 2011 performed a weighted fuzzy regression analysis of a rating curve and calculated the discharge they suggested that higher temporal variations in the stage discharge relationship were found at low discharge namgung et al 2011 used the unet model to analyze non steady flows and conducted a numerical analysis to compare the flow velocity with the water level in a non flooding season on the other hand kwon and kim 2012 applied bayesian mcmc markov chain monte carlo to estimate the posterior distribution of parameters of a rating curve and evaluated their uncertainty mansanarez et al 2016 used stage fall discharge sfd rating curve to compute streamflow records and accounted for transition between a backwater affected control and a backwater unaffected control using bayesian approach these studies are mainly about developing a rating curve in general rivers and analyzing their uncertainty other studies kim et al 2015 lewis et al 2019 gopalan et al 2020 have been conducted for the development of rating curves in a tidal river hidayat et al 2014 developed an artificial neural network ann model to predict the water level in a tidal river using the water level at the upstream of the tidal river and tide level data however the model obtained showed a good performance for predictions up to 2 days only song et al 2014 developed a numerical model to examine the reverse flow according to the discharge of a tidal river they used the seven different discharge cases for simulations that is changing the discharge from a normal discharge to 2000 m3 s the results showed that the higher discharge caused the more fluctuation of runoff which led to less reverse flow and higher flow velocity of the main stream camenen et al 2021 proposes a low cost technique to estimate river discharge at high frequency using a sfd rating curve adapted from the general manning strickler law in a tidal river since the water level in a tidal river is affected by discharge from rainfall and coastal components such as tide and wave height it is difficult to clearly develop the stage discharge curve in korea the acoustic doppler velocity meter advm is used to measure the water level of tidal river in real time however it has a limitation in flood warning and forecasting because it simply monitors the water level and the flow velocity without considering its relation with discharge when the flow is reversed the value of the discharge becomes negative because the measured flow velocity is affected by the tide hence it is necessary to identify the factors influencing the water level of a tidal river and develop a stage discharge relation curve actually it is necessary to estimate the high water level affected by rainfall for flood forecasting rather than the low water level affected by coastal hydrological components this is why this study decomposes the water level of tidal river and develops a rating curve to measure the water level affected by rainfall therefore this study developed a stage discharge curve in a tidal river to predict the variability of high water level caused by rainfall 2 study area the analysis was conducted by using the water level from ulsan gauge stations that are located in the taehwa river south korea the basin area is 660 86 km2 and the average slope of the basin is 16 7 the length of river is 309 12 km and the shape factor which is defined as the ratio between watershed periphery and area is 0 72 which shows a characteristic that peak runoff can occur in a short period of time cho and jeon 2010 the ulsan sea surface level station is located at the end of the downstream area while the guyeong water level station is located at the upstream zone where it is unaffected by tides fig 1 therefore the study area is deemed suitable for applying and verifying the proposed methodology there are two rainfall stations located in taehwa river basin as shown in fig 1 and biseul mountain radar station is located near the basin rainfall data were obtained from a radar station that has been operated since 2010 on biseul mountain located near the basin the biseul mountain radar is a dual polarized radar that was first introduced in south korea this radar is mostly used to support flood forecasting for the nakdong river basin jeon et al 2012 ahn et al 2015 hourly data for the ulsan water level series and ulsan sea surface level series were obtained from january 1 2011 to december 31 2018 the time series from the ulsan water level station has a typical tidal river s characteristics which shows fluctuations at a low water level and steep rises and decreases during flood events on the other hand the time series of ulsan sea surface levels have a small range of fluctuations and have a mixture of periodic and non periodic components fig 2 guyeong station which is not affected by tide generally measures water level and velocity using a propeller velocimetry and float type velocimetry ulsan station which is affected by tide measures the water level and velocity continuously using adv acoustic doppler velocimetry that can consider tide effect 3 development of rating curve for tidal river 3 1 procedure for establishing a rating curve in tidal river it is difficult to estimate the relationship between the total discharge q and the total water level h because the total water level h in tidal river is highly influenced by coastal hydrological components such as tide and wave height at low water level the low water level in tidal river can be estimated using tide data and the lag time for it but in the case of high water levels caused by rainfall there is no way to distinct the effect of discharge by rainfall from the other effect the hydrological model can only simulate the runoff discharge on ground basin but it cannot simulate the total runoff discharge in tidal river affected by the coastal components therefore this study decomposed the water level in tidal river into four components tide wave rainfall runoff noise and developed the rating curve using simulated discharge s q and rainfall runoff component r h a method proposed by lee et al 2018 was used to classify the water level of a tidal river into four different components tide wave rainfall runoff noise a distributed grid based rainfall runoff model grm was then applied to obtain rainfall runoff component see fig 3 because the tide and wave height have a great influence on low water level in tidal river their components were extracted from the sea surface level data by using wavelet and curve fitting method the two separated components were subtracted from the water level and a high pass filter was used to separate the noise component which shows a high frequency a grm model was simulated for estimating the simulated discharge s q and the relation between the simulated discharge s q and decomposed rainfall runoff component r h of water level was derived finally the simulated discharge s q was converted to rainfall runoff component r h and the water level was estimated by adding three others components to r h the results were compared with observation data for validation 3 2 decomposition of the water level of a tidal river decomposition of the water level time series of a tidal river is separating the sea level component from the water level and separating the noise component of the remaining water level using a filtering technique the sea surface level data can roughly be divided into two components which are tide and wave height components the tide component can be classified into three groups a short term component for two occurrences per day semi diurnal tide period is 12 h 25 min a mid term component for 14 75 days periods high tide and low tide and a long term component for the 1 year period which includes the inverse barometer effect this effect makes the sea surface level higher in the summer season and lower in the winter season fig 4 shows the procedure of tidal river s water level decomposition a wavelet analysis was used to divide between the short term and mid term components and a curve fitting function was applied to separate the 1 year long term component unlike a frequency spectrum analysis a wavelet analysis includes time information therefore wavelet analysis is easy to use when analyzing a spectrum s properties with changing time and the irregular temporal status of waves kwon et al 2003 wang et al 2000 in the case of fourier conversion a new base domain consists of basis sine cosine or exponential functions while a wavelet analysis is composed of new basis functions called mother wavelets arens et al 1982 extension to the temporal domain from the frequency domain is a major factor that explains the abnormal status the mother wavelet indicates œà t which is used as a basis function for wavelet conversion 1 œà j k t 1 j œà t k j j k r eq 1 represents the scaling and translation of the basis function eq 1 uses a wavelet function that shifts the mother wavelet by k and changes its scale by j variable j is a value that determines the scaling k is a value that determines how much the function shifts and r is a function space and the pair j k defines a point in the right half plane r r the optimal frequency and period of sea level data can be extracted while changing the values of the scaling variable j and the shifting variable k of the wavelet function curve fitting is a method to obtain the most ideal mathematical straight line or curve that can reflect the data this method is widely used in science and engineering for experimental data analysis statistics and automation technologies in particular it has received great attention since the 1980s with the rapid development of computers in this study a multinomial interpolation technique based on sine functions was used to separate the long term component which has a constant vibration cycle like a trigonometric function 2 f t Œ± 1 s i n Œ≤ 1 x Œ≥ 1 Œ± 2 s i n Œ≤ 2 x Œ≥ 2 Œ± n s i n Œ≤ n x Œ≥ n in these equations Œ± i is the amplitude Œ≤ i is the period and Œ≥ i is translation coefficient the variable i means the component of sine function from 1 to n and the number of n can be calculated through statistical comparison between the observed values and the values generated from curve fitting a filter analysis method was used to separate the two remaining components this limits the noise of a signal in a desired frequency range to eliminate undesired parts from the frequency spectrum a high pass filter was used for the separation of noise component in this study 3 3 estimation of discharge with the grm model this study estimates the simulated discharge s q using grm which is a distributed hydrological model to simulate the discharge that affects the water level of tidal river when rainfall occurs grm is a physics based distributed model that is developed by the korea institute of civil engineering and building technology choi et al 2016 the grm provides a gis based modeling system called hygis grm and applies a one dimension kinematic wave equation for a flood routing of runoff of the ground surface and stream channel the continuity equations are 3 h t q x r f q r Œ¥ y 4 a t q x r Œ¥ y q o l q s s q b the kinematic wave equation is expressed as follows 5 s o s f from eq 5 the channel bed slope can be used instead of the friction slope to calculate the flow velocity with manning s flow velocity equation the flow velocity is calculated using manning s equation choi et al 2012 2015 6 u r 2 3 s 0 1 2 n in above equations q is the discharge per unit width q u h m 3 s u is the flow velocity in the x direction m s r is the rainfall intensity m m f is the infiltration rate variable a is the cross sectional area of the stream channel k m 2 q r is the returning flow m 3 s wherein a forms a right angle with the x direction q is the total discharge m 3 s h is the water depth m q o l is the side inflow m 3 s due to surface ground flow q s s is the underground runoff flowing into stream channel m 3 s and q b is the base flow m 3 s the variable t is time s o is channel bed slope s f is friction slope n is the roughness coefficient r is the mean hydraulic radius and Œ¥ y is the size of the control volume in the y direction surface flow and infiltration can be simulated using eqs 3 6 the total discharge is calculated by adding the discharge derived from the overland flow channel flow and the subsurface flow a 30 m 30 m grid was used to construct the parameters for the topography and ground coverage including a dem land cover map and soil map grm provides the channel width equation as eq 7 7 b 1 698 a u p 0 50 s o 0 5 in equation b is the channel width km a u p is upstream area km2 and s o is the channel bed slope using this equation channel cross section is calculated since the grm model is a distributed model the correction of topographic parameters can be performed by multiplying each grid as a ratio and a different parameter value can be applied to each sub basin the parameters include the initial soil saturation ratio and minimum slope of channel bed for the sub basin a minimum channel width and channel roughness for the stream the calibration coefficients of parameters include land cover roughness coefficient soil depth soil porosity soil wetting front and soil hydraulic conductivity the model can be calibrated by multiplying the correction coefficients by the value of topographical variables for each grid 3 4 development of stage discharge relation curve of tidal river continuous monitoring is needed for the water levels and discharge in a river but there are technical and financial limitations thus a stage discharge curve is developed based on observed data to calculate the discharge for a specific water level the curve is generally expressed as a power function or in a parabolic function in this study the power function equation was used as shown in eq 8 8 q a h b c in these equations q is the discharge m 3 s h is water level m and a b c are constants the constants are site specific and depend on geometrical characteristics and hydraulic controls and decided in different ways such as a trial and error method direct method regression analysis or bayesian method le coz et al 2014 when the discharge increases due to rainfall a graph could be drawn for a logarithmic scale between rainfall runoff component and the simulated discharge and a trend line of the power function can be obtained as shown in eq 8 in this equation a and c can be calculated from the graph but the constant b should be calculated according to the characteristics of the water level station as shown in aforementioned equation the parameter b has to be adjusted to solve the problem when the discharge become zero the shape of the equation varies greatly when b is adjusted some studies johnson 1952 gopalan et al 2020 have suggested a method for estimating the parameter b johnson 1952 presented a method to estimate parameter b graphically the procedure and usgs has been used this method since 1982 kim et al 2015 in this study the parameter b was estimated using direct method which is suggested by john as shown in fig 5 since the purpose of this study is to develop a rating curve between ground discharge that occurs in the tidal river basin and water level when it rains simulated discharge s q from the grm model and rainfall runoff component r h from water level decomposition were used 4 application to taehwa river basin 4 1 decomposition of water level in a tidal river the water level of ulsan station is greatly influenced by tides sea surface level is affected by the movement of the moon and sun which shows deterministic characteristics unlike the hydrologic data for precipitation and water levels the wave height is a stochastic component that causes uncertainty in the deterministic characteristics of the sea surface level the wavelet analysis using hourly data resulted in 10 15 hours as periodic components were meaningfully extracted for the short term while 14 17 days of periodic components were extracted from daily data as mid term components see fig 6 the short term and mid term components of the tide data are greatly affected by the moon s gravity force however the 1 year long term component shows a characteristic where the sea surface level becomes higher in the summer and lower in the winter due to the influence of the earth s revolution around the sun the long term component can be extracted through the wavelet analysis however there are some limitations in using the analysis for separating the component of a 1 year period since 8 years data were used only therefore the curve fitting function was used to extract the long term component with the sum of the sine functions 9 l o n g p e r i o d c o m p o n e n t 12 56 sin 0 00004 t 0 161 11 43 sin 0 00004 t 3 233 0 175 sin 0 5059 t 1 004 0 0189 sin 0 00002 t 0 826 0 122 sin 0 0007 t 2 366 0 082 s i n 0 524 t 2 861 since tidal data are deterministic long period component was simulated by using the six periodic components in form of sine functions in fact tide is predicted with high accuracy using harmonic analysis which is obtained as the sum of 64 periodic functions park 2018 in this study 6 components corresponding to the long term components of the 64 components were used to simulate the former see eq 9 the correlation coefficient between the long period component and the observed sea surface level is 0 89 which indicates that the long period component simulates the pattern of the observed tide data well the tide component can be explained with the sum of the short term mid term and long term components while the difference between the tide component and the observed sea surface level data can be explained by the wave height component the components for rainfall runoff and noise remain after tide and wave height components are subtracted from the water level series of the ulsan gauge station a high pass filter function was used to separate the non periodic component rainfall runoff that occurs with rainfall events and the noise component finally the water level series of the ulsan gauge station was divided into 4 components tide wave height noise and rainfall runoff components as shown in fig 7 the zoom graph in fig 7 shows the time series of total water level and tide component during typhoon chaba the event caused heavy rainfall over 300 mm and strong winds over 35 m s the tide component showing deterministic characteristics was observed to be higher than the high tide because the wave height increased influenced by typhoon invasion 4 2 estimation of discharge with the grm model 4 2 1 hydrological parameters grm was used to estimate the discharge that occurs with a rainfall event jodong station guyeong station and ulsan water level station are located in taehwa river basin the grm was reconstructed for each water level station as an outlet point of the sub basin and the model was simulated by estimating the discharge of each station see fig 8 the grm makes it possible to set parameters for each sub basins it is a distributed rainfall runoff model based on grids so it requires layers in the form of raster as the input data the topography data in the taehwa river basin were built using a 30 m 30 m dem data land cover and soil map with the same resolution as the dem were applied to construct for grm simulation see fig 9 4 2 2 radar rainfall and runoff simulation the event of typhoon chaba on october 6 2016 which caused huge damage in the taehwa river basin was selected as a calibration event and the localized heavy rainfall event on october 6 2018 was used as a validation event for grm model s simulation the terrain grid and radar rainfall grid should have the same resolution therefore the radar rainfall was resampled to 30 m 30 m since the resolution of the original radar rainfall data are 150 m 150 m to confirm the accuracy of radar rainfall estimation rainfall comparison with two rainfall gauge stations located in the taehwa river basin was performed as shown in fig 10 the results showed that the radar rainfall and ground rainfall exhibit almost the same values in the calibration event and the radar rainfall is underestimated than the ground rainfall in the validation event however when compared with rainfall intensity radar rainfall and ground rainfall exhibit similar values so runoff analysis was performed using radar data that can reflect spatial characteristics figs 11 and 12 show the rainfall s movement for the calibration event the rainfall moves in a north easterly direction which is the same traveling path of the typhoon for the validation event the summer monsoonal front makes the rainfall move to the south east both events show the same features of rainfall traveling from upstream to downstream leading to a higher discharge at the water level stations located in the downstream the runoff analysis was performed by using the radar data as the input rainfall for the grm since the grm model is a distributed model calibration of the model can be performed for each grid for example the soil permeability coefficient has different values for each grid depending on the soil map so the grm model can correct this for each grid by applying a calibration coefficient in this study the model was calibrated by trial and error method using calibration coefficient such as land cover roughness coefficient soil depth soil porosity soil wetting front and soil hydraulic conductivity figs 13 and 14 and table 1 show the results of the runoff analysis for calibration event and validation event the performance of the grm model was statistically evaluated using root mean square error rmse see eq 10 nash sutcliffe coefficients nsc eq 11 and mean absolute error mae eq 12 as shown in table 2 the grm model was calibrated to simulate the peak discharge well and the peak discharge error is shown in table 1 10 r m s e 1 n i 1 n q o i q s i 2 11 n s c 1 i 1 n q o i q s i 2 i 1 n q o i q o 2 12 m a e 1 n i 1 n q o i q s i in these equations q o i q s i are the observed and simulated discharge m 3 s at the i t h time q o is the average observed discharge m 3 s and n is the duration of each event the discharge of jodong station and guyeong station were simulated well showing a peak discharge difference of less than 30 m 3 s an 8 error compared with peak discharge however the discharge of ulsan station was underestimated about 500 m 3 s an 15 error compared with peak discharge which is affected by the tide as shown in table 1 mae of jodong and guyoung stations has a low error of less than 70 m 3 s but ulsan station shows a high error of 100 m 3 s or more in both calibration and validation events also in the case of rmse which imposes a high penalty where a large error occurs ulsan station shows a higher error about 100 m 3 s or more than other stations in general river like jodong and guyeong stations the simulated discharge equals the observed discharge since two stations is no more influenced by tide in contrast ulsan station is influenced by tide which shows the limitations in estimating the discharge and water level in a tidal river the nash sutcliffe coefficients of the grm model simulated at three stations are more than 0 8 confirming that the model is well constructed the reason for the significant difference between the simulated discharge and observed discharge from ulsan station is that the observed discharge is based on doppler method and converted from the flow velocity thus it is affected by many hydrological factors including discharge so the observed discharge can be higher than the simulation result of the grm ulsan station is located in the tidal river therefore the flow velocity and the discharge changes with the tide level since the amount of the observed discharge is found to be huge there is a need to establish the relationship between the simulated discharge by the grm and the rainfall runoff component the converted water level is added to the other three components to estimate the water level of the tidal river 4 3 development of stage discharge relation curve of tidal river a stage discharge curve is developed by using the rainfall runoff component obtained by the water level time series in ulsan station and the discharge simulated by the grm see fig 5 for the procedure the middle point q 3 of the curve is calculated as shown in fig 5 the value of b is estimated by obtaining h 3 corresponding to q 3 as shown in eqs 13 and 14 13 q 3 q 1 q 2 38 42 1814 09 264 002 m 3 s 14 b h 1 h 2 h 3 2 h 1 h 2 2 h 3 0 096 4 218 0 452 2 0 096 4 218 2 0 452 0 05904 the water level discharge relationship was developed using typhoon chaba as a calibration event the calculated b was added to the water level to draw a graph that shows the relation with the discharge fig 15 the stage discharge relation curve was obtained for the ulsan station as shown in eq 15 in this equation q is the discharge m 3 s simulated by the grm and r h is the separated rainfall runoff component for the ulsan water level station to verify the obtained curve we used the simulated discharge data to fig 15 and obtained r h before adding it to the other components tide wave height and noise for comparison with the observed water level the results of combined components and observed water level are figs 16 and 17 and table 2 in the calibration event the simulated water level was higher than the observed level by 0 27 m an 3 6 error compared with peak level as shown in fig 16 the simulation of the observed water level showed a great performance the accuracy of the calculated rating curve was reviewed using a localized heavy rainfall event as a validation event and the results presented almost the same as the observed water level fig 17 both of the events had about 10 normalized root mean square error nrmse a root mean square error rmse of about 0 18 m and nash sutcliffe coefficients nsc of 0 97 these results indicate a high accuracy of the simulation table 2 also the low water level is well simulated through tide and wave height components when the water level rises with the occurrence of rainfall the result shows that the simulated water level has a similar value to the observed water level 5 discussion the aim of proposed methodology is to estimate how much the discharge influenced by rainfall affects the increase in the water level in tidal river rating curve are mainly developed in general river where there is a linear relationship between rainfall and discharge clarke 1999 dottori et al 2009 gopalan et al 2020 for general rivers a rating curve can be used to predict the water level for forecasting as shown in fig 18 but this is not the case for a tidal river since its characteristics are non linear if the relation between discharge and water level cannot be defined it is hard to identify the extent on how much the water level rises from the runoff as shown in fig 18 as known the water level in tidal river rises not only due to the influence of tide but also due to the influence of wind caused by typhoons lewis et al 2019 investigated the role of tidal dynamics in the nearshore wave climate and found that the risk of flooding is greater because tidal dynamics alter the wave climate propagating into the coast therefore to understand how the discharge by rainfall affects the water level the rating curve is developed using separated rainfall runoff components and grm discharge as a result the tide component mainly affects the water level at low water levels it was also found that the rainfall runoff component plays a major role in raising the water level the prediction accuracy of the tide component is high because it has deterministic characteristics however it is hard to define the relationship between the discharge and the water level in the tidal river as shown in fig 19 the risk of flood damage in coastal areas is increasing due to rising sea levels storm surges and heavy rainfall due to climate change buchanan et al 2016 despite the increasing hydrological hazards such as tide and storm surge risk management in coastal areas is performed only through real time monitoring if the methodology presented in this study is used the water level of the tidal river can be predicted using forecasting data such as tide wave height and rainfall the results of this study can be used as a basic data for disaster management in coastal areas this study attempted to estimate the discharge by rainfall in the tidal river and convert the discharge to water level however the effect of the actual tide and wave height in the tidal river is underestimated because the distance between water level station and estuary is far in other words the lag time according to the distance and the swelling effect by high wind speed are not considered since the water level station is located far from the estuary to solve the first problem scale adjustment is performed using the average and standard deviation of the tide and wave height data located in the estuary and the average and standard deviation of the decomposed tide and wave height components on the other hand the latter was solved by means of using the water level station located in an inland zone rather than a coastal area so it is not significantly affected by wind speed the purpose of this study is to understand how much discharge by rainfall affects the water level rather than the effect of tide and wave height when compared with the previous study jo et al 2000 which developed a rating curve without decomposition of water level the results of this study improved r 2 0 3 and the standard error 0 2 m in future studies better results will be derived if the water level observatory located near the estuary will be used to quantify the effects of tide and wave height another limitation of this study is that the researchers did not consider the change of the bed level profile and the roughness coefficient the bed level profile and roughness coefficients are changing during the rainy and dry season but in this study the rainy season was selected as the target event therefore the same values were used in the future this study could be improved by analyzing different water levels based on bed level profile and roughness coefficient both during rainy and dry season if the rating curve suggested in this study is used the discharge caused by rainfall can be converted into water level and the water level of the tidal river can be predicted 6 conclusion this study presents a novel method of a rating curve for the accurate estimation of water levels in tidal river which are influenced by a number of hydrological factors this is the first study to develop a rating curve by separating the water level into four components tide wave rainfall runoff noise and simulating the discharge generated by rainfall a wavelet analysis curve fitting function and high pass filter were used to divide the water levels into different components the development of a stage discharge curve required the estimation of runoff caused by a rainfall event therefore a discharge was simulated by the grm after constructing sub basins with water level gauging stations as outlets as a result jodong and guyeong stations which are not influenced by tide showed good performance in simulating the observed discharge however ulsan station which is affected by the tide have an underestimated discharge to solve this problem a separated rainfall runoff component and the simulated discharge by the grm were used to develop a stage discharge curve the discharge simulated by the grm was converted into the water level by using the curve and then added to the other components tide wave height and noise components to estimate the tidal river level for the two events the water level simulation showed greater performance with less than 10 error the stage discharge curve in a tidal river could significantly contribute to understanding the non linear properties the results could be used for predicting water levels from discharge in consideration of other components to efficiently manage tidal rivers water levels during flooding seasons there are several limitations in this study discharge affected by rainfall could be simulated through grm suggested in this study however discharge due to tidal effects cannot be estimated in order to solve this problem a future study will analyze the relationship between the water level and discharge considering the cross section of the river during no rainfall in order to estimate the discharge due to tide in addition since sea level rise caused by climate change makes the effects of tide and wave heights greater it is necessary to advance the rating curve of tidal rivers considering the climate change in future studies if future study to predict the water level of the tidal river using the sea level data at estuary and the runoff data at the upstream is conducted the water level of the tidal stream can be predicted with

analysis curve fitting and a high pass filter a distributed grid based rainfall runoff model grm was applied to simulate the runoff the simulated runoff and the water level components influenced by rainfall were used to develop a rating curve and estimate the water level from the simulated runoff the results were then added to the other three components tide wave noise to calculate an integrated water level which was compared with the observed water level at ulsan station with less than 10 error during validation the results are expected to contribute to the accurate prediction of water level of tidal river during flood season keywords tidal river rating curve grm model wavelet analysis 1 introduction more than 90 of the world population lives in northern hemisphere and more than 50 of them live in coastal areas which are more vulnerable to flooding than inland areas mart√≠nez et al 2007 climate change causes sea level rises and coastal erosion which are predicted to cause the loss of 86 600 houses and buildings within 60 years in north carolina platt salvesen et al 2002 in addition more natural disasters are expected to occur due to the increase of heavy rainfall and typhoons for instance the southeastern coast of the state of florida has been severely devastated as it was hit by hurricane katrina in 2005 and hurricane sandy in 2012 ebersole et al 2010 cody et al 2017 thus an accurate prediction of water level and discharge is required to mitigate the flood damage in south korea flood warnings are issued at 65 water level stations located in the national rivers however no disaster management has been established specifically in coastal areas tidal rivers located in coastal areas are influenced by tides which are caused by the interaction between the sun and the moon because of the reverse flow caused by tides fluctuation of water level and discharge takes place lee et al 2018 emphasized that serious flood damage could occur because of high tides precisely in 2016 during typhoon chaba the taehwa river in ulsan korea was affected by high tides causing major flood damage in 2018 during typhoon jebi kansai international airport in japan was inundated because the highest tidal level occurred during this event which caused a poor drainage takabatake et al 2018 to reduce these aforementioned flood damages caused by natural disasters many studies are currently being conducted to protect human lives and assets le coz et al 2014 tried to identify the relation between the water level and discharge they introduced a method called baratin to analyze the normality of the rating curve by using bayesian inference and applied it to three contrasted application case the results suggested the necessity of in depth analysis of the hydraulic control and quantification of measurement uncertainty to secure reliable results westerberg et al 2011 performed a weighted fuzzy regression analysis of a rating curve and calculated the discharge they suggested that higher temporal variations in the stage discharge relationship were found at low discharge namgung et al 2011 used the unet model to analyze non steady flows and conducted a numerical analysis to compare the flow velocity with the water level in a non flooding season on the other hand kwon and kim 2012 applied bayesian mcmc markov chain monte carlo to estimate the posterior distribution of parameters of a rating curve and evaluated their uncertainty mansanarez et al 2016 used stage fall discharge sfd rating curve to compute streamflow records and accounted for transition between a backwater affected control and a backwater unaffected control using bayesian approach these studies are mainly about developing a rating curve in general rivers and analyzing their uncertainty other studies kim et al 2015 lewis et al 2019 gopalan et al 2020 have been conducted for the development of rating curves in a tidal river hidayat et al 2014 developed an artificial neural network ann model to predict the water level in a tidal river using the water level at the upstream of the tidal river and tide level data however the model obtained showed a good performance for predictions up to 2 days only song et al 2014 developed a numerical model to examine the reverse flow according to the discharge of a tidal river they used the seven different discharge cases for simulations that is changing the discharge from a normal discharge to 2000 m3 s the results showed that the higher discharge caused the more fluctuation of runoff which led to less reverse flow and higher flow velocity of the main stream camenen et al 2021 proposes a low cost technique to estimate river discharge at high frequency using a sfd rating curve adapted from the general manning strickler law in a tidal river since the water level in a tidal river is affected by discharge from rainfall and coastal components such as tide and wave height it is difficult to clearly develop the stage discharge curve in korea the acoustic doppler velocity meter advm is used to measure the water level of tidal river in real time however it has a limitation in flood warning and forecasting because it simply monitors the water level and the flow velocity without considering its relation with discharge when the flow is reversed the value of the discharge becomes negative because the measured flow velocity is affected by the tide hence it is necessary to identify the factors influencing the water level of a tidal river and develop a stage discharge relation curve actually it is necessary to estimate the high water level affected by rainfall for flood forecasting rather than the low water level affected by coastal hydrological components this is why this study decomposes the water level of tidal river and develops a rating curve to measure the water level affected by rainfall therefore this study developed a stage discharge curve in a tidal river to predict the variability of high water level caused by rainfall 2 study area the analysis was conducted by using the water level from ulsan gauge stations that are located in the taehwa river south korea the basin area is 660 86 km2 and the average slope of the basin is 16 7 the length of river is 309 12 km and the shape factor which is defined as the ratio between watershed periphery and area is 0 72 which shows a characteristic that peak runoff can occur in a short period of time cho and jeon 2010 the ulsan sea surface level station is located at the end of the downstream area while the guyeong water level station is located at the upstream zone where it is unaffected by tides fig 1 therefore the study area is deemed suitable for applying and verifying the proposed methodology there are two rainfall stations located in taehwa river basin as shown in fig 1 and biseul mountain radar station is located near the basin rainfall data were obtained from a radar station that has been operated since 2010 on biseul mountain located near the basin the biseul mountain radar is a dual polarized radar that was first introduced in south korea this radar is mostly used to support flood forecasting for the nakdong river basin jeon et al 2012 ahn et al 2015 hourly data for the ulsan water level series and ulsan sea surface level series were obtained from january 1 2011 to december 31 2018 the time series from the ulsan water level station has a typical tidal river s characteristics which shows fluctuations at a low water level and steep rises and decreases during flood events on the other hand the time series of ulsan sea surface levels have a small range of fluctuations and have a mixture of periodic and non periodic components fig 2 guyeong station which is not affected by tide generally measures water level and velocity using a propeller velocimetry and float type velocimetry ulsan station which is affected by tide measures the water level and velocity continuously using adv acoustic doppler velocimetry that can consider tide effect 3 development of rating curve for tidal river 3 1 procedure for establishing a rating curve in tidal river it is difficult to estimate the relationship between the total discharge q and the total water level h because the total water level h in tidal river is highly influenced by coastal hydrological components such as tide and wave height at low water level the low water level in tidal river can be estimated using tide data and the lag time for it but in the case of high water levels caused by rainfall there is no way to distinct the effect of discharge by rainfall from the other effect the hydrological model can only simulate the runoff discharge on ground basin but it cannot simulate the total runoff discharge in tidal river affected by the coastal components therefore this study decomposed the water level in tidal river into four components tide wave rainfall runoff noise and developed the rating curve using simulated discharge s q and rainfall runoff component r h a method proposed by lee et al 2018 was used to classify the water level of a tidal river into four different components tide wave rainfall runoff noise a distributed grid based rainfall runoff model grm was then applied to obtain rainfall runoff component see fig 3 because the tide and wave height have a great influence on low water level in tidal river their components were extracted from the sea surface level data by using wavelet and curve fitting method the two separated components were subtracted from the water level and a high pass filter was used to separate the noise component which shows a high frequency a grm model was simulated for estimating the simulated discharge s q and the relation between the simulated discharge s q and decomposed rainfall runoff component r h of water level was derived finally the simulated discharge s q was converted to rainfall runoff component r h and the water level was estimated by adding three others components to r h the results were compared with observation data for validation 3 2 decomposition of the water level of a tidal river decomposition of the water level time series of a tidal river is separating the sea level component from the water level and separating the noise component of the remaining water level using a filtering technique the sea surface level data can roughly be divided into two components which are tide and wave height components the tide component can be classified into three groups a short term component for two occurrences per day semi diurnal tide period is 12 h 25 min a mid term component for 14 75 days periods high tide and low tide and a long term component for the 1 year period which includes the inverse barometer effect this effect makes the sea surface level higher in the summer season and lower in the winter season fig 4 shows the procedure of tidal river s water level decomposition a wavelet analysis was used to divide between the short term and mid term components and a curve fitting function was applied to separate the 1 year long term component unlike a frequency spectrum analysis a wavelet analysis includes time information therefore wavelet analysis is easy to use when analyzing a spectrum s properties with changing time and the irregular temporal status of waves kwon et al 2003 wang et al 2000 in the case of fourier conversion a new base domain consists of basis sine cosine or exponential functions while a wavelet analysis is composed of new basis functions called mother wavelets arens et al 1982 extension to the temporal domain from the frequency domain is a major factor that explains the abnormal status the mother wavelet indicates œà t which is used as a basis function for wavelet conversion 1 œà j k t 1 j œà t k j j k r eq 1 represents the scaling and translation of the basis function eq 1 uses a wavelet function that shifts the mother wavelet by k and changes its scale by j variable j is a value that determines the scaling k is a value that determines how much the function shifts and r is a function space and the pair j k defines a point in the right half plane r r the optimal frequency and period of sea level data can be extracted while changing the values of the scaling variable j and the shifting variable k of the wavelet function curve fitting is a method to obtain the most ideal mathematical straight line or curve that can reflect the data this method is widely used in science and engineering for experimental data analysis statistics and automation technologies in particular it has received great attention since the 1980s with the rapid development of computers in this study a multinomial interpolation technique based on sine functions was used to separate the long term component which has a constant vibration cycle like a trigonometric function 2 f t Œ± 1 s i n Œ≤ 1 x Œ≥ 1 Œ± 2 s i n Œ≤ 2 x Œ≥ 2 Œ± n s i n Œ≤ n x Œ≥ n in these equations Œ± i is the amplitude Œ≤ i is the period and Œ≥ i is translation coefficient the variable i means the component of sine function from 1 to n and the number of n can be calculated through statistical comparison between the observed values and the values generated from curve fitting a filter analysis method was used to separate the two remaining components this limits the noise of a signal in a desired frequency range to eliminate undesired parts from the frequency spectrum a high pass filter was used for the separation of noise component in this study 3 3 estimation of discharge with the grm model this study estimates the simulated discharge s q using grm which is a distributed hydrological model to simulate the discharge that affects the water level of tidal river when rainfall occurs grm is a physics based distributed model that is developed by the korea institute of civil engineering and building technology choi et al 2016 the grm provides a gis based modeling system called hygis grm and applies a one dimension kinematic wave equation for a flood routing of runoff of the ground surface and stream channel the continuity equations are 3 h t q x r f q r Œ¥ y 4 a t q x r Œ¥ y q o l q s s q b the kinematic wave equation is expressed as follows 5 s o s f from eq 5 the channel bed slope can be used instead of the friction slope to calculate the flow velocity with manning s flow velocity equation the flow velocity is calculated using manning s equation choi et al 2012 2015 6 u r 2 3 s 0 1 2 n in above equations q is the discharge per unit width q u h m 3 s u is the flow velocity in the x direction m s r is the rainfall intensity m m f is the infiltration rate variable a is the cross sectional area of the stream channel k m 2 q r is the returning flow m 3 s wherein a forms a right angle with the x direction q is the total discharge m 3 s h is the water depth m q o l is the side inflow m 3 s due to surface ground flow q s s is the underground runoff flowing into stream channel m 3 s and q b is the base flow m 3 s the variable t is time s o is channel bed slope s f is friction slope n is the roughness coefficient r is the mean hydraulic radius and Œ¥ y is the size of the control volume in the y direction surface flow and infiltration can be simulated using eqs 3 6 the total discharge is calculated by adding the discharge derived from the overland flow channel flow and the subsurface flow a 30 m 30 m grid was used to construct the parameters for the topography and ground coverage including a dem land cover map and soil map grm provides the channel width equation as eq 7 7 b 1 698 a u p 0 50 s o 0 5 in equation b is the channel width km a u p is upstream area km2 and s o is the channel bed slope using this equation channel cross section is calculated since the grm model is a distributed model the correction of topographic parameters can be performed by multiplying each grid as a ratio and a different parameter value can be applied to each sub basin the parameters include the initial soil saturation ratio and minimum slope of channel bed for the sub basin a minimum channel width and channel roughness for the stream the calibration coefficients of parameters include land cover roughness coefficient soil depth soil porosity soil wetting front and soil hydraulic conductivity the model can be calibrated by multiplying the correction coefficients by the value of topographical variables for each grid 3 4 development of stage discharge relation curve of tidal river continuous monitoring is needed for the water levels and discharge in a river but there are technical and financial limitations thus a stage discharge curve is developed based on observed data to calculate the discharge for a specific water level the curve is generally expressed as a power function or in a parabolic function in this study the power function equation was used as shown in eq 8 8 q a h b c in these equations q is the discharge m 3 s h is water level m and a b c are constants the constants are site specific and depend on geometrical characteristics and hydraulic controls and decided in different ways such as a trial and error method direct method regression analysis or bayesian method le coz et al 2014 when the discharge increases due to rainfall a graph could be drawn for a logarithmic scale between rainfall runoff component and the simulated discharge and a trend line of the power function can be obtained as shown in eq 8 in this equation a and c can be calculated from the graph but the constant b should be calculated according to the characteristics of the water level station as shown in aforementioned equation the parameter b has to be adjusted to solve the problem when the discharge become zero the shape of the equation varies greatly when b is adjusted some studies johnson 1952 gopalan et al 2020 have suggested a method for estimating the parameter b johnson 1952 presented a method to estimate parameter b graphically the procedure and usgs has been used this method since 1982 kim et al 2015 in this study the parameter b was estimated using direct method which is suggested by john as shown in fig 5 since the purpose of this study is to develop a rating curve between ground discharge that occurs in the tidal river basin and water level when it rains simulated discharge s q from the grm model and rainfall runoff component r h from water level decomposition were used 4 application to taehwa river basin 4 1 decomposition of water level in a tidal river the water level of ulsan station is greatly influenced by tides sea surface level is affected by the movement of the moon and sun which shows deterministic characteristics unlike the hydrologic data for precipitation and water levels the wave height is a stochastic component that causes uncertainty in the deterministic characteristics of the sea surface level the wavelet analysis using hourly data resulted in 10 15 hours as periodic components were meaningfully extracted for the short term while 14 17 days of periodic components were extracted from daily data as mid term components see fig 6 the short term and mid term components of the tide data are greatly affected by the moon s gravity force however the 1 year long term component shows a characteristic where the sea surface level becomes higher in the summer and lower in the winter due to the influence of the earth s revolution around the sun the long term component can be extracted through the wavelet analysis however there are some limitations in using the analysis for separating the component of a 1 year period since 8 years data were used only therefore the curve fitting function was used to extract the long term component with the sum of the sine functions 9 l o n g p e r i o d c o m p o n e n t 12 56 sin 0 00004 t 0 161 11 43 sin 0 00004 t 3 233 0 175 sin 0 5059 t 1 004 0 0189 sin 0 00002 t 0 826 0 122 sin 0 0007 t 2 366 0 082 s i n 0 524 t 2 861 since tidal data are deterministic long period component was simulated by using the six periodic components in form of sine functions in fact tide is predicted with high accuracy using harmonic analysis which is obtained as the sum of 64 periodic functions park 2018 in this study 6 components corresponding to the long term components of the 64 components were used to simulate the former see eq 9 the correlation coefficient between the long period component and the observed sea surface level is 0 89 which indicates that the long period component simulates the pattern of the observed tide data well the tide component can be explained with the sum of the short term mid term and long term components while the difference between the tide component and the observed sea surface level data can be explained by the wave height component the components for rainfall runoff and noise remain after tide and wave height components are subtracted from the water level series of the ulsan gauge station a high pass filter function was used to separate the non periodic component rainfall runoff that occurs with rainfall events and the noise component finally the water level series of the ulsan gauge station was divided into 4 components tide wave height noise and rainfall runoff components as shown in fig 7 the zoom graph in fig 7 shows the time series of total water level and tide component during typhoon chaba the event caused heavy rainfall over 300 mm and strong winds over 35 m s the tide component showing deterministic characteristics was observed to be higher than the high tide because the wave height increased influenced by typhoon invasion 4 2 estimation of discharge with the grm model 4 2 1 hydrological parameters grm was used to estimate the discharge that occurs with a rainfall event jodong station guyeong station and ulsan water level station are located in taehwa river basin the grm was reconstructed for each water level station as an outlet point of the sub basin and the model was simulated by estimating the discharge of each station see fig 8 the grm makes it possible to set parameters for each sub basins it is a distributed rainfall runoff model based on grids so it requires layers in the form of raster as the input data the topography data in the taehwa river basin were built using a 30 m 30 m dem data land cover and soil map with the same resolution as the dem were applied to construct for grm simulation see fig 9 4 2 2 radar rainfall and runoff simulation the event of typhoon chaba on october 6 2016 which caused huge damage in the taehwa river basin was selected as a calibration event and the localized heavy rainfall event on october 6 2018 was used as a validation event for grm model s simulation the terrain grid and radar rainfall grid should have the same resolution therefore the radar rainfall was resampled to 30 m 30 m since the resolution of the original radar rainfall data are 150 m 150 m to confirm the accuracy of radar rainfall estimation rainfall comparison with two rainfall gauge stations located in the taehwa river basin was performed as shown in fig 10 the results showed that the radar rainfall and ground rainfall exhibit almost the same values in the calibration event and the radar rainfall is underestimated than the ground rainfall in the validation event however when compared with rainfall intensity radar rainfall and ground rainfall exhibit similar values so runoff analysis was performed using radar data that can reflect spatial characteristics figs 11 and 12 show the rainfall s movement for the calibration event the rainfall moves in a north easterly direction which is the same traveling path of the typhoon for the validation event the summer monsoonal front makes the rainfall move to the south east both events show the same features of rainfall traveling from upstream to downstream leading to a higher discharge at the water level stations located in the downstream the runoff analysis was performed by using the radar data as the input rainfall for the grm since the grm model is a distributed model calibration of the model can be performed for each grid for example the soil permeability coefficient has different values for each grid depending on the soil map so the grm model can correct this for each grid by applying a calibration coefficient in this study the model was calibrated by trial and error method using calibration coefficient such as land cover roughness coefficient soil depth soil porosity soil wetting front and soil hydraulic conductivity figs 13 and 14 and table 1 show the results of the runoff analysis for calibration event and validation event the performance of the grm model was statistically evaluated using root mean square error rmse see eq 10 nash sutcliffe coefficients nsc eq 11 and mean absolute error mae eq 12 as shown in table 2 the grm model was calibrated to simulate the peak discharge well and the peak discharge error is shown in table 1 10 r m s e 1 n i 1 n q o i q s i 2 11 n s c 1 i 1 n q o i q s i 2 i 1 n q o i q o 2 12 m a e 1 n i 1 n q o i q s i in these equations q o i q s i are the observed and simulated discharge m 3 s at the i t h time q o is the average observed discharge m 3 s and n is the duration of each event the discharge of jodong station and guyeong station were simulated well showing a peak discharge difference of less than 30 m 3 s an 8 error compared with peak discharge however the discharge of ulsan station was underestimated about 500 m 3 s an 15 error compared with peak discharge which is affected by the tide as shown in table 1 mae of jodong and guyoung stations has a low error of less than 70 m 3 s but ulsan station shows a high error of 100 m 3 s or more in both calibration and validation events also in the case of rmse which imposes a high penalty where a large error occurs ulsan station shows a higher error about 100 m 3 s or more than other stations in general river like jodong and guyeong stations the simulated discharge equals the observed discharge since two stations is no more influenced by tide in contrast ulsan station is influenced by tide which shows the limitations in estimating the discharge and water level in a tidal river the nash sutcliffe coefficients of the grm model simulated at three stations are more than 0 8 confirming that the model is well constructed the reason for the significant difference between the simulated discharge and observed discharge from ulsan station is that the observed discharge is based on doppler method and converted from the flow velocity thus it is affected by many hydrological factors including discharge so the observed discharge can be higher than the simulation result of the grm ulsan station is located in the tidal river therefore the flow velocity and the discharge changes with the tide level since the amount of the observed discharge is found to be huge there is a need to establish the relationship between the simulated discharge by the grm and the rainfall runoff component the converted water level is added to the other three components to estimate the water level of the tidal river 4 3 development of stage discharge relation curve of tidal river a stage discharge curve is developed by using the rainfall runoff component obtained by the water level time series in ulsan station and the discharge simulated by the grm see fig 5 for the procedure the middle point q 3 of the curve is calculated as shown in fig 5 the value of b is estimated by obtaining h 3 corresponding to q 3 as shown in eqs 13 and 14 13 q 3 q 1 q 2 38 42 1814 09 264 002 m 3 s 14 b h 1 h 2 h 3 2 h 1 h 2 2 h 3 0 096 4 218 0 452 2 0 096 4 218 2 0 452 0 05904 the water level discharge relationship was developed using typhoon chaba as a calibration event the calculated b was added to the water level to draw a graph that shows the relation with the discharge fig 15 the stage discharge relation curve was obtained for the ulsan station as shown in eq 15 in this equation q is the discharge m 3 s simulated by the grm and r h is the separated rainfall runoff component for the ulsan water level station to verify the obtained curve we used the simulated discharge data to fig 15 and obtained r h before adding it to the other components tide wave height and noise for comparison with the observed water level the results of combined components and observed water level are figs 16 and 17 and table 2 in the calibration event the simulated water level was higher than the observed level by 0 27 m an 3 6 error compared with peak level as shown in fig 16 the simulation of the observed water level showed a great performance the accuracy of the calculated rating curve was reviewed using a localized heavy rainfall event as a validation event and the results presented almost the same as the observed water level fig 17 both of the events had about 10 normalized root mean square error nrmse a root mean square error rmse of about 0 18 m and nash sutcliffe coefficients nsc of 0 97 these results indicate a high accuracy of the simulation table 2 also the low water level is well simulated through tide and wave height components when the water level rises with the occurrence of rainfall the result shows that the simulated water level has a similar value to the observed water level 5 discussion the aim of proposed methodology is to estimate how much the discharge influenced by rainfall affects the increase in the water level in tidal river rating curve are mainly developed in general river where there is a linear relationship between rainfall and discharge clarke 1999 dottori et al 2009 gopalan et al 2020 for general rivers a rating curve can be used to predict the water level for forecasting as shown in fig 18 but this is not the case for a tidal river since its characteristics are non linear if the relation between discharge and water level cannot be defined it is hard to identify the extent on how much the water level rises from the runoff as shown in fig 18 as known the water level in tidal river rises not only due to the influence of tide but also due to the influence of wind caused by typhoons lewis et al 2019 investigated the role of tidal dynamics in the nearshore wave climate and found that the risk of flooding is greater because tidal dynamics alter the wave climate propagating into the coast therefore to understand how the discharge by rainfall affects the water level the rating curve is developed using separated rainfall runoff components and grm discharge as a result the tide component mainly affects the water level at low water levels it was also found that the rainfall runoff component plays a major role in raising the water level the prediction accuracy of the tide component is high because it has deterministic characteristics however it is hard to define the relationship between the discharge and the water level in the tidal river as shown in fig 19 the risk of flood damage in coastal areas is increasing due to rising sea levels storm surges and heavy rainfall due to climate change buchanan et al 2016 despite the increasing hydrological hazards such as tide and storm surge risk management in coastal areas is performed only through real time monitoring if the methodology presented in this study is used the water level of the tidal river can be predicted using forecasting data such as tide wave height and rainfall the results of this study can be used as a basic data for disaster management in coastal areas this study attempted to estimate the discharge by rainfall in the tidal river and convert the discharge to water level however the effect of the actual tide and wave height in the tidal river is underestimated because the distance between water level station and estuary is far in other words the lag time according to the distance and the swelling effect by high wind speed are not considered since the water level station is located far from the estuary to solve the first problem scale adjustment is performed using the average and standard deviation of the tide and wave height data located in the estuary and the average and standard deviation of the decomposed tide and wave height components on the other hand the latter was solved by means of using the water level station located in an inland zone rather than a coastal area so it is not significantly affected by wind speed the purpose of this study is to understand how much discharge by rainfall affects the water level rather than the effect of tide and wave height when compared with the previous study jo et al 2000 which developed a rating curve without decomposition of water level the results of this study improved r 2 0 3 and the standard error 0 2 m in future studies better results will be derived if the water level observatory located near the estuary will be used to quantify the effects of tide and wave height another limitation of this study is that the researchers did not consider the change of the bed level profile and the roughness coefficient the bed level profile and roughness coefficients are changing during the rainy and dry season but in this study the rainy season was selected as the target event therefore the same values were used in the future this study could be improved by analyzing different water levels based on bed level profile and roughness coefficient both during rainy and dry season if the rating curve suggested in this study is used the discharge caused by rainfall can be converted into water level and the water level of the tidal river can be predicted 6 conclusion this study presents a novel method of a rating curve for the accurate estimation of water levels in tidal river which are influenced by a number of hydrological factors this is the first study to develop a rating curve by separating the water level into four components tide wave rainfall runoff noise and simulating the discharge generated by rainfall a wavelet analysis curve fitting function and high pass filter were used to divide the water levels into different components the development of a stage discharge curve required the estimation of runoff caused by a rainfall event therefore a discharge was simulated by the grm after constructing sub basins with water level gauging stations as outlets as a result jodong and guyeong stations which are not influenced by tide showed good performance in simulating the observed discharge however ulsan station which is affected by the tide have an underestimated discharge to solve this problem a separated rainfall runoff component and the simulated discharge by the grm were used to develop a stage discharge curve the discharge simulated by the grm was converted into the water level by using the curve and then added to the other components tide wave height and noise components to estimate the tidal river level for the two events the water level simulation showed greater performance with less than 10 error the stage discharge curve in a tidal river could significantly contribute to understanding the non linear properties the results could be used for predicting water levels from discharge in consideration of other components to efficiently manage tidal rivers water levels during flooding seasons there are several limitations in this study discharge affected by rainfall could be simulated through grm suggested in this study however discharge due to tidal effects cannot be estimated in order to solve this problem a future study will analyze the relationship between the water level and discharge considering the cross section of the river during no rainfall in order to estimate the discharge due to tide in addition since sea level rise caused by climate change makes the effects of tide and wave heights greater it is necessary to advance the rating curve of tidal rivers considering the climate change in future studies if future study to predict the water level of the tidal river using the sea level data at estuary and the runoff data at the upstream is conducted the water level of the tidal stream can be predicted with

the classical g e v to use the g e v and non extreme value distributions such as the b r x i i to describe precipitation extremes keywords extreme rainfall analysis over italy generalized extreme value distribution burr type xii distribution chirps v2 0 dataset 1 introduction designing flood protection and hydraulic infrastructure requires the use of high return periods or low probability levels associated with extreme rainfall values describing the statistical behavior of extreme events is crucial to limit the risk of failure of civil engineering works and consequently to limit the loss of human lives deterministic long term predictions of rainfall are not feasible thus using probabilistic methods is a necessity papalexiou et al 2013 however finding a suitable probability distribution to describe rainfall extremes can be challenging choosing a wrong distribution or misfitting it may lead to estimation errors of rainfall quantiles and consequently underestimate or even overestimate flood risk according to the extreme value theory evt the largest values extracted from a set of independent identically distributed random variables tends to an asymptotic distribution that depends on the tail of the distribution of the parent variable fisher and tippett 1928 gnedenko 1943 gumbel 1958 evi gumbel evii fr√©chet and eviii reversed weibull are the three possible asymptotic laws that can be unified into the single expression known as the generalized extreme value g e v distribution von mises 1936 the g e v is widely used worldwide even though some authors showed a certain skepticism to use it for modelling daily rainfall de michele and avanzi 2018 zorzetto et al 2016 coles et al 2003 suggested the use of the g e v model over the gumbel distribution for accounting of the uncertainty in the analysis of daily rainfall in maiqueta venezuela lee and maeng 2003 selected the g e v as the appropriate probability distribution to describe 38 annual maximum daily rainfall samples in korea chu et al 2009 suggested the use of the gumbel distribution to describe annual maximum daily rainfall series since by fitting the g e v to 158 hawaiian samples the shape parameter resulted close to zero smith et al 2011 fitted the g e v distribution to annual maximum daily rainfall series recorded in the central section of the eastern united states showing a positive shape parameter and thus heavy tails for extreme rainfall villarini 2012 analyzed annual and seasonal rainfall samples recorded by 44 rain gauges located in east europe ukraine moldova and romania using the g e v distribution to examine the upper tail properties at both time scales the author shows that the fr√©chet distribution performed better than the other two distributions highlighting a heavy tail behavior in a global analysis of 15 137 records papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2013 investigated which of the three limiting types of the g e v best describes the annual daily maxima rainfall the study revealed that the fr√©chet distribution performs best while bounded from above distributions e g the reverse weibull emerge as artifact from sample variation and are justified yang et al 2013 found a correlation between extreme rainfall and elevation in northern china by fitting the g e v to seasonal extreme rainfall samples nguyen and nguyen 2016 considered the g e v as the most suitable model to describe annual maximum rainfall series for 21 stations located in ontario canada the previous studies use rain gauge records however many regions around the globe remain ungauged or have a sparce gauge network bertini et al 2020 mishra and coulibaly 2009 also in some countries retrieving such data may be difficult due to strict regulations and bureaucracy for example the italian peninsula has a dense rain gauge network comprising 5265 station over 301 000 km2 yet an open dataset is not available libertino et al 2018 mazzoglio et al 2020 over the last decades to overcome the limited data availability the use of satellite precipitation datasets offering global coverage high resolution and accessibility has become popular rajulapati et al 2020 sun et al 2018 in this paper we analyze extreme daily rainfall in italy using a satellite based fine resolution gridded product that is the climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station chirps dataset funk et al 2015b a this dataset has been already tested and evaluated in italy duan et al 2016 and in many other countries such as argentina rivera et al 2018 brazil paredes trejo et al 2017 china bai et al 2018 tang et al 2020 india prakash 2019 and cyprus katsanos et al 2016 such studies corroborate the reliability of the chirps dataset to reproduce different characteristics of precipitation depending on the applied region for instance duan et al 2016 compared daily data recorded by 101 rain gauges in italy with eight gridded products in the adige basin north east despite inconsistencies found in all the eight products in the frequency of occurrence of daily precipitation especially in the winter months chirps trmm 3b42 huffman et al 2006 and cmorph bld xie and xiong 2011 provided the best performances in terms of overall statistics metrics also caroletti et al 2019 compared gridded data with ground data for the calabria region south west of italy using monthly rainfall data collected by rain gauges their findings confirm that the satellite based chirps product provides the best performances in terms of pearson correlation error metrics and extreme events here we use the chirps product to investigate the spatial variation of the g e v distribution and its performance in describing annual maxima over italy we compare its performance with a non extreme value distribution that is the burr type xii b r x i i burr 1942 to show that the g e v distribution should not be used blindly specifically we investigate the exceedance probability related to the upper limit predicted by the g e v distribution when it converges to the reverse weibull using a distribution bounded from above stands contradicts the nature of many hydrological variables and might lead to severe risk underestimation instead we propose fitting the g e v distribution excluding the reverse weibull case the fitting results show that the shape parameter of the g e v distribution forms coherent spatial patterns we use these results to build rainfall depth maps for different return periods that could be useful both for research and engineering practice 2 the data 2 1 study area italy is in southern europe between latitudes 35 475 n and 47 125 n and longitudes 6 625 e and 18 525 e the mediterranean peninsula is characterized by a complex orography that affects the climate fig 1 italy s climate based on the k√∂ppen geiger kg classification beck et al 2018 kottek et al 2006 peel et al 2007 is mainly temperate c and cold d or polar e at higher altitudes the climate of west coast and of the two major islands sicily and sardinia is the so called mediterranean csa kg while parts of the inland have dry and warm summers and rainy winters csb kg most of the adriatic coast the po valley and parts of the central apennines have humid sub littoral climate cfa kg with no dry season which is characterized by two peaks of rainfall fall and spring hot summers and moderately cold winters the sub continental climate cfb kg characterizes the apennine and the foothills of the alps with wet and warm summers at higher altitudes the climate is boreal with no dry season and warm dfb kg and cold dfc kg summers very cold winters and snow between november and march along the alps there is also the tundra climate et kg with low temperatures below 10 c all the year the various climates of italy indicate diverse monthly and annual precipitation but do not characterize differences in extremes it is rational however to assume that such climatic conditions can affect the behavior of extremes here we focus on the evaluation of extreme precipitation in italy which often occurs as thunderstorms for example telesca et al 2008 identify three thunderstorm types in italy large fronts generally coming from the north west local convective cells typical of the summer season and orographic thunderstorms however to classify the thunderstorms is out of the scope of this study and needs fine temporal resolution data e g hourly here we focus on the extremes at the daily scale 2 2 dataset the climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station data chirps is a quasi global 50 s 50 n and all longitudes precipitation dataset funk et al 2015b a chirps provides fine spatial resolution daily rainfall at 0 05 approximately 5 km in the 1981 present period it calibrates infrared cold cloud duration observations with the tropical rainfall measuring mission multi satellite precipitation analysis version 7 tmpa 3b42 v7 and then incorporates ground data literature studies show that chirps provides a fine resolution precipitation measurements and is reliable for italy caroletti et al 2019 duan et al 2016 at the 5 km spatial resolution there are 13 247 grid cells covering italy and thus we extracted and analyzed 13 247 time series in the period 1981 2019 2 3 main statistics of the chirps product the marginal distribution of daily rainfall is mixed having thus a discrete and a continuous part describing respectively the probability dry and the non zero values in wet days papalexiou 2018 for each of the 13 247 grid cells we calculate the probability dry ratio of dry to total days the mean value the standard deviation sd and the three l ratios l variation l skewness and l kurtosis hosking 1990 the mean daily value and the standard deviation represent respectively measures of central tendency and dispersion while the three l ratios are dimensionless and represent measures of distributional shape the west coastal areas and the two major islands are dry with a probability dry ranging from 0 83 up to 0 89 while the greatest values of the mean daily rainfall that is greater than the 75th percentile of 14 3 mm are spread at higher altitude with some spots on the west coast fig 2 a high amount of daily precipitation in dry areas could be due to unstable weather conditions especially during the summer which cause several convective storms davini et al 2012 telesca et al 2008 the east coast the po valley and some parts of trentino piedmont sicily and of the east coast of sardinia register the lowest values of the mean rainfall smaller than the 25th percentile of about 11 7 mm per day the standard deviation presents the same spatial patterns observed for the mean rainfall with a pearson correlation coefficient of 0 93 the l variation which is a standardized measure of variance given by the ratio of the l scale and the central tendency shows high values greater than the median of 0 416 in all the alpine and sub alpine zones and in the south especially in sicily and in the south of apulia same patterns are observed for the l skewness and l kurtosis with high values greater than the median observed also in tuscany and lazio to summarize and assess the statistical behavior of extreme precipitation we evaluate those statistics also for daily annual maxima samples am extracted from each 13 247 grid cells fig 3 the mean daily rainfall exhibits the lowest values less than the median of about 53 7 mm on the east coast and in the two major islands and in some spots of piedmont trentino alto adige and central italy the resulting standard deviation shows the minimum values less than the median of about 14 7 mm in the south east areas and in some parts of lombardia lazio tuscany and north of sardinia essentially at lower values of mean daily precipitation are associated low values of the standard deviation the spatial variability of the three l ratios provides a first view of the statistical behavior of the extreme events because both the magnitude and the frequency of these events are controlled by the shape characteristics of precipitation distribution papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2016 the variability of the l variation presents the lower values less than the 25th percentile of about 0 13 in the centre of italy and in lombardia while the heavier values are spread in piedmont in south apulia and in south sardinia l skewness shows a wide variability indeed we notice both negative and positive values the variability of these main statistics evaluated on the annual maxima samples all over italy may imply the presence of spatial patterns of precipitation extremes 3 methodology 3 1 extreme value theory and generalized extreme value distribution the g e v distribution firstly introduced by von mises 1936 is widely adopted to study extreme events its cumulative distribution function cdf is given by 1 f g e v x Œ± Œ≤ Œ≥ e x p 1 Œ≥ x Œ± Œ≤ 1 Œ≥ 1 Œ≥ x Œ± Œ≤ 0 where Œ± r Œ≤ 0 and Œ≥ r are respectively location scale and shape parameters depending on the value of the shape parameter the g e v distribution encompasses the three limiting distributions of the extreme value theory evt the type i or gumbel g the type ii or fr√©chet f and the type iii or reverse weibull r w their cdfs are given by 2 f g x Œ± Œ≤ exp exp x Œ± Œ≤ x r 3 f f x Œ± Œ≤ Œ≥ exp x Œ± Œ≤ 1 Œ≥ x Œ± 4 f r w x Œ± Œ≤ Œ≥ e x p x Œ± Œ≤ 1 Œ≥ x Œ± the three distributions have a location parameter Œ± r and a scale parameter Œ≤ 0 and the fr√©chet and the reverse weibull have also a shape parameter Œ≥ 0 the gumbel distribution is defined for x r fr√©chet distribution is bounded from below and reverse weibull is bounded from above these three distributions are special cases of the g e v depending on the values of its shape parameter Œ≥ that is for Œ≥ tending to zero positive and negative the gumbel fr√©chet and reverse weibull laws emerge respectively note that the previous extreme value laws are limiting laws emerging under specific assumptions particularly given a set of independent and identically distributed random variables x 1 x n described by the distribution f x x the distribution of the maximum max x 1 x n is given by f x m a x x f x x n the three ev laws emerge for n however the convergence to one of these three asymptotic distributions should not be taken for granted because the length n of observed samples is typically small papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2013 the type of tail of f x x parent distribution dictates to which one of the three limiting laws the distribution of the maximum converges the right tail represents the upper part of a probability distribution and governs the behavior of extreme events moccia et al 2021 nerantzaki and papalexiou 2019 many tail classifications exist el adlouni et al 2008 ouarda et al 1994 werner and upper 2002 in general power type tails converge to the fr√©chet law exponential ones to the gumbel and bounded from above tails to the reversed weibull thus the fr√©chet is a power type distribution and all distributions with right tail regularly varying in infinity i e power type distributions belong to its domain of attraction in contrast the gumbel distribution has exponential right tail that approaches to zero more rapidly than any power type distribution although g e v is widely used to describe extreme precipitation it has limitations sample variations can lead to negative shape parameter estimates resulting in an upper bound distribution an upper bounded distribution such as the r w assumes a maximum precipitation value which cannot be exceeded while it is well documented that even probable maximum precipitation pmp estimates have been surpassed salas et al 2020 precipitation is a natural process limited at zero but an upper bound cannot be justified since there is always a probability to rain more recently several non extreme value distributions were used in stochastic modelling to preserve the behaviour of extremes in hydroclimatic variables papalexiou 2018 papalexiou and serinaldi 2020 in this study we propose the employment of the burr type xii b r x i i distribution from the burr system burr 1942 in the formulation of papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2012 with cdf given by 5 f b r x i i x Œ≤ Œ≥ 1 Œ≥ 2 1 1 Œ≥ 2 x Œ≤ Œ≥ 1 1 Œ≥ 1 Œ≥ 2 where Œ≤ 0 is a scale parameter and Œ≥ 1 0 and Œ≥ 2 0 are shape parameters controlling the left and right tails respectively equivalently to the g e v for Œ≥ 0 the asymptotic behavior of b r x i i is x 1 Œ≥ 2 therefore it has the potential to model heavy tails the b r x i i includes as special cases the pareto type ii for Œ≥ 1 1 the weibull for Œ≥ 2 0 and the exponential distribution for Œ≥ 1 1 and Œ≥ 2 0 we explore the potential of this distribution to describe annual maxima of daily rainfall 3 2 l moments fitting to estimate the g e v and b r x i i parameters we use the method of l moments greenwood et al 1979 hosking 1990 hosking et al 1985 showed that l moments estimators especially for the g e v distribution have small bias and a lower root mean square error than the maximum likelihood method moreover vogel and fennessey 1993 documented the advantages of l moments over the conventional product moments note that l moments since they are defined as linear combination of order statistics have finite values for all heavy tailed power type distributions with asymptotic behaviour x 1 Œ≥ and Œ≥ 1 this is in contrast to product moments where the p th moment exists if Œ≥ p in practice this is crucial as the parameters of a three parameter power type distribution cannot be estimated for tails heavier than x 1 3 while it can be easily done with l moments therefore the use of l moments is highly suggested in estimating parameters of heavy tailed distributions here we fit both distributions to each of the 13 247 annual maxima am samples using l moments the spatial variability of the empirical estimates of the first l moment Œª ÀÜ 1 l variation œÑ ÀÜ 2 and l skewness œÑ ÀÜ 3 are reported in fig 3 the g e v can be easily fitted by using the first three sample l moments that are Œª ÀÜ 1 Œª ÀÜ 2 Œª ÀÜ 3 or l variation œÑ ÀÜ 2 Œª ÀÜ 2 Œª ÀÜ 1 and l skewness œÑ ÀÜ 3 Œª ÀÜ 3 Œª ÀÜ 2 hosking 1990 specifically the shape parameter can be numerically estimated by œÑ ÀÜ 3 3 2 1 3 Œ≥ 1 2 Œ≥ and the scale and the location parameters by Œ± Œª ÀÜ 1 Œª ÀÜ 2 Œ≥ 1 Œ≥ 1 2 Œ≥ 1 Œ≥ 1 Œ≥ and Œ≤ Œª ÀÜ 2 2 Œ≥ 1 Œ≥ Œ≥ where Œ≥ is the gamma function the b r x i i distribution can also be fitted with l moments method here we follow the approach of papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2012 2016 which was later generalized in zaghloul et al 2020b allowing to fit any distribution with two shape parameters defined for positive values this method relies in estimating the two shape parameters by numerically minimizing the squared difference between theoretical œÑ i and empirical œÑ ÀÜ i l ratios based on the following expressions 6 œÑ 2 Œ≥ 1 Œ≥ 2 Œª 2 Œª 1 0 1 q u 1 Œ≥ 1 Œ≥ 2 2 u 1 d u 0 1 q u 1 Œ≥ 1 Œ≥ 2 d u 7 œÑ 3 Œ≥ 1 Œ≥ 2 Œª 3 Œª 2 0 1 q u 1 Œ≥ 1 Œ≥ 2 6 u 2 6 u 1 d u 0 1 q u 1 Œ≥ 1 Œ≥ 2 2 u 1 d u where q u 1 Œ≥ 1 Œ≥ 2 is the quantile function of the b r x i i with a scale parameter Œ≤ 1 then the two shape parameters can be estimated with 8 Œ≥ ÀÜ 1 Œ≥ ÀÜ 2 a r g min Œ≥ 1 Œ≥ 2 i 2 3 œÑ i Œ≥ 1 Œ≥ 2 œÑ ÀÜ i 2 given the shape parameters the scale parameter is estimated by 9 Œ≤ ÀÜ a r g min Œ≤ Œª 1 Œ≤ Œª ÀÜ 1 2 with Œª 1 Œ≤ 0 1 q u Œ≤ Œ≥ ÀÜ 1 Œ≥ ÀÜ 2 d u to test if the b r x i i is a good candidate to describe the am samples over italy we use l moments ratio diagrams papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2016 vogel and fennessey 1993 by comparing the sample l points œÑ ÀÜ 2 œÑ ÀÜ 3 with the b r x i i theoretical l moments space we assess if the tested distribution described well the observations results show that almost all empirical l points lie inside the theoretical l space fig 4 hence b r x i i is a competent model to describe the data in the supplementary material we also depict the observed l points and the theoretical g e v line in the l skewness and l kurtosis space figure s1 note that since the g e v has a location parameter it cannot be represented in an l skewness vs l variation space l variation is a function of all of its parameters 3 3 quantifying the fitting error in order to perform a comparison between the fitted g e v and b r x i i distributions we use four different error measures papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2016 zaghloul et al 2020b 10 e r i 1 n i 1 n Œ¥ x i 11 e r i i 1 m i n m 1 n Œ¥ x i 12 e r i i i max Œ¥ x 1 Œ¥ x n 13 e r i v Œ¥ x n x ÀÜ n 100 where i is the rank of x i in the ordered sample x 1 x n and Œ¥ x i x i x ÀÜ i is the difference between the predicted and the observed values predicted values are estimated by using the quantile function of the fitted distribution with non exceedance probability i n 1 e r i is the absolute error e r i i quantifies the error in the highest m extreme values here m 10 e r i i i estimates the maximum error between the fitted and observed values and e r i v quantifies over or underestimation percentage of the maximum observed value by the fitted distribution 4 results and discussion 4 1 g e v fitting artifacts in the previous section we showed that the b r x i i can describe almost all the 13 247 samples of daily rainfall annual maxima recorded in italy since for Œ≥ 0 the g e v distribution presents the same right tail asymptotic behavior of the b r x i i we expect that our data would also lead to g e v distributions with a positive shape parameter to compare the two distributions in terms of tail heaviness we focus on the estimated values of the shape parameters i e Œ≥ for the g e v and Œ≥ 2 for the b r x i i for the g e v Œ≥ shows a wide variation ranging from 0 45 to 0 41 with a median value of 0 02 table 1 while Œ≥ 2 varies between 0 and 0 33 with a median value of 0 17 table 1 in general a remarkable difference emerges from the comparison of the tail behavior as quantified by the shape parameters fig 5 the b r x i i tails are typically heavier compared to the g e v tails with most of the points arranged under the Œ≥ g e v Œ≥ 2 line see dashed line in fig 5 for Œ≥ 2 0 2 the two distributions present a similar asymptotic behavior thus the points scatter in correspondence of the Œ≥ g e v Œ≥ 2 line the fitting reveals that 44 9 of the samples result in Œ≥ 0 for the g e v corresponding thus to a bounded from above distribution we deem that the use of a distribution with an upper bound to describe extreme precipitation is physically inconsistent and the good performance of the b r x i i distribution strengthens this argument the b r x i i is a power type distribution with the same tail asymptotic behavior as the g e v and yet the tail heaviness estimates for the two distributions differ profoundly with almost half of the g e v tails being bounded from above we deem that this is an artifact resulting by the mathematical formula of the g e v distribution and sample variations to highlight our statements we perform a monte carlo experiment generating 10 000 samples 40 values each from a g e v distribution with a positive shape parameter equal to 0 05 then fitting the g e v to those samples shows that almost 38 of them have a negative shape parameter with a mean value of 0 04 this result confirms that allowing g e v to take negative shape parameter is not justifiable as negative values emerge due to sampling variation the spatial variability of both the estimated shape parameters i e Œ≥ and Œ≥ 2 respectively for g e v and b r x i i for the 44 9 of grid cells with Œ≥ 0 is spread all over italy fig 6 for all these samples the g e v distribution implies an upper daily rainfall limit rl given by Œ± Œ≤ Œ≥ zaghloul et al 2020b we use the b r x i i distribution that is unbounded to estimate the return period related to these upper limits assumed by the g e v with the expression t r l 1 f b r x i i r l 1 results reveal that 8 of the am samples presents an rl with a return period less than 1000 years fig 7 b as these return periods are commonly used in engineering practice for example in spillway design choosing the g e v distribution might lead to risk underestimation we test the previous findings using daily ground data provided by noaa https www ncdc noaa gov cdo web datasets we select 13 italian stations with more than 40 years of observation locations are depicted in figure s2 of the supplementary material then we fit the g e v distribution to the extracted am samples using the l moments method summary statistics are provided in table s1 of the supplementary material for the selected stations only one returns a negative g e v shape parameter that is brindisi with 60 years of observation comparing between these results and those in table 1 we observe a slight reduction in the variability of the shape parameters between the two datasets also the mean value in ground stations 0 14 is slightly larger from the chirps mean 0 09 even though the two datasets are not directly comparable because point observation can have heavier tails which are smoothed out in gridded products due to areal averaging 25 km2 for the chirps data the results confirm the mathematical artifact affecting the g e v distribution 4 2 the g e v approach we argued that the reverse weibull is not a reasonable choice to describe the upper tails thus we suggest fitting the g e v distribution by constraining its shape parameter only to positive values this essentially implies using a gumbel distribution instead of a g e v with negative shape hereafter we denote this version of the g e v as g e v the gumbel distribution does not have a shape parameter and thus its l skewness is fixed and equal to œÑ 3 ln 9 8 ln 2 consequently if an am sample has œÑ ÀÜ 3 ln 9 8 ln 2 we fit the gumbel distribution eq 2 with scale and location parameters respectively given by Œ≤ Œª ÀÜ 2 ln 2 and Œ± Œª ÀÜ 1 Œ≥ Œ≤ where Œ≥ is the euler mascheroni constant otherwise we fit the g e v distribution clearly the g e v approach results in fitting the gumbel distribution for 44 9 of samples with Œ≥ 0 fig 6b and fitting the g e v to the rest 55 1 fig 8 although the median value of the shape parameter is moderate 0 084 see table 2 in some regions high values are spotted light colours in fig 8 denoting heavy tails many regions for example the north west area aosta valley and piedmont is characterized by high values of Œ≥ especially in the alpine area other clear patterns are observed in friuli venezia giulia in the po valley in tuscany in some parts of the apennine in apulia and basilicata in the north part of calabria and in south sardinia in table 2 we provide summary statistics of the estimated parameters for the g e v distribution we compare the potential of the b r x i i g e v and g e v to describe the observed annual maxima in terms of the four error measures eq s 10 13 fig 9 their performance is almost identical an important finding is that although are in general heavy tailed still they under estimate the observed rainfall maximum for the 74 78 5 and 69 3 of the analyzed samples fig 9d respectively such under estimation in the observed sample s maximum might imply a more severe underestimation for larger return periods the previous findings show that the b r x i i and g e v versions perform equally well but underestimate the observed largest value a reasonable assumption then could be that the distribution predicting higher values for larger return periods would underestimate less the actual future magnitudes to quantify the difference between the rainfall predictions we evaluate the percentage difference pd between the b r x i i and g e v estimates as 14 p d f b r x i i 1 1 1 t f g e v 1 1 1 t 1 100 and similarly for g e v by applying several return periods t commonly used for engineering purpose i e 50 100 200 500 and 1000 years our results show that the b r x i i predicts larger values compared to the other two distributions fig 10 indeed the median pd values are positive for all return periods the predicted rainfall values by the b r x i i for the 50 years return period are comparable with those of the g e v and g e v yet as return period increases up to 1000 years the pd becomes much larger with median higher than 15 notably a larger variance is observed in the pd values evaluated for the g e v compared to g e v which also increases with the return period this greater variance is explained because when g e v has Œ≥ 0 it predicts always lower rainfall values than b r x i i and thus the pd is positive in contrast it seems that in the g e v when essentially the gumbel is used to describe the negative shape parameter cases the b r x i i can predict less and this even creates negative pd values and the larger variance 4 3 rainfall maps for fixed return periods here we evaluate the spatial variation of the predicted precipitation for different return periods indeed the knowledge of rainfall patterns for particular return periods is a necessity for flood mapping and for designing hydraulic structures van de vyver 2012 based on the previous results we estimate the rainfall amount that on average is exceeded once every t years rainfall depths h are evaluated with the quantile functions of the three tested distributions that are b r x i i g e v and g e v differences in terms of rainfall values predicted by the three distributions for three representative return periods are shown in fig 11 for a clear representation of the differences previously discussed in fig 10 we grouped the rainfall values in six percentile classes see the legend in fig 11 that were evaluated for each return period as anticipated the three tested distributions exhibit in general the same spatial patterns fig 11 the highest rainfall values greater than the 95th percentile are in the alpine zone in liguria in the north of tuscany and in specific parts of calabria and apulia the same areas have been previously recognized as the ones with the highest values of mean daily rainfall fig 2b most of the adriatic coast is characterized by predicted values lower than the 25th percentile the extension of the apennine plays a crucial role for this behavior the occidental winds from the tyrrhenian sea are blocked by the mountain chain causing orographic rainfall the same behavior is found nearby the alps as the mountain chain blocks the winds from the north and protect the po valley in the south and in the two major islands we observe that the highest values of the rainfall depth are characteristics of the highest elevation the identified patterns remain roughly constant for smaller return periods yet careful inspection shows strong differences for the 1000 years period we further investigated the differences emerged in fig 11 by analysing the subdivision of the cells into the six percentile classes fig 12 at 50 years of return period the behavior is approximately the same for the three distributions consistently with the results obtained for e r i v fig 9d the higher variance already emerged in fig 10 for the g e v is reflected in a greater number of cells falling in the higher percentile classes by increasing the return period the potential large under estimation by the g e v distribution is found in many cells belonging to the first two percentile classes these results indicate that for many regions in italy the g e v distribution could potentially severely underestimate the magnitude of extremes for large return periods 4 4 relationship between rainfall depth and orography the spatial patterns emerged in the rainfall maps fig 11 seem to follow the orography of the country fig 1a to investigate this aspect we show in fig 13 a bivariate choropleth map to evaluate the correlation between the elevation above the sea level hereinafter q and the classes of rainfall depths to perform this comparison we choose the g e v to estimate the rainfall depths for several return periods i e 39 50 100 200 500 and 1000 years the highest values of elevation and rainfall depths whose grid cells are depicted with darkest purple blue colours are mostly located along the alps and the apennine particularly the alpine and pre alpine areas present heavier rainfall values with respect to the apennine chain at lower altitudes classes with q close to its median value a greater variability emerged in the distribution of rainfall with lower values light orange colours on the left of the legend along the apennine especially on the adriatic coast and higher values in the north purple values on the right of the legend the same variability can be observed over the flat areas mainly located along the coasts and in the po valley the lowest rainfall values are located on the adriatic and lazio coasts white cells blue and light blue cells are representative of greater values of precipitation over the plains see the po valley in fig 13 the relationship between the elevation and the rainfall depth does not change with the return period to highlight the above aspects we provide six different maps for each class of elevation in figure s3 of the supplementary material 5 summary and conclusions catastrophic events in italy such as floods and landslides have caused significant infrastructures damage an economic loss a robust estimation of rainfall depths for different return periods is crucial to plan and design hydraulic protection infrastructure to alleviate the impact of extremes the generalize extreme value g e v distribution is the most popular model to describe extreme rainfall worldwide yet it should be used with caution theoretical assumptions justifying the use of g e v are often violated in real world and thus we suggest using g e v with a priori restricting its shape parameter to positive values we name this variant the g e v we believe that using a distribution bounded from above such as the reverse weibull g e v with negative shape parameter is not consistent with natural processes limited at zero such as precipitation to support our statements we also used the burr type xii b r x i i distribution a non extreme value distribution defined in 0 to describe annual maxima and to compare it with g e v the b r x i i has the same asymptotic behavior with the g e v distribution which makes the comparison of the tail behavior valid the fitting performance and the spatial variability of the g e v are tested on 13 247 daily rainfall time series over italy using l moments our analysis reveals that 1 the g e v distribution in 44 9 of the samples had a negative shape parameter implying an upper daily rainfall limit fig 6 return periods related to these upper limits however are finite when estimated with the b r x i i distribution this indicates that upper bounds estimated by g e v might be artifacts caused by sample variations thus we suggest using the g e v only with positive shape parameters g e v 2 comparison of the right tail between the g e v and b r x i i distributions reveals notable differences although they have the same asymptotic behavior when Œ≥ 0 the b r x i i tails resulted heavier than the g e v tails especially when the shape parameter Œ≥ of g e v is lower than 0 2 nevertheless the spatial representation of g e v s positive shape parameter for the 55 1 of the samples allowed to identify many regions with heavy tails fig 8 3 the b r x i i g e v and g e v performed almost identically for the observed return period i e 39 years fig 9d although these models are heavy tailed they underestimate the observed rainfall maximum in 74 78 5 and 69 3 of the analysed samples respectively 4 the b r x i i for large return periods predicts larger rainfall amounts compared to the g e v estimates fig 10 this might indicate that g e v estimates could underestimate the risk of extremes 5 the rainfall spatial patterns emerged by fitting the three distributions are similar for the selected return periods the estimated rainfall depth tends to follow the orography of the territory with high rainfall at high altitude and moderate rainfall over the plains fig 13 this result confirmed the important role played by the high mountain chains on the rainfall distribution in italy these maps might be useful to update and integrate the estimated rainfall depths for fixed return periods evaluated with the rain gauge network based on the previous findings we suggest using the g e v instead of the classical g e v distribution but also include in the analysis non extreme value distributions such as the b r x i i to describe precipitation extremes it is impossible to verify which model predicts more accurately the extremes for large period however since the three models underestimate the observed sample maximum we could claim that the one underestimating it less might be a better choice authors statement benedetta moccia data curation formal analysis methodology visualization writing original draft writing review editing simon

8161,study region italy study focus knowing magnitude and frequency of extreme precipitation is necessary to reduce their impact on vulnerable areas here we investigate the performance of the generalized extreme value g e v distribution using a fine resolution satellite based gridded product to analyze 13 247 daily rainfall annual maxima samples a non extreme value distribution with a power type behavior that is the burr type xii b r x i i is also evaluated and used to test the reliability of the g e v in describing extreme rainfall new hydrological insights for the region 1 in 44 9 of the analyzed samples the g e v predicts an upper rainfall limit we deem this is an artifact due to sample variations 2 we suggest the g e v distribution that is the g e v with shape parameters restricted only to positive values as a more consistent model complying with the nature of extreme precipitation 3 g e v g e v and b r x i i performed equally well in describing the observed annual precipitation yet all distributions underestimate the observed sample maximum 4 the b r x i i for large return periods predicts larger rainfall amounts compared to g e v indicating that g e v estimates could underestimate the risk of extremes and 5 the correlation between the predicted rainfall and the elevation is investigated based on the results of this study we suggest instead of using the classical g e v to use the g e v and non extreme value distributions such as the b r x i i to describe precipitation extremes keywords extreme rainfall analysis over italy generalized extreme value distribution burr type xii distribution chirps v2 0 dataset 1 introduction designing flood protection and hydraulic infrastructure requires the use of high return periods or low probability levels associated with extreme rainfall values describing the statistical behavior of extreme events is crucial to limit the risk of failure of civil engineering works and consequently to limit the loss of human lives deterministic long term predictions of rainfall are not feasible thus using probabilistic methods is a necessity papalexiou et al 2013 however finding a suitable probability distribution to describe rainfall extremes can be challenging choosing a wrong distribution or misfitting it may lead to estimation errors of rainfall quantiles and consequently underestimate or even overestimate flood risk according to the extreme value theory evt the largest values extracted from a set of independent identically distributed random variables tends to an asymptotic distribution that depends on the tail of the distribution of the parent variable fisher and tippett 1928 gnedenko 1943 gumbel 1958 evi gumbel evii fr√©chet and eviii reversed weibull are the three possible asymptotic laws that can be unified into the single expression known as the generalized extreme value g e v distribution von mises 1936 the g e v is widely used worldwide even though some authors showed a certain skepticism to use it for modelling daily rainfall de michele and avanzi 2018 zorzetto et al 2016 coles et al 2003 suggested the use of the g e v model over the gumbel distribution for accounting of the uncertainty in the analysis of daily rainfall in maiqueta venezuela lee and maeng 2003 selected the g e v as the appropriate probability distribution to describe 38 annual maximum daily rainfall samples in korea chu et al 2009 suggested the use of the gumbel distribution to describe annual maximum daily rainfall series since by fitting the g e v to 158 hawaiian samples the shape parameter resulted close to zero smith et al 2011 fitted the g e v distribution to annual maximum daily rainfall series recorded in the central section of the eastern united states showing a positive shape parameter and thus heavy tails for extreme rainfall villarini 2012 analyzed annual and seasonal rainfall samples recorded by 44 rain gauges located in east europe ukraine moldova and romania using the g e v distribution to examine the upper tail properties at both time scales the author shows that the fr√©chet distribution performed better than the other two distributions highlighting a heavy tail behavior in a global analysis of 15 137 records papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2013 investigated which of the three limiting types of the g e v best describes the annual daily maxima rainfall the study revealed that the fr√©chet distribution performs best while bounded from above distributions e g the reverse weibull emerge as artifact from sample variation and are justified yang et al 2013 found a correlation between extreme rainfall and elevation in northern china by fitting the g e v to seasonal extreme rainfall samples nguyen and nguyen 2016 considered the g e v as the most suitable model to describe annual maximum rainfall series for 21 stations located in ontario canada the previous studies use rain gauge records however many regions around the globe remain ungauged or have a sparce gauge network bertini et al 2020 mishra and coulibaly 2009 also in some countries retrieving such data may be difficult due to strict regulations and bureaucracy for example the italian peninsula has a dense rain gauge network comprising 5265 station over 301 000 km2 yet an open dataset is not available libertino et al 2018 mazzoglio et al 2020 over the last decades to overcome the limited data availability the use of satellite precipitation datasets offering global coverage high resolution and accessibility has become popular rajulapati et al 2020 sun et al 2018 in this paper we analyze extreme daily rainfall in italy using a satellite based fine resolution gridded product that is the climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station chirps dataset funk et al 2015b a this dataset has been already tested and evaluated in italy duan et al 2016 and in many other countries such as argentina rivera et al 2018 brazil paredes trejo et al 2017 china bai et al 2018 tang et al 2020 india prakash 2019 and cyprus katsanos et al 2016 such studies corroborate the reliability of the chirps dataset to reproduce different characteristics of precipitation depending on the applied region for instance duan et al 2016 compared daily data recorded by 101 rain gauges in italy with eight gridded products in the adige basin north east despite inconsistencies found in all the eight products in the frequency of occurrence of daily precipitation especially in the winter months chirps trmm 3b42 huffman et al 2006 and cmorph bld xie and xiong 2011 provided the best performances in terms of overall statistics metrics also caroletti et al 2019 compared gridded data with ground data for the calabria region south west of italy using monthly rainfall data collected by rain gauges their findings confirm that the satellite based chirps product provides the best performances in terms of pearson correlation error metrics and extreme events here we use the chirps product to investigate the spatial variation of the g e v distribution and its performance in describing annual maxima over italy we compare its performance with a non extreme value distribution that is the burr type xii b r x i i burr 1942 to show that the g e v distribution should not be used blindly specifically we investigate the exceedance probability related to the upper limit predicted by the g e v distribution when it converges to the reverse weibull using a distribution bounded from above stands contradicts the nature of many hydrological variables and might lead to severe risk underestimation instead we propose fitting the g e v distribution excluding the reverse weibull case the fitting results show that the shape parameter of the g e v distribution forms coherent spatial patterns we use these results to build rainfall depth maps for different return periods that could be useful both for research and engineering practice 2 the data 2 1 study area italy is in southern europe between latitudes 35 475 n and 47 125 n and longitudes 6 625 e and 18 525 e the mediterranean peninsula is characterized by a complex orography that affects the climate fig 1 italy s climate based on the k√∂ppen geiger kg classification beck et al 2018 kottek et al 2006 peel et al 2007 is mainly temperate c and cold d or polar e at higher altitudes the climate of west coast and of the two major islands sicily and sardinia is the so called mediterranean csa kg while parts of the inland have dry and warm summers and rainy winters csb kg most of the adriatic coast the po valley and parts of the central apennines have humid sub littoral climate cfa kg with no dry season which is characterized by two peaks of rainfall fall and spring hot summers and moderately cold winters the sub continental climate cfb kg characterizes the apennine and the foothills of the alps with wet and warm summers at higher altitudes the climate is boreal with no dry season and warm dfb kg and cold dfc kg summers very cold winters and snow between november and march along the alps there is also the tundra climate et kg with low temperatures below 10 c all the year the various climates of italy indicate diverse monthly and annual precipitation but do not characterize differences in extremes it is rational however to assume that such climatic conditions can affect the behavior of extremes here we focus on the evaluation of extreme precipitation in italy which often occurs as thunderstorms for example telesca et al 2008 identify three thunderstorm types in italy large fronts generally coming from the north west local convective cells typical of the summer season and orographic thunderstorms however to classify the thunderstorms is out of the scope of this study and needs fine temporal resolution data e g hourly here we focus on the extremes at the daily scale 2 2 dataset the climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station data chirps is a quasi global 50 s 50 n and all longitudes precipitation dataset funk et al 2015b a chirps provides fine spatial resolution daily rainfall at 0 05 approximately 5 km in the 1981 present period it calibrates infrared cold cloud duration observations with the tropical rainfall measuring mission multi satellite precipitation analysis version 7 tmpa 3b42 v7 and then incorporates ground data literature studies show that chirps provides a fine resolution precipitation measurements and is reliable for italy caroletti et al 2019 duan et al 2016 at the 5 km spatial resolution there are 13 247 grid cells covering italy and thus we extracted and analyzed 13 247 time series in the period 1981 2019 2 3 main statistics of the chirps product the marginal distribution of daily rainfall is mixed having thus a discrete and a continuous part describing respectively the probability dry and the non zero values in wet days papalexiou 2018 for each of the 13 247 grid cells we calculate the probability dry ratio of dry to total days the mean value the standard deviation sd and the three l ratios l variation l skewness and l kurtosis hosking 1990 the mean daily value and the standard deviation represent respectively measures of central tendency and dispersion while the three l ratios are dimensionless and represent measures of distributional shape the west coastal areas and the two major islands are dry with a probability dry ranging from 0 83 up to 0 89 while the greatest values of the mean daily rainfall that is greater than the 75th percentile of 14 3 mm are spread at higher altitude with some spots on the west coast fig 2 a high amount of daily precipitation in dry areas could be due to unstable weather conditions especially during the summer which cause several convective storms davini et al 2012 telesca et al 2008 the east coast the po valley and some parts of trentino piedmont sicily and of the east coast of sardinia register the lowest values of the mean rainfall smaller than the 25th percentile of about 11 7 mm per day the standard deviation presents the same spatial patterns observed for the mean rainfall with a pearson correlation coefficient of 0 93 the l variation which is a standardized measure of variance given by the ratio of the l scale and the central tendency shows high values greater than the median of 0 416 in all the alpine and sub alpine zones and in the south especially in sicily and in the south of apulia same patterns are observed for the l skewness and l kurtosis with high values greater than the median observed also in tuscany and lazio to summarize and assess the statistical behavior of extreme precipitation we evaluate those statistics also for daily annual maxima samples am extracted from each 13 247 grid cells fig 3 the mean daily rainfall exhibits the lowest values less than the median of about 53 7 mm on the east coast and in the two major islands and in some spots of piedmont trentino alto adige and central italy the resulting standard deviation shows the minimum values less than the median of about 14 7 mm in the south east areas and in some parts of lombardia lazio tuscany and north of sardinia essentially at lower values of mean daily precipitation are associated low values of the standard deviation the spatial variability of the three l ratios provides a first view of the statistical behavior of the extreme events because both the magnitude and the frequency of these events are controlled by the shape characteristics of precipitation distribution papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2016 the variability of the l variation presents the lower values less than the 25th percentile of about 0 13 in the centre of italy and in lombardia while the heavier values are spread in piedmont in south apulia and in south sardinia l skewness shows a wide variability indeed we notice both negative and positive values the variability of these main statistics evaluated on the annual maxima samples all over italy may imply the presence of spatial patterns of precipitation extremes 3 methodology 3 1 extreme value theory and generalized extreme value distribution the g e v distribution firstly introduced by von mises 1936 is widely adopted to study extreme events its cumulative distribution function cdf is given by 1 f g e v x Œ± Œ≤ Œ≥ e x p 1 Œ≥ x Œ± Œ≤ 1 Œ≥ 1 Œ≥ x Œ± Œ≤ 0 where Œ± r Œ≤ 0 and Œ≥ r are respectively location scale and shape parameters depending on the value of the shape parameter the g e v distribution encompasses the three limiting distributions of the extreme value theory evt the type i or gumbel g the type ii or fr√©chet f and the type iii or reverse weibull r w their cdfs are given by 2 f g x Œ± Œ≤ exp exp x Œ± Œ≤ x r 3 f f x Œ± Œ≤ Œ≥ exp x Œ± Œ≤ 1 Œ≥ x Œ± 4 f r w x Œ± Œ≤ Œ≥ e x p x Œ± Œ≤ 1 Œ≥ x Œ± the three distributions have a location parameter Œ± r and a scale parameter Œ≤ 0 and the fr√©chet and the reverse weibull have also a shape parameter Œ≥ 0 the gumbel distribution is defined for x r fr√©chet distribution is bounded from below and reverse weibull is bounded from above these three distributions are special cases of the g e v depending on the values of its shape parameter Œ≥ that is for Œ≥ tending to zero positive and negative the gumbel fr√©chet and reverse weibull laws emerge respectively note that the previous extreme value laws are limiting laws emerging under specific assumptions particularly given a set of independent and identically distributed random variables x 1 x n described by the distribution f x x the distribution of the maximum max x 1 x n is given by f x m a x x f x x n the three ev laws emerge for n however the convergence to one of these three asymptotic distributions should not be taken for granted because the length n of observed samples is typically small papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2013 the type of tail of f x x parent distribution dictates to which one of the three limiting laws the distribution of the maximum converges the right tail represents the upper part of a probability distribution and governs the behavior of extreme events moccia et al 2021 nerantzaki and papalexiou 2019 many tail classifications exist el adlouni et al 2008 ouarda et al 1994 werner and upper 2002 in general power type tails converge to the fr√©chet law exponential ones to the gumbel and bounded from above tails to the reversed weibull thus the fr√©chet is a power type distribution and all distributions with right tail regularly varying in infinity i e power type distributions belong to its domain of attraction in contrast the gumbel distribution has exponential right tail that approaches to zero more rapidly than any power type distribution although g e v is widely used to describe extreme precipitation it has limitations sample variations can lead to negative shape parameter estimates resulting in an upper bound distribution an upper bounded distribution such as the r w assumes a maximum precipitation value which cannot be exceeded while it is well documented that even probable maximum precipitation pmp estimates have been surpassed salas et al 2020 precipitation is a natural process limited at zero but an upper bound cannot be justified since there is always a probability to rain more recently several non extreme value distributions were used in stochastic modelling to preserve the behaviour of extremes in hydroclimatic variables papalexiou 2018 papalexiou and serinaldi 2020 in this study we propose the employment of the burr type xii b r x i i distribution from the burr system burr 1942 in the formulation of papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2012 with cdf given by 5 f b r x i i x Œ≤ Œ≥ 1 Œ≥ 2 1 1 Œ≥ 2 x Œ≤ Œ≥ 1 1 Œ≥ 1 Œ≥ 2 where Œ≤ 0 is a scale parameter and Œ≥ 1 0 and Œ≥ 2 0 are shape parameters controlling the left and right tails respectively equivalently to the g e v for Œ≥ 0 the asymptotic behavior of b r x i i is x 1 Œ≥ 2 therefore it has the potential to model heavy tails the b r x i i includes as special cases the pareto type ii for Œ≥ 1 1 the weibull for Œ≥ 2 0 and the exponential distribution for Œ≥ 1 1 and Œ≥ 2 0 we explore the potential of this distribution to describe annual maxima of daily rainfall 3 2 l moments fitting to estimate the g e v and b r x i i parameters we use the method of l moments greenwood et al 1979 hosking 1990 hosking et al 1985 showed that l moments estimators especially for the g e v distribution have small bias and a lower root mean square error than the maximum likelihood method moreover vogel and fennessey 1993 documented the advantages of l moments over the conventional product moments note that l moments since they are defined as linear combination of order statistics have finite values for all heavy tailed power type distributions with asymptotic behaviour x 1 Œ≥ and Œ≥ 1 this is in contrast to product moments where the p th moment exists if Œ≥ p in practice this is crucial as the parameters of a three parameter power type distribution cannot be estimated for tails heavier than x 1 3 while it can be easily done with l moments therefore the use of l moments is highly suggested in estimating parameters of heavy tailed distributions here we fit both distributions to each of the 13 247 annual maxima am samples using l moments the spatial variability of the empirical estimates of the first l moment Œª ÀÜ 1 l variation œÑ ÀÜ 2 and l skewness œÑ ÀÜ 3 are reported in fig 3 the g e v can be easily fitted by using the first three sample l moments that are Œª ÀÜ 1 Œª ÀÜ 2 Œª ÀÜ 3 or l variation œÑ ÀÜ 2 Œª ÀÜ 2 Œª ÀÜ 1 and l skewness œÑ ÀÜ 3 Œª ÀÜ 3 Œª ÀÜ 2 hosking 1990 specifically the shape parameter can be numerically estimated by œÑ ÀÜ 3 3 2 1 3 Œ≥ 1 2 Œ≥ and the scale and the location parameters by Œ± Œª ÀÜ 1 Œª ÀÜ 2 Œ≥ 1 Œ≥ 1 2 Œ≥ 1 Œ≥ 1 Œ≥ and Œ≤ Œª ÀÜ 2 2 Œ≥ 1 Œ≥ Œ≥ where Œ≥ is the gamma function the b r x i i distribution can also be fitted with l moments method here we follow the approach of papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2012 2016 which was later generalized in zaghloul et al 2020b allowing to fit any distribution with two shape parameters defined for positive values this method relies in estimating the two shape parameters by numerically minimizing the squared difference between theoretical œÑ i and empirical œÑ ÀÜ i l ratios based on the following expressions 6 œÑ 2 Œ≥ 1 Œ≥ 2 Œª 2 Œª 1 0 1 q u 1 Œ≥ 1 Œ≥ 2 2 u 1 d u 0 1 q u 1 Œ≥ 1 Œ≥ 2 d u 7 œÑ 3 Œ≥ 1 Œ≥ 2 Œª 3 Œª 2 0 1 q u 1 Œ≥ 1 Œ≥ 2 6 u 2 6 u 1 d u 0 1 q u 1 Œ≥ 1 Œ≥ 2 2 u 1 d u where q u 1 Œ≥ 1 Œ≥ 2 is the quantile function of the b r x i i with a scale parameter Œ≤ 1 then the two shape parameters can be estimated with 8 Œ≥ ÀÜ 1 Œ≥ ÀÜ 2 a r g min Œ≥ 1 Œ≥ 2 i 2 3 œÑ i Œ≥ 1 Œ≥ 2 œÑ ÀÜ i 2 given the shape parameters the scale parameter is estimated by 9 Œ≤ ÀÜ a r g min Œ≤ Œª 1 Œ≤ Œª ÀÜ 1 2 with Œª 1 Œ≤ 0 1 q u Œ≤ Œ≥ ÀÜ 1 Œ≥ ÀÜ 2 d u to test if the b r x i i is a good candidate to describe the am samples over italy we use l moments ratio diagrams papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2016 vogel and fennessey 1993 by comparing the sample l points œÑ ÀÜ 2 œÑ ÀÜ 3 with the b r x i i theoretical l moments space we assess if the tested distribution described well the observations results show that almost all empirical l points lie inside the theoretical l space fig 4 hence b r x i i is a competent model to describe the data in the supplementary material we also depict the observed l points and the theoretical g e v line in the l skewness and l kurtosis space figure s1 note that since the g e v has a location parameter it cannot be represented in an l skewness vs l variation space l variation is a function of all of its parameters 3 3 quantifying the fitting error in order to perform a comparison between the fitted g e v and b r x i i distributions we use four different error measures papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2016 zaghloul et al 2020b 10 e r i 1 n i 1 n Œ¥ x i 11 e r i i 1 m i n m 1 n Œ¥ x i 12 e r i i i max Œ¥ x 1 Œ¥ x n 13 e r i v Œ¥ x n x ÀÜ n 100 where i is the rank of x i in the ordered sample x 1 x n and Œ¥ x i x i x ÀÜ i is the difference between the predicted and the observed values predicted values are estimated by using the quantile function of the fitted distribution with non exceedance probability i n 1 e r i is the absolute error e r i i quantifies the error in the highest m extreme values here m 10 e r i i i estimates the maximum error between the fitted and observed values and e r i v quantifies over or underestimation percentage of the maximum observed value by the fitted distribution 4 results and discussion 4 1 g e v fitting artifacts in the previous section we showed that the b r x i i can describe almost all the 13 247 samples of daily rainfall annual maxima recorded in italy since for Œ≥ 0 the g e v distribution presents the same right tail asymptotic behavior of the b r x i i we expect that our data would also lead to g e v distributions with a positive shape parameter to compare the two distributions in terms of tail heaviness we focus on the estimated values of the shape parameters i e Œ≥ for the g e v and Œ≥ 2 for the b r x i i for the g e v Œ≥ shows a wide variation ranging from 0 45 to 0 41 with a median value of 0 02 table 1 while Œ≥ 2 varies between 0 and 0 33 with a median value of 0 17 table 1 in general a remarkable difference emerges from the comparison of the tail behavior as quantified by the shape parameters fig 5 the b r x i i tails are typically heavier compared to the g e v tails with most of the points arranged under the Œ≥ g e v Œ≥ 2 line see dashed line in fig 5 for Œ≥ 2 0 2 the two distributions present a similar asymptotic behavior thus the points scatter in correspondence of the Œ≥ g e v Œ≥ 2 line the fitting reveals that 44 9 of the samples result in Œ≥ 0 for the g e v corresponding thus to a bounded from above distribution we deem that the use of a distribution with an upper bound to describe extreme precipitation is physically inconsistent and the good performance of the b r x i i distribution strengthens this argument the b r x i i is a power type distribution with the same tail asymptotic behavior as the g e v and yet the tail heaviness estimates for the two distributions differ profoundly with almost half of the g e v tails being bounded from above we deem that this is an artifact resulting by the mathematical formula of the g e v distribution and sample variations to highlight our statements we perform a monte carlo experiment generating 10 000 samples 40 values each from a g e v distribution with a positive shape parameter equal to 0 05 then fitting the g e v to those samples shows that almost 38 of them have a negative shape parameter with a mean value of 0 04 this result confirms that allowing g e v to take negative shape parameter is not justifiable as negative values emerge due to sampling variation the spatial variability of both the estimated shape parameters i e Œ≥ and Œ≥ 2 respectively for g e v and b r x i i for the 44 9 of grid cells with Œ≥ 0 is spread all over italy fig 6 for all these samples the g e v distribution implies an upper daily rainfall limit rl given by Œ± Œ≤ Œ≥ zaghloul et al 2020b we use the b r x i i distribution that is unbounded to estimate the return period related to these upper limits assumed by the g e v with the expression t r l 1 f b r x i i r l 1 results reveal that 8 of the am samples presents an rl with a return period less than 1000 years fig 7 b as these return periods are commonly used in engineering practice for example in spillway design choosing the g e v distribution might lead to risk underestimation we test the previous findings using daily ground data provided by noaa https www ncdc noaa gov cdo web datasets we select 13 italian stations with more than 40 years of observation locations are depicted in figure s2 of the supplementary material then we fit the g e v distribution to the extracted am samples using the l moments method summary statistics are provided in table s1 of the supplementary material for the selected stations only one returns a negative g e v shape parameter that is brindisi with 60 years of observation comparing between these results and those in table 1 we observe a slight reduction in the variability of the shape parameters between the two datasets also the mean value in ground stations 0 14 is slightly larger from the chirps mean 0 09 even though the two datasets are not directly comparable because point observation can have heavier tails which are smoothed out in gridded products due to areal averaging 25 km2 for the chirps data the results confirm the mathematical artifact affecting the g e v distribution 4 2 the g e v approach we argued that the reverse weibull is not a reasonable choice to describe the upper tails thus we suggest fitting the g e v distribution by constraining its shape parameter only to positive values this essentially implies using a gumbel distribution instead of a g e v with negative shape hereafter we denote this version of the g e v as g e v the gumbel distribution does not have a shape parameter and thus its l skewness is fixed and equal to œÑ 3 ln 9 8 ln 2 consequently if an am sample has œÑ ÀÜ 3 ln 9 8 ln 2 we fit the gumbel distribution eq 2 with scale and location parameters respectively given by Œ≤ Œª ÀÜ 2 ln 2 and Œ± Œª ÀÜ 1 Œ≥ Œ≤ where Œ≥ is the euler mascheroni constant otherwise we fit the g e v distribution clearly the g e v approach results in fitting the gumbel distribution for 44 9 of samples with Œ≥ 0 fig 6b and fitting the g e v to the rest 55 1 fig 8 although the median value of the shape parameter is moderate 0 084 see table 2 in some regions high values are spotted light colours in fig 8 denoting heavy tails many regions for example the north west area aosta valley and piedmont is characterized by high values of Œ≥ especially in the alpine area other clear patterns are observed in friuli venezia giulia in the po valley in tuscany in some parts of the apennine in apulia and basilicata in the north part of calabria and in south sardinia in table 2 we provide summary statistics of the estimated parameters for the g e v distribution we compare the potential of the b r x i i g e v and g e v to describe the observed annual maxima in terms of the four error measures eq s 10 13 fig 9 their performance is almost identical an important finding is that although are in general heavy tailed still they under estimate the observed rainfall maximum for the 74 78 5 and 69 3 of the analyzed samples fig 9d respectively such under estimation in the observed sample s maximum might imply a more severe underestimation for larger return periods the previous findings show that the b r x i i and g e v versions perform equally well but underestimate the observed largest value a reasonable assumption then could be that the distribution predicting higher values for larger return periods would underestimate less the actual future magnitudes to quantify the difference between the rainfall predictions we evaluate the percentage difference pd between the b r x i i and g e v estimates as 14 p d f b r x i i 1 1 1 t f g e v 1 1 1 t 1 100 and similarly for g e v by applying several return periods t commonly used for engineering purpose i e 50 100 200 500 and 1000 years our results show that the b r x i i predicts larger values compared to the other two distributions fig 10 indeed the median pd values are positive for all return periods the predicted rainfall values by the b r x i i for the 50 years return period are comparable with those of the g e v and g e v yet as return period increases up to 1000 years the pd becomes much larger with median higher than 15 notably a larger variance is observed in the pd values evaluated for the g e v compared to g e v which also increases with the return period this greater variance is explained because when g e v has Œ≥ 0 it predicts always lower rainfall values than b r x i i and thus the pd is positive in contrast it seems that in the g e v when essentially the gumbel is used to describe the negative shape parameter cases the b r x i i can predict less and this even creates negative pd values and the larger variance 4 3 rainfall maps for fixed return periods here we evaluate the spatial variation of the predicted precipitation for different return periods indeed the knowledge of rainfall patterns for particular return periods is a necessity for flood mapping and for designing hydraulic structures van de vyver 2012 based on the previous results we estimate the rainfall amount that on average is exceeded once every t years rainfall depths h are evaluated with the quantile functions of the three tested distributions that are b r x i i g e v and g e v differences in terms of rainfall values predicted by the three distributions for three representative return periods are shown in fig 11 for a clear representation of the differences previously discussed in fig 10 we grouped the rainfall values in six percentile classes see the legend in fig 11 that were evaluated for each return period as anticipated the three tested distributions exhibit in general the same spatial patterns fig 11 the highest rainfall values greater than the 95th percentile are in the alpine zone in liguria in the north of tuscany and in specific parts of calabria and apulia the same areas have been previously recognized as the ones with the highest values of mean daily rainfall fig 2b most of the adriatic coast is characterized by predicted values lower than the 25th percentile the extension of the apennine plays a crucial role for this behavior the occidental winds from the tyrrhenian sea are blocked by the mountain chain causing orographic rainfall the same behavior is found nearby the alps as the mountain chain blocks the winds from the north and protect the po valley in the south and in the two major islands we observe that the highest values of the rainfall depth are characteristics of the highest elevation the identified patterns remain roughly constant for smaller return periods yet careful inspection shows strong differences for the 1000 years period we further investigated the differences emerged in fig 11 by analysing the subdivision of the cells into the six percentile classes fig 12 at 50 years of return period the behavior is approximately the same for the three distributions consistently with the results obtained for e r i v fig 9d the higher variance already emerged in fig 10 for the g e v is reflected in a greater number of cells falling in the higher percentile classes by increasing the return period the potential large under estimation by the g e v distribution is found in many cells belonging to the first two percentile classes these results indicate that for many regions in italy the g e v distribution could potentially severely underestimate the magnitude of extremes for large return periods 4 4 relationship between rainfall depth and orography the spatial patterns emerged in the rainfall maps fig 11 seem to follow the orography of the country fig 1a to investigate this aspect we show in fig 13 a bivariate choropleth map to evaluate the correlation between the elevation above the sea level hereinafter q and the classes of rainfall depths to perform this comparison we choose the g e v to estimate the rainfall depths for several return periods i e 39 50 100 200 500 and 1000 years the highest values of elevation and rainfall depths whose grid cells are depicted with darkest purple blue colours are mostly located along the alps and the apennine particularly the alpine and pre alpine areas present heavier rainfall values with respect to the apennine chain at lower altitudes classes with q close to its median value a greater variability emerged in the distribution of rainfall with lower values light orange colours on the left of the legend along the apennine especially on the adriatic coast and higher values in the north purple values on the right of the legend the same variability can be observed over the flat areas mainly located along the coasts and in the po valley the lowest rainfall values are located on the adriatic and lazio coasts white cells blue and light blue cells are representative of greater values of precipitation over the plains see the po valley in fig 13 the relationship between the elevation and the rainfall depth does not change with the return period to highlight the above aspects we provide six different maps for each class of elevation in figure s3 of the supplementary material 5 summary and conclusions catastrophic events in italy such as floods and landslides have caused significant infrastructures damage an economic loss a robust estimation of rainfall depths for different return periods is crucial to plan and design hydraulic protection infrastructure to alleviate the impact of extremes the generalize extreme value g e v distribution is the most popular model to describe extreme rainfall worldwide yet it should be used with caution theoretical assumptions justifying the use of g e v are often violated in real world and thus we suggest using g e v with a priori restricting its shape parameter to positive values we name this variant the g e v we believe that using a distribution bounded from above such as the reverse weibull g e v with negative shape parameter is not consistent with natural processes limited at zero such as precipitation to support our statements we also used the burr type xii b r x i i distribution a non extreme value distribution defined in 0 to describe annual maxima and to compare it with g e v the b r x i i has the same asymptotic behavior with the g e v distribution which makes the comparison of the tail behavior valid the fitting performance and the spatial variability of the g e v are tested on 13 247 daily rainfall time series over italy using l moments our analysis reveals that 1 the g e v distribution in 44 9 of the samples had a negative shape parameter implying an upper daily rainfall limit fig 6 return periods related to these upper limits however are finite when estimated with the b r x i i distribution this indicates that upper bounds estimated by g e v might be artifacts caused by sample variations thus we suggest using the g e v only with positive shape parameters g e v 2 comparison of the right tail between the g e v and b r x i i distributions reveals notable differences although they have the same asymptotic behavior when Œ≥ 0 the b r x i i tails resulted heavier than the g e v tails especially when the shape parameter Œ≥ of g e v is lower than 0 2 nevertheless the spatial representation of g e v s positive shape parameter for the 55 1 of the samples allowed to identify many regions with heavy tails fig 8 3 the b r x i i g e v and g e v performed almost identically for the observed return period i e 39 years fig 9d although these models are heavy tailed they underestimate the observed rainfall maximum in 74 78 5 and 69 3 of the analysed samples respectively 4 the b r x i i for large return periods predicts larger rainfall amounts compared to the g e v estimates fig 10 this might indicate that g e v estimates could underestimate the risk of extremes 5 the rainfall spatial patterns emerged by fitting the three distributions are similar for the selected return periods the estimated rainfall depth tends to follow the orography of the territory with high rainfall at high altitude and moderate rainfall over the plains fig 13 this result confirmed the important role played by the high mountain chains on the rainfall distribution in italy these maps might be useful to update and integrate the estimated rainfall depths for fixed return periods evaluated with the rain gauge network based on the previous findings we suggest using the g e v instead of the classical g e v distribution but also include in the analysis non extreme value distributions such as the b r x i i to describe precipitation extremes it is impossible to verify which model predicts more accurately the extremes for large period however since the three models underestimate the observed sample maximum we could claim that the one underestimating it less might be a better choice authors statement benedetta moccia data curation formal analysis methodology visualization writing original draft writing review editing simon

8162,study region kuma river watershed in japan study focus high quality precipitation information is desirable in hydrological modeling and water resources management this study aimed to generate long term fine resolution precipitation datasets over the study region a hybrid downscaling framework that integrates a dynamical approach by the weather research and forecasting wrf model and a deep learning approach by the convolutional neural network cnn model was proposed to derive precipitation information at fine resolutions from era interim datasets the proposed hybrid downscaling framework was then applied to a coastal watershed in japan the merit of the hybrid downscaling approach in generating precipitation datasets at a 6 km resolution from 80 km era interim datasets and 54 km and 18 km wrf simulated gridded datasets was explored as an alternative to pure dynamical downscaling approach by wrf new hydrological insights for the region the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficients of daily basin averaged precipitation at 6 km resolution obtained by cnn from era interim 54 km and 18 km wrf simulated datasets were 0 79 0 93 and 0 98 respectively for training period 0 71 0 85 and 0 96 respectively for validation when compared to 6 km wrf simulated gridded precipitation the results demonstrated that cnn can reproduce 6 km wrf simulated precipitation and fine resolution wrf modeling is needed to further enhance the downscaling performance especially to capture spatial heterogeneity and extreme events the hybrid downscaling framework of precipitation is promising to preserve the physics of atmospheric dynamics in precipitation modeling and reduce the computational cost considerably compared to pure dynamical downscaling keywords wrf convolutional neural network precipitation downscaling deep learning 1 introduction precipitation is one of the most critical components in hydrology and is a key variable of the environment and society as precipitation serves as essential freshwater sources to the human and ecosystems and also has direct impacts on water resources management high resolution precipitation datasets are of significance in the hydrologic impact studies global climate models gcms and reanalysis datasets are primary tools that are used to evaluate the potential climate change impacts over long temporal and large spatial scales however gcms with a resolution of 100 km 200 km can be difficult to adequately represent mesoscale atmospheric processes complex topography and land sea distribution schmidli et al 2007 consequently the direct application of large scale hydro climatic outputs is difficult for regional studies especially for precipitation daily precipitation at local scales usually does not show strong correlation with the large scale circulations chen et al 2011 statistical downscaling and dynamical downscaling approaches are widely used to downscale coarse climate information to regional scales of interest toride et al 2018 ma et al 2020 statistical downscaling constructs statistical relationship between the regional scale climate variables and certain large scale atmospheric parameters in space and time heikkil√§ et al 2011 sun et al 2016 ghorbanpour et al 2021 lima et al 2021 though computationally cheap the statistical downscaling approach assumes that statistical relationships remain unchanged over time and requires long term climate observation datasets that are usually not widely available dynamical downscaling with regional climate models rcms which accounts for physical atmospheric dynamics with complex local processes provides an alternative to statistical downscaling rcms is often forced by gcms or reanalysis datasets a major drawback of the dynamical downscaling is that it requires much larger computational resources than statistical downscaling however rcms can provide a full range of physically consistent local scale climate variables by incorporating a better representation of mesoscale processes and surface forcings and resolving regional heterogeneity originated from sources such as complex topography and land sea distribution feser et al 2011 torma et al 2015 high resolution rcms are attractive for precipitation downscaling as precipitation generally presents large variability in space and time along with altitude especially for extreme precipitation estimation the weather research and forecast wrf model skamarock et al 2008 which is developed as a global community numerical weather prediction system for atmospheric research has been widely used as an rcm for dynamical downscaling of precipitation bukovsky and karoly 2009 heikkil√§ et al 2011 sun et al 2016 posada mar√≠n et al 2019 tu et al 2020 dynamical downscaling of precipitation by wrf has been implemented at scales that are below 10 km sun et al 2016 applied wrf to generate 4 km resolution summer precipitation in central plains zhang et al 2018 used wrf to derive two dynamically downscaled precipitation datasets of the heihe river basin in china at 3 km resolution and found that wrf can satisfactorily reproduce the observed spatial patterns of precipitation though meteorologically consistent high resolution downscaling is desirable for evaluating extreme precipitation events and hydrologic impact studies the high demanding computational resources of the dynamical downscaling at scales finer than 10 km makes this approach unfavorable for long term simulations the hybrid downscaling approach is a combination of both statistical and dynamical downscaling the general idea is that dynamical downscaling with an rcm provides regional scale climate variables for statistical methods to establish the statistical relationship between some of these variables and the large scale variables the hybrid approach is attractive as it can reduce computational demands of pure dynamical downscaling approach and at the same time preserves a reasonable representation of the regional scale climate dynamics walton et al 2015 sun et al 2015 anh and taniguchi 2018 madaus et al 2020 limited applications of the hybrid downscaling approach have been found in the precipitation research bechler et al 2015 tested the application of cumulative density function transform and a linear regression model to wrf outputs of a 0 44 resolution to investigate extreme precipitation events in the south of france berg et al 2015 coupled the wrf simulations with empirical orthogonal function analysis to study precipitation changes over the los angeles regions in the 21st century with a growing interest of machine learning ml and deep learning dl applications ml or dl based models have also been explored as statistical downscaling methods for precipitation sachindra et al 2018 tran anh et al 2019 vandal et al 2019 s√∏nderby et al 2020 trinh et al 2021 these applications belong to the statistical models and can also have the similar drawbacks as statistical downscaling approaches anh and taniguchi 2018 applied a 5 layer feed forward artificial neural network to describe the statistical relationship between wrf downscaled results at a 30 km resolution and at a 6 km resolution to study the rainfall patterns in the red river delta vietnam compared to the traditional artificial neural network architecture superior performance has been found in dl algorithm based applications and the convolutional neural network cnn that is a dl based algorithm has been applied in various fields including hydrology and outperformed the state of the art ml methods fang et al 2017 shen et al 2018 pan et al 2019 wang et al 2020 the cnn architecture can take the spatial local correlation into consideration making it promising for precipitation simulations as precipitation data is structured in space pan et al 2019 used a cnn model for daily precipitation prediction over the contiguous united states and found the cnn model provides better predictions than reanalysis precipitation products and those by traditional ml methods such as linear regression random forest nearest neighbor and fully connected deep neural network however limited efforts have been made to incorporate the cnn into the hybrid precipitation downscaling applications in this study we propose a hybrid precipitation downscaling framework that combines wrf and the cnn the hybrid approach wrf cnn is applied over a costal watershed the kuma river watershed krw in the kumamoto prefecture japan krw has historically suffered from severe floods furthermore climate change may enhance the intensity and frequency of floods in krw in the future it is urgently required to accurately estimate the climate change impacts on precipitation at krw for planning of flood control under a changing climate the wrf modeling is driven by era interim reanalysis datasets which are of about 80 km grid resolution and the wrf produces daily results of three different spatial resolutions that are 54 km 18 km and 6 km different cnn models are constructed based on the resolution of datasets used or generated in wrf this study aims to illustrate 1 the performance of wrf modeling in this region when extensively validated with the aphrodite asian precipitation highly resolved observational data integration towards evaluation of water resources yatagai et al 2012 aphrodite s gridded daily precipitation from 1951 to present covers russia middle east monsoon asia and japan and the horizontal resolution over japan is of 0 05 by 0 05 degree 2 the applicability of the wrf cnn hybrid downscaling approach at different spatial scales in downscaling the precipitation fields from coarse resolution 80 km 54 km 18 km to fine resolution 6 km 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area krw is an important watershed at the kumamoto prefecture which is located in the kyushu region japan fig 1 the length of the kuma river is 115 km the catchment size of krw is 1 880 km2 the elevations of krw range from 0 m to 1 739 m the main stem of kuma river is originated from the minakami peak 1 458 m 32 27 05 n 130 58 40 e it flows southward and goes westward through the hitoyoshi valley after flowing northward through the narrow valley section and the yatsushiro plain it flows into the yatsushiro sea although there are many small branches there is only one major blanch of the kuma river which is called the kawabe river the confluence point is at approximately 66 km from the river mouse the kawabe river originates from the kunimi peak 1 739 m n32 32 50 e131 01 06 the krw has historically suffered from severe floods there is a major rainy season in japan which is called the baiu season a stationary weather front baiu front generally stays around japan from june to july during the baiu season high moisture atmospheric flow hit the baiu front and then sometimes causes severe precipitation the krw is located at the south west sector of the kyushu region meanwhile such high moisture atmospheric flows mostly come from west or from south west when a baiu front stays near the krw high moisture atmospheric flows easily cause heavy precipitation over the watershed in addition tropical cyclones typhoons also hit krw from july to october almost every year because krw is near the ocean typhoons cause severe precipitation over krw by obtaining moisture from the ocean 2 2 dynamical downscaling the wrf model version 3 9 0 was used for precipitation simulations over krw fig 1 a high resolution regional climate modeling is achieved by using three one way nested grids with 54 km 18 km and 6 km resolutions and with 25 27 31 37 49 64 grid points respectively fig 1 the initial and boundary conditions for wrf simulations are from 6 hourly 0 75 0 75 gridded era interim datasets berrisford et al 2011 all domains have 40 vertical levels and the model top is fixed at 50 hpa wrf provides a wide range of options for physical parameterization the physical parameterizations in this study were carefully selected based on simulations conducted in similar regions and wrf test runs in this region the local climate of krw was simulated from 1980 to 2015 continuously adaptive time stepping was used in the simulation daily precipitation from era interim was obtained from 3 hourly and 6 hly precipitations in japan time which is 9 h different from utc the wrf results were output every hour an overview of the wrf model physical parameterization is provided in table 1 the resulting wrf outputs are referred based on their spatial resolution as wrf54 km wrf18 km and wrf6 km respectively 2 3 statistical downscaling the architecture of cnns as a class of neural networks includes an input layer hidden layers and an output layer in a traditional neural network neurons are fully connected between two consecutive layers and neurons do not share connection within the same layer o shea and nash 2015 the local correlation within the dataset cannot be considered in such a network to account for local correlation cnns adopt the convolutional and pooling layers in the hidden layers to extract local patterns and also prohibit remote connection to increase computational efficiency this feature makes it very attractive for modeling geophysical processes as local correlation plays an important role in these processes precipitation fields from era interim and wrf outputs of variable grid resolutions are used to construct different cnn models and in this way the impact of resolution of the input datasets on the downscaling performance can be evaluated the general hybrid wrf cnn framework in this study is shown in fig 2 two convolutional layers two max pooling layers and two fully connected layers are used in the cnn architecture fig 2a the input sizes of two dimensional precipitation fields of era interim wrf 54 km and wrf 18 km are 5 5 7 6 and 13 10 respectively batch normalization is applied between a convolutional layer and a max pooling layer the relu activation function is utilized between the fully connected layers before given to the first convolutional layer the input precipitation fields are normalized by their maximum and minimum values so as to range between zero and one the kernel sizes of the convolutional layers and the max pooling layers are set to be 3 3 and 2 2 respectively and the strides of the convolutional layers and the max pooling layer are set to be 1 1 and 2 2 respectively to extract key features that are critical for precipitation estimation padding is employed for each convolutional and max pooling layer to mitigate the reduction of the feature size the number of neurons of the first fully connected layer depends on the input size and that of the second fully connected layer is set to be 512 to operate on the extracted features from convolutional and pooling layers to evaluate precipitation the output size of daily precipitation is 164 which is the number of the subwatersheds the mini batch gradient descent method is utilized for the training the batch size is 512 the batch is generated by the shuffling batch selecting method this study employs mean square error mse as the loss function and adam kingma and ba 2014 as the optimization algorithms details of the cnn architecture and related terminology can be found in o shea and nash 2015 the precipitation datasets are divided into three subsets the training dataset 1980 2005 the validation dataset 2006 2010 and the test dataset 2011 2015 2 4 hybrid downscaling by wrf cnn the hybrid downscaling framework of precipitation downscaling couples wrf and cnn fig 2b the outputs from wrf were used as inputs to the cnn models the cnns were trained based on inputs that are of different resolutions the target downscaling resolution is 6 km and it was referred as cnn 6 km the performance of cnn downscaling was evaluated by comparing the resulting cnn 6 km results with wrf 6 km results the downscaling performance was evaluated based on 4 metrics nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse pbias root mean square error rmse and correlation coefficient r these metrics are calculated by 1 n s e 1 i

the observed precipitation m is the simulated precipitation o and m are the mean observed and simulated precipitation respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 dynamical downscaled precipitation by wrf the long term 1980 2015 daily mean precipitation at individual sub basins from the observational grids aphrodite and the regional climate models wrf6 km wrf18 km wrf54 km and era interim was shown in fig 3 a noticeable northwest southeast gradient of precipitation was observed in fig 3 compared with the precipitation in the aphrodite dataset wrf downscaled 6 km and 18 km results can produce precipitation of similar spatial heterogeneity over the watershed though overestimation and underestimation occurred in different subwatersheds precipitation from wrf54 km and era interim cannot show clear spatial patterns as that observed in aphrodite due to the coarse resolution of the grids the spatial heterogeneity of the precipitation fields clearly indicated that high resolution datasets are needed to account for the spatial pattern of the precipitation basin averaged monthly precipitation from 1980 to 2015 was illustrated in fig 4 a the performance of the basin averaged daily and monthly precipitation was tabulated in table 2 the general monthly precipitation fluctuation from wrf and era interim results was consistent with the aphrodite fig 4 showed that wrf6 km can best capture the magnitude of the observed monthly precipitation and the results obtained from other resolutions underestimated the precipitation in most of the months the empirical probability density of the precipitation in fig 4b is consistent with the temporal variation in fig 4a the tails of results by wrf54 km and era interim are lower than those by aphrodite indicating a potential underestimation of heavy rainstorms the precipitation distribution curves in fig 4b generally have the same peak points in wrf derived results and aphrodite and era interim shows double peaks wrf 6 km outputs deviates the least from the mean precipitation derived from aphrodite among the four gridded results wrf 54 km wrf 18 km wrf 6 km and era interim the monthly basin averaged precipitation across years show that in heavy storm seasons june and july results at different resolutions indicate great variability and the difference is not so obvious in other months compared with aphrodite fig 4c precipitation in june shows the largest mean precipitation based on aphrodite and only wrf 6 km can produce comparable precipitation and the other gridded datasets shows much lower precipitation this is consistent with the indices in table 2 where the percent of bias for wrf6 km was 3 81 and for wrf18 km wrf54 km era interim was 7 38 10 35 and 22 81 respectively based on the performance metrics in table 2 wrf6 km produced the best precipitation results in terms of basin averaged precipitation without bias correction nse and r of the monthly basin averaged precipitation from wrf6 km were 0 84 and 0 92 which showed good agreement with the observation therefore results from wrf6 km were used as a reference to illustrate the applicability of cnn when compared with wrf downscaling 3 2 basin averaged downscaled daily precipitation by wrf cnn for the application of cnn downscaling the daily precipitation datasets from 1980 to 2015 were divided into 3 periods training 1980 2005 validation 2006 2010 and test 2011 2015 basin averaged daily precipitation from 1980 to 2015 by hybrid downscaling wrf cnn was shown in fig 5 wrf precipitation simulation results of 54 km and 18 km grids and era interim precipitation fields were used as the input for cnn downscaling fig 5a indicated that the cnn downscaled precipitation that takes wrf18 km results had the best visual agreement with the 6 km dynamically downscaled precipitation though occasionally presenting overestimation of the basin averaged precipitation the empirical probability density of the precipitation by the hybrid downscaling approach is shown in fig 5b the precipitation distribution curves in fig 5c generally have the same peak points though wrf 54 km shows the largest probability at the peak location consequently the mean precipitation by wrf 18 km and era interim is very close to that by wrf 6 km and the wrf 54 km generates lower mean precipitation than wrf 6 km the lower ends of the probability curves show that the precipitation by the hybrid approach generates fewer dry periods than that in wrf 6 km as the probability at zero precipitation is the largest in wrf 6 km among the four datasets the tail of results by the hybrid approach is comparable with that by wrf 6 km indicating an overall good agreement with the large rain events at the monthly scale the monthly basin averaged precipitation across years show that cnn with wrf 18 km inputs generates similar patterns in june the largest mean precipitation season over the watershed compared with wrf 6 km outputs a detailed evaluation of the basin averaged precipitation between wrf6 km and the cnn downscaled results was provided in table 3 which is consistent with fig 5 the precipitation cnn downscaled from wrf18 km showed the best overall performance that has nse and r values greater than 0 95 for all three periods and showed the smallest rmse in mm the pbias calculated based on cnn downscaled precipitation from era interim was the smallest this can be due to the fact that the pbias accounts for the overall performance of the simulation when compared with the long term average precipitation and era interim downscaled results tend to overestimate and underestimate in a very similar amount which results in a deceiving rating of the performance 3 3 spatial distribution of downscaled daily precipitation by wrf cnn cnn downscaled daily precipitation at each individual subwatershed 164 in total was compared with the corresponding results from wrf6 km for training validation and test periods the overall performance of the downscaled precipitation was shown by the boxplots in fig 6 based on the four metrics the cnn downscaled precipitation based on wrf18 km showed the best performance and era interim presented the largest deviations from wrf6 km precipitation moreover fig 6 indicated that results produced from wrf18 km fields were more stable than those obtained from the other two inputs during different simulation periods the relatively stable performance illustrated that the cnn model can adequately capture the key dynamics of the precipitation simulation based on inputs from wrf18 km the spatial characteristics of each metric were shown in figs 7 8 and supplementary figures for nse pbias rmse and r the spatial distribution of nse was provided in fig 7 for era interim first row in fig 7 wrf54 km second row in fig 7 and wrf18 km third row in fig 7 fig 7 clearly showed that the nses of downscaled precipitation over most subwatersheds by using wrf18 km as the cnn inputs were greater than 0 9 for the three simulation periods between 0 84 and 0 96 mean sd 0 914 0 025 the range of nses of cnn downscaled precipitation from wrf54 km results was between 0 77 0 89 0 802 0 042 and from era interim results was between 0 46 and 0 73 0 654 0 055 fig 8 presented the spatial distribution of the percentage of bias between the cnn downscaled precipitation and corresponding wrf6 km results the range of pbias for wrf18 km cnn downscaled precipitation was between 14 06 and 4 42 3 368 3 594 and between 23 69 and 12 23 5 221 5 826 for wrf54 km inputs and between 17 03 and 14 14 0 561 5 485 for era interim inputs the results in figs 6 8 were consistent and indicated the good performance of the cnn downscaled results from wrf18 km inputs the rmse and r of the downscaled daily precipitation can refer to figs s1 s2 in the appendix in terms of computational efficiency compared with downscaling by cnns it requires much more computational resources to downscale variables at a finer resolution by an rcm to decrease the size of the model grids by one third from 18 km to 6 km the number of grids will increase nine times furthermore a finer resolution of the model grids requires a finer computational time step consequently it will take several hours to several days for one year of downscaling at a 6 km resolution depending on the used computer system and the size of the target area and other factors contrarily downscaling by cnn for a year requires only less than one second when it runs on a graphics processing unit gpu under test meanwhile it is usually required to downscale multiple future climate projections for climate change impact assessment in order to take uncertainties into consideration consequently the downscaling process needs to be conducted for hundreds of years climate conditions thus the proposed hybrid downscaling approach will be able to significantly reduce the required computational resources moreover the focus of this study is to explore the capability of wrf cnn in mimicking wrf simulated precipitation fields future work can investigate the comparison between results of wrf cnn with the observation aphrodite directly 4 conclusions a hybrid downscaling method that uses wrf and cnn was applied to generate precipitation datasets at 6 km resolution from 80 km era interim datasets and 54 km and 18 km wrf simulated gridded datasets the cnn downscaled precipitation was compared to the direct wrf downscaled 6 km results the results demonstrate that downscaling by wrf may still be needed to provide results at intermediate scales and in this way the resulting cnn results can be improved considerably with higher resolution precipitation inputs to cnns the cnn results can better capture the heterogeneity of the precipitation fields and better match of the cnn with the wrf downscaled results can be observed the hybrid downscaling scheme which combines wrf and cnn downscaling processes can be appealing as this scheme can account for physical dynamics of the precipitation process and can also save computational time while preserving acceptable downscaling accuracy for example nse and r values are within 0 70 0 79 and 0 84 0 89 respectively when 80 km era interim dataset is utilized within 0 85 0 93 and 0 92 0 96 when 54 km wrf simulated dataset is utilized and within 0 96 0 98 and 0 98 0 99 when 18 km wrf simulated dataset is utilized table 3 furthermore it is found that the downscaled precipitation fields can be obtained satisfactorily by the hybrid downscaling method in a more time efficient manner when compared with direct wrf downscaled results in other words the proposed hybrid downscaling procedure offers a promising avenue to balance the conflict between relieving computation burden and preserving physical mechanics of the downscaling to conclude this study shows the potential of deep learning techniques that are promising to reproduce the physical processes in wrf in terms of precipitation modeling the current downscaling experiments only focus on precipitation and takes precipitation as the only input variable to the cnns with more precipitation related hydroclimatic variables added as inputs an enhanced characterization of the precipitation process can be expected credit authorship contribution statement tongbi tu kei ishida ali ercan masato kiyama motoki

8162,study region kuma river watershed in japan study focus high quality precipitation information is desirable in hydrological modeling and water resources management this study aimed to generate long term fine resolution precipitation datasets over the study region a hybrid downscaling framework that integrates a dynamical approach by the weather research and forecasting wrf model and a deep learning approach by the convolutional neural network cnn model was proposed to derive precipitation information at fine resolutions from era interim datasets the proposed hybrid downscaling framework was then applied to a coastal watershed in japan the merit of the hybrid downscaling approach in generating precipitation datasets at a 6 km resolution from 80 km era interim datasets and 54 km and 18 km wrf simulated gridded datasets was explored as an alternative to pure dynamical downscaling approach by wrf new hydrological insights for the region the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficients of daily basin averaged precipitation at 6 km resolution obtained by cnn from era interim 54 km and 18 km wrf simulated datasets were 0 79 0 93 and 0 98 respectively for training period 0 71 0 85 and 0 96 respectively for validation when compared to 6 km wrf simulated gridded precipitation the results demonstrated that cnn can reproduce 6 km wrf simulated precipitation and fine resolution wrf modeling is needed to further enhance the downscaling performance especially to capture spatial heterogeneity and extreme events the hybrid downscaling framework of precipitation is promising to preserve the physics of atmospheric dynamics in precipitation modeling and reduce the computational cost considerably compared to pure dynamical downscaling keywords wrf convolutional neural network precipitation downscaling deep learning 1 introduction precipitation is one of the most critical components in hydrology and is a key variable of the environment and society as precipitation serves as essential freshwater sources to the human and ecosystems and also has direct impacts on water resources management high resolution precipitation datasets are of significance in the hydrologic impact studies global climate models gcms and reanalysis datasets are primary tools that are used to evaluate the potential climate change impacts over long temporal and large spatial scales however gcms with a resolution of 100 km 200 km can be difficult to adequately represent mesoscale atmospheric processes complex topography and land sea distribution schmidli et al 2007 consequently the direct application of large scale hydro climatic outputs is difficult for regional studies especially for precipitation daily precipitation at local scales usually does not show strong correlation with the large scale circulations chen et al 2011 statistical downscaling and dynamical downscaling approaches are widely used to downscale coarse climate information to regional scales of interest toride et al 2018 ma et al 2020 statistical downscaling constructs statistical relationship between the regional scale climate variables and certain large scale atmospheric parameters in space and time heikkil√§ et al 2011 sun et al 2016 ghorbanpour et al 2021 lima et al 2021 though computationally cheap the statistical downscaling approach assumes that statistical relationships remain unchanged over time and requires long term climate observation datasets that are usually not widely available dynamical downscaling with regional climate models rcms which accounts for physical atmospheric dynamics with complex local processes provides an alternative to statistical downscaling rcms is often forced by gcms or reanalysis datasets a major drawback of the dynamical downscaling is that it requires much larger computational resources than statistical downscaling however rcms can provide a full range of physically consistent local scale climate variables by incorporating a better representation of mesoscale processes and surface forcings and resolving regional heterogeneity originated from sources such as complex topography and land sea distribution feser et al 2011 torma et al 2015 high resolution rcms are attractive for precipitation downscaling as precipitation generally presents large variability in space and time along with altitude especially for extreme precipitation estimation the weather research and forecast wrf model skamarock et al 2008 which is developed as a global community numerical weather prediction system for atmospheric research has been widely used as an rcm for dynamical downscaling of precipitation bukovsky and karoly 2009 heikkil√§ et al 2011 sun et al 2016 posada mar√≠n et al 2019 tu et al 2020 dynamical downscaling of precipitation by wrf has been implemented at scales that are below 10 km sun et al 2016 applied wrf to generate 4 km resolution summer precipitation in central plains zhang et al 2018 used wrf to derive two dynamically downscaled precipitation datasets of the heihe river basin in china at 3 km resolution and found that wrf can satisfactorily reproduce the observed spatial patterns of precipitation though meteorologically consistent high resolution downscaling is desirable for evaluating extreme precipitation events and hydrologic impact studies the high demanding computational resources of the dynamical downscaling at scales finer than 10 km makes this approach unfavorable for long term simulations the hybrid downscaling approach is a combination of both statistical and dynamical downscaling the general idea is that dynamical downscaling with an rcm provides regional scale climate variables for statistical methods to establish the statistical relationship between some of these variables and the large scale variables the hybrid approach is attractive as it can reduce computational demands of pure dynamical downscaling approach and at the same time preserves a reasonable representation of the regional scale climate dynamics walton et al 2015 sun et al 2015 anh and taniguchi 2018 madaus et al 2020 limited applications of the hybrid downscaling approach have been found in the precipitation research bechler et al 2015 tested the application of cumulative density function transform and a linear regression model to wrf outputs of a 0 44 resolution to investigate extreme precipitation events in the south of france berg et al 2015 coupled the wrf simulations with empirical orthogonal function analysis to study precipitation changes over the los angeles regions in the 21st century with a growing interest of machine learning ml and deep learning dl applications ml or dl based models have also been explored as statistical downscaling methods for precipitation sachindra et al 2018 tran anh et al 2019 vandal et al 2019 s√∏nderby et al 2020 trinh et al 2021 these applications belong to the statistical models and can also have the similar drawbacks as statistical downscaling approaches anh and taniguchi 2018 applied a 5 layer feed forward artificial neural network to describe the statistical relationship between wrf downscaled results at a 30 km resolution and at a 6 km resolution to study the rainfall patterns in the red river delta vietnam compared to the traditional artificial neural network architecture superior performance has been found in dl algorithm based applications and the convolutional neural network cnn that is a dl based algorithm has been applied in various fields including hydrology and outperformed the state of the art ml methods fang et al 2017 shen et al 2018 pan et al 2019 wang et al 2020 the cnn architecture can take the spatial local correlation into consideration making it promising for precipitation simulations as precipitation data is structured in space pan et al 2019 used a cnn model for daily precipitation prediction over the contiguous united states and found the cnn model provides better predictions than reanalysis precipitation products and those by traditional ml methods such as linear regression random forest nearest neighbor and fully connected deep neural network however limited efforts have been made to incorporate the cnn into the hybrid precipitation downscaling applications in this study we propose a hybrid precipitation downscaling framework that combines wrf and the cnn the hybrid approach wrf cnn is applied over a costal watershed the kuma river watershed krw in the kumamoto prefecture japan krw has historically suffered from severe floods furthermore climate change may enhance the intensity and frequency of floods in krw in the future it is urgently required to accurately estimate the climate change impacts on precipitation at krw for planning of flood control under a changing climate the wrf modeling is driven by era interim reanalysis datasets which are of about 80 km grid resolution and the wrf produces daily results of three different spatial resolutions that are 54 km 18 km and 6 km different cnn models are constructed based on the resolution of datasets used or generated in wrf this study aims to illustrate 1 the performance of wrf modeling in this region when extensively validated with the aphrodite asian precipitation highly resolved observational data integration towards evaluation of water resources yatagai et al 2012 aphrodite s gridded daily precipitation from 1951 to present covers russia middle east monsoon asia and japan and the horizontal resolution over japan is of 0 05 by 0 05 degree 2 the applicability of the wrf cnn hybrid downscaling approach at different spatial scales in downscaling the precipitation fields from coarse resolution 80 km 54 km 18 km to fine resolution 6 km 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area krw is an important watershed at the kumamoto prefecture which is located in the kyushu region japan fig 1 the length of the kuma river is 115 km the catchment size of krw is 1 880 km2 the elevations of krw range from 0 m to 1 739 m the main stem of kuma river is originated from the minakami peak 1 458 m 32 27 05 n 130 58 40 e it flows southward and goes westward through the hitoyoshi valley after flowing northward through the narrow valley section and the yatsushiro plain it flows into the yatsushiro sea although there are many small branches there is only one major blanch of the kuma river which is called the kawabe river the confluence point is at approximately 66 km from the river mouse the kawabe river originates from the kunimi peak 1 739 m n32 32 50 e131 01 06 the krw has historically suffered from severe floods there is a major rainy season in japan which is called the baiu season a stationary weather front baiu front generally stays around japan from june to july during the baiu season high moisture atmospheric flow hit the baiu front and then sometimes causes severe precipitation the krw is located at the south west sector of the kyushu region meanwhile such high moisture atmospheric flows mostly come from west or from south west when a baiu front stays near the krw high moisture atmospheric flows easily cause heavy precipitation over the watershed in addition tropical cyclones typhoons also hit krw from july to october almost every year because krw is near the ocean typhoons cause severe precipitation over krw by obtaining moisture from the ocean 2 2 dynamical downscaling the wrf model version 3 9 0 was used for precipitation simulations over krw fig 1 a high resolution regional climate modeling is achieved by using three one way nested grids with 54 km 18 km and 6 km resolutions and with 25 27 31 37 49 64 grid points respectively fig 1 the initial and boundary conditions for wrf simulations are from 6 hourly 0 75 0 75 gridded era interim datasets berrisford et al 2011 all domains have 40 vertical levels and the model top is fixed at 50 hpa wrf provides a wide range of options for physical parameterization the physical parameterizations in this study were carefully selected based on simulations conducted in similar regions and wrf test runs in this region the local climate of krw was simulated from 1980 to 2015 continuously adaptive time stepping was used in the simulation daily precipitation from era interim was obtained from 3 hourly and 6 hly precipitations in japan time which is 9 h different from utc the wrf results were output every hour an overview of the wrf model physical parameterization is provided in table 1 the resulting wrf outputs are referred based on their spatial resolution as wrf54 km wrf18 km and wrf6 km respectively 2 3 statistical downscaling the architecture of cnns as a class of neural networks includes an input layer hidden layers and an output layer in a traditional neural network neurons are fully connected between two consecutive layers and neurons do not share connection within the same layer o shea and nash 2015 the local correlation within the dataset cannot be considered in such a network to account for local correlation cnns adopt the convolutional and pooling layers in the hidden layers to extract local patterns and also prohibit remote connection to increase computational efficiency this feature makes it very attractive for modeling geophysical processes as local correlation plays an important role in these processes precipitation fields from era interim and wrf outputs of variable grid resolutions are used to construct different cnn models and in this way the impact of resolution of the input datasets on the downscaling performance can be evaluated the general hybrid wrf cnn framework in this study is shown in fig 2 two convolutional layers two max pooling layers and two fully connected layers are used in the cnn architecture fig 2a the input sizes of two dimensional precipitation fields of era interim wrf 54 km and wrf 18 km are 5 5 7 6 and 13 10 respectively batch normalization is applied between a convolutional layer and a max pooling layer the relu activation function is utilized between the fully connected layers before given to the first convolutional layer the input precipitation fields are normalized by their maximum and minimum values so as to range between zero and one the kernel sizes of the convolutional layers and the max pooling layers are set to be 3 3 and 2 2 respectively and the strides of the convolutional layers and the max pooling layer are set to be 1 1 and 2 2 respectively to extract key features that are critical for precipitation estimation padding is employed for each convolutional and max pooling layer to mitigate the reduction of the feature size the number of neurons of the first fully connected layer depends on the input size and that of the second fully connected layer is set to be 512 to operate on the extracted features from convolutional and pooling layers to evaluate precipitation the output size of daily precipitation is 164 which is the number of the subwatersheds the mini batch gradient descent method is utilized for the training the batch size is 512 the batch is generated by the shuffling batch selecting method this study employs mean square error mse as the loss function and adam kingma and ba 2014 as the optimization algorithms details of the cnn architecture and related terminology can be found in o shea and nash 2015 the precipitation datasets are divided into three subsets the training dataset 1980 2005 the validation dataset 2006 2010 and the test dataset 2011 2015 2 4 hybrid downscaling by wrf cnn the hybrid downscaling framework of precipitation downscaling couples wrf and cnn fig 2b the outputs from wrf were used as inputs to the cnn models the cnns were trained based on inputs that are of different resolutions the target downscaling resolution is 6 km and it was referred as cnn 6 km the performance of cnn downscaling was evaluated by comparing the resulting cnn 6 km results with wrf 6 km results the downscaling performance was evaluated based on 4 metrics nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nse pbias root mean square error rmse and correlation coefficient r these metrics are calculated by 1 n s e 1 i

the observed precipitation m is the simulated precipitation o and m are the mean observed and simulated precipitation respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 dynamical downscaled precipitation by wrf the long term 1980 2015 daily mean precipitation at individual sub basins from the observational grids aphrodite and the regional climate models wrf6 km wrf18 km wrf54 km and era interim was shown in fig 3 a noticeable northwest southeast gradient of precipitation was observed in fig 3 compared with the precipitation in the aphrodite dataset wrf downscaled 6 km and 18 km results can produce precipitation of similar spatial heterogeneity over the watershed though overestimation and underestimation occurred in different subwatersheds precipitation from wrf54 km and era interim cannot show clear spatial patterns as that observed in aphrodite due to the coarse resolution of the grids the spatial heterogeneity of the precipitation fields clearly indicated that high resolution datasets are needed to account for the spatial pattern of the precipitation basin averaged monthly precipitation from 1980 to 2015 was illustrated in fig 4 a the performance of the basin averaged daily and monthly precipitation was tabulated in table 2 the general monthly precipitation fluctuation from wrf and era interim results was consistent with the aphrodite fig 4 showed that wrf6 km can best capture the magnitude of the observed monthly precipitation and the results obtained from other resolutions underestimated the precipitation in most of the months the empirical probability density of the precipitation in fig 4b is consistent with the temporal variation in fig 4a the tails of results by wrf54 km and era interim are lower than those by aphrodite indicating a potential underestimation of heavy rainstorms the precipitation distribution curves in fig 4b generally have the same peak points in wrf derived results and aphrodite and era interim shows double peaks wrf 6 km outputs deviates the least from the mean precipitation derived from aphrodite among the four gridded results wrf 54 km wrf 18 km wrf 6 km and era interim the monthly basin averaged precipitation across years show that in heavy storm seasons june and july results at different resolutions indicate great variability and the difference is not so obvious in other months compared with aphrodite fig 4c precipitation in june shows the largest mean precipitation based on aphrodite and only wrf 6 km can produce comparable precipitation and the other gridded datasets shows much lower precipitation this is consistent with the indices in table 2 where the percent of bias for wrf6 km was 3 81 and for wrf18 km wrf54 km era interim was 7 38 10 35 and 22 81 respectively based on the performance metrics in table 2 wrf6 km produced the best precipitation results in terms of basin averaged precipitation without bias correction nse and r of the monthly basin averaged precipitation from wrf6 km were 0 84 and 0 92 which showed good agreement with the observation therefore results from wrf6 km were used as a reference to illustrate the applicability of cnn when compared with wrf downscaling 3 2 basin averaged downscaled daily precipitation by wrf cnn for the application of cnn downscaling the daily precipitation datasets from 1980 to 2015 were divided into 3 periods training 1980 2005 validation 2006 2010 and test 2011 2015 basin averaged daily precipitation from 1980 to 2015 by hybrid downscaling wrf cnn was shown in fig 5 wrf precipitation simulation results of 54 km and 18 km grids and era interim precipitation fields were used as the input for cnn downscaling fig 5a indicated that the cnn downscaled precipitation that takes wrf18 km results had the best visual agreement with the 6 km dynamically downscaled precipitation though occasionally presenting overestimation of the basin averaged precipitation the empirical probability density of the precipitation by the hybrid downscaling approach is shown in fig 5b the precipitation distribution curves in fig 5c generally have the same peak points though wrf 54 km shows the largest probability at the peak location consequently the mean precipitation by wrf 18 km and era interim is very close to that by wrf 6 km and the wrf 54 km generates lower mean precipitation than wrf 6 km the lower ends of the probability curves show that the precipitation by the hybrid approach generates fewer dry periods than that in wrf 6 km as the probability at zero precipitation is the largest in wrf 6 km among the four datasets the tail of results by the hybrid approach is comparable with that by wrf 6 km indicating an overall good agreement with the large rain events at the monthly scale the monthly basin averaged precipitation across years show that cnn with wrf 18 km inputs generates similar patterns in june the largest mean precipitation season over the watershed compared with wrf 6 km outputs a detailed evaluation of the basin averaged precipitation between wrf6 km and the cnn downscaled results was provided in table 3 which is consistent with fig 5 the precipitation cnn downscaled from wrf18 km showed the best overall performance that has nse and r values greater than 0 95 for all three periods and showed the smallest rmse in mm the pbias calculated based on cnn downscaled precipitation from era interim was the smallest this can be due to the fact that the pbias accounts for the overall performance of the simulation when compared with the long term average precipitation and era interim downscaled results tend to overestimate and underestimate in a very similar amount which results in a deceiving rating of the performance 3 3 spatial distribution of downscaled daily precipitation by wrf cnn cnn downscaled daily precipitation at each individual subwatershed 164 in total was compared with the corresponding results from wrf6 km for training validation and test periods the overall performance of the downscaled precipitation was shown by the boxplots in fig 6 based on the four metrics the cnn downscaled precipitation based on wrf18 km showed the best performance and era interim presented the largest deviations from wrf6 km precipitation moreover fig 6 indicated that results produced from wrf18 km fields were more stable than those obtained from the other two inputs during different simulation periods the relatively stable performance illustrated that the cnn model can adequately capture the key dynamics of the precipitation simulation based on inputs from wrf18 km the spatial characteristics of each metric were shown in figs 7 8 and supplementary figures for nse pbias rmse and r the spatial distribution of nse was provided in fig 7 for era interim first row in fig 7 wrf54 km second row in fig 7 and wrf18 km third row in fig 7 fig 7 clearly showed that the nses of downscaled precipitation over most subwatersheds by using wrf18 km as the cnn inputs were greater than 0 9 for the three simulation periods between 0 84 and 0 96 mean sd 0 914 0 025 the range of nses of cnn downscaled precipitation from wrf54 km results was between 0 77 0 89 0 802 0 042 and from era interim results was between 0 46 and 0 73 0 654 0 055 fig 8 presented the spatial distribution of the percentage of bias between the cnn downscaled precipitation and corresponding wrf6 km results the range of pbias for wrf18 km cnn downscaled precipitation was between 14 06 and 4 42 3 368 3 594 and between 23 69 and 12 23 5 221 5 826 for wrf54 km inputs and between 17 03 and 14 14 0 561 5 485 for era interim inputs the results in figs 6 8 were consistent and indicated the good performance of the cnn downscaled results from wrf18 km inputs the rmse and r of the downscaled daily precipitation can refer to figs s1 s2 in the appendix in terms of computational efficiency compared with downscaling by cnns it requires much more computational resources to downscale variables at a finer resolution by an rcm to decrease the size of the model grids by one third from 18 km to 6 km the number of grids will increase nine times furthermore a finer resolution of the model grids requires a finer computational time step consequently it will take several hours to several days for one year of downscaling at a 6 km resolution depending on the used computer system and the size of the target area and other factors contrarily downscaling by cnn for a year requires only less than one second when it runs on a graphics processing unit gpu under test meanwhile it is usually required to downscale multiple future climate projections for climate change impact assessment in order to take uncertainties into consideration consequently the downscaling process needs to be conducted for hundreds of years climate conditions thus the proposed hybrid downscaling approach will be able to significantly reduce the required computational resources moreover the focus of this study is to explore the capability of wrf cnn in mimicking wrf simulated precipitation fields future work can investigate the comparison between results of wrf cnn with the observation aphrodite directly 4 conclusions a hybrid downscaling method that uses wrf and cnn was applied to generate precipitation datasets at 6 km resolution from 80 km era interim datasets and 54 km and 18 km wrf simulated gridded datasets the cnn downscaled precipitation was compared to the direct wrf downscaled 6 km results the results demonstrate that downscaling by wrf may still be needed to provide results at intermediate scales and in this way the resulting cnn results can be improved considerably with higher resolution precipitation inputs to cnns the cnn results can better capture the heterogeneity of the precipitation fields and better match of the cnn with the wrf downscaled results can be observed the hybrid downscaling scheme which combines wrf and cnn downscaling processes can be appealing as this scheme can account for physical dynamics of the precipitation process and can also save computational time while preserving acceptable downscaling accuracy for example nse and r values are within 0 70 0 79 and 0 84 0 89 respectively when 80 km era interim dataset is utilized within 0 85 0 93 and 0 92 0 96 when 54 km wrf simulated dataset is utilized and within 0 96 0 98 and 0 98 0 99 when 18 km wrf simulated dataset is utilized table 3 furthermore it is found that the downscaled precipitation fields can be obtained satisfactorily by the hybrid downscaling method in a more time efficient manner when compared with direct wrf downscaled results in other words the proposed hybrid downscaling procedure offers a promising avenue to balance the conflict between relieving computation burden and preserving physical mechanics of the downscaling to conclude this study shows the potential of deep learning techniques that are promising to reproduce the physical processes in wrf in terms of precipitation modeling the current downscaling experiments only focus on precipitation and takes precipitation as the only input variable to the cnns with more precipitation related hydroclimatic variables added as inputs an enhanced characterization of the precipitation process can be expected credit authorship contribution statement tongbi tu kei ishida ali ercan masato kiyama motoki

8163,study region upper wabe shebelle river basin uwsrb ethiopia study focus this study investigated the spatio temporal patterns or trends and spatial distribution and variability of rainfall in seasonal and annual time series the rainfall variability was evaluated by the coefÔ¨Åcient of variation cv precipitation concentration index pci and standardized anomaly index sai the spatio temporal trends were also analyzed using the mann kendall test mk sen s slope estimators sse and the latest technique of innovative trend analysis ita method was used for analyzing the low medium and high rainfall clusters new hydrological insight for the region in most of the rainfall stations high amount of annual rainfall happened in the kiremt wet season and high rainfall variability was during the bega dry season during the annual rainfall the mk test and sse were statistically non significant in some stations and heavy rainfall was detected in the kiremt and belg transition seasons for the kiremt and annual period most rainfall stations showed high rainfall cluster and increasing trends while low rainfall was observed in bega season which exhibited decreasing trends the outcomes of comparison revealed that the ita method is more robust and surpassed the mk test as it could detect monotonic and non monotonic trends that cannot be observed by the mk method the result of this study is helpful for water resources planning and management in uwsrb keywords innovative trend analysis rainfall clusters mann kendall monotonic and non monotonic trend rainfall variability uwsrb 1 introduction increment in greenhouse gas concentration in the atmosphere is anticipated to be the major reason for climate change ipcc 2014 climate change is an increasing due to global warming and has a substantial impact not only on the functioning of our ecosystem but also on our socio economic development in today s world ipcc 2013 chang et al 2019 in sub saharan africa the long term change of climate associated with changes in precipitation patterns and variability and in the temperature is highly likely to raise the frequency of Ô¨Çoods and droughts ipcc et al 2012 in ethiopia agriculture is the dominant sector of the economy however it is highly vulnerable to climate shocks attributed to extremes such as drought and flood events world bank 2010 for example over the past decade rainfall anomalies indicate extreme wet periods in 1962 1966 1979 1998 99 and 2006 07 and extreme dry periods in years 1971 1973 1984 1986 1992 and 2002 2004 this variability of rainfall greatly affected the agricultural productivity pastoralists and animals seleshi and zanke 2004 therefore analyzing the spatio temporal distribution of rainfall and detecting trends is the key to sustaining agricultural production and healthy ecosystem functions krishan et al 2013 worku et al 2018 one of the noticeable impacts of climate change is variations in the processes and storages components of the hydrologic cycle wang et al 2020 rainfall being one of the core constituents processes in the hydrological cycle varies in spatial and temporal patterns due to the increase in the concentration of atmospheric gases wang et al 2020 an investigation into temporal trends and spatial distribution of rainfall is thus vital for sustainable water resource utilization and control of droughts and floods likewise a clear understanding of the spatio temporal distribution of precipitation is a one to model flood regulating structures such as detention dam and surface water storage brunsell et al 2010 bellu et al 2016 ter√™ncio et al 2018 therefore analyzing variations in rainfall patterns and possible trends in temporal and at spatial scales in such areas as upper wabe shebelle river basin is essential in setting possible mitigation measures and assessing ecosystem resilience vis √† vis flood and drought events in the past few decades several approaches have been developed to analyze the trend of rainfall using either non parametric or parametric methods such as the mann kendall test sen s slope spearman s rho test cumulative sum and linear regression karpouzos et al 2010 piao et al 2010 gocic and trajkovic 2013 westra et al 2013 pingale et al 2014 among these the mann kendall mk trend test method is the most commonly used technique wang et al 2020 seifu and abdulkarim 2006 employed the mk test to analyze the rainfall trend in ethiopia the results of their finding indicate that belg transition rainfall season does not show a significant trend while kiremt wet rainfall season shows a significant decreasing trend during the period of 1973 2002 westra et al 2013 analyzed monotonic trends in annual maximum daily precipitation globally by applying the mann kendall test spearman s rho test and linear regression the findings showed statistically signiÔ¨Åcant increasing trends at the global scale close to two thirds of the stations showed increases over the period 1900 2009 gemmer et al 2011 applied the mann kendall test to investigate rainfall trends in the zhujiang basin their finding indicated that few of the stations under their study resulted trends in the precipitation indices on annual basis patra et al 2012 investigated trends in monthly seasonal and annual rainfall of orissa state in india using mann kendall sen s slope and linear regression tests the results of their analysis showed an insignificant negative trend in annual and monsoon rainfall but a positive trend in the post monsoon season also palizdan et al 2014 investigated seasonal and annual rainfall trends of the langat basin in malaysia they found a positive trend at all scales except in the inter monsoon and southwest monsoon season whereby negative trends were shown therefore the rainfall trend test is found to be none site specific and time bounded that calls for study at local scales a recently introduced approach by ≈üen 2012 called innovative trend analysis ita is used to analyze trends in hydrological meteorological and environmental variables ≈üen 2012 kisi and ay 2014 markus et al 2014 dabanlƒ± et al 2016 wu and hui qian 2017 zhou et al 2018 balasmeh et al 2019 kisi and ay 2014 analyzed the water quality parameters trend of the kizilirmak river in turkey using mk and ita methods the outcomes of the analysis revealed that the ita method could be used to investigate some trends which are not detected by the mann kendall test later dabanlƒ± et al 2016 used mk and ita methods to detect trends in hydro climatic data in the ergene river basin in turkey they stated that the ita approach yields trend classifications very low low medium high and very high which help in flood and drought studies in ethiopia numerous studies

2012 mekasha et al 2013 mengistu et al 2014 and degefu and bewket 2014 revealed that there were no clear rainfall trends in northern central southwestern and northwestern parts of the country perhaps trends in annual and seasonal rainfalls are mainly dependent on local scale climatic controls such as the topography of the areas mengistu et al 2014 the wabe shebelle basin is one of the major and sensitive river basins vulnerable to changes in rainfall and water resource variability in ethiopia while it has the largest area coverage its annual runoff and water availability are the lowest among the major wet river basins awass 2009 several studies were conducted in upper wabe shebelle river basin uwsrb the few available ones only covered small watershed and mainly focused on the land use land cover changes soil erosion runoff and sediment yield groundwater recharges groundwater potential zonation and water harvesting muleta et al 2006 alemayehu et al 2007 assen 2011 setegn et al 2011 senti et al 2014 megersa 2014 gebere et al 2016 woldemariam et al 2018 woldemariam and harka 2020 harka et al 2020 tolche 2021 in other words none of the past researches addressed analysis of spatiotemporal trend variability and spatial distribution of seasonal and annual rainfall using ita therefore analysis of rainfall trends and characteristics in the wabe shebele basin is indispensable to mitigate climate change related hazards and vulnerability besides it will help to predict future climate scenarios for proper planning of water resource developments and management that will guide future economic development the ita method mann kendall mk test and sen s slope estimator test methods used for this study would help us understand the rainfall trends as well as the rainfall variability which could affect the availability and sustainability of water resources that is why this study attempts 1 to explore the spatial distribution and variability of seasonal and annual rainfall in selected stations of uwsrb 2 to examine temporal trends and their spatial pattern of seasonal and annual rainfall using the mann kendall test mk sens s slope estimator and ita methods and 3 to compare the results of mk trend test and ita method 2 study area description and data sets 2 1 study area description the study was carried out in the uwsrb located in the south eastern part of ethiopia it lies between 6 87 n and 9 25 n latitudes and 38 45 e to 43 35 e longitude with an area of 62723 96 km2 fig 1 the uwsrb has diverse topographic features with elevation range between 394 m and 4191 m above mean sea level amsl in the highlands of the bale mountain fig 1 in this area the rainfall seasons are divided into three kiremt wet june july august september bega dry which is the dry season october november december january and belg transition the lesser comparing with kiremt february march april may seleshi and zanke 2004 segele et al 2008 romilly and gebremichael 2011 national meteorological agency nma 2014 bekele et al 2017a belihu et al 2017 mekonnen et al 2018 jilo et al 2019 2 2 rainfall dataset the rainfall data of uwsrb were collected from the national meteorology agency nma of ethiopia i e the sole climate data provider of the nation daily time series records of rainfall from 19 stations for 30 years i e the period of 1989 2018 were used the rainfall stations were selected based on the long term data record the low percentage of missing data and their representativeness to the sub basin all the data underwent rigorous data quality control accordingly the data was carefully checked for outliers and missing values which were filled by cross checking records from neighboring stations and standard statistical approaches 3 methodology different techniques were used to analyze data about trends and variability of rainfall over time series in order to compute rainfall variability coefficient of variation cv precipitation concentration index pci and standardized anomaly index sai were employed bewket and conway 2007 to assess the existence of trends in the data the innovative trend analysis ita technique mann kendall mk test and sen s slope estimator sse were used considering a 5 signiÔ¨Åcance level descriptions for all the methods are given in the following sub sections 3 1 methods for rainfall variability assessment 3 1 1 coefficient of variation cv the cv is used to assess the variability of annual and seasonal rainfall data a higher value of cv shows a larger variability of the rainfall time series data and was computed using the following formula 1 c v œÉ x 100 where œÉ is the standard deviation and x is the average rainfall data commonly the values of cv were classified as less cv 20 moderate 20 cv 30 high cv 30 and very high cv 40 hayelom et al 2017 asfaw et al 2018 3 1 2 the standardized anomaly index sai the sai is another method for rainfall variability assessment and is used to scrutinize the nature of the trends and to determine the dry and wet years in the record bekele et al 2017a 2017b it was calculated as 2 s a i z x Œº Œ¥ where x is the annual rainfall Œº is the mean annual rainfall for observation and Œ¥ is the standard deviation of annual rainfall throughout the observation the negative value of sai in eq 2 indicates a drought period as compared to the chosen reference period while the positive ones indicate a wet situation according to koudahe et al 2017 z value classiÔ¨Åcation are extremely wet z 2 very wet 1 9 z 1 5 moderately wet 1 49 z 1 0 near normal 0 99 z 0 99 moderately dry 1 0 z 1 49 severely dry 1 5 z 1 99 extremely dry z 2 3 1 3 precipitation concentration index pci pci was applied to evaluate the seasonality of rainfall it is an index used to show the distribution of monthly rainfall data and can also be used as an indicator of Ô¨Çoods and droughts gocic and trajkovic 2013 pci was computed using eq 3 de luis et al 2000 3 p c i i 1 12 p i 2 i 1 12 p i 2 100 where pi is the monthly rainfall amount in ith month as described by oliver 1980 pci values below 10 denote a uniform monthly rainfall distribution values ranging from 11 to 16 indicate a moderate concentration of rainfall values ranging from 16 to 20 indicate the irregular distribution of monthly rainfall and values of 20 and above represent a very high concentration of rainfall distribution 3 2 methods for rainfall trend detection 3 2 1 mann kendall test the nonparametric rank based mk test mann 1945 kendall 1975 has been widely applied for the detection of trends in hydro climatic time series data cailas et al 1986 yu et al 1993 gan 1998 zhang et al 2001 tesemma et al 2010 birara et al 2018 jilo et al 2019 it is applicable to detect non normally distributed data and is not sensitive to outliers hamed 2008 the test is applied by accepting or rejecting the null or alternative hypothesizes the null hypothesis h0 of the test assumes that the data are independent and identically distributed with no trend and the alternate hypothesis h1 is that there has been an increasing or decreasing trend in the series the test statistic s is given as follows 4 s i 1 n 1 j i 1 n s g n x j x i where n is the number of observations xi and xj are the ith and jth j i observations in the time series respectively and sgn xj xi is the sign function computed as 5 s g n x j x i 1 i f x j x i 0 0 i f x j x i 0 1 i f x i x j 0 the test statistic s is assumed for the series where sample size n 10 is asymptotically normally distributed with mean e s and variance var s as e s 0 and 6 v a r s n n 1 2 n 5 18 if there is a possibility of a tie in the value of x and when n is greater than 10 the distribution of statistics s tends to normality kendall 1975 therefore the variance is computed as 7 v a r s n n 1 2 n 5 k 1 m t k t k 1 2 t k 5 18 where m is the number of tied groups tk is the number of ties of extent k the standard normal test statistic z used for detecting a significant trend is expressed as 8 z s 1 v a r s i f s 0 0 i f s 0 s 1 v a r s i f s 0 in a two tailed test the null hypothesis of no trend should be accepted at the Œ± significance level for z1 Œ± 2 z z1 Œ± 2 where z1 Œ± 2 is the standard score z score of the standard normal distribution with the cumulative probability of 1 Œ± 2 otherwise the null hypothesis should be rejected and a monotonic trend has been identified at the Œ± significance level hence the positive and negative values of z show an upward and downward trend respectively 3 2 2 sen s slope estimator test sse the sse is a nonparametric approach that has been extensively used to estimate the slope of the trend in hydro climatic time series yue and hashino 2003 partal and kahya 2006 tabari and marofi 2011 the slope ti for all data pairs is calculated as sen 1968 9 f t q t b in eq 9 qt indicates slope while b is a constant to get the slope estimation q initially the slopes value of the entire time series data were calculated as shown in eq 10 10 q i x j x k j k where xj and xk are the values of data at times j and k j k respectively if there is only one datum in each period then n n n 1 2 where n is the number of periods if there are multiple observations in one or more periods then n n n 1 2 the n values of qi are ranked in ascending order and the median of slope or sen s slope estimator is given as 11 q m e d q n 1 2 i f n i s o d d q n 2 q n 2 2 2 i f n i s e v e n finally qmed has been calculated to obtain the trend and slope magnitude with the help of a non parametric model when qi is positive it implies means that there is an increasing trend while the negative value of qi reveals a decreasing or downward trend in time series analysis similarly a zero value represents no trend in the data the unit of resultant qi would be the magnitude of slope in original units per year or percent per year salmi et al 2002 3 2 3 innovative trend analysis ita method the ita method which was developed by ≈üen 2012 can be used for any time series data without limiting assumptions about hydro meteorological concepts this technique has been used around the globe cui et al 2017 murat and √∂zyildirim 2017 wu and hui qian 2017 gedefaw et al 2018 kisi et al 2018 ali et al 2019 malik et al 2019 wang et al 2020 yilmaz 2019 in the ita method the observed rainfall time series data has to be separated into two equal sections and arranged in ascending order hence in this study both sections are separately categorized in increasing order and plotted in the horizontal and vertical axis the first section of the time series xi i 1 2 3 n 2 is placed on horizontal x axis and the remaining section of time series xj j n 2 1 n 2 2 n is located on the vertical y axis on the cartesian coordinate system as presented in fig 2 for demonstration purpose the rainfall data points are plotted on 1 1 45 line on the coordinate if the point falls exactly on this line it indicates that there is no trend in the time series data if the rainfall data points fall above the 1 1 line it can be said that a monotonic increasing trend will occur while the rainfall data points below the 1 1 line indicate a monotonic decreasing trend in time series data ≈üen 2012 ≈üen 2014 similarly if the rainfall data points in a scatter plot fall above and below the 1 1 line it indicates the presence of non monotonic trend a non monotonic trend data can be separated into several clusters low medium and high the ranges of these low medium and high clusters can be classified either qualitatively according to expert judgement or quantitatively by dividing the domain of variation into classified sub groups dabanlƒ± et al 2016 wang et al 2020 as presented in fig 7 the classification of each group can be used by dividing the variable domain of the data into three equal intervals this classification is important to know the implication of flood high rainfall and drought low rainfall of the study √∂ztopal and ≈üen 2017 additionally low medium and high values of observed hydro meteorological data can be assessed graphically with the ita method dabanlƒ± et al 2016 √∂ztopal and ≈üen 2017 according to ≈üen 2017 the ita method at 1 5 and 10 significance levels were considered a good tool in understanding the hydro meteorological data in a time series analysis the straight line trend slope s is estimated using the following expression ≈üen 2017 12 s 2 x 2 x 1 n where s is the slope of the trend line x 1 and x 2 are the arithmetic mean of the first and the second half of the dependent variable and n is the total number of data used as shown in fig 2 the annual rainfall at hunte station was used as an application of the ita method therefore the following numerical values were used n 30 the arithmetic means from x 1 792 39 and x 2 660 36 finally using equation 12 s 2 660 36 792 39 30 8 80 insert fig 2 description of the ita method using sample station hunte station in uwsb here the trend slope line in eq 12 indicates that the stochastic characters of s are a function of the first and second half time series of arithmetic mean rainfall data values because x 1 and x 2 are also stochastic variables the expectation e s of the slope can be calculated by considering the expectations of both first and second half time series sides 13 e s 2 n e x 2 e x 1 if the values of e x 2 e x 1 therefore e s 0 and this implies there is no trend otherwise the difference between e x 2 a n d e x 1 gives the variance of the slope 14 œÉ s 2 e s 2 e 2 s 4 n 2 e x 2 2 e x 2 x 1 e x 1 2 as e x 2 2 e x 1 2 the above equation becomes 15 œÉ s 2 8 n 2 e x 2 e x 2 x 1 therefore the relationship is obtained as follows if x 2 œÉ x 1 œÉ n 16 œÉ s 2 8 n 2 œÉ 2 n 1 œÅ x 1 x 2 17 œÉ s 2 2 n n œÉ 1 œÅ x 1 x 2 where 18 œÅ x 1 x 2 e x 1 x 2 e x 1 e x 2 œÉ x 1 œÉ x 2 finally the confidence limit cl trend slope was calculated as 19 c l 1 Œ± 0 s c r i œÉ s where œÅ x 1 x 2 is the correlation coefficient between the two mean values in stochastic processes c l is the upper and lower confidence limits at the Œ± level of significance and œÉ s is the standard deviation the null hypothesis ho indicates that no trend in time series data and the alternate hypothesis h1 indicates that there is a trend in time series data observed thus in a two sided condition the ho and h1 are tested at Œ± 5 with z 1 96 if s cl 1 Œ± then ho is rejected and h1 is accepted the positive and negative value of s indicates a rising and falling trend in the time series data respectively ≈üen 2017 3 3 spatial distribution methods the inverse distance weighted idw and thiessen polygon tp methods were used to investigate the spatial distribution of annual and seasonal rainfall variability and trend analysis respectively the idw and tp are the most common deterministic interpolation methods both methods have been employed at varying spatial and temporal scales cheng et al 2017 in the present study 19 rainfall gauging stations were employed and the spatial distribution of gauging stations was determined using the idw for variability and tp method for trend analyses the overall the methodological flowchart of the study area is presented in fig 3 4 results and discussions 4 1 statistical analysis variability and spatial distributions of rainfall table 1 presents the statistical descriptive characters of mean annual and seasonal rainfall data in uwsrb the maximum and minimum mean annual rainfall is recorded in gelemso 1401 5 mm and fedis 425 4 mm stations respectively the mean annual rainfall in the area is 939 7 mm with a cv and a standard deviation of 27 4 and 257 5 mm respectively the spatial distribution of seasonal and annual rainfall for the period of 1989 2018 is depicted in fig 4 a d in annual period the maximum rainfall values were observed in the highland and northeastern parts of the uwsrb while the minimum were observed in the lowland and southeastern parts of uwsrb fig 4a during the kiremt season some parts of highland southern and northeastern showed high rainfall amounts whereas the smallest rainfall distribution was recorded in some parts of lowland and central areas of the uwsrb fig 4b for bega and belg seasons the maximum and minimum amounts of rainfall distributions were observed in the highland and lowland parts of the study area respectively fig 4c d therefore these results are in line with several studies applied in the country bayable et al 2021 gummadi et al 2017 birara et al 2018 alemu and bawoke 2019 they concluded that the maximum value of annual rainfall was observed in the high elevation areas whereas the minimum value of the rainfall in the lowest elevation areas overall parts of the study area which were affected by orographic barriers i e stations kofele arsi robe chole gelemso bedessa hirna jara bisidimo and deder were located near the elevated area in the catchment which receives higher amounts of rainfall in contrast to the stations at lower elevations such variations commonly reflect the dominance of orographic rainfall for the kiremt wet bega dry and belg transition seasons the mean annual rainfall cv were 527 3 33 9 123 0 76 6 and 305 7 44 0 respectively similar results were found by bewket and conway 2007 and ayalew et al 2012 where kiremt and belg seasons contributed the annual rainfall amount of 55 85 and 8 24 respectively in amhara regional state of ethiopia as depicted in table 1 the cv values of the stations in annual and seasonal rainfall are greater than 20 except arsi robe and kofele gauging stations which had low variations cv 20 in the annual series some stations showed moderate variation cv between 20 30 whereas six and two rainfall stations have relatively high and very high rainfall variability respectively for the kiremt and belg seasons the majority of stations show high and very high rainfall variables although in the bega season all stations presented very high cv values table 1 the output agrees with the result obtained by cheung et al 2008 where rainfall variability was above 20 throughout ethiopia indeed according to bekele et al 2017a 2017b most of the rainfall stations located in awash river basin showed moderate variation in annual and high variation in seasonal rainfall patterns moreover studies in the amhara region of ethiopia bewket and conway 2007 ayalew et al 2012 showed that most rainfall stations in the region exhibit a high cv during the kiremt season and very high variation during the bega and belg seasons overall higher rainfall variability of the study was presented in seasonal timescale than in the annual scale the spatial distribution of annual and seasonal cv is presented in fig 5 a d which exhibits a good relationship with the amount of rainfall distribution the correlation coefficients r between annual kiremt bega and belg cv values were 0 8 strong 0 2 weak and 0 51 moderate respectively according to li et al 2014 the absolute value of r between two variables is divided into a weak correlation 0 r 0 3 a low correlation 0 3 r 0 5 a moderate correlation 0 5 r 0 8 and a strong correlation 0 8 r 1 the variability of cv value is less than 20 in the highland and some northeastern parts of the study area during the annual and kiremt periods as shown in fig 5 a d most areas exhibit moderate variation in annual high and very high variation in seasonal periods for the bega season the cv value is greater than 40 in all areas of uwsrb fig 5c which indicates very high rainfall variability overall in annual and seasonal time series the cv values have relatively high variability in central and lowland areas of uwsrb which received a relatively minimal amount of rainfall distribution similar results are obtained by some studies across the region indeed bewket and conway 2007 birara et al 2018 bayable et al 2021 found out that the areas with high rainfall amounts exhibited low coefficient of variations in addition bega and kiremt seasons showed the highest and lowest cvs respectively this finding is consistent with seleshi and zanke 2004 bewket and conway 2007 bekele et al 2017a 2017b bayable et al 2021 they indicated that high and low cvs are observed for the dry and wet seasons respectively the spatial distribution of annual and seasonal pci values which were developed from the monthly rainfall data sets of each year from 1989 to 2018 are presented in fig 6 a d in the annual period the values of pci ranged from 10 4 18 8 and the minimum value of pci was prevalent in the highland northeastern eastern and southeastern parts of the study area as depicted in table 1 and fig 6 a the results of pci show a moderate concentration of monthly rainfall distribution in most gauging stations in the annual time series moreover in fig 6 b c and d the values of pci are greater than 20 which means very high concentration of monthly rainfall distribution likewise the pci values demonstrate a heterogeneous distribution of seasonal rainfall moreover in the bega and belg seasons the spatial distribution of pci value is greater than 30 in most parts of the uwsrb fig 6 c d which indicates a very uneven distribution of monthly rainfall lu et al 2019 uneven distribution of high rainfall concentration index was reported in the north central part of ethiopia asfaw et al 2018 furthermore in tana basin the rainfall variability accompanies an uneven distribution of rainfall patterns in annual and seasonal time series birara et al 2018 they also noted that during the bega and belg seasons the values of pci were higher than that of the kiremt season fig 7 a d depicts the spatial distribution of annual and seasonal sai values in the uwsrb as presented in fig 7 a 54 6 of negative anomalies was detected in the annual period moderate dry regions were in the highland and northeastern parts of the study areas while the eastern southeast and lowland parts of the study areas are classified under normal conditions sai is between 0 99 to 0 99 during the kiremt bega and belg seasons many parts of the uwsrb showed negative anomalies dry season the negative sai values of kiremt bega and belg seasons are 53 3 60 and 58 6 respectively for the kiremt season some parts of the highland and central areas of the study area are classified as relatively moderately dry fig 7b and for the bega and belg season the highland southeastern and northeastern parts of the study area have moderately dry classification fig 7 c d the probability of occurrence of dryness in the bega season has been found to be much more than those of belg and kiremt seasons the results of this study are supported by many of the previous research bekele et al 2017a 2017b birara et al 2018 alemu and bawoke 2019 these studies showed the value of sai which demonstrates the intensity and frequency of drought at various seasons investigation of the spatial distribution of annual and seasonal rainfall patterns can help to better identify dry and wet events overall the seasonal and annual rainfall variability was estimated by cv pci and sai techniques and they were of different behaviors for example the cv value indicates the variability of annual and seasonal rainfall and the area with low values of cv is prone to flooding whereas the area with a high value of cv is prone to drought asfaw et al 2018 alemu and bawoke 2019 pci indicated the seasonal variability of rainfall distribution and whenever the value is less than 10 it indicated uniform monthly rainfall distribution that could commonly be observed in the rain season however the maximum value of pci showed a very high irregular distribution of rainfall patterns and the area showed this in dry seasons asfaw et al 2018 the pci and sai can be used as an indicator of floods and droughts gocic and trajkovic 2013 koudahe et al 2017 the greatest value of rainfall variability affects water resources planning and management crop production soil fertility and food security bayable et al 2021 moreover the seasonal variability of rainfall has a great influence on the production of crops in the rain fed agricultural systems 4 2 temporal trend analysis by mann kendall and innovative trend analysis ita methods 4 2 1 annual trend analysis table 2 summarizes the results of positive increasing and negative decreasing trends in annual and seasonal rainfall stations the mean annual rainfall depicts a decreasing trend in eight out of the nineteen stations the significantly decreasing trends are detected at hunte hirna and bedessa stations while jara fedis bedenno girawa and gursum show significantly increasing trends at a 5 significance level in annual period eleven out of the nineteen rainfall stations showed statically non significant rising or declining trends sen s slope estimators for the annual rainfall are displayed in table 2 the magnitudes of positive and negative sen s slope estimator are recorded in eleven and eight rainfall stations respectively the maximum and minimum magnitude of sen s slope estimators of the annual rainfall were obtained in bedenno 18 9 mm year 1 and bedessa 29 3 mm year 1 stations these results agreed with the findings of mengistu and eyale 2011 who studied the southern rift valley of ethiopia where most annual rainfall stations showed an increasing trend alemu and bawoke 2019 also revealed that the annual rainfall showed an insignificant rising trend at a 10 significance level in the amhara region of ethiopia the results of ita method in low medium and high rainfall cluster for the annual rainfall is presented in fig 8 black green and red color points demonstrate the average central points of the low medium and high rainfall clusters fig 8 respectively and each rainfall cluster was estimated by eq 12 for example at hunte station low and medium rainfall cluster showed a decreasing trend while no trend in high rainfall was observed as all the scatter points fall almost on the 1 1 line while the negative slope of trend line was observed in low and medium rainfall clusters however most of the rainfall data points fall above the 1 1 45 line positive slope of the trend line fig 8 more than half of the rainfall stations showed non monotonic trend and they indicated different rainfall clusters fig 8 moreover monotonic increasing and decreasing trends were also observed see fig 8 for instance haramaya and bedessa stations showed monotonic increasing and decreasing trends respectively the findings of ita method for different rainfall clusters in the uwsrb are important as it offers in depth knowledge about water resources management and mitigation of flood and drought events accordingly the results of this study showed low medium and high rainfall clusters which is related to flood and drought events and most rainfall stations indicated positive increasing trend for medium and high rainfall clusters thus an investigation into low medium and high rainfall clusters is a very important issue in hydrological meteorological and climatological events murat and √∂zyildirim 2017 the results of this study are in line with many researchers findings e g ≈üen 2012 haktanir and citakoglu 2014 kisi 2015 wang et al 2020 4 2 2 seasonal rainfall the statistical results of the mk trend test and sen s slope estimators for the seasonal rainfall are given in table 2 from these results it can be understood that there is an increasing trend during the kiremt season in majority of the rainfall stations in the belg season only five rainfall stations displayed statistically significant trend as indicated in table 2 no significant trend was found in the bega season generally the finding of mk and sse indicate similar rainfall patterns and trends in the annual and kiremt season this similarity further indicates high contribution of kiremt rainfall to annual rainfall in all the stations in the uwsrb the correlation coefficient between mean annual and kiremt rainfall is 0 71 and it falls in the moderate correlation li et al 2014 moreover the major contribution of the kiremt rainfall to annual rainfall has been widely reported in various previous studies bewket and conway 2007 pingale et al 2014 bekele et al 2017a 2017b birara et al 2018 weldegerima et al 2017 in general these studies showed a kiremt season is the main contributor of to the annual rainfall in other parts of ethiopia furthermore the results of this study are similar to that of weldegerima et al 2017 who studied the lake tana sub basin of ethiopia wherein the values of mk trend tests of the kiremt season increased in large portion of the stations another report in awash river basin bekele et al 2017a showed an increasing trend likewise according to birara et al 2018 at a significant level of 5 and 10 most rainfall stations in tana basins were in a decreasing trend in the belg and bega seasons in addition non significant trend was noted for the bega and belg seasons in the lake tana sub basin throughout 1979 2015 weldegerima et al 2017 the cluster classification of the ita at each timescale is given in figs 9 and supplementary s2 and s3 for kiremt bega and belg seasons respectively for the period of 1989 2018 there was variations cluster classification in the ita method among the different seasons for the kiremt season eleven rainfall stations were detected to have increased tendencies for medium and high rainfall clusters as can be seen from fig 9 eight and six stations show increasing and decreasing low rainfall clusters respectively and no trend is indicated at low rainfall cluster in five of the stations for the bega season most of the rainfall stations displayed decreasing trend analysis for low and high rainfall clusters whereas for medium rainfall cluster slightly increasing and decreasing trends and trendless are observed supplementary s2 however during the belg season most stations revealed an increasing trend analysis for medium and high rainfall clusters supplementary s3 the temporal variations of rainfall clusters are more consistent for kiremt and belg seasons bega season shows the most decreasing trend analysis of rainfall clusters especially for low and high rainfall supplementary s2 generally in each timescale most rainfall stations showed non monotonic trend the variability of the rainfall clusters differs in each season for instance in the bega season results showed decreasing trend analysis for low and medium rainfall clusters it indicated that the variability of the rainfall clusters in the bega season is fairly decreasing trend therefore bega is the dry season of the country particularly in the study area seleshi and zanke 2004 segele et al 2008 national meteorological agency nma 2014 bekele et al 2017a 2017b belihu et al 2017 mekonnen et al 2018 jilo et al 2019 gurara et al 2021a if this trend continues in the future period it will highly influence the water resources potential of the area and hence the agriculture practices too in relation to this gurara et al 2021a reported a decreasing rainfall in bega season in the upper wabe bridge watershed a part of uwsrb increasing trend for the kiremt season may indicate the events of flood heavy rain appears in the kiremt season and the season is the most suitable for agricultural activities gurara et al 2021b this finding is important as it offers implications for water resources planning and management endeavors fig 10 depicts the temporal evaluation of sai in annual and seasonal rainfall which is compared with mk and ita methods findings in the annual time period eight and ten rainfall stations indicated positive and negative values of sai respectively although the results of the mk trend test eleven and eight rainfall stations showed increasing and decreasing trends respectively table 2 similarly in the ita method the majority of the stations show a slightly increasing trend analysis in annual timescale a large portion of the rainfall stations showed positive and negative values of sai mk and ita method during the kiremt and bega timescales respectively these results indicate that sai is in a good relation with mk and ita methods in the uwsrb further the relation among sai mk and ita is found to be in line with each other in most rainfall stations in addition the analysis of this relationship could be help more in understanding the temporal variability of rainfall which can have influence on wet and dry seasons of the study area the result of this study is in line with yilmaz 2019 similar results were obtained when we compared the outcomes the of sai mk and ita methods 4 3 spatial mapping of annual and seasonal rainfall trends by mk and ita methods the spatial distribution of the annual and seasonal rainfall trends was identified using the mk and ita methods figs 11 and 12 in the figures the big sky blue color represents a significant positive trend the ginger pink color represents a significant negative trend and the medium apple color shows a non significant trend in the mk trend test a large portion of the stations polygon showed non significant trend in annual kiremt and belg timescales as presented in fig 11 a b d and table 2 in the bega season all areas of tps showed a non significant trend at a 5 significance level fig 11 c however the spatial map of the ita method a large portion of the stations polygon showed significant positive trend in annual kiremt and belg timescales as presented in fig 12 a b d and tables 3 4 moreover in the bega season a significant positive and negative trend was found in five and nine stations polygons respectively while five rainfall stations showed non significant trend fig 12 c in both mk and ita methods the spatial map of annual and seasonal rainfall showed heterogeneity trend behavior in the area various studies were conducted throughout ethiopia on spatio temporal trend analysis of rainfall using parametric and non parametric methods e g wagesho et al 2013 gummadi et al 2017 alemu and bawoke 2019 spatial mapping of the results of trend analysis have been used to understand the impacts of global and regional climate change and climatic variability on the present and future water resources wagesho et al 2013 particularly the results of the present study agree with gummadi et al 2017 who argued that the trends observed in this area indicate substantial changes in amount and distribution of rainfall a large spatial temporal heterogeneity of trends over a large spatial area further affirms the robustness of the trends and even it may be a foundation for understanding the variability of climate and water resources in addition malik et al 2019 also noted that the spatial variability of rainfall trend is very important for impact assessment and adaptation planning for floods droughts and extreme events 4 4 comparison of trend analysis methods the findings of annual and seasonal rainfall using the mk trend test and ita method are summarized in table 5 in this study the total series of 76 annual and seasonal time series were analyzed using mk and ita methods at a 5 significance level with the mk test significant trends were detected in 23 time series in all timescales whereas the ita method showed 67 time series significant trends in all annual and seasonal timescales all the significant trends detected by the mk test were also identified by the ita technique however in the bega season 14 rainfall stations that were not detected by the mk trend test have been rather identified by the ita method hence the ita method is more appropriate to detect many hidden significant trends of rainfall which could otherwise not be identified by the mk method in the annual and seasonal rainfall series malik et al 2019 wang et al 2020 furthermore this finding promotes the credibility of the ita method this method classifies the results into low medium and high rainfall clusters hence this method is used for efficient and optimum management of water resources as it illuminates monotonic and non monotonic trends for a given time series ≈üen 2012 wang et al 2020 in addition ita techniques can deliver useful information and a priori view to the authorities and designers illustrating climate change scenarios kisi et al 2018 moreover as wang et al 2020 stated water authorities and risk managers can benefit comprehensive assessment by using ita compared with mk test ita method helps to identify the frequency of extreme events such as high values for floods and low values for droughts dabanlƒ± et al 2016 moreover the ita method is found to be more robust for trend analysis in time series data as it can be demonstrated graphically on the cartesian coordinate system in order to provide a clear visual display for further clarification it is a visual graphical method and provides an assessment of trends in different groups this idea was supported by ≈üen 2017 furthermore the ita method is relatively simple to comprehend and perform analysis in addition the ita method does not depend on different assumptions serial correlation and seasonal cycle cui et al 2017 ≈üen 2017 zhou et al 2018 5 conclusions this study focused on an investigation of the spatial distribution and temporal rainfall variability and trend analysis in the uwsrb it assumed that this is vital for understanding the impacts of climate on the environment as it illuminates the events of floods and droughts thus in the study the temporal and spatial rainfall variability was analyzed by cv pci and sai and trend analysis was tested using the mk test sse and the ita method with low medium and high rainfall clusters both for annual and seasonal rainfall the study collected and analyzed data over the time period of 1989 2018 in the uwsrb during this investigation the mean annual rainfall was 939 7 mm with a cv of 27 4 and an sd of 257 5 mm the spatial distribution of seasonal and annual rainfall was found to be heterogeneous in uwsrb during annual and kiremt rainfall the cv showed moderate and high variability over the study area respectively however very high and above limit variation was observed in the bega and belg season rainfall this shows a good relationship between the amount of rainfall distributions in the study area the results of pci were more pronounced in the highland and northeastern parts of the study area in both annual and seasonal time series whereas the monthly rainfall in other parts of the area was extremely uneven distribution with a high concentration and volatility the negative sai values of annual kiremt bega and belg seasons were 54 6 53 3 60 and 58 6 respectively the findings disclosed that most parts of the study area showed negative anomalies dry season the spatial distribution of sai in uwsrb was noticed to have experienced variability in drier and wetter years over the study period the temporal values of the mk trend test depicted that there was a more non significant trend in mean annual rainfall except in hunte hirna jara fedis bedessa bedenno girawa and gursum stations which had significant trends at a 5 level the highest and lowest magnitude of sse of annual rainfall was observed at bedenno and bedessa stations respectively during the kiremt and bega seasons the outcomes of the mk trend test and sse demonstrated upward and downward trends in most rainfall stations respectively moreover for the belg season more than half of the stations had an increasing trend the significant trends of seasonal rainfall were detected at ten stations in kiremt and five stations in belg however in the bega season statistically non significant increasing and decreasing trends were detected in all of the rainfall stations furthermore the findings of the ita method in annual rainfall stations fall above and below 1 1 45o line and all the rainfall stations were significant at a 5 level for annual time period several stations showed a non monotonic trend while haramaya and bedessa stations showed monotonic increasing and decreasing trends respectively in annual and kiremt time period most rainfall stations presented high rainfall clusters and showed increasing trends while low rainfall appeared in bega season mainly exhibiting decreasing trends these results indicate that the probability of occurrence of high flood risk would be in kiremt whereas drought events would appear in bega season for the uwsrb furthermore the spatial mapping of annual and seasonal events by using the ita method showed that most of the annual rainfall stations have significantly increasing trends for the kiremt and belg seasons most rainfall stations have insignificantly increasing trends while in the bega season most of the stations exhibit decreasing trends as found out with the use of the ita method in the kiremt season all rainfall stations were statically significant at the 5 level however in both bega and belg seasons few stations revealed a non significant trend line in this study the results of the mk test and ita method are in complete agreement with trend tests in both annual and seasonal time series all the significant trends analyzed by the mk test were also detected by using the ita method at a 5 significance level however in bega season the significant trend could not be identified by the mk trend test while it was possible to identify it using the ita approach this showed that the ita method is more robust in detecting many hidden significant trends of rainfall which could not otherwise be identified by the mk trend test also the mk trend test was applied for monotonic trend analysis with time series data however the ita method provided low medium and high rainfall clusters for analysis of monotonic and non monotonic trend examination moreover low medium and high rainfall clusters indicate the possibilities of droughts and floods respectively therefore the results of this study are helpful for water resources planning and management for analysis and managing of the impacts of some hazards such as floods and drought further research might reveal the application and implications of this study in other river basins in ethiopian 6 author statement arus edo harka conceptualization methodology writing review editing

8163,study region upper wabe shebelle river basin uwsrb ethiopia study focus this study investigated the spatio temporal patterns or trends and spatial distribution and variability of rainfall in seasonal and annual time series the rainfall variability was evaluated by the coefÔ¨Åcient of variation cv precipitation concentration index pci and standardized anomaly index sai the spatio temporal trends were also analyzed using the mann kendall test mk sen s slope estimators sse and the latest technique of innovative trend analysis ita method was used for analyzing the low medium and high rainfall clusters new hydrological insight for the region in most of the rainfall stations high amount of annual rainfall happened in the kiremt wet season and high rainfall variability was during the bega dry season during the annual rainfall the mk test and sse were statistically non significant in some stations and heavy rainfall was detected in the kiremt and belg transition seasons for the kiremt and annual period most rainfall stations showed high rainfall cluster and increasing trends while low rainfall was observed in bega season which exhibited decreasing trends the outcomes of comparison revealed that the ita method is more robust and surpassed the mk test as it could detect monotonic and non monotonic trends that cannot be observed by the mk method the result of this study

introduction increment in greenhouse gas concentration in the atmosphere is anticipated to be the major reason for climate change ipcc 2014 climate change is an increasing due to global warming and has a substantial impact not only on the functioning of our ecosystem but also on our socio economic development in today s world ipcc 2013 chang et al 2019 in sub saharan africa the long term change of climate associated with changes in precipitation patterns and variability and in the temperature is highly likely to raise the frequency of Ô¨Çoods and droughts ipcc et al 2012 in ethiopia agriculture is the dominant sector of the economy however it is highly vulnerable to climate shocks attributed to extremes such as drought and flood events world bank 2010 for example over the past decade rainfall anomalies indicate extreme wet periods in 1962 1966 1979 1998 99 and 2006 07 and extreme dry periods in years 1971 1973 1984 1986 1992 and 2002 2004 this variability of rainfall greatly affected the agricultural productivity pastoralists and animals seleshi and zanke 2004 therefore analyzing the spatio temporal distribution of rainfall and detecting trends is the key to sustaining agricultural production and healthy ecosystem functions krishan et al 2013 worku et al 2018 one of the noticeable impacts of climate change is variations in the processes and storages components of the hydrologic cycle wang et al 2020 rainfall being one of the core constituents processes in the hydrological cycle varies in spatial and temporal patterns due to the increase in the concentration of atmospheric gases wang et al 2020 an investigation into temporal trends and spatial distribution of rainfall is thus vital for sustainable water resource utilization and control of droughts and floods likewise a clear understanding of the spatio temporal distribution of precipitation is a one to model flood regulating structures such as detention dam and surface water storage brunsell et al 2010 bellu et al 2016 ter√™ncio et al 2018 therefore analyzing variations in rainfall patterns and possible trends in temporal and at spatial scales in such areas as upper wabe shebelle river basin is essential in setting possible mitigation measures and assessing ecosystem resilience vis √† vis flood and drought events in the past few decades several approaches have been developed to analyze the trend of rainfall using either non parametric or parametric methods such as the mann kendall test sen s slope spearman s rho test cumulative sum and linear regression karpouzos et al 2010 piao et al 2010 gocic and trajkovic 2013 westra et al 2013 pingale et al 2014 among these the mann kendall mk trend test method is the most commonly used technique wang et al 2020 seifu and abdulkarim 2006 employed the mk test to analyze the rainfall trend in ethiopia the results of their finding indicate that belg transition rainfall season does not show a significant trend while kiremt wet rainfall season shows a significant decreasing trend during the period of 1973 2002 westra et al 2013 analyzed monotonic trends in annual maximum daily precipitation globally by applying the mann kendall test spearman s rho test and linear regression the findings showed statistically signiÔ¨Åcant increasing trends at the global scale close to two thirds of the stations showed increases over the period 1900 2009 gemmer et al 2011 applied the mann kendall test to investigate rainfall trends in the zhujiang basin their finding indicated that few of the stations under their study resulted trends in the precipitation indices on annual basis patra et al 2012 investigated trends in monthly seasonal and annual rainfall of orissa state in india using mann kendall sen s slope and linear regression tests the results of their analysis showed an insignificant negative trend in annual and monsoon rainfall but a positive trend in the post monsoon season also palizdan et al 2014 investigated seasonal and annual rainfall trends of the langat basin in malaysia they found a positive trend at all scales except in the inter monsoon and southwest monsoon season whereby negative trends were shown therefore the rainfall trend test is found to be none site specific and time bounded that calls for study at local scales a recently introduced approach by ≈üen 2012 called innovative trend analysis ita is used to analyze trends in hydrological meteorological and environmental variables ≈üen 2012 kisi and ay 2014 markus et al 2014 dabanlƒ± et al 2016 wu and hui qian 2017 zhou et al 2018 balasmeh et al 2019 kisi and ay 2014 analyzed the water quality parameters trend of the kizilirmak river in turkey using mk and ita methods the outcomes of the analysis revealed that the ita method could be used to investigate some trends which are not detected by the mann kendall test later dabanlƒ± et al 2016 used mk and ita methods to detect trends in hydro climatic data in the ergene river basin in turkey they stated that the ita approach yields trend classifications very low low medium high and very high which help in flood and drought studies in ethiopia numerous studies have been conducted on rainfall trends and variability covering different spatial and temporal scales e g osman and sauerborn 2002 conway et al 2004 seleshi and zanke 2004 seifu and abdulkarim 2006 bewket and conway 2007 national meteorological agency nma 2007 cheung et al 2008 ayalew et al 2012 mengistu et al 2014 wagesho et al 2013 daniel et al 2014 degefu and bewket 2014 tabari et al 2015 gebremedhin et al 2016 most of these studies showed that the rainfall trends were mixed different places for instance studies conducted by national meteorological agency nma 2001 2007 seleshi and zanke 2004 verdin et al 2005 kebede 2013 and wagesho et al 2013 showed declining trends in annual and seasonal rainfall in the northern southern eastern central northeastern northwestern and southwestern region of the country however conway et al 2004 meze hausken 2004 seleshi and zanke 2004 verdin et al 2005 seleshi and camberlin 2006 bewket and conway 2007 cheung et al 2008 ayalew et al 2012 mekasha et al 2013 mengistu et al 2014 and degefu and bewket 2014 revealed that there were no clear rainfall trends in northern central southwestern and northwestern parts of the country perhaps trends in annual and seasonal rainfalls are mainly dependent on local scale climatic controls such as the topography of the areas mengistu et al 2014 the wabe shebelle basin is one of the major and sensitive river basins vulnerable to changes in rainfall and water resource variability in ethiopia while it has the largest area coverage its annual runoff and water availability are the lowest among the major wet river basins awass 2009 several studies were conducted in upper wabe shebelle river basin uwsrb the few available ones only covered small watershed and mainly focused on the land use land cover changes soil erosion runoff and sediment yield groundwater recharges groundwater potential zonation and water harvesting muleta et al 2006 alemayehu et al 2007 assen 2011 setegn et al 2011 senti et al 2014 megersa 2014 gebere et al 2016 woldemariam et al 2018 woldemariam and harka 2020 harka et al 2020 tolche 2021 in other words none of the past researches addressed analysis of spatiotemporal trend variability and spatial distribution of seasonal and annual rainfall using ita therefore analysis of rainfall trends and characteristics in the wabe shebele basin is indispensable to mitigate climate change related hazards and vulnerability besides it will help to predict future climate scenarios for proper planning of water resource developments and management that will guide future economic development the ita method mann kendall mk test and sen s slope estimator test methods used for this study would help us understand the rainfall trends as well as the rainfall variability which could affect the availability and sustainability of water resources that is why this study attempts 1 to explore the spatial distribution and variability of seasonal and annual rainfall in selected stations of uwsrb 2 to examine temporal trends and their spatial pattern of seasonal and annual rainfall using the mann kendall test mk sens s slope estimator and ita methods and 3 to compare the results of mk trend test and ita method 2 study area description and data sets 2 1 study area description the study was carried out in the uwsrb located in the south eastern part of ethiopia it lies between 6 87 n and 9 25 n latitudes and 38 45 e to 43 35 e longitude with an area of 62723 96 km2 fig 1 the uwsrb has diverse topographic features with elevation range between 394 m and 4191 m above mean sea level amsl in the highlands of the bale mountain fig 1 in this area the rainfall seasons are divided into three kiremt wet june july august september bega dry which is the dry season october november december january and belg transition the lesser comparing with kiremt february march april may seleshi and zanke 2004 segele et al 2008 romilly and gebremichael 2011 national meteorological agency nma 2014 bekele et al 2017a belihu et al 2017 mekonnen et al 2018 jilo et al 2019 2 2 rainfall dataset the rainfall data of uwsrb were collected from the national meteorology agency nma of ethiopia i e the sole climate data provider of the nation daily time series records of rainfall from 19 stations for 30 years i e the period of 1989 2018 were used the rainfall stations were selected based on the long term data record the low percentage of missing data and their representativeness to the sub basin all the data underwent rigorous data quality control accordingly the data was carefully checked for outliers and missing values which were filled by cross checking records from neighboring stations and standard statistical approaches 3 methodology different techniques were used to analyze data about trends and variability of rainfall over time series in order to compute rainfall variability coefficient of variation cv precipitation concentration index pci and standardized anomaly index sai were employed bewket and conway 2007 to assess the existence of trends in the data the innovative trend analysis ita technique mann kendall mk test and sen s slope estimator sse were used considering a 5 signiÔ¨Åcance level descriptions for all the methods are given in the following sub sections 3 1 methods for rainfall variability assessment 3 1 1 coefficient of variation cv the cv is used to assess the variability of annual and seasonal rainfall data a higher value of cv shows a larger variability of the rainfall time series data and was computed using the following formula 1 c v œÉ x 100 where œÉ is the standard deviation and x is the average rainfall data commonly the values of cv were classified as less cv 20 moderate 20 cv 30 high cv 30 and very high cv 40 hayelom et al 2017 asfaw et al 2018 3 1 2 the standardized anomaly index sai the sai is another method for rainfall variability assessment and is used to scrutinize the nature of the trends and to determine the dry and wet years in the record bekele et al 2017a 2017b it was calculated as 2 s a i z x Œº Œ¥ where x is the annual rainfall Œº is the mean annual rainfall for observation and Œ¥ is the standard deviation of annual rainfall throughout the observation the negative value of sai in eq 2 indicates a drought period as compared to the chosen reference period while the positive ones indicate a wet situation according to koudahe et al 2017 z value classiÔ¨Åcation are extremely wet z 2 very wet 1 9 z 1 5 moderately wet 1 49 z 1 0 near normal 0 99 z 0 99 moderately dry 1 0 z 1 49 severely dry 1 5 z 1 99 extremely dry z 2 3 1 3 precipitation concentration index pci pci was applied to evaluate the seasonality of rainfall it is an index used to show the distribution of monthly rainfall data and can also be used as an indicator of Ô¨Çoods and droughts gocic and trajkovic 2013 pci was computed using eq 3 de luis et al 2000 3 p c i i 1 12 p i 2 i 1 12 p i 2 100 where pi is the monthly rainfall amount in ith month as described by oliver 1980 pci values below 10 denote a uniform monthly rainfall distribution values ranging from 11 to 16 indicate a moderate concentration of rainfall values ranging from 16 to 20 indicate the irregular distribution of monthly rainfall and values of 20 and above represent a very high concentration of rainfall distribution 3 2 methods for rainfall trend detection 3 2 1 mann kendall test the nonparametric rank based mk test mann 1945 kendall 1975 has been widely applied for the detection of trends in hydro climatic time series data cailas et al 1986 yu et al 1993 gan 1998 zhang et al 2001 tesemma et al 2010 birara et al 2018 jilo et al 2019 it is applicable to detect non normally distributed data and is not sensitive to outliers hamed 2008 the test is applied by accepting or rejecting the null or alternative hypothesizes the null hypothesis h0 of the test assumes that the data are independent and identically distributed with no trend and the alternate hypothesis h1 is that there has been an increasing or decreasing trend in the series the test statistic s is given as follows 4 s i 1 n 1 j i 1 n s g n x j x i where n is the number of observations xi and xj are the ith and jth j i observations in the time series respectively and sgn xj xi is the sign function computed as 5 s g n x j x i 1 i f x j x i 0 0 i f x j x i 0 1 i f x i x j 0 the test statistic s is assumed for the series where sample size n 10 is asymptotically normally distributed with mean e s and variance var s as e s 0 and 6 v a r s n n 1 2 n 5 18 if there is a possibility of a tie in the value of x and when n is greater than 10 the distribution of statistics s tends to normality kendall 1975 therefore the variance is computed as 7 v a r s n n 1 2 n 5 k 1 m t k t k 1 2 t k 5 18 where m is the number of tied groups tk is the number of ties of extent k the standard normal test statistic z used for detecting a significant trend is expressed as 8 z s 1 v a r s i f s 0 0 i f s 0 s 1 v a r s i f s 0 in a two tailed test the null hypothesis of no trend should be accepted at the Œ± significance level for z1 Œ± 2 z z1 Œ± 2 where z1 Œ± 2 is the standard score z score of the standard normal distribution with the cumulative probability of 1 Œ± 2 otherwise the null hypothesis should be rejected and a monotonic trend has been identified at the Œ± significance level hence the positive and negative values of z show an upward and downward trend respectively 3 2 2 sen s slope estimator test sse the sse is a nonparametric approach that has been extensively used to estimate the slope of the trend in hydro climatic time series yue and hashino 2003 partal and kahya 2006 tabari and marofi 2011 the slope ti for all data pairs is calculated as sen 1968 9 f t q t b in eq 9 qt indicates slope while b is a constant to get the slope estimation q initially the slopes value of the entire time series data were calculated as shown in eq 10 10 q i x j x k j k where xj and xk are the values of data at times j and k j k respectively if there is only one datum in each period then n n n 1 2 where n is the number of periods if there are multiple observations in one or more periods then n n n 1 2 the n values of qi are ranked in ascending order and the median of slope or sen s slope estimator is given as 11 q m e d q n 1 2 i f n i s o d d q n 2 q n 2 2 2 i f n i s e v e n finally qmed has been calculated to obtain the trend and slope magnitude with the help of a non parametric model when qi is positive it implies means that there is an increasing trend while the negative value of qi reveals a decreasing or downward trend in time series analysis similarly a zero value represents no trend in the data the unit of resultant qi would be the magnitude of slope in original units per year or percent per year salmi et al 2002 3 2 3 innovative trend analysis ita method the ita method which was developed by ≈üen 2012 can be used for any time series data without limiting assumptions about hydro meteorological concepts this technique has been used around the globe cui et al 2017 murat and √∂zyildirim 2017 wu and hui qian 2017 gedefaw et al 2018 kisi et al 2018 ali et al 2019 malik et al 2019 wang et al 2020 yilmaz 2019 in the ita method the observed rainfall time series data has to be separated into two equal sections and arranged in ascending order hence in this study both sections are separately categorized in increasing order and plotted in the horizontal and vertical axis the first section of the time series xi i 1 2 3 n 2 is placed on horizontal x axis and the remaining section of time series xj j n 2 1 n 2 2 n is located on the vertical y axis on the cartesian coordinate system as presented in fig 2 for demonstration purpose the rainfall data points are plotted on 1 1 45 line on the coordinate if the point falls exactly on this line it indicates that there is no trend in the time series data if the rainfall data points fall above the 1 1 line it can be said that a monotonic increasing trend will occur while the rainfall data points below the 1 1 line indicate a monotonic decreasing trend in time series data ≈üen 2012 ≈üen 2014 similarly if the rainfall data points in a scatter plot fall above and below the 1 1 line it indicates the presence of non monotonic trend a non monotonic trend data can be separated into several clusters low medium and high the ranges of these low medium and high clusters can be classified either qualitatively according to expert judgement or quantitatively by dividing the domain of variation into classified sub groups dabanlƒ± et al 2016 wang et al 2020 as presented in fig 7 the classification of each group can be used by dividing the variable domain of the data into three equal intervals this classification is important to know the implication of flood high rainfall and drought low rainfall of the study √∂ztopal and ≈üen 2017 additionally low medium and high values of observed hydro meteorological data can be assessed graphically with the ita method dabanlƒ± et al 2016 √∂ztopal and ≈üen 2017 according to ≈üen 2017 the ita method at 1 5 and 10 significance levels were considered a good tool in understanding the hydro meteorological data in a time series analysis the straight line trend slope s is estimated using the following expression ≈üen 2017 12 s 2 x 2 x 1 n where s is the slope of the trend line x 1 and x 2 are the arithmetic mean of the first and the second half of the dependent variable and n is the total number of data used as shown in fig 2 the annual rainfall at hunte station was used as an application of the ita method therefore the following numerical values were used n 30 the arithmetic means from x 1 792 39 and x 2 660 36 finally using equation 12 s 2 660 36 792 39 30 8 80 insert fig 2 description of the ita method using sample station hunte station in uwsb here the trend slope line in eq 12 indicates that the stochastic characters of s are a function of the first and second half time series of arithmetic mean rainfall data values because x 1 and x 2 are also stochastic variables the expectation e s of the slope can be calculated by considering the expectations of both first and second half time series sides 13 e s 2 n e x 2 e x 1 if the values of e x 2 e x 1 therefore e s 0 and this implies there is no trend otherwise the difference between e x 2 a n d e x 1 gives the variance of the slope 14 œÉ s 2 e s 2 e 2 s 4 n 2 e x 2 2 e x 2 x 1 e x 1 2 as e x 2 2 e x 1 2 the above equation becomes 15 œÉ s 2 8 n 2 e x 2 e x 2 x 1 therefore the relationship is obtained as follows if x 2 œÉ x 1 œÉ n 16 œÉ s 2 8 n 2 œÉ 2 n 1 œÅ x 1 x 2 17 œÉ s 2 2 n n œÉ 1 œÅ x 1 x 2 where 18 œÅ x 1 x 2 e x 1 x 2 e x 1 e x 2 œÉ x 1 œÉ x 2 finally the confidence limit cl trend slope was calculated as 19 c l 1 Œ± 0 s c r i œÉ s where œÅ x 1 x 2 is the correlation coefficient between the two mean values in stochastic processes c l is the upper and lower confidence limits at the Œ± level of significance and œÉ s is the standard deviation the null hypothesis ho indicates that no trend in time series data and the alternate hypothesis h1 indicates that there is a trend in time series data observed thus in a two sided condition the ho and h1 are tested at Œ± 5 with z 1 96 if s cl 1 Œ± then ho is rejected and h1 is accepted the positive and negative value of s indicates a rising and falling trend in the time series data respectively ≈üen 2017 3 3 spatial distribution methods the inverse distance weighted idw and thiessen polygon tp methods were used to investigate the spatial distribution of annual and seasonal rainfall variability and trend analysis respectively the idw and tp are the most common deterministic interpolation methods both methods have been employed at varying spatial and temporal scales cheng et al 2017 in the present study 19 rainfall gauging stations were employed and the spatial distribution of gauging stations was determined using the idw for variability and tp method for trend analyses the overall the methodological flowchart of the study area is presented in fig 3 4 results and discussions 4 1 statistical analysis variability and spatial distributions of rainfall table 1 presents the statistical descriptive characters of mean annual and seasonal rainfall data in uwsrb the maximum and minimum mean annual rainfall is recorded in gelemso 1401 5 mm and fedis 425 4 mm stations respectively the mean annual rainfall in the area is 939 7 mm with a cv and a standard deviation of 27 4 and 257 5 mm respectively the spatial distribution of seasonal and annual rainfall for the period of 1989 2018 is depicted in fig 4 a d in annual period the maximum rainfall values were observed in the highland and northeastern parts of the uwsrb while the minimum were observed in the lowland and southeastern parts of uwsrb fig 4a during the kiremt season some parts of highland southern and northeastern showed high rainfall amounts whereas the smallest rainfall distribution was recorded in some parts of lowland and central areas of the uwsrb fig 4b for bega and belg seasons the maximum and minimum amounts of rainfall distributions were observed in the highland and lowland parts of the study area respectively fig 4c d therefore these results are in line with several studies applied in the country bayable et al 2021 gummadi et al 2017 birara et al 2018 alemu and bawoke 2019 they concluded that the maximum value of annual rainfall was observed in the high elevation areas whereas the minimum value of the rainfall in the lowest elevation areas overall parts of the study area which were affected by orographic barriers i e stations kofele arsi robe chole gelemso bedessa hirna jara bisidimo and deder were located near the elevated area in the catchment which receives higher amounts of rainfall in contrast to the stations at lower elevations such variations commonly reflect the dominance of orographic rainfall for the kiremt wet bega dry and belg transition seasons the mean annual rainfall cv were 527 3 33 9 123 0 76 6 and 305 7 44 0 respectively similar results were found by bewket and conway 2007 and ayalew et al 2012 where kiremt and belg seasons contributed the annual rainfall amount of 55 85 and 8 24 respectively in amhara regional state of ethiopia as depicted in table 1 the cv values of the stations in annual and seasonal rainfall are greater than 20 except arsi robe and kofele gauging stations which had low variations cv 20 in the annual series some stations showed moderate variation cv between 20 30 whereas six and two rainfall stations have relatively high and very high rainfall variability respectively for the kiremt and belg seasons the majority of stations show high and very high rainfall variables although in the bega season all stations presented very high cv values table 1 the output agrees with the result obtained by cheung et al 2008 where rainfall variability was above 20 throughout ethiopia indeed according to bekele et al 2017a 2017b most of the rainfall stations located in awash river basin showed moderate variation in annual and high variation in seasonal rainfall patterns moreover studies in the amhara region of ethiopia bewket and conway 2007 ayalew et al 2012 showed that most rainfall stations in the region exhibit a high cv during the kiremt season and very high variation during the bega and belg seasons overall higher rainfall variability of the study was presented in seasonal timescale than in the annual scale the spatial distribution of annual and seasonal cv is presented in fig 5 a d which exhibits a good relationship with the amount of rainfall distribution the correlation coefficients r between annual kiremt bega and belg cv values were 0 8 strong 0 2 weak and 0 51 moderate respectively according to li et al 2014 the absolute value of r between two variables is divided into a weak correlation 0 r 0 3 a low correlation 0 3 r 0 5 a moderate correlation 0 5 r 0 8 and a strong correlation 0 8 r 1 the variability of cv value is less than 20 in the highland and some northeastern parts of the study area during the annual and kiremt periods as shown in fig 5 a d most areas exhibit moderate variation in annual high and very high variation in seasonal periods for the bega season the cv value is greater than 40 in all areas of uwsrb fig 5c which indicates very high rainfall variability overall in annual and seasonal time series the cv values have relatively high variability in central and lowland areas of uwsrb which received a relatively minimal amount of rainfall distribution similar results are obtained by some studies across the region indeed bewket and conway 2007 birara et al 2018 bayable et al 2021 found out that the areas with high rainfall amounts exhibited low coefficient of variations in addition bega and kiremt seasons showed the highest and lowest cvs respectively this finding is consistent with seleshi and zanke 2004 bewket and conway 2007 bekele et al 2017a 2017b bayable et al 2021 they indicated that high and low cvs are observed for the dry and wet seasons respectively the spatial distribution of annual and seasonal pci values which were developed from the monthly rainfall data sets of each year from 1989 to 2018 are presented in fig 6 a d in the annual period the values of pci ranged from 10 4 18 8 and the minimum value of pci was prevalent in the highland northeastern eastern and southeastern parts of the study area as depicted in table 1 and fig 6 a the results of pci show a moderate concentration of monthly rainfall distribution in most gauging stations in the annual time series moreover in fig 6 b c and d the values of pci are greater than 20 which means very high concentration of monthly rainfall distribution likewise the pci values demonstrate a heterogeneous distribution of seasonal rainfall moreover in the bega and belg seasons the spatial distribution of pci value is greater than 30 in most parts of the uwsrb fig 6 c d which indicates a very uneven distribution of monthly rainfall lu et al 2019 uneven distribution of high rainfall concentration index was reported in the north central part of ethiopia asfaw et al 2018 furthermore in tana basin the rainfall variability accompanies an uneven distribution of rainfall patterns in annual and seasonal time series birara et al 2018 they also noted that during the bega and belg seasons the values of pci were higher than that of the kiremt season fig 7 a d depicts the spatial distribution of annual and seasonal sai values in the uwsrb as presented in fig 7 a 54 6 of negative anomalies was detected in the annual period moderate dry regions were in the highland and northeastern parts of the study areas while the eastern southeast and lowland parts of the study areas are classified under normal conditions sai is between 0 99 to 0 99 during the kiremt bega and belg seasons many parts of the uwsrb showed negative anomalies dry season the negative sai values of kiremt bega and belg seasons are 53 3 60 and 58 6 respectively for the kiremt season some parts of the highland and central areas of the study area are classified as relatively moderately dry fig 7b and for the bega and belg season the highland southeastern and northeastern parts of the study area have moderately dry classification fig 7 c d the probability of occurrence of dryness in the bega season has been found to be much more than those of belg and kiremt seasons the results of this study are supported by many of the previous research bekele et al 2017a 2017b birara et al 2018 alemu and bawoke 2019 these studies showed the value of sai which demonstrates the intensity and frequency of drought at various seasons investigation of the spatial distribution of annual and seasonal rainfall patterns can help to better identify dry and wet events overall the seasonal and annual rainfall variability was estimated by cv pci and sai techniques and they were of different behaviors for example the cv value indicates the variability of annual and seasonal rainfall and the area with low values of cv is prone to flooding whereas the area with a high value of cv is prone to drought asfaw et al 2018 alemu and bawoke 2019 pci indicated the seasonal variability of rainfall distribution and whenever the value is less than 10 it indicated uniform monthly rainfall distribution that could commonly be observed in the rain season however the maximum value of pci showed a very high irregular distribution of rainfall patterns and the area showed this in dry seasons asfaw et al 2018 the pci and sai can be used as an indicator of floods and droughts gocic and trajkovic 2013 koudahe et al 2017 the greatest value of rainfall variability affects water resources planning and management crop production soil fertility and food security bayable et al 2021 moreover the seasonal variability of rainfall has a great influence on the production of crops in the rain fed agricultural systems 4 2 temporal trend analysis by mann kendall and innovative trend analysis ita methods 4 2 1 annual trend analysis table 2 summarizes the results of positive increasing and negative decreasing trends in annual and seasonal rainfall stations the mean annual rainfall depicts a decreasing trend in eight out of the nineteen stations the significantly decreasing trends are detected at hunte hirna and bedessa stations while jara fedis bedenno girawa and gursum show significantly increasing trends at a 5 significance level in annual period eleven out of the nineteen rainfall stations showed statically non significant rising or declining trends sen s slope estimators for the annual rainfall are displayed in table 2 the magnitudes of positive and negative sen s slope estimator are recorded in eleven and eight rainfall stations respectively the maximum and minimum magnitude of sen s slope estimators of the annual rainfall were obtained in bedenno 18 9 mm year 1 and bedessa 29 3 mm year 1 stations these results agreed with the findings of mengistu and eyale 2011 who studied the southern rift valley of ethiopia where most annual rainfall stations showed an increasing trend alemu and bawoke 2019 also revealed that the annual rainfall showed an insignificant rising trend at a 10 significance level in the amhara region of ethiopia the results of ita method in low medium and high rainfall cluster for the annual rainfall is presented in fig 8 black green and red color points demonstrate the average central points of the low medium and high rainfall clusters fig 8 respectively and each rainfall cluster was estimated by eq 12 for example at hunte station low and medium rainfall cluster showed a decreasing trend while no trend in high rainfall was observed as all the scatter points fall almost on the 1 1 line while the negative slope of trend line was observed in low and medium rainfall clusters however most of the rainfall data points fall above the 1 1 45 line positive slope of the trend line fig 8 more than half of the rainfall stations showed non monotonic trend and they indicated different rainfall clusters fig 8 moreover monotonic increasing and decreasing trends were also observed see fig 8 for instance haramaya and bedessa stations showed monotonic increasing and decreasing trends respectively the findings of ita method for different rainfall clusters in the uwsrb are important as it offers in depth knowledge about water resources management and mitigation of flood and drought events accordingly the results of this study showed low medium and high rainfall clusters which is related to flood and drought events and most rainfall stations indicated positive increasing trend for medium and high rainfall clusters thus an investigation into low medium and high rainfall clusters is a very important issue in hydrological meteorological and climatological events murat and √∂zyildirim 2017 the results of this study are in line with many researchers findings e g ≈üen 2012 haktanir and citakoglu 2014 kisi 2015 wang et al 2020 4 2 2 seasonal rainfall the statistical results of the mk trend test and sen s slope estimators for the seasonal rainfall are given in table 2 from these results it can be understood that there is an increasing trend during the kiremt season in majority of the rainfall stations in the belg season only five rainfall stations displayed statistically significant trend as indicated in table 2 no significant trend was found in the bega season generally the finding of mk and sse indicate similar rainfall patterns and trends in the annual and kiremt season this similarity further indicates high contribution of kiremt rainfall to annual rainfall in all the stations in the uwsrb the correlation coefficient between mean annual and kiremt rainfall is 0 71 and it falls in the moderate correlation li et al 2014 moreover the major contribution of the kiremt rainfall to annual rainfall has been widely reported in various previous studies bewket and conway 2007 pingale et al 2014 bekele et al 2017a 2017b birara et al 2018 weldegerima et al 2017 in general these studies showed a kiremt season is the main contributor of to the annual rainfall in other parts of ethiopia furthermore the results of this study are similar to that of weldegerima et al 2017 who studied the lake tana sub basin of ethiopia wherein the values of mk trend tests of the kiremt season increased in large portion of the stations another report in awash river basin bekele et al 2017a showed an increasing trend likewise according to birara et al 2018 at a significant level of 5 and 10 most rainfall stations in tana basins were in a decreasing trend in the belg and bega seasons in addition non significant trend was noted for the bega and belg seasons in the lake tana sub basin throughout 1979 2015 weldegerima et al 2017 the cluster classification of the ita at each timescale is given in figs 9 and supplementary s2 and s3 for kiremt bega and belg seasons respectively for the period of 1989 2018 there was variations cluster classification in the ita method among the different seasons for the kiremt season eleven rainfall stations were detected to have increased tendencies for medium and high rainfall clusters as can be seen from fig 9 eight and six stations show increasing and decreasing low rainfall clusters respectively and no trend is indicated at low rainfall cluster in five of the stations for the bega season most of the rainfall stations displayed decreasing trend analysis for low and high rainfall clusters whereas for medium rainfall cluster slightly increasing and decreasing trends and trendless are observed supplementary s2 however during the belg season most stations revealed an increasing trend analysis for medium and high rainfall clusters supplementary s3 the temporal variations of rainfall clusters are more consistent for kiremt and belg seasons bega season shows the most decreasing trend analysis of rainfall clusters especially for low and high rainfall supplementary s2 generally in each timescale most rainfall stations showed non monotonic trend the variability of the rainfall clusters differs in each season for instance in the bega season results showed decreasing trend analysis for low and medium rainfall clusters it indicated that the variability of the rainfall clusters in the bega season is fairly decreasing trend therefore bega is the dry season of the country particularly in the study area seleshi and zanke 2004 segele et al 2008 national meteorological agency nma 2014 bekele et al 2017a 2017b belihu et al 2017 mekonnen et al 2018 jilo et al 2019 gurara et al 2021a if this trend continues in the future period it will highly influence the water resources potential of the area and hence the agriculture practices too in relation to this gurara et al 2021a reported a decreasing rainfall in bega season in the upper wabe bridge watershed a part of uwsrb increasing trend for the kiremt season may indicate the events of flood heavy rain appears in the kiremt season and the season is the most suitable for agricultural activities gurara et al 2021b this finding is important as it offers implications for water resources planning and management endeavors fig 10 depicts the temporal evaluation of sai in annual and seasonal rainfall which is compared with mk and ita methods findings in the annual time period eight and ten rainfall stations indicated positive and negative values of sai respectively although the results of the mk trend test eleven and eight rainfall stations showed increasing and decreasing trends respectively table 2 similarly in the ita method the majority of the stations show a slightly increasing trend analysis in annual timescale a large portion of the rainfall stations showed positive and negative values of sai mk and ita method during the kiremt and bega timescales respectively these results indicate that sai is in a good relation with mk and ita methods in the uwsrb further the relation among sai mk and ita is found to be in line with each other in most rainfall stations in addition the analysis of this relationship could be help more in understanding the temporal variability of rainfall which can have influence on wet and dry seasons of the study area the result of this study is in line with yilmaz 2019 similar results were obtained when we compared the outcomes the of sai mk and ita methods 4 3 spatial mapping of annual and seasonal rainfall trends by mk and ita methods the spatial distribution of the annual and seasonal rainfall trends was identified using the mk and ita methods figs 11 and 12 in the figures the big sky blue color represents a significant positive trend the ginger pink color represents a significant negative trend and the medium apple color shows a non significant trend in the mk trend test a large portion of the stations polygon showed non significant trend in annual kiremt and belg timescales as presented in fig 11 a b d and table 2 in the bega season all areas of tps showed a non significant trend at a 5 significance level fig 11 c however the spatial map of the ita method a large portion of the stations polygon showed significant positive trend in annual kiremt and belg timescales as presented in fig 12 a b d and tables 3 4 moreover in the bega season a significant positive and negative trend was found in five and nine stations polygons respectively while five rainfall stations showed non significant trend fig 12 c in both mk and ita methods the spatial map of annual and seasonal rainfall showed heterogeneity trend behavior in the area various studies were conducted throughout ethiopia on spatio temporal trend analysis of rainfall using parametric and non parametric methods e g wagesho et al 2013 gummadi et al 2017 alemu and bawoke 2019 spatial mapping of the results of trend analysis have been used to understand the impacts of global and regional climate change and climatic variability on the present and future water resources wagesho et al 2013 particularly the results of the present study agree with gummadi et al 2017 who argued that the trends observed in this area indicate substantial changes in amount and distribution of rainfall a large spatial temporal heterogeneity of trends over a large spatial area further affirms the robustness of the trends and even it may be a foundation for understanding the variability of climate and water resources in addition malik et al 2019 also noted that the spatial variability of rainfall trend is very important for impact assessment and adaptation planning for floods droughts and extreme events 4 4 comparison of trend analysis methods the findings of annual and seasonal rainfall using the mk trend test and ita method are summarized in table 5 in this study the total series of 76 annual and seasonal time series were analyzed using mk and ita methods at a 5 significance level with the mk test significant trends were detected in 23 time series in all timescales whereas the ita method showed 67 time series significant trends in all annual and seasonal timescales all the significant trends detected by the mk test were also identified by the ita technique however in the bega season 14 rainfall stations that were not detected by the mk trend test have been rather identified by the ita method hence the ita method is more appropriate to detect many hidden significant trends of rainfall which could otherwise not be identified by the mk method in the annual and seasonal rainfall series malik et al 2019 wang et al 2020 furthermore this finding promotes the credibility of the ita method this method classifies the results into low medium and high rainfall clusters hence this method is used for efficient and optimum management of water resources as it illuminates monotonic and non monotonic trends for a given time series ≈üen 2012 wang et al 2020 in addition ita techniques can deliver useful information and a priori view to the authorities and designers illustrating climate change scenarios kisi et al 2018 moreover as wang et al 2020 stated water authorities and risk managers can benefit comprehensive assessment by using ita compared with mk test ita method helps to identify the frequency of extreme events such as high values for floods and low values for droughts dabanlƒ± et al 2016 moreover the ita method is found to be more robust for trend analysis in time series data as it can be demonstrated graphically on the cartesian coordinate system in order to provide a clear visual display for further clarification it is a visual graphical method and provides an assessment of trends in different groups this idea was supported by ≈üen 2017 furthermore the ita method is relatively simple to comprehend and perform analysis in addition the ita method does not depend on different assumptions serial correlation and seasonal cycle cui et al 2017 ≈üen 2017 zhou et al 2018 5 conclusions this study focused on an investigation of the spatial distribution and temporal rainfall variability and trend analysis in the uwsrb it assumed that this is vital for understanding the impacts of climate on the environment as it illuminates the events of floods and droughts thus in the study the temporal and spatial rainfall variability was analyzed by cv pci and sai and trend analysis was tested using the mk test sse and the ita method with low medium and high rainfall clusters both for annual and seasonal rainfall the study collected and analyzed data over the time period of 1989 2018 in the uwsrb during this investigation the mean annual rainfall was 939 7 mm with a cv of 27 4 and an sd of 257 5 mm the spatial distribution of seasonal and annual rainfall was found to be heterogeneous in uwsrb during annual and kiremt rainfall the cv showed moderate and high variability over the study area respectively however very high and above limit variation was observed in the bega and belg season rainfall this shows a good relationship between the amount of rainfall distributions in the study area the results of pci were more pronounced in the highland and northeastern parts of the study area in both annual and seasonal time series whereas the monthly rainfall in other parts of the area was extremely uneven distribution with a high concentration and volatility the negative sai values of annual kiremt bega and belg seasons were 54 6 53 3 60 and 58 6 respectively the findings disclosed that most parts of the study area showed negative anomalies dry season the spatial distribution of sai in uwsrb was noticed to have experienced variability in drier and wetter years over the study period the temporal values of the mk trend test depicted that there was a more non significant trend in mean annual rainfall except in hunte hirna jara fedis bedessa bedenno girawa and gursum stations which had significant trends at a 5 level the highest and lowest magnitude of sse of annual rainfall was observed at bedenno and bedessa stations respectively during the kiremt and bega seasons the outcomes of the mk trend test and sse demonstrated upward and downward trends in most rainfall stations respectively moreover for the belg season more than half of the stations had an increasing trend the significant trends of seasonal rainfall were detected at ten stations in kiremt and five stations in belg however in the bega season statistically non significant increasing and decreasing trends were detected in all of the rainfall stations furthermore the findings of the ita method in annual rainfall stations fall above and below 1 1 45o line and all the rainfall stations were significant at a 5 level for annual time period several stations showed a non monotonic trend while haramaya and bedessa stations showed monotonic increasing and decreasing trends respectively in annual and kiremt time period most rainfall stations presented high rainfall clusters and showed increasing trends while low rainfall appeared in bega season mainly exhibiting decreasing trends these results indicate that the probability of occurrence of high flood risk would be in kiremt whereas drought events would appear in bega season for the uwsrb furthermore the spatial mapping of annual and seasonal events by using the ita method showed that most of the annual rainfall stations have significantly increasing trends for the kiremt and belg seasons most rainfall stations have insignificantly increasing trends while in the bega season most of the stations exhibit decreasing trends as found out with the use of the ita method in the kiremt season all rainfall stations were statically significant at the 5 level however in both bega and belg seasons few stations revealed a non significant trend line in this study the results of the mk test and ita method are in complete agreement with trend tests in both annual and seasonal time series all the significant trends analyzed by the mk test were also detected by using the ita method at a 5 significance level however in bega season the significant trend could not be identified by the mk trend test while it was possible to identify it using the ita approach this showed that the ita method is more robust in detecting many hidden significant trends of rainfall which could not otherwise be identified by the mk trend test also the mk trend test was applied for monotonic trend analysis with time series data however the ita method provided low medium and high rainfall clusters for analysis of monotonic and non monotonic trend examination moreover low medium and high rainfall clusters indicate the possibilities of droughts and floods respectively therefore the results of this study are helpful for water resources planning and management for analysis and managing of the impacts of some hazards such as floods and drought further research might reveal the application and implications of this study in other river basins in ethiopian 6 author statement arus edo harka conceptualization methodology writing review editing

8164,study region the upper regions of the yangtze river in china study focus evaluating the rainwater harvesting potential rwhp is essential for alleviating regional drought and water shortage and solving water shortage and water crisis globally however previous studies have mainly focused on arid and semi arid zones whereas the assessment of rwhp in humid and sub humid zones during the dry season is lacking to fill this gap a soil and water assessment tool based on meteorology digital elevation model data soil land use and observed streamflow was constructed for a selected site additionally a method of assessing rwhp in humid and semi humid zones was proposed new hydrological insights for the region the results indicate that the average annual rwhp throughout the dry season march august in the upper regions of the yangtze river is 5657 02 105 m3 and that for spring and summer are 1766 21 105 and 3890 95 105 m3 respectively regarding the rwhp structure it was observed that surface runoff 42 59 groundwater recharge 29 53 base flow 19 43 soil water content 7 16 lateral flow 1 29 the analysis indicated that the spatial distribution of rwhp is consistent with that of drought and can alleviate agricultural drought the inter annual variation of rwhp was relatively stable exhibiting a weak increasing trend at the seasonal dry spring and summer and monthly march august scales during 1999 2018 rwhp trends are primarily regulated by rainfall with the trend for a small part of the region being influenced by evapotranspiration our study provides a reference for the evaluation of rwhp in dry seasons in humid and semi humid zones keywords rainwater harvesting potential humid region semi humid region spatial pattern temporal dynamics dry seasons 1 introduction in recent years climate change and human activities have had significant influence on natural hydrological processes causing a series of problems such as water shortage and soil erosion which consequently hinder the sustainable development of the regional economy and ecological environment to a significant extent condon et al 2020 wang et al 2015 2020 rainwater is one of the most commonly available fresh water resources scientific and reasonable recycling of rainwater resources can increase soil infiltration conserve soil water eliminate the driving force of soil erosion and alleviate regional drought and water shortage additionally it is theorized that rainwater recycling is vital for repairing and promoting the natural water cycle and solving the global water shortage and water crisis sacolo and mkhandi 2020 wu et al 2017 therefore the scientific and rational assessment of the rainwater harvesting potential rwhp has garnered extensive attention from scholars and governments locally and internationally aladenola and adeboye 2009 handia et al 2003 sacolo and mkhandi 2020 owing to global warming and relatively low precipitation drought in arid and semi arid regions has become a significant concern huang et al 2016 li et al 2019 furthermore rainwater recycling has become a focal research point as an important method of addressing the shortage of regional water resources aladenola and adeboye 2009 handia et al 2003 sacolo and mkhandi 2020 the evaluation of the rwhp forms the basis for the implementation of the recycling of rainwater resources wu et al 2017 previous studies on rwhp evaluation primarily focus on arid and semi arid areas santos and de farias 2017 wu et al 2017 zhang et al 2014 santos and de farias 2017 evaluated the rwhp in 71 cities in brazil s semi arid region additionally zhang et al 2014 assessed the rwhp in the semi arid loess plateau of china compared with arid and semi arid zones the rainfall in humid and semi humid zones is more abundant but often uneven with respect to spatiotemporal distribution chen et al 2018 chen and ceng 1997 which can be attributed to floods and droughts occurring in the region qi et al 2017 floods are relatively common in humid and semi humid zones and have thereby drawn increasing attention in contrast droughts have been insufficiently investigated and in some instances disregarded owing to the uneven spatiotemporal distribution of water resources seasonal droughts in many humid and semi humid zones are more severe than those occurring in arid and semi arid zones hu and zhang 2005 qi et al 2017 wang et al 2008 however the rwhp during the dry season in humid and semi humid zones has not been researched extensively and there is a lack of systematic evaluation reports the upper regions of the yangtze river in china can be classified as humid and sub humid zones in this region although summers are characterized by abundant rainfall they feature high temperatures and lower rainfall is observed during spring therefore droughts occur frequently in these two seasons chen et al 2018 chen and ceng 1997 minor and major droughts during spring and summer occur almost annually and once every 3 year on average respectively in the sichuan basin and its surrounding areas the droughts affect a vast area for a long duration chen et al 2018 hu and zhang 2005 shen and chen 2011 notably these two seasons correspond to the planting and growth period of crops therefore recurring droughts have deleteriously affected agricultural production and development in this region hu and zhang 2005 peng et al 2015 the upper regions of the yangtze river are an agricultural production base in china and ecologically fragile chen et al 2018 thus alleviating the occurrence of droughts in this region is of strategic significance to the food and ecological security throughout the yangtze river basin and southeast asia recycling rainwater resources is potential method for alleviating drought the rwhp of the region must be assessed to elucidate its state and determine whether rainwater recycling can effectively alleviate agricultural drought considering the upper regions of the yangtze river in china as an example this study attempts to use hydrological models to evaluate the rwhp in a humid and semi humid region the primary objectives of this study were to 1 develop a method for evaluating the rwhp based on hydrological models in humid and semi humid zones 2 quantify the rwhp in the upper regions of the yangtze river and identify its spatial pattern to determine whether the drought can be alleviated 3 clarify the temporal variation trend of rwhp in the upper regions of the yangtze river and explore the controlling factors in order to provide a basis for the evaluation of rwhp in dry seasons in humid and semi humid zones 2 materials and method 2 1 study area the upper regions of the yangtze river are located between 90 115 e and 25 36 n fig 1 considering this area the river flow through the provinces of chongqing tibet qinghai yunnan guizhou sichuan and hubei in china spanning a total length of approximately 4500 km and accounting for approximately 60 equivalent to 1 million km2 of the total area of the yangtze river basin the region is divided into six watersheds the upper regions of jinsha river jruw the middle lower regions of jinsha river jrdw the min and tuo river mtrw the jialing river jrw the wujiang river wrw and the yibin to yichang section yyw fig 1 the altitude ranges between 28 and 6492 m fig 1 meanwhile sichuan basin the fourth largest basin in china is a part of the upper yangtze river wen et al 2020 the sichuan basin low lying geographical feature is an important agricultural production base in china qi et al 2017 the source of the yangtze river above the zhimenda hydrological station belongs to the semi humid zone of the qinghai tibet alpline zone whereas the area below the zhimenda hydrological station belongs to the humid zone of the subtropical monsoon zone fig 1 2 2 datasets the soil and water assessment tool swat model was used to evaluate the rwhp of the region swat models were developed by the agricultural research service ars of the united states department of agriculture usda to simulate watershed hydrological processes soil erosion processes nutrient migration and crop growth processes luo 2021 woo et al 2021 owing to its remarkable adaptability the model has been extensively used worldwide which evidences its remarkable performance li and fang 2021 luo et al 2017 the main data required to construct the swat model include the digital elevation model dem land use soil observed streamflow and meteorological and other basic data such as river network and boundary vector demdata were used to delineate sub basins land use and soil data were used to delineate hydrological response units hrus observed streamflow of the hydrological station was used to calibrate and validate the model land use data were obtained for four periods 2000 2005 2010 and 2015 the daily maximum temperature minimum temperature sunshine duration average wind speed average relative humidity and rainfall observation data from 41 meteorological stations in the study area from 1999 to 2018 were used in the model meteorological database the swat model requires input of monthly discharge data from the reservoir the corresponding data of eight reservoirs such as xiluodu xiangjiaba jingpingyiji ertan pubugou tingzikou hongjiadu and goupitan were used in this study from 2007 to 2015 monthly runoff observation data from six hydrological stations zhimengda shigu tongzilin gaochang wulong and yichang were used for model calibration and validation the sources and details of data are presented in table 1 and the spatial distributions of weather and hydrological stations are shown in fig 1 2 3 method 2 3 1 connotation of rainwater harvesting potential rainwater harvesting refers to recycling of rainwater by controlling the spatiotemporal distribution of rainwater across the underlying surface an rhwp value is generated that facilitates the transformation of rainwater to readily available water resources feng et al 2001 zhao et al 2007 based on perspective of natural and social attributes of rainwater there are two methods of rainwater recycling 1 the process of natural rainwater recycling wherein as a natural product rainwater supplements the growth of vegetation in the natural state through infiltration runoff generation and confluence for example forest hydrological processes 2 the process of artificial rainwater recycling wherein as a social product rainwater can be transformed into resources for agricultural production or human and animal use through human intervention for example water processes for industrial production and trade rwhp includes natural and artificial rainwater recycling potential after examining the results of previous studies ma et al 2018 wu et al 2017 zhang et al 2014 zhao et al 2010 this study considers rwhp to be the most effective tool in converting rainwater into an available resource through natural and artificial resource recycling process under the current social development and scientific and technological conditions this consideration is based on the premise and guarantee of water ecological civilization construction 2 3 2 calculation of rainwater harvesting potential according to the aforementioned connotation rwhp refers to the theoretical maximum value of rainwater that can be recycled through various ways and technologies for a closed watershed region rainfall is the freshwater replenishment source for all forms of land water at the seasonal scale the amount of rainfall can be considered as the total amount of renewable freshwater resources in the region when an external water source is lacking the total rwhp indicates the total amount of seasonal rainfall in the region the calculation formula is as follows 1 r t i 1 n p i a i 1 0 3 r t i 1 n p i a i 1 0 3 where rt is the total rwhp m3 of season t of the basin pi is the amount of rainfall mm during season t of the ith sub basin of the basin a i is the area km2 of the ith sub basin of the basin and n is the number of sub basins in the basin thus the total rwhp is related to the rainfall in the basin eq 1 the total rwhp varies on a yearly basis for the same season due to corresponding variations in rainfall however eq 1 only calculates the rwhp from the perspective of total rainfall without considering the redistribution process of rainfall on the ground based on the water cycle after rainwater falls to the ground it is primarily converted into vegetation interception surface runoff interplant evaporation plant transpiration soil water content lateral flow groundwater recharge and base flow therefore the annual rainfall of the ith sub basin of a basin can be more effectively expressed as follows 2 p i Œ¥ r j i Œ¥ r s i Œ¥ e s i Œ¥ e v i Œ¥ r o i Œ¥ s i Œ¥ g i Œ¥ b f i p i Œ¥ r j i Œ¥ r s i Œ¥ e s i Œ¥ e v i Œ¥ r o i Œ¥ s i Œ¥ g i Œ¥ b f i where r ji represents vegetation interception mm r si denotes surface runoff mm e si is interplant evaporation mm e vi is plant transpiration mm r oi is lateral flow mm s i is soil water content net increment of soil available water mm g i is groundwater recharge mm and bf i is base flow mm therefore the calculation formula of rwhp can be further improved as follows 3 r t i 1 n Œ¥ r j i Œ¥ r s i Œ¥ e s i Œ¥ e v i Œ¥ r o i Œ¥ s i Œ¥ g i Œ¥

vi in eq 3 are unavoidable and cannot be fully recycled anthropogenically interplant transpiration e si and plant transpiration e vi are valid losses in nature and are utilized by plants for physiological processes therefore for a certain basin the rwhp in season t can be expressed using eq 4 4 p a r i r t Œ¥ p 1 Œ¥ p 2 p a r i r t Œ¥ p 1 Œ¥ p 2 in eq 4 par i represents the rwhp m3 p1 is

below the zhimenda hydrology station the groundwater depth is very shallow ranging from 1 5 to 4 5 m wang et al 2011 wu 2014 owing to frequent spring and summer droughts wells have been drilled in many agricultural areas to enable extraction of groundwater for irrigation wei et al 2020 zhang et al 2008 therefore groundwater recharge and base flow should be considered in the calculation of rwhp vegetation interception r ji will eventually be utilized as evapotranspiration and rji the sum of interplant transpiration e si and plant transpiration e vi essentially yield evapotranspiration et t

of rainfall period 2 3 3 model setup the swat 2012 version was used in this study the model first generated the river network reach layer based on the input dem data and then generated the sub basin layer based on the set threshold of the minimum water catchment area to prevent spatial deviation of the generated river network we incorporated the actual river network map in this study a threshold of 77 922 ha was selected and a total of 55 sub basins were generated the slope was divided into two grades 0 25 and 25 99 soil data and land use maps were then loaded into the model to obtain the hrus the model eventually divided the 55 sub basins into 5033 hrus the established custom soil attribute database and meteorological database were imported and the swat model was run the model utilizes many parameters to identify the primary parameters that can affect the accuracy and improve the calibration efficiency it is necessary to conduct a parameter sensitivity analysis on the model in this study the lh oat method latin hypercube one factor at a time was used for parameter sensitivity analysis gong et al 2017 after the sensitivity analysis of parameters the sufi 2 algorithm shivhare et al 2018 was used to calibrate and validate the model in swat cup in this study the coefficient of determination r2 nash coefficient ns percentage bias pbias and standard coefficient of root mean square error rsr were used to measure the simulation effect of the model moriasi et al 2007 r2 ranged from 0 to 1 the larger the value the more optimized the simulation effect generally 0 75

simulation results met the requirements moriasi et al 2007 in this study the monthly observed streamflow data of hydrological stations from 2007 to 2011 were used for model calibration and the data

the swat model from 1999 to 2018 were collated to calculate the amount of rwhp in corresponding time 2 3 4 data analysis the man kendall mk test is a widely used nonparametric test method for change trend that is recommended by the world meteorological organization the mk test is a rank based nonparametric method that does not require the analyzed data to adhere to a certain probability distribution and is it constrained by individual outliers therefore it can objectively represent the overall change trend of the sample series and is widely used in the analysis of climate parameters and hydrological series ijaz et al 2015 santos et al 2015 in this study the Œ≤ index of the mk trend test was used to identify the change trend of rwhp and temperature a Œ≤ value 0 indicates an increasing trend whereas a value 0 indicates a decreasing trend luo et al 2017 santos et al 2015 linear regression has been extensively studied and utilized in practical application luo et al 2017 nagelkerke 1991 in a linear regression equation with one variable the slope represents the annual mean rate of change Œ± in this study the coefficient of determination r2 indicates the extent of influence that the independent variable has on the dependent variable nagelkerke 1991 in this study the primary factors influencing rwhp variation in the study area were identified based on hydrological model outputs and unitary linear regression the value of r2 ranges from 0 to 1 both inclusive the larger the coefficient of determination the greater the contribution to the dependent variable if the coefficient of the value of r2 is 0 50 the independent variable is considered to be a controlling factor luo et al 2017 nagelkerke 1991 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration results in this study monthly observed streamflow from six hydrological stations zhimenda shigu gaochang tongzilin wulong and yichang was used to calibrate and validate the model our results indicate that the values of r2 for all hydrological stations in the calibration period 2007 2011 are 0 85 fig 2 the ns coefficient is 0 84 rsr value and pbias values range from 0 23 to 0 40 and 10 08 to 3 46 both limits included respectively figs 3 and 4 during the validation period 2012 2015 the ns coefficient of all hydrological stations except the gaochang station was 0 85 rsr and pbias values ranged from 0 26 to 0 67 and 10 32 to 6 21 respectively figs 3 and 4 a comparison of figs 2 4 which displays the observed and simulated monthly streamflows suggests that the simulated value of the model is slightly higher according to the standards of previous published studies moriasi et al 2007 the simulation effect of the swat model in the upper regions of the yangtze river is remarkable and can meet the requirements of this study 3 2 rainwater harvesting potential throughout the dry season the average annual rwhp throughout the dry season spring and summer march august in the upper regions of the yangtze river is 5657 02 105 m3 the rwhp in spring is 1766 21 105 m3 whereas the annual rwhp in summer is 3890 95 105 m3 with respect to structure in the total rwhp in the dry seasons surface runoff accounted for the largest contributions of the total rwhp up to 42 59 followed by groundwater recharge 29 53 base flow 19 43 and soil moisture content 7 16 lateral flow 1 29 contributed the least fig 5 in spring rwhp the contributions of surface runoff 36 86 groundwater recharge 31 36 base flow 20 72 soil water content 9 74 and lateral flow 1 32 the composition trend of rwhp in summer was consistent with that in spring and throughout the dry season that is surface runoff was the largest contributions 45 19 followed by groundwater recharge 28 71 base flow 18 83 soil moisture content 5 98 and lateral flow 1 29 fig 5 among the six watersheds the mtrw has the highest rwhp 2657 07 105 m3 followed by the jrdw 944 95 105 m3 yyw 583 15 105 m3 wrw 509 32 105 m3 jruw 484 47 105 m3 and jrw 478 20 105 m3 fig 6 a in this study the spatial distribution pattern of annual average rwhp throughout the dry season march august in the study area was further determined using sub basin as the basic unit as shown in fig 6b hot spots of rwhp are mainly located in sichuan basin and its surrounding areas which are characterized by a relatively flat terrain fig 1 this observation is consistent with the spatial distribution of crop production cultivated land fig 7 however the rwhp in the grassland distribution areas around the source of the yangtze river is relatively low figs 6b and 7 throughout the dry season march august spring and summer the composition of the rwhp was consistent to the general trends that is surface runoff groundwater recharge base flow soil water content lateral flow this is closely related to the runoff generation mode and surface conditions in this area which primarily comprise saturation excess runoff generation and rainfall is easily converted to surface runoff however the widely distributed red bed surfaces peng and wu 2003 exhibit poor water conservation ability and form surface runoff rapidly and easily which collects in the river channel peng et al 2015 zhang et al 2008 therefore extensive surface runoff is observed whereas the soil water content and lateral flow are relatively low sichuan basin is an important agricultural production base in china with a large number of rice crops with high water consumption thus severe droughts lead to the greatest agricultural loss in the study area hu and zhang 2005 wang et al 2008 the source of the yangtze river and its surrounding areas primarily constitute stock farming with grassland being the main land use type forage grass consumes less water than rice thereby mitigating the impact of drought on agriculture in this region chen and ceng 1997 jiang et al 2021 our study demonstrates that the sichuan basin and its surrounding areas are hot spots of rwhp and feature a large amount of rainwater resources while the source of the yangtze river and its surrounding grassland distribution area features low rwhp this is contrary to the trends of drought influence on agriculture this consequently indicates that the comprehensive recycling of potential rainwater can compensate for the uneven spatial distribution of water resources in this region and alleviate agricultural drought 3 3 spring rainwater harvesting potential 3 3 1 spatial variation the average annual rwhp in spring throughout the study area is 1766 21 105 m3 of which 416 80 105 555 74 105 and 793 67 105 m3 occur in march april and may respectively in spring the mtrw exhibits the highest rwhp 1146 43 105 m3 followed by yyw 188 32 105 m3 and wrw 144 79 105 m3 table 2 in march april and may the rwhp of the entire study area and the six watersheds all displayed identical spatial distribution patterns the maximum value was observed in may followed by april and minimum value in march table 2 among the six watersheds the mtrw exhibited the highest rwhp in march april and may 342 55 105 377 61 105 and 426 27 105 m3 respectively table 2 the annual average rwhp in the upper regions of the yangtze river in spring march april and may displayed a generally consistent spatial distribution pattern hot spots were primarily located in sichuan basin and its environs and sparsely distributed in other areas fig 8 rwhp is lowest at the source area of the yangtze river and its environs and the maximum value is observed in march fig 8b the spring drought primarily affects the water requirement of spring plowing in paddy fields and the seedling growth of crops hu and zhang 2005 lang 2018 droughts in march and april affect the flowering of wheat and early rice sowing as it depletes the water required for rice transplanting in paddy fields hu and zhang 2005 lang 2018 the spring drought in the upper regions of the yangtze river mainly occurred in the western and central parts of the sichuan basin and the upper regions of the wujiang river where the frequency of drought was 70 severe droughts occurred approximately once every 3 year chen and ceng 1997 lang 2018 the frequency of spring drought in other areas of sichuan basin is approximately 30 60 chen and ceng 1997 lang 2018 and the frequency of spring drought is approximately 50 chen and ceng 1997 lang 2018 qi et al 2017 our research results indicate that these areas coincide with the rwhp hot spots and have abundant available rainwater resources this indicates that the recycling of spring rainwater resources in the upper regions of the yangtze river has potential application value and can alleviate the agricultural drought to a large extent 3 3 2 temporal trends of rainwater harvesting potential in spring as shown in table 3 from 1999 to 2018 the rwhp throughout the study area showed an increasing trend in spring march april and may with average annual growth rates of 6 17 105 2 86 105 2 14 105 and 1 17 105 m3 respectively however certain spatial differences were observed across the study area for example the rwhp values of the mtrw in spring march april and may all displayed an increasing trend and the increasing trend in spring and may passed the significance level of 0 1 similar to the mtrw the rwhp in jrw exhibits an increasing trend but is relatively weak in the jruw the rwhp in spring and may exhibits a decreasing trend but increased in march and april in spring and march the rwhp in wrw showed an increasing trend and a decreasing trend in april and may in general the rwhp in the study area showed an increasing trend but it was weak 0 6 17 105 m3 yr and most of the areas did not pass the significant level of 0 1 rainfall is the input of rainwater resource utilization potential and exhibits inter annual variation this study aimed to determine whether the trend of rwhp in spring and in march april and may was attributable to rainfall our research results show table 4 that the trend of rwhp in spring march april and may in most areas is under rainfall control r2 0 5 however the explanatory power of rainfall in certain areas is very low r2 0 5 which indicates that factors other than rainfall control the change in rwhp combined with eq 7 the rwhp can clearly be expressed as rainfall with the actual et subtracted from it then the change of the potential in rainwater resource utilization is affected by the two components of rainfall and et therefore for regions where rainfall has low explanatory power r2 0 5 the controlling factor for the change in rwhp is not rainfall which can only be et therefore the trend of rwhp in spring and may throughout the study area spring and may in the jruw spring and may in mtrw may in wrw and may in yyw are controlled by et and not by rainfall meanwhile rainfall in a few areas has relatively little control over the trend change such as the spring of jrw and the spring in yyw which indicates that although et is not a controlling factor in these areas it has greater influence table 4 et is mainly affected by energy moisture and underlying surface conditions bai et al 2020 zou et al 2017 temperature represents the energy supply and has significant effect on et zou et al 2017 the higher the temperature the higher the proportion of the solar energy absorbed for et gu et al 2008 the increase in temperature will lead to an increase in et capacity and increase et in humid and semi humid areas with sufficient moisture zhang et al 2020 our results show that the temperature of spring march may march april and may throughout the study area showed an upward trend except for the jurw in april the jrdw in april and the mtrw in april moreover the increasing trend in many regions is significant for example the increasing trend in the jrdw in may passed the detection of the significance level of 0 01 table 5 increased temperature will lead to increased et which will further increase the influence of et on the change in rwhp land use change as a feature of the underlying surface is also an important factor that affects et bai et al 2020 by changing the redistribution and energy balance of rainwater jia et al 2017 lu et al 2015 the land use in the study area from 1999 to 2018 showed two important characteristics firstly the cultivated land decreased significantly 5487 km2 while forest 1 063 km2 and grassland 779 km2 increased fig 9 this is mainly because the chinese government has implemented a series of ecological restoration projects in the study area especially the project of returning farmland to forest and grassland and the project of natural forest protection bryan et al 2018 another important feature is that the area of impervious surface increases significantly 3677 km2 fig 9 the increase in grassland and forest will increase vegetation interception and plant transpiration bai et al 2020 jia et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 previous studies have shown that the increase in grassland area caused by the grassland restoration project in the source of the yangtze river resulted in an increase in et by 35 9 mm jia et al 2017 an increase in forest area will lead to an even larger increase in et with approximately 45 of terrestrial et coming from forest maximov 2010 in addition the expansion of impervious surface enhances the urban heat island effect thus increasing et foley 2005 luo 2021 under the dual effects of land use change and temperature rise the impact of et on the change in rwhp is enhanced and has become a controlling factor in certain regions 3 4 summer rainwater harvesting potential 3 4 1 spatial pattern the rwhp of the upper regions of the yangtze river in summer is 3890 95 105 m3 and the rwhp in july is the largest 1402 35 105 m3 followed by august 1297 87 105 m3 and june 1190 73 105 m3 table 6 among the six watersheds the mtrb has the largest rwhp in summer june july and august which are 1510 64 105 454 86 105 525 74 105 and 530 04 105 m3 respectively table 6 the minimum values of rwhp in summer june and july all appeared in jrw which were 364 11 105 94 89 105 and 154 15 105 m3 respectively the minimum value of rwhp in summer appeared in wrw in august which was 101 30 105 m3 table 6 the spatial pattern of rwhp throughout summer june july and august in the study area is generally consistent the sichuan basin and the southwest of the study area are large and other areas are relatively small in the three months of summer the hot spots mainly cover the sichuan basin and its surrounding areas in june and then expand westward in july covering the widest range finally shrinking eastward in august fig 10 summer drought leads to lack of water or water shortage after rice transplanting in the second season and also affects pollination of spring maize sowing of summer maize and planting of sweet potato hu and zhang 2005 lang 2018 from july to august rice was in the heading and flowering pollination phase maturity stage summer maize was in the tasseling and silking phase seed setting stage and sweet potato was in the growth stage which was an important stage for the formation of major spring crop yield summer drought causes severe losses with respect to crops summer drought causes dehydration or cracking of the paddy field owing to lack of water during heading and flowering a period during which water is a critical requirement water for rice was not guaranteed and heading and flowering could not occur normally resulting in ear wrapping or even dry death the heading rice could not be pollinated normally and the empty rate increased spring maize ear length shorter grain smaller 100 grain weight decreased summer corn will be extinct chen et al 2018 hu and zhang 2005 lang 2018 the range of summer drought in the upper regions of the yangtze river is larger than that of spring drought and relatively severe in the sichuan basin particularly in the northern part of the sichuan basin chen and ceng 1997 with an occurrence frequency of more than 80 chen and ceng 1997 wujiang river summer drought throughout the basin and the lower regions is relatively severe however owing to summer rainy days in guizhou plateau temperature is not very high and the intensity of summer drought is less than that in sichuan basin chen and ceng 1997 our research results show that the hot spots of rainwater resource potential basically cover these areas with severe summer drought which have high resource value 3 4 2 temporal trends as shown in table 7 the rwhp of the upper regions of the yangtze river in summer june august june july and august generally showed a weak increasing trend although some areas showed a weak decreasing trend table 7 this weak trend in addition to the wrw in july and the mtrw in august through the 0 1 significance test the other are not significant indicating that summer inter annual fluctuations of rwhp in the study area are small and relatively stable our results show that this trend is mainly attributed to changes in rainfall table 8 as table 8 shows in most regions rainfall has high explanatory power for the change in rwhp r2 0 5 indicating that rainfall controls the change of rwhp comparison between tables 8 and 4 shows that the determination coefficient r2 of summer rainfall is generally larger than that of spring indicating that summer rainfall has greater influence on the change in rwhp however the controlling factor of rainwater resource potential in the jurw mtrw and jrw in august is not rainfall but et r2 0 5 due to the continuous increase in temperature table 9 and land use change fig 9 the impact of et on the change in rwhp is enhanced 4 conclusions in this study a method of assessing rwhp in humid and semi humid zones was first proposed and then a swat hydrological model was implemented based on meteorological dem soil and land use data among other data as well as model calibrated and validated by monthly observed streamflow we then quantitatively evaluated the temporal and spatial changes of rwhp in the upper regions of the yangtze river the following conclusions were drawn 1 spatial distribution pattern of rwhp in the upper regions of the yangtze river basin is reasonable and can effectively alleviate agricultural drought the average annual rwhp in the upper regions of the yangtze river is 5657 02 105 m3 the average annual rwhp is 1766 21 105 m3 in spring and 3890 95 105 m3 in summer with respect to the rwhp structure this study found that surface runoff 42 59 groundwater recharge 29 53 base flow 19 43 soil water content 7 16 lateral flow 1 29 among the six watersheds the dry season march august spring summer and each month in the mtrw yielded the largest rwhp spatially the rwhp in the dry season march august spring summer and each month in the upper regions of the yangtze river shows a generally consistent distribution pattern hot spots are mainly located in the sichuan basin and surrounding areas and other areas are relatively small this is contrary to the spatial pattern of agricultural drought that is the rwhp in regions with severe drought is large whereas the rwhp in regions without severe drought is relatively low 2 the rainwater resource potential in the upper regions of the yangtze river becomes relatively stable over time displaying a general weak fluctuation trend and the rainwater recycling value is large except for a small number of regions the change in rainwater resource potential in the study area exhibited a slight increasing trend in dry season march august spring summer and months this fluctuation in most regions is mainly influenced by the change in rainfall and only a few regions are affected by et owing to the rising temperature and the influence of land use change et exhibited an enhanced control effect on the change in rwhp in the study area from 1999 to 2018 author contributions kaisheng luo proposed the scientific hypothesis conceived and designed the

8164,study region the upper regions of the yangtze river in china study focus evaluating the rainwater harvesting potential rwhp is essential for alleviating regional drought and water shortage and solving water shortage and water crisis globally however previous studies have mainly focused on arid and semi arid zones whereas the assessment of rwhp in humid and sub humid zones during the dry season is lacking to fill this gap a soil and water assessment tool based on meteorology digital elevation model data soil land use and observed streamflow was constructed for a selected site additionally a method of assessing rwhp in humid and semi humid zones was proposed new hydrological insights for the region the results indicate that the average annual rwhp throughout the dry season march august in the upper regions of the yangtze river is 5657 02 105 m3 and that for spring and summer are 1766 21 105 and 3890 95 105 m3 respectively regarding the rwhp structure it was observed that surface runoff 42 59 groundwater recharge 29 53 base flow 19 43 soil water content 7 16 lateral flow 1 29 the analysis indicated that the spatial distribution of rwhp is consistent with that of drought and can alleviate agricultural drought the inter annual variation of rwhp was relatively stable exhibiting a weak increasing trend at the seasonal dry spring and summer and monthly march august scales during 1999 2018 rwhp trends are primarily regulated by rainfall with the trend for a small part of the region being influenced by evapotranspiration our study provides a reference for the evaluation of rwhp in dry seasons in humid and semi humid zones keywords rainwater harvesting potential humid region semi humid region spatial pattern temporal dynamics dry seasons 1 introduction in recent years climate change and human activities have had significant influence on natural hydrological processes causing a series of problems such as water shortage and soil erosion which consequently hinder the sustainable development of the regional economy and ecological environment to a significant extent condon et al 2020 wang et al 2015 2020 rainwater is one of the most commonly available fresh water resources scientific and reasonable recycling of rainwater resources can increase soil infiltration conserve soil water eliminate the driving force of soil erosion and alleviate regional drought and water shortage additionally it is theorized that rainwater recycling is vital for repairing and promoting the natural water cycle and solving the global water shortage and water crisis sacolo and mkhandi 2020 wu et al 2017 therefore the scientific and rational assessment of the rainwater harvesting potential rwhp has garnered extensive attention from scholars and governments locally and internationally aladenola and adeboye 2009 handia et al 2003 sacolo and mkhandi 2020 owing to global warming and relatively low precipitation drought in arid and semi arid regions has become a significant concern huang et al 2016 li et al 2019 furthermore rainwater recycling has become a focal research point as an important method of addressing the shortage of regional water resources aladenola and adeboye 2009 handia et al 2003 sacolo and mkhandi 2020 the evaluation of the rwhp forms the basis for the implementation of the recycling of rainwater resources wu et al 2017 previous studies on rwhp evaluation primarily focus on arid and semi arid areas santos and de farias 2017 wu et al 2017 zhang et al 2014 santos and de farias 2017 evaluated the rwhp in 71 cities in brazil s semi arid region additionally zhang et al 2014 assessed the rwhp in the semi arid loess plateau of china compared with arid and semi arid zones the rainfall in humid and semi humid zones is more abundant but often uneven with respect to spatiotemporal distribution chen et al 2018 chen and ceng 1997 which can be attributed to floods and droughts occurring in the region qi et al 2017 floods are relatively common in humid and semi humid zones and have thereby drawn increasing attention in contrast droughts have been insufficiently investigated and in some instances disregarded owing to the uneven spatiotemporal distribution of water resources seasonal droughts in many humid and semi humid zones are more severe than those occurring in arid and semi arid zones hu and zhang 2005 qi et al 2017 wang et al 2008 however the rwhp during the dry season in humid and semi humid zones has not been researched extensively and there is a lack of systematic evaluation reports the upper regions of the yangtze river in china can be classified as humid and sub humid zones in this region although summers are characterized by abundant rainfall they feature high temperatures and lower rainfall is observed during spring therefore droughts occur frequently in these two seasons chen et al 2018 chen and ceng 1997 minor and major droughts during spring and summer occur almost annually and once every 3 year on average respectively in the sichuan basin and its surrounding areas the droughts affect a vast area for a long duration chen et al 2018 hu and zhang 2005 shen and chen 2011 notably these two seasons correspond to the planting and growth period of crops therefore recurring droughts have deleteriously affected agricultural production and development in this region hu and zhang 2005 peng et al 2015 the upper regions of the yangtze river are an agricultural production base in china and ecologically fragile chen et al 2018 thus alleviating the occurrence of droughts in this region is of strategic significance to the food and ecological security throughout the yangtze river basin and southeast asia recycling rainwater resources is potential method for alleviating drought the rwhp of the region must be assessed to elucidate its state and determine whether rainwater recycling can effectively alleviate agricultural drought considering the upper regions of the yangtze river in china as an example this study attempts to use hydrological models to evaluate the rwhp in a humid and semi humid region the primary objectives of this study were to 1 develop a method for evaluating the rwhp based on hydrological models in humid and semi humid zones 2 quantify the rwhp in the upper regions of the yangtze river and identify its spatial pattern to determine whether the drought can be alleviated 3 clarify the temporal variation trend of rwhp in the upper regions of the yangtze river and explore the controlling factors in order to provide a basis for the evaluation of rwhp in dry seasons in humid and semi humid zones 2 materials and method 2 1 study area the upper regions of the yangtze river are located between 90 115 e and 25 36 n fig 1 considering this area the river flow through the provinces of chongqing tibet qinghai yunnan guizhou sichuan and hubei in china spanning a total length of approximately 4500 km and accounting for approximately 60 equivalent to 1 million km2 of the total area of the yangtze river basin the region is divided into six watersheds the upper regions of jinsha river jruw the middle lower regions of jinsha river jrdw the min and tuo river mtrw the jialing river jrw the wujiang river wrw and the yibin to yichang section yyw fig 1 the altitude ranges between 28 and 6492 m fig 1 meanwhile sichuan basin the fourth largest basin in china is a part of the upper yangtze river wen et al 2020 the sichuan basin low lying geographical feature is an important agricultural production base in china qi et al 2017 the source of the yangtze river above the zhimenda hydrological station belongs to the semi humid zone of the qinghai tibet alpline zone whereas the area below the zhimenda hydrological station belongs to the humid zone of the subtropical monsoon zone fig 1 2 2 datasets the soil and water assessment tool swat model was used to evaluate the rwhp of the region swat models were developed by the agricultural research service ars of the united states department of agriculture usda to simulate watershed hydrological processes soil erosion processes nutrient migration and crop growth processes luo 2021 woo et al 2021 owing to its remarkable adaptability the model has been extensively used worldwide which evidences its remarkable performance li and fang 2021 luo et al 2017 the main data required to construct the swat model include the digital elevation model dem land use soil observed streamflow and meteorological and other basic data such as river network and boundary vector demdata were used to delineate sub basins land use and soil data were used to delineate hydrological response units hrus observed streamflow of the hydrological station was used to calibrate and validate the model land use data were obtained for four periods 2000 2005 2010 and 2015 the daily maximum temperature minimum temperature sunshine duration average wind speed average relative humidity and rainfall observation data from 41 meteorological stations in the study area from 1999 to 2018 were used in the model meteorological database the swat model requires input of monthly discharge data from the reservoir the corresponding data of eight reservoirs such as xiluodu xiangjiaba jingpingyiji ertan pubugou tingzikou hongjiadu and goupitan were used in this study from 2007 to 2015 monthly runoff observation data from six hydrological stations zhimengda shigu tongzilin gaochang wulong and yichang were used for model calibration and validation the sources and details of data are presented in table 1 and the spatial distributions of weather and hydrological stations are shown in fig 1 2 3 method 2 3 1 connotation of rainwater harvesting potential rainwater harvesting refers to recycling of rainwater by controlling the spatiotemporal distribution of rainwater across the underlying surface an rhwp value is generated that facilitates the transformation of rainwater to readily available water resources feng et al 2001 zhao et al 2007 based on perspective of natural and social attributes of rainwater there are two methods of rainwater recycling 1 the process of natural rainwater recycling wherein as a natural product rainwater supplements the growth of vegetation in the natural state through infiltration runoff generation and confluence for example forest hydrological processes 2 the process of artificial rainwater recycling wherein as a social product rainwater can be transformed into resources for agricultural production or human and animal use through human intervention for example water processes for industrial production and trade rwhp includes natural and artificial rainwater recycling potential after examining the results of previous studies ma et al 2018 wu et al 2017 zhang et al 2014 zhao et al 2010 this study considers rwhp to be the most effective tool in converting rainwater into an available resource through natural and artificial resource recycling process under the current social development and scientific and technological conditions this consideration is based on the premise and guarantee of water ecological civilization construction 2 3 2 calculation of rainwater harvesting potential according to the aforementioned connotation rwhp refers to the theoretical maximum value of rainwater that can be recycled through various ways and technologies for a closed watershed region rainfall is the freshwater replenishment source for all forms of land water at the seasonal scale the amount of rainfall can be considered as the total amount of renewable freshwater resources in the region when an external water source is lacking the total rwhp indicates the total amount of seasonal rainfall in the region the calculation formula is as follows 1 r t i 1 n p i a i 1 0 3 r t i 1 n p i a i 1 0 3 where rt is the total rwhp m3 of season t of the basin pi is the amount of rainfall mm during season t of the ith sub basin of the basin a i is the area km2 of the ith sub basin of the basin and n is the number of sub basins in the basin thus the total rwhp is related to the rainfall in the basin eq 1 the total rwhp varies on a yearly basis for the same season due to corresponding variations in rainfall however eq 1 only calculates the rwhp from the perspective of total rainfall without considering the redistribution process of rainfall on the ground based on the water cycle after rainwater falls to the ground it is primarily converted into vegetation interception surface runoff interplant evaporation plant transpiration soil water content lateral flow groundwater recharge and base flow therefore the annual rainfall of the ith sub basin of a basin can be more effectively expressed as follows 2 p i Œ¥ r j i Œ¥ r s i Œ¥ e s i Œ¥ e v i Œ¥ r o i Œ¥ s i Œ¥ g i Œ¥ b f i p i Œ¥ r j i Œ¥ r s i Œ¥ e s i Œ¥ e v i Œ¥ r o i Œ¥ s i Œ¥ g i Œ¥ b f i where r ji represents vegetation interception mm r si denotes surface runoff mm e si is interplant evaporation mm e vi is plant transpiration mm r oi is lateral flow mm s i is soil water content net increment of soil available water mm g i is groundwater recharge mm and bf i is base flow mm therefore the calculation formula of rwhp can be further improved as follows 3 r t i 1 n Œ¥ r j i Œ¥ r s i Œ¥ e s i Œ¥ e v i Œ¥ r o i Œ¥ s i Œ¥ g i Œ¥

vi in eq 3 are unavoidable and cannot be fully recycled anthropogenically interplant transpiration e si and plant transpiration e vi are valid losses in nature and are utilized by plants for physiological processes therefore for a certain basin the rwhp in season t can be expressed using eq 4 4 p a r i r t Œ¥ p 1 Œ¥ p 2 p a r i r t Œ¥ p 1 Œ¥ p 2 in eq 4 par i represents the rwhp m3 p1 is the amount of water already used m3 and p2 is the amount of water that is not available m3 5 Œ¥ p 1 i 1 n Œ¥ e s i Œ¥ e v i i a i 1 0 3 Œ¥ p 1 i 1 n Œ¥ e s i Œ¥ e v i i a i 1 0 3 6 Œ¥ p 2 i 1 n Œ¥ r j

below the zhimenda hydrology station the groundwater depth is very shallow ranging from 1 5 to 4 5 m wang et al 2011 wu 2014 owing to frequent spring and summer droughts wells have been drilled in many agricultural areas to enable extraction of groundwater for irrigation wei et al 2020 zhang et al 2008 therefore groundwater recharge and base flow should be considered in the calculation of rwhp vegetation interception r ji will eventually be utilized as evapotranspiration and rji the sum of interplant transpiration e si and plant transpiration e vi essentially yield evapotranspiration et t considering this eqs 3 5 and 6 are substituted into eq 4 to obtain the following formula 7 p a r i r t e t t i 1 n Œ¥ r s i Œ¥ r o i Œ¥ s i Œ¥ g i Œ¥ b f i a i 1 0 3 p a r i r t e t t i 1 n Œ¥ r s i

s b e g 0 Œ¥ s i 0 Œ¥ s i 0 Œ¥ s i s e n d s b e g 0 Œ¥ s i 0 Œ¥ s i 0 where s beg is the effective soil water content mm prior to rainfall and s end mm is the effective soil water content at the end of rainfall period 2 3 3 model setup the swat 2012 version was used in this study the model first generated the river network reach layer based on the input dem data and then generated the sub basin layer based on the set threshold of the minimum water catchment area to prevent spatial deviation of the generated river network we incorporated the actual river network map in this study a threshold of 77 922 ha was selected and a total of 55 sub basins were generated the slope was divided into two grades 0 25 and 25 99 soil data and land use maps were then loaded into the model to obtain the hrus the model eventually divided the 55 sub basins into 5033 hrus the established custom soil attribute database and meteorological database were imported and the swat model was run the model utilizes many parameters to identify the primary parameters that can affect the accuracy and improve the calibration efficiency it is necessary to conduct a parameter sensitivity analysis on the model in this study the lh oat method latin hypercube one factor at a time was used for parameter sensitivity analysis gong et al 2017 after the sensitivity analysis of parameters the sufi 2 algorithm shivhare et al 2018 was used to calibrate and validate the model in swat cup in this study the coefficient of determination r2 nash coefficient ns percentage bias pbias and standard coefficient of root mean square error rsr were used to measure the simulation effect of the model moriasi et al 2007 r2 ranged from 0 to 1 the larger the value the more optimized the simulation effect generally 0 75 ns 1 00 0 00 rsr 0 50 and pbias 10 indicate good simulation results 0 65 ns 0 75 0 50 rsr 0 60 and 10 pbias 15 indicate good simulation results 0 50 ns 0 65 0 60 rsr 0 70 and 15 pbias 25 show that the simulation results met the requirements moriasi et al 2007 in this study the monthly observed streamflow data of hydrological stations from 2007 to 2011 were used for model calibration and the data from 2012 to 2015 were used for model validation 9 n s 1 i 1 n q i o b s q i s i m 2 i 1 n q i o b s q o b s m e a n 2 10 p b i a s i 1 n q i o b s q i s i m 100 i 1 n q i o b s 11 r s r i 1 n q i o b

periods of land use data from 2000 2005 2010 and 2015 were input to represent the land use situation during 2000 2004 2005 2009 2010 2014 and 2015 2018 respectively the simulation output results of the swat model from 1999 to 2018 were collated to calculate the amount of rwhp in corresponding time 2 3 4 data analysis the man kendall mk test is a widely used nonparametric test method for change trend that is recommended by the world meteorological organization the mk test is a rank based nonparametric method that does not require the analyzed data to adhere to a certain probability distribution and is it constrained by individual outliers therefore it can objectively represent the overall change trend of the sample series and is widely used in the analysis of climate parameters and hydrological series ijaz et al 2015 santos et al 2015 in this study the Œ≤ index of the mk trend test was used to identify the change trend of rwhp and temperature a Œ≤ value 0 indicates an increasing trend whereas a value 0 indicates a decreasing trend luo et al 2017 santos et al 2015 linear regression has been extensively studied and utilized in practical application luo et al 2017 nagelkerke 1991 in a linear regression equation with one variable the slope represents the annual mean rate of change Œ± in this study the coefficient of determination r2 indicates the extent of influence that the independent variable has on the dependent variable nagelkerke 1991 in this study the primary factors influencing rwhp variation in the study area were identified based on hydrological model outputs and unitary linear regression the value of r2 ranges from 0 to 1 both inclusive the larger the coefficient of determination the greater the contribution to the dependent variable if the coefficient of the value of r2 is 0 50 the independent variable is considered to be a controlling factor luo et al 2017 nagelkerke 1991 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration results in this study monthly observed streamflow from six hydrological stations zhimenda shigu gaochang tongzilin wulong and yichang was used to calibrate and validate the model our results indicate that the values of r2 for all hydrological stations in the calibration period 2007 2011 are 0 85 fig 2 the ns coefficient is 0 84 rsr value and pbias values range from 0 23 to 0 40 and 10 08 to 3 46 both limits included respectively figs 3 and 4 during the validation period 2012 2015 the ns coefficient of all hydrological stations except the gaochang station was 0 85 rsr and pbias values ranged from 0 26 to 0 67 and 10 32 to 6 21 respectively figs 3 and 4 a comparison of figs 2 4 which displays the observed and simulated monthly streamflows suggests that the simulated value of the model is slightly higher according to the standards of previous published studies moriasi et al 2007 the simulation effect of the swat model in the upper regions of the yangtze river is remarkable and can meet the requirements of this study 3 2 rainwater harvesting potential throughout the dry season the average annual rwhp throughout the dry season spring and summer march august in the upper regions of the yangtze river is 5657 02 105 m3 the rwhp in spring is 1766 21 105 m3 whereas the annual rwhp in summer is 3890 95 105 m3 with respect to structure in the total rwhp in the dry seasons surface runoff accounted for the largest contributions of the total rwhp up to 42 59 followed by groundwater recharge 29 53 base flow 19 43 and soil moisture content 7 16 lateral flow 1 29 contributed the least fig 5 in spring rwhp the contributions of surface runoff 36 86 groundwater recharge 31 36 base flow 20 72 soil water content 9 74 and lateral flow 1 32 the composition trend of rwhp in summer was consistent with that in spring and throughout the dry season that is surface runoff was the largest contributions 45 19 followed by groundwater recharge 28 71 base flow 18 83 soil moisture content 5 98 and lateral flow 1 29 fig 5 among the six watersheds the mtrw has the highest rwhp 2657 07 105 m3 followed by the jrdw 944 95 105 m3 yyw 583 15 105 m3 wrw 509 32 105 m3 jruw 484 47 105 m3 and jrw 478 20 105 m3 fig 6 a in this study the spatial distribution pattern of annual average rwhp throughout the dry season march august in the study area was further determined using sub basin as the basic unit as shown in fig 6b hot spots of rwhp are mainly located in sichuan basin and its surrounding areas which are characterized by a relatively flat terrain fig 1 this observation is consistent with the spatial distribution of crop production cultivated land fig 7 however the rwhp in the grassland distribution areas around the source of the yangtze river is relatively low figs 6b and 7 throughout the dry season march august spring and summer the composition of the rwhp was consistent to the general trends that is surface runoff groundwater recharge base flow soil water content lateral flow this is closely related to the runoff generation mode and surface conditions in this area which primarily comprise saturation excess runoff generation and rainfall is easily converted to surface runoff however the widely distributed red bed surfaces peng and wu 2003 exhibit poor water conservation ability and form surface runoff rapidly and easily which collects in the river channel peng et al 2015 zhang et al 2008 therefore extensive surface runoff is observed whereas the soil water content and lateral flow are relatively low sichuan basin is an important agricultural production base in china with a large number of rice crops with high water consumption thus severe droughts lead to the greatest agricultural loss in the study area hu and zhang 2005 wang et al 2008 the source of the yangtze river and its surrounding areas primarily constitute stock farming with grassland being the main land use type forage grass consumes less water than rice thereby mitigating the impact of drought on agriculture in this region chen and ceng 1997 jiang et al 2021 our study demonstrates that the sichuan basin and its surrounding areas are hot spots of rwhp and feature a large amount of rainwater resources while the source of the yangtze river and its surrounding grassland distribution area features low rwhp this is contrary to the trends of drought influence on agriculture this consequently indicates that the comprehensive recycling of potential rainwater can compensate for the uneven spatial distribution of water resources in this region and alleviate agricultural drought 3 3 spring rainwater harvesting potential 3 3 1 spatial variation the average annual rwhp in spring throughout the study area is 1766 21 105 m3 of which 416 80 105 555 74 105 and 793 67 105 m3 occur in march april and may respectively in spring the mtrw exhibits the highest rwhp 1146 43 105 m3 followed by yyw 188 32 105 m3 and wrw 144 79 105 m3 table 2 in march april and may the rwhp of the entire study area and the six watersheds all displayed identical spatial distribution patterns the maximum value was observed in may followed by april and minimum value in march table 2 among the six watersheds the mtrw exhibited the highest rwhp in march april and may 342 55 105 377 61 105 and 426 27 105 m3 respectively table 2 the annual average rwhp in the upper regions of the yangtze river in spring march april and may displayed a generally consistent spatial distribution pattern hot spots were primarily located in sichuan basin and its environs and sparsely distributed in other areas fig 8 rwhp is lowest at the source area of the yangtze river and its environs and the maximum value is observed in march fig 8b the spring drought primarily affects the water requirement of spring plowing in paddy fields and the seedling growth of crops hu and zhang 2005 lang 2018 droughts in march and april affect the flowering of wheat and early rice sowing as it depletes the water required for rice transplanting in paddy fields hu and zhang 2005 lang 2018 the spring drought in the upper regions of the yangtze river mainly occurred in the western and central parts of the sichuan basin and the upper regions of the wujiang river where the frequency of drought was 70 severe droughts occurred approximately once every 3 year chen and ceng 1997 lang 2018 the frequency of spring drought in other areas of sichuan basin is approximately 30 60 chen and ceng 1997 lang 2018 and the frequency of spring drought is approximately 50 chen and ceng 1997 lang 2018 qi et al 2017 our research results indicate that these areas coincide with the rwhp hot spots and have abundant available rainwater resources this indicates that the recycling of spring rainwater resources in the upper regions of the yangtze river has potential application value and can alleviate the agricultural drought to a large extent 3 3 2 temporal trends of rainwater harvesting potential in spring as shown in table 3 from 1999 to 2018 the rwhp throughout the study area showed an increasing trend in spring march april and may with average annual growth rates of 6 17 105 2 86 105 2 14 105 and 1 17 105 m3 respectively however certain spatial differences were observed across the study area for example the rwhp values of the mtrw in spring march april and may all displayed an increasing trend and the increasing trend in spring and may passed the significance level of 0 1 similar to the mtrw the rwhp in jrw exhibits an increasing trend but is relatively weak in the jruw the rwhp in spring and may exhibits a decreasing trend but increased in march and april in spring and march the rwhp in wrw showed an increasing trend and a decreasing trend in april and may in general the rwhp in the study area showed an increasing trend but it was weak 0 6 17 105 m3 yr and most of the areas did not pass the significant level of 0 1 rainfall is the input of rainwater resource utilization potential and exhibits inter annual variation this study aimed to determine whether the trend of rwhp in spring and in march april and may was attributable to rainfall our research results show table 4 that the trend of rwhp in spring march april and may in most areas is under rainfall control r2 0 5 however the explanatory power of rainfall in certain areas is very low r2 0 5 which indicates that factors other than rainfall control the change in rwhp combined with eq 7 the rwhp can clearly be expressed as rainfall with the actual et subtracted from it then the change of the potential in rainwater resource utilization is affected by the two components of rainfall and et therefore for regions where rainfall has low explanatory power r2 0 5 the controlling factor for the change in rwhp is not rainfall which can only be et therefore the trend of rwhp in spring and may throughout the study area spring and may in the jruw spring and may in mtrw may in wrw and may in yyw are controlled by et and not by rainfall meanwhile rainfall in a few areas has relatively little control over the trend change such as the spring of jrw and the spring in yyw which indicates that although et is not a controlling factor in these areas it has greater influence table 4 et is mainly affected by energy moisture and underlying surface conditions bai et al 2020 zou et al 2017 temperature represents the energy supply and has significant effect on et zou et al 2017 the higher the temperature the higher the proportion of the solar energy absorbed for et gu et al 2008 the increase in temperature will lead to an increase in et capacity and increase et in humid and semi humid areas with sufficient moisture zhang et al 2020 our results show that the temperature of spring march may march april and may throughout the study area showed an upward trend except for the jurw in april the jrdw in april and the mtrw in april moreover the increasing trend in many regions is significant for example the increasing trend in the jrdw in may passed the detection of the significance level of 0 01 table 5 increased temperature will lead to increased et which will further increase the influence of et on the change in rwhp land use change as a feature of the underlying surface is also an important factor that affects et bai et al 2020 by changing the redistribution and energy balance of rainwater jia et al 2017 lu et al 2015 the land use in the study area from 1999 to 2018 showed two important characteristics firstly the cultivated land decreased significantly 5487 km2 while forest 1 063 km2 and grassland 779 km2 increased fig 9 this is mainly because the chinese government has implemented a series of ecological restoration projects in the study area especially the project of returning farmland to forest and grassland and the project of natural forest protection bryan et al 2018 another important feature is that the area of impervious surface increases significantly 3677 km2 fig 9 the increase in grassland and forest will increase vegetation interception and plant transpiration bai et al 2020 jia et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 previous studies have shown that the increase in grassland area caused by the grassland restoration project in the source of the yangtze river resulted in an increase in et by 35 9 mm jia et al 2017 an increase in forest area will lead to an even larger increase in et with approximately 45 of terrestrial et coming from forest maximov 2010 in addition the expansion of impervious surface enhances the urban heat island effect thus increasing et foley 2005 luo 2021 under the dual effects of land use change and temperature rise the impact of et on the change in rwhp is enhanced and has become a controlling factor in certain regions 3 4 summer rainwater harvesting potential 3 4 1 spatial pattern the rwhp of the upper regions of the yangtze river in summer is 3890 95 105 m3 and the rwhp in july is the largest 1402 35 105 m3 followed by august 1297 87 105 m3 and june 1190 73 105 m3 table 6 among the six watersheds the mtrb has the largest rwhp in summer june july and august which are 1510 64 105 454 86 105 525 74 105 and 530 04 105 m3 respectively table 6 the minimum values of rwhp in summer june and july all appeared in jrw which were 364 11 105 94 89 105 and 154 15 105 m3 respectively the minimum value of rwhp in summer appeared in wrw in august which was 101 30 105 m3 table 6 the spatial pattern of rwhp throughout summer june july and august in the study area is generally consistent the sichuan basin and the southwest of the study area are large and other areas are relatively small in the three months of summer the hot spots mainly cover the sichuan basin and its surrounding areas in june and then expand westward in july covering the widest range finally shrinking eastward in august fig 10 summer drought leads to lack of water or water shortage after rice transplanting in the second season and also affects pollination of spring maize sowing of summer maize and planting of sweet potato hu and zhang 2005 lang 2018 from july to august rice was in the heading and flowering pollination phase maturity stage summer maize was in the tasseling and silking phase seed setting stage and sweet potato was in the growth stage which was an important stage for the formation of major spring crop yield summer drought causes severe losses with respect to crops summer drought causes dehydration or cracking of the paddy field owing to lack of water during heading and flowering a period during which water is a critical requirement water for rice was not guaranteed and heading and flowering could not occur normally resulting in ear wrapping or even dry death the heading rice could not be pollinated normally and the empty rate increased spring maize ear length shorter grain smaller 100 grain weight decreased summer corn will be extinct chen et al 2018 hu and zhang 2005 lang 2018 the range of summer drought in the upper regions of the yangtze river is larger than that of spring drought and relatively severe in the sichuan basin particularly in the northern part of the sichuan basin chen and ceng 1997 with an occurrence frequency of more than 80 chen and ceng 1997 wujiang river summer drought throughout the basin and the lower regions is relatively severe however owing to summer rainy days in guizhou plateau temperature is not very high and the intensity of summer drought is less than that in sichuan basin chen and ceng 1997 our research results show that the hot spots of rainwater resource potential basically cover these areas with severe summer drought which have high resource value 3 4 2 temporal trends as shown in table 7 the rwhp of the upper regions of the yangtze river in summer june august june july and august generally showed a weak increasing trend although some areas showed a weak decreasing trend table 7 this weak trend in addition to the wrw in july and the mtrw in august through the 0 1 significance test the other are not significant indicating that summer inter annual fluctuations of rwhp in the study area are small and relatively stable our results show that this trend is mainly attributed to changes in rainfall table 8 as table 8 shows in most regions rainfall has high explanatory power for the change in rwhp r2 0 5 indicating that rainfall controls the change of rwhp comparison between tables 8 and 4 shows that the determination coefficient r2 of summer rainfall is generally larger than that of spring indicating that summer rainfall has greater influence on the change in rwhp however the controlling factor of rainwater resource potential in the jurw mtrw and jrw in august is not rainfall but et r2 0 5 due to the continuous increase in temperature table 9 and land use change fig 9 the impact of et on the change in rwhp is enhanced 4 conclusions in this study a method of assessing rwhp in humid and semi humid zones was first proposed and then a swat hydrological model was implemented based on meteorological dem soil and land use data among other data as well as model calibrated and validated by monthly observed streamflow we then quantitatively evaluated the temporal and spatial changes of rwhp in the upper regions of the yangtze river the following conclusions were drawn 1 spatial distribution pattern of rwhp in the upper regions of the yangtze river basin is reasonable and can effectively alleviate agricultural drought the average annual rwhp in the upper regions of the yangtze river is 5657 02 105 m3 the average annual rwhp is 1766 21 105 m3 in spring and 3890 95 105 m3 in summer with respect to the rwhp structure this study found that surface runoff 42 59 groundwater recharge 29 53 base flow 19 43 soil water content 7 16 lateral flow 1 29 among the six watersheds the dry season march august spring summer and each month in the mtrw yielded the largest rwhp spatially the rwhp in the dry season march august spring summer and each month in the upper regions of the yangtze river shows a generally consistent distribution pattern hot spots are mainly located in the sichuan basin and surrounding areas and other areas are relatively small this is contrary to the spatial pattern of agricultural drought that is the rwhp in regions with severe drought is large whereas the rwhp in regions without severe drought is relatively low 2 the rainwater resource potential in the upper regions of the yangtze river becomes relatively stable over time displaying a general weak fluctuation trend and the rainwater recycling value is large except for a small number of regions the change in rainwater resource potential in the study area exhibited a slight increasing trend in dry season march august spring summer and months this fluctuation in most regions is mainly influenced by the change in rainfall and only a few regions are affected by et owing to the rising temperature and the influence of land use change et exhibited an enhanced control effect on the change in rwhp in the study area from 1999 to 2018 author contributions kaisheng luo proposed the scientific hypothesis conceived and designed the
