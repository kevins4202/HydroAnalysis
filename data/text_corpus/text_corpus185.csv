925,identifying the main pollutants of non point source pollution within the scope of small watersheds carrying out load estimation and probing its mechanism and characteristics can provide a basis for water quality control and management the nutrient loss characteristics load and reduction rate of nutrients under different land use types were analyzed through the runoff plot monitoring experiment and the non point source pollution load in the watershed was further calculated results showed that the loss of nutrients in each runoff plot was farmland grassland orchard in each runoff plot under the same slope the loss of nutrient performance was maize sweet potato grassland orchard taking s12 as the control group the best reduction rate was orchard grassland sweet potato maize peanut in runoff plot the pollutant concentration under a single rainfall increased first and then decreased with the rainfall time the pollutant concentrations sharply increased with the increase in flow then gradually decreased and finally stabilized at the outlet of the small watershed under a single rainfall at this time the shallow nutrients on the surface were easy to scour into the river resulting in the sharp rise of pollutants in the river in 2020 the losses of ammonia nitrogen nh3 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n total nitrogen tn orthophosphate srp and total phosphorus tp in the basin were 41 77 296 93 494 51 33 87 and 44 03 kg km2 respectively tn and tp were the primary nutrients in this area the research results can provide a reference for the study of non point source pollution in similar areas keywords non point source pollution small watersheds runoff plots reduction rate pollutant concentrations 1 introduction non point source pollution refers to the pollution caused by the migration of pollutants accumulated on the surface into the receiving water body along with the surface runoff or underground runoff produced by rainfall this type of pollution has complex components and various types hao et al 2018 hou et al 2020 the pollution sources include surface runoff pollution soil erosion fertilizers and pesticides rural domestic sewage and livestock and poultry manure non point source pollution comes from non specific and scattered areas and the boundaries and locations are difficult to determine du et al 2014 wang et al 2021 the characteristics of non point source pollution include randomness complex causes and long latency non point source pollution has become the main source of water environmental pollution in recent years with the improvement of the level of point source pollution control qian et al 2021 fu et al 2021 load source analysis and research of migration and transformation for non point source pollution are not only an important research content in the field of river basin water resources and water environment but also the basis and prerequisite for the reasonable assessment and water quality planning geng et al 2014 sui et al 2020 the non point source pollution in china is also quite serious the other problem is the large scale application of fertilizers pesticides and other agricultural chemicals in agricultural activities a small portion of chemicals is absorbed by crops and the rest remains in the soil fang 2021 when it rains these chemicals are washed into the river and becomes a potential source of pollution liu et al 2020 at present most researches on non point source pollution focus on large rivers and the load calculation and control are mainly carried out through software simulation choi et al 2021 zheng et al 2021 however few studies have been conducted on the characteristics and mechanism of non point source pollution loss through field monitoring experiments in small watersheds zhang et al 2017 li et al 2021 how to clarify the characteristics of non point source pollution the mechanism of migration and transformation and the relationship between surface runoff pollutant generation and runoff pollution intensity in the runoff process has become an important scientific issue facing this research zhou et al 2021 lou et al 2020 yan and lu 2020 this concern has gradually developed into a mainstream trend to environmental problems with the deepening of understanding of water wading issues rainfall runoff landform land use type and vegetation cover affect the development of agricultural non point source pollution to varying degrees yang et al 2021 qian et al 2021 in this region the characteristics of nitrogen and phosphorus loss in slope runoff are studied based on artificial rainfall xu et al 2013 yin et al 2007 found that the rainfall kinetic energy and erosion force generated by the rainfall simulator were much lower than those of natural rainfall at present the research on non point source pollution in small watershed mostly focuses on the characteristics of runoff and water and soil loss the distribution characteristics of nitrogen and phosphorus simulated by models and the output characteristics of soil nutrients in sediment wang et al 2022 liao et al 2021 however it is rare to analyze the loss characteristics of nitrogen and phosphorus through high frequency field monitoring in particular the analysis of nitrogen and phosphorus loss characteristics of crops in the process of rainfall under different land use forms is rarely involved this work selected different typical runoff plots such as farmland orchard and grassland based on six typical natural rainfall continuously monitored from 2019 to 2020 based on the field observation data of the yingwugou small watershed in danjiang water source area the effects of rainfall slope land use type and vegetation cover on soil and water loss and nutrient loss were analyzed and the annual load of non point source pollution in this area was calculated by mean concentration method to provide basis for the non point source pollution control in the danjiang river basin the objectives of this work are as follows i to analyze the characteristics of nitrogen and phosphorus loss in the runoff plot ii to perform a correlation analysis of rainfall runoff and runoff pollution in the runoff plots and iii to analyze the characteristics of nitrogen and phosphorus loss at the outlet of the small watershed 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this article selected yingwugou small watershed as the research area which is located in wulipu village chengguan town southeast of shangnan county shangluo city shaanxi province northwest of china fig 1 the watershed is located at e110 52 16 110 55 30 and n33 29 55 33 33 50 the total area of the watershed is 1 86 km2 of which the orchard grassland and farmland areas are 0 52 0 17 and 1 12 km2 respectively this area is a transitional zone between the northern subtropical and the warm temperate zones with plenty of sunshine and four distinct seasons the distribution of precipitation during the year is particularly uneven the average annual precipitation is 803 2 mm and the rainfall is mostly heavy the precipitation from july to september accounts for about 50 of the annual precipitation the soil in the watershed is mainly yellow brown earth and weathered sandy loam most of soil are low mountains and hilly land forms with open gullies and valleys of 464 600m above sea level the vegetation is slightly different in spatial distribution and the vegetation coverage on the slope is better with a coverage rate of more than 60 the lower slope is the residential area of villagers the slope is gentle and the damage to the original environment by farming activities is serious the common tree species in woodland types is pine the crop types of arable land are mainly wheat maize and peanuts and the grassland is mainly natural grasses the number of resident population in the small watershed is 830 and the population density is 446 people km2 industrial fertilizers account for a high proportion of fertilizer production and farmyard fertilizers are supplemented in small watersheds villagers directly discharge sewage or wash clothes everywhere severely polluting the water flow inside the watershed fig 2 2 2 research methods 2 2 1 monitoring point layout the runoff plots fig 3 a b d selected in this paper require approximately the same soil fertility and the natural conditions land use types production conditions and other social and economic conditions are representative in the local area the runoff plots is surrounded by concrete walls and a water storage tank is set at the bottom to facilitate the runoff formed in the area to be introduced into the water storage tank an internal tank fig 3c is set at the bottom of the water storage tank to facilitate the measurement and collection of runoff and to a certain extent the measurement accuracy is also increased before monitoring clean the water storage tank to ensure that the tank is dry and pollution free and monitoring points should also be set up at the outlet of the watershed therefore the selected monitoring points should be representative six runoff plots are selected in this study and the specific information of the runoff plots is shown in table 1 2 2 2 methods and monitoring in the small watershed a hobo meteorological station is set near the runoff plots fig 3e for all weather on site monitoring of atmospheric temperature relative humidity wind direction wind speed rainfall air pressure solar radiation and many other meteorological elements an automatic water level gauge was installed at the outlet of the river watershed to monitor the water level change of the outlet section in real time water samples were collected in the runoff plots meanwhile the runoff generated by natural precipitation was collected through a catch watershed fig 3d water samples are collected as soon as the runoff begins and sampling was carried out every 2 h shorten time step during heavy rain approximately 500 ml of water should be collected and the water level in the catchment tank should be recorded before each sampling with an accuracy of 0 1 cm the water samples from the outlet of the watershed were taken at intervals of 0 30 60 90 and 120 min from the time of rainfall with 500 ml per bottle until the runoff was basically restored to the original level concentrated sulfuric acid was added to the water sample to make the ph value of the water sample 2 and sent back to the laboratory for testing within 2 days while keeping the storage temperature below 4 c during the whole process the measurement indexes include total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp ammonia nitrogen nh3 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n and orthophosphate srp which are determined by alkaline potassium persulfate digestion uv spectrophotometry in water nessler s reagent spectrophotometry determinates nh3 n in water phenol disulfonic acid spectrophotometry determinates no3 n in water ammonium molybdate spectrophotometry determinates tp in water vanadium molybdate blue colorimetric method determinates srp in water finally the correlation of each index was analyzed by spss 26 software 2 2 3 calculation method 1 mean concentration method the flood season refers to the period when the water in the basin rises in the rainy season for example the rainy season in this area is mainly from june to november and the dry season refers to the period when there is little rainfall in the basin given that the load of non point source pollution is mainly carried by the surface runoff during the flood season the annual runoff process should be divided into two parts the surface runoff storm runoff base flow during the flood season and the runoff during the dry season the base flow in flood season can also be regarded as the runoff in dry season the area has less rainfall in dry season and non point source pollution rarely occurs therefore we believe that point source pollution is the main pollution mode in dry season the point source pollution load lp can be calculated as lp qpcp where qp is the measured dry season flow rate m3 s and cp is the measured dry season pollutant concentration mg l the total pollution load during the flood season is la qaca where qa is the flood season runoff m3 s and ca is the measured flood season pollutant concentration mg l then the non point source pollution load produced during the flood season is ln la lp the average concentration of non point source pollution of various pollutants in each rainstorm is first calculated according to the simultaneous monitoring data of water quantity and water quality of each rainfall runoff process then the runoff produced by each rainstorm is used as the weight to obtain the weighted mean concentration li 2000 the calculation formula for the average concentration of non point source pollution during a rainstorm runoff process is 1 c w l w a where wl is the load carried by the rainstorm g in grams the expression is 2 w l i 1 n q t i c i q p i c p i δ t i where wa is the runoff produced by the rainstorm m3 and the expression is 3 w a i 1 n q t i q p i δ t i where qti is the measured flow at ti m3 s ci is the measured pollutant concentration at ti mg l qpi is the discharge in the dry season at ti discharge not formed by this rainstorm m3 s cpi is the base current concentration at ti dry season concentration mg l i 1 2 n is the number of simultaneous monitoring of the discharge and water quality in the process of the rainstorm flow and ti is the duration of qti and ci and the expression is 4 δ t i t i 1 t i 1 2 then the weighted average concentration of non point source pollutants of multiple rainstorms such as m time is 5 c j 1 m c j w a j j 1 m w a j where c j is the jth average mass concentration of non point source pollutants mg l and waj is the runoff volume generated by the jth rainstorm 2 calculation of the relative loss in mass of fertilizers s12 bare land runoff plot is set as the reference plot the pollution loss per unit area in each plot is recorded as wx and the pollution loss per unit area of bare land plot is recorded as wb thus the pollutant reduction rate of the plot with different measures is determined as follows 6 η w b w x w b 100 3 results and discussion 3 1 analysis of the rainfall characteristics the runoff generated can be used to describe the nutrient loss in each runoff plot chen et al 2011 six typical rainfall events are selected in this monitoring the precipitation duration precipitation average rainfall intensity and 30 minute maximum rainfall intensity i30 were monitored respectively table 2 the rainfall is classified according to the rainfall within 24 h rainfall of less than 10 mm is classified as light rain rainfall of 10 25 mm is classified as moderate rain rainfall of 25 50 mm is classified as heavy rain rainfall of 50 100mm is classified as heavy rain table 2 illustrates that the six rainfall events include the main rainfall types in yingwugou watershed and provide a basis for the subsequent runoff calculation and non point source pollutant load calculation two rainstorms were monitored among the six rainfalls in 20 september 2020 the maximum rainfall reached 70 4 mm and the average rainfall intensity was 1 7 mm h however the heaviest rainfall intensity in 30 min was in 15 september 2019 reaching 4 2 mm and the longest duration reached was 58 h in summary when analyzing the loss of nutrients in each runoff plot the number of sampling could be added and the key analysis was made for such a rainfall plot with long duration and high rainfall 3 2 characteristics and flux of nutrient loss in the runoff plot 3 2 1 characteristics of nitrogen and phosphorus loss in the runoff plots under a single rainfall this work selected the rainfall on september 15 2019 for analysis to understand the loss characteristics of nitrogen and phosphorus under a single rainfall the characteristics of nitrogen and phosphorus losses are shown in figs 4 and 5 respectively in fig 4 with the generation of runoff the nitrogen concentration generally shows a trend of first increasing and then decreasing however the time for nitrogen concentration to reach the highest value in each runoff plot was different for example the maximum nitrogen concentrations in the s9 and s11 runoff plots occurred on the 14 16th hour of rainfall meanwhile the maximum nitrogen concentrations in s13 s19 and s20 occurred on the 18 20th hour of rainfall the analysis showed that peanut was planted in s9 with steep slope and maize was planted in s11 which was still in the growth period accordingly the nitrogen in the soil was washed out earlier in the two plots due to the fast runoff the other three plots had dense vegetation developed roots and had strong sand fixation ability hindering the rain from scouring the soil and the highest value of nitrogen concentration was produced later in the six runoff plots the nh3 n concentration was always maintained at a low value the no3 n concentration was kept at a high level and the change trend was similar to that of total nitrogen given that the ammonium ion in ammonium nitrogen was positively charged and easy to be adsorbed by soil particles its migration process was mainly affected by certain factors such as the content of soil clay and the saturation degree of ammonium nitrogen adsorption in addition the nh3 n loss in the surface runoff was far less than tn and no3 n losses this phenomenon occurred because nh3 n was transformed into a more easily lost form of no3 n with the participation of the soil nitrifying bacteria liu et al 2020 in fig 5 the whole process of phosphorus concentration change showed the same trend as nitrogen at the beginning of runoff production showing a trend of first increasing then decreasing and finally stabilizing s12 has the largest loss in each stage however the change of individual plots was obscured for example a little difference was observed in the change of srp concentration in s13 s19 and s20 the analysis showed that s12 was bare land and nutrients could be easily washed by runoff the s13 s19 and s20 plots were covered with vegetation reducing runoff erosion which further showed that land use types such as sweet potato grassland and orchard grassland play important roles in reducing phosphorus loss 3 2 2 characteristics of nitrogen and phosphorus loss in the runoff plots under different rainfall events 1 characteristics of nitrogen loss in the runoff plots under different rainfall events in this work the nitrogen loss per unit area was obtained from the nitrogen concentration detected under six typical rainfall events the loss of nitrogen under different rainfall land use and slope conditions were also analyzed fig 6 in fig 6 the minimum nitrogen loss occurred in the minimum rainfall on 17 june 2020 in the six plots meanwhile the maximum nitrogen loss occurred in the maximum rainfall on 20 september 2020 the nitrogen loss of the peanut plot in s9 was the largest in which the tn no3 n and nh3 n losses were 15 39 10 86 and 1 39 mg m2 respectively under different land use types the order of nitrogen loss was farmland grassland orchard the order of nitrogen loss in farmland was peanut maize sweet potatoes this situation occurred because the farmland had been ploughed all year round the soil structure was poor and the farmers applied fertilizer the nitrogen loss was significantly higher than those of the other land use types the sweet potato nitrogen loss was also less because the sweet potato root system was very boost and the branches and leaves were lush which plays a certain role in nitrogen fixation and reducing runoff scour chen et al 2021 the result of the comparison of the nh3 n and no3 n losses showed that nh3 n was far less than no3 n based on their chemical properties this result was consistent with guo s research results in this area guo et al 2014 according to the analysis of the different slopes the nitrogen loss of the peanut plot in s9 was the largest when compared with the nitrogen loss of the maize plot in s11 the former was twice as many as the latter li et al 2014 under the same slope the nitrogen loss was maize sweet potato grassland orchard 2 characteristics of phosphorus loss in different forms in the runoff plot the tp and srp loss per unit area was also obtained from the nitrogen concentration detected under six typical rainfall events fig 7 the nitrogen losses under different slope precipitation and land use conditions were compared in fig 7 the highest loss of srp and tp occurred in the field with precipitation of 70 4 mm and the lowest loss was observed in the field with rainfall of 13 4 mm under different land use types the phosphorus loss of farmland s9 and s11 was higher than that of orchard s19 and grassland s20 the loss of tp in farmland was the highest and the average loss of tp in farmland was 0 88 mg m2 which was about 12 5 times of that in orchard and 8 times of that in grassland therefore the loss of tp in farmland was significantly different from that in orchard and grassland when the slope of runoff plot is greater than 25 the flow velocity increases obviously which increases the interaction intensity between runoff and soil thus affecting the soil particle initiation erosion mode and sediment carrying capacity of runoff on the slope surface layer and thus increasing the nutrient loss xu et al 2013 in each runoff plot the loss degree of phosphorus was roughly similar to that of nitrogen and it had a great correlation with rainfall slope and land use the result of the comparison of the loss of srp and tp under the two rainfall events of 21 july and 20 september demonstrated that a large increase occurred on 20 september the investigation showed that farmers had applied chemical fertilizer during this period which was followed by heavy rainfall accordingly a large amount of nutrients were lost in a short period of time with the sudden increase of runoff during the fertilization season of crops and under the condition of heavy rainfall the result in this study was compatible with that of xu et al 2014 3 2 3 ratio of loss in precipitation with different forms of nitrogen and phosphorus the total loss of non point source substances under six rainfall events was counted to facilitate the analysis of the proportion of nitrogen and phosphorus in different forms of secondary precipitation loss in each community as shown in table 3 then the proportion of secondary precipitation loss with different forms of nitrogen and phosphorus was calculated fig 8 compared to the bare land plot the largest losses of nitrogen and phosphorus were in the peanut plot s12 table 3 the losses of nitrogen and phosphorus were 63 78 and 7 81 mg m2 respectively the lowest losses of tn 2 74 mg m2 and tp 0 43 mg m2 were found in s19 the total nitrogen loss was s12 s9 s11 s13 s20 s19 the tp loss was s12 s9 s11 s20 s13 s19 the phosphorus loss in s13 was almost the same as that in the grassland the tp loss of s13 was far less than those of s9 and s11 indicating that sweet potato plays an important role in nitrogen fixation and phosphorus fixation compared with peanut and maize because sweet potato was in the growth period at that time with dense leaves high coverage developed root system and strong sand fixation and water storage capacity when rainfall occurred its runoff production time was late and the pollutant concentration was low this result was broadly consistent with song s research results in the district song et al 2021 in fig 8 the ratio of the sum of nh3 n and no3 n to the total nitrogen in the five plots ranges from 65 2 to 84 0 accounting for more than 60 0 with the highest proportion appearing in s9 and s11 no3 n was the main nutrient the reason may be that no3 n was easily soluble in water and easily washed away when rainfall occurs chen et al 2021 in addition to s12 srp accounted for 62 3 81 3 of tp in the other five plots which was also more than 60 0 indicating that srp was the main nutrient of phosphorus in table 4 the highest reduction rate of nitrogen and phosphorus was in s19 orchard and the reduction rates of nh3 n no3 n other forms of nitrogen and tn were 85 3 95 2 97 2 and 95 1 respectively the reduction rates of srp other forms of phosphorus and tp were 92 0 95 6 and 93 3 respectively s20 grassland took the second place and the reduction effect of nitrogen and phosphorus was about 84 8 92 8 the worst reduction rate was in s9 peanut plot and the reduction effects of nitrogen and phosphorus were about 12 1 24 5 respectively under different land use conditions the best effect of nutrient reduction was orchard grassland sweet potato maize peanut compared with guo s previous research that is grassland maize peanut combination the results were consistent guo et al 2014 according to the above analysis improving the planting mode reducing the planting of high slope farmland and appropriately returning farmland to orchard can play an effective role in the control of non point source pollution in the research area xu et al 2014 3 2 4 correlation analysis of each runoff plot this work used spss26 software to determine the spearman s correlation coefficient for the different runoff plots to further study the correlation between rainfall runoff and runoff pollution table 5 in table 5 the rainfall runoff of each runoff plot was significantly correlated indicating that the main cause of runoff was related to rainfall the correlations at the level of the 0 01 confidence interval were all above 0 771 and the correlations were s20 and s19 s13 s11 s9 in particular the correlation between the s19 and the s20 runoff plots were above 0 943 while that between the s9 and the s11 runoff plots were relatively low the reason may be that the two runoff plots were farmland which was related to the greater human interference factors in terms of runoff and the loss of various forms of nitrogen and phosphorus a certain correlation exists between runoff and various nutrients the s9 runoff plot had the best correlation for srp reaching 0 772 the s19 plot had the best correlation for tp reaching 0 928 the s9 and s11 had the best correlation for nh3 n reaching 0 943 showing a significant correlation s20 had the best correlation for no3 n reaching 0 943 the s20 runoff plot had the best correlation for tp reaching 0 998 the reason for this phenomenon was due to the different types of land use in each runoff plot 3 3 analysis of the characteristics of nutrient in the small watershed 3 3 1 runoff change process under typical rainfall events this work selected four typical rainfall events that occurred on 11 july 2020 21 july 2020 13 august 2020 and 21 september 2020 to analyze the relationship between rainfall and runoff fig 9 fig 7 demonstrates a relationship between rainfall and runoff the runoff increased first and then decreased with the increase in rainfall duration which was the standard runoff process during the precipitation process a relationship can be observed between rainfall and total outflow and a certain lag in surface runoff was evident this phenomenon is related to the effective vegetation coverage and soil water holding capacity of the yingwugou watershed the runoff processes that occurred on 11 july 2020 and 21 july 2020 had single peak curves with peak values of 0 048 and 0 049 m3 s respectively the reason was the short rainfall duration and small rainfall on 11 july 2020 the peak of hourly rainfall appeared in the first half of the whole rainfall process for the typical rainfall on 21 july 2020 then the peak of hourly rainfall showed a gradually decreasing trend the runoff processes that occurred on 13 august 2020 and 21 september 2020 showed obvious bimodal curves with the maximum peaks of 0 039 and 0 053 m3 s respectively this result was due the two distinct peak processes of rainfall 3 3 2 characteristics of nitrogen and phosphorus loss at the outlet of the small watershed under a single rainfall the monitored rainfall on july 21 2020 was used to analyze the change process of the nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations at the outlet of the small watershed with runoff in fig 10 a the tp and srp concentrations sharply increased with the increase in flow then gradually decreased and finally stabilized the tp and srp concentrations rapidly increased from 0 144 and 0 108 mg l before rainfall to the maximum values of 0 312 and 0 252 mg l respectively in fig 10 b the change trend of the nitrogen concentration was consistent with that of phosphorus but a huge difference in values was observed the maximum tn no3 n and nh3 n concentrations reached 6 72 3 76 and 0 804 mg l respectively the content of nh3 n differed by an order of magnitude compared with that of no3 n indicating that nitrogen pollutants in small watersheds in this area existed in the form of no3 n in fig 10 a and b the maximum phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations appeared before the maximum runoff with the progress of rainfall according to the analysis fig 9 shows that the rainfall of 7 21 was mainly concentrated in the upper half of the whole rainfall process during this period the rainfall was large and the surface was rapidly scoured at this time the shallow nutrients on the surface are easy to scour into the river resulting in the sharp rise of pollutants in the river 3 3 3 analysis of runoff yield in the small watershed the average monthly discharge and monthly runoff yield were calculated based on the monitoring data of the water level at the outlet of the watershed in 2020 table 6 table 6 illustrates that the maximum average monthly discharge in yingwugou small watershed was 0 019 m3 s in july and the minimum was 0 002 m3 s in january and february the total runoff yield in 2020 was 288 835 m3 the calculated runoff was approximately the same as the xu s previous study xu et al 2013 the flood season mainly concentrated in june to november and the runoff yield was 214531 m3 accounting for 74 27 of the total annual runoff the dry season occurred in january february and december and the runoff yield was 18749 m3 accounting for 6 49 of the total annual runoff the normal period appeared in march april and may with a total runoff yield of 55 555m3 the average flow in the dry season was 0 0025 m3 s which can be used as the annual average base flow and the annual point source runoff yield was 78 840 m3 therefore the annual runoff yield of non point source pollution was 209 995m3 3 3 4 analysis of pollutant yield in the small watershed the runoff in the dry season was formed by the surface and soil runoff flowing through the farmland but it was different from the surface runoff generated by the rainfall in the flood season accordingly the runoff in the dry season was taken as the point source pollution in this study first the non point source pollution load wl under each rainfall event was calculated by using formula 2 then the runoff yield by each rainfall event was estimated by using formula 3 subsequently the mean concentration of non point source pollution under each rainfall event was obtained by using formula 1 finally the weighted mean concentration of non point source pollution under multiple rainfall events was obtained by using formula 5 the mean concentration of point source pollution was approximately equal to the mean concentration of pollutants in the dry season the mean concentrations of non point source pollution and point source pollution are shown in table 7 the point and non point source concentrations of each nutrient were calculated together with the point source runoff and non point source annual runoff the point source and non point source load of each nutrient in the watershed are estimated the results are shown in table 8 in table 8 the losses of non point source pollution in yingwugou small watershed from january 2020 to december 2020 were 41 77 kg km2 nh3 n 296 93 kg km2 no3 n 494 51 kg km2 tn 33 87 kg km2 srp and 44 03 kg km2 tp the contribution index of the pollution load was tn no3 n nh3 n tp srp the non point sources of the five nutrients accounted for more than 75 among which the highest srp was 88 88 the lowest nh3 n was 77 27 and the higher tp was 85 23 the reasons for the high proportion of non point source pollution were as follows first a large amount of farmland was distributed on both sides of the watershed and the vast portion of agricultural real estate flow and soil erosion resulted in the most serious non point source pollution of farmland secondly the distribution of villages in the watershed resulted in the serious non point source pollution due to the random discharge of rural household garbage and sewage from breeding industry in the analysis of nitrogen from non point source pollution no3 n accounted for 59 4 of tn and nh3 n accounted for 8 6 of tn this phenomenon was due to the strong nitrification in the soil surface and the mass concentration of no3 n was high and negatively charged which was difficult to be adsorbed by soil particles while nh3 n was easily adsorbed consequently no3 n was easily washed away by runoff when rainfall occurs this phenomenon also explained why no3 n flux in the watershed was much larger than that of nh3 n song et al 2021 in the non point source pollution phosphorus analysis the srp flux accounted for about 77 8 of tp accordingly srp was the main non point source pollution of phosphorus forms and after entering water srp was directly utilized by plants bacteria and algae in the water which was the main form of phosphorus causing eutrophication of water bodies lv et al 2019 therefore when controlling the loss of nitrogen and phosphorus more attention should be paid to the loss of no3 n and srp and the prevention control and research should be strengthened 4 conclusion rainfall runoff was the main driving force of nutrient loss the pollutant concentration in the runoff plot increased first and then decreased with the rainfall time under a single rainfall taking s12 as the control group the best reduction rate was orchard grassland sweet potato maize peanut the pollutant concentrations sharply increased with the increase in flow then gradually decreased and finally stabilized at the outlet of the small watershed under a single rainfall a relationship between the rainfall and the total discharge was evident and the surface runoff had a certain lag which was related to the effective vegetation cover and soil water holding capacity in yingwugou small watershed the flood season was the main runoff producing period which accounted for 74 3 of the total annual runoff non point source pollution accounted for more than 75 of the five monitoring indicators non point source pollution was the main pollution in the watershed no3 n accounted for 59 4 of tn and was the main form of nitrogen pollution srp accounted for about 77 8 of tp and was the main form pollution of phosphorus the application of agricultural fertilizer and rainfall scour are the main causes of runoff pollution in the small watershed hence the management measures of agricultural activities must be adjusted according to the forecast of the meteorological department and tillage should be avoided before the frequent periods of extreme events of short duration heavy rainfall fertilization was an effective way to control nutrient loss and reduce agricultural non point source pollution the soil and water conservation tillage method and and fertilization system must be studied and promoted through the optimal allocation of land use types to effectively mitigate runoff pollution for example avoid cultivation on 30 slopes appropriately reduce the planting area of peanuts and increase the planting area of sweet potatoes and to organize cultivation in the watershed space to create buffer zones mosaic of cultivated and non cultivated spaces and the development of terraced planting that can reduce soil erosion and promote rainwater infiltration these conclusions can provide some scientific basis for non point source pollution control and water environment

for water quality control and management the nutrient loss characteristics load and reduction rate of nutrients under different land use types were analyzed through the runoff plot monitoring experiment and the non point source pollution load in the watershed was further calculated results showed that the loss of nutrients in each runoff plot was farmland grassland orchard in each runoff plot under the same slope the loss of nutrient performance was maize sweet potato grassland orchard taking s12 as the control group the best reduction rate was orchard grassland sweet potato maize peanut in runoff plot the pollutant concentration under a single rainfall increased first and then decreased with the rainfall time the pollutant concentrations sharply increased with the increase in flow then gradually decreased and finally stabilized at the outlet of the small watershed under a single rainfall at this time the shallow nutrients on the surface were easy to scour into the river resulting in the sharp rise of pollutants in the river in 2020 the losses of ammonia nitrogen nh3 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n total nitrogen tn orthophosphate srp and total phosphorus tp in the basin were 41 77 296 93 494 51 33 87 and 44 03 kg km2 respectively tn and tp were the primary nutrients in this area the research results can provide a reference for the study of non point source pollution

components and various types hao et al 2018 hou et al 2020 the pollution sources include surface runoff pollution soil erosion fertilizers and pesticides rural domestic sewage and livestock and poultry manure non point source pollution comes from non specific and scattered areas and the boundaries and locations are difficult to determine du et al 2014 wang et al 2021 the characteristics of non point source pollution include randomness complex causes and long latency non point source pollution has become the main source of water environmental pollution in recent years with the improvement of the level of point source pollution control qian et al 2021 fu et al 2021 load source analysis and research of migration and transformation for non point source pollution are not only an important research content in the field of river basin water resources and water environment but also the basis and prerequisite for the reasonable assessment and water quality planning geng et al 2014 sui et al 2020 the non point source pollution in china is also quite serious the other problem is the large scale application of fertilizers pesticides and other agricultural chemicals in agricultural activities a small portion of chemicals is absorbed by crops and the rest remains in the soil fang 2021 when it rains these chemicals are washed into the river and becomes a potential source of pollution liu et al 2020 at present most researches on non point source pollution focus on large rivers and the load calculation and control are mainly carried out through software simulation choi et al 2021 zheng et al 2021 however few studies have been conducted on the characteristics and mechanism of non point source pollution loss through field monitoring experiments in small watersheds zhang et al 2017 li et al 2021 how to clarify the characteristics of non point source pollution the mechanism of migration and transformation and the relationship between surface runoff pollutant generation and runoff pollution intensity in the runoff process has become an important scientific issue facing this research zhou et al 2021 lou et al 2020 yan and lu 2020 this concern has gradually developed into a mainstream trend to environmental problems with the deepening of understanding of water wading issues rainfall runoff landform land use type and vegetation cover affect the development of agricultural non point source pollution to varying degrees yang et al 2021 qian et al 2021 in this region the characteristics of nitrogen and phosphorus loss in slope runoff are studied based on artificial rainfall xu et al 2013 yin et al 2007 found that the rainfall kinetic energy and erosion force generated by the rainfall simulator were much lower than those of natural rainfall at present the research on non point source pollution in small watershed mostly focuses on the characteristics of runoff and water and soil loss the distribution characteristics of nitrogen and phosphorus simulated by models and the output characteristics of soil nutrients in sediment wang et al 2022 liao et al 2021 however it is rare to analyze the loss characteristics of nitrogen and phosphorus through high frequency field monitoring in particular the analysis of nitrogen and phosphorus loss characteristics of crops in the process of rainfall under different land use forms is rarely involved this work selected different typical runoff plots such as farmland orchard and grassland based on six typical natural rainfall continuously monitored from 2019 to 2020 based on the field observation data of the yingwugou small watershed in danjiang water source area the effects of rainfall slope land use type and vegetation cover on soil and water loss and nutrient loss were analyzed and the annual load of non point source pollution in this area was calculated by mean concentration method to provide basis for the non point source pollution control in the danjiang river basin the objectives of this work are as follows i to analyze the characteristics of nitrogen and phosphorus loss in the runoff plot ii to perform a correlation analysis of rainfall runoff and runoff pollution in the runoff plots and iii to analyze the characteristics of nitrogen and phosphorus loss at the outlet of the small watershed 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this article selected yingwugou small watershed as the research area which is located in wulipu village chengguan town southeast of shangnan county shangluo city shaanxi province northwest of china fig 1 the watershed is located at e110 52 16 110 55 30 and n33 29 55 33 33 50 the total area of the watershed is 1 86 km2 of which the orchard grassland and farmland areas are 0 52 0 17 and 1 12 km2 respectively this area is a transitional zone between the northern subtropical and the warm temperate zones with plenty of sunshine and four distinct seasons the distribution of precipitation during the year is particularly uneven the average annual precipitation is 803 2 mm and the rainfall is mostly heavy the precipitation from july to september accounts for about 50 of the annual precipitation the soil in the watershed is mainly yellow brown earth and weathered sandy loam most of soil are low mountains and hilly land forms with open gullies and valleys of 464 600m above sea level the vegetation is slightly different in spatial distribution and the vegetation coverage on the slope is better with a coverage rate of more than 60 the lower slope is the residential area of villagers the slope is gentle and the damage to the original environment by farming activities is serious the common tree species in woodland types is pine the crop types of arable land are mainly wheat maize and peanuts and the grassland is mainly natural grasses the number of resident population in the small watershed is 830 and the population density is 446 people km2 industrial fertilizers account for a high proportion of fertilizer production and farmyard fertilizers are supplemented in small watersheds villagers directly discharge sewage or wash clothes everywhere severely polluting the water flow inside the watershed fig 2 2 2 research methods 2 2 1 monitoring point layout the runoff plots fig 3 a b d selected in this paper require approximately the same soil fertility and the natural conditions land use types production conditions and other social and economic conditions are representative in the local area the runoff plots is surrounded by concrete walls and a water storage tank is set at the bottom to facilitate the runoff formed in the area to be introduced into the water storage tank an internal tank fig 3c is set at the bottom of the water storage tank to facilitate the measurement and collection of runoff and to a certain extent the measurement accuracy is also increased before monitoring clean the water storage tank to ensure that the tank is dry and pollution free and monitoring points should also be set up at the outlet of the watershed therefore the selected monitoring points should be representative six runoff plots are selected in this study and the specific information of the runoff plots is shown in table 1 2 2 2 methods and monitoring in the small watershed a hobo meteorological station is set near the runoff plots fig 3e for all weather on site monitoring of atmospheric temperature relative humidity wind direction wind speed rainfall air pressure solar radiation and many other meteorological elements an automatic water level gauge was installed at the outlet of the river watershed to monitor the water level change of the outlet section in real time water samples were collected in the runoff plots meanwhile the runoff generated by natural precipitation was collected through a catch watershed fig 3d water samples are collected as soon as the runoff begins and sampling was carried out every 2 h shorten time step during heavy rain approximately 500 ml of water should be collected and the water level in the catchment tank should be recorded before each sampling with an accuracy of 0 1 cm the water samples from the outlet of the watershed were taken at intervals of 0 30 60 90 and 120 min from the time of rainfall with 500 ml per bottle until the runoff was basically restored to the original level concentrated sulfuric acid was added to the water sample to make the ph value of the water sample 2 and sent back to the laboratory for testing within 2 days while keeping the storage temperature below 4 c during the whole process the measurement indexes include total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp ammonia nitrogen nh3 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n and orthophosphate srp which are determined by alkaline potassium persulfate digestion uv spectrophotometry in water nessler s reagent spectrophotometry determinates nh3 n in water phenol disulfonic acid spectrophotometry determinates no3 n in water ammonium molybdate spectrophotometry determinates tp in water vanadium molybdate blue colorimetric method determinates srp in water finally the correlation of each index was analyzed by spss 26 software 2 2 3 calculation method 1 mean concentration method the flood season refers to the period when the water in the basin rises in the rainy season for example the rainy season in this area is mainly from june to november and the dry season refers to the period when there is little rainfall in the basin given that the load of non point source pollution is mainly carried by the surface runoff during the flood season the annual runoff process should be divided into two parts the surface runoff storm runoff base flow during the flood season and the runoff during the dry season the base flow in flood season can also be regarded as the runoff in dry season the area has less rainfall in dry season and non point source pollution rarely occurs therefore we believe that point source pollution is the main pollution mode in dry season the point source pollution load lp can be calculated as lp qpcp where qp is the measured dry season flow rate m3 s and cp is the measured dry season pollutant concentration mg l the total pollution load during the flood season is la qaca where qa is the flood season runoff m3 s and ca is the measured flood season pollutant concentration mg l then the non point source pollution load produced during the flood season is ln la lp the average concentration of non point source pollution of various pollutants in each rainstorm is first calculated according to the simultaneous monitoring data of water quantity and water quality of each rainfall runoff process then the runoff produced by each rainstorm is used as the weight to obtain the weighted mean concentration li 2000 the calculation formula for the average concentration of non point source pollution during a rainstorm runoff process is 1 c w l w a where wl is the load carried by the rainstorm g in grams the expression is 2 w l i 1 n q t i c i q p i c p i δ t i where wa is the runoff produced by the rainstorm m3 and the expression is 3 w a i 1 n q t i q p i δ t i where qti is the measured flow at ti m3 s ci is the measured pollutant concentration at ti mg l qpi is the discharge in the dry season at ti discharge not formed by this rainstorm m3 s cpi is the base current concentration at ti dry season concentration mg l i 1 2 n is the number of simultaneous monitoring of the discharge and water quality in the process of the rainstorm flow and ti is the duration of qti and ci and the expression is 4 δ t i t i 1 t i 1 2 then the weighted average concentration of non point source pollutants of multiple rainstorms such as m time is 5 c j 1 m c j w a j j 1 m w a j where c j is the jth average mass concentration of non point source pollutants mg l and waj is the runoff volume generated by the jth rainstorm 2 calculation of the relative loss in mass of fertilizers s12 bare land runoff plot is set as the reference plot the pollution loss per unit area in each plot is recorded as wx and the pollution loss per unit area of bare land plot is recorded as wb thus the pollutant reduction rate of the plot with different measures is determined as follows 6 η w b w x w b 100 3 results and discussion 3 1 analysis of the rainfall characteristics the runoff generated can be used to describe the nutrient loss in each runoff plot chen et al 2011 six typical rainfall events are selected in this monitoring the precipitation duration precipitation average rainfall intensity and 30 minute maximum rainfall intensity i30 were monitored respectively table 2 the rainfall is classified according to the rainfall within 24 h rainfall of less than 10 mm is classified as light rain rainfall of 10 25 mm is classified as moderate rain rainfall of 25 50 mm is classified as heavy rain rainfall of 50 100mm is classified as heavy rain table 2 illustrates that the six rainfall events include the main rainfall types in yingwugou watershed and provide a basis for the subsequent runoff calculation and non point source pollutant load calculation two rainstorms were monitored among the six rainfalls in 20 september 2020 the maximum rainfall reached 70 4 mm and the average rainfall intensity was 1 7 mm h however the heaviest rainfall intensity in 30 min was in 15 september 2019 reaching 4 2 mm and the longest duration reached was 58 h in summary when analyzing the loss of nutrients in each runoff plot the number of sampling could be added and the key analysis was made for such a rainfall plot with long duration and high rainfall 3 2 characteristics and flux of nutrient loss in the runoff plot 3 2 1 characteristics of nitrogen and phosphorus loss in the runoff plots under a single rainfall this work selected the rainfall on september 15 2019 for analysis to understand the loss characteristics of nitrogen and phosphorus under a single rainfall the characteristics of nitrogen and phosphorus losses are shown in figs 4 and 5 respectively in fig 4 with the generation of runoff the nitrogen concentration generally shows a trend of first increasing and then decreasing however the time for nitrogen concentration to reach the highest value in each runoff plot was different for example the maximum nitrogen concentrations in the s9 and s11 runoff plots occurred on the 14 16th hour of rainfall meanwhile the maximum nitrogen concentrations in s13 s19 and s20 occurred on the 18 20th hour of rainfall the analysis showed that peanut was planted in s9 with steep slope and maize was planted in s11 which was still in the growth period accordingly the nitrogen in the soil was washed out earlier in the two plots due to the fast runoff the other three plots had dense vegetation developed roots and had strong sand fixation ability hindering the rain from scouring the soil and the highest value of nitrogen concentration was produced later in the six runoff plots the nh3 n concentration was always maintained at a low value the no3 n concentration was kept at a high level and the change trend was similar to that of total nitrogen given that the ammonium ion in ammonium nitrogen was positively charged and easy to be adsorbed by soil particles its migration process was mainly affected by certain factors such as the content of soil clay and the saturation degree of ammonium nitrogen adsorption in addition the nh3 n loss in the surface runoff was far less than tn and no3 n losses this phenomenon occurred because nh3 n was transformed into a more easily lost form of no3 n with the participation of the soil nitrifying bacteria liu et al 2020 in fig 5 the whole process of phosphorus concentration change showed the same trend as nitrogen at the beginning of runoff production showing a trend of first increasing then decreasing and finally stabilizing s12 has the largest loss in each stage however the change of individual plots was obscured for example a little difference was observed in the change of srp concentration in s13 s19 and s20 the analysis showed that s12 was bare land and nutrients could be easily washed by runoff the s13 s19 and s20 plots were covered with vegetation reducing runoff erosion which further showed that land use types such as sweet potato grassland and orchard grassland play important roles in reducing phosphorus loss 3 2 2 characteristics of nitrogen and phosphorus loss in the runoff plots under different rainfall events 1 characteristics of nitrogen loss in the runoff plots under different rainfall events in this work the nitrogen loss per unit area was obtained from the nitrogen concentration detected under six typical rainfall events the loss of nitrogen under different rainfall land use and slope conditions were also analyzed fig 6 in fig 6 the minimum nitrogen loss occurred in the minimum rainfall on 17 june 2020 in the six plots meanwhile the maximum nitrogen loss occurred in the maximum rainfall on 20 september 2020 the nitrogen loss of the peanut plot in s9 was the largest in which the tn no3 n and nh3 n losses were 15 39 10 86 and 1 39 mg m2 respectively under different land use types the order of nitrogen loss was farmland grassland orchard the order of nitrogen loss in farmland was peanut maize sweet potatoes this situation occurred because the farmland had been ploughed all year round the soil structure was poor and the farmers applied fertilizer the nitrogen loss was significantly higher than those of the other land use types the sweet potato nitrogen loss was also less because the sweet potato root system was very boost and the branches and leaves were lush which plays a certain role in nitrogen fixation and reducing runoff scour chen et al 2021 the result of the comparison of the nh3 n and no3 n losses showed that nh3 n was far less than no3 n based on their chemical properties this result was consistent with guo s research results in this area guo et al 2014 according to the analysis of the different slopes the nitrogen loss of the peanut plot in s9 was the largest when compared with the nitrogen loss of the maize plot in s11 the former was twice as many as the latter li et al 2014 under the same slope the nitrogen loss was maize sweet potato grassland orchard 2 characteristics of phosphorus loss in different forms in the runoff plot the tp and srp loss per unit area was also obtained from the nitrogen concentration detected under six typical rainfall events fig 7 the nitrogen losses under different slope precipitation and land use conditions were compared in fig 7 the highest loss of srp and tp occurred in the field with precipitation of 70 4 mm and the lowest loss was observed in the field with rainfall of 13 4 mm under different land use types the phosphorus loss of farmland s9 and s11 was higher than that of orchard s19 and grassland s20 the loss of tp in farmland was the highest and the average loss of tp in farmland was 0 88 mg m2 which was about 12 5 times of that in orchard and 8 times of that in grassland therefore the loss of tp in farmland was significantly different from that in orchard and grassland when the slope of runoff plot is greater than 25 the flow velocity increases obviously which increases the interaction intensity between runoff and soil thus affecting the soil particle initiation erosion mode and sediment carrying capacity of runoff on the slope surface layer and thus increasing the nutrient loss xu et al 2013 in each runoff plot the loss degree of phosphorus was roughly similar to that of nitrogen and it had a great correlation with rainfall slope and land use the result of the comparison of the loss of srp and tp under the two rainfall events of 21 july and 20 september demonstrated that a large increase occurred on 20 september the investigation showed that farmers had applied chemical fertilizer during this period which was followed by heavy rainfall accordingly a large amount of nutrients were lost in a short period of time with the sudden increase of runoff during the fertilization season of crops and under the condition of heavy rainfall the result in this study was compatible with that of xu et al 2014 3 2 3 ratio of loss in precipitation with different forms of nitrogen and phosphorus the total loss of non point source substances under six rainfall events was counted to facilitate the analysis of the proportion of nitrogen and phosphorus in different forms of secondary precipitation loss in each community as shown in table 3 then the proportion of secondary precipitation loss with different forms of nitrogen and phosphorus was calculated fig 8 compared to the bare land plot the largest losses of nitrogen and phosphorus were in the peanut plot s12 table 3 the losses of nitrogen and phosphorus were 63 78 and 7 81 mg m2 respectively the lowest losses of tn 2 74 mg m2 and tp 0 43 mg m2 were found in s19 the total nitrogen loss was s12 s9 s11 s13 s20 s19 the tp loss was s12 s9 s11 s20 s13 s19 the phosphorus loss in s13 was almost the same as that in the grassland the tp loss of s13 was far less than those of s9 and s11 indicating that sweet potato plays an important role in nitrogen fixation and phosphorus fixation compared with peanut and maize because sweet potato was in the growth period at that time with dense leaves high coverage developed root system and strong sand fixation and water storage capacity when rainfall occurred its runoff production time was late and the pollutant concentration was low this result was broadly consistent with song s research results in the district song et al 2021 in fig 8 the ratio of the sum of nh3 n and no3 n to the total nitrogen in the five plots ranges from 65 2 to 84 0 accounting for more than 60 0 with the highest proportion appearing in s9 and s11 no3 n was the main nutrient the reason may be that no3 n was easily soluble in water and easily washed away when rainfall occurs chen et al 2021 in addition to s12 srp accounted for 62 3 81 3 of tp in the other five plots which was also more than 60 0 indicating that srp was the main nutrient of phosphorus in table 4 the highest reduction rate of nitrogen and phosphorus was in s19 orchard and the reduction rates of nh3 n no3 n other forms of nitrogen and tn were 85 3 95 2 97 2 and 95 1 respectively the reduction rates of srp other forms of phosphorus and tp were 92 0 95 6 and 93 3 respectively s20 grassland took the second place and the reduction effect of nitrogen and phosphorus was about 84 8 92 8 the worst reduction rate was in s9 peanut plot and the reduction effects of nitrogen and phosphorus were about 12 1 24 5 respectively under different land use conditions the best effect of nutrient reduction was orchard grassland sweet potato maize peanut compared with guo s previous research that is grassland maize peanut combination the results were consistent guo et al 2014 according to the above analysis improving the planting mode reducing the planting of high slope farmland and appropriately returning farmland to orchard can play an effective role in the control of non point source pollution in the research area xu et al 2014 3 2 4 correlation analysis of each runoff plot this work used spss26 software to determine the spearman s correlation coefficient for the different runoff plots to further study the correlation between rainfall runoff and runoff pollution table 5 in table 5 the rainfall runoff of each runoff plot was significantly correlated indicating that the main cause of runoff was related to rainfall the correlations at the level of the 0 01 confidence interval were all above 0 771 and the correlations were s20 and s19 s13 s11 s9 in particular the correlation between the s19 and the s20 runoff plots were above 0 943 while that between the s9 and the s11 runoff plots were relatively low the reason may be that the two runoff plots were farmland which was related to the greater human interference factors in terms of runoff and the loss of various forms of nitrogen and phosphorus a certain correlation exists between runoff and various nutrients the s9 runoff plot had the best correlation for srp reaching 0 772 the s19 plot had the best correlation for tp reaching 0 928 the s9 and s11 had the best correlation for nh3 n reaching 0 943 showing a significant correlation s20 had the best correlation for no3 n reaching 0 943 the s20 runoff plot had the best correlation for tp reaching 0 998 the reason for this phenomenon was due to the different types of land use in each runoff plot 3 3 analysis of the characteristics of nutrient in the small watershed 3 3 1 runoff change process under typical rainfall events this work selected four typical rainfall events that occurred on 11 july 2020 21 july 2020 13 august 2020 and 21 september 2020 to analyze the relationship between rainfall and runoff fig 9 fig 7 demonstrates a relationship between rainfall and runoff the runoff increased first and then decreased with the increase in rainfall duration which was the standard runoff process during the precipitation process a relationship can be observed between rainfall and total outflow and a certain lag in surface runoff was evident this phenomenon is related to the effective vegetation coverage and soil water holding capacity of the yingwugou watershed the runoff processes that occurred on 11 july 2020 and 21 july 2020 had single peak curves with peak values of 0 048 and 0 049 m3 s respectively the reason was the short rainfall duration and small rainfall on 11 july 2020 the peak of hourly rainfall appeared in the first half of the whole rainfall process for the typical rainfall on 21 july 2020 then the peak of hourly rainfall showed a gradually decreasing trend the runoff processes that occurred on 13 august 2020 and 21 september 2020 showed obvious bimodal curves with the maximum peaks of 0 039 and 0 053 m3 s respectively this result was due the two distinct peak processes of rainfall 3 3 2 characteristics of nitrogen and phosphorus loss at the outlet of the small watershed under a single rainfall the monitored rainfall on july 21 2020 was used to analyze the change process of the nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations at the outlet of the small watershed with runoff in fig 10 a the tp and srp concentrations sharply increased with the increase in flow then gradually decreased and finally stabilized the tp and srp concentrations rapidly increased from 0 144 and 0 108 mg l before rainfall to the maximum values of 0 312 and 0 252 mg l respectively in fig 10 b the change trend of the nitrogen concentration was consistent with that of phosphorus but a huge difference in values was observed the maximum tn no3 n and nh3 n concentrations reached 6 72 3 76 and 0 804 mg l respectively the content of nh3 n differed by an order of magnitude compared with that of no3 n indicating that nitrogen pollutants in small watersheds in this area existed in the form of no3 n in fig 10 a and b the maximum phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations appeared before the maximum runoff with the progress of rainfall according to the analysis fig 9 shows that the rainfall of 7 21 was mainly concentrated in the upper half of the whole rainfall process during this period the rainfall was large and the surface was rapidly scoured at this time the shallow nutrients on the surface are easy to scour into the river resulting in the sharp rise of pollutants in the river 3 3 3 analysis of runoff yield in the small watershed the average monthly discharge and monthly runoff yield were calculated based on the monitoring data of the water level at the outlet of the watershed in 2020 table 6 table 6 illustrates that the maximum average monthly discharge in yingwugou small watershed was 0 019 m3 s in july and the minimum was 0 002 m3 s in january and february the total runoff yield in 2020 was 288 835 m3 the calculated runoff was approximately the same as the xu s previous study xu et al 2013 the flood season mainly concentrated in june to november and the runoff yield was 214531 m3 accounting for 74 27 of the total annual runoff the dry season occurred in january february and december and the runoff yield was 18749 m3 accounting for 6 49 of the total annual runoff the normal period appeared in march april and may with a total runoff yield of 55 555m3 the average flow in the dry season was 0 0025 m3 s which can be used as the annual average base flow and the annual point source runoff yield was 78 840 m3 therefore the annual runoff yield of non point source pollution was 209 995m3 3 3 4 analysis of pollutant yield in the small watershed the runoff in the dry season was formed by the surface and soil runoff flowing through the farmland but it was different from the surface runoff generated by the rainfall in the flood season accordingly the runoff in the dry season was taken as the point source pollution in this study first the non point source pollution load wl under each rainfall event was calculated by using formula 2 then the runoff yield by each rainfall event was estimated by using formula 3 subsequently the mean concentration of non point source pollution under each rainfall event was obtained by using formula 1 finally the weighted mean concentration of non point source pollution under multiple rainfall events was obtained by using formula 5 the mean concentration of point source pollution was approximately equal to the mean concentration of pollutants in the dry season the mean concentrations of non point source pollution and point source pollution are shown in table 7 the point and non point source concentrations of each nutrient were calculated together with the point source runoff and non point source annual runoff the point source and non point source load of each nutrient in the watershed are estimated the results are shown in table 8 in table 8 the losses of non point source pollution in yingwugou small watershed from january 2020 to december 2020 were 41 77 kg km2 nh3 n 296 93 kg km2 no3 n 494 51 kg km2 tn 33 87 kg km2 srp and 44 03 kg km2 tp the contribution index of the pollution load was tn no3 n nh3 n tp srp the non point sources of the five nutrients accounted for more than 75 among which the highest srp was 88 88 the lowest nh3 n was 77 27 and the higher tp was 85 23 the reasons for the high proportion of non point source pollution were as follows first a large amount of farmland was distributed on both sides of the watershed and the vast portion of agricultural real estate flow and soil erosion resulted in the most serious non point source pollution of farmland secondly the distribution of villages in the watershed resulted in the serious non point source pollution due to the random discharge of rural household garbage and sewage from breeding industry in the analysis of nitrogen from non point source pollution no3 n accounted for 59 4 of tn and nh3 n accounted for 8 6 of tn this phenomenon was due to the strong nitrification in the soil surface and the mass concentration of no3 n was high and negatively charged which was difficult to be adsorbed by soil particles while nh3 n was easily adsorbed consequently no3 n was easily washed away by runoff when rainfall occurs this phenomenon also explained why no3 n flux in the watershed was much larger than that of nh3 n song et al 2021 in the non point source pollution phosphorus analysis the srp flux accounted for about 77 8 of tp accordingly srp was the main non point source pollution of phosphorus forms and after entering water srp was directly utilized by plants bacteria and algae in the water which was the main form of phosphorus causing eutrophication of water bodies lv et al 2019 therefore when controlling the loss of nitrogen and phosphorus more attention should be paid to the loss of no3 n and srp and the prevention control and research should be strengthened 4 conclusion rainfall runoff was the main driving force of nutrient loss the pollutant concentration in the runoff plot increased first and then decreased with the rainfall time under a single rainfall taking s12 as the control group the best reduction rate was orchard grassland sweet potato maize peanut the pollutant concentrations sharply increased with the increase in flow then gradually decreased and finally stabilized at the outlet of the small watershed under a single rainfall a relationship between the rainfall and the total discharge was evident and the surface runoff had a certain lag which was related to the effective vegetation cover and soil water holding capacity in yingwugou small watershed the flood season was the main runoff producing period which accounted for 74 3 of the total annual runoff non point source pollution accounted for more than 75 of the five monitoring indicators non point source pollution was the main pollution in the watershed no3 n accounted for 59 4 of tn and was the main form of nitrogen pollution srp accounted for about 77 8 of tp and was the main form pollution of phosphorus the application of agricultural fertilizer and rainfall scour are the main causes of runoff pollution in the small watershed hence the management measures of agricultural activities must be adjusted according to the forecast of the meteorological department and tillage should be avoided before the frequent periods of extreme events of short duration heavy rainfall fertilization was an effective way to control nutrient loss and reduce agricultural non point source pollution the soil and water conservation tillage method and and fertilization system must be studied and promoted through the optimal allocation of land use types to effectively mitigate runoff pollution for example avoid cultivation on 30 slopes appropriately reduce the planting area of peanuts and increase the planting area of sweet potatoes and to organize cultivation in the watershed space to create buffer zones mosaic of cultivated and non cultivated spaces and the development of terraced planting that can reduce soil erosion and promote rainwater infiltration these conclusions can provide some scientific basis for non point source pollution control and water environment

926,sea cage fish farms cause wild fish to aggregate nearby nevertheless it is still not clear to what extent the attraction effect around sea cage fish farms varies according to the type and size of the reared species we examined this attraction effect in six sea cage fish farms across the aegean sea using an integrated approach combining these variables with seasonal and spatial factors six 5 minute rapid visual counts were conducted on each farm complex for comparing the wild fish aggregations around the sea cages concerning both cultivated species seabass and seabream and their sizes adult and juvenile we counted a total of 509 061 fishes representing 36 species and 18 families while 292 377 fish belonging to 34 species were counted in seabass cages 216 684 fish belonging to 27 species were counted at seabream cages in addition 160 192 fish belonging to 28 species were counted around the juvenile cages while 348 869 fish belonging to 34 species were counted at adult fish cages the study shows that wild fish communities are formed around the sea cages where seabass and seabream are reared in both adult and juvenile sizes in the aegean sea according to our results the fish species reared in the cages do not have a statistically significant effect on the wild fish community structure around the cages whereas fish size which was correlated with cage biomass and a

fish show different foraging behaviors sparus aurata usually chews food items before swallowing and under rearing conditions this feeding behavior generates significant feed waste that may be accessed by farm associated wild fish andrew et al 2003 2004 by contrast dicentrarchus labrax is an aggressive predator that exhibits competitive feeding behavior in the presence of pellet feeds conides et al 2016 as a result d labrax cages may export less waste feed than s aurata cages and be less attractive to wild fish that aggregate at fish farms to take advantage of waste feeding opportunities however waste feed production and attractiveness to wild fish may also depend on the size or age of reared fish if cages holding larger fish have a higher biomass density if larger body size or larger pellets cause fish to feed more wastefully or if cages holding larger fish have been active for a longer duration thereby accumulating more wild fish over time although there are many studies on the structure of wild fish communities around the sea cage fish farms no published study has compared wild fish aggregations according to the species being reared bacher et al 2012 examined the spatial and temporal extent of the attraction effect around the sparus aurata and thunnus thynnus farms in the nw mediterranean their study examined attraction using an integrated approach combining three factors spatial extent depth and season however for the first time the present study in which we also take seasonal and spatial variations into consideration aims to compare the effect of the type i e seabass and seabream and the size i e adult and juvenile fish of the reared species on the wild aggregations around sea cage fish farms in two different parts of the aegean sea 2 material and methods 2 1 ethical statement all observations were conducted in compliance with ege university animal experiments ethics committee secretariat animal welfare laws guidelines and policies as approved by protocol number 09 2015 and 25 02 2015 2 2 study area this study was carried out at six sea cage fish farms located in izmir i1 i2 and i3 and muğla m1 m2 and m3 provinces in the turkish aegean sea fig 1 all six fish farms cultivate both gilthead seabream sparus aurata and european seabass dicentrarchus labrax in the farms cultivated fishes are separated into the sea cages as adult and juvenile while the size of fish in the cages varies according to the farms in this study fish heavier than 250 g were assumed as an adult and those lighter than 50 g as juveniles the cages have consisted of 2 3 parallel sets and annual production ranges from 2000 to 3000 tons while the average biomass in the stations where the study was conducted was 172191 12421 kg in adult cages it was 3002 141 kg in juvenile cages juvenile fish are reared in cages for between 4 and 6 months while adult fish are reared in cages for approximately between 8 and 12 months high density polyethylene hdpe cages have been used in all of the sea cage fish farms specific details for each fish farm are given in table 1 2 3 rapid visual counts between july 2015 and july 2017 assemblages of wild fish around the sea cages were counted bimonthly via two day observation periods data were pooled according to the season in terms of seasons winter consists of january february and march spring covers april may and june summer covers july august and september autumn covers october november and december six 5 minute census counts rapid visual counts rvcs were conducted on each date corresponding with each farm complex while performing the rvcs divers recorded the reared species seabass seabream and their sizes juvenile adult in the sea cages as well every 5 minute visual count was carried out around the randomly selected sea cages and this was recorded by the divers each count was made between 10 00 and 14 00 and was performed by two divers the first diver concentrated on estimating the abundances of the dominant species present the second diver followed slightly behind the first and specifically looked for both highly mobile species and smaller less obvious fish that may have been missed by the first diver each count covered a volume of approximately 11 250 m3 15 m wide 15 m deep 50 m length and was conducted at depths of 5 18 m allowing for the water column from the surface to the bottom of the adjacent cage to be searched effectively özgül and angel 2013 fish were counted in abundance groups of 1 2 5 6 10 11 30 31 50 51 100 101 200 201 500 501 1000 and 1000 to minimize error based on the method of harmelin

seabream seabass size adult juvenile season and stations i1 i2 i3 m1 m2 m3 as a random factor to test for differences in total fish abundance the similarity matrix was computed using the euclidean distance on square root transformed data and post hoc pairwise comparisons were used to investigate significant results statistical significance was tested using 9999 permutations of residuals under a reduced model and type iii partial sums of squares significant terms were further examined by applying appropriate post hoc pairwise comparisons anderson et al 2008 all multivariate analyses were carried out using the primer 7 permanova statistical package data were square root transformed to weight the contributions of scarce species in the similarity coefficient similarity matrices were calculated using the bray curtis similarity coefficient we analyzed fish abundance data for each reared species and size using non metric multidimensional scaling nmds to assess the differences in community structure among fish farms locations within sampling times we applied the similarity percentage analysis simper routine to examine species contributions to within group similarity for the

results of simper analysis the difference between adult and juvenile cages is 72 this difference is mainly due to changes in the abundances of species such as b boops and a boyeri table 5 3 2 wild

significant differences between adult and juvenile fish in terms of season round in the seabream cages nmds ordination fig 7 according to the results of simper analysis the difference between adult

near both adult and juvenile seabass cages o melanura was also abundant near both adult cages s colias was observed at juvenile seabass cages a boyeri was especially determined around seabass cages fig 8 3 3 inter cage differences the mean abundances in both seabass and seabream cages were 1310 166 and 1069 159 respectively according to the results the type of fish grown in cages has no statistical effect on the wild fish community structure around the cages p 0 05 however reared fish species in i2 and m3 stations have a significant effect on the wild fish community table 6 the abundance in adult fish cages was 1516 1174 while in juvenile cages it was 819 139 it has to be noted that there was more fish density in adult fish cages p 0 05 table 6 according to the results of the permanova analysis an important factor affecting the fish community structure around the cages is the season wild fish abundance has the highest value with 1649 289 in the autumn while the lowest value with 1160 127 in the winter table 7 also there are statistical differences according to the stations p 0 05 the highest abundance of wild fish was in m3 with 3981 412 fish while the lowest was in i1 with 398 32 fish 4 discussion as found in our study the fish size in the cages has a major effect on the wild fish community structure around the cages while the fish species reared in the cages do not bear a statistically significant effect on it also more species and individuals were determined around adult cages furthermore the wild fish aggregations depend on whether cages holding larger fish have a higher biomass density it is obvious that the adult cages have been active for a long time thereby aggregating more wild fish over time there is a mean 57 fold difference in biomass between cages holding adult and juvenile fish where this study was conducted the other factors the season and the location of the sea cages appear to have an effect on the wild fish community structure around the cages the b boops is the main aggregated fish species around the sea cages in both regions following a boyeri s colias s aurita o melanura and b belone respectively akyol et al 2020a reported that approximately 80 5 of farm associated fish were b boops the species majorly belonged to the families sparidae carangidae and mugilidae they have been reported from sea cage fish farms near the southern coasts of spain as well dempster et al 2004 valle et al 2007 fernandez jover et al 2008 wild fish species richness near sea cages is affected variably by physio chemical factors region and seasons especially sst is one of the most important parameters for wild fish aggregations around sea cage fish farms in the aegean sea akyol et al 2020b the sst may affect the difference in wild fish aggregations between both regions in the study the mean sst was calculated as 19 6 3 6 c at the northern stations and 21 3 4 6 c at the southern stations and it was relatively close to each other t test p 0 05 the average value of sst in the southern part of the aegean sea was higher by at least 1 5 2 3 c than that recorded in the northern part of the aegean sea akyol et al 2020b however fish are poikilotherms and are sensitive to changes in the thermal conditions of their environment roubeix et al 2017 hence some lessepsian migrant fish and thermophilic fish such as pseudocaranx dentex were only observed around the sea cages in the southern aegean sea akyol et al 2020b the thermophilic fishes must have come because of the increasing temperatures in the area it is well known that fish abundance and diversity increase more towards the southern part of the aegean sea kocataş and bilecik 1992 even slight temperature differences between northern and southern latitudes might explain why more abundant wild fish can be found in southern aegean stations in addition temperature differences between two regions in the aegean sea also affect aquaculture activities in sea cage fish farms in the south aegean sea fish are given pellet feed for a longer period of time throughout the year than fish farms in the north aegean sea therefore the growth of fish in the cage is faster in the south the longer duration of this pellet based diet in the south may have also led to more wild fish at the stations in the south it is likely to more pellet feed residues around the seabream cages and they are expected to attract more wild fish however no statistically significant difference has been observed between the cages of seabass and seabream in this study whereas there is a statistically significant difference between adult and juvenile cages the difference is considered to be result of the dimensions and use time of the cages different stocking biomass and also the size and feeding density of pellets used for adult and juvenile fish akyol et al 2020a emphasized that b belone had the highest abundant fish around the juvenile cages connected with the using the micro pellets although the most important factor affecting the wild fish community around the cages is the biomass and size of reared fish the foraging behavior of reared fish might also be another important factor due to the amount of pellets scattered from the cages to the environment and the continuity ballester molto et al 2016 conides et al 2016 the use of pellets in different sizes and proportions in juvenile and adult cages is an important variable that affects the structure of the wild fish committee around the cage piedecausa et al 2010 aguida gimenez 2020 stated that the use of larger pellets causes more loss of feed near adult seabream cages both related to chewing behavior and feed intake as pellet size increases adults waste more feed since they have to subject the feed to a considerable oral manipulation to reduce its size before swallowing and consequently a significant amount of feed fragments escape from their mouth moreover it was determined that 39 1 of feed waste was from the sides of the cage nets balester molto et al 2017 the gathering of fish species such as bogue and grey mullets at or just below the water surface may be associated with this event bacher et al 2015 feeding metabolism in relation to water temperature increases as poikilothermic animals the fish metabolism slows down as water temperature decreases during the water temperature decreases less feed is given as the appetite of reared fish diminished mayer et al 2009 this can affect the presence and density of wild fish near marine cages in this study the lowest wild fish assemblages were determined in the winter as the feeding activity increases with the warming of the waters the amount of pellets scattered from the cages also increases and the wild fish assemblages reach the higher level fish are reared in juvenile cages for an average of 4 6 months while fish in adult cages are reared for an average of 8 12 months this situation can be interpreted as waste feed scattered from the cages staying in the environment for a longer time this may help explain why more wild fish are seen around adult cages in addition the fact that the nets in adult fish cages stay in water for a longer period of time than the ones in juvenile fish cages may also affect this result some organisms mussels algae etc that develop on the nets of adult fish cages can attract wild fish to this area these organisms in the nets are also an alternative food source for wild fish however these organisms can limitedly hold on to the fish cage nets as the net changes are more frequent in the juvenile fish cages in terms of all juvenile and adult fish cages the seabream adult fish cages had the highest abundance in total and b boops were the major fish in all cages as the second abundant fish a boyeri was counted especially in the juvenile cages though it was observed in all cages a boyeri is planktivorous golani et al 2006 and they might prefer to feed on micro pellets around the juvenile cages moreover a boyeri might be more in number in juvenile cages due to the less occurrence of larger fish which might prefer bigger pellets in addition the aggregations of them near the adult fish cages may be explained by the organic matter and zooplankton for feeding and its fad effect pelagic a boyeri the typical fad associated fish have smaller sizes than carangids and clupeids sea cages can act as conventional fads by attracting wild fish and fad associated fish are usually smaller 15 cm in the mediterranean dempster et al 2002 sanchez jerez et al 2011 as mentioned above that the farm aggregated wild fish consume large quantities of pellets lost from cages dempster et al 2002 fernandez jover et al 2008 due to the lost pellets wild fish feed on excess feed around fish farms along the coastal zone if this occurs the condition of wild fish can increase within a no take area leasehold area and their lipid profile can become modified izquierdo gomez et al 2015 for instance b boops with 402 mm in total length 986 g weight and o melanura with 357 mm tl that were caught from mariculture areas have been reported as maximal size akyol et al 2014 ceyhan et al 2018 besides local fishermen know the highly conditioned and fat fish around the fish farms and they can target them once they leave the farms arechavala lopez et al 2011 a recent stomach content study indicated that pellet food was the most consumed food across all seasons 333 by whiting merlangius merlangus around sea cage fish farms in the black sea şensurat genç et al 2019 in fact intensive cage aquaculture generates considerable quantities of waste including particulate uneaten feed fish feces and soluble excretory products settled uneaten feed pellets are assumed to be the primary cause of ecological impact on the benthos community beneath the cages vezzulli et al 2003 while the 34 fish and one sea turtle were observed at the seabass cages there were 26 fish and one dolphin at the seabream cages b boops were the most dominant species around both cultivated species cages as is known one of the most abundant wild fish around sea cage farms in the mediterranean sea the bogue boops boops sparidae is a major part of the fish assemblages all over the mediterranean sea dempster et al 2002 valle et al 2007 fernandez jover et al 2008 akyol and ertosluk 2010 this intense aggregation can be explained by its variable feeding habits that an omnivore fish has and its ability to live on a variety of sea bottoms sand mud rock seaweeds and seagrass beds at a depth range of 0 350 m arechavala lopez et al 2011 froese and pauly 2020 it was determined that b boops constitute a dense aggregation around the sea cages regardless of the species and size that are grown in the cage however the highest density was recorded around the adult seabream cages table 4 during the observations the most abundant wild fishes were observed near the m3 station and 92 5 of wild fishes were b boops in this station was used the protection net against predators such as monk seals tunas bluefish and dolphins the space between both nets may have been used as a shelter by some wild fishes b boops generally prefers cold water periods and are the dominant species during the winter around the sea cages in the mediterranean at the same time b boops are a significant component of wild fish assemblages around sea cages especially during winter months valle et al 2007 fernandez jover et al 2008 however it was determined that b boops formed larger aggregations in the summer autumn season in this study this may be related to the increase of feeding activity in cages during the months when the water temperature is higher similarly b boops are observed year round at the t thynnus farms though the abundance is higher during the warmer part of the year segvic bubic et al 2011 riera et al 2014 also reported that b boops dominated throughout the year being slightly more abundant in the spring and summer months it is obvious that b boops is an inhabitant of the sea cage farms in the whole year however its abundance increases in warmer seasons in the central and eastern mediterranean being attracted to food pellets consumers such as b boops s colias in the sea cages attract large numbers of predatory species such as coryphaena hippurus seriola dumerili pomatomus saltatrix thunnus thynnus and other pelagic species dempster et al 2002 2005 2010 valle et al 2007 the benthic fish species abundance generally decreased when the sea cages moved to deeper zones whereas semi pelagic and pelagic fish species abundances increased accordingly since then the apex predators such as tunas and dolphins have been observed more often around off shore sea cages pers obs this change is believed to have led to a decrease in the number of other predators such as coryphaena hippurus seriola dumerili pomatomus saltatrix arechavala lopez et al 2015 as a result b boops s colias and s aurita have reached a greater abundance these species having the potential of hosting parasites may make the fish in the cages more vulnerable to great risks arechavala lopez et al 2013 artificial reefs and fish attraction devices fads have traditionally been used to enhance populations of target species by favoring both spawners and recruits tupper and boutilier 1997 it has been suggested that fish farms should be managed similarly to fads dempster et al 2002 fish cages affect the presence abundance diet and residence times of wild fish assemblages attracting a huge variety of species by providing food and refuge from predators boyra et al 2004 tuya et al 2006 valle et al 2007 large quantities of lost food pellets and feces from cages are available to farm aggregated wild fish fernandez jover et al 2008 actually altering biological conditions because of the high food availability skog et al 2003 fernandez jover et al 2007 however this study has shown that the fish species reared in cages do not contribute to this attractiveness in conclusion the results of this study indicate that the diversity of wild fish communities is relatively high although there are differences between the studied regions sparids carangids mugilids scombrids clupeids and pomatomids are predominant families throughout the aegean sea moreover when the sea cages are separately classified as reared fish species i e seabass and seabream and size i e adult and juvenile fish some differences have shown up in terms of wild fish species richness both seasonal and regional abundance the interactions between fish farms and the ecosystem are multi dimensional herein we considered only a small fraction of this issue via this study therefore the study indicates that there is no significant difference between reared species but the size of the fish reared season and location do influence wild fish aggregations around the sea cages the size effect probably reflects a large increase in cage biomass as reared fish increase in size which will necessitate higher feed inputs by farmers cages with large fish have also in general been continuously active for longer likely accumulating wild fish over that time while the larger pellets fed to larger fish may increase the production of waste fragments a fish farm area can be considered as a marine protected area for wild fish populations therefore sea cages should be taken into account as a crucial element in fisheries management since they may bear a significant influence on fish populations and may have an indirect effect on fish assemblages and the entire coastal ecosystem for sustainability of the wild fishes around the sea cage fish farms it can be suggested to use an additional protection net against the predators additionally the ban on fishing in the 200 meter area around the sea cages should be increased in terms of fishery management thus the maintenance of the bio filter function of wild fishes for getting minimization of the sedimentation in benthic environments can be guaranteed it is obvious that the sea cage fish farms have a strong potential for wild fish aggregation the species and population of which are difficult to predict therefore this unpredictable stock should be taken into account for management plans by

926,sea cage fish farms cause wild fish to aggregate nearby nevertheless it is still not clear to what extent the attraction effect around sea cage fish farms varies according to the type and size of the reared species we examined this attraction effect in six sea cage fish farms across the aegean sea using an integrated approach combining these variables with seasonal and spatial factors six 5 minute rapid visual counts were conducted on each farm complex for comparing the wild fish aggregations around the sea cages concerning both cultivated species seabass and seabream and their sizes adult and juvenile we counted a total of 509 061 fishes representing 36 species and 18 families while 292 377 fish belonging to 34 species were counted in seabass cages 216 684 fish belonging to 27 species were counted at seabream cages in addition 160 192 fish belonging to 28 species were counted around the juvenile cages while 348 869 fish belonging to 34 species were counted at adult fish cages the study shows that wild fish communities are formed around the sea cages where seabass and seabream are reared in both adult and juvenile sizes in the aegean sea according to our results the fish species reared in the cages do not have a statistically significant effect on the wild fish community structure around the cages whereas fish size which was correlated with cage biomass and a longer history of feeding had a strong effect other factors affecting the wild fish community structure around the cages are the season and the location of the cages keywords aquaculture species size variability seabass seabream visual census 1 introduction mollusk and fish mariculture produce 1 6 million tons in about 13 17 000 farms in the mediterranean area and hatcheries of dicentrarchus

turkish aegean sea akyol et al 2019 natural and artificial fish aggregating devices i e fads in open water are widely recognized for their capacity to attract pelagic fishes hunter and mitchell 1967 deudero 2001 sea cages fish farms may be analogous to large fads and the floating cages provide structure in the pelagic environment although the unused portion of feed that falls through the cages probably enhances the attraction effect bjordal and skar 1992 dempster et al 2002 sanchez jerez et al 2011 the phenomenon is widespread and the large aggregations of wild fish have been well known around the sea cage fish farms throughout the mediterranean including spain dempster et al 2002 2004 2005 valle et al 2007 fernandez jover et al 2008 arechavala lopez et al 2011 bacher et al 2012

fish show different foraging behaviors sparus aurata usually chews food items before swallowing and under rearing conditions this feeding behavior generates significant feed waste that may be accessed by farm associated wild fish andrew et al 2003 2004 by contrast dicentrarchus labrax is an aggressive predator that exhibits competitive feeding behavior in the presence of pellet feeds conides et al 2016 as a result d labrax cages may export less waste feed than s aurata cages and be less attractive to wild fish that aggregate at fish farms to take advantage of waste feeding opportunities however waste feed production and attractiveness to wild fish may also depend on the size or age of reared fish if cages holding larger fish have a higher biomass density if larger body size or larger pellets cause fish to feed more wastefully or if cages holding larger fish have been active for a longer duration thereby accumulating more wild fish over time although there are many studies on the structure of wild fish communities around the sea cage fish farms no published study has compared wild fish aggregations according to the species being reared bacher et al 2012 examined the spatial and temporal extent of the attraction effect around the sparus aurata and thunnus thynnus farms in the nw mediterranean their study examined attraction using an integrated approach combining three factors spatial extent depth and season however for the first time the present study in which we also take seasonal and spatial variations into consideration aims to compare the effect of the type i e seabass and seabream and the size i e adult and juvenile fish of the reared species on the wild aggregations around sea cage fish farms in two different parts of the aegean sea 2 material and methods 2 1 ethical

09 2015 and 25 02 2015 2 2 study area this study was carried out at six sea cage fish farms located in izmir i1 i2 and i3 and muğla m1 m2 and m3 provinces in the turkish aegean sea fig 1 all six fish farms cultivate both gilthead seabream sparus aurata and european seabass dicentrarchus labrax in the farms cultivated fishes are separated into the sea cages as adult and juvenile while the size of fish in the cages varies according to the farms in this study fish heavier than 250 g were assumed as an adult and those lighter than 50 g as juveniles the cages have consisted of 2 3 parallel sets and annual production ranges from 2000 to 3000 tons while the average biomass in the stations where the study was conducted was 172191 12421 kg in adult cages it was 3002 141 kg in juvenile cages juvenile fish are reared in cages for between 4 and 6 months while adult fish are reared in cages for approximately between 8 and 12 months high density polyethylene hdpe cages have been used in all of the sea cage fish farms specific details for each fish farm are given in table 1 2 3 rapid visual counts between july 2015 and july 2017 assemblages of wild fish around the sea cages were counted bimonthly via two day observation periods data were pooled according to the season in terms of seasons winter consists of january february and march spring covers april may and june summer covers july august and september autumn covers october november and december six 5 minute census counts rapid visual counts rvcs were conducted on each date corresponding with each farm complex while performing the rvcs divers recorded the reared species seabass seabream and their sizes juvenile adult in the sea cages as well every 5 minute visual count was carried out around the randomly selected sea cages and this was recorded by the divers each count was made between 10 00 and 14 00 and was performed by two divers the first diver concentrated on estimating the abundances of the dominant species present the second diver followed slightly behind the first and specifically looked for both highly mobile species and smaller less obvious fish that may have been missed by the first diver each count covered a volume of approximately 11 250 m3 15 m wide 15 m deep 50 m length and was conducted at depths of 5 18 m allowing for the water column from the surface to the bottom of the adjacent cage to be searched effectively özgül and angel 2013 fish were counted in abundance groups of 1 2 5 6 10 11 30 31 50 51 100 101 200 201 500 501 1000 and 1000 to minimize error based on the method of harmelin vivien et al 1985 and the average total length tl of each species was noted gopro hero4 black action camera was also used in all observations to check fish identifications sea surface temperature sst measured using a dive computer suunto d9 were recorded on days when census counts were conducted 2 4 statistical analysis a univariate permanova considered 3 fixed factors and 1 random factor species seabream seabass size adult juvenile season and stations i1 i2 i3 m1 m2 m3 as a random factor to test for differences in total fish abundance the similarity matrix was computed using the euclidean distance on square root transformed data and post hoc pairwise comparisons were used to investigate significant results statistical significance was tested using 9999 permutations of residuals under a reduced model and type iii partial sums of squares significant terms were further examined by applying appropriate post hoc pairwise comparisons anderson et al 2008 all multivariate analyses were carried out using the primer 7 permanova statistical package data were square root transformed to weight the contributions of scarce species in the similarity coefficient similarity matrices were calculated using the bray curtis similarity coefficient we analyzed fish abundance data for each reared species and size using non metric multidimensional scaling nmds to assess the differences in community structure among fish farms locations within sampling times we applied the similarity percentage analysis simper routine to examine species contributions to within group similarity for the most important factor of species and size clarke and warwick 1994 3 results we counted a total of 509 061 fishes representing 36 species and 18 families at our selected six sea cage fish farms

results of simper analysis the difference between adult and juvenile cages is 72 this difference is mainly due to changes in the abundances of species such as b boops and a boyeri table 5 3 2 wild

significant differences between adult and juvenile fish in terms of season round in the seabream cages nmds ordination fig 7 according to the results of simper analysis the difference between adult

near both adult and juvenile seabass cages o melanura was also abundant near both adult cages s colias was observed at juvenile seabass cages a boyeri was especially determined around seabass cages fig 8 3 3 inter cage differences the mean abundances in both seabass and seabream cages were 1310 166 and 1069 159 respectively according to the results the type of fish grown in cages has no statistical effect on the wild fish community structure around the cages p 0 05 however reared fish species in i2 and m3 stations have a significant effect on the wild fish community table 6 the abundance in adult fish cages was 1516 1174 while in juvenile cages it was 819 139 it has to be noted that there was more fish density in adult fish cages p 0 05 table 6 according to the results of the permanova analysis an important factor affecting the fish community structure around the cages is the season wild fish abundance has the highest value with 1649 289 in the autumn while the lowest value with 1160 127 in the winter table 7 also there are statistical differences according to the stations p 0 05 the highest abundance of wild fish was in m3 with 3981 412 fish while the lowest was in i1 with 398 32 fish 4 discussion as found in our study the fish size in the cages has a major effect on the wild fish community structure around the cages while the fish species reared in the cages do not bear a statistically significant effect on it also more species and individuals were determined around adult cages furthermore the wild fish aggregations depend on whether cages holding larger fish have a higher biomass density it is obvious that the adult cages have been active for a long time thereby aggregating more wild fish over time there is a mean 57 fold difference in biomass between cages holding adult and juvenile fish where this study was conducted the other factors the season and the location of the sea cages appear to have an effect on the wild fish community structure around the cages the b boops is the main aggregated fish species around the sea cages in both regions following a boyeri s colias s aurita o melanura and b belone respectively akyol et al 2020a reported that approximately 80 5 of farm associated fish were b boops the species majorly belonged to the families sparidae carangidae and mugilidae they have been reported from sea cage fish farms near the southern coasts of spain as well dempster et al 2004 valle et al 2007 fernandez jover et al 2008 wild fish species richness near sea cages is affected variably by physio chemical factors region and seasons especially sst is one of the most important parameters for wild fish aggregations around sea cage fish farms in the aegean sea akyol et al 2020b the sst may affect the difference in wild fish aggregations between both regions in the study the mean sst was calculated as 19 6 3 6 c at the northern stations and 21 3 4 6 c at the southern stations and it was relatively close to each other t test p 0 05 the average value of sst in the southern part of the aegean sea was higher by at least 1 5 2 3 c than that recorded in the northern part of the aegean sea akyol et al 2020b however fish are poikilotherms and are sensitive to changes in the thermal conditions of their environment roubeix et al 2017 hence some lessepsian migrant fish and thermophilic fish such as pseudocaranx dentex were only observed around the sea cages in the southern aegean sea akyol et al 2020b the thermophilic fishes must have come because of the increasing temperatures in the area it is well known that fish abundance and diversity increase more towards the southern part of the aegean sea kocataş and bilecik 1992 even slight temperature differences between northern and southern latitudes might explain why more abundant wild fish can be found in southern aegean stations in addition temperature differences between two regions in the aegean sea also affect aquaculture activities in sea cage fish farms in the south aegean sea fish are given pellet feed for a longer period of time throughout the year than fish farms in the north aegean sea therefore the growth of fish in the cage is faster in the south the longer duration of this pellet based diet in the south may have also led to more wild fish at the stations in the south it is likely to more pellet feed residues around the seabream cages and they are expected to attract more wild fish however no statistically significant difference has been observed between the cages of seabass and seabream in this study whereas there is a statistically significant difference between adult and juvenile cages the difference is considered to be result of the dimensions and use time of the cages different stocking biomass and also the size and feeding density of pellets used for adult and juvenile fish akyol et al 2020a emphasized that b belone had the highest abundant fish around the juvenile cages connected with the using the micro pellets although the most important factor affecting the wild fish community around the cages is the biomass and size of reared fish the foraging behavior of reared fish might also be another important factor due to the amount of pellets scattered from the cages to the environment and the continuity ballester molto et al 2016 conides et al 2016 the use of pellets in different sizes and proportions in juvenile and adult cages is an important variable that affects the structure of the wild fish committee around the cage piedecausa et al 2010 aguida gimenez 2020 stated that the use of larger pellets causes more loss of feed near adult seabream cages both related to chewing behavior and feed intake as pellet size increases adults waste more feed since they have to subject the feed to a considerable oral manipulation to reduce its size before swallowing and consequently a significant amount of feed fragments escape from their mouth moreover it was determined that 39 1 of feed waste was from the sides of the cage nets balester molto et al 2017 the gathering of fish species such as bogue and grey mullets at or just below the water surface may be associated with this event bacher et al 2015 feeding metabolism in relation to water temperature increases as poikilothermic animals the fish metabolism slows down as water temperature decreases during the water temperature decreases less feed is given as the appetite of reared fish diminished mayer et al 2009 this can affect the presence and density of wild fish near marine cages in this study the lowest wild fish assemblages were determined in the winter as the feeding activity increases with the warming of the waters the amount of pellets scattered from the cages also increases and the wild fish assemblages reach the higher level fish are reared in juvenile cages for an average of 4 6 months while fish in adult cages are reared for an average of 8 12 months this situation can be interpreted as waste feed scattered from the cages staying in the environment for a longer time this may help explain why more wild fish are seen around adult cages in addition the fact that the nets in adult fish cages stay in water for a longer period of time than the ones in juvenile fish cages may also affect this result some organisms mussels algae etc that develop on the nets of adult fish cages can attract wild fish to this area these organisms in the nets are also an alternative food source for wild fish however these organisms can limitedly hold on to the fish cage nets as the net changes are more frequent in the juvenile fish cages in terms of all juvenile and adult fish cages the seabream adult fish cages had the highest abundance in total and b boops were the major fish in all cages as the second abundant fish a boyeri was counted especially in the juvenile cages though it was observed in all cages a boyeri is planktivorous golani et al 2006 and they might prefer to feed on micro pellets around the juvenile cages moreover a boyeri might be more in number in juvenile cages due to the less occurrence of larger fish which might prefer bigger pellets in addition the aggregations of them near the adult fish cages may be explained by the organic matter and zooplankton for feeding and its fad effect pelagic a boyeri the typical fad associated fish have smaller sizes than carangids and clupeids sea cages can act as conventional fads by attracting wild fish and fad associated fish are usually smaller 15 cm in the mediterranean dempster et al 2002 sanchez jerez et al 2011 as mentioned above that the farm aggregated wild fish consume large quantities of pellets lost from cages dempster et al 2002 fernandez jover et al 2008 due to the lost pellets wild fish feed on excess feed around fish farms along the coastal zone if this occurs the condition of wild fish can increase within a no take area leasehold area and their lipid profile can become modified izquierdo gomez et al 2015 for instance b boops with 402 mm in total length 986 g weight and o melanura with 357 mm tl that were caught from mariculture areas have been reported as maximal size akyol et al 2014 ceyhan et al 2018 besides local fishermen know the highly conditioned and fat fish around the fish farms and they can target them once they leave the farms arechavala lopez et al 2011 a recent stomach content study indicated that pellet food was the most consumed food across all seasons 333 by whiting merlangius merlangus around sea cage fish farms in the black sea şensurat genç et al 2019 in fact intensive cage aquaculture generates considerable quantities of waste including particulate uneaten feed fish feces and soluble excretory products settled uneaten feed pellets are assumed to be the primary cause of ecological impact on the benthos community beneath the cages vezzulli et al 2003 while the 34 fish and one sea turtle were observed at the seabass cages there were 26 fish and one dolphin at the seabream cages b boops were the most dominant species around both cultivated species cages as is known one of the most abundant wild fish around sea cage farms in the mediterranean sea the bogue boops boops sparidae is a major part of the fish assemblages all over the mediterranean sea dempster et al 2002 valle et al 2007 fernandez jover et al 2008 akyol and ertosluk 2010 this intense aggregation can be explained by its variable feeding habits that an omnivore fish has and its ability to live on a variety of sea bottoms sand mud rock seaweeds and seagrass beds at a depth range of 0 350 m arechavala lopez et al 2011 froese and pauly 2020 it was determined that b boops constitute a dense aggregation around the sea cages regardless of the species and size that are grown in the cage however the highest density was recorded around the adult seabream cages table 4 during the observations the most abundant wild fishes were observed near the m3 station and 92 5 of wild fishes were b boops in this station was used the protection net against predators such as monk seals tunas bluefish and dolphins the space between both nets may have been used as a shelter by some wild fishes b boops generally prefers cold water periods and are the dominant species during the winter around the sea cages in the mediterranean at the same time b boops are a significant component of wild fish assemblages around sea cages especially during winter months valle et al 2007 fernandez jover et al 2008 however it was determined that b boops formed larger aggregations in the summer autumn season in this study this may be related to the increase of feeding activity in cages during the months when the water temperature is higher similarly b boops are observed year round at the t thynnus farms though the abundance is higher during the warmer part of the year segvic bubic et al 2011 riera et al 2014 also reported that b boops dominated throughout the year being slightly more abundant in the spring and summer months it is obvious that b boops is an inhabitant of the sea cage farms in the whole year however its abundance increases in warmer seasons in the central and eastern mediterranean being attracted to food pellets consumers such as b boops s colias in the sea cages attract large numbers of predatory species such as coryphaena hippurus seriola dumerili pomatomus saltatrix thunnus thynnus and other pelagic species dempster et al 2002 2005 2010 valle et al 2007 the benthic fish species abundance generally decreased when the sea cages moved to deeper zones whereas semi pelagic and pelagic fish species abundances increased accordingly since then the apex predators such as tunas and dolphins have been observed more often around off shore sea cages pers obs this change is believed to have led to a decrease in the number of other predators such as coryphaena hippurus seriola dumerili pomatomus saltatrix arechavala lopez et al 2015 as a result b boops s colias and s aurita have reached a greater abundance these species having the potential of hosting parasites may make the fish in the cages more vulnerable to great risks arechavala lopez et al 2013 artificial reefs and fish attraction devices fads have traditionally been used to enhance populations of target species by favoring both spawners and recruits tupper and boutilier 1997 it has been suggested that fish farms should be managed similarly to fads dempster et al 2002 fish cages affect the presence abundance diet and residence times of wild fish assemblages attracting a huge variety of species by providing food and refuge from predators boyra et al 2004 tuya et al 2006 valle et al 2007 large quantities of lost food pellets and feces from cages are available to farm aggregated wild fish fernandez jover et al 2008 actually altering biological conditions because of the high food availability skog et al 2003 fernandez jover et al 2007 however this study has shown that the fish species reared in cages do not contribute to this attractiveness in conclusion the results of this study indicate that the diversity of wild fish communities is relatively high although there are differences between the studied regions sparids carangids mugilids scombrids clupeids and pomatomids are predominant families throughout the aegean sea moreover when the sea cages are separately classified as reared fish species i e seabass and seabream and size i e adult and juvenile fish some differences have shown up in terms of wild fish species richness both seasonal and regional abundance the interactions between fish farms and the ecosystem are multi dimensional herein we considered only a small fraction of this issue via this study therefore the study indicates that there is no significant difference between reared species but the size of the fish reared season and location do influence wild fish aggregations around the sea cages the size effect probably reflects a large increase in cage biomass as reared fish increase in size which will necessitate higher feed inputs by farmers cages with large fish have also in general been continuously active for longer likely accumulating wild fish over that time while the larger pellets fed to larger fish may increase the production of waste fragments a fish farm area can be considered as a marine protected area for wild fish populations therefore sea cages should be taken into account as a crucial element in fisheries management since they may bear a significant influence on fish populations and may have an indirect effect on fish assemblages and the entire coastal ecosystem for sustainability of the wild fishes around the sea cage fish farms it can be suggested to use an additional protection net against the predators additionally the ban on fishing in the 200 meter area around the sea cages should be increased in terms of fishery management thus the maintenance of the bio filter function of wild fishes for getting minimization of the sedimentation in benthic environments can be guaranteed it is obvious that the sea cage fish farms have a strong potential for wild fish aggregation the species and population of which are difficult to predict therefore this unpredictable stock should be taken into account for management plans by

927,large boreal rivers in sweden are generally impounded by hydropower dams and a large proportion of main stem shallow flowing habitats have been lost tributaries often contain the last undisturbed habitats and could be important for the conservation of species diversity in particular tributary mouth areas could be biodiversity hot spots due to their vicinity to the main stem and favorable environmental conditions in this study we investigate whether tributary mouth areas in two impounded boreal rivers ume river and lule river could be regarded as biodiversity hot spots for fish based on standardized electrofishing in 20 tributary mouths we find that overall fish diversity is generally low the highest species richness and diversity was found in mouth areas dominated by intermediate substrate sizes gravel cobble few if any species were found in areas where fine sediments smaller than sand dominated the tributary mouth areas had similar species richness and diversity as areas in the tributaries located 1 km upstream of the mouth but the fish community composition often differed between these two types of sites management action favoring fish diversity in the tributary mouth areas could include protection or rehabilitation of areas dominated by medium sized substrate and reduction of erosion and transport of fine sediments in the tributaries overall we find no support for tributary mouths being hot spots for fish biodiversity and while some patterns in diversity gives hints on suitable management action it is important to further understand impacts in tributaries and their mouths and the temporal dynamics of the fish community keywords aggradation boreal rivers fish biodiversity river morphology river sediment size tributary confluence 1 introduction large rivers are important ecosystems for aquatic biodiversity typically housing a higher fish biodiversity than smaller rivers with some species being adapted specifically for habitats characteristic of these larger systems jackson et al 2001 oberdorff et al 2011 miranda et al 2019 the biodiversity of many of these large ecosystems has been negatively impacted during the last century as they have been heavily exploited for many purposes including energy production grill et al 2019 while damming of main stem rivers can secure large amounts of affordable energy for society rex et al 2014 schäfer 2021 damming also disrupts longitudinal connectivity and alters hydrological hydrogeomorphological and thermal conditions baxter 1977 ligon et al 1995 vörösmarty et al 2010 anderson et al 2015 the result is spatially and seasonally homogenized slow flowing river sections between dams with severely disrupted connection among them which reduces their overall biodiversity poff et al 2007 malm renöfält et

heavily modified rivers rehabilitation measures and mitigation of continued biodiversity loss are still required to secure a good ecological potential ec 2000 2020 gos 2020 such management action however requires much information about the current ecological state of different areas in relation to their hydro and geomorphology so that restoration and rehabilitiation measures can be optimally directed to those with the strongest positive effects on biodiversity e g borg et al 2007 jansson et al 2007 renschler et al 2007 widén et al 2016 tributaries to large impounded rivers often have a lower degree of habitat alteration and more natural sediment transport flow dynamics and temperature regimes as compared to the main stem given that they themselves are not impounded rice et al 2008 ziv et al 2012 pracheil et al 2013 marques et al 2018 vasconcelos et al 2021 protection of unaltered tributaries and restoration of ecologically degraded tributaries could thereby retain or improve

pracheil et al 2013 dunn paukert 2021 where network dispersal extensive upstream dispersal in tributaries is more likely than in small tributaries grenoulliet et al 2004 nevertheless similar effects

sections upstream from the mouth often have lower species richness than the main stem czeglédi et al 2016 miranda et al 2019 but can nevertheless be important for biodiversity in the river network for instance tributaries can be highly heterogeneous in terms of flow and environmental features offering a variety of habitats jackson et al 2001 wohl 2017 they also offer refuge from extreme temperature and flow events in the main stem contain spawning grounds or juvenile habitat and create migration corridors between the main stem and upstream lakes and smaller streams jackson et al 2001 fausch et al 2002 meyer et al 2007 rice et al 2008 wohl 2017 management action to improve habitats in the main stems of these rivers are often costly and incongruous with hydropower production at least with high production but measures in their tributaries may be more feasible from a socio economic perspective hence tributaries and the tributary mouth areas in particular are possibly key target areas for restoration and rehabilitation activities the aim of this study was to provide baseline information about fish biodiversity in tributary mouths in two heavily impounded boreal rivers in northern sweden ume and lule river both of which are classified as strongly affected by fragmentation dynesius nilsson 1994 we investigate the effects of some key environmental characteristics hydrogeomorphology and bottom substrate of tributary mouth areas on the fish fauna composition more specifically we aimed to 1 assess the number of species and diversity of fish in tributary mouth areas to collect initial data on whether these areas could be viewed as fish biodiversity hot spots i e in relation to the known species in the main stem 2 investigate which tributary mouth habitats

guilds to habitat characteristics in tributary mouth areas 4 compare diversity in tributary mouth areas with sites located further upstream in the tributaries ca 1 km upstream of the confluence 2 materials and methods 2 1 survey areas the surveyed tributaries belong to two large swedish boreal rivers ume river and lule river fig 1 located in the svecofennian orogen province of the baltic shield both rivers transverse the country in a northwest southeast direction starting in the alpine region near norway and draining into the baltic sea bothnian sea and gulf of bothnia respectively the rivers are of similar size table 1 have similar hydro climatic variation within their catchments smhi 2022 and have multiple hydropower impoundments along a large portion of each river fig 1 in the downstream parts of both rivers power production follows a run of the river scheme with the flow being regulated by storage reservoirs in the upper parts of the catchments the tributaries included in this study were limited to the region between the first hydroelectric dam from the sea and the highest coastal line after the weichselian glaciation so as to be able to work with comparable fish communities in this geographical area the river margins of both rivers are dominated by erosion sensitive materials sandy substrates in the more upstream sections with an increased occurrence and dominance of silt and flood sediments as the rivers flow further downstream sgi 2022 much of the surrounding land consists of moraine glacial river sediments and peat sgu 2022 tributaries in ume river were distributed over a main stem distance of 84 km most downstream tributary located 30 km from the sea and tributaries in lule river were distributed over a main stem distance of 104 km most downstream tributary located 50 km from the sea fig 1 2 2 site selection tributaries entering ume and lule rivers have mouth areas that can be broadly classified as either aggrading or non aggrading based on the presence or absence of sediment plumes at the confluence using digital aerial map surveys from public web services https maps google se https eniro se we identified candidate tributary mouths based on the aerial photographs extracted information on mean discharge mq for each candidate from the s hype model of national hydrological statistics bergstrand et al 2014 and thereafter selected a set of tributaries along a wide range of mq for both confluence types impoundments with only one type of tributary aggrading non aggrading were excluded and tributaries assessed as too deep for wading or culverted or dammed directly at the mouth were not considered from the candidate set we selected tributaries so that each confluence type was represented by equal numbers of streams 5 of each type in each of the two rivers covering similar ranges of mq assessment of tributary mouth type was also made in the field see 2 5 environmental survey methodology and final designation was based on the combined information the selected tributaries were located in two impoundments in ume river and three impoundments in lule river table 2 2 3 fish communities fish communities in the two river systems are similar table 3 the main differences are the absence of alpine bullhead cottus poecilopus in ume river records and the absence of river lamprey lampetra fluviatilis in lule river records gbif 2020 river lamprey however does not occur upstream of the first dam in ume river anadromous salmonids atlantic salmon salmo salar and brown trout s trutta can use a fishway to pass the same dam reaching the most downstream surveyed impoundment of ume river but are either not expected in the survey area s salar which mainly migrates up the large tributary vindel river or have local non migratory populations s trutta making species presence effectively equivalent in both rivers arctic charr salvelinus alpinus mainly occurs in the alpine region of the catchments and populations in the lower parts are likely stocked into lakes and hence not expected in the river tributaries two non native salmonid species are present in the area rainbow trout oncorhynchus mykiss and brook charr salvelinus fontinalis the former does not reproduce and stems from unintentional escape events from aquaculture net pens the latter was intentionally introduced during the 19 20th centuries and established in some tributaries with respect to historical electrofishing data lule river is less surveyed than ume river table 1 sers 2020 however the sources of presence absence data for the catchments include more than electrofishing surveys lundberg 1899 ekman 1922 widén et al 2016 gbif 2020 and the species list is in accordance with recent national distribution maps kullander et al 2012 for each species we collected additional information about tolerance red list status classification of the extinction risk of a given species within a specified geographic area and habitat

electrofishing surveys were conducted once at each site in autumn august september by professional electrofishing consultants equipment straight dc bank side aggregates lug ab l 1000 luleå 700 800 v 0 3 0 4 a following swedish standard practices the so called three pass protocol bergquist et al 2014 in each tributary one site at the tributary mouth i e near the confluence with the main stem and one site located 1 km upstream of the mouth were electrofished fished areas ranged between 55 and 760 m2 depending on the size of the tributary smaller areas in smaller tributaries and vice versa see fig s3 and environmental characteristics limiting electrofishing at sites with deep sections the survey was limited to the wadable section along one of the banks in line with swedish standard methodology one upstream site remained unfished as it was too deep for wading when visited for each electrofishing pass at a given site all fish caught were counted identified to species and measured for length and mass 2 5 environmental survey methodology coordinated with the electrofishing survey a standardized environmental survey was conducted at each site following the swedish electrofishing protocol bergquist et al 2014 within this protocol the dominant sediment types in the top layer of the bottom substrate are classified by ocular inspection atcross channel transects which are located every 10 meters along the survey site from the overall survey site data the three most dominant sediment classes are summarized into an ordinal scale relating to overall coverage d1 d3 with associated classification of areal coverage see figure text to fig 2 which provides a coarse but generally accurate picture of the general sediment dynamics fine scale sediment cover data is however not available in addition a more detailed investigation of the tributary mouths was made in association to a parallel study on vascular plants in and around the same tributaries r jansson b malm renöfält in prep based on field observations each mouth area was classified as 1 aggrading or non aggrading 2 sheltered or non sheltered 3 situated in an embayment or not 4 having boulders protruding above the

linear mixed models lmm generalized linear models glm and generalized linear mixed models glmm for statistical models with more than a single factor table 4 the initial global models specified below were reduced based on the relative akaike information criterion modified for small sample size aicc of all subordinate models including the global model and the intercept only model using the mumin r package bartoń 2020 to avoid uninfluential factors and thereby increase the residual degrees of freedom to reduce the risk of excluding influential factors the most complex model within two aicc units from the most parsimonious model was used for interpretation when models were run as poisson regressions i e for count data overdispersion was tested using a one sided dharma nonparametric dispersion test hartig 2021 if significant overdispersion was indicated glms were re constructed as quasi poisson regressions ver hoef boveng 2007 and glmms were fitted with an additional observation level

processing and visualization were done within the tidyverse suite for r wickham et al 2019 2 7 2 dimension reduction of habitat variables in tributary mouths to characterize and summarize habitat features in the tributary mouths we conducted a non metric multidimensional scaling nmds analysis using the vegan r package oksanen et al 2019 habitat variables included i ordinal ranks of nine different sediment classes ii aggradation status aggrading non aggrading iii presence absence of protruding boulders iv presence absence of shallow areas v binary classification of embayment vi binary classification of whether or not the mouth was sheltered vii ordinal rank of water turbidity and viii ordinal rank of flow velocity see fig 2 for a key to the variables we extracted two dimensions k 2 based on bray curtis dissimilarity results were centred and half scaled variation was maximized in the first dimension by principal component rotation stress value was derived based on the type i approach weak ties 2 7 3 nuisance factors for species abundance initially we ran a suite of simple one factor poisson glms to investigate factors suspected based on previous studies to generally influence species abundance in the catches at the 0k and 1k sites to make informed decisions on whether or not to include any of the factors in the construction of models specified below factors

in number of species and diversity shannon h between aggrading and non aggrading tributary mouth areas were tested using poisson glmm glm and lmm lm respectively global models included river aggr and log10 fi ar as fixed factors and imp as a random factor table 4 shannon h values were positively skewed and log10 transformed shannon h 1 prior to analysis which reduced but did not eliminate the skew due to a relatively high number of 0 values hence interpretation of parameter estimates should be made with caution the model reduction procedures led to exclusion of river for the species model glmm and exclusion of river log10 fi ar and the random factor imp for the diversity model turning it from a lmm to a lm see supplementary material table s1 s2 the final species model was not significantly overdispersed dispersion 0 77 p 0 42 broader environmental effects as described by the two extracted nmds axes on number of species caught and diversity shannon h were modelled using poisson glmm glm and lmm lm respectively global models included river nmds1 nmds2 and log10 fi ar as fixed factors and imp as a random factor table 4 the factors nmds1 and nmds2 were fitted as second order polynomials and the interaction between nmds terms was included in lme4 syntax poly nmds1 2 poly nmds2 2 as in previous analyses shannon h values were log10 transformed shannon h 1 the purpose of the modelling was descriptive rather than a test of a specific hypothesis hence all terms were allowed to be removed in the model reduction the final reduced models for both number of species caught and shannon diversity included poly nmds1 2 and log10 fi ar no overdispersion of the reduced poisson model was indicated dispersion 0 65 p 0 80 for model reduction details see supplementary material table s3 s4 absence of a species or presence of only single species led to pielou s evenness j not being applicable to a substantial proportion of the sites n 9 therefore no models were constructed for this index instead pielou data are graphed in relation to nmds scores with tendencies evaluated based on loess regression and spearman rank correlations 2 7 5 broader environmental effects on fish densities in tributary mouths environmental effects as described by the two extracted nmds axes on densities of fish were modelled using lmm lm fish densities were transformed as log10 density 1 and analysed for six different groupings of species i all fish species combined ii tolerant species iii intolerant species iv benthic species v rheophilic species and vi species included in the swedish red list see table 3 for group classifications global models included river nmds1 and nmds2 as fixed factors and imp as a random factor nmds1 and nmds2 were fitted as second order polynomials and their interaction was included as described for previous analyses all factors were allowed to be removed in the model reduction see reduction procedure in supplementary material table s5 s10 the final reduced models were constructed as follows all species log10 density 1 nmds1 nmds2 tolerant species log10 density 1 1 intercept only intolerant species log10 density 1 poly nmds1 2 river benthic species log10

ratio tests to assess their fit to the data densities were also investigated specifically in relation to nmds1 using loess regression 2 7 6 differences between tributary mouth and upstream tributary sites to compare average species richness between 0k and 1k sites within tributaries a glmm poisson log link was used to model species count as dependent on site fixed factor and trib random intercept no overdispersion was indicated dispersion 1 08 p 0 66 the same model structure was used in a lmm to model shannon diversity h using log10 transformed data shannon h 1 sign tests two sided were used to compare changes positive or negative in species richness and shannon h for 0k and 1k sites 3 results 3 1 captured fish fauna in total 12 species of fish 11 bony fishes and 1 lamprey were recorded

rainbow trout o mykiss and brook charr s fontinalis were only caught in the lule river system and only at one 1k site each o mykiss n 1 204 mm tl likely originated from an aquaculture net pen in an

ordination of environmental variables in the tributary mouth areas resulted in a final stress value of 0 085 indicating a good ordination in combination with the shepard plot derived from the analysis fig s1 clarke 1993 the first nmds axis nmds1 largely ordered sites along a substrate size and water velocity gradient with high values being associated with large substrate sizes and high velocity and low values with small sized substrate fig 2a other features like turbidity shallow areas and embayment to some extent loaded in the same direction as small substrates as did the binary classification of aggradation status modelling nmds1 scores as dependent on binary classified aggradation status revealed that nmds1 did not differ significantly between sites classified as aggrading and non aggrading although a tendency for aggrading sites having lower values was seen anova f 1 17 3 06 p 0 098 fig 2b the second nmds axis nmds2 was mainly described by the presence of protruding boulders loading in the negative direction of the axis and sandy to small cobble substrates and aggradation status loading in the positive direction of the axis fig 2a modelling nmds2 scores as dependent on their binary classified aggradation status revealed that nmds2 significantly differed between sites classified as aggrading and non aggrading anova f 1 17 8 04 p 0 011 fig 2c 3 3 nuisance factors for species abundance for 0k sites channel width did not have a significant effect on the number of species caught log10 ch wi z 1 494 p 0 135 but mean annual discharge and fished area had positive effects log10 mq z 2 802 p 0 005 log10 fi ar z 1 987 p 0 047 fig s2a d for 1k sites channel width and fished area had significant effects on number of species caught log10 ch wi z 2 319 p 0 020 log10

strongly correlated with each other all r 0 7 all p 0 05 fig s3 hence these three variables appear to largely represent the same thing i e size of the tributary and since fished area consistently had a positive effect on number of species caught this variable was used in the more detailed modelling 3 4 environmental effects on fish diversity in tributary mouths models investigating effects of binary aggradation status of the tributary mouth area indicated no statistically significant effects on number of species anodev aggr χ 2 0 26 p 0 61 log10 fi ar χ2 1 67 p 0 20 fig s4a similarly no significant effect on diversity as indicated by shannon h was found anova aggr f 1 18 0 45 p 0 51 fig s4b the model for number of species indicated significant effects of the second order polynomial term poly nmds1 2 χ 2 15 8 p 0 001 and log10 fi ar χ 2 5 26 p 0 022 parameter estimates indicated a concave down relationship between number of species caught and nmds1 fig 3a parameter estimates β intercept 3 43 β nmds1 1 2 26 β nmds1 2 2 94 β log10 fi ar 1 56 as the first axis of the nmds generally relates to substrate classes and their associated habitat characteristics the pattern suggests that the intermediate substrate size is associated with the highest number of species the number of species caught also increases with fished area as also indicated in the previous analyses the factor nmds2 was not retained after model reduction indicating that it is not influential on the number of species present see relationship in fig s5a the model for shannon diversity h also indicated significant effects of the second order polynomial term poly nmds1 2 f2 15 5 49 p 0 016 and log10 fi ar f 1 15 5 71 p 0 030 parameter estimates indicated a concave down relationship with nmds1 fig 3b parameter estimates β intercept 0 47 β nmds1 1 0 25 β nmds1 2 0 28 β log10 fi ar 0 25 in accordance with number of species the pattern suggests that intermediate substrate size is associated with

with any of the investigated environmental variables nmds1 nmds 2 fi ar and ch wi with all spearman rank correlations having p 0 46 see fig s6 for details and visualization of loess regressions 3 5 broader environmental effects on fish densities in tributary mouths for the model of total fish density all species combined the factor nmds1 was significant indicating increasing density with increasing values of nmds1 fig 4 a while nmds2 was non significant table 6 based on the loess regression fit the significant positive relationship appears largely driven by low fish densities in sites dominated by fine sediment with associated environmental features i e sites with the lowest values on the nmds1 scale for all other sites no apparent trend was indicated in the loess fit fig 4a for tolerant species only four sites had tolerant species present fig 4b which is inadequate for modelling the influence of environmental factors the model selection procedure ended with selection of the intercept only model and hence no factors were specifically investigated table 6 in the model of intolerant species density the polynomials of nmds1 and river were retained in the model selection procedure which was designed to allow for some model complexity not always selecting the most parsimonious model and both terms were significant parameter estimates however indicate that the polynomial relationship with nmds1 is not significantly different from a linear fit table 6 fig 4c this is supported by the fact that neither a likelihood ratio test lrt nor aicc comparisons indicate that the fit of the polynomial model is significantly better than a linear fit lrt p 0 102 δaicc 0 64 loess regression suggests that the fit may be driven largely by a lack of intolerant species in the sites with the lowest nmds1 scores for sites with higher nmds1 scores 0 5 there is no trend and intolerant species densities vary substantially throughout this range fig 4c ume river had a lower fish density in general table 5 density of benthic species showed a concave down relationship with nmds1 table 6 fig 4d this pattern was also supported by the loess regression density of rheophilic species was modelled using a polynomial function of nmds1 and this model indicated a potential concave down relationship table 6 fig 4e while the polynomial fit is not obviously different from a positive linear fit both lrt and aicc comparisons of the models indicate that the fit of the polynomial model is significantly better lrt p 0 021 δaicc 2 04 similar to density of intolerant species which constitute a subset of the rheophilic species assessment of the loess regression suggests that the fit can be driven largely by the lack of rheophilic species in the sites with the lowest nmds1 scores an effect of river was also detected with ume river having a lower density of rheophilic species table 6 density of red listed species followed the same concave down relationship with nmds1 as the density of benthic species table 6 fig 4f this result is consistent with the fact that red listed species constitute a subset of the benthic species from a local conservation perspective presence of specific species in relation to habitat characteristics can be of importance hence we present a graphical representation of each species caught within this study in the appendix fig a1 3 6 differences between tributary mouth and upstream sites neither species richness nor shannon diversity differed significantly between 0k and 1k sites species richness z 1 542 p 0 123 shannon h t 1 546 p 0 139 fig 5 based on preliminary analyses of possible nuisance factors see above altitude was not considered in the models and further support for this decision is found in the lack of a correlation between the change in species richness or shannon h and the change in altitude δalt between 0k and 1k sites species richness r 0 267 p 0 269 shannon h r 0 173 p 0 479 sign tests comparing general

analyses above generally the species present at the mouth of the tributary were not the same species as encountered upstream fig a2 regressing change in species richness as dependent on the species richness at the 0k site gives a slope of 0 87 95 ci 0 50 1 23 which suggests a strong regression to the mean effect which could be due to a more or less random distribution of data for 0k and 1k sites e g barnett et al 2005 4 discussion the overall number of fish species present in the catchment areas of the rivers is substantially higher than the numbers observed in the tributary surveys typically only 2 or fewer species were detected at each tributary site hence the species diversity observed in the tributaries areas as indicated by the electrofishing catches does not support the notion that tributaries are hot spots for fish species diversity nevertheless when environmental conditions are favorable these areas may still be important for the biodiversity and ecology of the river systems for other reasons which we discuss below 4 1 fish biodiversity in relation to habitat characteristics tributary mouths characterized by intermediate sediment sizes gravel cobble had the highest α diversity species richness of fish the shannon diversity index which incorporates the relative abundance of the species present showed a similar pattern although not statistically significant areas dominated by the intermediate substrate sizes also tended to harbor higher densities of benthic species which generally may be favored by high environmental complexity possibly with the exception of brook lamprey l planeri which bury in finer sediments in line with this observation the two red listed species artdatabanken 2020 burbot l lota vu and alpine bullhead c poecilopus nt both benthic species showed higher densities at intermediate substrate sizes while abiotic effects often dictate the ecological community in freshwater ecosystems jackson et al 2001 a similar study from a more species rich river system in central europe found no clear detectable effects of habitat structure on species richness czeglédi et al 2016 the difference in effects suggests that the importance of local habitat may differ depending on biogeographical factors grenouillet et al 2004 and extrapolation of results outside of the investigated geographic region may be difficult our initial classification based on aggradation status i e presence absence of sediment plumes at the tributary mouth did not relate to any clear statistical differences in fish diversity this classification mainly predicted the pattern on the second nmds axis nmds2 and analyses including nmds2 instead of the binary aggradation class did not suggest any relationship between this axis and species richness or shannon h 4 2 fish abundance densities of fish in general increased with coarser substrate but it is not clear whether densities increase continuously with increasing sediment size nmds1 value or if there is a non linear saturating or step wise effect where densities increase from fine sediments to gravel substrate and then remain at a stable level with increasing substrate size as indicated by the non linear loess regression in fig 4a in many cases non linear effects in response to habitat complexity are expected soukup et al 2022 but more detailed investigations are needed to resolve this question species contributing to high densities in coarser substrate tributary mouth areas were rheophilic and intolerant to anthropogenic impacts these two guilds have largely overlapping species composition pont et al 2006 schmidt kloiber hering 2015 when large sized substrates dominate stream power streamflow slope is typically higher as compared to when smaller substrates dominate lane 1955 which can explain why occurrence of rheophilic species is higher at sites with higher values of nmds1 i e characterized by larger substrate with regards to two rheophilic taxa of national management concern the bullheads c poecilopus and c gobio and brown trout s trutta we noted that the former are found at their highest densities at intermediate nmds1 values cobble to gravel or even sandy habitats while the latter have their highest densities at high ndms1 values i e boulder habitats these patterns fit with previous observations in norwegian subalpine rivers hesthagen et al 2004 the differences in habitat preference for these two taxa which both are important for environmental management illustrate the importance of maintaining environmental variation across sites predominantly limnophilic species were not common in this study not even in slow flowing tributary mouths dominated by finer substrates slow flowing sites were generally shallow over substantial areas so for limnophilic species the main stems or lakes may be more suitable as habitats within the river systems moreover it was not possible to electrofish deep areas when they occurred and this may be biasing our results as indicated in other studies cooke et al 2012 limnophilic species may also be more mobile only inhabiting tributary mouth areas temporarily which decreases the probability of being caught during single electrofishing surveys seasonal and diel changes in habitat specific species composition have been described in several river systems copp jurajda 1999 nunn et al 2010 salas snyder 2010 hence a sampling over a broader period of time might have produced a different picture of fish biodiversity in tributary mouths 4 3 fish α and γ diversity in broader context the number of fish species found in each tributary mouth ranged between 0 and 6 typically 2 or fewer indicating a generally low α diversity compared to the overall number of species known to be present in the river systems table 3 at sites located 1 km upstream of the tributary mouths species richness ranged between 0 and 4 but without any clear decline within a given tributary furthermore the species present generally differed between the mouth and the upstream site in the tributaries hence the species found in the upstream areas are not typically a subset of the species present in the mouth area but may constitute a different type of community to some extent these findings contrast with results from central europe where a decline in tributary fish α diversity could be detected from the mouth to sites located 1 km upstream czeglédi et al 2016 but studies over a larger geographic area are probably needed to draw such a conclusion low species richness likely reflects the overall γ diversity in these boreal rivers only 24 species in total are known from the two investigated river systems table 3 out of which four are not expected in the survey areas due to downstream migration barriers a anguilla s salar l fluviatilis or alpine distributional limits s alpinus considering that the α diversity at a given tributary mouth area constitutes only 0 30 of the expected γ diversity and that no systematic differences were found between mouth and upstream sites it is nevertheless questionable at best whether the tributary mouth areas can be considered biodiversity hot spots for fish in these river systems these results contrast with studies from e g neotropical rivers where tributaries are often found to be hot spots for fish diversity marques et al 2018 azevedo santos et al 2020 vasconcelos et al 2021 da luz soares et al 2022 however the neotropical rivers have a much higher taxonomic richness and functional specialization of fishes overall due to comparatively long historical stability on an evolutionary time scale rodrigues filho et al 2018 which may explain the differences 4 4 caveats and future research requirements the present study focuses on tributary mouth fish diversity in impounded boreal rivers in sweden as assessed from electrofishing surveys as such the study constitutes an initial insight into the fish diversity in these areas but some key information is still missing especially for designing appropriate management action for instance the study does not provide information about the biodiversity in unimpacted reference systems to gain this knowledge future studies could survey the tributaries in the few remaining unimpacted boreal rivers or river sections in europe surveys in the present study did not include biodiversity in the main stems due to lack of comparable methods between shallow tributaries and deep habitats in the main stem boat electrofishing could be considered in future studies but differences in species specific capture bias between wading and boat electrofishing present a large problem for comparisons furthermore efficient boat electrofishing is only possible to a depth of a couple of meters making it difficult to survey the main stem fish fauna representatively hence our conclusion that the tributary mouth areas are not hot spots for fish biodiversity in these two regulated rivers is based on a general qualitative comparison with the overall number of species known to be present in the main stems surveys conducted at different times is another focus area that could be approached in future studies to improve our knowledge about the importance of tributary mouth areas as habitat many juvenile species use the shallower habitats mainly at night copp jurajda 1999 and given that we only have survey data from daytime here information about this is currently lacking these studies would likely require a different survey method since wading electrofishing at night can be hazardous environmental dna metabarcoding surveys could detect more species but detailed studies of tributary mouth biodiversity may be obfuscated by dna contamination from upstream sections david et al 2021 nevertheless edna metabarcoding may give insights into short term changes in species presence other survey methods like e g snorkeling transects trapping or possibly seining may be better suited all of which however may be primarily applicable in deep slow flowing areas similarly we do not have information about usage of these habitats during spring summer or winter and seasonal differences have at least been detected in a similar study from a more species rich system in central europe czeglédi et al 2016 future studies extending on the present results should incorporate a wider temporal coverage 4 5 management considerations while tributary mouth areas in general were found to be relatively species poor several rheophilic species found in these areas are disfavored in impounded rivers since their typical habitats riffles and rapids are often either inundated or completely or partially dried out when eliminated modified or bypassed by hydropower infrastructure malm renöfält et al 2010 göthe et al 2019 widén et al 2021 to maintain as high ecological potential as possible in these river systems natural tributary mouths characterized by flowing habitats and medium to large sediment substrate could be protected from further anthropogenic impacts as they may constitute near main stem refuges for rheophilic species where degraded e g by dams or culverts near the confluence these types of habitats could also be rehabilitated or restored these actions would be in line with the european water framework directive directive 2000 60 ec and national river restoration goals associated with the european biodiversity strategy for 2030 to promote the currently red listed species present in the area l lota and c poecilopus habitat measures may consist of ensuring a medium sized sediment habitat habitat restoration efforts in swedish boreal rivers typically promote brown trout habitats i e coarser sediment habitats degerman näslund 2021 which might disfavor bullhead given the apparent competition between trout and bullheads hesthagen et al 2004 tributary mouth areas could possibly be appropriate target areas for re creating intermediate sediment size habitats and trout may instead be targeted in the upstream areas of the tributaries also the burbot might find a refuge from negative temperatures flows and pollution in the main stem stapanian et al 2010 dugdale et al 2013 koizumi et al 2013 artdatabanken 2020 wang et al 2020 to promote γ diversity in river systems at large we need to collect and compile knowledge about the diversity patterns in these rivers e g how different species are distributed through river networks it could in fact be important to maintain a range of different types of tributary mouths to benefit a wide variety of species with different habitat requirements management activities must also consider other taxa than fish including invertebrates plants semi aquatic vertebrates etc in both the aquatic environment and the riparian zone restorative measures gain cumulative value if considered on a catchment scale rather than local efforts gann et al 2019 cid et al 2022 therefore when a pristine reference state is unachievable a combination of measures could be suggested for example reconstruction of road culverts at the tributary mouth will likely lead to a more natural flow regime with associated sediment dynamics widén et al 2016 and recreating natural stream morphology with riparian zones in currently straightened and channelized sections of tributaries will likely reduce erosion and unnatural transport of fine sediment to the tributary mouths beschta platts 1986 both measures may also help retain the water in the tributary to avoid negative effects of drought on the ecosystem 5 conclusions with this study we have gained information about the diversity of fish in tributary mouth areas within large impounded boreal river systems we found that fish species richness and diversity were relatively low but variable with variation being primarily explained by habitat features related to sediment grain size highest diversity was found in mouths with intermediate grain size gravel cobble fine sediment habitats often contained few if any fish species during the time of our surveys the species composition at the mouth was generally not the same as upstream the tributary nor were the species present upstream a subset of the species at the mouth overall we find no clear evidence supporting that the tributary mouth areas are biodiversity hot spot for fishes in relatively species

927,large boreal rivers in sweden are generally impounded by hydropower dams and a large proportion of main stem shallow flowing habitats have been lost tributaries often contain the last undisturbed habitats and could be important for the conservation of species diversity in particular tributary mouth areas could be biodiversity hot spots due to their vicinity to the main stem and favorable environmental conditions in this study we investigate whether tributary mouth areas in two impounded boreal rivers ume river and lule river could be regarded as biodiversity hot spots for fish based on standardized electrofishing in 20 tributary mouths we find that overall fish diversity is generally low the highest species richness and diversity was found in mouth areas dominated by intermediate substrate sizes gravel cobble few if any species were found in areas where fine sediments smaller than sand dominated the tributary mouth areas had similar species richness and diversity as areas in the tributaries located 1 km upstream of the mouth but the fish community composition often differed between these two types of sites management action favoring fish diversity in the tributary mouth areas could include protection or rehabilitation of areas dominated by medium sized substrate and reduction of erosion and transport of fine sediments in the tributaries overall we find no support for tributary mouths being hot spots for fish biodiversity and while some patterns in diversity gives hints on suitable management action it is important to further understand impacts in tributaries and their mouths and the temporal dynamics of the fish community keywords aggradation boreal rivers fish biodiversity river morphology river sediment size tributary confluence 1 introduction large rivers are important ecosystems for aquatic biodiversity typically housing a higher fish biodiversity than smaller rivers with some species being adapted specifically for habitats characteristic of these larger systems jackson et al 2001 oberdorff et al 2011 miranda et al 2019 the biodiversity of many of these large ecosystems has been negatively impacted during the last century as they have been heavily exploited for many purposes including energy production grill et al 2019 while damming of main stem rivers can secure large amounts of affordable energy for society rex et al 2014 schäfer 2021 damming also disrupts longitudinal connectivity and alters hydrological hydrogeomorphological and thermal conditions baxter 1977 ligon et al 1995 vörösmarty et al 2010 anderson et al 2015 the result is spatially and seasonally homogenized slow flowing river sections between dams with severely disrupted connection among them which reduces their overall biodiversity poff et al 2007 malm renöfält et al 2010 the northern european large rivers discharging into the baltic sea are today generally exploited for large scale hydropower production with only a few remaining in a completely or near free flowing state dynesius nilsson 1994 grill et al 2019 in sweden hydropower development in these baltic rivers was initiated in the early to mid 1900s without much regard to the ecology of the river ecosystems and today constitute the most important source of hydropower in the country ödmann et al 1982 schäfer 2021 with national and international legal requirements for sustainable hydropower gos 2020 and riverine ecosystem functioning ec 2000 the pressure to restore riverine biodiversity and processes is high sweden is a net exporter of energy with hydropower making up an important proportion of the energy production and sources of renewable energy are increasingly important in light of climate change sea 2021 hence while complete restoration to reference conditions is unfeasible in these heavily modified rivers rehabilitation measures and mitigation of continued biodiversity loss are still required to secure a good ecological potential ec 2000 2020 gos 2020 such management action however requires much information about the current ecological state of different areas in relation to their hydro and geomorphology so that restoration and rehabilitiation measures can be optimally directed to those with the strongest positive effects on biodiversity e g borg et al 2007 jansson et al 2007 renschler et al 2007 widén et al 2016 tributaries to large impounded rivers often have a lower degree of habitat alteration and more natural sediment transport flow dynamics and temperature regimes as compared to the main stem given that they themselves are not impounded rice et al 2008 ziv et al 2012 pracheil et al 2013 marques et al 2018 vasconcelos et al 2021 protection of unaltered tributaries and restoration of ecologically degraded tributaries could thereby retain or improve the remaining ecological values of impounded large rivers focus on this potential source of biodiversity has mainly been proposed for large tributaries in very large river systems ziv et al 2012 pracheil et al 2013 dunn paukert 2021 where network dispersal extensive upstream dispersal in tributaries is more likely than in small tributaries grenoulliet et al 2004 nevertheless similar effects may also be achievable in smaller systems where the main stem tributary movements of species mainly relates to confluence exchange localized movements near confluences if conditions are favorable rice et al 2008 thornbrugh gido 2010 laub et al 2018 the confluence areas of tributaries mouth and the main stem have previously been described as important for habitat heterogeneity and biodiversity in the main stem due to e g aggradation concentrated nutrient flow favorable thermal and chemical conditions and environmental features allowing prey species to shelter from large sized predators power dietrich 2002 wipfli gregovich 2002 kiffney et al 2006 rice et al 2006 tributary confluences can indeed constitute significant biological hot spots in riverine ecosystems power dietrich 2002 benda et al 2004 kiffney et al 2006 the value of tributaries for biodiversity is particularly pronounced in e g species rich neotropical river systems e g marques et al 2018 azevedo santos et al 2020 vasconcelos et al 2021 da luz soares et al 2022 but the pattern could potentially be the same in relatively species poor boreal river systems previous studies have shown that species richness of benthic invertebrate fauna is high at tributary confluences in reaches below impoundments in the main stem e g greenwood et al 1999 vinson 2001 but see milner et al 2019 studies of fish also suggest that species richness can be higher in tributary segments near main stem confluences thornbrugh gido 2009 miranda et al 2019 and that these areas can be important spawning areas for fish da luz soares et al 2022 these patterns make tributary mouths possible focal areas for 1 conservative management plans when intact 2 restorative actions when degraded or 3 ecological compensation measures when the main stem is degraded and there is still potential to increase biodiversity allan castillo 2007 rice et al 2008 erkinaro et al 2017 sandin et al 2017 miranda et al 2019 the tributaries themselves i e sections upstream from the mouth often have lower species richness than the main stem czeglédi et al 2016 miranda et al 2019 but can nevertheless be important for biodiversity in the river network for instance tributaries can be highly heterogeneous in terms of flow and environmental features offering a variety of habitats jackson et al 2001 wohl 2017 they also offer refuge from extreme temperature and flow events in the main stem contain spawning grounds or juvenile habitat and create migration corridors between the main stem and upstream lakes and smaller streams jackson et al 2001 fausch et al 2002 meyer et al 2007 rice et al 2008 wohl 2017 management action to improve habitats in the main stems of these rivers are often costly and incongruous with hydropower production at least with high production but measures in their tributaries may be more feasible from a socio economic perspective hence tributaries and the tributary mouth areas in particular are possibly key target areas for restoration and rehabilitation activities the aim of this study was to provide baseline information about fish biodiversity in tributary mouths in two heavily impounded boreal rivers in northern sweden ume and lule river both of which are classified as strongly affected by fragmentation dynesius nilsson 1994 we investigate the effects of some key environmental characteristics hydrogeomorphology and bottom substrate of tributary mouth areas on the fish fauna composition more specifically we aimed to 1 assess the number of species and diversity of fish in tributary mouth areas to collect initial data on whether these areas could be viewed as fish biodiversity hot spots i e in relation to the known species in the main stem 2 investigate which tributary mouth habitats are the richest in fish diversity and abundance with particular focus on sites dominated by erosional non aggraded vs depositional aggraded processes 3 investigate the association of different fish guilds to habitat characteristics in tributary mouth areas 4 compare diversity in tributary mouth areas with sites located further upstream in the tributaries ca 1 km upstream of the confluence 2 materials and methods 2 1 survey areas the surveyed tributaries belong to two large swedish boreal rivers ume river and lule river fig 1 located in the svecofennian orogen province of the baltic shield both rivers transverse the country in a northwest southeast direction starting in the alpine region near norway and draining into the baltic sea bothnian sea and gulf of bothnia respectively the rivers are of similar size table 1 have similar hydro climatic variation within their catchments smhi 2022 and have multiple hydropower impoundments along a large portion of each river fig 1 in the downstream parts of both rivers power production follows a run of the river scheme with the flow being regulated by storage reservoirs in the upper parts of the catchments the tributaries included in this study were limited to the region between the first hydroelectric dam from the sea and the highest coastal line after the weichselian glaciation so as to be able to work with comparable fish communities in this geographical area the river margins of both rivers are dominated by erosion sensitive materials sandy substrates in the more upstream sections with an increased occurrence and dominance of silt and flood sediments as the rivers flow further downstream sgi 2022 much of the surrounding land consists of moraine glacial river sediments and peat sgu 2022 tributaries in ume river were distributed over a main stem distance of 84 km most downstream tributary located 30 km from the sea and tributaries in lule river were distributed over a main stem distance of 104 km most downstream tributary located 50 km from the sea fig 1 2 2 site selection tributaries entering ume and lule rivers have mouth areas that can be broadly classified as either aggrading or non aggrading based on the presence or absence of sediment plumes at the confluence using digital aerial map surveys from public web services https maps google se https eniro se we identified candidate tributary mouths based on the aerial photographs extracted information on mean discharge mq for each candidate from the s hype model of national hydrological statistics bergstrand et al 2014 and thereafter selected a set of tributaries along a wide range of mq for both confluence types impoundments with only one type of tributary aggrading non aggrading were excluded and tributaries assessed as too deep for wading or culverted or dammed directly at the mouth were not considered from the candidate set we selected tributaries so that each confluence type was represented by equal numbers of streams 5 of each type in each of the two rivers covering similar ranges of mq assessment of tributary mouth type was also made in the field see 2 5 environmental survey methodology and final designation was based on the combined information the selected tributaries were located in two impoundments in ume river and three impoundments in lule river table 2 2 3 fish communities fish communities in the two river systems are similar table 3 the main differences are the absence of alpine bullhead cottus poecilopus in ume river records and the absence of river lamprey lampetra fluviatilis in lule river records gbif 2020 river lamprey however does not occur upstream of the first dam in ume river anadromous salmonids atlantic salmon salmo salar and brown trout s trutta can use a fishway to pass the same dam reaching the most downstream surveyed impoundment of ume river but are either not expected in the survey area s salar which mainly migrates up the large tributary vindel river or have local non migratory populations s trutta making species presence effectively equivalent in both rivers arctic charr salvelinus alpinus mainly occurs in the alpine region of the catchments and populations in the lower parts are likely stocked into lakes and hence not expected in the river tributaries two non native salmonid species are present in the area rainbow trout oncorhynchus mykiss and brook charr salvelinus fontinalis the former does not reproduce and stems from unintentional escape events from aquaculture net pens the latter was intentionally introduced during the 19 20th centuries and established in some tributaries with respect to historical electrofishing data lule river is less surveyed than ume river table 1 sers 2020 however the sources of presence absence data for the catchments include more than electrofishing surveys lundberg 1899 ekman 1922 widén et al 2016 gbif 2020 and the species list is in accordance with recent national distribution maps kullander et al 2012 for each species we collected additional information about tolerance red list status classification of the extinction risk of a given species within a specified geographic area and habitat preference tolerance reflecting species sensitivity to impacts related to altered flow regime nutrient regime habitat structure and water chemistry was based on assignments within the european fish index fame consortium 2004 pont et al 2006 red list status was obtained from the most recent lists of sweden artdatabanken 2020 and europe iucn 2020 feeding habitat and rheophily were obtained from the freshwaterecology info database schmidt kloiber hering 2015 we modified the classification of brook charr to rheophilic eurytopic in the database this species is eurytopic in its native distribution range in north america scott crossman 1973 but naturalized swedish populations are primarily found in headwater streams kullander et al 2012 2 4 fish survey methods multipass wading electrofishing surveys were conducted once at each site in autumn august september by professional electrofishing consultants equipment straight dc bank side aggregates lug ab l 1000 luleå 700 800 v 0 3 0 4 a following swedish standard practices the so called three pass protocol bergquist et al 2014 in each tributary one site at the tributary mouth i e near the confluence with the main stem and one site located 1 km upstream of the mouth were electrofished fished areas ranged between 55 and 760 m2 depending on the size of the tributary smaller areas in smaller tributaries and vice versa see fig s3 and environmental characteristics limiting electrofishing at sites with deep sections the survey was limited to the wadable section along one of the banks in line with swedish standard methodology one upstream site remained unfished as it was too deep for wading when visited for each electrofishing pass at a given site all fish caught were counted identified to species and measured for length and mass 2 5 environmental survey methodology coordinated with the electrofishing survey a standardized environmental survey was conducted at each site following the swedish electrofishing protocol bergquist et al 2014 within this protocol the dominant sediment types in the top layer of the bottom substrate are classified by ocular inspection atcross channel transects which are located every 10 meters along the survey site from the overall survey site data the three most dominant sediment classes are summarized into an ordinal scale relating to overall coverage d1 d3 with associated classification of areal coverage see figure text to fig 2 which provides a coarse but generally accurate picture of the general sediment dynamics fine scale sediment cover data is however not available in addition a more detailed investigation of the tributary mouths was made in association to a parallel study on vascular plants in and around the same tributaries r jansson b malm renöfält in prep based on field observations each mouth area was classified as 1 aggrading or non aggrading 2 sheltered or non sheltered 3 situated in an embayment or not 4 having boulders protruding above the water surface at low flow or not and 5 having shallow fine sediment areas 1 m deep from high water level sand or finer substrate 5 m2 area or not altitude for each site was obtained from 2 m

values higher diversity based on h pielou s evenness j pielou 1966 was also calculated dividing h with h max as a measure of how close the number of individuals of each species are to each other at a

linear mixed models lmm generalized linear models glm and generalized linear mixed models glmm for statistical models with more than a single factor table 4 the initial global models specified below were reduced based on the relative akaike information criterion modified for small sample size aicc of all subordinate models including the global model and the intercept only model using the mumin r package bartoń 2020 to avoid uninfluential factors and thereby increase the residual degrees of freedom to reduce the risk of excluding influential factors the most complex model within two aicc units from the most parsimonious model was used for interpretation when models were run as poisson regressions i e for count data overdispersion was tested using a one sided dharma nonparametric dispersion test hartig 2021 if significant overdispersion was indicated glms were re constructed as quasi poisson regressions ver hoef boveng 2007 and glmms were fitted with an additional observation level random effect harrison 2014 mixed models were constructed using the lme4 r package bates et al 2020 marginal means and contrasts were obtained using the emmeans r package lenth 2021 and data processing and visualization were done within the tidyverse suite for r wickham et al 2019 2 7 2 dimension reduction of habitat variables in tributary mouths to characterize and summarize habitat features in the tributary mouths we conducted a non metric multidimensional scaling nmds analysis using the vegan r package oksanen et al 2019 habitat variables included i ordinal ranks of nine different sediment classes ii aggradation status aggrading non aggrading iii presence absence of protruding boulders iv presence absence of shallow areas v binary classification of embayment vi binary classification of whether or not the mouth was sheltered vii ordinal rank of water turbidity and viii ordinal rank of flow velocity see fig 2 for a key to the variables we extracted two dimensions k 2 based on bray curtis dissimilarity results were centred and half scaled variation was maximized in the first dimension by principal component rotation stress value was derived based on the type i approach weak ties 2 7 3 nuisance factors for species abundance initially we ran a suite of simple one factor poisson glms to investigate factors suspected based on previous studies to generally influence species abundance in the catches at the 0k and 1k sites to make informed decisions on whether or not to include any of the factors in the construction of models specified below factors

in number of species and diversity shannon h between aggrading and non aggrading tributary mouth areas were tested using poisson glmm glm and lmm lm respectively global models included river aggr and log10 fi ar as fixed factors and imp as a random factor table 4 shannon h values were positively skewed and log10 transformed shannon h 1 prior to analysis which reduced but did not eliminate the skew due to a relatively high number of 0 values hence interpretation of parameter estimates should be made with caution the model reduction procedures led to exclusion of river for the species model glmm and exclusion of river log10 fi ar and the random factor imp for the diversity model turning it from a lmm to a lm see supplementary material table s1 s2 the final species model was not significantly overdispersed dispersion 0 77 p 0 42 broader environmental effects as described by the two extracted nmds axes on number of species caught and diversity shannon h were modelled using poisson glmm glm and lmm lm respectively global models included river nmds1 nmds2 and log10 fi ar as fixed factors and imp as a random factor table 4 the factors nmds1 and nmds2 were fitted as second order polynomials and the interaction between nmds terms was included in lme4 syntax poly nmds1 2 poly nmds2 2 as in previous analyses shannon h values were log10 transformed shannon h 1 the purpose of the modelling was descriptive rather than a test of a specific hypothesis hence all terms were allowed to be removed in the model reduction the final reduced models for both number of species caught and shannon diversity included poly nmds1 2 and log10 fi ar no overdispersion of the reduced poisson model was indicated dispersion 0 65 p 0 80 for model reduction details see supplementary material table s3 s4 absence of a species or presence of only single species led to pielou s evenness j not being applicable to a substantial proportion of the sites n 9 therefore no models were constructed for this index instead pielou data are graphed in relation to nmds scores with tendencies evaluated based on loess regression and spearman rank correlations 2 7 5 broader environmental effects on fish densities in tributary mouths environmental effects as described by the two extracted nmds axes on densities of fish were modelled using lmm lm fish densities were transformed as log10 density 1 and analysed for six different groupings of species i all fish species combined ii tolerant species iii intolerant species iv benthic species v rheophilic species and vi species included in the swedish red list see table 3 for group classifications global models included river nmds1 and nmds2 as fixed factors and imp as a random factor nmds1 and nmds2 were fitted as second order polynomials and their interaction was included as described for previous analyses all factors were allowed to be removed in the model reduction see reduction procedure in supplementary material table s5 s10 the final reduced models

ratio tests to assess their fit to the data densities were also investigated specifically in relation to nmds1 using loess regression 2 7 6 differences between tributary mouth and upstream tributary sites to compare average species richness between 0k and 1k sites within tributaries a glmm poisson log link was used to model species count as dependent on site fixed factor and trib random intercept no overdispersion was indicated dispersion 1 08 p 0 66 the same model structure was used in a lmm to model shannon diversity h using log10 transformed data shannon h 1 sign tests two sided were used to compare changes positive or negative in species richness and shannon h for 0k and 1k sites 3 results 3 1 captured fish fauna in total 12 species of fish 11 bony fishes and 1 lamprey were recorded

ordination of environmental variables in the tributary mouth areas resulted in a final stress value of 0 085 indicating a good ordination in combination with the shepard plot derived from the analysis fig s1 clarke 1993 the first nmds axis nmds1 largely ordered sites along a substrate size and water velocity gradient with high values being associated with large substrate sizes and high velocity and low values with small sized substrate fig 2a other features like turbidity shallow areas and embayment to some extent loaded in the same direction as small substrates as did the binary classification of aggradation status modelling nmds1 scores as dependent on binary classified aggradation status revealed that nmds1 did not differ significantly between sites classified as aggrading and non aggrading although a tendency for aggrading sites having lower values was seen anova f 1 17 3 06 p 0 098 fig 2b the second nmds axis nmds2 was mainly described by the presence of protruding boulders loading in the negative direction of the axis and sandy to small cobble substrates and aggradation status loading in the positive direction of the axis fig 2a modelling nmds2 scores as dependent on their binary classified aggradation status revealed that nmds2 significantly differed between sites classified as aggrading and non aggrading anova f 1 17 8 04 p 0 011 fig 2c 3 3 nuisance factors for species abundance for 0k sites channel width did not have a significant effect on the number of species caught log10 ch wi z 1 494 p 0 135 but mean annual discharge and fished area had positive

strongly correlated with each other all r 0 7 all p 0 05 fig s3 hence these three variables appear to largely represent the same thing i e size of the tributary and since fished area consistently had a positive effect on number of species caught this variable was used in the more detailed modelling 3 4 environmental effects on fish diversity in tributary mouths models investigating effects of binary aggradation status of the tributary mouth area indicated no statistically significant effects on number of species anodev aggr χ 2 0 26 p 0 61 log10 fi ar χ2 1 67 p 0 20 fig s4a similarly no significant effect on diversity as indicated by shannon h was found anova aggr f 1 18 0 45 p 0 51 fig s4b the model for number of species indicated significant effects of the second order polynomial term poly nmds1 2 χ 2 15 8 p 0 001 and log10 fi ar χ 2 5 26 p 0 022 parameter estimates indicated a concave down relationship between number of species caught and nmds1 fig 3a parameter estimates β intercept 3 43 β nmds1 1 2 26 β nmds1 2 2 94 β log10 fi ar 1 56 as the first axis of the nmds generally relates to substrate classes and their associated habitat characteristics the pattern suggests that the intermediate substrate size is associated with the highest number of species the number of species caught also increases with fished area as also indicated in the previous analyses the factor nmds2 was not retained after model reduction indicating that it is not influential on the number of species present see relationship in fig s5a the model for shannon diversity h also indicated significant effects of the second order polynomial term poly nmds1 2 f2 15 5 49 p 0 016 and log10 fi ar f 1 15 5 71 p 0 030 parameter estimates indicated a concave down relationship with nmds1 fig 3b parameter estimates β intercept 0 47 β nmds1 1 0 25 β nmds1 2 0 28 β log10 fi ar 0 25 in accordance with number of species the pattern suggests that intermediate substrate size is associated with

with any of the investigated environmental variables nmds1 nmds 2 fi ar and ch wi with all spearman rank correlations having p 0 46 see fig s6 for details and visualization of loess regressions 3 5 broader environmental effects on fish densities in tributary mouths for the model of total fish density all species combined the factor nmds1 was significant indicating increasing density with increasing values of nmds1 fig 4 a while nmds2 was non significant table 6 based on the loess regression fit the significant positive relationship appears largely driven by low fish densities in sites dominated by fine sediment with associated environmental features i e sites with the lowest values on the nmds1 scale for all other sites no apparent trend was indicated in the loess fit fig 4a for tolerant species only four sites had tolerant species present fig 4b which is inadequate for modelling the influence of environmental factors the model selection procedure ended with selection of the intercept only model and hence no factors were specifically investigated table 6 in the model of intolerant species density the polynomials of nmds1 and river were retained in the model selection procedure which was designed to allow for some model complexity not always selecting the most parsimonious model and both terms were significant parameter estimates however indicate that the polynomial relationship with nmds1 is not significantly different from a linear fit table 6 fig 4c this is supported by the fact that neither a likelihood ratio test lrt nor aicc comparisons indicate that the fit of the polynomial model is significantly better than a linear fit lrt p 0 102 δaicc 0 64 loess regression suggests that the fit may be driven largely by a lack of intolerant species in the sites with the lowest nmds1 scores for sites with higher nmds1 scores 0 5 there is no trend and intolerant species densities vary substantially throughout this range fig 4c ume river had a lower fish density in general table 5 density of benthic species showed a concave down relationship with nmds1 table 6 fig 4d this pattern was also supported by the loess regression density of rheophilic species was modelled using a polynomial function of nmds1 and this model indicated a potential concave down relationship table 6 fig 4e while the polynomial fit is not obviously different from a positive linear fit both lrt and aicc comparisons of the models indicate that the fit of the polynomial model is significantly better lrt p 0 021 δaicc 2 04 similar to density of intolerant species which constitute a subset of the rheophilic species assessment of the loess regression suggests that the fit can be driven largely by the lack of rheophilic species in the sites with the lowest nmds1 scores an effect of river was also detected with ume river having a lower density of rheophilic species table 6 density of red listed species followed the same concave down relationship with nmds1 as the density of benthic species table 6 fig 4f this result is consistent with the fact that red listed species constitute a subset of the benthic species from a local conservation perspective presence of specific species in relation to habitat characteristics can be of importance hence we present a graphical representation of each species caught within this study in the appendix fig a1 3 6

analyses above generally the species present at the mouth of the tributary were not the same species as encountered upstream fig a2 regressing change in species richness as dependent on the species richness at the 0k site gives a slope of 0 87 95 ci 0 50 1 23 which suggests a strong regression to the mean effect which could be due to a more or less random distribution of data for 0k and 1k sites e g barnett et al 2005 4 discussion the overall number of fish species present in the catchment areas of the rivers is substantially higher than the numbers observed in the tributary surveys typically only 2 or fewer species were detected at each tributary site hence the species diversity observed in the tributaries areas as indicated by the electrofishing catches does not support the notion that tributaries are hot spots for fish species diversity nevertheless when environmental conditions are favorable these areas may still be important for the biodiversity and ecology of the river systems for other reasons which we discuss below 4 1 fish biodiversity in relation to habitat characteristics tributary mouths characterized by intermediate sediment sizes gravel cobble had the highest α diversity species richness of fish the shannon diversity index which incorporates the relative abundance of the species present showed a similar pattern although not statistically significant areas dominated by the intermediate substrate sizes also tended to harbor higher densities of benthic species which generally may be favored by high environmental complexity possibly with the exception of brook lamprey l planeri which bury in finer sediments in line with this observation the two red listed species artdatabanken 2020 burbot l lota vu and alpine bullhead c poecilopus nt both benthic species showed higher densities at intermediate substrate sizes while abiotic effects often dictate the ecological community in freshwater ecosystems jackson et al 2001 a similar study from a more species rich river system in central europe found no clear detectable effects of habitat structure on species richness czeglédi et al 2016 the difference in effects suggests that the importance of local habitat may differ depending on biogeographical factors grenouillet et al 2004 and extrapolation of results outside of the investigated geographic region may be difficult our initial classification based on aggradation status i e presence absence of sediment plumes at the tributary mouth did not relate to any clear statistical differences in fish diversity this classification mainly predicted the pattern on the second nmds axis nmds2 and analyses including nmds2 instead of the binary aggradation class did not suggest any relationship between this axis and species richness or shannon h 4 2 fish abundance densities of fish in general increased with coarser substrate but it is not clear whether densities increase continuously with increasing sediment size nmds1 value or if there is a non linear saturating or step wise effect where densities increase from fine sediments to gravel substrate and then remain at a stable level with increasing substrate size as indicated by the non linear loess regression in fig 4a in many cases non linear effects in response to habitat complexity are expected soukup et al 2022 but more detailed investigations are needed to resolve this question species contributing to high densities in coarser substrate tributary mouth areas were rheophilic and intolerant to anthropogenic impacts these two guilds have largely overlapping species composition pont et al 2006 schmidt kloiber hering 2015 when large sized substrates dominate stream power streamflow slope is typically higher as compared to when smaller substrates dominate lane 1955 which can explain why occurrence of rheophilic species is higher at sites with higher values of nmds1 i e characterized by larger substrate with regards to two rheophilic taxa of national management concern the bullheads c poecilopus and c gobio and brown trout s trutta we noted that the former are found at their highest densities at intermediate nmds1 values cobble to gravel or even sandy habitats while the latter have their highest densities at high ndms1 values i e boulder habitats these patterns fit with previous observations in norwegian subalpine rivers hesthagen et al 2004 the differences in habitat preference for these two taxa which both are important for environmental management illustrate the importance of maintaining environmental variation across sites predominantly limnophilic species were not common in this study not even in slow flowing tributary mouths dominated by finer substrates slow flowing sites were generally shallow over substantial areas so for limnophilic species the main stems or lakes may be more suitable as habitats within the river systems moreover it was not possible to electrofish deep areas when they occurred and this may be biasing our results as indicated in other studies cooke et al 2012 limnophilic species may also be more mobile only inhabiting tributary mouth areas temporarily which decreases the probability of being caught during single electrofishing surveys seasonal and diel changes in habitat specific species composition have been described in several river systems copp jurajda 1999 nunn et al 2010 salas snyder 2010 hence a sampling over a broader period of time might have produced a different picture of fish biodiversity in tributary mouths 4 3 fish α and γ diversity in broader context the number of fish species found in each tributary mouth ranged between 0 and 6 typically 2 or fewer indicating a generally low α diversity compared to the overall number of species known to be present in the river systems table 3 at sites located 1 km upstream of the tributary mouths species richness ranged between 0 and 4 but without any clear decline within a given tributary furthermore the species present generally differed between the mouth and the upstream site in the tributaries hence the species found in the upstream areas are not typically a subset of the species present in the mouth area but may constitute a different type of community to some extent these findings contrast with results from central europe where a decline in tributary fish α diversity could be detected from the mouth to sites located 1 km upstream czeglédi et al 2016 but studies over a larger geographic area are probably needed to draw such a conclusion low species richness likely reflects the overall γ diversity in these boreal rivers only 24 species in total are known from the two investigated river systems table 3 out of which four are not expected in the survey areas due to downstream migration barriers a anguilla s salar l fluviatilis or alpine distributional limits s alpinus considering that the α diversity at a given tributary mouth area constitutes only 0 30 of the expected γ diversity and that no systematic differences were found between mouth and upstream sites it is nevertheless questionable at best whether the tributary mouth areas can be considered biodiversity hot spots for fish in these river systems these results contrast with studies from e g neotropical rivers where tributaries are often found to be hot spots for fish diversity marques et al 2018 azevedo santos et al 2020 vasconcelos et al 2021 da luz soares et al 2022 however the neotropical rivers have a much higher taxonomic richness and functional specialization of fishes overall due to comparatively long historical stability on an evolutionary time scale rodrigues filho et al 2018 which may explain the differences 4 4 caveats and future research requirements the present study focuses on tributary mouth fish diversity in impounded boreal rivers in sweden as assessed from electrofishing surveys as such the study constitutes an initial insight into the fish diversity in these areas but some key information is still missing especially for designing appropriate management action for instance the study does not provide information about the biodiversity in unimpacted reference systems to gain this knowledge future studies could survey the tributaries in the few remaining unimpacted boreal rivers or river sections in europe surveys in the present study did not include biodiversity in the main stems due to lack of comparable methods between shallow tributaries and deep habitats in the main stem boat electrofishing could be considered in future studies but differences in species specific capture bias between wading and boat electrofishing present a large problem for comparisons furthermore efficient boat electrofishing is only possible to a depth of a couple of meters making it difficult to survey the main stem fish fauna representatively hence our conclusion that the tributary mouth areas are not hot spots for fish biodiversity in these two regulated rivers is based on a general qualitative comparison with the overall number of species known to be present in the main stems surveys conducted at different times is another focus area that could be approached in future studies to improve our knowledge about the importance of tributary mouth areas as habitat many juvenile species use the shallower habitats mainly at night copp jurajda 1999 and given that we only have survey data from daytime here information about this is currently lacking these studies would likely require a different survey method since wading electrofishing at night can be hazardous environmental dna metabarcoding surveys could detect more species but detailed studies of tributary mouth biodiversity may be obfuscated by dna contamination from upstream sections david et al 2021 nevertheless edna metabarcoding may give insights into short term changes in species presence other survey methods like e g snorkeling transects trapping or possibly seining may be better suited all of which however may be primarily applicable in deep slow flowing areas similarly we do not have information about usage of these habitats during spring summer or winter and seasonal differences have at least been detected in a similar study from a more species rich system in central europe czeglédi et al 2016 future studies extending on the present results should incorporate a wider temporal coverage 4 5 management considerations while tributary mouth areas in general were found to be relatively species poor several rheophilic species found in these areas are disfavored in impounded rivers since their typical habitats riffles and rapids are often either inundated or completely or partially dried out when eliminated modified or bypassed by hydropower infrastructure malm renöfält et al 2010 göthe et al 2019 widén et al 2021 to maintain as high ecological potential as possible in these river systems natural tributary mouths characterized by flowing habitats and medium to large sediment substrate could be protected from further anthropogenic impacts as they may constitute near main stem refuges for rheophilic species where degraded e g by dams or culverts near the confluence these types of habitats could also be rehabilitated or restored these actions would be in line with the european water framework directive directive 2000 60 ec and national river restoration goals associated with the european biodiversity strategy for 2030 to promote the currently red listed species present in the area l lota and c poecilopus habitat measures may consist of ensuring a medium sized sediment habitat habitat restoration efforts in swedish boreal rivers typically promote brown trout habitats i e coarser sediment habitats degerman näslund 2021 which might disfavor bullhead given the apparent competition between trout and bullheads hesthagen et al 2004 tributary mouth areas could possibly be appropriate target areas for re creating intermediate sediment size habitats and trout may instead be targeted in the upstream areas of the tributaries also the burbot might find a refuge from negative temperatures flows and pollution in the main stem stapanian et al 2010 dugdale et al 2013 koizumi et al 2013 artdatabanken 2020 wang et al 2020 to promote γ diversity in river systems at large we need to collect and compile knowledge about the diversity patterns in these rivers e g how different species are distributed through river networks it could in fact be important to maintain a range of different types of tributary mouths to benefit a wide variety of species with different habitat requirements management activities must also consider other taxa than fish including invertebrates plants semi aquatic vertebrates etc in both the aquatic environment and the riparian zone restorative measures gain cumulative value if considered on a catchment scale rather than local efforts gann et al 2019 cid et al 2022 therefore when a pristine reference state is unachievable a combination of measures could be suggested for example reconstruction of road culverts at the tributary mouth will likely lead to a more natural flow regime with associated sediment dynamics widén et al 2016 and recreating natural stream morphology with riparian zones in currently straightened and channelized sections of tributaries will likely reduce erosion and unnatural transport of fine sediment to the tributary mouths beschta platts 1986 both measures may also help retain the water in the tributary to avoid negative effects of drought on the ecosystem 5 conclusions with this study we have gained information about the diversity of fish in tributary mouth areas within large impounded boreal river systems we found that fish species richness and diversity were relatively low but variable with variation being primarily explained by habitat features related to sediment grain size highest diversity was found in mouths with intermediate grain size gravel cobble fine sediment habitats often contained few if any fish species during the time of our surveys the species composition at the mouth was generally not the same as upstream the tributary nor were the species present upstream a subset of the species at the mouth overall we find no clear evidence supporting that the tributary mouth areas are biodiversity hot spot for fishes in relatively species

rivers streams lakes ponds wetlands as well as groundwater reid et al 2020 they play a fundamental ecological role and provide economically important products and services covich et al 2004 postel and carpenter 1997 in addition they provide critical habitats for a large variety of aquatic plants fishes reptiles birds and mammals nyingi et al 2013 however river ecosystems are influenced by changes at different spatial and temporal scales investigating these complex natural interactions provides context and guidance for simulating the impact of changes in the river ecosystem kiesel et al 2019 in nature river functioning is a complex organized system characterized by river flow sedimentation distribution of organic matter om organisms humans climate change and economic activity consequently ensuing habitat heterogeneity kovalchuk et al 2020 environmental heterogeneity in a river is formed by geomorphological units river basin vegetation sediment distribution and hydrological connectivity which plays an important role in the biodiversity and functioning of the river system palmer et al 2010 such heterogeneity forms natural mesohabitats visually distinct areas of habitat identifiable from banks to streams to river beds to vegetation along the river armitage et al 1995 armitage and pardo 1995 in river environment high biodiversity is commonly associated with mesohabitat silva et al

regular structures i e the rapid pool benchland system rpbs in the natural or semi natural rivers wang et al 2019 chen et al 2015 2014b 2014a the pool is a deeper habitat that is generally close to the bank while the benchland is formed by settling of sediment and other materials delivered by the river action and the rapid is generally seen in the middle line of the stream wang et al 2019 2014b 2014a these rpbs occur due to the geo physio dynamical variabilities and are also very important features for sustaining biological diversity especially in terms of beta diversity silva et al 2014 the macrobenthic invertebrate mbi communities are ubiquitous and abundant in most of the river ecosystem lópez lópez and sedeño díaz 2015 the mbi communities also play a critical role in the food chain by participating in the natural flow of energy and nutrients hauer and resh 2017 vannote et al 1980 wallace and webster 1996 in the last few decades mbi have been the most commonly used biological indicator selvanayagam and abril 2016 to assess the ecological status of the aquatic system as they have limited movement a relatively long life cycle mathuriau et al 2012 and a wide range of tolerance to environmental stressors lópez lópez and sedeño díaz 2015 the distribution and abundance of mbi often respond to the interaction of multiple environmental variables including discharge channel width river bed sediment size and anthropogenic activities consequently changing the taxonomic and functional diversity of local communities in addition mbi abundance and richness e g family richness have been widely used to detect environmental responses e g ferreira et al 2014 friberg et al 2011 rasifudi et al 2018 most riverine ecosystem studies focus on the changes in species and their functional relationships in various flow regimes biles et al 2003 cardinale et al 2002 comprehensive studies have been carried out on the mbi community structure and diversity pattern from riffles and pools system these include the effect of fine accumulated sediment harrison et al 2007 structure and functional organization of hyporheic communities jones and lim 2005 multi substratum sampling approach beauger and lair 2008 influence of visually assessment of mesohabitat silva et al 2014 and taxonomic trait structure herbst et al 2018 species and functional patterns of mbi in various flow regimes using multihabitat approach are also well documented fornaroli et al 2016 kemp et al 2000 however the abundance and distribution pattern of mbi and how the morphology and environmental variables influence it are poorly investigated in the rpbs further comparative studies on mbi in different mesohabitats are practically unknown from the warm temperate zone rivers to the best of our knowledge yet elucidating these patterns and biota environmental interactions is critical for management as anthropogenic and climate change impacts on ecosystems intensify it is recognized that studying riverine system with different habitat heterogeneity may be useful in determining the drivers of mbi community structure and function despite the high complexity of rpbs the differences in the mbi communities and the factors that govern the observed pattern have been scarcely explored the avoidance to study mesohabitat in the river by most freshwater benthic ecological researchers is due to the preference of the stable substrata rapid over unstable harrison et al 2007 the warm temperate zone river systems of china are extremely intricate and multifaceted systems however in recent years with population growth the expansion of industrial and agricultural activities and global climate change several ecological disturbances have been reported in many of the river systems of china han et al 2018 li et al 2020 liu et al 2021 wang et al 2019 xia et al 2020 despite the surge of interest in the warm temperate zone river system of china 27 192 searched articles web

climate change studies have not assessed and compared these interrelated impacts on the mbi of rpbs therefore in this study we focus on the rpbs from the five warm temperate zone rivers in the shaanxi province of northwest china the objectives of the present study are i to identify the factors influencing the mbi abundance and total number of taxa in the rpbs meoshabitats and ii to compare the total system and individual mesohabitat rpbs for mbi distribution we used the piecewise structural equation model to interpret the mechanisms driving this relationship 2 methodology 2 1 study area the study was conducted in the wei river basin 33o 59 35o 58 n and 106o 41 109o 32 e basin covers about 124 130 km2 fig 1 from shaanxi province of northwest china which falls under the warm temperate zone here the word temperate represents the areas with mild temperatures and this warm temperate zone is located in patches of western south central and eastern china due to its location in the arid and semi arid area of the northwest china the climate type is mainly continental monsoon and other seasons include cold and dry winter hot and rainy summer mild climate in spring and autumn the origin of the wei river is in the north of niaoshu mountain in gansu province which converges into the yellow river in xi an five rivers entailing feng chan ba wei and jing during the spring of 2019 april to july were selected for the present study the jing from the north feng chan and ba from the south form the wei river basin which is supported by the qinling mountain range in the north a total of 45 sites were identified based on the presence of rapid pool and benchland mesohabitats fig 2 at each site 2 2 river physical features the site positions were recorded with the help of gps horiba u 50 the major river physical features for the present study are river width rpbs length and width measurements fig s1 in the supplementary materials prior to the field sampling all the five rivers have been visited for identifying the rpbs availability in the system the rapid mesohabitat length measurements were considered from the beginning of the fast flowing water fp311 flow probe global water till where it dissipates the shallow water area with the high water velocity was marked for the measurements of rapid width the stream pool was firstly physically located later initial point of the slow water movement and rise in depth was considered as the starting point to measure the pool length while the end point was taken just before the beginning of riffle or runs each pool side which was parallel to the river bank with maximum area and depth was referenced for width measurements finally the biggest landmass closest to the river wet areas of the river bank or sandbars was considered for the sampling of the environmental biological and physical features during all the measurements there was always one person standing on the highest point of the bank side to guide and verify the shape of the systems the smaller systems were manually measured length and width in the larger mesohabitats where the manual measurements were not possible the reference points were taken by gps at each mesohabitat minimum 6 reference points were collected later all the measured distances were combined in the google earth system google earth pro 7 3 3 7786 each physical feature had been vectorized using gis and statistical tools were used for measuring the distances arcmap 10 3 2 3 sediment collection and analysis in each river sites with all the three mesohabitats rapid pool and benchland were selected a total of 135 sediment samples were collected sediments were taken with the help of scoop peterson s grab and metal quadrate for rapid pool and benchland respectively the sediment for texture analysis were kept at room temperature and those for soil chemistry ph total organic carbon toc total nitrogen tn and total phosphorous tp were kept in the icebox samples for soil moisture content were stored in aluminum containers and each container was kept in a separate zip lock bag in order to avoid desiccation in the laboratory soil ph was measured in 1 1 soil distilled

method and particle size classification was carried out folk 1980 wentworth 1922 2 4 river macroinvertebrates a total of 135 45 rapid 45 pool and 45 benchland macroinvertebrate samples were collected using a surber sampler mesh size 250 µm 900 cm2 peterson s grab 640 cm2 and metal frame quadrant 625 cm2 for rapid pool and benchland respectively a sieve mesh size 250 µm was used for the sample derived from the pool and benchland boulders and pebbles were removed before washing the sediment materials retained on the sieve were preserved in 90 ethanol in the laboratory all the samples were washed to remove excess soil sorted under a magnifying lens and preserved in fresh 90 ethanol all sorted samples were identified to the lowest taxonomic level genus family by using literature epler

faunal record or dominance of single species were not considered occurrence of dominant species were represented using percentage composition from three mesohabitats rpbs univariate analysis was carried out on the mbi abundance using d i v e r s i t y function from the package vegan oksanen et al 2020 the total abundance n and total number of taxa s in each sample were calculated the shannon wiener index h was calculated to compare the species diversity across varied mesohabitats rpbs along streams whereas to check how evenly mbi species is distributed along different habitat pielou s evenness j was calculated later the distribution of the environmental variables and biological indices were visualized using box and whisker plot from the ggpubr package kassambara 2020 to further test differences in environmental and mbi diversity indices the non parametric kruskal wallis statistical test was performed in addition mann whitney u tests was used for pairwise comparisons of rpbs kassambara 2021 we fitted a piecewise structural equation p s e m mixed effects generalized linear g l m e r model and linear models l m e model to evaluate the hypothesized pathways while observing how mesohabitat rpbs and the environment influence the abundance and total number of taxa of river mbi fig 3 as most of the diversity indices were derived from the abundance and total number of taxa

removing variables with strong correlation r 0 7 from available soil classes pca 1 axis for texture was obtained and used for further analysis we also applied data transformations to meet the assumptions of normality and homogeneity of variances o brien 2007 to study the overall system the mesohabitat was set as an exogenous variable whereby to see behavior and habitat functioning we built habitat specific p s e m the other parameters based on their general nature and prior knowledge of the variables were considered as response and predictors we also checked the multicollinearity in each component model by calculating the variance inflation factor vif for each predictor vif 3 indicates possible collinearity and the variables were removed further reduction in the number of variables and model comparison was done by using akaike information criteria corrected aicc for small sample size table 1 the directed separation d s e p test was conducted on the fitted models for any significant missing paths and based on akaike information criterion aic with the lowest values the claimed path was selected shipley 2013 these recognized missing claims were added to optimize the

indices followed the same pattern to that of total number of taxa in statistical comparison test p 0 05 during our study the rapid habitat was dominated taxa 10 table s2 by hydropsychae spp baetis spp and cricotopus trifsciatus which represent the order trichoptera ephemeroptera and diptera respectively whereas the pool habitat showed highest composition taxa 10 of taxa from the order diptera such as chironomus spp and polypedilum spp in the benchland mesohabitat the taxa from the order tubificida tubifex sp diptera tipulidae and gastropoda lymnaeidae were recorded as the major contributors taxa 10 3 2 causal pathway of mbi structure along rpbs the p s e m with the aggregated data showed that mesohabitat had a significant role in structuring the mbi communities fig 6 however habitat specific models showed how mbi abundance and total number of taxa were affected via different pathways in rpbs in the overall model where habitat is exogenous variable texture tp and ph were the most important variable affecting the abundance marginal r2 0 61 conditional r2 0 61 fig 6a and total number of taxa marginal r2 0 25 conditional r2 0 38 fig 6a additionally the large difference in habitat marginal means was observed for mbi abundance a b c fig 6a and table s4 while for total number of taxa marginal mean differences show a distinction between the rapid and benchland the direct positive effect of tp on abundance and negative of soil ph on total number of taxa was observed in the overall p s e m fig 6a and table s3 the p s e m for rapid showed the direct negative effect of system width for both total number of taxa and abundance but soil moisture negatively affected only the total number of taxa fig 6b and table s5 there was no significant effect of tn and tp on total number of taxa and abundance in the rapid mesohabitat fig 6b in the pool p s e m total number of taxa and abundance were significantly affected by soil texture and tn respectively fig 6c and table s6 benchland p s e m followed different pathways wherein abundance is directly affected by tn tp and ph though total number of taxa is affected by tp soil moisture and ph the soil texture effect on total number of taxa and abundance was seen via moisture and ph in the benchland habitat fig 6d and table s7 4 discussion in this study we examined the effect of river physical characteristics and soil environment parameters on the mbi abundance and total number of taxa along repeated rpbs mesohabitat of five river ecosystems in the shaanxi province of northwest china the rapid and pool support different mbi communities while benchland can accommodate fauna from both these mesohabitats we have also explored the connection between mesohabitat environment and physical characters which shows that in higher elevated mesohabitats if rivers or streams have smaller channel widths then soil tn can promote the mbi abundances on the other hand higher mbi taxa were favored by soil with less water holding capacity in rivers the physical characteristics of the river and sediment texture are inextricably linked belletti et al 2017 in the present study river mesohabitat length and width river width and altitude were considered as the major physical characteristics the rapid system showed variation in length due to the slope of the riverbed and flow velocity the differentiation in the river width and elevation in benchland could be due to the irregular shape and structure of the system fryirs et al 2018 wheaton et al 2015 compared to the other mesohabiats the pool had a higher quantity of fine particle sediments and even sludge due to the slow water flow relatively rich plants and deeper water bodies wang et al 2017 the variation in sediment particles observed in the present mesohabitats corroborates findings from other riverine systems anonymous 2014b 2014a consistent with sediment texture tn and tp were highest in the pool followed by the bench and rapid indicating that slow movement of water rich vegetation coupled with relatively homogenous sediment allow the accumulation of nutrients in the pools wang et al 2017 on the other hand benchland with transitional phases between partially exposed and exposed sediment helps to degrade the accumulated pollutant and nutrients chen et al 2015 however at some rapid and pool tn and tp values were similar because both these mesohabitats are characterized by fine sediments which promote the production or accumulation of these nutrients in the system bonada et al 2020 lin et al 2021 some of the extreme values of tp and tn in the present mesohabitats may be due to the small headwater streams which are easily susceptible to human impacts dalu and wasserman 2018 kristensen and globevnik 2014 weigelhofer 2017 from the metamodel marginal means rapid and pool vary in the mbi abundance and total number of taxa however benchland showed similarities in marginal means with the other two mesohabitats pool and rapid indicating that habitat heterogenity accounts for the mbi community dynamics in general mbi abundance diversity and evenness were higher in the pool followed by rapid and benchland however mbi total number of taxa was higher in rapid followed by pool and bench in general the mbi in the benchland meoshabitat had low mbi communities in the river environment habitat structure and environmental variables have a significant influence on the river mbi abundance and number of taxa as seen in the overall psem the factors for the variation in the mbi abundance and total number of taxa were ph soil texture and tp indicating that these parameters play a key role in the spatial variation of mbi distribution along the mesoahabitats of the studied river system further among the environmental variables the metamodel identified finer soil particles can lower the soil ph which can support mbi total number of taxa while tp production positively influences the mbi abundance this lower soil ph condition in the river may be due to the sampling time as rivers undergo episodic lower ph levels especially in the springtime feeley et al 2013 feeley and kelly quinn 2014 moreover stream with peaty soil can also lower the ph during the same season mc conigley et al 2017 besides low ph which may have caused the production of tp in fine soil there are other variables that may be responsible for controlling the nutrient formation in the soil such as soil moisture during the field study we recorded pool and benchland possess larger areas as compared to rapid and had soft substrata which have the capacity to hold moisture that allows the formation of tp in the soil soil moisture is also responsible for the degradation of the leaf litter in the soil thus enhancing the organic content and other biogeochemical cycles lack of soil moisture can definitely impact the soil microbial fauna and hence the biogeochemical activity merritt and lawson 1992 as represented in our psem higher production of tn in pool mesohabitat can affect the mbi community positively it is likely that microbial conditioning occurs more rapidly in stream habitat due to optimal moisture and uniform stream temperature however a reverse trend has been observed in the rapid mesohabitat where despite the smaller width size and less water holding capacity substrata promote the growth of the mbi communities in the river mostly at the hyporheic zone positive interaction between sediment texture and moisture for microbial respiration and activity as well as the physical protection of om promotes a suitable conditions for heterotrophic viability moyano et al 2013 the pool has been identified as a highly active zone for microbial activities than the rapid and benchland system wang et al 2019 on the contrary available finer soil can retain moisture for a longer time in the benchland the benchlands can also under go wet and dry conditions because of their positioning in the riverine system furthermore exposure to the environmental condition and available finer soil particles along with lower soil moisture can increase the ph consequently increasing the tn production in the soil which ultimately helps the tp production in the benchland chen et al 2015 mbi distribution was also related to abiotic features along the landscape abiotic variables related to topography such as sediment size appeared to be more important than physico chemical variables to define river types and predict invertebrate composition pero et al 2020 in rivers stones and similar physical objects provide food for the animals by trapping particulate organic matter hawkins 1984 stewart et al 2003 while habitats with fine material and decaying vegetation can also support the high abundance and diversity of mbi kamboj et al 2020 in the present study even though rapid and pool mesohabitat provide majority of the shelter for invertebrates such as collector gatherers trichoptera and diptera and scrapers ephemeroptera the dominance of tubificida taxon were found in the benchland this is because the trapped leaf litter and organic matter can attract varieties of mbi in the rapid and pool habitat baptista et al 2001 additionally the invertebrate abundance increases with the proportion of fine sediment and soil moisture component churchwell et al 2016 which corroborates our findings pool habitat the similarities of pool taxa in benchland may occur due to the many floodplain species having adaptations to survive in the moist areas oligochaeta gastropoda diplopoda isopoda diptera and coleoptera with higher diversity and abundance especially diptera merritt and lawson 1992 the variation in the physico chemical parameters mostly occurred because of the system morphology and soil texture composition which vary for all the three mesohabitats rpbs in the pool habitat the system width and river width varies along with silt and clay composition of the soil which ultimately supports a wide variation in the tp tn and soil moisture values whereas in the bench system variation of ph and toc can be due to the exposure and higher variation of sediment type coarse sand fine and very fine sand past studies of the wei river basin showed that tn and agricultural land can affect the mbi assemblages in particularly the species richness and diversity indices suggesting mbi could be indicators of nutrition status in the wei river basin liu et al 2020 similarly using these nutrients on mesohabitat level can help us to understand the functioning of the ecosystem in detail 5 future work in rpbs direction the ecological study on riverine mesohabitat has been neglected due to its heterogeneous substrata and infrequent occurrence along the river as mesohabitat influences the mbi total number of taxa and abundances as shown in the present study identification and studying of heterogeneous habitats can reveal the structural and functional pattern of mbi community therefore studying such mesohabitat in the riverine system can improve the understanding of mbi in this system thus we propose the following research directions to improve the understanding of the riverine system 1 further study with taxonomic resolution can answer species specific supports for different mesohabitat 2 research considering their functional traits can help to understand the system specific role in the river environment 3 seasonal comparative studies of these rpbs can further help to understand about the behaviors of these mesohabitats and their influence on the mbi 6 conclusion to our knowledge this is the first study to report the relationship between river physico chemical and mbi diversity indices from the rpbs along the river if we are to predict the future impacts of disturbance in the riverine system we need to have a better mechanistic understanding of the various mesohabitats of this system using various approaches including models experiments and in situ data across multiple spatial and temporal scales the rpbs is one of the least studied habitats in the riverine system in this article along with multihabitat sampling the p s e m approach was used to study the environmental variables shaping the mbi community in the rpbs our results indicate that the rpbs has a significant effect on the mbi community in the present studied locations substrata was the most critical factor for the heterogeneity of the mbi community in the rpbs the mbi community heterogeneity may affect the other variables in the stream in turn influencing the various ecological process such as the biogeochemical process further although benchland has been the most neglected riverine habitat the present study demonstrated that benchland can also be an important habitat supporting a heterogeneous mbi community overall these mesohabitat presented relatively distinct macroinvertebrate community structures therefore the present study reveals that mesohabitats can also increase the biodiversity and improve the biological productivity of the river furthermore including the rpbs mesohabitat in bioassesment and ecological surveys can help to understand role of mesohabitat in shaping mbi assemblages however the role of different environmental conditions between mesohabitats in determining macroinvertebrate response still needs further investigation nevertheless our results improve the understanding of the mbi community and factors that affect them and such studies are particularly relevant given the current threats to the rivers

928,spatial heterogeneity causes the natural variability of the physical factors which are critical to the functioning of the riverine ecosystem repeatedly occurring heterogeneous mesohabitats in the rapid pool benchland system rpbs are universally seen along natural rivers the heterogeneity of the mesohabitat mosaic is a key factor determining the macrobenthic invertebrate mbi communities of the river ecosystem mbi communities serve multiple functions of river ecosystems however limited studies have been done on the effect heterogeneous mesohabitats of rpbs on abundance and distribution pattern of mbi communities in this paper we examined abundance and distribution patterns of mbi communities in the rpbs mesohabitats along five rivers of the shaanxi province in the northwest china a total of 112 mesohabitats comprising 40 rapids 37 pools and 35 benchlands were sampled the mbi environmental relationships were analyzed using the piecewise structural equation model p s e m at two

rivers streams lakes ponds wetlands as well as groundwater reid et al 2020 they play a fundamental ecological role and provide economically important products and services covich et al 2004 postel and carpenter 1997 in addition they provide critical habitats for a large variety of aquatic plants fishes reptiles birds and mammals nyingi et al 2013 however river ecosystems are influenced by changes at different spatial and temporal scales investigating these complex natural interactions provides context and guidance for simulating the impact of changes in the river ecosystem kiesel et al 2019 in nature river functioning is a complex organized system characterized by river flow sedimentation distribution of organic matter om organisms humans climate change and economic activity consequently ensuing habitat heterogeneity kovalchuk et al 2020 environmental heterogeneity in a river is formed by geomorphological units river basin vegetation sediment distribution and hydrological connectivity which plays an important role in the biodiversity and functioning of the river system palmer et al 2010 such heterogeneity forms natural mesohabitats visually distinct areas of habitat identifiable from banks to streams to river beds to vegetation along the river armitage et al 1995 armitage and pardo 1995 in river environment high biodiversity is commonly associated with mesohabitat silva et al 2014 and hence mesohabitat is an ecologically important structural unit to understand the river system pardo and armitage 1997 the repeated naturally occurring mesohabitats are a combination of regular structures i e the rapid pool benchland system rpbs in the natural or semi natural rivers wang et al 2019 chen et al 2015 2014b 2014a the pool is a deeper habitat that is generally close to the bank while the benchland is formed by settling of sediment and other materials delivered by the river action and the rapid is generally seen in the middle line of the stream wang et al 2019 2014b 2014a these rpbs occur due to the geo physio dynamical variabilities and are also very important features for sustaining biological diversity especially in terms of beta diversity silva et al 2014 the macrobenthic invertebrate mbi communities are ubiquitous and abundant in most of the river ecosystem lópez lópez and sedeño díaz 2015 the mbi communities also play a critical role in the food chain by participating in the natural flow of energy and nutrients hauer and resh 2017 vannote et al 1980 wallace and webster 1996 in the last few decades mbi have been the most commonly used biological indicator selvanayagam and abril 2016 to assess the ecological status of the aquatic system as they have limited movement a relatively long life cycle mathuriau et al 2012 and a wide range of tolerance to environmental stressors lópez lópez and sedeño díaz 2015 the distribution and abundance of mbi often respond to the interaction of multiple environmental variables including discharge channel width river bed sediment size and anthropogenic activities consequently changing the taxonomic and functional diversity of local communities in addition mbi abundance and richness e g family richness have been widely used to detect environmental responses e g ferreira et al 2014 friberg et al 2011 rasifudi et al 2018 most riverine ecosystem studies focus on the changes in species and their functional relationships in various flow regimes biles et al 2003 cardinale et al 2002 comprehensive studies have been carried out on the mbi community structure and diversity pattern from riffles and pools system these include the effect of fine accumulated sediment harrison et al 2007 structure and functional organization of hyporheic communities jones and lim 2005 multi substratum sampling approach beauger and lair 2008 influence of visually assessment of mesohabitat silva et al 2014 and taxonomic trait structure herbst et al 2018 species and functional patterns of mbi in various flow regimes using multihabitat approach are also well documented fornaroli et al 2016 kemp et al 2000 however the abundance and distribution pattern of mbi and how the morphology and environmental variables influence it are poorly investigated in the rpbs further comparative studies on mbi in different mesohabitats are practically unknown from the warm temperate zone rivers to the best of our knowledge yet elucidating these patterns and biota environmental interactions is critical for management as anthropogenic and climate change impacts on ecosystems intensify it is recognized that studying riverine system with different habitat heterogeneity may be useful in determining the drivers of mbi community structure and function despite the high complexity of rpbs the differences in the mbi communities and the factors that govern the observed pattern have been scarcely explored the avoidance to study mesohabitat in the river by most freshwater benthic ecological researchers is due to the preference of the stable substrata rapid over unstable harrison et al 2007 the warm temperate zone river systems of china are extremely intricate and multifaceted systems however in recent years with population growth the expansion of industrial and agricultural activities and global climate change several ecological disturbances have been reported in many of the river systems of china han et al 2018 li et al 2020 liu et al 2021 wang et al 2019 xia et al 2020 despite the surge of interest in the warm temperate zone river system of china 27 192 searched articles web of science database there are relatively few studies 57 published literature on the mbi community structure and environmental relationship in different mesohabitat the studies in the rpbs river mesohabitat in china focused on microbial abundance and enzymatic activities wang et al 2019 and the effect of mesohabitat on river water quality chen et al 2015 disentangling the complex relationships between different aspects of river environments such as the morphological chemical and anthropogenic drivers and their influence on the biological components is critical for understanding the direct and indirect effects of natural and human driven changes in the ecosystem structural equation modeling sem has been frequently used to explore the mechanism of how independent variables environmental or anthropogenic disturbances can affect the response variable biological when mediated through a third set of variables additionally the structural equation model has been used to discover the link between the effect of land use on climate change and on stream macroinvertebrate li et al 2018 biodiversity pattern and understanding the river functioning by means of macroinvertebrate functional diversity liu et al 2021 although the environmental influences on the river ecosystem are widely recognized river biodiversity and ecology assessment flood management and climate change studies have not assessed and compared these interrelated impacts on the mbi of rpbs therefore in this study we focus on the rpbs from the five warm temperate zone rivers in the shaanxi province of northwest china the objectives of the present study are i to identify the factors influencing the mbi abundance and total number of taxa in the rpbs meoshabitats and ii to compare the total system and individual mesohabitat rpbs for mbi distribution we used the piecewise structural equation model to interpret the mechanisms driving this relationship 2 methodology 2 1 study area the study was conducted in the wei river basin 33o 59 35o 58 n and 106o 41 109o 32 e basin covers about 124 130 km2 fig 1 from shaanxi province of northwest china which falls under the warm temperate zone here the word temperate represents the areas with mild temperatures and this warm temperate zone is located in patches of western south central and eastern china due to its location in the arid and semi arid area of the northwest china the climate type is mainly continental monsoon and other seasons include cold and dry winter hot and rainy summer mild climate in spring and autumn the origin of the wei river is in the north of niaoshu mountain in gansu province which converges into the yellow river in xi an five rivers entailing feng chan ba wei and jing during the spring of 2019 april to july were selected for the present study the jing from the north feng chan and ba from the south form the wei river basin which is supported by the qinling mountain range in the north a total of 45 sites were identified based on the presence of rapid pool and benchland mesohabitats fig 2 at each site 2 2 river physical features the site positions were recorded with the help of gps horiba u 50 the major river physical features for the present study are river width rpbs length and width measurements fig s1 in the supplementary materials prior to the field sampling all the five rivers have been visited for identifying the rpbs availability in the system the rapid mesohabitat length measurements were considered from the beginning of the fast flowing water fp311 flow probe global water till where it dissipates the shallow water area with the high water velocity was marked for the measurements of rapid width the stream pool was firstly physically located later initial point of the slow water movement and rise in depth was considered as the starting point to measure the pool length while the end point was taken just before the beginning of riffle or runs each pool side which was parallel to the river bank with maximum area and depth was referenced for width measurements finally the biggest landmass closest to the river wet areas of the river bank or sandbars was considered for the sampling of the environmental biological and physical features during all the measurements there was always one person standing on the highest point of the bank side to guide and verify the shape of the systems the smaller systems were manually measured length and width in the larger mesohabitats where the manual measurements were not possible the reference points were taken by gps at each mesohabitat minimum 6 reference points were collected later all the measured distances were combined in the google earth system google earth pro 7 3 3 7786 each physical feature had been vectorized using gis and statistical tools were used for measuring the distances arcmap 10 3 2 3 sediment collection and analysis in each river sites with all the three mesohabitats rapid pool and benchland were selected a total of 135 sediment samples were collected sediments were taken with the help of scoop peterson s grab and metal quadrate for rapid pool and benchland respectively the sediment for texture analysis were kept at room temperature and those for soil chemistry ph total organic carbon toc total nitrogen tn and total phosphorous tp were kept in the icebox samples for soil moisture content were stored in aluminum containers and each container was kept in a separate zip lock bag in order to avoid desiccation in the laboratory soil ph was measured in 1 1 soil distilled water w v mclean 1983 toc was determined through wet combustion titrimetric method nelson and sommers 1983 tp was measured using the molybdenum blue colorimetric method hj 632 2011 2011 and tn was estimated by the kjeldahl method hj 717 2014 2014 for soil moisture analysis containers were immediately measured gardner 1986 pre dried soil was used for sediment texture analysis using the sieve method and particle size classification was carried out folk 1980 wentworth 1922 2 4 river macroinvertebrates a total of 135 45 rapid 45 pool and 45 benchland macroinvertebrate samples were collected using a surber sampler mesh size 250 µm 900 cm2 peterson s grab 640 cm2 and metal frame quadrant 625 cm2 for rapid pool and benchland respectively a sieve mesh size 250 µm was used for the sample derived from the pool and benchland boulders and pebbles were removed before washing the sediment materials retained on the sieve were preserved in 90 ethanol in the laboratory all the samples were washed to remove excess soil sorted under a magnifying lens and preserved in fresh 90 ethanol all sorted samples were identified to the lowest taxonomic level genus family by using literature epler 2001 gooderham and tsyrlin 2002 kriska 2013 thorp and rogers 2015 william 1967 2 5 data analysis the final analysis was carried out on 112 samples 40 rapids 37 pools and 35 benchland samples with no faunal record or dominance of single species were not considered occurrence of dominant species were represented using percentage composition from three mesohabitats rpbs univariate analysis was carried out on the mbi abundance using d i v e r s i t y function from the package vegan oksanen et al 2020 the total abundance n and total number of taxa s in each sample were calculated the shannon wiener index h was calculated to compare the species diversity across varied mesohabitats rpbs along streams whereas to check how evenly mbi species is distributed along different habitat pielou s evenness j was calculated later the distribution of the environmental variables and biological indices were visualized using box and whisker plot from the ggpubr package kassambara 2020 to further test differences in environmental and mbi diversity indices the non parametric kruskal wallis statistical test was performed in addition mann whitney u tests was used for pairwise comparisons of rpbs kassambara 2021 we fitted a piecewise structural equation p s e m mixed effects generalized linear g l m e r model and linear models l m e model to evaluate the hypothesized pathways while observing how mesohabitat rpbs and the environment influence the abundance and total number of taxa of river mbi fig 3 as most of the diversity indices were derived from the abundance and total number of taxa these two indices can be good representative for understanding the distribution of the mbi along rpbs in this model habitat was selected as the fixed effect and river was the random effect sem tool is extensively used for understanding the complex structure of nature lefcheck et al 2016 here p s e m is permitted to list the structured equations which are identified by linear l m e and generalized linear model g l m e r functions as well as p s e m function in r library piecewisesem lefcheck 2016 allows to fit non normally distributed models reduction in physico chemical variables was done by removing variables with strong correlation r 0 7 from available soil classes pca 1 axis for texture was obtained and used for further analysis we also applied data transformations to meet the assumptions of normality and homogeneity of variances o brien 2007 to study the overall system the mesohabitat was set as an exogenous variable whereby to see behavior and habitat functioning we built habitat specific p s e m the other parameters based on their general nature and prior knowledge of the variables were considered as response and predictors we also checked the multicollinearity in each component model by calculating the variance inflation factor vif for each predictor vif 3 indicates possible collinearity and the variables were removed further reduction in the number of variables and model comparison was done by using akaike information criteria corrected aicc for small sample size table 1 the directed separation d s e p test was conducted on the fitted models for any significant missing paths and based on akaike information criterion aic with the lowest values the claimed path was selected shipley 2013 these recognized missing claims were added to optimize the model once the model was updated the evaluation was carried out using global goodness of fit indices fisher s c statistics p 0 05 whereas for categorical variables rather than a model derived coefficient effect the marginal means were used these marginal means along with groups were derived through e m m e a n s function in r lenth 2021 finally the summary marginal r2 and conditional r2 have been extracted for the response variables all statistical analyses were performed by using program r r core team 2020 3 results 3 1 mesohabitat characterization the range values of the

marginal means was observed for mbi abundance a b c fig 6a and table s4 while for total number of taxa marginal mean differences show a distinction between the rapid and benchland the direct positive effect of tp on abundance and negative of soil ph on total number of taxa was observed in the overall p s e m fig 6a and table s3 the p s e m for rapid showed the direct negative effect of system width for both total number of taxa and abundance but soil moisture negatively affected only the total number of taxa fig 6b and table s5 there was no significant effect of tn and tp on total number of taxa and abundance in the rapid mesohabitat fig 6b in the pool p s e m total number of taxa and abundance were significantly affected by soil texture and tn respectively fig 6c and table s6 benchland p s e m followed different pathways wherein abundance is directly affected by tn tp and ph though total number of taxa is affected by tp soil moisture and ph the soil texture effect on total number of taxa and abundance was seen via moisture and ph in the benchland habitat fig 6d and table s7 4 discussion in this study we examined the effect of river physical characteristics and soil environment parameters on the mbi abundance and total number of taxa along repeated rpbs mesohabitat of five river ecosystems in the shaanxi province of northwest china the rapid and pool support different mbi communities while benchland can accommodate fauna from both these mesohabitats we have also explored the connection between mesohabitat environment and physical characters which shows that in higher elevated mesohabitats if rivers or streams have smaller channel widths then soil tn can promote the mbi abundances on the other hand higher mbi taxa were favored by soil with less water holding capacity in rivers the physical characteristics of the river and sediment texture are inextricably linked belletti et al 2017 in the present study river mesohabitat length and width river width and altitude were considered as the major physical characteristics the rapid system showed variation in length due to the slope of the riverbed and flow velocity the differentiation in the river width and elevation in benchland could be due to the irregular shape and structure of the system fryirs et al 2018 wheaton et al 2015 compared to the other mesohabiats the pool had a higher quantity of fine particle sediments and even sludge due to the slow water flow relatively rich plants and deeper water bodies wang et al 2017 the variation in sediment particles observed in the present mesohabitats corroborates findings from other riverine systems anonymous 2014b 2014a consistent with sediment texture tn and tp were highest in the pool followed by the bench and rapid indicating that slow movement of water rich vegetation coupled with relatively homogenous sediment allow the accumulation of nutrients in the pools wang et al 2017 on the other hand benchland with transitional phases between partially exposed and exposed sediment helps to degrade the accumulated pollutant and nutrients chen et al 2015 however at some rapid and pool tn and tp values were similar because both these mesohabitats are characterized by fine sediments which promote the production or accumulation of these nutrients in the system bonada et al 2020 lin et al 2021 some of the extreme values of tp and tn in the present mesohabitats may be due to the small headwater streams which are easily susceptible to human impacts dalu and wasserman 2018 kristensen and globevnik 2014 weigelhofer 2017 from the metamodel marginal means rapid and pool vary in the mbi abundance and total number of taxa however benchland showed similarities in marginal means with the other two mesohabitats pool and rapid indicating that habitat heterogenity accounts for the mbi community dynamics in general mbi abundance diversity and evenness were higher in the pool followed by rapid and benchland however mbi total number of taxa was higher in rapid followed by pool and bench in general the mbi in the benchland meoshabitat had low mbi communities in the river environment habitat structure and environmental variables have a significant influence on the river mbi abundance and number of taxa as seen in the overall psem the factors for the variation in the mbi abundance and total number of taxa were ph soil texture and tp indicating that these parameters play a key role in the spatial variation of mbi distribution along the mesoahabitats of the studied river system further among the environmental variables the metamodel identified finer soil particles can lower the soil ph which can support mbi total number of taxa while tp production positively influences the mbi abundance this lower soil ph condition in the river may be due to the sampling time as rivers undergo episodic lower ph levels especially in the springtime feeley et al 2013 feeley and kelly quinn 2014 moreover stream with peaty soil can also lower the ph during the same season mc conigley et al 2017 besides low ph which may have caused the production of tp in fine soil there are other variables that may be responsible for controlling the nutrient formation in the soil such as soil moisture during the field study we recorded pool and benchland possess larger areas as compared to rapid and had soft substrata which have the capacity to hold moisture that allows the formation of tp in the soil soil moisture is also responsible for the degradation of the leaf litter in the soil thus enhancing the organic content and other biogeochemical cycles lack of soil moisture can definitely impact the soil microbial fauna and hence the biogeochemical activity merritt and lawson 1992 as represented in our psem higher production of tn in pool mesohabitat can affect the mbi community positively it is likely that microbial conditioning occurs more rapidly in stream habitat due to optimal moisture and uniform stream temperature however a reverse trend has been observed in the rapid mesohabitat where despite the smaller width size and less water holding capacity substrata promote the growth of the mbi communities in the river mostly at the hyporheic zone positive interaction between sediment texture and moisture for microbial respiration and activity as well as the physical protection of om promotes a suitable conditions for heterotrophic viability moyano et al 2013 the pool has been identified as a highly active zone for microbial activities than the rapid and benchland system wang et al 2019 on the contrary available finer soil can retain moisture for a longer time in the benchland the benchlands can also under go wet and dry conditions because of their positioning in the riverine system furthermore exposure to the environmental condition and available finer soil particles along with lower soil moisture can increase the ph consequently increasing the tn production in the soil which ultimately helps the tp production in the benchland chen et al 2015 mbi distribution was also related to abiotic features along the landscape abiotic variables related to topography such as sediment size appeared to be more important than physico chemical variables to define river types and predict invertebrate composition pero et al 2020 in rivers stones and similar physical objects provide food for the animals by trapping particulate organic matter hawkins 1984 stewart et al 2003 while habitats with fine material and decaying vegetation can also support the high abundance and diversity of mbi kamboj et al 2020 in the present study even though rapid and pool mesohabitat provide majority of the shelter for invertebrates such as collector gatherers trichoptera and diptera and scrapers ephemeroptera the dominance of tubificida taxon were found in the benchland this is because the trapped leaf litter and organic matter can attract varieties of mbi in the rapid and pool habitat baptista et al 2001 additionally the invertebrate abundance increases with the proportion of fine sediment and soil moisture component churchwell et al 2016 which corroborates our findings pool habitat the similarities of pool taxa in benchland may occur due to the many floodplain species having adaptations to survive in the moist areas oligochaeta gastropoda diplopoda isopoda diptera and coleoptera with higher diversity and abundance especially diptera merritt and lawson 1992 the variation in the physico chemical parameters mostly occurred because of the system morphology and soil texture composition which vary for all the three mesohabitats rpbs in the pool habitat the system width and river width varies along with silt and clay composition of the soil which ultimately supports a wide variation in the tp tn and soil moisture values whereas in the bench system variation of ph and toc can be due to the exposure and higher variation of sediment type coarse sand fine and very fine sand past studies of the wei river basin showed that tn and agricultural land can affect the mbi assemblages in particularly the species richness and diversity indices suggesting mbi could be indicators of nutrition status in the wei river basin liu et al 2020 similarly using these nutrients on mesohabitat level can help us to understand the functioning of the ecosystem in detail 5 future work in rpbs direction the ecological study on riverine mesohabitat has been neglected due to its heterogeneous substrata and infrequent occurrence along the river as mesohabitat influences the mbi total number of taxa and abundances as shown in the present study identification and studying of heterogeneous habitats can reveal the structural and functional pattern of mbi community therefore studying such mesohabitat in the riverine system can improve the understanding of mbi in this system thus we propose the following research directions to improve the understanding of the riverine system 1 further study with taxonomic resolution can answer species specific supports for different mesohabitat 2 research considering their functional traits can help to understand the system specific role in the river environment 3 seasonal comparative studies of these rpbs can further help to understand about the behaviors of these mesohabitats and their influence on the mbi 6 conclusion to our knowledge this is the first study to report the relationship between river physico chemical and mbi diversity indices from the rpbs along the river if we are to predict the future impacts of disturbance in the riverine system we need to have a better mechanistic understanding of the various mesohabitats of this system using various approaches including models experiments and in situ data across multiple spatial and temporal scales the rpbs is one of the least studied habitats in the riverine system in this article along with multihabitat sampling the p s e m approach was used to study the environmental variables shaping the mbi community in the rpbs our results indicate that the rpbs has a significant effect on the mbi community in the present studied locations substrata was the most critical factor for the heterogeneity of the mbi community in the rpbs the mbi community heterogeneity may affect the other variables in the stream in turn influencing the various ecological process such as the biogeochemical process further although benchland has been the most neglected riverine habitat the present study demonstrated that benchland can also be an important habitat supporting a heterogeneous mbi community overall these mesohabitat presented relatively distinct macroinvertebrate community structures therefore the present study reveals that mesohabitats can also increase the biodiversity and improve the biological productivity of the river furthermore including the rpbs mesohabitat in bioassesment and ecological surveys can help to understand role of mesohabitat in shaping mbi assemblages however the role of different environmental conditions between mesohabitats in determining macroinvertebrate response still needs further investigation nevertheless our results improve the understanding of the mbi community and factors that affect them and such studies are particularly relevant given the current threats to the rivers

929,river channel deflectors are environmentally friendly low head hydraulic structures constructed from wood stones and coarse gravel their aim is to protect river banks against erosion to change the direction of river flow making the river course naturally meandrous instead of artificially straight to provide natural refugia for fish and invertebrates and finally to improve hydraulic discharge conditions however from the designing point of view they are difficult to represent in hydrodynamic models since they are constructed and fixed in the river bed differently for this reason in hydraulic models deflectors may be treated as modifications to the value of the watercourse bed roughness or reduction in the active part of the cross section thus to test the suitability of one dimensional models for river restoration involving river deflectors a 1 d numerical model of the lower section of the flinta river wielkopolska province poland was prepared to do that firstly three channel flow deflectors were constructed and installed in the lower section of the flinta river secondly hydrometric measurements were continued systematically over three years next based on field studies and field data calculations were made using the hec ras 1 d software several variants of the shape and the effect of deflectors were tested on this basis the variability of the roughness coefficient value for the flinta riverbed after the implementation of deflectors was analyzed the novelty of the research is that the obtained results show that river channel deflectors have a significant influence on the processes of morphological changes such as velocity distribution grain size changes tendency towards channel meandering channel slope of the riverbed and thus also on changes in hydromorphological parameters of river flow the presented case study confirmed the potential for effective deflector operation for the velocity range of 0 10 0 30 m s 1 the maximum changes of the river bed elevation after the deflectors had been introduced reached 0 10 m it was also found that the effect of deflectors on roughness at high water levels was non significant and did not increase the risk of flooding for q1 flow the implementation of flow deflectors had no significant effect on the capacity of the studied river section only slight subduction of 0 02 0 03 m of the water surface in the vicinity of the deflectors could be observed compared to the model from before the restoration activities the greatest impact of the channel deflectors is seen at low water levels and low flows that do not exceed average flow values finally it was shown that the best solution to implement deflectors into a one dimensional model is to consider their influence as a change in the value of manning s coefficient the obtained results can be considered universal in relation to typical transformed small lowland watercourses that have been straightened and regulated and are to be subjectedto the process of river restoration keywords roughness coefficient river channel deflector the flinta river 1 d hec ras model hydromorphology river restoration 1 introduction the destruction of valuable water and water dependent habitats as well as the loss of their eco systemic impact has led in many cases to an increased awareness of the importance of these habitats yi et al 2014 radecki pawlik 2015 this became the basis for more conscious management of environmental resources and the spread of knowledge concerning the importance of this problem rana et al 2017 roni and beechie 2012 as a result large scale efforts have begun to be made not only concerning the maintenance and protection of current river conditions but also river restoration and revitalization dufour and piegay 2009 elkins et al 2007 this is also reflected in the provisions of national law polish water law 2017 as well as international documents e g the water framework directive the water framework directive wfd or 2000 60 ec directive of the european parliament and the council of 23 october 2000 water framework directive establishing a framework for community action in the field of water policy is in force throughout the european union and obliges all the member states to protect watercourses and water reservoirs the directive imposes the obligation to make all possible attempts to improve the condition of watercourses and water reservoirs to ensure at least their good condition these regulations together with other eu regulations support the restoration of watercourses roni and beechie 2012 dufour and piegay 2009 pan et al 2016 kałuża et al 2014 river restoration is the process of transformation and actions that aims to restore waters and bring them closer to their natural state ser 20017 tyminski and kałuża 2013 river restoration is a difficult activity and it is very often impossible to carry out roni and beechie 2012 hammersmark et al 2010 obtaining an ecosystem that is resilient and sustainable through such activities is not always obvious and realistic a method that can significantly support the process of planning and selecting appropriate measures to improve the ecological status of the river can be the properly conducted using hydrodynamic modelling cao et al 2011 tyminski 2012 radecki pawlik 2014 hydraulic models can provide information on flows depths and changes in elevation laks et al 2017 guo and zhang 2016 walczak et al 2018 all these elements affect the biological and hydromorphological parameters of rivers that are being restored radecki pawlik 2014 szałkiewicz et al 2019 this applies in particular to changes in the value of the channel roughness coefficient after the implemented revitalization measures for the section in which a set of flow deflectors was installed szałkiewicz et al 2019 thompson and stull 2002 niezgoda and johnson 2006 in the above context river restoration requires a comprehensive approach including engineering tasks e g methods for the prediction of hydraulic hydromorphological and ecological restoration outcomes bockelmann et al 2004 such opportunities are provided by hydraulic and eco hydraulic modeling yi et al 2014 rana et al 2017 elkins et al 2007 laks et al 2017 guo and zhang 2016 miwa and parker 2012 gibson and pasternack 2016 greene et al 2013 matisziw et al 2015 papanicolaou et al 2011 models can be used in two ways first those may approximate past and forecast conditions in the riverbed and at the floodplains which may give an overall picture of the whole system secondly more specific changes caused by restoration measures and techniques may be assessed before implementation pagliara and kurdistani 2016 palmer at al 2005 river channel flow deflectors are a type of hydraulic structures made of stone gabions wood or fascine lenar et al 2009 kałuża et al 2018 they are incorporated into the river at every 5 7 channel widths which is connected with the riffle pool sequence distance in rivers radecki pawlik 2014 they direct flows and are often implemented to create a ramp for fish rana et al 2017 lenar matyas et al 2009 expressed an opinion that deflectors increase bed roughness of mountain and lowland rivers and when properly positioned they force the direction of the flow aerate the stream and contribute to the self purification of the watercourse they are applied not only in river engineering but also to protect water banks and shores biron et al 2004 including seashores deflectors used in river revitalization and restoration treatments are described as a series of low structures in the bed that irregularly narrow the bed causing variation in flow velocity reducing local erosion and accumulation pan et al 2016 beckers et al 2015 to avoid uncontrolled riverbank scour erosion and significant flow disturbance deflectors are small and their impact is limited river channel deflectors are used successfully for both mountain and submontane rivers and lowland rivers however this requires different construction techniques and use of materials fig 1 the materials and design of deflectors are determined by the operating conditions of the structure susceptibility to deterioration and availability of local materials zaborowski et al 2021 this study aimed to analyze changes in the values of averaged roughness coefficients for the bed of a lowland river in which a set of channel deflectors was introduced as a means to initiate restoration processes this issue is extremely important in terms of assessing the impact of these treatments on water flow conditions our paper analyzes the variability of the roughness coefficient value for the flinta river bed after the implementation of river restoration structures in the form of river channel deflectors after consultations with the regional water management board in poznan rzgw the authors designed and constructed deflectors in the flinta riverbed this river was selected as a part of the national program for the renaturalization of surface waters in poland pawlaczyk 2020 and a team of researchers from the poznań university of life sciences had already carried out rrenaturalization related research projects on this section of the flinta e g kałuża et al 2018 the research showed that the watercourse has a high ecological potential and the team started to look for opportunities to improve its ecological status by restoring meanders of the flinta on the basis of the performed research the effect of deflectors on flow resistance was determined for low medium and high water flows finally the accuracy of output parameters indicating the impact of river deflectors was tested firstly to solve a problem with the definition of small instream hydraulic structures a set of deflectors was built in the river reach then it was introduced into the 1 d model in various possible variants including modifications of cross sections simulations were performed using the hec ras 5 0 6 software two calculation variants were tested 1 the channel without deflectors and 2 the channel after the structures had been introduced with 4 different methods of entering deflectors into the model the main practical output of our research and simulation show the applicability of 1d models to analyze simple river management low head hydraulic structures in our case fascine low head hydraulics deflectors the obtained results can be considered universal in relation to typical transformed small lowland watercourses that have been straightened and regulated the novelty of the presented research is connected with the reference of the results of field research carried out systematically for almost three years to obtained 1 d model outputs and then to draw specific conclusions 2 description of the researched river section the research facility is located near the village of rożnowo młyn in the rogoźno commune wielkopolska province poland and it is an estuarial fragment of the flinta river which is a right tributary of the wełna river fig 2 based on the water framework directive wfd 2000 the flinta river is classified as a lowland sandy stream the length of the river is 27 km and its catchment area is 345 47 km2 like most watercourses in poland it has been strongly transformed as a result of regulatory and land reclamation activities carried out in both the 19th and 20th centuries szałkiewicz et al 2022a żelazo 2006 żelazo popek 2014 the transformations made in the 19th century were carried out for the needs of agriculture meadows and pastures there is one water gauge station on the flinta located in ryczywół km 14 355 szałkiewicz et al 2022b the length of the river is 27 km and its catchment area is 345 47 km2 one water gauge station on the flinta is located in ryczywół km 14 355 szałkiewicz et al 2022b publicly available hydrological data cover the period since 1951 characteristic flows are shown in table 1 hydrological analyses indicated that at the ryczywół water gauge station flows in the range of 0 1 0 2 m3 s occurred most frequently during the 1951 2014 period 13 6 of all days in the multi year period according to the physiographic division kondracki 1994 the flinta is located in the pojezierze chodzieskie mesoregion the estuary section which is at the same time the longest section of the flinta river flows through the ryczywół commune comprising also valuable natural areas paluch 2009 apart from the noteć forest there are also two natura 2000 zones in in the commune of ryczywół under the habitats directive the chlebowo swamp plh300016 and the wełna valley plh300043 among large scale nature conservation areas in the ryczywół commune there are also protected landscape areas the wełna valley based on research conducted using the river habitat survey rhs method szoszkiewicz et al 2020 the investigated section on the flinta river was classified as significantly modified and was assigned class iv szoszkiewicz et al 2020 raven et al 1998 the average slope of the riverbed is about 0 75 with lower gradients in the upper and middle stretches where the river valley is wide and flat along the downstream part of the river in the length of 11 km the valley becomes narrower and the channel slope increases the studied river reach is nearly 160 m long and is characterized by a drop of the water level of ca 1 3 3 materials and methods 3 1 materials openwork fascine deflectors were selected for the study as eco friendly and easy to build structures of simple design the location of deflectors in the estuarine section of the flinta river was not accidental namely the selected section is where basket studies had already been conducted kałuża et al 2015 kałuża et al 2016 and which due to the shape of the valley the geological structure of the bed fine sands medium sands and gravels and intensive sediment transport is susceptible to transformation wicker deflectors were made according to literature recommendations pagliara and kurdistani 2016 they were designed to obstruct approx 1 3 of the width of the riverbed the deflector spacing was approx 5 times the width of the river the deflectors were constructed from pine dowels with a diameter of approx 0 04 m dug into the riverbed to a depth of approx 0 50 0 70 m the spacing of the dowels was approx 0 40 m fig 3 wicker sticks obtained from nearby willow bushes were interwoven between the dowels giving the construction an openwork character fig 4 the first dowels were dug at a small depth into the bank creating the so called groyne the purpose of which was to protect the deflector from being scoured from the bank which would have greatly reduced its efficiency positioning the deflectors at a 70 80 co current angle was beneficial due to the greater efficiency of deforming the streamline and accelerating the process of changing the morphology of the riverbed as time passed the deflectors suffered minor damage due to their relatively fragile structure this required regular repairs carried out during systematic survey trips the repairs included filling in the wicker sticks and straightening the deformed structure which was scoured especially after the floods and the winter seasons when ice appeared on the river 3 2 methods the scope of the study included both hydrometric measurements and hydrodynamic modelling of the river flows along the studied river section geodetic measurements were the primary source of data regarding changes in the bed shape the water surface level and cross sections cross sections were determined using pairs of dowels dug at opposite edges banks each pair of dowels was levelled and located using gps rtk surveying instruments the measurements were made with an optical level nicon ax 2s each time starting at a fixed levelled point the accuracy of dowel levelling was 0 002 m in addition the measurements were controlled by previously measured dowel ordinates marking the measurement cross sections the accuracy and repeatability of the measurements were ensured by a measuring tape unrolled always in the same way between the dowels and a spirit level this ensured that measurements were taken at the same cross sections with a location specific accuracy of approx 0 02 m this provided an opportunity to make comparisons of results across successive measurement sets regular measurements of the geometric variability of the riverbed were the basis for monitoring changes in the riverbed in the first stage the initial condition before the deflectors were constructed was determined in detail including the shape of river cross sections river banks and a fragment of the river valley near the flinta subsequently after the deflectors had been built 15 cross sections were marked out within which regular geodetic measurements were carried out during the period of 4 years in 2019 to more accurately document changes occurring upstream and downstream of the deflectors the number of cross sections was increased to 28 fig 3 a valeport model 801 hydrometric current meter was used for flow measurements from which averaged velocities from 10 instantaneous measurements were read accurate approx 0 01 m s 1 a scaled rod of the hydrometric current meter was used to read the depths providing measurement accuracy of 0 01 m measurements of water velocity in the bed allowed to determine flow magnitudes and velocity distributions analysis of the results for different data and flow variants resulted in the analysis of the effect of deflectors on roughness coefficient values for the studied river section the 1 d hec ras 5 0 6 software was used to calibrate the model and determine roughness coefficients in the bed for each cross section 4 measurements and hydrodynamic models measurements were made at hydrometric plumbs spaced 0 50 m apart with the first plumb 0 50 m from the point where the water surface meets the bank in plumbs velocities were measured at the depths of 0 01 0 02 0 03 0 05 0 10 0 15 m and further at every 0 10 m in the additional 2019 cross sections plumbs were spaced 1 0 m apart while velocity was measured depending on the ability to make measurements in a single day at the depths of 0 01 0 05 0 10 0 15 m and further at every 0 10 m the first flow velocity measurements in 2018 were made at 9 cross sections numbers 6 8 10 13 15 17 20 22 24 including 3 nos 8 15 and 22 of them at deflector cross sections and 6 at cross sections 2 m downstream and upstream of the structures the following measurements were taken on 23 july and 11 october 2008 from 2019 the number of cross sections where speed distribution measurements were recorded was increased to 20 numbers 1 2 3 4 6 8 10 11 12 13 15 17 18 19 20 22 24 26 27 28 and the measurements were made on may 30 and october 23 based on hydrometric measurements water flow rate values were assessed using the calculation method in accordance with the recommendations of the institute of meteorology and water management in poland polish abbreviation imgw pn en iso 2009 these values were then used in the modeling process in order to compare the changes occurring in the studied section results from four measurement cycles with similar flow rate values were selected for the analysis table 1 daily flow data from the ryczywół water gauge obtained from imgw for the period 1981 2015 were used to estimate the 1 flow the maximum likelihood method was used as described in the methodology recommended by the national water management authority polish abbreviation kzgw now national water management authority polish water according to the method of calculating maximum flows rate with defined probability of exceedance for controlled and uncontrolled catchments association of polish hydrologists 2017 the 1 d steady flow hec ras model hec usace army mil2021 was used usace 2010 in line with the postulates of chow chow 1959 and chang chang 2008 presenting in detail flow velocity energy as well as other hydraulic equations to determine all analyzed hydraulic parameters as well as water stages for specific flood discharges in the studied cross sections of the flinta river string models were created for cross sections where the hydraulic gradient was calculated based on cross sectional geometry elevation of successive cross sections and the distance between them a mixed flow regime mode was used for the modeling model calibration was conducted using the findings of brandimarte and baldassarre brandimarte and baldassarre 2012 gibson et al 2017 and usace 2010 for the purpose of this study thirteen 1 d independent models in hec ras for four sets of survey cross sections and hydrometric measurements were constructed for the first set before the installation of the deflectors one model called model 0 was built for three subsequent sets deflectors were implemented in hec ras as a cross section modification a deflector is implemented to hec ras as a modified river bank as if it was a part of it b overflow a deflector is implemented to hec ras as a hydraulic structure in the cross section for the purpose of calibration the c overflow capacity factor was selected which characterizes the flow of the structure c manning s coefficient modification in one cross section a deflector is implemented into hec ras as an increase in roughness in the cross section in which it is physically built and d manning s coefficient modification in five cross sections a deflector is implemented to hec ras as an increase in roughness in 5 cross sections 2 upstream and 2 downstream of it and in the cross section where it is physically built a scheme of the adopted research plan is shown in fig 5 the modification of the cross sections a was based on changing their shape depending on the dimensions of the deflectors a this resulted in cross sections with a limited active part the 1 d hec ras software allows deflectors to be included in the mathematical model also as overflows b the software should adopt one of two overflow types with a wide top or practical shape the shape of the objects coincided with the shape of the cross sections that represented them in the first approach fig 8 calculations were conducted according to of the following formula 1 q c l h 3 2 where q flow rate m3 s 1 c overflow capacity factor m1 2 s 1 l overflow length m h the difference in elevation of the energy line and of the overflow m the calculation adopted an overflow scheme with a practical shape a flow rate of 1 4 m1 2 s 1 was also selected when flow deflectors were included by changing the roughness locally the bed coefficients were modified in one cross section c at the deflector spindle or in five cross sections at the deflector spindle and in two cross sections upstream and downstream d normal depth was used as the downstream boundary condition while the flow derived from hydrometric measurements was used as the upstream boundary condition the downstream boundary condition was adopted in the first cross section km 0 000 of the model while the upstream boundary condition was adopted in the 28th cross section km 0 155 of the model the models were calibrated based on the available data i e flow rate and water surface elevation at the time of the measurement validation of the models was carried out based on the water surface elevations and flow rate data derived from four field trips manning coefficients were adjusted until the obtained model results were consistent with measurements the above was done for model variants in which the deflectors were implemented as modified river banks variant a for the other variants b d the same roughness coefficients were applied along the length of the section local changes to the manning coefficients were applied for variants c and d the above information is summarized in table 2 twenty eight cross sections were included in each model in the model developed for calculations for 1 discharge a bridge located at km 0 020 was additionally considered calculations for the bridge were conducted using the energy equation in which the bridge structure is considered as a normal bed cross section but the cross sectional area is reduced by the area of the structure and the wetted perimeter is increased by the elements in contact with the water because the geodetically measured cross sections were too short for the 1 water simulation they were extended to cover the entire floodplain the shape of the cross sections was developed based on a 1 m resolution numerical terrain model nmt obtained from gugik head office of geodesy and cartography manning roughness coefficient in the floodplain was assumed based on field vision at n 0 045 m 1 3 s1 cao et al 2011 the original roughness coefficients were changed in subsequent iterations until a water surface profile for the riverbed consistent with the measurements was obtained for all the models developed additional simulations were performed taking into account the most frequent flows of 0 18 m3 s 1 and 0 20 m3 s 1 five simulations for a 1 flow rate of 11 97 m3 s 1 were also performed and they concerned the models developed from geodetic measurements taken during the first 23 07 2018 and last 23 10 2019 field trips a total of 44 simulations were performed and they are presented in table 3 5 results 5 1 field measurements field measurements and analysis of the results showed the magnitude of the transformations induced by the introduction of deflectors into the regulated river channel a comparison of changes in the channel geometry in the profiles with installed deflectors and their vicinity and the control profiles over a period of 2 years shows the increased dynamics of the changes taking place the greatest changes in the profile were observed 1 2 m downstream of the deflectors for example the lateral erosion of the channel in the period in question in the profile downstream of deflector no 1 profile no 7 was the greatest observed and amounted to 0 32 m fig 6 for the profiles near deflector no 2 profile no 14 the difference was 0 21 m while in profile 21 downstream of deflector no 3 the erosion was 0 28 m the lateral change of the channel in the control profile profile 27 above the impact of the structure was 0 09 m on the other hand vertical changes in the riverbed system took the highest values in the deflector profile and up to 1 m downstream in profile 7 it was about 0 08 m for profile 14 the erosion was 0 07 m while it was 0 10 m in profile 21 in the intermediate profiles between the deflectors changes in the position of the riverbed were visible reaching up to 0 05 m in places depth erosion in the control profile was approximately 0 02 0 03 m and it was associated with a shift in the current line from the left bank towards the right bank an accumulation of riverbed sediments was observed at the location of the previous streamline depth erosion was also accompanied by accumulation phenomena and diameter changes in the bottom sediments below the control profile sediments accumulation was observed in the profiles downstream of the deflectors on the same bank as the structure the distance over which the material was deposited was generally in the range of 2 5 m downstream of the deflector investigations of the grain size distribution showed an intensive process of grain sorting in the current line in the profiles 1 m downstream of the deflectors where water velocities were greater the sediment size d50 median grain size increased from 0 31 mm to 3 9 mm fig 7 a which was indicative of an increase in the proportion of gravels and stones in the areas of accumulation upstream of the deflectors on the other hand the phenomenon took the opposite course and the authoritative diameter d50 decreased from 2 4 mm to 0 18 mm fig 7b this coincided with a decrease in flow velocity in the zone upstream of the deflector in the control profile the changes in sediment contribution were small and no special differences were observed over the study period based on the collected and analyzed measurement data the hydrodynamic models were calibrated after the simulation the calculation results characteristic of individual cross sections were exported to a file the most important characteristic results are summarized in table 4 these results mostly match measured data with the largest observed difference of 0 02 m average flow velocities were also similar to those observed in the field studies and ranged from 0 13 m s 1 to 0 27 m s 1 however the flow deflectors greatly altered velocity distributions in the cross sections pascale et al 2005 leslie et al 2007 construction of deflectors resulted in shifting of the current line and differentiation of velocity distributions which can be observed e g section 22 fig 8 the high concentration of flow in the rest of the bed is evident in increased velocities thus the part of the cross section in the shadow of the deflector has significantly lower velocities compared to the results before the construction of deflectors similar observations were reported by the us bureau of reclamations 2010 and leslie leslie 2010 5 2 modelling modelling results for a flow of 0 20 m3 s 1 are shown in fig 9 it also marks changes in the riverbed shape after the implementation of deflectors over a 2 year period modelling results for 1 flow are presented in fig 10 the simulation for the model before the implementation of deflectors 23 07 2018 and the data from the measurements in 23 10 2019 were compared in fig 10 a slight rise in the water surface near the deflectors is visible but this has a marginal effect on the final extent of the floodplain fig 9 presents the values of manning s coefficient caused by the construction of channel flow deflectors for measurements taken in october 2018 and 2019 the coefficient values are lower this may be due to lower vegetation in the bed as in the autumn period vegetation is normally lower on the other hand there is a noticeable increase in the value of the coefficient over time the same situation happens for measurements taken in july 2018 and may 2019 the coefficient values are higher due to vegetation but in this case also an increase in roughness coefficient values is evident over time after two years of the deflector operation changes in the bed morphology shallows pools and washouts behind the deflector head after the construction of deflectors contribute to an increase in the roughness coefficient value in the studied section similar observations were provided by gippel and kondolf gippel 1995 kondolf 1998 fig 11 shows average manning s coefficient values for the entire study section for the example variants on the other hand fig 12 presents the average values of manning s coefficient for each variant the modelling results for all variants of deflector implementation are also presented and compared to the situation before the implementation as an example in table 5 the water surface ordinates for the 1st variant w1 before dc and four variants a b c and d after dc for october 2019 are presented this allowed us to determine the differences in water surface patterns resulting from the implementation of deflectors the maximum differences did not exceed 6 cm the table below table 6 presents differences between the water surface levels for variant w27 and variants w28 w39 simulations were conducted for a flow of 0 2 m3 s the largest absolute differences are observed at the edge cross sections 6 discussion the determined values of the discharge coefficients for each deflector for different data sets for the flinta river research are presented in table 7 the discharge coefficients were determined by successive iterations of simulation on the model until the results water elevation values were as close as possible to the values obtained from the actual field measurements the averaged results indicate a higher value of the coefficient than recommended in the literature beechie et al 2006 brierley and fryirs 2005 sear et al 2003 this may be due to the character of natural deflectors which include wicker ones when analyzing all the variants of deflector implementation in the one dimensional modelling system the study showed that the variant in which deflectors served as a change in the manning s coefficient value performed best this is illustrated in fig 13 which shows the average and maximum differences between the model results and water surface measurements the cross section directly upstream the deflectors was selected as a reference the smallest differences were obtained for variants c and d reaching values of 0 01 m while the largest maximum difference was recorded for variant a and it reached 0 06 m the average values of the variants do not exceed 0 02 m there are many studies on river restoration e g shields et al 2003 sear et al 2008 slaney et al 1997 opperman and merenlender 2004 pollock et al 2011 roni et al 2008 and

water management however they must be implemented based on detailed studies on the interaction between flow environmental conditions and aquatic organisms guo and zhang 2016 matisziwet al 2015 papanicolaou et al 2011 tyminski and mumot 2015 despite ongoing projects and increasing knowledge in this field further research is needed to clearly define environmental interactions related to hydraulic flow conditions yi et al 2014 rana et al 2017 radecki pawlik et al 2014 hydraulic and hydrological effects of river revitalization and restoration are complex and difficult to predict due to the lack of sufficient studies that have been conducted before and after restoration ser 2016 szałkiewicz et al 2019 kałuża et al 2018 kondolf 1995 mikuś et al 2016 although channel deflectors are used in rivers where it is necessary to move the streamline away from the bank to prevent bank scouring and erosion the example presented in this study indicates the possibility of other applications for this type of structure i e to increase river meandering matisziw et al 2015 clilverd et al 2016 in the literature it is well known that deflectors induce local erosion and cause local scouring it was observed during field measurements simulations and laboratory experiments pagliara and kurdistani 2016 biron et al 2004 biron et al 2005 biron et al 2012 carré et al 2007 zhou and endreny 2012 thompson et al 2002 radspinner et al 2010 on the basis of obtained results it was possible to assess usefulness of one dimensional model for river restoration purposes results showed in the field that strong erosion occurred at the bank opposite to the structures which is consistent with other studies using deflectors although one dimensional model has some advantages such as simple boundary designation and easier model calibration they cannot predict the complex flow field around structures niezgoda and johnson 2006 bockelmann et al 2004 gibson and pasternack 2016 nevertheless the choice of the dimensionality form of the model depends on the specific river engineering application in addition to constraints related to time and cost carré et al 2007 thus even if one dimensional model remains insufficient to plan restoration structures those may still be used in large scale simulations such as flooding and sediments flow such information is still useful when defining the model of ecological response defectors must extend above the average water level they influence river flow conditions the literature indicates that deflectors are most effective with high river flows and flow velocities exceeding 0 60 0 90 m s 1 adynkiewicz piragas and miszuk 2020 the presented case study confirmed the possibility of effective deflector operation also for velocities of 0 10 0 30 m s 1 the study of wicker deflectors also confirms recent literature reports on the possibility of using other plant species i e openwork structures made of cane wolski and tymiński 2020 tardío and mickovski 2016 or bamboo shoots tardio et al 2017 literature examples of successful restoration efforts show positive changes in river ecosystems after several years yi et al 2014 rana et al 2015 in this study the first beneficial change in the bed morphology was observed only after six months despite the increasingly widespread projects in this area further intensive research is still needed to clearly define interactions between the implementation of bed structures and the improvement of river ecosystems and local hydraulic flow conditions szałkiewicz et al 2019 kałuża et al 2020 7 conclusions the presented research has proved that well constructed restoration structures have negligible influence on the increase of the roughness coefficient and the deterioration in the capacity of large water channels and thus they do not increase the flood risk the influence of deflectors in the vertical and lateral processes has been seen as desirable for restoration efforts in the course of 15 months lateral erosion was 0 32 m and local erosion of the riverbed was 0 10 m moreover sorting of river sediment was observed from d50 0 31 mm to d50 3 9 mm downstream of the deflectors as well as accumulation of fine material and changes of sediment size to d50 0 18 mm previously d50 2 4 mm upstream of the deflectors measures to increase bedform diversity vary velocity distributions and change the bed sediment composition can be supported or even achieved by installing deflectors in the beds of small rivers and streams based on the presented results it can be concluded that the effect of deflectors on the average roughness at high water levels is insignificant and does not cause additional flood risk fig 11 for q1 flow the implementation of flow deflectors had no significant effect on the capacity of the studied river section only a slight subduction of 0 02 0 03 m of the water surface in the vicinity of the deflectors compared to the model from before the restoration activities could be observed their greatest impact is observed at low water levels and low flows and thus they have a beneficial effect on the processes occurring in the river bed the literature on the subject indicates that deflectors are most effective with high river flows and flow velocities exceeding 0 60 0 90 m s 1 adynkiewicz piragas and miszuk 2020 the presented case study confirmed the possibility of effective deflector operation also for velocities of 0 10 0 30 m s 1 based on the work carried out and the data collected it can be concluded that openwork flow deflectors have a significant influence on the shape of the riverbed fig 10 and 11 we can observe high dynamics of changes in the bed that involve its shape and velocities fig 8 the large variation in average roughness for the studied bed may indicate the influence of deflectors but also changes due to vegetation in the bed which is also promoted by the use of deflectors the results showed little difference in the average roughness coefficients for the entire section compared to the baseline model for q1 flow the differences in the roughness coefficient values were negligible the way the channel deflectors were implemented in the one dimensional hydrodynamic model also had little effect on the results in turn it has been shown that in the case of one dimensional models the implementation of flow deflectors in the form of a local bed roughness increase is the most advantageous solution the presented results can be considered universal in relation to typical regulated and straightened small lowland watercourses with a sandy river bed the advantage and novelty of the presented research results from determining high dynamics of favorable changes already several months after the construction of the deflectors the research presented here in the form of a case study can be related to the possibility of popularizing the use of simple and low cost measures to improve ecological conditions of the watercourse they can also be an element recommended in both national and international good practices for the maintenance and restoration of small rivers it is important to continue the research undertaken which will determine the impact of self and deflector induced restoration on organisms and the river ecological status another aim may be to investigate differences in the rate of self and

929,river channel deflectors are environmentally friendly low head hydraulic structures constructed from wood stones and coarse gravel their aim is to protect river banks against erosion to change the direction of river flow making the river course naturally meandrous instead of artificially straight to provide natural refugia for fish and invertebrates and finally to improve hydraulic discharge conditions however from the designing point of view they are difficult to represent in hydrodynamic models since they are constructed and fixed in the river bed differently for this reason in hydraulic models deflectors may be treated as modifications to the value of the watercourse bed roughness or reduction in the active part of the cross section thus to test the suitability of one dimensional models for river restoration involving river deflectors a 1 d numerical model of the lower section of the flinta river wielkopolska province poland was prepared to do that firstly three channel flow deflectors were constructed and installed in the lower section of the flinta river secondly hydrometric measurements were continued systematically over three years next based on field studies and field data calculations were made using the hec ras 1 d software several variants of the shape and the effect of deflectors were tested on this basis the variability of the roughness coefficient value for the flinta riverbed after the implementation of deflectors was analyzed the novelty of the research is that the obtained results show that river channel deflectors have a significant influence on the processes of morphological changes such as velocity distribution grain size changes tendency towards channel meandering channel slope of the riverbed and thus also on changes in hydromorphological parameters of river flow the presented case study confirmed the potential for effective deflector operation for the velocity range of 0 10 0 30 m s 1 the maximum changes of the river bed elevation after the deflectors had been introduced reached 0 10 m it was also found that the effect of deflectors on roughness at high water levels was non significant and did not increase the risk of flooding for q1 flow the implementation of flow deflectors had no significant effect on the capacity of the studied river section only slight subduction of 0 02 0 03 m of the water surface in the vicinity of the deflectors could be observed compared to the model from before the restoration activities the greatest impact of the channel deflectors is seen at low water levels and low flows that do not exceed average flow values finally it was shown that the best solution to implement deflectors into a one dimensional model is to consider their influence as a change in the value of manning s coefficient the obtained results can be considered universal in relation to typical transformed small lowland watercourses that have been straightened and regulated and are to be subjectedto the process of river restoration keywords roughness coefficient river channel deflector the flinta river 1 d hec ras model hydromorphology river restoration 1 introduction the destruction of valuable water and water dependent habitats as well as the loss of their eco systemic impact has led in many cases to an increased awareness of the importance of these habitats yi et al 2014 radecki pawlik 2015 this became the basis for more conscious management of environmental resources and the spread of knowledge concerning the importance of this problem rana et al 2017 roni and beechie 2012 as a result large scale efforts have begun to be made not only concerning the maintenance and protection of current river conditions but also river restoration and revitalization dufour and piegay 2009 elkins et al 2007 this is also reflected in the provisions of national law polish water law 2017 as well as international documents e g the water framework directive the water framework directive wfd or 2000 60 ec directive of the european parliament and the council of 23 october 2000 water framework directive establishing a framework for community action in the field of water policy is in force throughout the european union and obliges all the member states to protect watercourses and water reservoirs the directive imposes the obligation to make all possible attempts to improve the condition of watercourses and water reservoirs to ensure at least their good condition these regulations together with other eu regulations support the restoration of watercourses roni

ecosystem that is resilient and sustainable through such activities is not always obvious and realistic a method that can significantly support the process of planning and selecting appropriate measures to improve the ecological status of the river can be the properly conducted using hydrodynamic modelling cao et al 2011 tyminski 2012 radecki pawlik 2014 hydraulic models can provide information on flows depths and changes in elevation laks et al 2017 guo and zhang 2016 walczak et al 2018 all these elements affect the biological and hydromorphological parameters of rivers that are being restored radecki pawlik 2014 szałkiewicz et al 2019 this applies in particular to changes in the value of the channel roughness coefficient after the implemented revitalization measures for the section in which a set of flow deflectors was installed szałkiewicz et al 2019 thompson and stull 2002 niezgoda and johnson 2006 in the above context river restoration requires a comprehensive approach including engineering tasks e g methods for the prediction of hydraulic hydromorphological and ecological restoration outcomes bockelmann et al 2004 such opportunities are provided by hydraulic and eco hydraulic modeling yi et al 2014 rana et al 2017 elkins et al 2007 laks et al 2017 guo and zhang 2016 miwa and parker 2012 gibson and pasternack 2016 greene et al 2013 matisziw et al 2015 papanicolaou et al 2011 models can be used in two ways first those may approximate past and forecast conditions in the riverbed and at the floodplains which may give an overall picture of the whole system secondly more specific changes caused by restoration measures and techniques may be assessed before implementation pagliara and kurdistani 2016 palmer at al 2005 river channel flow deflectors are a type of hydraulic structures made of stone gabions wood or fascine lenar et al 2009 kałuża et al 2018 they are incorporated into the river at every 5 7 channel widths which is connected with the riffle pool sequence distance in rivers radecki pawlik 2014 they direct flows and are often implemented to create a ramp for fish rana et al 2017 lenar matyas et al 2009 expressed an opinion that deflectors increase bed roughness of mountain and lowland rivers and when properly positioned they force the direction of the flow aerate the stream and contribute to the self purification of the watercourse they are applied not only in river engineering but also to protect water banks and shores biron et al 2004 including seashores deflectors used in river revitalization and restoration treatments are described as a series of low structures in the bed that irregularly narrow the bed causing variation in flow velocity reducing local erosion and accumulation pan et al 2016 beckers et al 2015 to avoid uncontrolled riverbank scour erosion and significant flow disturbance deflectors are small and their impact is limited river channel deflectors are used successfully for both mountain and submontane rivers and lowland rivers however this requires different construction techniques and use of materials fig 1 the materials and design of deflectors are determined by the operating conditions of the structure susceptibility to deterioration and availability of local materials zaborowski et al 2021 this study aimed to analyze changes in the values of averaged roughness coefficients for the bed of a lowland river in which a set of channel deflectors was introduced as a means to initiate restoration processes this issue is extremely important in terms of assessing the impact of these treatments on water flow conditions our paper analyzes the variability of the roughness coefficient value for the flinta river bed after the implementation of river restoration structures in the form of river channel deflectors after consultations with the regional water management board in poznan rzgw the authors designed and constructed deflectors in the flinta riverbed this river was selected as a part of the national program for the renaturalization of surface waters in poland pawlaczyk 2020 and a team of researchers from the poznań university of life sciences had already carried out rrenaturalization related research projects on this section of the flinta e g kałuża et al 2018 the research showed that the watercourse has a high ecological potential and the team started to look for opportunities to improve its ecological status by restoring meanders of the flinta on the basis of the performed research the effect of deflectors on flow resistance was determined for low medium and high water flows finally the accuracy of output parameters indicating the impact of river deflectors was tested firstly to solve a problem with the definition of small instream hydraulic structures a set of deflectors was built in the river reach then it was introduced into the 1 d model in various possible variants including modifications of cross sections simulations were performed using the hec ras 5 0 6 software two calculation variants were tested 1 the channel without deflectors and 2 the channel after the structures had been introduced with 4 different methods of entering deflectors into the model the main practical output of our research and simulation show the applicability of 1d models to analyze simple river management low head hydraulic structures in our case fascine low head hydraulics deflectors the obtained results can be considered universal in relation to typical transformed small lowland watercourses that have been straightened and regulated the novelty of the presented research is connected with the reference of the results of field research carried out systematically for almost three years to obtained 1 d model outputs and then to draw specific conclusions 2 description of the researched river section the research facility is located near the village of rożnowo młyn in the rogoźno commune wielkopolska province poland and it is an estuarial fragment of the flinta river which is a right tributary of the wełna river fig 2 based on the water framework directive wfd 2000 the flinta river is classified as a lowland sandy stream the length of the river is 27 km and its catchment area is 345 47 km2 like most watercourses in poland it has been strongly transformed as a result of regulatory and land reclamation activities carried out in both the 19th and 20th centuries szałkiewicz et al 2022a żelazo 2006 żelazo popek 2014 the transformations made in the 19th century were carried out for the needs of agriculture meadows and pastures there is one water gauge station on the flinta located in ryczywół km 14 355 szałkiewicz et al 2022b the length of the river is 27 km and its catchment area is 345 47 km2 one water gauge station on the flinta is located in ryczywół km 14 355 szałkiewicz et al 2022b publicly available hydrological data cover the period since 1951 characteristic flows are shown in table 1 hydrological analyses indicated that at the ryczywół water gauge station flows in the range of 0 1 0 2 m3 s occurred most frequently during the 1951 2014 period 13 6 of all days in the multi year period according to the physiographic division kondracki 1994 the flinta is located in the pojezierze chodzieskie mesoregion the estuary section which is at the same time the longest section of the flinta river flows through the ryczywół commune comprising also valuable natural areas paluch 2009 apart from the noteć forest there are also two natura 2000 zones in in the commune of ryczywół under the habitats directive the chlebowo swamp plh300016 and the wełna valley plh300043 among large scale nature conservation areas in the ryczywół commune there are also protected landscape areas the wełna valley based on research conducted using the river habitat survey rhs method szoszkiewicz et al 2020 the investigated section on the flinta river was classified as significantly modified and was assigned class iv szoszkiewicz et al 2020 raven et al 1998 the average slope of the riverbed is about 0 75 with lower gradients in the upper and middle stretches where the river valley is wide and flat along the downstream part of the river in the length of 11 km the valley becomes narrower and the channel slope increases the studied river reach is nearly 160 m long and is characterized by a drop of the water level of ca 1 3 3 materials and methods 3 1 materials openwork fascine deflectors were selected for the study as eco friendly and easy to build structures of simple design the location of deflectors in the estuarine section of the flinta river was not accidental namely the selected section is where basket studies had already been conducted kałuża et al 2015 kałuża et al 2016 and which due to the shape of the valley the geological structure of the bed fine sands medium sands and gravels and intensive sediment transport is susceptible to transformation wicker deflectors were made according to literature recommendations pagliara and kurdistani 2016 they were designed to obstruct approx 1 3 of the width of the riverbed the deflector spacing was approx 5 times the width of the river the deflectors were constructed from pine dowels with a diameter of approx 0 04 m dug into the riverbed to a depth of approx 0 50 0 70 m the spacing of the dowels was approx 0 40 m fig 3 wicker sticks obtained from nearby willow bushes were interwoven between the dowels giving the construction an openwork character fig 4 the first dowels were dug at a small depth into the bank creating the so called groyne the purpose of which was to protect the deflector from being scoured from the bank which would have greatly reduced its efficiency positioning the deflectors at a 70 80 co current angle was beneficial due to the greater efficiency of deforming the streamline and accelerating the process of changing the morphology of the riverbed as time passed the deflectors suffered minor damage due to their relatively fragile structure this required regular repairs carried out during systematic survey trips the repairs included filling in the wicker sticks and straightening the deformed structure which was scoured especially after the floods and the winter seasons when ice appeared on the river 3 2 methods the scope of the study included both hydrometric measurements and hydrodynamic modelling of the river flows along the studied river section geodetic measurements were the primary source of data regarding changes in the bed shape the water surface level and cross sections cross sections were determined using pairs of dowels dug at opposite edges banks each pair of dowels was levelled and located using gps rtk surveying instruments the measurements were made with an optical level nicon ax 2s each time starting at a fixed levelled point the accuracy of dowel levelling was 0 002 m in addition the measurements were controlled by previously measured dowel ordinates marking the measurement cross sections the accuracy and repeatability of the measurements were ensured by a measuring tape unrolled always in the same way between the dowels and a spirit level this ensured that measurements were taken at the same cross sections with a location specific accuracy of approx 0 02 m this provided an opportunity to make comparisons of results across successive measurement sets regular measurements of the geometric variability of the riverbed were the basis for monitoring changes in the riverbed in the first stage the initial condition before the deflectors were constructed was determined in detail including the shape of river cross sections river banks and a fragment of the river valley near the flinta subsequently after the deflectors had been built 15 cross sections were marked out within which regular geodetic measurements were carried out during the period of 4 years in 2019 to more accurately document changes occurring upstream and downstream of the deflectors the number of cross sections was increased to 28 fig 3 a valeport model 801 hydrometric current meter was used for flow measurements from which averaged velocities from 10 instantaneous measurements were read accurate approx 0 01 m s 1 a scaled rod of the hydrometric current meter was used to read the depths providing measurement accuracy of 0 01 m measurements of water velocity in the bed allowed to determine flow magnitudes and velocity distributions analysis of the results for different data and flow variants resulted in the analysis of the effect of deflectors on roughness coefficient values for the studied river section the 1 d hec ras 5 0 6 software was used to calibrate the model and determine roughness coefficients in the bed for each cross section 4 measurements and hydrodynamic models measurements were made at hydrometric plumbs spaced 0 50 m apart with the first plumb 0 50 m from the point where the water surface meets the bank in plumbs velocities were measured at the depths of 0 01 0 02 0 03 0 05 0 10 0 15 m and further at every 0 10 m in the additional 2019 cross sections plumbs were spaced 1 0 m apart while velocity was measured depending on the ability to make measurements in a single day at the depths of 0 01 0 05 0 10 0 15 m and further at every 0 10 m the first flow velocity measurements in 2018 were made at 9 cross sections numbers 6 8 10 13 15 17 20 22 24 including 3 nos 8 15 and 22 of them at deflector cross sections and 6 at cross sections 2 m downstream and upstream of the structures the following measurements were taken on 23 july and 11 october 2008 from 2019 the number of cross sections where speed distribution measurements were recorded was increased to 20 numbers 1 2 3 4 6 8 10 11 12 13 15 17 18 19 20 22 24 26 27 28 and the measurements were made on may 30 and october 23 based on hydrometric measurements water flow rate values were assessed using the calculation method in accordance with the recommendations of the institute of meteorology and water management in poland polish abbreviation imgw pn en iso 2009 these values were then used in the modeling process in order to compare the changes occurring in the studied section results from four measurement cycles with similar flow rate values were selected for the analysis table 1 daily flow data from the ryczywół water gauge obtained from imgw for the period 1981 2015 were used to estimate the 1 flow the maximum likelihood method was used as described in the methodology recommended by the national water management authority polish abbreviation kzgw now national water management authority polish water according to the method of calculating maximum flows rate with defined probability of exceedance for controlled and uncontrolled catchments association of polish hydrologists 2017 the 1 d steady flow hec ras model hec usace army mil2021 was used usace 2010 in line with the postulates of chow chow 1959 and chang chang 2008 presenting in detail flow velocity energy as well as other hydraulic equations to determine all analyzed hydraulic parameters as well as water stages for specific flood discharges in the studied cross sections of the flinta river string models were created for cross sections where the hydraulic gradient was calculated based on cross sectional geometry elevation of successive cross sections and the distance between them a mixed flow regime mode was used for the modeling model calibration was conducted using the findings of brandimarte and baldassarre brandimarte and baldassarre 2012 gibson et al 2017 and usace 2010 for the purpose of this study thirteen 1 d independent models in hec ras for four sets of survey cross sections and hydrometric measurements were constructed for the first set before the installation of the deflectors one model called model 0 was built for three subsequent sets deflectors were implemented in hec ras as a cross section modification a deflector is implemented to hec ras as a modified river bank as if it was a part of it b overflow a deflector is implemented to hec ras as a hydraulic structure in the cross section for the purpose of calibration the c overflow capacity factor was selected which characterizes the flow of the structure c manning s coefficient modification in one cross section a deflector is implemented into hec ras as an increase in roughness in the cross section in which it is physically built and d manning s coefficient modification in five cross sections a deflector is implemented to hec ras as an increase in roughness in 5 cross sections 2 upstream and 2 downstream of it and in the cross section where it is physically built a scheme of the adopted research plan is shown in fig 5 the modification of the cross sections a was based on changing their shape depending on the dimensions of the deflectors a this resulted in cross sections with a limited active part the 1 d hec ras software allows deflectors to be included in the mathematical model also as overflows b the software should adopt one of two overflow types with a wide top or practical shape the shape of the objects coincided with the shape of the cross sections that represented them in the first approach fig 8 calculations were conducted according to of the following formula 1 q c l h 3 2 where q flow rate m3 s 1 c overflow capacity factor m1 2 s 1 l overflow length m h the difference in elevation of the energy line and of the overflow m the calculation adopted an overflow scheme with a practical shape a flow rate of 1 4 m1 2 s 1 was also selected when flow deflectors were included by changing the roughness locally the bed coefficients were modified in one cross section c at the deflector spindle or in five cross sections at the deflector spindle and in two cross sections upstream and downstream d normal depth was used as the downstream boundary condition while the flow derived from hydrometric measurements was used as the upstream boundary condition the downstream boundary condition was adopted in the first cross section km 0 000 of the model while the upstream boundary condition was adopted in the 28th cross section km 0 155 of the model the models were calibrated based on the available data i e flow rate and water surface elevation at the time of the measurement validation of the models was carried out based on the water surface elevations and flow rate data derived from four field trips manning coefficients were adjusted until the obtained model results were consistent with measurements the above was done for model variants in which the deflectors were implemented as modified river banks variant a for the other variants b d the same roughness coefficients were applied along the length of the section local changes to the manning coefficients were applied for variants c and d the above information is summarized in table 2 twenty eight cross sections were included in each model in the model developed for calculations for 1 discharge a bridge located at km 0 020 was additionally considered calculations for the bridge were conducted using the energy equation in which the bridge structure is considered as a normal bed cross section but the cross sectional area is reduced by the area of the structure and the wetted perimeter is increased by the elements in contact with the water because the geodetically measured cross sections were too short for the 1 water simulation they were extended to cover the entire floodplain the shape of the cross sections was developed based on a 1 m resolution numerical terrain model nmt obtained from gugik head office of geodesy and cartography manning roughness coefficient in the floodplain was assumed based on field vision at n 0 045 m 1 3 s1 cao et al 2011 the original roughness coefficients were changed in subsequent iterations until a water surface profile for the riverbed consistent with the measurements was obtained for all the models developed additional simulations were performed taking into account the most frequent flows of 0 18 m3 s 1 and 0 20 m3 s 1 five simulations for a 1 flow rate of 11 97 m3 s 1 were also performed and they concerned the models developed from geodetic measurements taken during the first 23 07 2018 and last 23 10 2019 field trips a total of 44 simulations were performed and they are presented in table 3 5 results 5 1 field measurements field measurements and analysis of the results showed the magnitude of the transformations induced by the introduction of deflectors into the regulated river channel a comparison of changes in the channel geometry in the profiles with installed deflectors and their vicinity and the control profiles over a period of 2 years shows the increased dynamics of the changes taking place the greatest changes in the profile were observed 1 2 m downstream of the deflectors for example the lateral erosion of the channel in the period in question in the profile downstream of deflector no 1 profile no 7 was the greatest observed and amounted to 0 32 m fig 6 for the profiles near deflector no 2 profile no 14 the difference was 0 21 m while in profile 21 downstream of deflector no 3 the erosion was 0 28 m the lateral change of the channel in the control profile profile 27 above the impact of the structure was 0 09 m on the other hand vertical changes in the riverbed system took the highest values in the deflector profile and up to 1 m downstream in profile 7 it was about 0 08 m for profile 14 the erosion was 0 07 m while it was 0 10 m in profile 21 in the intermediate profiles between the deflectors changes in the position of the riverbed were visible reaching up to 0 05 m in places depth erosion in the control profile was approximately 0 02 0 03 m and it was associated with a shift in the current line from the left bank towards the right bank an accumulation of riverbed sediments was observed at the location of the previous streamline depth erosion was also accompanied by accumulation phenomena and diameter changes in the bottom sediments below the control profile sediments accumulation was observed in the profiles downstream of the deflectors on the same bank as the structure the distance over which the material was deposited was generally in the range of 2 5 m downstream of the deflector investigations of the grain size distribution showed an intensive process of grain sorting in the current line in the profiles 1 m downstream of the deflectors where water velocities were greater the sediment size d50 median grain size increased from 0 31 mm to 3 9 mm fig 7 a which was indicative of an increase in the proportion of gravels and stones in the areas of accumulation upstream of the deflectors on the other hand the phenomenon took the opposite course and the authoritative diameter d50 decreased from 2 4 mm to 0 18 mm fig 7b this coincided with a decrease in flow velocity in the zone upstream of the deflector in the control profile the changes in sediment contribution were small and no special differences were observed over the study period based on the collected and analyzed measurement data the hydrodynamic models were calibrated after the simulation the calculation results characteristic of individual cross sections were exported to a file the most important characteristic results are summarized in table 4 these results mostly match measured data with the largest observed difference of 0 02 m average flow velocities were also similar to those observed in the field studies and ranged from 0 13 m s 1 to 0 27 m s 1 however the flow deflectors greatly altered velocity distributions in the cross sections pascale et al 2005 leslie et al 2007 construction of deflectors resulted in shifting of the current line and differentiation of velocity distributions which can be observed e g section 22 fig 8 the high concentration of flow in the rest of the bed is evident in increased velocities thus the part of the cross section in the shadow of the deflector has significantly lower velocities compared to the results before the construction of deflectors similar observations were reported by the us bureau of reclamations 2010 and leslie leslie 2010 5 2 modelling modelling results for a flow of 0 20 m3 s 1 are shown in fig 9 it also marks changes in the riverbed shape after the implementation of deflectors over a 2 year period modelling results for 1 flow are presented in fig 10 the simulation for the model before the implementation of deflectors 23 07 2018 and the data from the measurements in 23 10 2019 were compared in fig 10 a slight rise in the water surface near the deflectors is visible but this has a marginal effect on the final extent of the floodplain fig 9 presents the values of manning s coefficient caused by the construction of channel flow deflectors for measurements taken in october 2018 and 2019 the coefficient values are lower this may be due to lower vegetation in the bed as in the autumn period vegetation is normally lower on the other hand there is a noticeable increase in the value of the coefficient over time the same situation happens for measurements taken in july 2018 and may 2019 the coefficient values are higher due to vegetation but in this case also an increase in roughness coefficient values is evident over time after two years of the deflector operation changes in the bed morphology shallows pools and washouts behind the deflector head after the construction of deflectors contribute to an increase in the roughness coefficient value in the studied section similar observations were provided by gippel and kondolf gippel 1995 kondolf 1998 fig 11 shows average manning s coefficient values for the entire study section for the example variants on the other hand fig 12 presents the average values of manning s coefficient for each variant the modelling results for all variants of deflector implementation are also presented and compared to the situation before the implementation as an example in table 5 the water surface ordinates for the 1st variant w1 before dc and four variants a b c and d after dc for october 2019 are presented this allowed us to determine the differences in water surface patterns resulting from the implementation of deflectors the maximum differences did not exceed 6 cm the table below table 6 presents differences between the water surface levels for variant w27 and variants w28 w39 simulations were conducted for a flow of 0 2 m3 s the largest absolute differences are observed at the edge cross sections 6 discussion the determined values of the discharge coefficients for each deflector for different data sets for the flinta river research are presented in table 7 the discharge coefficients were determined by successive iterations of simulation on the model until the results water elevation values were as close as possible to the values obtained from the actual field measurements the averaged results indicate a higher value of the coefficient than recommended in the literature beechie et al 2006 brierley and fryirs 2005 sear et al 2003 this may be due to the character of natural deflectors which include wicker ones when analyzing all the variants of deflector implementation in the one dimensional modelling system the study showed that the variant in which deflectors served as a change in the manning s coefficient value performed best this is illustrated in fig 13 which shows the average and maximum differences between the model results and water surface measurements the cross section directly upstream the deflectors was selected as a reference the smallest differences were obtained for variants c and d reaching values of 0 01 m while the largest maximum difference was recorded for variant a and it reached 0 06 m the average values of the variants do not exceed 0 02 m there are many studies on river restoration e g shields et al 2003 sear et al 2008 slaney et al 1997 opperman and merenlender 2004 pollock et al 2011 roni et al 2008 and

water management however they must be implemented based on detailed studies on the interaction between flow environmental conditions and aquatic organisms guo and zhang 2016 matisziwet al 2015 papanicolaou et al 2011 tyminski and mumot 2015 despite ongoing projects and increasing knowledge in this field further research is needed to clearly define environmental interactions related to hydraulic flow conditions yi et al 2014 rana et al 2017 radecki pawlik et al 2014 hydraulic and hydrological effects of river revitalization and restoration are complex and difficult to predict due to the lack of sufficient studies that have been conducted before and after restoration ser 2016 szałkiewicz et al 2019 kałuża et al 2018 kondolf 1995 mikuś et al 2016 although channel deflectors are used in rivers where it is necessary to move the streamline away from the bank to prevent bank scouring and erosion the example presented in this study indicates the possibility of other applications for this type of structure i e to increase river meandering matisziw et al 2015 clilverd et al 2016 in the literature it is well known that deflectors induce local erosion and cause local scouring it was observed during field measurements simulations and laboratory experiments pagliara and kurdistani 2016 biron et al 2004 biron et al 2005 biron et al 2012 carré et al 2007 zhou and endreny 2012 thompson et al 2002 radspinner et al 2010 on the basis of obtained results it was possible to assess usefulness of one dimensional model for river restoration purposes results showed in the field that strong erosion occurred at the bank opposite to the structures which is consistent with other studies using deflectors although one dimensional model has some advantages such as simple boundary designation and easier model calibration they cannot predict the complex flow field around structures niezgoda and johnson 2006 bockelmann et al 2004 gibson and pasternack 2016 nevertheless the choice of the dimensionality form of the model depends on the specific river engineering application in addition to constraints related to time and cost carré et al 2007 thus even if one dimensional model remains insufficient to plan restoration structures those may still be used in large scale simulations such as flooding and sediments flow such information is still useful when defining the model of ecological response defectors must extend above the average water level they influence river flow conditions the literature indicates that deflectors are most effective with high river flows and flow velocities exceeding 0 60 0 90 m s 1 adynkiewicz piragas and miszuk 2020 the presented case study confirmed the possibility of effective deflector operation also for velocities of 0 10 0 30 m s 1 the

2016 or bamboo shoots tardio et al 2017 literature examples of successful restoration efforts show positive changes in river ecosystems after several years yi et al 2014 rana et al 2015 in this study the first beneficial change in the bed morphology was observed only after six months despite the increasingly widespread projects in this area further intensive research is still needed to clearly define interactions between the implementation of bed structures and the improvement of river ecosystems and local hydraulic flow conditions szałkiewicz et al 2019 kałuża et al 2020 7 conclusions the presented research has proved that well constructed restoration structures have negligible influence on the increase of the roughness coefficient and the deterioration in the capacity of large water channels and thus they do not increase the flood risk the influence of deflectors in the vertical and lateral processes has been seen as desirable for restoration efforts in the course of 15 months lateral erosion was 0 32 m and local erosion of the riverbed was 0 10 m moreover sorting of river sediment was observed from d50 0 31 mm to d50 3 9 mm downstream of the deflectors as well as accumulation of fine material and changes of sediment size to d50 0 18 mm previously d50 2 4 mm upstream of the deflectors measures to increase bedform diversity vary velocity distributions and change the bed sediment composition can be supported or even achieved by installing deflectors in the beds of small rivers and streams based on the presented results it can be concluded that the effect of deflectors on the average roughness at high water levels is insignificant and does not cause additional flood risk fig 11 for q1 flow the implementation of flow deflectors had no significant effect on the capacity of the studied river section only a slight subduction of 0 02 0 03 m of the water surface in the vicinity of the deflectors compared to the model from before the restoration activities could be observed their greatest impact is observed at low water levels and low flows and thus they have a beneficial effect on the processes occurring in the river bed the literature on the subject indicates that deflectors are most effective with high river flows and flow velocities exceeding 0 60 0 90 m s 1 adynkiewicz piragas and miszuk 2020 the presented case study confirmed the possibility of effective deflector operation also for velocities of 0 10 0 30 m s 1 based on the work carried out and the data collected it can be concluded that openwork flow deflectors have a significant influence on the shape of the riverbed fig 10 and 11 we can observe high dynamics of changes in the bed that involve its shape and velocities fig 8 the large variation in average roughness for the studied bed may indicate the influence of deflectors but also changes due to vegetation in the bed which is also promoted by the use of deflectors the results showed little difference in the average roughness coefficients for the entire section compared to the baseline model for q1 flow the differences in the roughness coefficient values were negligible the way the channel deflectors were implemented in the one dimensional hydrodynamic model also had little effect on the results in turn it has been shown that in the case of one dimensional models the implementation of flow deflectors in the form of a local bed roughness increase is the most advantageous solution the presented results can be considered universal in relation to typical regulated and straightened small lowland watercourses with a sandy river bed the advantage and novelty of the presented research results from determining high dynamics of favorable changes already several months after the construction of the deflectors the research presented here in the form of a case study can be related to the possibility of popularizing the use of simple and low cost measures to improve ecological conditions of the watercourse they can also be an element recommended in both national and international good practices for the maintenance and restoration of small rivers it is important to continue the research undertaken which will determine the impact of self and deflector induced restoration on organisms and the river ecological status another aim may be to investigate differences in the rate of self and
