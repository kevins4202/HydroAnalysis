3725,with intensified human influences on the terrestrial water cycle evapotranspiration et is changed even at a large river basin scale however there is no consensus about the significance of the human induced et change across river basins due to the uncertainties from the estimations of both observed and natural et at a large scale in this study the human influence on et is estimated over seven large river basins in the east asian monsoon region during 2003 2019 where the actual et estimations based on the water budget method using the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace and grace follow on terrestrial water storage change and the natural et estimations based on land surface modeling are compared the state of the art global reanalyses and the variable infiltration capacity vic land surface model are validated against naturalized runoff from the water resources bulletins and the vic model is found to outperform global reanalysis data over most southern river basins compared with the selected natural et model data that has a good performance of naturalized runoff the annual mean human induced et in the east asian monsoon region is estimated to range from

hanasaki et al 2007 hanasaki et al 2008 wada et al 2014 due to the lack of irrigation and reservoir regulation in most models therefore it is difficult to accurately simulate these human influences in

is no consensus on whether the reanalysis et is able to represent the natural hydrological processes over different river basins in this paper multi source modeled et products and actual et estimates

human influence on et was estimated by using the penman formula bai et al 2017 remote sensing retrieved surface water area zhao and gao 2018 and meteorological data 2 study area data and methods 2 1 study area the east asian monsoon region is located in the eurasia continent and faces the pacific ocean under the influence of monsoon climate the interaction among sea land and air is extremely complex the annual mean temperature decreases from south to north and the annual precipitation decreases from southeast coastal areas to inland from 2200 mm to 200 mm the climatic conditions are different in each basin the land area accounts for 46 of china and population accounts for 95 of china the east asian monsoon region is the most important economic and social development region in china it is also the region most sensitive to the impact of climate change and the region with the most prominent water resources issues it includes seven basins i e songliao river basin hai river basin yellow river basin huai river basin yangtze river basin southeast river basin and pearl river basin fig 1 2 2 data and methods 2 2 1 actual et estimates through water balance method in this study the actual et at basin scale is estimated by water balance method based on observed precipitation p runoff r obs terrestrial water storage change twsc and net water diversion wd rodell et al 2004 yeh et al 1998 at annual scales according to eq 1 1 e t o b s p r o b s t w s c w d water diversion at basin scale usually cannot be ignored especially for the water limited northern river basins which are heavily managed the basins are considered as closed watersheds and the groundwater inflow and outflow across the river basin boundary are considered to be negligible swenson and wahr 2006 here the precipitation observation is from the china meteorological forcing dataset cmfd with a spatial resolution of 0 1 degree which incorporates in situ meteorological observation data he et al 2020 kun and jie 2019 yang et al 2010 since the cmfd only provides data up to 2018 we extend the data to 2019 by interpolating observations from 699 stations provided by china meteorological administration cma the observed runoff and interbasin water transfer datasets are catchment accumulations from water resources bulletins for seven river basins precipitation and twsa are averaged over each basin to calculate et at river basin scale besides the naturalized runoff is also provided by water resource bulletins for each river basin which is calculated as the sum of the observed runoff and human water uses for agricultural irrigation domestic water supplies industry and reservoir regulation here the naturalized runoff is used to validate the performance of land surface models in simulating natural hydrological processes the launch of grace satellite in march 2002 provided a new method for accessing the tws information its successor grace follow on grace fo started in may 2018 to continue to provide the observation of the tws variations the terrestrial water storage anomaly twsa products were obtained from the center of space research of the university of texas at austin csr save and himanshu 2020 save et al 2016 the jet propulsion laboratory of the california institute of technology jpl landerer et al 2020 and the german research centre for geosciences gfz boergens et al 2019 here we used the latest sixth generation products rl06 from three institutions including rl06 csr and rl06 jpl using mascon solution and rl06 gfz using spherical harmonic solution sh to fill the missing values of grace and grace fo twsa during july 2017 may 2018 we first linearly interpolated the detrended time series of twsa after removing the seasonality and then added the trends and seasonality back the annual twsc was calculated by the difference between twsa in december in the target year and the year before the ensemble mean of twsc from csr jpl and gfz is used to reduce the uncertainty of grace products sakumura et al 2014 the twsc provided by grace includes both the natural and human variations the uncertainty of the annual twsc was mainly derived from the uncertainties of the two december twsa which was not accumulated from month to month here we chose the uncertainty of jpl mascon solution to represent the grace twsa uncertainty the uncertainties of each grid point are independent of each other so the regional mean uncertainty is obtained by the arithmetic average of the grid uncertainties 2 2 2 natural et from global reanalysis and vic land surface model natural et is the et estimation regardless of human activities including irrigation reservoir regulation and water diversion etc the natural et estimations from various global reanalysis products including era5 hersbach et al 2019 era5 land muñoz sabater 2019 gldasv2 1 and gldasv2 2 houser et al 2001 as well as those from the calibrated variable infiltration capacity vic model simulations were used in this study era5 and era5 land are the fifth generations of ecmwf global climate reanalysis data the spatial resolution of era5 is 0 25 and the temporal resolution of era5 is 1 h compared with era5 era5 land has a higher spatial resolution of 0 1degree gldasv2 1 consists of three models noah vic and catchment land surface model we used 1 degree monthly mean precipitation runoff and evapotranspiration from the three models above gldasv2 2 uses clsm f2 5 model operates under the forcing of meteorological analysis field of ecmwf comprehensive prediction system and assimilates data with grace because the data protocol with ecmwf gldasv2 2 does not provide meteorological forcing field here the runoff from the reanalysis products is multiplied by the ratios of reanalysis precipitation products to the observed precipitation to remove bias from precipitation forcing except for gldasv2 2 because of the absence of precipitation data we also simulated the natural et using vic from 2003 to 2019 vic is a conceptual semi distributed and grid based land surface hydrological model based on water and heat balance and physical dynamic mechanism the input data required for the vic model includes rainfall 10 m wind speed maximum and minimum surface air temperature soil data and vegetation data the vic model can output surface runoff baseflow evapotranspiration soil moisture etc yuan et al 2016 precipitation surface temperature and 10 m wind speed from cmfd and cma are used as meteorological forcing data to drive the vic model we used the parameters calibrated by zhang and yuan 2020 over the yellow river basin and the parameters calibrated by xie et al 2007 over the remaining six river basins the runoff from global reanalysis and vic model were compared against the naturalized runoff from the water resources bulletins to validate the performance of simulating natural hydrological processes to reduce the uncertainty from precipitation forcing we corrected the runoff and et data from the above global reanalysis on the basin scale by the ratio of cmfd cma precipitation observation to the precipitation from reanalysis products we calculate the standard deviation of the screened model and consider it as the uncertainty of the model if there is only one model after screening the uncertainty will not be calculated 2 2 3 reservoir evaporation there are 747 reservoirs over the study region including 68 reservoirs in the songliao river basin 40 reservoirs in the hai river basin 48 reservoirs in the yellow river basin 43 reservoirs in the huai river basin 367 reservoirs in the yangtze river basin 87 reservoirs in the southeast river basin and 94 reservoirs in the pearl river basin combined with the reservoir and dam information from the global reservoir dam database grand lehner et al 2011 a high quality global reservoir area time series data set grsad was generated which contained the monthly reservoir area series of 6817 global reservoirs from 1984 to 2015 zhao and gao 2018 the evaporation rate of reservoir surface was calculated by open water penman monteith potential evapotranspiration pet formula 2 pet δ δ γ r n g γ δ γ 6 43 1 0 536 u e s e a l v in which rn and g are net radiation at the surface and heat flux into the subsurface u is wind speed at 2 m height lv is latent heat es and ea are the saturated and actual vapor pressure δ is the slope of the vapor pressure curve and γ is the psychrometric constant the reservoir induced et change is considered as part of human induced et change in this study human induced et change is the difference between natural and observed et fig 2 3 δ e t e t o b s e t n a t where δet is considered to be the change of et caused by human activities such as reservoir regulation irrigation and land use land cover change et obs is the actual et estimate and et nat is the natural et estimated by lsms 3 results and discussion 3 1 evaluation of global reanalysis data precipitation is the most important input data of lsms and the accuracy of precipitation data determines the performance of runoff and et simulations liu et al 2016 nearing et al 2016 we compared precipitation from global reanalysis data with in situ precipitation observations at annual scale fig 3 the root means square errors are 33 255 mm year for the reanalysis data overall the precipitation from era5 and gldasv2 1 are larger than the observed precipitation with positive biases except for era5 over huai and southeast river basins the correlation coefficients range from 0 57 to 0 96 over different river basins the precipitation of gldasv2 1 was better than that of era5 over the hai yellow yangtze and pearl river basins in terms of rmse therefore it is necessary to reduce the error of precipitation to obtain more accurate estimations for natural hydrological variables fig 4 shows the naturalized and observed annual mean runoff from water resources bulletins for each river basin the naturalized runoff is used to verify the performances of simulated natural hydrological processes from global reanalysis and vic the observed runoff is smaller than the naturalized runoff due to human water abstraction for agriculture industry and domestic water supplies agricultural water use accounts for 52 74 of the total water use during 2003 2019 and the fraction of agricultural water use is most for the yellow river basin the decreases of runoff caused by human activity are 29 73 mm year which is 7 68 of naturalized runoff at the seven river basins the human influences on runoff are 23 68 62 and 30 over the songliao hai yellow and huai river basins which are higher than those over the yangtze river southeast river and pearl river basins where the water resources are more sufficient fig 5 shows the rmse and biases of basin averaged runoff from global reanalysis and vic and naturalized runoff from the water resources bulletins here the runoff from the reanalysis products is multiplied by the ratios of reanalysis precipitation products to the observed precipitation to remove bias from precipitation forcing except for gldasv2 2 because of the absence of precipitation data over the east asian monsoon river basins the basin averaged runoff from vic has relatively lower rmse and absolute bias than that of reanalysis data except for the hai and huai river basins except for the yellow river basin the parameters of vic were calibrated against observed runoff from 1980 to 2001 xie et al 2007 as the hai and huai river basins are strongly affected by human activities the calibrated vic may not represent the natural hydrological processes resulted in poor performance the yellow river is also heavily influenced by human but the naturalized runoff instead of observed runoff is used to calibrate the vic model zhang and yuan 2020 so the results are reasonable era5 era5 land gldas2 1 clsm gldas2 1 noah significantly underestimated runoff in the songliao yangtze southeast and pearl river basins here we assume if the models cannot simulate natural runoff reasonably they cannot well simulate natural et either we regard the et simulated by the model with good natural runoff simulation as the natural et gldas2 1 vic significantly overestimated the runoff over all basins which was removed in the following analysis in the songliao yangtze and pearl river basins the reanalysis data have poorer simulations of natural runoff than the vic simulated runoff so we only use the simulated et of vic as the natural et in the above mentioned basins 3 2 twsa from grace fig 6 shows the annual twsa of grace products retrieved by csr gfz and jpl the variations of twsa are influenced by the supply of precipitation the loss of surface water due to et and water abstractions the twsa shows significant declining trends over the hai yellow huai river basins during 2003 2019 especially for the hai river basin the trend of twsa over the hai river basin is 17 mm year which is mainly related to groundwater exploitation long et al 2020 and the declining trend of precipitation although there is an increasing trend of precipitation over the yellow river basin the twsa decreases for the southern river basins fig 6e g there are increasing trends of twsa p 0 01 which are possibly related to the increases in precipitation the increasing water storage over the yangtze southeast and pearl river basins are because of the increasing precipitation which may diminish the human impact to some extent although the trend of twsa shows consistent results among different products the magnitude of twsa shows relative large range thus the ensemble mean of grace products are used in the actual et estimates to reduce the uncertainty of twsc 3 3 human induced et change fig 7 shows the multi year average human induced et mm year based on the discrepancies between natural et from era5 era5 l and gldasv2 1 clsm gldasv2 1 noah gldasv2 2 and vic and grace based actual et across the seven basins the model and reanalysis et are considered to be natural et without considering human influence here the et from the reanalysis products is multiplied by the ratios of reanalysis precipitation products to the observed precipitation to remove bias from precipitation forcing except gldasv2 2 because it did not provide precipitation data with more human interventions of the terrestrial water cycle et is enhanced by irrigation and water loss from reservoir water surface the identified human induced et varies greatly for different reanalysis data which reflects the great uncertainty of the reanalysis data due to lack of natural hydrological data for model calibration the water consumption from the water resources bulletins are used as the reference to the human induced et the multi year average of water consumption is 31 mm year 80 mm year 53 mm year 113 mm year 46 mm year 73 mm year and 68 mm year for the songliao hai yellow huai yangtze southeast pearl river basins we only select the models in which the rmse of simulated runoff is less than 30 of the multi year average of the naturalized runoff and drop the models with negative human induced et for the songliao yangtze and pearl river basins the vic simulated runoff is more consistent with the naturalized runoff than that from the reanalysis fig 5a 5e 5g therefore we only use et from vic as the natural et in these three river basins for the hai river basin era5 era5 land and gldasv2 1 noah have better runoff simulations fig 5b but the human induced et estimated by era5 is close to zero fig 7b so the ensemble mean et from era5 land and gldasv2 1 noah is used to represent natural et over the hai river basin for the yellow river basin runoff simulations from era5 gldasv2 1 clsm gldasv2 1 noah and vic are better than others fig 5c so the ensemble mean et from these products is used to represent natural et for the huai river basin the ensemble mean et of gldasv2 1 clsm and gldasv2 1 noah is used as natural et because their runoff simulations are better than others fig 5d for the southeast river basin the ensemble mean et of gldasv2 2 and vic is used as natural et because of better runoff simulations fig 5f the selected model and reanalysis data for each river basin are listed in table 1 based on the selected natural et products the human influenced et changes were 50 mm year 11 46 mm year 8 38 mm year 8 50 mm year 7 41 mm year 8 100 mm year 13 and 57 mm year 8 over over songliao hai yellow huai yangtze southeast and pearl river basins respectively the results of human induced et change and water consumption data in the water resource bulletin are similar except for the huai river basin fig 8 shows the natural et actual et and human induced et change during 2003 2019 it is found that in the songliao and southeast basins there are significant increasing trends of human induced et change with an increase rate of 6 and 9 mm year which is consistent with statistics from the water consumption due to the high uncertainty of grace twsc actual et may be underestimated in some basins leading to the unsignificant change of human induced et change multi source reanalysis data did not provide satisfactory results for the detection of human influence on et in seven river basins previous studies believe that the uncertainty of grace twsc may be the main reason for the failure to detect human influence on et in this study we found that lsm simulation of natural et also has large errors when natural et is overestimated human influenced et changes cannot be detected 3 4 detection of evaporation change from reservoir surface fig 9 shows time series of annual reservoir area and reservoir evaporation during 2003 2019 overall there are increasing trends for reservoir water surface area except for the huai river basin where the reservoir area decreases at a rate of 7 9 km2 per year the trends of reservoir surface water area over the northern river basins including songliao hai yellow river basins are larger than that of the southern basins in the hai and yellow river basins the reservoir area increases significantly at a rate of 7 97 km2 and 9 3 km2 per year in the songliao hai yellow huai yangtze southeast and pearl river basins the reservoir evaporation is 1 mm year 2 mm year 2 mm year 8 mm year 2 mm year 6 mm year 3 mm year during 2003 2019 and the ratio is up to 18 of the human induced et change for the huai river basin the reservoir evaporation also shows increasing trends over the songliao hai and yellow river basins 4 conclusions and discussion based on multi source data analysis from 2003 to 2019 this study examined human induced et in the east asian monsoon region the performance of each land surface model for natural runoff was verified by using the naturalized runoff data except for hai and huai river basins the vic model is better than reanalysis data era5 era5 land gldasv2 1 and gldasv2 2 in terms of the simulations of natural runoff using the natural et generated by the selected model simulation and the actual et obtained by grace twsc we quantified the human induced et in seven basins over the east asian monsoon region the results show that the human induced et in songliao hai yellow huai yangtze southeast and pearl river basins are 50 mm year 46 mm year 38 mm year 50 mm year 41 mm year 100 mm year 57 mm year in the northern basins human may affect et through irrigation liu et al 2020 lv et al 2019a lv et al 2021 pan et al 2017 zou et al 2017 in the southern basins besides irrigation the increase of vegetation greenness may also be responsible for the increase of et bai et al 2019 bai et al 2020 as compared with the average annual water consumption data from water resources bulletins the relative contributions are 61 43 28 56 11 37 and 16 respectively our study highlights the importance of properly simulating natural hydrological processes when separating human influence the simulation performance of reanalysis data may not be satisfactory due to limited observed values and global parameterization error modeling of natural hydrological processes should also be emphasized when detecting the effects of human factors on the hydrological cycle this paper uses multisource datasets to quantify the human influence on et over the east asian monsoon river basins the performance of natural hydrological cycle simulations directly affects the estimation of human induced et changes considering the large range of natural et estimations which is consistent with zhang and yuan 2020 here we selected the naturalized runoff from water resources bulletins to constrain the natural et estimations from the water balance perspective therefore it is necessary for the model to verify the natural hydrological processes in details to accurately estimate the human induced et change besides due to the large uncertainty of et estimations at seasonal scales pan et al 2017 we only focused on the detection of human influence of et at annual scales more information from other sources of remote sensing products e g high resolution images of land cover and surface water is needed to explore et variations during growing seasons where irrigation is concentrated assimilating multisource satellite information into a high resolution land surface model with human component and incorporating artificial intelligence techniques are promising ways to detect human influences on et lastly the spatial heterogeneity of human induced et change is not considered in this study because actual et is only obtained over watershed scales using basin averaged precipitation twsa and the observed streamflow at the outlet although we estimated the reservoir evaporation losses using remote sensing approach it is only estimated for large reservoirs the impact of small and medium sized reservoirs lakes and small ponds on et is ignored zhan et al 2019 therefore different contributions of human activities should be distinguished at finer temporal and spatial resolution in the future by integrating remote sensing high resolution land surface model and artificial intelligence techniques credit authorship contribution statement huatong liu formal analysis investigation data curation writing original draft xing yuan conceptualization methodology writing review

administration cma the observed runoff and interbasin water transfer datasets are catchment accumulations from water resources bulletins for seven river basins precipitation and twsa are averaged over each basin to calculate et at river basin scale besides the naturalized runoff is also provided by water resource bulletins for each river basin which is calculated as the sum of the observed runoff and human water uses for agricultural irrigation domestic water supplies industry and reservoir regulation here the naturalized runoff is used to validate the performance of land surface models in simulating natural hydrological processes the launch of grace satellite in march 2002 provided a new method for accessing the tws information its successor grace follow on grace fo started in may 2018 to continue to provide the observation of the tws variations the terrestrial water storage anomaly twsa products were obtained from the center of space research of the university of texas at austin csr save and himanshu 2020 save et al 2016 the jet propulsion laboratory of the california institute of technology jpl landerer et al 2020 and the german research centre for geosciences gfz boergens et al 2019 here we used the latest sixth generation products rl06 from three institutions including rl06 csr and rl06 jpl using mascon solution and rl06 gfz using spherical harmonic solution sh to fill the missing values of grace and grace fo twsa during july 2017 may 2018 we first linearly interpolated the detrended time series of twsa after removing the seasonality and then added the trends and seasonality back the annual twsc was calculated by the difference between twsa in december in the target year and the year before the ensemble mean of twsc from csr jpl and gfz is used to reduce the uncertainty of grace products sakumura et al 2014 the twsc provided by grace includes both the natural and human variations the uncertainty of the annual twsc was mainly derived from the uncertainties of the two december twsa which was not accumulated from month to month here we chose the uncertainty of jpl mascon solution to represent the grace twsa uncertainty the uncertainties of each grid point are independent of each other so the regional mean uncertainty is obtained by the arithmetic average of the grid uncertainties 2 2 2 natural et from global reanalysis and vic land surface model natural et is the et estimation regardless of human activities including irrigation reservoir regulation and water diversion etc the natural et estimations from various global reanalysis products including era5 hersbach et al 2019 era5 land muñoz sabater 2019 gldasv2 1 and gldasv2 2 houser et al 2001 as well as those from the calibrated variable infiltration capacity vic model simulations were used in this study era5 and era5 land are the fifth generations of ecmwf global climate reanalysis data the spatial resolution of era5 is 0 25 and the temporal resolution of era5 is 1 h compared with era5 era5 land has a higher spatial resolution of 0 1degree gldasv2 1 consists of three models noah vic and catchment land surface model we used 1 degree monthly mean precipitation runoff and evapotranspiration from the three models above gldasv2 2 uses clsm f2 5 model operates under the forcing of meteorological analysis field of ecmwf comprehensive prediction system and assimilates data with grace because the data protocol with ecmwf gldasv2 2 does not provide meteorological forcing field here the runoff from the reanalysis products is multiplied by the ratios of reanalysis precipitation products to the observed precipitation to remove bias from precipitation forcing except for gldasv2 2 because of the absence of precipitation data we also simulated the natural et using vic from 2003 to 2019 vic is a conceptual semi distributed and grid based land surface hydrological model based on water and heat balance and physical dynamic mechanism the input data required for the vic model includes rainfall 10 m wind speed maximum and minimum surface air temperature soil data and vegetation data the vic model can output surface runoff baseflow evapotranspiration soil moisture etc yuan et al 2016 precipitation surface temperature and 10 m wind speed from cmfd and cma are used as meteorological forcing data to drive the vic model we used the parameters calibrated by zhang and yuan 2020 over the yellow river basin and the parameters calibrated by xie et al 2007 over the remaining six river basins the runoff from global reanalysis and vic model were compared against the naturalized runoff from the water resources bulletins to validate the performance of simulating natural hydrological processes to reduce the uncertainty from precipitation forcing we corrected the runoff and et data from the above global reanalysis on the basin scale by the ratio of cmfd cma precipitation observation to the precipitation from reanalysis products we calculate the standard deviation of the screened model and consider it as the uncertainty of the model if there is only one model after screening the uncertainty will not be calculated 2 2 3 reservoir evaporation there are 747 reservoirs over the study region including 68 reservoirs in the songliao river basin 40 reservoirs in the hai river basin 48 reservoirs in the yellow river basin 43 reservoirs in the huai river basin 367 reservoirs in the yangtze river basin 87 reservoirs in the southeast river basin and 94 reservoirs in the pearl river basin combined with the reservoir and dam information from the global reservoir dam database grand lehner et al 2011 a high quality global reservoir area time series data set grsad was generated which contained the monthly reservoir area series of 6817 global reservoirs from 1984 to 2015 zhao and gao 2018 the evaporation rate of reservoir surface was calculated by open water penman monteith potential evapotranspiration pet formula 2 pet δ δ γ r n g γ δ γ 6 43 1 0 536 u e s e a l v in which rn and g are net radiation at the surface and heat flux into the subsurface u is wind speed at 2 m height lv is latent heat es and ea are the saturated and actual vapor pressure δ is the slope of the vapor pressure curve and γ is the psychrometric constant the reservoir induced et change is considered as part of human induced et change in this study human induced et change is the difference between natural and observed et fig 2 3 δ e t e t o b s e t n a t where δet is considered to be the change of et caused by human activities such as reservoir regulation irrigation and land use land cover change et obs is the actual et estimate and et nat is the natural et estimated by lsms 3 results and discussion 3 1 evaluation of global reanalysis data precipitation is the most important input data of lsms and the accuracy of precipitation data determines the performance of runoff and et simulations liu et al 2016 nearing et al 2016 we compared precipitation from global reanalysis data with in situ precipitation observations at annual scale fig 3 the root means square errors are 33 255 mm year for the reanalysis data overall the precipitation from era5 and gldasv2 1 are larger than the observed precipitation with positive biases except for era5 over huai and southeast river basins the correlation coefficients range from 0 57 to 0 96 over different river basins the precipitation of gldasv2 1 was better than that of era5 over the hai yellow yangtze and pearl river basins in terms of rmse therefore it is necessary to reduce the error of precipitation to obtain more accurate estimations for natural hydrological variables fig 4 shows the naturalized and observed annual mean runoff from water resources bulletins for each river basin the naturalized runoff is used to verify the performances of simulated natural hydrological processes from global reanalysis and vic the observed runoff is smaller than the naturalized runoff due to human water abstraction for agriculture industry and domestic water supplies agricultural water use accounts for 52 74 of the total water use during 2003 2019 and the fraction of agricultural water use is most for the yellow river basin the decreases of runoff caused by human activity are 29 73 mm year which is 7 68 of naturalized runoff at the seven river basins the human influences on runoff are 23 68 62 and 30 over the songliao hai yellow and huai river basins which are higher than those over the yangtze river southeast river and pearl river basins where the water resources are more sufficient fig 5 shows the rmse and biases of basin averaged runoff from global reanalysis and vic and naturalized runoff from the water resources bulletins here the runoff from the reanalysis products is multiplied by the ratios of reanalysis precipitation products to the observed precipitation to remove bias from precipitation forcing except for gldasv2 2 because of the absence of precipitation data over the east asian monsoon river basins the basin averaged runoff from vic has relatively lower rmse and absolute bias than that of reanalysis data except for the hai and huai river basins except for the yellow river basin the parameters of vic were calibrated against observed runoff from 1980 to 2001 xie et al 2007 as the hai and huai river basins are strongly affected by human activities the calibrated vic may not represent the natural hydrological processes resulted in poor performance the yellow river is also heavily influenced by human but the naturalized runoff instead of observed runoff is used to calibrate the vic model zhang and yuan 2020 so the results are reasonable era5 era5 land gldas2 1 clsm gldas2 1 noah significantly underestimated runoff in the songliao yangtze southeast and pearl river basins here we assume if the models cannot simulate natural runoff reasonably they cannot well simulate natural et either we regard the et simulated by the model with good natural runoff simulation as the natural et gldas2 1 vic significantly overestimated the runoff over all basins which was removed in the following analysis in the songliao yangtze and pearl river basins the reanalysis data have poorer simulations of natural runoff than the vic simulated runoff so we only use the simulated et of vic as the natural et in the above mentioned basins 3 2 twsa from grace fig 6 shows the annual twsa of grace products retrieved by csr gfz and jpl the variations of twsa are influenced by the supply of precipitation the loss of surface water due to et and water abstractions the twsa shows significant declining trends over the hai yellow huai river basins during 2003 2019 especially for the hai river basin the trend of twsa over the hai river basin is 17 mm year which is mainly related to groundwater exploitation long et al 2020 and the declining trend of precipitation although there is an increasing trend of precipitation over the yellow river basin the twsa decreases for the southern river basins fig 6e g there are increasing trends of twsa p 0 01 which are possibly related to the increases in precipitation the increasing water storage over the yangtze southeast and pearl river basins are because of the increasing precipitation which may diminish the human impact to some extent although the trend of twsa shows consistent results among different products the magnitude of twsa shows relative large range thus the ensemble mean of grace products are used in the actual et estimates to reduce the uncertainty of twsc 3 3 human induced et change fig 7 shows the multi year average human induced et mm year based on the discrepancies between natural et from era5 era5 l and gldasv2 1 clsm gldasv2 1 noah gldasv2 2 and vic and grace based actual et across the seven basins the model and reanalysis et are considered to be natural et without considering human influence here the et from the reanalysis products is multiplied by the ratios of reanalysis precipitation products to the observed precipitation to remove bias from precipitation forcing except gldasv2 2 because it did not provide precipitation data with more human interventions of the terrestrial water cycle et is enhanced by irrigation and water loss from reservoir water surface the identified human induced et varies greatly for different reanalysis data which reflects the great uncertainty of the reanalysis data due to lack of natural hydrological data for model calibration the water consumption from the water resources bulletins are used as the reference to the human induced et the multi year average of water consumption is 31 mm year 80 mm year 53 mm year 113 mm year 46 mm year 73 mm year and 68 mm year for the songliao hai yellow huai yangtze southeast pearl river basins we only select the models in which the rmse of simulated runoff is less than 30 of the multi year average of the naturalized runoff and drop the models with negative human induced et for the songliao yangtze and pearl river basins the vic simulated runoff is more consistent with the naturalized runoff than that from the reanalysis fig 5a 5e 5g therefore we only use et from vic as the natural et in these three river basins for the hai river basin era5 era5 land and gldasv2 1 noah have better runoff simulations fig 5b but the human induced et estimated by era5 is close to zero fig 7b so the ensemble mean et from era5 land and gldasv2 1 noah is used to represent natural et over the hai river basin for the yellow river basin runoff simulations from era5 gldasv2 1 clsm gldasv2 1 noah and vic are better than others fig 5c so the ensemble mean et from these products is used to represent natural et for the huai river basin the ensemble mean et of gldasv2 1 clsm and gldasv2 1 noah is used as natural et because their runoff simulations are better than others fig 5d for the southeast river basin the ensemble mean et of gldasv2 2 and vic is used as natural et because of better runoff simulations fig 5f the selected model and reanalysis data for each river basin are listed in table 1 based on the selected natural et products the human influenced et changes were 50 mm year 11 46 mm year 8 38 mm year 8 50 mm year 7 41 mm year 8 100 mm year 13 and 57 mm year 8 over over songliao hai yellow huai yangtze southeast and pearl river basins respectively the results of human induced et change and water consumption data in the water resource bulletin are similar except for the huai river basin fig 8 shows the natural et actual et and human induced et change during 2003 2019 it is found that in the songliao and southeast basins there are significant increasing trends of human induced et change with an increase rate of 6 and 9 mm year which is consistent with statistics from the water consumption due to the high uncertainty of grace twsc actual et may be underestimated in some basins leading to the unsignificant change of human induced et change multi source reanalysis data did not provide satisfactory results for the detection of human influence on et in seven river basins previous studies believe that the uncertainty of grace twsc may be the main reason for the failure to detect human influence on et in this study we found that lsm simulation of natural et also has large errors when natural et is overestimated human influenced et changes cannot be detected 3 4 detection of evaporation change from reservoir surface fig 9 shows time series of annual reservoir area and reservoir evaporation during 2003 2019 overall there are increasing trends for reservoir water surface area except for the huai river basin where the reservoir area decreases at a rate of 7 9 km2 per year the trends of reservoir surface water area over the northern river basins including songliao hai yellow river basins are larger than that of the southern basins in the hai and yellow river basins the reservoir area increases significantly at a rate of 7 97 km2 and 9 3 km2 per year in the songliao hai yellow huai yangtze southeast and pearl river basins the reservoir evaporation is 1 mm year 2 mm year 2 mm year 8 mm year 2 mm year 6 mm year 3 mm year during 2003 2019 and the ratio is up to 18 of the human induced et change for the huai river basin the reservoir evaporation also shows increasing trends over the songliao hai and yellow river basins 4 conclusions and discussion based on multi source data analysis from 2003 to 2019 this study examined human induced et in the east asian monsoon region the performance of each land surface model for natural runoff was verified by using the naturalized runoff data except for hai and huai river basins the vic model is better than reanalysis data era5 era5 land gldasv2 1 and gldasv2 2 in terms of the simulations of natural runoff using the natural et generated by the selected model simulation and the actual et obtained by grace twsc we quantified the human induced et in seven basins over the east asian monsoon region the results show that the human induced et in songliao hai yellow huai yangtze southeast and pearl river basins are 50 mm year 46 mm year 38 mm year 50 mm year 41 mm year 100 mm year 57 mm year in the northern basins human may affect et through irrigation liu et al 2020 lv et al 2019a lv et al 2021 pan et al 2017 zou et al 2017 in the southern basins besides irrigation the increase of vegetation greenness may also be responsible for the increase of et bai et al 2019 bai et al 2020 as compared with the average annual water consumption data from water resources bulletins the relative contributions are 61 43 28 56 11 37 and 16 respectively our study highlights the importance of properly simulating natural hydrological processes when separating human influence the simulation performance of reanalysis data may not be satisfactory due to limited observed values and global parameterization error modeling of natural hydrological processes should also be emphasized when detecting the effects of human factors on the hydrological cycle this paper uses multisource datasets to quantify the human influence on et over the east asian monsoon river basins the performance of natural hydrological cycle simulations directly affects the estimation of human induced et changes considering the large range of natural et estimations which is consistent with zhang and yuan 2020 here we selected the naturalized runoff from water resources bulletins to constrain the natural et estimations from the water balance perspective therefore it is necessary for the model to verify the natural hydrological processes in details to accurately estimate the human induced et change besides due to the large uncertainty of et estimations at seasonal scales pan et al 2017 we only focused on the detection of human influence of et at annual scales more information from other sources of remote sensing products e g high resolution images of land cover and surface water is needed to explore et variations during growing seasons where irrigation is concentrated assimilating multisource satellite information into a high resolution land surface model with human component and incorporating artificial intelligence techniques are promising ways to detect human influences on et lastly the spatial heterogeneity of human induced et change is not considered in this study because actual et is only obtained over watershed scales using basin averaged precipitation twsa and the observed streamflow at the outlet although we estimated the reservoir evaporation losses using remote sensing approach it is only estimated for large reservoirs the impact of small and medium sized reservoirs lakes and small ponds on et is ignored zhan et al 2019 therefore different contributions of human activities should be distinguished at finer temporal and spatial resolution in the future by integrating remote sensing high resolution land surface model and artificial intelligence techniques credit authorship contribution statement huatong liu formal analysis investigation data curation writing original draft xing yuan conceptualization methodology writing review

3726,a conceptual runoff model mathematically expresses hydrological phenomena originating from spatial and temporal changes based on physical laws thus it can describe causal relationships for runoff changes however these models are difficult to run owing to their complex structures and the need for a large amount of data the development of runoff models using deep neural networks dnn which belong to the category of empirical models is continuously increasing owing to the advantages of dnn such as the modeling convenience and high prediction performance however dnn based runoff models have difficulty reflecting topographical and spatial characteristics such as land cover and physical soil characteristics because they mainly depend on meteorological data the objective of the present study was to overcome the limitation of data use that depends on meteorological data and to reflect topographical characteristics in dnn based runoff models by suggesting a data creation methodology that reflects spatial characteristics this paper proposes a methodology for producing two types of two dimensional features surface flow features sff and base flow features bff using the soil conservation service curve number and groundwater level to determine the applicability of the features the daily runoff was simulated using the generated features as input data of the convolutional neural network cnn which is a type of dnn the cnn architecture was improved to have a multi input structure and derive continuous variables because the ordinary cnn was difficult to apply in this study after the cnn was trained the daily runoff was simulated and the applicability of the features as input data of the dnn was evaluated the daily runoff predictions of the cnn using the sff and bff exhibited moderate levels this indicates that the sff and bff have sufficient value as input data of the cnn keywords surface flow feature base flow feature curve number convolution neural network daily runoff 1 introduction the global demand for water is growing rapidly with the development of industries and cultures and detailed water resource management planning is needed to cope with changing rainfall patterns such as local torrential rainfall and droughts in particular in south korea the bulk of the rainfall received by the country tends to be concentrated between june and september with the recent changes in the rainfall pattern there have been frequent events of localized torrential rainfall in which the maximum daily rainfall amounts to 25 of the annual rainfall leading to a continuous increase in the damage in addition the country has been implementing total monthly daily loads based management of water pollution and due to the change in the daily rainfall patterns during the rainy season there have been cases of exceeding the allowable maximum pollution loads since these cases of exceeding the allowable pollution loads result in imposing of penalties in regional development for local governments the changing rainfall patterns cause difficulties in management of water pollution for this reason there has been an increasing emphasis on the importance of fast prediction of daily flow according to various rainfall patterns in south korea thus the importance of runoff prediction based on various rainfall patterns is increasing and the development and utilization of a runoff model can be proposed as a method for predicting runoff runoff models are effective scientifically for water resource management and water use planning othman and naseri 2011 and can help establish policies in the field of water resource utilization singh et al 2013 runoff models can be largely classified into conceptual and empirical models conceptual models mathematically express complex hydrological phenomena maier et al 2010 caused by spatial and temporal changes according to physical laws nourani et al 2012 some examples include the clark hydrograph clark 1945 nash model nash 1957 laurenson model laurenson 1964 stream synthesis and reservoir regulation model rockwood 1964 and hydrologic engineering center river analysis storm water management model rossman 2010 and system usace 2016 conceptual models have been extensively used in runoff predictions of rivers arnold and fohrer 2005 brunner and simmons 2012 wagener et al 2001 however some operational parts of these models are complex in general conceptual models approximate the model derived value to the measured value through parameter adjustment and sensitivity analysis tokar and markus 2000 beven and freer 2001 however it is not easy to reproduce complex hydrological phenomena caused by various spatial and temporal changes as well as the rainfall patterns and physical factors of watersheds via parameter adjustment and sensitivity analysis in particular parameter adjustment requires a high level of hydrological expertise because the user must have accurate knowledge about the characteristics and meaning of each parameter thus the operation of conceptual models is highly limited and it is challenging for frontline government agencies that must establish water management plans to make intuitive decisions kratzert et al 2018 yaseen et al 2019a moreover a conceptual model requires numerous input data as well as testing and calibration procedures which are cumbersome owing to these characteristics the calibration of suitable parameters is being actively researched and is becoming a research trend duan et al 1992 cheng et al 2002 chen et al 2016 additionally because a conceptual model must express complex natural phenomena as a set of equations it is not easy to numerically represent the relationship between rainfall and runoff for a specific watershed and this requires the collection of numerous data maier et al 2010 an empirical model can be employed as a decision making process to reach a reasonable conclusion based on collected data in contrast to a conceptual model it is developed using a stable relationship between input and output values and without using a physical law patel and joshi 2017 an empirical model can be more efficient than a conceptual model for a site with a lack of experts in water resource management planning because it is easier to develop and operate many researchers have developed runoff models using artificial neural networks ann which express nonlinear structures well and have reported that they can yield better results than conceptual models mishra and karmakar 2019 shoaib et al 2016 farias et al 2013 zhang and govindaraju 2000 huo et al 2017 ann that belong to the category of empirical models have evolved into deep neural networks dnn which are being researched for many applications including voice recognition chen et al 2018 ekins 2016 natural language processing young et al 2018 collobert and weston 2008 and image classification chan et al 2015 perez and wang 2017 with studies reporting their high efficiency ann have attracted interest from many hydrologists as they have been applied to hydrological predictions based on the electric signal mechanisms of the brain and nervous system since the 1990s wang et al 2009 luger 2005 terzi and ergin 2014 valipour et al 2012 among the studies related to this topic minns and hall 1996 developed a runoff model using an ann and reported that the model accuracy increased with the number of hidden layers and that additional computational effort for analyzing the typical nonlinear behaviors of rainfall and runoff is not justified in many watersheds senthil kumar et al 2005 compared the performance of the multilayer perceptron mlp and radial basis function which is an ann method to reconsider the perception that the ann has a higher performance than the mlp in hydrology they reported that the method should be selected according to the purpose as both methods have their own advantages and disadvantages asadi et al 2013 proposed a hybrid ann combining the conventional ann with data preprocessing a genetic algorithm and the levenberg marquardt algorithm and they reported an accuracy higher than those of the general ann and neuro fuzzy inference system in these studies on runoff models using ann the model performance was enhanced through repeated improvements recently with the development of dnn with a higher performance than that of ann the research on runoff models is naturally moving toward dnn hu et al 2018 pointed out that the previous research on runoff modeling using ann seldom involved time series predictions and they developed a rainfall runoff model using time series data with long short term memory lstm which is a type of dnn they reported that the lstm exhibited higher performance than the conventional ann kratzert et al 2019 proposed entity aware lstm ea lstm which is an improved version of lstm and found that it is suitable for rainfall runoff modeling compared to a conceptual model although the runoff pattern is significantly influenced by the rainfall pattern runoffs are manifested in various forms by the topographical conditions of the watershed such as the physical characteristics of the land cover and soil sajikumar and remya 2015 ogden et al 2013 in many previous studies involving dnn researchers mainly used meteorological data such as the rainfall evapotranspiration temperature dew point humidity atmospheric pressure and wind speed as input for model development kratzert et al 2021 liu et al 2021 xiang and demir 2020 zhang et al 2021 studies where input data were used to reflect topographical conditions are rare the reason why the input data of the dnn are limited to meteorological data is the structure of the dnn in general the data input to a dnn have a one dimensional 1d vector format thus it is difficult for the dnn to handle spatial characteristics such as topographical conditions however the convolutional neural network cnn proposed by lecun et al 1998 can learn spatial characteristics and is used for image classification speech recognition and image segmentation alireza et al 2015 taravat et al 2015 it has rapidly become a core technology in the image classification field owing to advantages such as the derivation of reliable results and a high efficiency cnn is also used in hydrology van et al 2020 developed a runoff model using a cnn they designed the cnn architecture to use 1d input data and simulate runoff according to rainfall and the results were slightly better than those obtained using lstm consequently the authors concluded that cnn is appropriate for regression problems miao et al 2019 proposed a model that combined a cnn and lstm and presented improved results for prediction of precipitation than a general cnn model li et al 2018 suggested cnn based convolutional deep belief networks cdbn and simulated runoff they reported that the cdbn accurately represented the nonlinearity of the runoff and had an excellent runoff prediction ability although many of the previous studies described above have actively utilized the latest dnn technique in the field of hydrology most of the data used in these studies are limited to vector type meteorological data making it impossible to reflect the topographical characteristics or effect of spatial characteristics of the watershed on the runoff in particular for this reason it is difficult to apply flow simulation using the latest dnn technology in watersheds of south korea since more than 70 of the country s terrain is covered by forests in addition the effect of changes in the land use cannot be reflected which may cause difficulties in the interpretation of flow simulation results this study presents a novel intuitive data creation methodology that reflects spatial characteristics to overcome the limitations of data used in the conventional dnn models in addition in order to evaluate the applicability of the data the created data are used as input data of cnn which has excellent performances in learning spatial characteristics to perform daily runoff simulation in this way the present study proposes a new methodology of runoff simulation that allows fast simulation of daily runoff taking into account the topographical conditions the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the study area and materials section 3 describes the data creation methodology reflecting spatial characteristics and the improved cnn architecture section 4 presents the results of applying cnn to the constructed data section 5 discusses the applicability of the data finally section 6 presents conclusions and suggests future works 2 study area data and tools 2 1 study area the jojong watershed which is close to the capital area of south korea was selected as the study area as shown in fig 1 it is one of the watersheds surrounding paldang lake a major water resource of the capital area of south korea located approximately 27 3 km from seoul the capital of south korea paldang lake supplies water to approximately 50 of the total population of south korea to secure stable water resources from paldang lake the south korean government is applying strict regulations to the watersheds surrounding lake the jojong watershed is also subject to strict regulations for water quality preservation and there has been little change in land cover for nearly three decades that is the watershed in this study is characterized by the fact that the data of rainfall runoff and groundwater level were not affected by changes in land use which indicates that the flow variations with respect to changes in land use do not need to be reflected in the analysis of this study in particular there is an advantage that the application of land cover status that has had little change over a long study period facilitates easier process in conducting the study therefore the watershed was considered to be appropriate for the purpose of this study and set as the study area the jojong river is the main river in the jojong watershed e 127 25 08 08 n 37 43 41 72 with a length of approximately 39 km and the watershed area of 260 6 km2 owing to the effect of the aforementioned regulations the jojong watershed is mostly composed of forests 79 6 other land covers consist of pasture 7 4 upland 5 2 urban 2 2 and paddy 1 7 table 1 2 2 study data five data items were required for data creation in this study rainfall runoff groundwater level land cover map and soil map in this study it was difficult to perform direct measurement of the study data due to limitations of human resources and budget so data provided online by the government of the republic of korea were used the rainfall data were collected from the korea meteorological administration kma 0000 the runoff and soil map were obtained from the water resources management information system wamis 0000 the groundwater level data were collected from the national groundwater information center ngic 0000 and the land cover map was obtained from the environmental geographic information service egis 0000 here the groundwater level data was provided only up to 2018 at the time of data collection so the data collection period was limited to the end of 2018 for this reason the study period was set from january 1 2010 to december 31 2018 the observed points for rainfall runoff and groundwater level are shown in fig 1 the rainfall data consist of daily data mm d 1 from nine rain stations the runoff data include daily average data m3 s 1 d 1 at the end of the study in the watershed and the groundwater levels represent daily average data el m d 1 of seven groundwater level stations the land cover map is composed of eight land covers water urban barren pasture forest paddy upland and wetland the soil map contains the physical properties of 59 soils table 2 2 3 study tools this study was conducted on a windows os based desktop computer with an intel core i9 9900 k central processing unit cpu 3 60 ghz 32g random access memory ram and an ndivia geforce rtx 2080ti graphics processing unit gpu python 2020 was used for data creation and keras 2020 was used for the design implementation and operation of the cnn model keras uses tensorflow tensorflow 2020 a machine learning library released by google as a backend all the special features of tensorflow are supported by the high level dnn application programming interface created using python and keras has a high flexibility in dnn model implementation furthermore keras allows fast experimentation because it can efficiently use the cpu and gpu 3 methodology the methodology of this study can be summarized as follows 1 present a data creation method reflecting the topographical and rainfall conditions and create data 2 use the created data as the training data for the cnn and perform a daily runoff simulation 3 evaluate the applicability of the data through the simulation results this methodology uses the two dimensional 2d matrix structure instead of the 1d vector format as the data format because the data must reflect spatial characteristics this is also the reason why a cnn is used in this study cnn is one of the dnn algorithms that uses a feed forward network to extract topological features from images in addition there are models derived from cnn such as region based cnn yang et al 2017 fast r cnn girshick 2015 and faster r cnn kim et al 2018 there is also an algorithm named you only look once yolo redmon et al 2016 with which you only look once at an image to predict what objects are present and where the objects are among these different algorithms in this study the cnn algorithm was selected this is to prevent the proposed data creation methodology from being affected by another improved algorithm in hydrology the runoff in a river when rainfall occurs is theoretically defined as the sum of the surface flow and base flow and when there is no rain only the base flow occurs the data creation methodology of this study is based on the aforementioned theoretical background and can be summarized as creating two types of features to consider the conditions with and without rainfall when constructing the input data of the cnn the use of red green and blue rgb images such as photographs which are used in the conventional cnn can be suggested however using rgb images in an empirical model for hydrological research can compromise the fundamental premise of the empirical model even if excellent results are obtained using general rgb images the value of each pixel comprising rgb images expresses colors in the range of 0 255 which are meaningless because they cannot explain the causal relationship between rainfall and runoff in order to address these limitations satellite images can be used many of the previous studies have already reported the application of satellite images to neural network models with satellite images since the reflection of light is divided by wavelength band additional preprocessing is necessary to consider the land use or meteorological conditions also since there is a large number of wavelengths it is not practically easy to find satellite images suitable for the model thus to maintain the premise of the empirical model this paper proposes a methodology for creating surface flow features sff and base flow features bff reflecting spatial changes according to the wet and dry conditions the proposed methodology for creating sff and bff can resolve the above mentioned drawbacks of satellite images and has the advantage of the easy and simple construction of data for cnn models the tiff file format was used for the features because if the features newly created by the proposed method are saved in jpg bmp or png format they are transformed into color values in the range of 0 255 resulting in information loss to utilize sff and bff a cnn a type of dnn was used in this study a general cnn was designed to perform binary or category classification for images input through a single input path however this cnn architecture required improvement because it was unsuitable for the use of two types of images in this study thus the cnn architecture was improved to comprise two input paths and allow the simulation of continuous daily runoff by extracting the spatial characteristics of each feature 3 1 sff 3 1 1 procedure for creating sff typical photographs are composed of pixels with various colors accordingly sff were generated in the present study among the research data as mentioned above the data indicating spatial characteristics are the land cover map and soil map as shown in table 2 both these data are in raster format composed of a set of grids with different values the concept of generating sff is illustrated in fig 2 the sff is created by assigning a newly calculated value using the values of rainfall land cover and soil map to each grid the grids red dotted lines in fig 2 could complicate the understanding of the grid calculation process because they are expressed larger than the actual size used in this study the grids were actually calculated one by one 3 1 2 rainfall feature thiessen polygons schumann 1998 have been used to calculate rainfall over a broad range in hydrology however they have the generate discontinuous rainfall variations in the space because a different rainfall is estimated for each polygon webster and oliver 2001 as such when a thiessen polygon is used in this study the feature change shapes become monotonous making it unsuitable for training the cnn model as an alternative method to the thiessen polygon the application of a spatial interpolation method can be proposed the examples of using the spatial interpolation method in previous studies include the inverse distance weighted method idw miller 2004 kriging method cressie 1990 and spline method azpurua and dos ramos 2010 there are various options for each method simple kriging ordinary kriging co kriging and universal kriging for kriging method and regularized spline spline with tensor multi quadratic inverse multi quadratic and thin plate spline for the spline method on the contrary idw has the advantages of simplicity of the method and efficient implementation of spatial interpolation and does not provide additional options as in the above mentioned spatial interpolation method since the main focus of this study is the data creation methodology and its applicability it was considered not appropriate to implement multiple spatial interpolation methods and idw was thought to be most appropriate in terms of minimizing the effect of applying the spatial interpolation method therefore idw was adopted as the spatial interpolation method in this study inverse distance weighting idw a spatial interpolation method is used to decide the value of an unobserved point by assigning a weight based on the distance between the observed point and its neighboring point according to tobler s law of geography miller 2004 idw has the advantage of generating features of more various shapes than thiessen polygons because it is based on the assumption that the distance between an unobserved point and a neighboring observed point is inversely proportional to the observed value in this study to avoid the monotony of thiessen polygons rainfall features of the grid type are constructed using the rainfall data of the vector format through idw zx eq 1 1 z x i 1 n w i z x i i 1 n w i w 1 l i 2 where z x represents the estimated value of the unobserved point w i represents the weight z x represents the observed value of the neighboring point and l i represents the distance from the unobserved point to the observed point 3 1 3 calculation of grid values in a feature in fig 2 each grid is calculated using the curve number cn scs 1985 proposed by the soil conservation service scs which is the predecessor of the u s national resource conservation service ponce and hawkins 1996 pointed out the disadvantages of the cn e g sensitivity to the selection of cn lack of clear explanation about antecedent soil moisture condition amc change in cn for different biota lack of clear explanation about change in space scale and initial loss value fixed to 0 2 however various studies have been conducted using the cn and its usefulness for hydrological analysis has been continuously demonstrated chen and wang 2015 deshmukh et al 2013 ebrahimian et al 2012 mishra et al 2006 soulis and valiantzas 2012 shi et al 2009 the cn is derived using conditions such as rainfall soil characteristics and land cover it is useful for simulating direct runoff and evaluating hydrological effects li et al 2018 wang and chen 2019 additionally this study revealed that the cn can be used in sff generation considering the usefulness of the cn for hydrological analysis the cn is determined by calculating the total runoff of watersheds q eqs 2 and 3 using the rainfall p and residual water storage s eq 4 the same calculation process used for the cn is performed for sff creation as well but the q in the sff is determined for each grid instead of only one cn for an entire watershed furthermore the calculated q for each grid is set as a dimensionless value ignoring the unit 2 q p 0 2 s 2 p 0 8 s p i a i a 0 2 s 3 q 0 p i a i a 0 2 s 4 s 25400 c n 254 in eq 4 the cn plays a key role in the determination of the grid value it is assigned according to the physical characteristics and land cover conditions of four types of soils classified into hydrologic soil group hsg a b c and d the scs provides these cn values as a table but they have errors for use in south korea owing to the different topographical conditions the ministry of land infrastructure and transport of south korea mlit 2012 published modified cn in the design flood estimation techniques dfet and recommends using these cn thus in the present study the cn of the study area was derived using the land cover map and soil map provided by the dfet of the ministry of land infrastructure and transport the scs recommends the adjustment of cni cni eq 5 and cniii cniii eq 6 in consideration of antecedent rainfalls the reason for considering the antecedent rainfall is to estimate the soil saturation of the surface due to the antecedent rainfall and the change in direct runoff occurring in the surface following the saturation as conventional methods that can evaluate the direct runoff and base flow by antecedent rainfall the straight line method the n day method and the baseflow recession curve can be proposed however when using these methods they derive 1d data applicable to the entire watershed resulting in a difficulty in expanding the data into 2d type data required in sff as an alternative to the above methods antecedent rainfall proposed in soil conservation service curve number scs cn can be used in this study and this method can be sufficiently utilized for the creation of sff scs cn method considers the effect of the antecedent moisture condition amc according to the antecedent rainfall here antecedent rainfalls refer to 5 day cumulative rainfall p5 on the runoff the amc is divided into dry and wet seasons and can also be classified into three levels as amci ii and iii in the present study as suggested by the scs the grid value was calculated using the amc which is affected by the period and condition in daily units according to the climate of korea the dry and wet seasons are said to range from october to may and june to september respectively furthermore the daily amc was determined by calculating the daily p5 and the daily adjusted cn was calculated using eqs 5 and 6 table 3 5 c n i 4 2 c n i i 10 0 058 c n

bff the sff created using eqs 2 and 3 cannot represent the spatial changes under dry conditions because the q of each grid becomes zero if the rainfall is zero or smaller than the effective rainfall i a to simulate the daily runoff in this study both dry and rainy conditions must be considered however daily runoff simulation is impossible with the sff because the sff can be created in rainy conditions only thus features other than the sff which reflects the rain condition are required as an alternative the runoff from a river under dry conditions can be considered in general runoff continuously occurs in natural rivers even under dry conditions this implies that the base flow forms the river flow and the runoff under dry conditions is dependent on the ground water in fact in many previous studies it is assumed that the base flow occurs from groundwater and there have been studies that investigated groundwater budget or groundwater recharge walton 1965 o hearn and gibb 1980 mau and winter 1997 hence in this study it is assumed that the runoff change under dry conditions is based on the change in the groundwater volume and the magnitude of the base flow is indirectly determined using the groundwater level furthermore to express the spatial change in the groundwater level by features spatial interpolation is performed using the data at the point where the groundwater level is measured along with idw as shown in fig 1 this feature is a bff which is constructed as a grid feature with the same resolution as the land cover and soil maps 3 3 target and labeling for the learning method of the cnn model the supervised learning method which repeatedly decreases the error between the measured and predicted values is used in the neural network field the measured value is generally referred to as the target in this study the daily runoff collected as described in section 2 2 corresponds to the target to train the cnn the task of labeling which involves matching a feature with the target is required this study also requires a labeled dataset and the sff bff and runoff are composed as one labeled dataset here labeled indicates that the runoff was matched with the sff and bff of the same date in this study the target was constructed simply as a comma separated value csv file in contrast to the complex creation method for the sff and bff then labeling was performed so that the sff bff and runoff target would be composed as one labeled dataset with h5 as the file format the process of creating the sff and bff and constructing a dataset is described in fig 3 3 4 cnn 3 4 1 cnn architecture the cnn model was inspired by the visual processing method of animals for recognizing objects lecun et al 1998 the cnn is generally composed of a convolutional layer cl a pooling layer pl and a dense layer which is also called a fully connected layer fc the cnn can use not only the input data of the 1d vector format in the ann but also two and three dimensional data the main characteristic of the cnn is that it can learn and efficiently extract the spatial features of input data the layers that perform this are the cl and pl which are handled as a pair in the cnn architecture and this is simply referred to as a conv layer the fc has one or more dense layers between the flatten layer and output which is identical to the general dnn architecture medina et al 2017 zeiler and fergus 2014 for this study the general cnn architecture that receives one input is improved to an architecture that receives two inputs as shown in fig 4 this cnn has two conv layers each of which extracts the features of the sff and bff the structure of each conv layer was designed similarly to visual geometry group 16 vgg 16 in visual geometry group net vgg net simonyan and zisserman 2014 although there are models that can derive better results than vgg 16 such as googlenet and residual net resnet he et al 2016 the cnn architecture used in this study was designed with a similar structure to vgg 16 because vgg net achieves satisfactory performance above a certain level with a relatively simple structure furthermore the information extracted from the two conv layers must be reflected in the runoff simulation and the layer that performs this role is the concatenate layer the concatenate layer combines the spatial information extracted from each conv layer and then passes the combined information of the conv layers to the fc as input data lastly the fc derives the daily runoff using the information received from the concatenate layer typically the cnn uses a softmax or sigmoid function as the activation function of the last dense layer of the fc however this is not suitable for deriving a continuous variable such as daily runoff hence in this study the linear function which is often used in regression analysis was selected as the activation function of the last dense layer of the fc the complete structure of the fc is composed of four dense layers followed by a batch normalization layer to prevent overfitting and then a dense layer the first four dense layers were designed sequentially with 4096 8192 8192 and 8192 nodes and the last dense layer was designed with one node 3 4 2 layer configuration of cnn the cnn uses an image filter of a square matrix form called a kernel which plays the role of a parameter for finding the features of images while searching for a cl in this study the size of every kernel of the cl was set to 3 3 and the numbers of kernels were set to 32 32 64 64 128 128 256 256 512 and 512 in the order of the conv layers the stride i e the search interval of the kernels was set to 2 for the first and second cls and to 1 for the other cls for extracting the image features kernels cause a loss of image information because they reduce the image in the process of extracting the image features therefore information loss is prevented by setting padding in the cl the padding of the cnn in this study was set to same to prevent the loss of image information additionally each cl has an activation function and in this study the rectified linear unit relu eq 7 was used as the activation function the relu can generally avoid the gradient vanishing phenomenon and has a high model optimization efficiency chen and ho 2019 7 r e l u max 0 x the pl comes after the cl and plays the role of reducing the size of the information received from the cl leaving only important information this allows efficient use of the computer memory because the amount of information to calculate is reduced and overfitting can be prevented the pl can be categorized as max pooling and average pooling in this study only max pooling was used because average pooling has the risk of information loss the pooling size was set to 2 2 3 4 3 training of the cnn the cnn which uses supervised learning repeatedly reduces the error between the measured and predicted values for which it continuously improves the weighted value in the neural network in general an error in the neural network field is called a loss and the goal of supervised learning is to optimize the model by minimizing the loss the degree of learning of a model can be determined by the change in the loss which can be monitored by setting a loss function a cnn for classification generally uses binary cross entropy sparce categorical cross entropy or categorical cross entropy as a loss function however these loss functions are not suitable when simulating a continuous variable such as runoff thus in this study the mean squared error mse eq 8 which is mainly used in regression analysis was used as the loss function and it was employed to determine the training result and optimization level of the model for the prediction performance which must be examined in model training the mean absolute error mae eq 9 was used as the examination metric 8 m s e 1 n i 1 n y i y i 2 9 m a e 1 n i 1 n y i y i where y i and y i denote the measured and predicted values respectively the performance of the model is higher when the mse and mae are closer to zero even if the cnn training result based on the mse and mae is good or excellent the model must be validated for generalization to this end in the present study a cnn model was developed by dividing the dataset into a training dataset and a validation dataset the mse and mae for the training dataset are referred to as loss and mae respectively and the mse and mae for the validation dataset are referred to as val loss and val mae respectively the cnn uses various optimization methods to minimize error similar to the dnn for optimization stochastic gradient descent sgd bottou 2010 is considered as the most basic algorithm but it is highly inefficient for optimizing the model to improve this the following optimization algorithms have been developed nesterov accelerated gradient nesterov 1983 momentum qian 1999 adagrad duchi et al 2011 adadelta zeiler 2012 nadam dozat 2016 rmsprop hinton and tieleman 2014 and adam kingma and ba 2014 in this study adamax an extension of the adam algorithm was used as an algorithm based on the update rule of adam adamax which exhibits better performance in the cnn model especially adamax performs fast optimization when the data change is large and outperforms other algorithms under noisy conditions kingma and ba 2014 hence adamax was selected as the most suitable optimization algorithm for the cnn model because the runoff to be simulated has large variations according to the hydrological phenomena and the variables in the natural conditions are subject to a wide variety of noisy conditions herein the learning rate was set to 0 0001 and the number of epochs was 500 3 5 evaluation methodology 3 5 1 classical model for comparison of model performance for comparison and evaluation of the flow prediction results of the methodology proposed in this study the flow of the study area was modeled using long short term memory lstm and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis which were frequently employed in previous studies lstm hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 is one of the ann optimized for handling the static time series data such as natural language processing nlp lstm is a deep learning technique capable of addressing the vanishing gradient problem faced in the existing recurrent neural network rnn and is suitable for predicting seasonal and temporal variation of flow ni et al 2020 anfis jang 1993 is a model that combines neuro fuzzy systems nfs and artificial neural networks ann among linear time series models it has been applied to various applications in water resource management reported having excellent performance yurdusev and firat 2009 ocampo duque et al 2007 for the lstm and anfis models used in this study the basic architecture of the models was used as they are without modification and since the theoretical background for the respective models is well documented this will not be described in this study in addition for the study data for lstm and anfis models rainfall data runoff data and groundwater level data in table 2 were used 3 5 2 comparison of flow duration curve the degree of flow variations in a watershed depends on the rainfall duration rainfall intensity lag time watershed area river length and land cover as well as various other factors thus in previous studies the correlation between the rainfall and runoff was analyzed to determine the flow characteristics however this makes it difficult to identify flow variations for a specific period and examining the reaction pattern of the overall watershed is inconvenient as an alternative approach the water level survey wls and flow duration curve fdc can be used the wls in south korea classifies the water level into seven levels based on the frequency of occurrence as follows lowest water level drought water level ordinary water level abundant water level high water level flood water level and highest water level since wls classifies the flow based on various water levels it is useful in establishing detailed water resource management plans however wls has drawbacks in terms of the instability of flow variations when there is a change in the cross section of the river even when the same water level of wls is measured on the other hand fdc performs classification by direct utilization of the volume of the flow so it does not have the problem of instability as in the case of wls in addition since the volume of flow is used for classification fdc is more intuitive than wls that presents the result in terms of water levels therefore in this study the fdc method was used for classification of the flow the fdc can be used to analyze the flow variations over the entire range by probabilistically identifying the overall flow conditions dingman 2002 vogel and fenessey 1994 in addition it can represent the cumulative frequency of time series flow data for a specific period the x axis of the fdc represents the flow duration or time percentage similar to the cumulative frequency distribution and the y axis represents the daily runoff the fdc can be used to investigate the overall flow reaction pattern for the entire range of river runoff the fdc is created using the daily runoff excess ratio eq 10 which is the percentage of the number of days with a specific flow exceeding a certain level for which the daily runoff data are listed in descending order from the largest runoff to the smallest runoff the fdc divides the daily runoff excess ratio into five intervals of 10 40 60 and 90 which correspond to high flow moist condition mid range flow dry condition and low flow respectively cleland 2002 in this study the fdc of the measured values and values predicted by the cnn were plotted and compared for each section to determine whether the sff and bff can be applied as the training data for the cnn 10 d a i l y r u n o f f e x c e s s r a t i o r u n o ff r a n k n u m b er o f m e a s u r e m e n t 100 3 5 3 evaluation metrics to determine whether the proposed sff and bff can be applied as the training data for the cnn the cnn was trained using the sff and bff and the predicted and measured values were compared to determine the performance of the model three metrics were used the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse eq 11 root mean square error rmse eq 12 and mean absolute percent error mape eq 13 the nse is in the range of 0 1 a value of 1 indicates that the model result perfectly matches the measured value in particular nse enables representation of the model s performance in the range from unsatisfactory to excellent facilitating more intuitive decision on the performance of the model 11 n s e 1 i 1 n y i y i 2 i 1 n y i y 2 the rmse quantitatively indicates whether the predicted value of the model is close to the measured value and its range is from 0 to infinity within the range of the data the unit of the rmse is generally identical to the unit of the simulation object thus the unit of the rmse in this study is identical to the unit of the runoff m3 s 1 d 1 although the evaluation criteria for the rmse are not clearly defined a value closer to zero indicates that the model result is closer to the measured value that is since rmse represents the results of how reliable the prediction performance of the cnn model using sff and bff is in units of real measurement and thus was judged to be appropriate for use in this study 12 r m s e 1 n i 1 n y i y i 2 the rmse has scale dependent errors with respect to the prediction target so it is difficult to judge the performance of the model with rmse alone therefore in this study mape was used to provide complementary support in the decision of model performance in addition to rmse the mape indicates the error size as a percentage because the mape is expressed as a percentage between 0 and 100 it is easy to interpret the result however there are no clear judgment criteria for the model performance nonetheless an mape closer to zero indicates that the model has higher performance the mape is expressed as follows 13 m a p e 100 n i 1 n y i y i y i where y i and y i represent the measured and predicted values respectively and y represent the averages of the measured the study flowchart corresponding to sections 3 4 and 3 5 is shown in fig 5 this is the same as the overall flow of this study except for the step of building sff and bff 4 results 4 1 rainfall and runoff the variations of the rainfall and daily runoff during the study period are shown in fig 6 a the daily rainfall during the study period was in the range of 0 358 0 mm and the highest daily rainfall was recorded in 2011 the average rainfall during the study period was 1432 3 mm the annual cumulative rainfall was the lowest in 2014 815 4 mm and the highest in 2011 2289 2 mm the daily runoff during the study period was in the range of 0 1 774 0 m3 s 1 and the highest daily runoff was recorded in 2011 when the daily rainfall was the highest the daily runoff during the study period changed with respect to the intensity of the daily rainfall indicating that the variations of the daily runoff in the study area followed the general natural phenomena to examine the relationship between the runoff and rainfall data a scatterplot was drawn as shown in fig 6 b the coefficient of determination r2 between the runoff and rainfall was 0 558 indicating a low power explanation but the p value i e the result of the analysis of variance test was 0 001 indicating a high significance of the rainfall data hence this study determined that the runoff and rainfall data were fit for use 4 2 groundwater level the groundwater levels at seven groundwater level gauges from 2010 to 2018 are shown in fig 7 in most cases the groundwater levels were high in 2011 when the rainfall was high and low in 2014 and 2015 when the rainfall was low similar to the runoff variations shown in fig 6 a furthermore the groundwater level was higher toward the north and lower toward the south this is because the surrounding region of the study area has topographical conditions where forests with high elevation are located in the northern part and the mainstream of the river in the study area is located in the southern part thus the elevation of the terrain increases toward the north for this reason the groundwater level stations located in the northern part of the study area also have relatively higher elevation which led to the increased elevation of the aquifer toward the north by the forests the groundwater level of g5 was lower than those of g3 and g4 which have similar latitudes this could be because g5 is located near the main stream of the bukhan river in south korea the rice paddies and fields are irrigated in spring march to may which is the peak farming season and the fields are irrigated to cultivate field crops in autumn september to october the study area also has rice paddies and fields near the river and as there are no water resources other than the jojong river in the study area the groundwater level decreases because the groundwater is used for irrigation in spring and autumn when the runoff is low thus because the groundwater level varies according to the changes in rainfall in the study area it can be used to create the bff i e the input data of the cnn model 4 3 results of feature creation and setting cnn dataset during the study period 3287 sff and 3287 bff were generated fig 8 shows the daily rainfall features sff and bff from july 24 to 30 2011 among the features generated in this study each feature has 670 819 grids and each grid represents an area of 30 m 30 m fig 8 a shows the spatial variations of rainfall as the rainfall feature which increased from july 24 2011 reached the peak on july 27 2011 and then decreased consequently the amc changed from amci to amciii fig 8 b shows the spatial variations of the sff the sff did not exhibit spatial variations on july 24 and 30 when a low rainfall occurred whereas a high sff was generated on july 27 when the rainfall was the highest furthermore in contrast to the rainfall feature the sff did not exhibit smooth numerical changes even when the rainfall data are applied to eqs 2 4 the result for the sff is judged to be due to the influence of 32 cns determined by eight types of land cover and four types of hsgs in the study area nevertheless since the sff demonstrate differentiated spatial characteristics by rainfall and cn it presents the potential as relevant data for cnn learning this is attributed to the effect of the cn by the land cover and soil maps thus the sff represent various spatial variations according to the rainfall and cn conditions and the sff are appropriate for the training of the cnn which requires various features fig 8 c shows the spatial variations of the bff in contrast to the sff the bff does not exhibit immediate reactions to rainfalls the bff on july 26 when the rainfall was 200 mm was similar to the bff on july 24 when the rainfall was low furthermore the bff on july 27 was very high owing to prolonged rainfall it decreased slowly with the reduction of rainfall thereafter this suggests that the bff is affected by rainfall but has a delay this characteristic of the bff follows the hydrological theory and indicates its potential for simulating the runoff under dry conditions cnn models generally require input data with the same width and height the sff and bff created in this study have different widths and heights so images need to be interpolated as a method for interpolation pillow pillow 0000 an image module of python can be suggested pillow provides five different image interpolation methods linear lehmann et al 1999 bilinear lehmann et al 1999 hamming harris 1978 bicubic keys 1981 and lanczoc duchon 1979 methods the linear method is the simplest among the five methods and has the advantage of having the fastest image processing speed in addition hirahara et al 2020 reported that when the images processed with the five interpolation methods of pillow were applied to the cnn model and there was no significant difference in accuracy between the linear method and other methods therefore considering the image processing speed and accuracy linear interpolation was judged to be efficient and used in this study fig 8 shows the results of applying linear interpolation to sff and bff fig 9 a and b show the initially created sff and bff and fig 9 c and d show the interpolated sff and bff with the same width and height of 1024 the sff and bff in fig 9 c and d were used as the dataset of cnn with the daily runoff data i e the target data in addition 1096 data 33 3 of the total number of data were used as test data sets to evaluate the applicability of this methodology the constructed dataset was divided into an input dataset and a test dataset for training the cnn model in this study the data from 2010 to 2015 were used as the input dataset and the data from 2016 to 2018 were used as the test dataset the input dataset is divided into training and validation datasets but there is no established criterion for the ratio of these two datasets however in many previous studies 7 3 or 8 2 was used as the ratio of the training and validation datasets alsumaiei 2020 lee et al 2020 mulualem and liou 2020 in the present study the training and validation datasets had a ratio of 7 3 as shown in table 4 and were used for the cnn training 4 4 cnn training results as mentioned in section 2 3 4 the cnn training result is determined using the loss mae val loss and val mae loss and mae were used as metrics for training the model for the input dataset whereas val loss and val mae were used as metrics for generalization of the model there are no clear criteria for judging the training result in a neural network model however in general with the progress of epochs the shapes of the loss validation loss mae and validation mae curves become similar to the exponential function where the base is lower than zero when these values become close to the 0 of the y axis it is considered that the model has been sufficiently trained high performance of the model can be guaranteed if the reduction trend of the metric sufficiently and stably converges to zero additionally the magnitudes and variations of the metrics of the training dataset loss and mae and the metrics of the validation dataset val loss and val mae should be examined if the validation dataset metrics are smaller than the training dataset metrics the cnn is overfit and the model estimation results are not reliable the training results of the cnn model used in this study are shown in fig 10 regarding the metrics of the training dataset loss started with 608 0 m3 s 1 d 1 in the first epoch and decreased to 6 1 m3 s 1 d 1 in the last epoch and mae decreased from 7 3 to 1 3 m3 s 1 d 1 regarding the metrics of the validation dataset val loss started with 308 9 m3 s 1 d 1 in the first epoch and decreased to 96 8 m3 s 1 d 1 in the last epoch and val mae decreased from 7 3 to 3 7 m3 s 1 d 1 the graphs for the training dataset and validation dataset decreased together until approximately 110 epochs then their difference gradually increased and the metrics of the validation dataset appeared higher than the metrics of the training dataset in the final analysis none of the metrics of the cnn model exhibited the ideal training condition because the amplitude appeared large in all the graphs however with increasing epochs they converged close to zero and the metrics of the validation dataset appeared higher than those of the training dataset because overfitting did not occur it was determined that both the training and generalization of the model progressed sufficiently 4 5 cnn estimation results and model evaluation to evaluate the recognition and applicability of the sff and bff data in the cnn the runoff was simulated from 2016 to 2018 using the test dataset and the results are shown in fig 11 and fig 12 fig 11 shows the time series changes of the measured and predicted values the time series change of the daily runoff predicted by the cnn followed the trend of the measured values furthermore a comparison with other models was conducted to determine the level of performance of the cnn model in this study fig 12 shows the linearity and fdc between the measured values and predicted values by cnn lstm and anfis fig 12 a c and e illustrates the linearity between the measured values and the daily runoff predicted by cnn lstm and anfis and fig 12 b d and f presents fdc between the measured values and the daily runoffs predicted by cnn lstm and anfis as can be seen from fig 12 a c and e the values predicted by cnn lstm and anfis were shown to have linearity with the measured values and the higher the flow the stronger the linearity the linearity of the cnn model and the lstm was similar but it is judged that the cnn model has better linearity around 1 00 m3 s 1 day 1 on the other hand the anfis model showed weaker linearity compared to cnn and lstm the fdc was used to identify the trend of the predicted values relative to the measured values according to the magnitude of the runoff as a result of drawing the fdc on the basis of the measured fdc the runoff data were divided into five intervals of high flow 9 5 m3 s 1 d 1 moist condition 2 4 m3 s 1 d 1 mid range flow 1 5 m3 s 1 d 1 dry condition 0 8 m3 s 1 d 1 and low flow 0 8 m3 s 1 d 1 the measured fdc exhibited rapid changes in runoff in the high flow and low flow intervals and gradual changes in runoff in the moist condition mid range flow and dry condition intervals the predicted fdc also exhibited rapid changes in the high flow and low flow intervals and gradual changes in other intervals following the trend of the measured fdc although the predicted fdc approximated the measured fdc relatively stably in the high flow interval it exhibited instability in other intervals in particular the predicted fdc exhibited marked instability in the dry condition and low flow intervals this trend was also observed in lstm and anfis the predicted fdc of lstm showed slight instability in the high flow prediction compared to cnn but showed better runoff prediction results at low flow interval than cnn compared to the predicted fdc of cnn and lstm anfis showed instability in the runoff prediction performance in the entire range of fdc and showed higher instability especially in dry condition and low flow intervals through the fdc results the cnn model of this study showed better runoff prediction results than the lstm and anfis models in the entire range of fdc so it can be expected that the cnn model would show better prediction performance in the runoff prediction according to the magnitude of runoff in order to determine the applicability of sff and ffs to cnn the nse rmse and mape of cnn lstm and anfis are presented as shown in table 5 the nses of cnn lstm and anfis for the whole interval were 0 9 rmse was 2 1 2 2 and 4 3 m3 s 1 day 1 respectively and mape was 17 8 18 6 and 25 5 respectively showing that rmse and mape of cnn were lower than those of lstm and anfis in terms of the nse by intervals it was 0 7 in the dry condition interval of lstm and 0 6 and 0 5 in the dry condition and low flow intervals of anfis respectively indicating lower model efficiency compared to cnn the rmse of cnn by interval was found to be lower than the runoff range in all fdc intervals except for the low flow interval the rmse of lstm was found to be lower than the runoff range in all fdc intervals and the rmse of anfis was found to be lower than the runoff range in all the intervals except for dry condition and low flow intervals the mape of each interval of the cnn model was 10 7 14 3 15 8 21 2 and 28 5 for the respective high flow moist condition mid range flow dry condition and low flow intervals which was lower than the mape of lstm and anfis in most cases however it can be seen that the mape of the cnn model increases with the decrease in the flow level indicating the decline in the model performance and the mape of lstm at low flow interval was 10 7 showing poorer performance of cnn compared to lstm 5 discussion a methodology was proposed for creating sff and bff so that the data for the development of a dnn based runoff model will reflect spatial characteristics and they were used as the training data for the cnn then daily runoff was simulated using the trained cnn and the results obtained were good overall the predicted values for cnn were closed to the measured values as shown in figs 10 and 11 which illustrates the relationship between the measured and predicted values table 5 numerically presents the relationships between the measured and predicted values by cnn lstm and anfis based on the nse rmse and mape for the whole fdc and each of the five intervals the nse ranges of 0 75 0 65 0 5 0 4 and 0 4 are classified as excellent good satisfactory acceptable and unsatisfactory respectively barzegar et al 2020 moriasi et al 2007 in this study the nse for all models were 0 9 in the whole fdc and each of the five intervals thus the performance of cnn lstm and anfis was classified as excellent however in the dry condition interval of lstm and the dry condition and low flow intervals of anfis the nse was 0 7 0 6 and 0 5 respectively indicating lower model efficiency than cnn despite these results the reason that the nse of the entire intervals was 0 9 is because the error of high flow is considerably larger compared to the error of low flow when calculating nse as in eq 11 so the error of low flow has not affected the nse result this study also examined rmse for each fdc in order to determine the stability in the predictive performance of the model according to the magnitude of runoff the rmse has a range of 0 to and an rmse of 0 indicates that the predicted value matches the measured value ahmadisharaf et al 2019 however there are no clear classification criteria in contrast to the nse nonetheless when the runoff range of each fdc is used as the evaluation criteria the rmses of all the intervals high flow moist condition mid range flow and dry condition except low flow were smaller than the minimum value of each runoff range this indicates that the proposed cnn has good prediction performance for daily runoff in these intervals in contrast the rmse of the low flow interval was 0 8 which is identical to the maximum value of the runoff range indicating low reliability for daily runoff prediction as presented in table 5 the rmse of lstm was found to be lower than the runoff range in all fdc intervals and the rmse of anfis was found to be lower than the runoff range in the intervals except for dry condition and low flow the mape of the cnn model was 10 7 14 3 15 8 21 2 and 28 5 for high flow moist condition mid range flow dry condition and low flow intervals respectively which was lower than the mape of most lstm and anfis in most cases however it can be seen that the mape of the cnn model was larger in the dry condition and low flow intervals compared to other intervals and in particular the mape of lstm at low flow interval was 10 7 showing poorer prediction performance of cnn compared to lstm we attempted to compare the results of this study with those of previous studies but this was not easy because there have been few studies similar to this study for this reason this study was compared with the previous studies based on classical neural networks and other similar studies yaseen et al 2018 used hybrid intelligent model based anfis firefly algorithm anfis ffa to predict monthly rainfall patterns and the used study data were data over 15 years out of the total study data 9 years of data were used for model optimization and 6 years of data were used for model evaluation the results of the model were 0 999 0 998 and 0 272 mm for r2 coefficient of determination nse and rmse respectively and the researchers of the paper indicated that hybrid intelligent model based anfis ffa is a cautious modeling approach that can be adopted for simulation of monthly rainfall salih et al 2020 proposed a new approach for forecasting of rainfall patterns to eradicate the periodic pattern effects notable on the stationarity behavior of rainfall time series data and utilized a model based on the integration of three stochastic modelling methods including the seasonal differencing and seasonal standardization associated with the genetic algorithm ga in this way the research performed rainfall prediction for six stations and it was reported that r2 values of 0 8 or higher were found at all stations except for one region yaseen et al 2019b performed simulation of monthly rainfall by applying three evolutionary algorithms particle swarm optimization genetic algorithm and differential evolution based on anfis uncertainty analysis was performed to evaluate the predictive performance of each model as a result all models showed higher performance than the existing anfis indicating that anfis shows reliable performance for monthly rainfall prediction kimura et al 2019 predicted the flood levels of two watersheds using the transfer learning method based on the cnn model in domain a one of the two watersheds the rmse was in the range of 0 1 0 5 m and the relative error was in the range of 2 6 6 9 in domain b the other watershed the rmse was in the range of 0 1 0 2 m and the relative error was in the range of 3 3 4 3 liu et al 2021 simulated the runoff for a watershed that recorded an annual average rainfall of 1600 mm and a daily average runoff of 776 89 m3 s 1 using the cl and a long short term memory network with a time attention mechanism con talstm they reported that the rmse and nse of con talstm were in the ranges of 277 70 283 71 m3 s 1 and 0 88 0 89 respectively van et al 2020 developed a 1d cnn for rainfall runoff modeling using data measured at the chau doc and can tho hydro weather stations in the mekong delta region in vietnam the average maximum and minimum runoff of chau doc and can tho were 2583 m3 s 1 133 m3 s 1 and 8210 m3 s 1 and 6371 m3 s 1 0 m3 s 1 and 34 190 m3 s 1 respectively the cnn model using these data exhibited rmses of 89 6 and 834 0 m3 s 1 for chau doc and can tho respectively this study indicated that the cnn is suitable for regression type problems can effectively train the model even without time series data for a long period and tended to outperform the linear and recurrent model wang et al 2020 used a cnn for flood susceptibility mapping the authors evaluated the prediction results of different cnn models i e 1d cnn 2d cnn 3d cnn 1d cnn svm 2d cnn svm and 3d cnn svm and reported that 2d cnn svm exhibited the highest accuracy 87 5 thus the result of our study is similar to or higher than the results of previous studies although it is difficult to generalize through a comparison of the present study with previous studies that the sff and bff are functional as input data for the cnn the cnn performance results of this study suggest that the sff and bff are applicable as input data however the proposed methodology had limitations when simulating small runoffs this is because the bff which is in charge of simulating the base flow has a simpler structure than the sff and the spatial characteristics of the sff and bff could not be effectively derived because the cnn architecture used in this study is simpler than those of previous studies another reason is that the cnn model does not reflect an in depth understanding of hydrological phenomena in the case of the watershed in this study as shown in fig 10 when there is an event of rainfall corresponding to high flow during the fdc interval the change in runoff also occurs rapidly but in other intervals no immediate changes in runoff are observed according to the rainfall compared to the change in the high flow interval as a possible reason for this phenomenon lag time which different depending on rainfall intensity or topographical conditions may be considered it is true that this study also considers antecedent moisture condition amc as the effect of the antecedent rainfall but this is only the classification of the moisture condition of the soil into three levels by cn and it insufficient to reflect the various rainfall intensities and lag time as an alternative approach to address the problem of lag time long short term memory lstm hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 can be proposed fu et al 2020 used lstm for runoff prediction over time intervals and reported that the lstm model not only has a distinct advantage in processing steady flow data in the dry season but also shows an excellent ability to capture data features in rapidly changing flow data in the monsoon season as can be seen from the discussion it is thought that better results can be achieved if a methodology that allows consideration of the time dependent effect in the prediction results can be applied to this study in fact in the recent development of ann the majority of studies tend to develop a model combining two or more algorithms rather than using a single algorithm in this regard fotovatikhah et al 2018 recently reported that compared to the single respective application of the conventional artificial intelligence and computational intelligence if the model can be developed using the ensemble technique it showed higher predictive performance mosavi et al 2018 also mentioned the high efficiency of models using combined algorithms in this regard it is considered that a methodology that utilizes combination of multiple algorithms would be more effective in achieving the higher performance of the model and this is expected to contribute to overcoming the limitations of the proposed model used in this study and consideration of a variety of hydrological phenomena as discussed above this study had clear limitations but the objective of creating data reflecting spatial characteristics to facilitate the development of a dnn based runoff model that is highly dependent on meteorological data was achieved in particular the methodology that can simply generate data with only five items rainfall runoff groundwater level land cover map and soil map can solve the difficulty of data collection for training a neural network furthermore although it was not covered in this study this methodology using the scs cn has the advantage of reflecting changes in various topographical conditions thus enabling runoff simulation for a scenario in which topographical conditions are changed furthermore the proposed methodology is applicable to runoff simulation of global or regional unmeasured watersheds when used together with remote sensing or satellite images 6 conclusions a methodology was proposed for creating sff and bff data that reflect the spatial characteristics to overcome the trend of depending on meteorological data in the development of a dnn based runoff model to examine the applicability of these two features daily runoff was simulated by using them as the training data for a cnn a type of dnn the daily runoff values predicted by the cnn using the sff and bff exhibited high accuracy indicating the applicability of the sff and bff to the runoff model based on the cnn however in this study simple bff were created due to the limitation of data collection and there was also a limitation of using a general cnn to examine whether the data created by the proposed methodology properly served as the input data in cnn for these reasons it is considered that the model has low performance in the magnitude of runoff 1 5 m3 s 1 day 1 which corresponds to the dry condition and low flow intervals of fdc therefore we plan to conduct a follow up study on the enhancement of the accuracy of smaller daily runoffs by improving the bff and cnn although this study had a limitation and requires follow up research it is believed to have a high utility value because the proposed method has advantages such as the ability to perform daily runoff simulation using two types of features the ability to reflect topographical conditions and applicability to the fields of remote sensing and satellite imaging declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
3726,a conceptual runoff model mathematically expresses hydrological phenomena originating from spatial and temporal changes based on physical laws thus it can describe causal relationships for runoff changes however these models are difficult to run owing to their complex structures and the need for a large amount of data the development of runoff models using deep neural networks dnn which belong to the category of empirical models is continuously increasing owing to the advantages of dnn such as the modeling convenience and high prediction performance however dnn based runoff models have difficulty reflecting topographical and spatial characteristics such as land cover and physical soil characteristics because they mainly depend on meteorological data the objective of the present study was to overcome the limitation of data use that depends on meteorological data and to reflect topographical characteristics in dnn based runoff models by suggesting a data creation methodology that reflects spatial characteristics this paper proposes a methodology for producing two types of two dimensional features surface flow features sff and base flow features bff using the soil conservation service curve number and groundwater level to determine the applicability of the features the daily runoff was simulated using the generated features as input data of the convolutional neural network cnn which is a type of dnn the cnn architecture was improved to have a multi input structure and derive continuous variables because the ordinary cnn was difficult to apply in this study after the cnn was trained the daily runoff was simulated and the applicability of the features as input data of the dnn was evaluated the daily runoff predictions of the cnn using the sff and bff exhibited moderate levels this indicates that the sff and bff have sufficient value as input data of the cnn keywords surface flow feature base flow feature curve number convolution neural network daily runoff 1 introduction the global demand for water is growing rapidly with the development of industries and cultures and detailed water resource management planning is needed to cope with changing rainfall patterns such as local torrential rainfall and droughts in particular in south korea the bulk of the rainfall received by the country tends to be concentrated between june and september with the recent changes in the rainfall pattern there have been frequent events of localized torrential rainfall in which the maximum daily rainfall amounts to 25 of the annual rainfall leading to a continuous increase in the damage in addition the country has been implementing total monthly daily loads based management of water pollution and due to the change in the daily rainfall patterns during the rainy season there have been cases of exceeding the allowable maximum pollution loads since these cases of exceeding the allowable pollution loads result in imposing of penalties in regional development for local governments the changing rainfall patterns cause difficulties in management of water pollution for this reason there has been an increasing emphasis on the importance of fast prediction of daily flow according to various rainfall patterns in south korea thus the importance of runoff prediction based on various rainfall patterns is increasing and the development and utilization of a runoff model can be proposed as a method for predicting runoff runoff models are effective scientifically for water resource management and water use planning othman and naseri 2011 and can help establish policies in the field of water resource utilization singh et al 2013 runoff models can be largely classified into conceptual and empirical models conceptual models mathematically express complex hydrological phenomena maier et al 2010 caused by spatial and temporal changes according to physical laws nourani et al 2012 some examples include the clark hydrograph clark 1945 nash model nash 1957 laurenson model laurenson 1964 stream synthesis and reservoir regulation model rockwood 1964 and hydrologic engineering center river analysis storm water management model rossman 2010 and system usace 2016 conceptual models have been extensively used in runoff predictions of rivers arnold and fohrer 2005 brunner and simmons 2012 wagener et al 2001 however some operational parts of these models are complex in general conceptual models approximate the model derived value to the measured value through parameter adjustment and sensitivity analysis tokar and markus 2000 beven and freer 2001 however it is not easy to reproduce complex hydrological phenomena caused by various spatial and temporal changes as well as the rainfall patterns and physical factors of watersheds via parameter adjustment and sensitivity analysis in particular parameter adjustment requires a high level of hydrological expertise because the user must have accurate knowledge about the characteristics and meaning of each parameter thus the operation of conceptual models is highly limited and it is challenging for frontline government agencies that must establish water management plans to make intuitive decisions kratzert et al 2018 yaseen et al 2019a moreover a conceptual model requires numerous input data as well as testing and calibration procedures which are cumbersome owing to these characteristics the calibration of suitable parameters is being actively researched and is becoming a research trend duan et al 1992 cheng et al 2002 chen et al 2016 additionally because a conceptual model must express complex natural phenomena as a set of equations it is not easy to numerically represent the relationship between rainfall and runoff for a specific watershed and this requires the collection of numerous data maier et al 2010 an empirical model can be employed as a decision making process to reach a reasonable conclusion based on collected data in contrast to a conceptual model it is developed using a stable relationship between input and output values and without using a physical law patel and joshi 2017 an empirical model can be more efficient than a conceptual model for a site with a lack of experts in water resource management planning because it is easier to develop and operate many researchers have developed runoff models using artificial neural networks ann which express nonlinear structures well and have reported that they can yield better results than conceptual models mishra and karmakar 2019 shoaib et al 2016 farias et al 2013 zhang and govindaraju 2000 huo et al 2017 ann that belong to the category of empirical models have evolved into deep neural networks dnn which are being researched for many applications including voice recognition chen et al 2018 ekins 2016 natural language processing young et al 2018 collobert and weston 2008 and image classification chan et al 2015 perez and wang 2017 with studies reporting their high efficiency ann have attracted interest from many hydrologists as they have been applied to hydrological predictions based on the electric signal mechanisms of the brain and nervous system since the 1990s wang et al 2009 luger 2005 terzi and ergin 2014 valipour et al 2012 among the studies related to this topic minns and hall 1996 developed a runoff model using an ann and reported that the model accuracy increased with the number of hidden layers and that additional computational effort for analyzing the typical nonlinear behaviors of rainfall and runoff is not justified in many watersheds senthil kumar et al 2005 compared the performance of the multilayer perceptron mlp and radial basis function which is an ann method to reconsider the perception that the ann has a higher performance than the mlp in hydrology they reported that the method should be selected according to the purpose as both methods have their own advantages and disadvantages asadi et al 2013 proposed a hybrid ann combining the conventional ann with data preprocessing a genetic algorithm and the levenberg marquardt algorithm and they reported an accuracy higher than those of the general ann and neuro fuzzy inference system in these studies on runoff models using ann the model performance was enhanced through repeated improvements recently with the development of dnn with a higher performance than that of ann the research on runoff models is naturally moving toward dnn hu et al 2018 pointed out that the previous research on runoff modeling using ann seldom involved time series predictions and they developed a rainfall runoff model using time series data with long short term memory lstm which is a type of dnn they reported that the lstm exhibited higher performance than the conventional ann kratzert et al 2019 proposed entity aware lstm ea lstm which is an improved version of lstm and found that it is suitable for rainfall runoff modeling compared to a conceptual model although the runoff pattern is significantly influenced by the rainfall pattern runoffs are manifested in various forms by the topographical conditions of the watershed such as the physical characteristics of the land cover and soil sajikumar and remya 2015 ogden et al 2013 in many previous studies involving dnn researchers mainly used meteorological data such as the rainfall evapotranspiration temperature dew point humidity atmospheric pressure and wind speed as input for model development kratzert et al 2021 liu et al 2021 xiang and demir 2020 zhang et al 2021 studies where input data were used to reflect topographical conditions are rare the reason why the input data of the dnn are limited to meteorological data is the structure of the dnn in general the data input to a dnn have a one dimensional 1d vector format thus it is difficult for the dnn to handle spatial characteristics such as topographical conditions however the convolutional neural network cnn proposed by lecun et al 1998 can learn spatial characteristics and is used for image classification speech recognition and image segmentation alireza et al 2015 taravat et al 2015 it has rapidly become a core technology in the image classification field owing to advantages such as the derivation of reliable results and a high efficiency cnn is also used in hydrology van et al 2020 developed a runoff model using a cnn they designed the cnn architecture to use 1d input data and simulate runoff according to rainfall and the results were slightly better than those obtained using lstm consequently the authors concluded that cnn is appropriate for regression problems miao et al 2019 proposed a model that combined a cnn and lstm and presented improved results for prediction of precipitation than a general cnn model li et al 2018 suggested cnn based convolutional deep belief networks cdbn and simulated runoff they reported that the cdbn accurately represented the nonlinearity of the runoff and had an excellent runoff prediction ability although many of the previous studies described above have actively utilized the latest dnn technique in the field of hydrology most of the data used in these studies are limited to vector type meteorological data making it impossible to reflect the topographical characteristics or effect of spatial characteristics of the watershed on the runoff in particular for this reason it is difficult to apply flow simulation using the latest dnn technology in watersheds of south korea since more than 70 of the country s terrain is covered by forests in addition the effect of changes in the land use cannot be reflected which may cause difficulties in the interpretation of flow simulation results this study presents a novel intuitive data creation methodology that reflects spatial characteristics to overcome the limitations of data used in the conventional dnn models in addition in order to evaluate the applicability of the data the created data are used as input data of cnn which has excellent performances in learning spatial characteristics to perform daily runoff simulation in this way the present study proposes a new methodology of runoff simulation that allows fast simulation of daily runoff taking into account the topographical conditions the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the study area and materials section 3 describes the data creation methodology reflecting spatial characteristics and the improved cnn architecture section 4 presents the results of applying cnn to the constructed data section 5 discusses the applicability of the data finally section 6 presents conclusions and suggests future works 2 study area data and tools 2 1 study area the jojong watershed which is close to the capital area of south korea was selected as the study area as shown in fig 1 it is one of the watersheds surrounding paldang lake a major water resource of the capital area of south korea located approximately 27 3 km from seoul the capital of south korea paldang lake supplies water to approximately 50 of the total population of south korea to secure stable water resources from paldang lake the south korean government is applying strict regulations to the watersheds surrounding lake the jojong watershed is also subject to strict regulations for water quality preservation and there has been little change in land cover for nearly three decades that is the watershed in this study is characterized by the fact that the data of rainfall runoff and groundwater level were not affected by changes in land use which indicates that the flow variations with respect to changes in land use do not need to be reflected in the analysis of this study in particular there is an advantage that the application of land cover status that has had little change over a long study period facilitates easier process in conducting the study therefore the watershed was considered to be appropriate for the purpose of this study and set as the study area the jojong river is the main river in the jojong watershed e 127 25 08 08 n 37 43 41 72 with a length of approximately 39 km and the watershed area of 260 6 km2 owing to the effect of the aforementioned regulations the jojong watershed is mostly composed of forests 79 6 other land covers consist of pasture 7 4 upland 5 2 urban 2 2 and paddy 1 7 table 1 2 2 study data five data items were required for data creation in this study rainfall runoff groundwater level land cover map and soil map in this study it was difficult to perform direct measurement of the study data due to limitations of human resources and budget so data provided online by the government of the republic of korea were used the rainfall data were collected from the korea meteorological administration kma 0000 the runoff and soil map were obtained from the water resources management information system wamis 0000 the groundwater level data were collected from the national groundwater information center ngic 0000 and the land cover map was obtained from the environmental geographic information service egis 0000 here the groundwater level data was provided only up to 2018 at the time of data collection so the data collection period was limited to the end of 2018 for this reason the study period was set from january 1 2010 to december 31 2018 the observed points for rainfall runoff and groundwater level are shown in fig 1 the rainfall data consist of daily data mm d 1 from nine rain stations the runoff data include daily average data m3 s 1 d 1 at the end of the study in the watershed and the groundwater levels represent daily average data el m d 1 of seven groundwater level stations the land cover map is composed of eight land covers water urban barren pasture forest paddy upland and wetland the soil map contains the physical properties of 59 soils table 2 2 3 study tools this study was conducted on a windows os based desktop computer with an intel core i9 9900 k central processing unit cpu 3 60 ghz 32g random access memory ram and an ndivia geforce rtx 2080ti graphics processing unit gpu python 2020 was used for data creation and keras 2020 was used for the design implementation and operation of the cnn model keras uses tensorflow tensorflow 2020 a machine learning library released by google as a backend all the special features of tensorflow are supported by the high level dnn application programming interface created using python and keras has a high flexibility in dnn model implementation furthermore keras allows fast experimentation because it can efficiently use the cpu and gpu 3 methodology the methodology of this study can be summarized as follows 1 present a data creation method reflecting the topographical and rainfall conditions and create data 2 use the created data as the training data for the cnn and perform a daily runoff simulation 3 evaluate the applicability of the data through the simulation results this methodology uses the two dimensional 2d matrix structure instead of the 1d vector format as the data format because the data must reflect spatial characteristics this is also the reason why a cnn is used in this study cnn is one of the dnn algorithms that uses a feed forward network to extract topological features from images in addition there are models derived from cnn such as region based cnn yang et al 2017 fast r cnn girshick 2015 and faster r cnn kim et al 2018 there is also an algorithm named you only look once yolo redmon et al 2016 with which you only look once at an image to predict what objects are present and where the objects are among these different algorithms in this study the cnn algorithm was selected this is to prevent the proposed data creation methodology from being affected by another improved algorithm in hydrology the runoff in a river when rainfall occurs is theoretically defined as the sum of the surface flow and base flow and when there is no rain only the base flow occurs the data creation methodology of this study is based on the aforementioned theoretical background and can be summarized as creating two types of features to consider the conditions with and without rainfall when constructing the input data of the cnn the use of red green and blue rgb images such as photographs which are used in the conventional cnn can be suggested however using rgb images in an empirical model for hydrological research can compromise the fundamental premise of the empirical model even if excellent results are obtained using general rgb images the value of each pixel comprising rgb images expresses colors in the range of 0 255 which are meaningless because they cannot explain the causal relationship between rainfall and runoff in order to address these limitations satellite images can be used many of the previous studies have already reported the application of satellite images to neural network models with satellite images since the reflection of light is divided by wavelength band additional preprocessing is necessary to consider the land use or meteorological conditions also since there is a large number of wavelengths it is not practically easy to find satellite images suitable for the model thus to maintain the premise of the empirical model this paper proposes a methodology for creating surface flow features sff and base flow features bff reflecting spatial changes according to the wet and dry conditions the proposed methodology for creating sff and bff can resolve the above mentioned drawbacks of satellite images and has the advantage of the easy and simple construction of data for cnn models the tiff file format was used for the features because if the features newly created by the proposed method are saved in jpg bmp or png format they are transformed into color values in the range of 0 255 resulting in information loss to utilize sff and bff a cnn a type of dnn was used in this study a general cnn was designed to perform binary or category classification for images input through a single input path however this cnn architecture required improvement because it was unsuitable for the use of two types of images in this study thus the cnn architecture was improved to comprise two input paths and allow the simulation of continuous daily runoff by extracting the spatial characteristics of each feature 3 1 sff 3 1 1 procedure for creating sff typical photographs are composed of pixels with various colors accordingly sff were generated in the present study among the research data as mentioned above the data indicating spatial characteristics are the land cover map and soil map as shown in table 2 both these data are in raster format composed of a set of grids with different values the concept of generating sff is illustrated in fig 2 the sff is created by assigning a newly calculated value using the values of rainfall land cover and soil map to each grid the grids red dotted lines in fig 2 could complicate the understanding of the grid calculation process because they are expressed larger than the actual size used in this study the grids were actually calculated one by one 3 1 2 rainfall feature thiessen polygons schumann 1998 have been used to calculate rainfall over a broad range in hydrology however they have the generate discontinuous rainfall variations in the space because a different rainfall is estimated for each polygon webster and oliver 2001 as such when a thiessen polygon is used in this study the feature change shapes become monotonous making it unsuitable for training the cnn model as an alternative method to the thiessen polygon the application of a spatial interpolation method can be proposed the examples of using the spatial interpolation method in previous studies include the inverse distance weighted method idw miller 2004 kriging method cressie 1990 and spline method azpurua and dos ramos 2010 there are various options for each method simple kriging ordinary kriging co kriging and universal kriging for kriging method and regularized spline spline with tensor multi quadratic inverse multi quadratic and thin plate spline for the spline method on the contrary idw has the advantages of simplicity of the method and efficient implementation of spatial interpolation and does not provide additional options as in the above mentioned spatial interpolation method since the main focus of this study is the data creation methodology and its applicability it was considered not appropriate to implement multiple spatial interpolation methods and idw was thought to be most appropriate in terms of minimizing the effect of applying the spatial interpolation method therefore idw was adopted as the spatial interpolation method in this study inverse distance weighting idw a spatial interpolation method is used to decide the value of an unobserved point by assigning a weight based on the distance between the observed point and its neighboring point according to tobler s law of geography miller 2004 idw has the advantage of generating features of more various shapes than thiessen polygons because it is based on the assumption that the distance between an unobserved point and a neighboring observed point is inversely proportional to the observed value in this study to avoid the monotony of thiessen polygons rainfall features of the grid type are constructed using the rainfall data of the vector format through idw zx eq 1 1 z x i 1 n w i z x i i 1 n w i w 1 l i 2 where z x represents the estimated value of the unobserved point w i represents the weight z x represents the observed value of the neighboring point and l i represents the distance from the unobserved point to the observed point 3 1 3 calculation of grid values in a feature in fig 2 each grid is calculated using the curve number cn scs 1985 proposed by the soil conservation service scs which is the predecessor of the u s national resource conservation service ponce and hawkins 1996 pointed out the disadvantages of the cn e g sensitivity to the selection of cn lack of clear explanation about antecedent soil moisture condition amc change in cn for different biota lack of clear explanation about change in space scale and initial loss value fixed to 0 2 however various studies have been conducted using the cn and its usefulness for hydrological analysis has been continuously demonstrated chen and wang 2015 deshmukh et al 2013 ebrahimian et al 2012 mishra et al 2006 soulis and valiantzas 2012 shi et al 2009 the cn is derived using conditions such as rainfall soil characteristics and land cover it is useful for simulating direct runoff and evaluating hydrological effects li et al 2018 wang and chen 2019 additionally this study revealed that the cn can be used in sff generation considering the usefulness of the cn for hydrological analysis the cn is determined by calculating the total runoff of watersheds q eqs 2 and 3 using the rainfall p and residual water storage s eq 4 the same calculation process used for the cn is performed for sff creation as well but the q in the sff is determined for each grid instead of only one cn for an entire watershed furthermore the calculated q for each grid is set as a dimensionless value ignoring the unit 2 q p 0 2 s 2 p 0 8 s p i a i a 0 2 s 3 q 0 p i a i a 0 2 s 4 s 25400 c n 254 in eq 4 the cn plays a key role in the determination of the grid value it is assigned according to the physical characteristics and land cover conditions of four types of soils classified into hydrologic soil group hsg a b c and d the scs provides these cn values as a table but they have errors for use in south korea owing to the different topographical conditions the ministry of land infrastructure and transport of south korea mlit 2012 published modified cn in the design flood estimation techniques dfet and recommends using these cn thus in the present study the cn of the study area was derived using the land cover map and soil map provided by the dfet of the ministry of land infrastructure and transport the scs recommends the adjustment of cni cni eq 5 and cniii cniii eq 6 in consideration of antecedent rainfalls the reason for considering the antecedent rainfall is to estimate the soil saturation of the surface due to the antecedent rainfall and the change in direct runoff occurring in the surface following the saturation as conventional methods that can evaluate the direct runoff and base flow by antecedent rainfall the straight line method the n day method and the baseflow recession curve can be proposed however when using these methods they derive 1d data applicable to the entire watershed resulting in a difficulty in expanding the data into 2d type data required in sff as an alternative to the above methods antecedent rainfall proposed in soil conservation service curve number scs cn can be used in this study and this method can be sufficiently utilized for the creation of sff scs cn method considers the effect of the antecedent moisture condition amc according to the antecedent rainfall here antecedent rainfalls refer to 5 day cumulative rainfall p5 on the runoff the amc is divided into dry and wet seasons and can also be classified into three levels as amci ii and iii in the present study as suggested by the scs the grid value was calculated using the amc which is affected by the period and condition in daily units according to the climate of korea the dry and wet seasons are said to range from october to may and june to september respectively furthermore the daily amc was determined by calculating the daily p5 and the daily adjusted cn was calculated using eqs 5 and 6 table 3 5 c n i 4 2 c n i i 10 0 058 c n

bff the sff created using eqs 2 and 3 cannot represent the spatial changes under dry conditions because the q of each grid becomes zero if the rainfall is zero or smaller than the effective rainfall i a to simulate the daily runoff in this study both dry and rainy conditions must be considered however daily runoff simulation is impossible with the sff because the sff can be created in rainy conditions only thus features other than the sff which reflects the rain condition are required as an alternative the runoff from a river under dry conditions can be considered in general runoff continuously occurs in natural rivers even under dry conditions this implies that the base flow forms the river flow and the runoff under dry conditions is dependent on the ground water in fact in many previous studies it is assumed that the base flow occurs from groundwater and there have been studies that investigated groundwater budget or groundwater recharge walton 1965 o hearn and gibb 1980 mau and winter 1997 hence in this study it is assumed that the runoff change under dry conditions is based on the change in the groundwater volume and the magnitude of the base flow is indirectly determined using the groundwater level furthermore to express the spatial change in the groundwater level by features spatial interpolation is performed using the data at the point where the groundwater level is measured along with idw as shown in fig 1 this feature is a bff which is constructed as a grid feature with the same resolution as the land cover and soil maps 3 3 target and labeling for the learning method of the cnn model the supervised learning method which repeatedly decreases the error between the measured and predicted values is used in the neural network field the measured value is generally referred to as the target in this study the daily runoff collected as described in section 2 2 corresponds to the target to train the cnn the task of labeling which involves matching a feature with the target is required this study also requires a labeled dataset and the sff bff and runoff are composed as one labeled dataset here labeled indicates that the runoff was matched with the sff and bff of the same date in this study the target was constructed simply as a comma separated value csv file in contrast to the complex creation method for the sff and bff then labeling was performed so that the sff bff and runoff target would be composed as one labeled dataset with h5 as the file format the process of creating the sff and bff and constructing a dataset is described in fig 3 3 4 cnn 3 4 1 cnn architecture the cnn model was inspired by the visual processing method of animals for recognizing objects lecun et al 1998 the cnn is generally composed of a convolutional layer cl a pooling layer pl and a dense layer which is also called a fully connected layer fc the cnn can use not only the input data of the 1d vector format in the ann but also two and three dimensional data the main characteristic of the cnn is that it can learn and efficiently extract the spatial features of input data the layers that perform this are the cl and pl which are handled as a pair in the cnn architecture and this is simply referred to as a conv layer the fc has one or more dense layers between the flatten layer and output which is identical to the general dnn architecture medina et al 2017 zeiler and fergus 2014 for this study the general cnn architecture that receives one input is improved to an architecture that receives two inputs as shown in fig 4 this cnn has two conv layers each of which extracts the features of the sff and bff the structure of each conv layer was designed similarly to visual geometry group 16 vgg 16 in visual geometry group net vgg net simonyan and zisserman 2014 although there are models that can derive better results than vgg 16 such as googlenet and residual net resnet he et al 2016 the cnn architecture used in this study was designed with a similar structure to vgg 16 because vgg net achieves satisfactory performance above a certain level with a relatively simple structure furthermore the information extracted from the two conv layers must be reflected in the runoff simulation and the layer that performs this role is the concatenate layer the concatenate layer combines the spatial information extracted from each conv layer and then passes the combined information of the conv layers to the fc as input data lastly the fc derives the daily runoff using the information received from the concatenate layer typically the cnn uses a softmax or sigmoid function as the activation function of the last dense layer of the fc however this is not suitable for deriving a continuous variable such as daily runoff hence in this study the linear function which is often used in regression analysis was selected as the activation function of the last dense layer of the fc the complete structure of the fc is composed of four dense layers followed by a batch normalization layer to prevent overfitting and then a dense layer the first four dense layers were designed sequentially with 4096 8192 8192 and 8192 nodes and the last dense layer was designed with one node 3 4 2 layer configuration of cnn the cnn uses an image filter of a square matrix form called a kernel which plays the role of a parameter for finding the features of images while searching for a cl in this study the size of every kernel of the cl was set to 3 3 and the numbers of kernels were set to 32 32 64 64 128 128 256 256 512 and 512 in the order of the conv layers the stride i e the search interval of the kernels was set to 2 for the first and second cls and to 1 for the other cls for extracting the image features kernels cause a loss of image information because they reduce the image in the process of extracting the image features therefore information loss is prevented by setting padding in the cl the padding of the cnn in this study was set to same to prevent the loss of image information additionally each cl has an activation function and in this study the rectified linear unit relu eq 7 was used as the activation function the relu can generally avoid the gradient vanishing phenomenon and has a high model optimization efficiency chen and ho 2019 7 r e l u max 0 x the pl comes after the cl and plays the role of reducing the size of the information received from the cl leaving only important information this allows efficient use of the computer memory because the amount of information to calculate is reduced and overfitting can be prevented the pl can be categorized as max pooling and average pooling in this study only max pooling was used because average pooling has the risk of information loss the pooling size was set to 2 2 3 4 3 training of the cnn the cnn which uses supervised learning repeatedly reduces the error between the measured and predicted values for which it continuously improves the weighted value in the neural network in general an error in the neural network field is called a loss and the goal of supervised learning is to optimize the model by minimizing the loss the degree of learning of a model can be determined by the change in the loss which can be monitored by setting a loss function a cnn for classification generally uses binary cross entropy sparce categorical cross entropy or categorical cross entropy as a loss function however these loss functions are not suitable when simulating a continuous variable such as runoff thus in this study the mean squared error mse eq 8 which is mainly used in regression analysis was used as the loss function and it was employed to determine the training result and optimization level of the model for the prediction performance which must be examined in model training the mean absolute error mae eq 9 was used as the examination metric 8 m s e 1 n i 1 n y i y i 2 9 m a e 1 n i 1 n y i y i where y i and y i denote the measured and predicted values respectively the performance of the model is higher when the mse and mae are closer to zero even if the cnn training result based on the mse and mae is good or excellent the model must be validated for generalization to this end in the present study a cnn model was developed by dividing the dataset into a training dataset and a validation dataset the mse and mae for the training dataset are referred to as loss and mae respectively and the mse and mae for the validation dataset are referred to as val loss and val mae respectively the cnn uses various optimization methods to minimize error similar to the dnn for optimization stochastic gradient descent sgd bottou 2010 is considered as the most basic algorithm but it is highly inefficient for optimizing the model to improve this the following optimization algorithms have been developed nesterov accelerated gradient nesterov 1983 momentum qian 1999 adagrad duchi et al 2011 adadelta zeiler 2012 nadam dozat 2016 rmsprop hinton and tieleman 2014 and adam kingma and ba 2014 in this study adamax an extension of the adam algorithm was used as an algorithm based on the update rule of adam adamax which exhibits better performance in the cnn model especially adamax performs fast optimization when the data change is large and outperforms other algorithms under noisy conditions kingma and ba 2014 hence adamax was selected as the most suitable optimization algorithm for the cnn model because the runoff to be simulated has large variations according to the hydrological phenomena and the variables in the natural conditions are subject to a wide variety of noisy conditions herein the learning rate was set to 0 0001 and the number of epochs was 500 3 5 evaluation methodology 3 5 1 classical model for comparison of model performance for comparison and evaluation of the flow prediction results of the methodology proposed in this study the flow of the study area was modeled using long short term memory lstm and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis which were frequently employed in previous studies lstm hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 is one of the ann optimized for handling the static time series data such as natural language processing nlp lstm is a deep learning technique capable of addressing the vanishing gradient problem faced in the existing recurrent neural network rnn and is suitable for predicting seasonal and temporal variation of flow ni et al 2020 anfis jang 1993 is a model that combines neuro fuzzy systems nfs and artificial neural networks ann among linear time series models it has been applied to various applications in water resource management reported having excellent performance yurdusev and firat 2009 ocampo duque et al 2007 for the lstm and anfis models used in this study the basic architecture of the models was used as they are without modification and since the theoretical background for the respective models is well documented this will not be described in this study in addition for the study data for lstm and anfis models rainfall data runoff data and groundwater level data in table 2 were used 3 5 2 comparison of flow duration curve the degree of flow variations in a watershed depends on the rainfall duration rainfall intensity lag time watershed area river length and land cover as well as various other factors thus in previous studies the correlation between the rainfall and runoff was analyzed to determine the flow characteristics however this makes it difficult to identify flow variations for a specific period and examining the reaction pattern of the overall watershed is inconvenient as an alternative approach the water level survey wls and flow duration curve fdc can be used the wls in south korea classifies the water level into seven levels based on the frequency of occurrence as follows lowest water level drought water level ordinary water level abundant water level high water level flood water level and highest water level since wls classifies the flow based on various water levels it is useful in establishing detailed water resource management plans however wls has drawbacks in terms of the instability of flow variations when there is a change in the cross section of the river even when the same water level of wls is measured on the other hand fdc performs classification by direct utilization of the volume of the flow so it does not have the problem of instability as in the case of wls in addition since the volume of flow is used for classification fdc is more intuitive than wls that presents the result in terms of water levels therefore in this study the fdc method was used for classification of the flow the fdc can be used to analyze the flow variations over the entire range by probabilistically identifying the overall flow conditions dingman 2002 vogel and fenessey 1994 in addition it can represent the cumulative frequency of time series flow data for a specific period the x axis of the fdc represents the flow duration or time percentage similar to the cumulative frequency distribution and the y axis represents the daily runoff the fdc can be used to investigate the overall flow reaction pattern for the entire range of river runoff the fdc is created using the daily runoff excess ratio eq 10 which is the percentage of the number of days with a specific flow exceeding a certain level for which the daily runoff data are listed in descending order from the largest runoff to the smallest runoff the fdc divides the daily runoff excess ratio into five intervals of 10 40 60 and 90 which correspond to high flow moist condition mid range flow dry condition and low flow respectively cleland 2002 in this study the fdc of the measured values and values predicted by the cnn were plotted and compared for each section to determine whether the sff and bff can be applied as the training data for the cnn 10 d a i l y r u n o f f e x c e s s r a t i o r u n o ff r a n k n u m b er o f m e a s u r e m e n t 100 3 5 3 evaluation metrics to determine whether the proposed sff and bff can be applied as the training data for the cnn the cnn was trained using the sff and bff and the predicted and measured values were compared to determine the performance of the model three metrics were used the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse eq 11 root mean square error rmse eq 12 and mean absolute percent error mape eq 13 the nse is in the range of 0 1 a value of 1 indicates that the model result perfectly matches the measured value in particular nse enables representation of the model s performance in the range from unsatisfactory to excellent facilitating more intuitive decision on the performance of the model 11 n s e 1 i 1 n y i y i 2 i 1 n y i y 2 the rmse quantitatively indicates whether the predicted value of the model is close to the measured value and its range is from 0 to infinity within the range of the data the unit of the rmse is generally identical to the unit of the simulation object thus the unit of the rmse in this study is identical to the unit of the runoff m3 s 1 d 1 although the evaluation criteria for the rmse are not clearly defined a value closer to zero indicates that the model result is closer to the measured value that is since rmse represents the results of how reliable the prediction performance of the cnn model using sff and bff is in units of real measurement and thus was judged to be appropriate for use in this study 12 r m s e 1 n i 1 n y i y i 2 the rmse has scale dependent errors with respect to the prediction target so it is difficult to judge the performance of the model with rmse alone therefore in this study mape was used to provide complementary support in the decision of model performance in addition to rmse the mape indicates the error size as a percentage because the mape is expressed as a percentage between 0 and 100 it is easy to interpret the result however there are no clear judgment criteria for the model performance nonetheless an mape closer to zero indicates that the model has higher performance the mape is expressed as follows 13 m a p e 100 n i 1 n y i y i y i where y i and y i represent the measured and predicted values respectively and y represent the averages of the measured the study flowchart corresponding to sections 3 4 and 3 5 is shown in fig 5 this is the same as the overall flow of this study except for the step of building sff and bff 4 results 4 1 rainfall and runoff the variations of the rainfall and daily runoff during the study period are shown in fig 6 a the daily rainfall during the study period was in the range of 0 358 0 mm and the highest daily rainfall was recorded in 2011 the average rainfall during the study period was 1432 3 mm the annual cumulative rainfall was the lowest in 2014 815 4 mm and the highest in 2011 2289 2 mm the daily runoff during the study period was in the range of 0 1 774 0 m3 s 1 and the highest daily runoff was recorded in 2011 when the daily rainfall was the highest the daily runoff during the study period changed with respect to the intensity of the daily rainfall indicating that the variations of the daily runoff in the study area followed the general natural phenomena to examine the relationship between the runoff and rainfall data a scatterplot was drawn as shown in fig 6 b the coefficient of determination r2 between the runoff and rainfall was 0 558 indicating a low power explanation but the p value i e the result of the analysis of variance test was 0 001 indicating a high significance of the rainfall data hence this study determined that the runoff and rainfall data were fit for use 4 2 groundwater level the groundwater levels at seven groundwater level gauges from 2010 to 2018 are shown in fig 7 in most cases the groundwater levels were high in 2011 when the rainfall was high and low in 2014 and 2015 when the rainfall was low similar to the runoff variations shown in fig 6 a furthermore the groundwater level was higher toward the north and lower toward the south this is because the surrounding region of the study area has topographical conditions where forests with high elevation are located in the northern part and the mainstream of the river in the study area is located in the southern part thus the elevation of the terrain increases toward the north for this reason the groundwater level stations located in the northern part of the study area also have relatively higher elevation which led to the increased elevation of the aquifer toward the north by the forests the groundwater level of g5 was lower than those of g3 and g4 which have similar latitudes this could be because g5 is located near the main stream of the bukhan river in south korea the rice paddies and fields are irrigated in spring march to may which is the peak farming season and the fields are irrigated to cultivate field crops in autumn september to october the study area also has rice paddies and fields near the river and as there are no water resources other than the jojong river in the study area the groundwater level decreases because the groundwater is used for irrigation in spring and autumn when the runoff is low thus because the groundwater level varies according to the changes in rainfall in the study area it can be used to create the bff i e the input data of the cnn model 4 3 results of feature creation and setting cnn dataset during the study period 3287 sff and 3287 bff were generated fig 8 shows the daily rainfall features sff and bff from july 24 to 30 2011 among the features generated in this study each feature has 670 819 grids and each grid represents an area of 30 m 30 m fig 8 a shows the spatial variations of rainfall as the rainfall feature which increased from july 24 2011 reached the peak on july 27 2011 and then decreased consequently the amc changed from amci to amciii fig 8 b shows the spatial variations of the sff the sff did not exhibit spatial variations on july 24 and 30 when a low rainfall occurred whereas a high sff was generated on july 27 when the rainfall was the highest furthermore in contrast to the rainfall feature the sff did not exhibit smooth numerical changes even when the rainfall data are applied to eqs 2 4 the result for the sff is judged to be due to the influence of 32 cns determined by eight types of land cover and four types of hsgs in the study area nevertheless since the sff demonstrate differentiated spatial characteristics by rainfall and cn it presents the potential as relevant data for cnn learning this is attributed to the effect of the cn by the land cover and soil maps thus the sff represent various spatial variations according to the rainfall and cn conditions and the sff are appropriate for the training of the cnn which requires various features fig 8 c shows the spatial variations of the bff in contrast to the sff the bff does not exhibit immediate reactions to rainfalls the bff on july 26 when the rainfall was 200 mm was similar to the bff on july 24 when the rainfall was low furthermore the bff on july 27 was very high owing to prolonged rainfall it decreased slowly with the reduction of rainfall thereafter this suggests that the bff is affected by rainfall but has a delay this characteristic of the bff follows the hydrological theory and indicates its potential for simulating the runoff under dry conditions cnn models generally require input data with the same width and height the sff and bff created in this study have different widths and heights so images need to be interpolated as a method for interpolation pillow pillow 0000 an image module of python can be suggested pillow provides five different image interpolation methods linear lehmann et al 1999 bilinear lehmann et al 1999 hamming harris 1978 bicubic keys 1981 and lanczoc duchon 1979 methods the linear method is the simplest among the five methods and has the advantage of having the fastest image processing speed in addition hirahara et al 2020 reported that when the images processed with the five interpolation methods of pillow were applied to the cnn model and there was no significant difference in accuracy between the linear method and other methods therefore considering the image processing speed and accuracy linear interpolation was judged to be efficient and used in this study fig 8 shows the results of applying linear interpolation to sff and bff fig 9 a and b show the initially created sff and bff and fig 9 c and d show the interpolated sff and bff with the same width and height of 1024 the sff and bff in fig 9 c and d were used as the dataset of cnn with the daily runoff data i e the target data in addition 1096 data 33 3 of the total number of data were used as test data sets to evaluate the applicability of this methodology the constructed dataset was divided into an input dataset and a test dataset for training the cnn model in this study the data from 2010 to 2015 were used as the input dataset and the data from 2016 to 2018 were used as the test dataset the input dataset is divided into training and validation datasets but there is no established criterion for the ratio of these two datasets however in many previous studies 7 3 or 8 2 was used as the ratio of the training and validation datasets alsumaiei 2020 lee et al 2020 mulualem and liou 2020 in the present study the training and validation datasets had a ratio of 7 3 as shown in table 4 and were used for the cnn training 4 4 cnn training results as mentioned in section 2 3 4 the cnn training result is determined using the loss mae val loss and val mae loss and mae were used as metrics for training the model for the input dataset whereas val loss and val mae were used as metrics for generalization of the model there are no clear criteria for judging the training result in a neural network model however in general with the progress of epochs the shapes of the loss validation loss mae and validation mae curves become similar to the exponential function where the base is lower than zero when these values become close to the 0 of the y axis it is considered that the model has been sufficiently trained high performance of the model can be guaranteed if the reduction trend of the metric sufficiently and stably converges to zero additionally the magnitudes and variations of the metrics of the training dataset loss and mae and the metrics of the validation dataset val loss and val mae should be examined if the validation dataset metrics are smaller than the training dataset metrics the cnn is overfit and the model estimation results are not reliable the training results of the cnn model used in this study are shown in fig 10 regarding the metrics of the training dataset loss started with 608 0 m3 s 1 d 1 in the first epoch and decreased to 6 1 m3 s 1 d 1 in the last epoch and mae decreased from 7 3 to 1 3 m3 s 1 d 1 regarding the metrics of the validation dataset val loss started with 308 9 m3 s 1 d 1 in the first epoch and decreased to 96 8 m3 s 1 d 1 in the last epoch and val mae decreased from 7 3 to 3 7 m3 s 1 d 1 the graphs for the training dataset and validation dataset decreased together until approximately 110 epochs then their difference gradually increased and the metrics of the validation dataset appeared higher than the metrics of the training dataset in the final analysis none of the metrics of the cnn model exhibited the ideal training condition because the amplitude appeared large in all the graphs however with increasing epochs they converged close to zero and the metrics of the validation dataset appeared higher than those of the training dataset because overfitting did not occur it was determined that both the training and generalization of the model progressed sufficiently 4 5 cnn estimation results and model evaluation to evaluate the recognition and applicability of the sff and bff data in the cnn the runoff was simulated from 2016 to 2018 using the test dataset and the results are shown in fig 11 and fig 12 fig 11 shows the time series changes of the measured and predicted values the time series change of the daily runoff predicted by the cnn followed the trend of the measured values furthermore a comparison with other models was conducted to determine the level of performance of the cnn model in this study fig 12 shows the linearity and fdc between the measured values and predicted values by cnn lstm and anfis fig 12 a c and e illustrates the linearity between the measured values and the daily runoff predicted by cnn lstm and anfis and fig 12 b d and f presents fdc between the measured values and the daily runoffs predicted by cnn lstm and anfis as can be seen from fig 12 a c and e the values predicted by cnn lstm and anfis were shown to have linearity with the measured values and the higher the flow the stronger the linearity the linearity of the cnn model and the lstm was similar but it is judged that the cnn model has better linearity around 1 00 m3 s 1 day 1 on the other hand the anfis model showed weaker linearity compared to cnn and lstm the fdc was used to identify the trend of the predicted values relative to the measured values according to the magnitude of the runoff as a result of drawing the fdc on the basis of the measured fdc the runoff data were divided into five intervals of high flow 9 5 m3 s 1 d 1 moist condition 2 4 m3 s 1 d 1 mid range flow 1 5 m3 s 1 d 1 dry condition 0 8 m3 s 1 d 1 and low flow 0 8 m3 s 1 d 1 the measured fdc exhibited rapid changes in runoff in the high flow and low flow intervals and gradual changes in runoff in the moist condition mid range flow and dry condition intervals the predicted fdc also exhibited rapid changes in the high flow and low flow intervals and gradual changes in other intervals following the trend of the measured fdc although the predicted fdc approximated the measured fdc relatively stably in the high flow interval it exhibited instability in other intervals in particular the predicted fdc exhibited marked instability in the dry condition and low flow intervals this trend was also observed in lstm and anfis the predicted fdc of lstm showed slight instability in the high flow prediction compared to cnn but showed better runoff prediction results at low flow interval than cnn compared to the predicted fdc of cnn and lstm anfis showed instability in the runoff prediction performance in the entire range of fdc and showed higher instability especially in dry condition and low flow intervals through the fdc results the cnn model of this study showed better runoff prediction results than the lstm and anfis models in the entire range of fdc so it can be expected that the cnn model would show better prediction performance in the runoff prediction according to the magnitude of runoff in order to determine the applicability of sff and ffs to cnn the nse rmse and mape of cnn lstm and anfis are presented as shown in table 5 the nses of cnn lstm and anfis for the whole interval were 0 9 rmse was 2 1 2 2 and 4 3 m3 s 1 day 1 respectively and mape was 17 8 18 6 and 25 5 respectively showing that rmse and mape of cnn were lower than those of lstm and anfis in terms of the nse by intervals it was 0 7 in the dry condition interval of lstm and 0 6 and 0 5 in the dry condition and low flow intervals of anfis respectively indicating lower model efficiency compared to cnn the rmse of cnn by interval was found to be lower than the runoff range in all fdc intervals except for the low flow interval the rmse of lstm was found to be lower than the runoff range in all fdc intervals and the rmse of anfis was found to be lower than the runoff range in all the intervals except for dry condition and low flow intervals the mape of each interval of the cnn model was 10 7 14 3 15 8 21 2 and 28 5 for the respective high flow moist condition mid range flow dry condition and low flow intervals which was lower than the mape of lstm and anfis in most cases however it can be seen that the mape of the cnn model increases with the decrease in the flow level indicating the decline in the model performance and the mape of lstm at low flow interval was 10 7 showing poorer performance of cnn compared to lstm 5 discussion a methodology was proposed for creating sff and bff so that the data for the development of a dnn based runoff model will reflect spatial characteristics and they were used as the training data for the cnn then daily runoff was simulated using the trained cnn and the results obtained were good overall the predicted values for cnn were closed to the measured values as shown in figs 10 and 11 which illustrates the relationship between the measured and predicted values table 5 numerically presents the relationships between the measured and predicted values by cnn lstm and anfis based on the nse rmse and mape for the whole fdc and each of the five intervals the nse ranges of 0 75 0 65 0 5 0 4 and 0 4 are classified as excellent good satisfactory acceptable and unsatisfactory respectively barzegar et al 2020 moriasi et al 2007 in this study the nse for all models were 0 9 in the whole fdc and each of the five intervals thus the performance of cnn lstm and anfis was classified as excellent however in the dry condition interval of lstm and the dry condition and low flow intervals of anfis the nse was 0 7 0 6 and 0 5 respectively indicating lower model efficiency than cnn despite these results the reason that the nse of the entire intervals was 0 9 is because the error of high flow is considerably larger compared to the error of low flow when calculating nse as in eq 11 so the error of low flow has not affected the nse result this study also examined rmse for each fdc in order to determine the stability in the predictive performance of the model according to the magnitude of runoff the rmse has a range of 0 to and an rmse of 0 indicates that the predicted value matches the measured value ahmadisharaf et al 2019 however there are no clear classification criteria in contrast to the nse nonetheless when the runoff range of each fdc is used as the evaluation criteria the rmses of all the intervals high flow moist condition mid range flow and dry condition except low flow were smaller than the minimum value of each runoff range this indicates that the proposed cnn has good prediction performance for daily runoff in these intervals in contrast the rmse of the low flow interval was 0 8 which is identical to the maximum value of the runoff range indicating low reliability for daily runoff prediction as presented in table 5 the rmse of lstm was found to be lower than the runoff range in all fdc intervals and the rmse of anfis was found to be lower than the runoff range in the intervals except for dry condition and low flow the mape of the cnn model was 10 7 14 3 15 8 21 2 and 28 5 for high flow moist condition mid range flow dry condition and low flow intervals respectively which was lower than the mape of most lstm and anfis in most cases however it can be seen that the mape of the cnn model was larger in the dry condition and low flow intervals compared to other intervals and in particular the mape of lstm at low flow interval was 10 7 showing poorer prediction performance of cnn compared to lstm we attempted to compare the results of this study with those of previous studies but this was not easy because there have been few studies similar to this study for this reason this study was compared with the previous studies based on classical neural networks and other similar studies yaseen et al 2018 used hybrid intelligent model based anfis firefly algorithm anfis ffa to predict monthly rainfall patterns and the used study data were data over 15 years out of the total study data 9 years of data were used for model optimization and 6 years of data were used for model evaluation the results of the model were 0 999 0 998 and 0 272 mm for r2 coefficient of determination nse and rmse respectively and the researchers of the paper indicated that hybrid intelligent model based anfis ffa is a cautious modeling approach that can be adopted for simulation of monthly rainfall salih et al 2020 proposed a new approach for forecasting of rainfall patterns to eradicate the periodic pattern effects notable on the stationarity behavior of rainfall time series data and utilized a model based on the integration of three stochastic modelling methods including the seasonal differencing and seasonal standardization associated with the genetic algorithm ga in this way the research performed rainfall prediction for six stations and it was reported that r2 values of 0 8 or higher were found at all stations except for one region yaseen et al 2019b performed simulation of monthly rainfall by applying three evolutionary algorithms particle swarm optimization genetic algorithm and differential evolution based on anfis uncertainty analysis was performed to evaluate the predictive performance of each model as a result all models showed higher performance than the existing anfis indicating that anfis shows reliable performance for monthly rainfall prediction kimura et al 2019 predicted the flood levels of two watersheds using the transfer learning method based on the cnn model in domain a one of the two watersheds the rmse was in the range of 0 1 0 5 m and the relative error was in the range of 2 6 6 9 in domain b the other watershed the rmse was in the range of 0 1 0 2 m and the relative error was in the range of 3 3 4 3 liu et al 2021 simulated the runoff for a watershed that recorded an annual average rainfall of 1600 mm and a daily average runoff of 776 89 m3 s 1 using the cl and a long short term memory network with a time attention mechanism con talstm they reported that the rmse and nse of con talstm were in the ranges of 277 70 283 71 m3 s 1 and 0 88 0 89 respectively van et al 2020 developed a 1d cnn for rainfall runoff modeling using data measured at the chau doc and can tho hydro weather stations in the mekong delta region in vietnam the average maximum and minimum runoff of chau doc and can tho were 2583 m3 s 1 133 m3 s 1 and 8210 m3 s 1 and 6371 m3 s 1 0 m3 s 1 and 34 190 m3 s 1 respectively the cnn model using these data exhibited rmses of 89 6 and 834 0 m3 s 1 for chau doc and can tho respectively this study indicated that the cnn is suitable for regression type problems can effectively train the model even without time series data for a long period and tended to outperform the linear and recurrent model wang et al 2020 used a cnn for flood susceptibility mapping the authors evaluated the prediction results of different cnn models i e 1d cnn 2d cnn 3d cnn 1d cnn svm 2d cnn svm and 3d cnn svm and reported that 2d cnn svm exhibited the highest accuracy 87 5 thus the result of our study is similar to or higher than the results of previous studies although it is difficult to generalize through a comparison of the present study with previous studies that the sff and bff are functional as input data for the cnn the cnn performance results of this study suggest that the sff and bff are applicable as input data however the proposed methodology had limitations when simulating small runoffs this is because the bff which is in charge of simulating the base flow has a simpler structure than the sff and the spatial characteristics of the sff and bff could not be effectively derived because the cnn architecture used in this study is simpler than those of previous studies another reason is that the cnn model does not reflect an in depth understanding of hydrological phenomena in the case of the watershed in this study as shown in fig 10 when there is an event of rainfall corresponding to high flow during the fdc interval the change in runoff also occurs rapidly but in other intervals no immediate changes in runoff are observed according to the rainfall compared to the change in the high flow interval as a possible reason for this phenomenon lag time which different depending on rainfall intensity or topographical conditions may be considered it is true that this study also considers antecedent moisture condition amc as the effect of the antecedent rainfall but this is only the classification of the moisture condition of the soil into three levels by cn and it insufficient to reflect the various rainfall intensities and lag time as an alternative approach to address the problem of lag time long short term memory lstm hochreiter and schmidhuber 1997 can be proposed fu et al 2020 used lstm for runoff prediction over time intervals and reported that the lstm model not only has a distinct advantage in processing steady flow data in the dry season but also shows an excellent ability to capture data features in rapidly changing flow data in the monsoon season as can be seen from the discussion it is thought that better results can be achieved if a methodology that allows consideration of the time dependent effect in the prediction results can be applied to this study in fact in the recent development of ann the majority of studies tend to develop a model combining two or more algorithms rather than using a single algorithm in this regard fotovatikhah et al 2018 recently reported that compared to the single respective application of the conventional artificial intelligence and computational intelligence if the model can be developed using the ensemble technique it showed higher predictive performance mosavi et al 2018 also mentioned the high efficiency of models using combined algorithms in this regard it is considered that a methodology that utilizes combination of multiple algorithms would be more effective in achieving the higher performance of the model and this is expected to contribute to overcoming the limitations of the proposed model used in this study and consideration of a variety of hydrological phenomena as discussed above this study had clear limitations but the objective of creating data reflecting spatial characteristics to facilitate the development of a dnn based runoff model that is highly dependent on meteorological data was achieved in particular the methodology that can simply generate data with only five items rainfall runoff groundwater level land cover map and soil map can solve the difficulty of data collection for training a neural network furthermore although it was not covered in this study this methodology using the scs cn has the advantage of reflecting changes in various topographical conditions thus enabling runoff simulation for a scenario in which topographical conditions are changed furthermore the proposed methodology is applicable to runoff simulation of global or regional unmeasured watersheds when used together with remote sensing or satellite images 6 conclusions a methodology was proposed for creating sff and bff data that reflect the spatial characteristics to overcome the trend of depending on meteorological data in the development of a dnn based runoff model to examine the applicability of these two features daily runoff was simulated by using them as the training data for a cnn a type of dnn the daily runoff values predicted by the cnn using the sff and bff exhibited high accuracy indicating the applicability of the sff and bff to the runoff model based on the cnn however in this study simple bff were created due to the limitation of data collection and there was also a limitation of using a general cnn to examine whether the data created by the proposed methodology properly served as the input data in cnn for these reasons it is considered that the model has low performance in the magnitude of runoff 1 5 m3 s 1 day 1 which corresponds to the dry condition and low flow intervals of fdc therefore we plan to conduct a follow up study on the enhancement of the accuracy of smaller daily runoffs by improving the bff and cnn although this study had a limitation and requires follow up research it is believed to have a high utility value because the proposed method has advantages such as the ability to perform daily runoff simulation using two types of features the ability to reflect topographical conditions and applicability to the fields of remote sensing and satellite imaging declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
3727,groundwater influences the water and carbon cycle by supplying moisture to plants in the semi arid and arid zones however little is known about the response of ecosystem water use efficiency wue to climate change in different groundwater depth gd sections recent research has shown that plant photosynthesis and growth are closely related to gd via field experiments but the wider recognition of gd effect on regional scale ecosystems has not been yet established in this study we test whether the gd has an impact on ecosystem wue and its variability to climate change at the regional scale based on the observed data of nearly 3000 wells meteorological data precipitation and pan evaporation and the 0 01 resolution remote sensing datasets including gross primary production gpp evapotranspiration et and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi we explored the spatio temporal variations of wue and its composites i e gpp and et and their characteristics depending on gd under different aridity conditions and biomes across the ordos plateau a semi arid to arid area in northern china results show that wue increases with decreasing gd due to water availability in the semi arid lands where wue variability is mainly regulated by biological processes i e gpp while wue is insensitive to the changes in gd across the arid zone where the physical processes i e et control wue change however when drought happens the groundwater independent vegetation in the arid zone can also utilize groundwater characterized by lower reductions of gpp with the decrease in gd a dense vegetation condition i e large ndvi is more vulnerable to climatic disturbance over the semi arid zone because it tends to decrease gpp and wue especially in the large gd regions these findings have important implications for reasonable land use and groundwater management over the semi arid and arid regions keywords water use efficiency gross primary production groundwater depth drought ordos plateau 1 introduction water is the main limiting factor for plant growth bunting et al 2017 fensholt et al 2009 and hence the ecosystems are particularly vulnerable to climate change in the semi arid and arid regions which account for 40 of land area globally parsons and abrahams 1994 and have experienced the largest expansion over the past 60 years huang et al 2016 across the semi arid and arid areas precipitation is limited while radiation is abundant bunting et al 2017 newman et al 2006 groundwater is therefore a primary moisture supply for evapotranspiration i e et yeh and famiglietti 2009 which can affect the soil moisture variability yeh and eltahir 1998 and further affect the vegetation patterns and dynamics lowry et al 2011 zhu et al 2015a understanding the groundwater role in the spatio temporal variations of semi arid ecosystems is a crucial aspect for the management in water resources and ecosystem services the gross primary production gpp of vegetation is controlled by water availability walther et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 globally it shows an increasing trend along precipitation gradients from deserts to grasslands wetlands and forests turner et al 2006 for the groundwater dependent ecosystems gdes gpp was found to be decreased significantly with the increasing groundwater depth gd based on field studies liu et al 2017 zolfaghar et al 2014 because it is harder for vegetation to utilize groundwater to escape water stress with increasing gd soylu et al 2014 while vegetation can easily facilitate its production through the hydraulic lift with shallower gd ludwig et al 2004 however the focus is mainly on a local scale for typical community ecology griebler et al 2014 the impact of gd on gpp at the larger regional scale is still not known due to the discrepancy among gd measurements and models water use efficiency wue defined as the amount of carbon gain per unit of water consumption is an important indicator of the response of ecosystem gpp to water availability in the carbonassimilation process of plant photosynthesis liu et al 2015 scott et al 2010 recent research has shown that the ecosystem wue is mainly influenced bybiotic e g vegetation types leaf area index and abiotic factors such as climate e g precipitation air temperature t air and soil moisture through effects on canopy conductance and energy partitioning liu et al 2015 tong et al 2014 precipitation is the major controlling meteorological factor of wue by directly influencing et and indirectly influencing the plant carbon uptake via regulating the soil moisture reichstein et al 2002 zhang et al 2016 previous studies on wue variation to precipitation found that the energy limited humid regions have a higher wue than that in the water limited semi arid and arid climate zones sharma and goyal 2018 zhao et al 2020 which can be attributed to the lower water availability for the physical processes of gpp and et kim et al 2021 soil moisture can strongly impact ecosystem wue through water carbon and energy trade between the land surface and atmosphere humphrey et al 2021 because soil moisture deficit has been verified to result in decreased photosynthesis and net primary productivity novick et al 2016 at the leaf level lower relative humidity with a low water supply can cause lower wue due to a higher vapor pressure deficit between the leaf and atmosphere soylu et al 2014 for the gdes in the semi arid to arid ecosystem the change in gd can alter the ecosystem water balance like soil water yao et al 2018 and consequently leading to shifts in wue for semi arid to arid vegetation sommer and froend 2014 previous studies on relations between wue and gd mainly focused on field scale for typical species chen et al 2006 found the growth condition and photosynthetic characterization of populus euphratica were closely related to gd in northwest china populus euphratica will improve the transpirationto dissipate heat at the cost of low wue exposed to water deficit at large gd zones zhou et al 2010 in general wue shows decreasing trend along a gradient of increasinggd liu et al 2017 zolfaghar et al 2014 probably triggered by the distinction in vegetation composition and inter specific competition under different gd zones in shallow groundwater environments the vegetation community with higher wue is bound to contain more functional groups in which species have niche complementarity liu et al 2017 nevertheless except for these limited experimental studies the quantitative relationship between the gd and wue at the regional scale is still unclear chen et al 2011 si et al 2015 as the extreme drought is projected to occur more frequently with more severe intensity under the continuing climate warming which has profound impacts on the coupled carbon and water cycles the enhanced understanding of the relations between wue and drought occurrence can benefit the prediction of ecosystem responses to climate changes dai 2013 trenberth et al 2014 ipcc 2013 several studies have indicated that the responses of wue to drought are different in terms of biomes tian et al 2011 drought intensities medrano et al 2009 and soil properties huang et al 2017 yang et al 2016a different biomes have unique physiological and structural features to prevent water losses during drought van der molen et al 2011 in general vegetation tends to enhance its wue to resist drought liu et al 2018 ponce campos et al 2013 but wue may not always monotonously increase with the water stress lu and zhuang 2010 under severe drought conditions wue can be reduced medrano et al 2009 rather than increased because of the reduction of stomatal conductance in the weak photosynthetic process flexas and medrano 2002 the ecosystem may even break down if the drought continues as biomes endure significant drought induced mortality breshears et al 2005 under the water limited conditions the soil with a larger plant available water holding capacity pawc i e the difference between the field capacity and wilting point can be filled up with more moisture thus the plants can have a better chance to survive and are less vulnerable to future climate change yang et al 2016b for the gdes an upward flux and higher contribution of groundwater for et have been found to sustain plants during the dry seasons lam et al 2011 miguez macho and fan 2012 also groundwater can support plant photosynthesis lowry and loheide 2010 and help to mitigate decreased gpp associated with drought induced water deficits soylu et al 2014 thus the response of wue i e the ratio of gpp to et to drought should be affected by groundwater it s necessary to interpret the role of groundwater in the wue response to climate changes at the ecosystem level in this study there have two scientific questions as follows 1 how gd influences the spatial pattern of wue and gpp 2 what is the role of gd in the response of wue and gpp to an extreme drought event we selected ordos plateau a semi arid to arid region in inner mongolia of northwestern china as the case study area shallow groundwater here helps maintain higher soil moisture and creates a favorable condition for vegetation growth cheng et al 2013 zhang and wang 2020 and vegetation ecology is sensitive to groundwater li 1990 the most distributed sandy i e xeric and low humidity i e riparian vegetation are phreatophytes because their roots can absorb water directly or indirectly from groundwater to maintain transpiration although their responses to gd are various wang et al 2014 it is not easy to measure the soil moisture at the regional scale so we will utilize the gd data to explore the spatio temporal variations in wue with gd throughout the study area since the nearly 3000 monitoring wells have been measured the study can contribute to the identification of most drought vulnerable regions and highlight the need to take sufficient adaptation measures for ecosystem management to ensure its sustainability during the drought period 2 study area our study area fig 1 is located in the ordos plateau of inner mongolia north china the yellow river encloses the plateau on the west north and east and the tributary hailiutu river and dusitu river are located in the southeast and northwest of the study area respectively the mu us desert mainly covers the central plateau lowlands are mainly near rivers whereas highlands are normally distributed along watershed ridges which are normally below 1200 m and higher than 1300 m respectively the region with an area of nearly 20000 km2 investigated in this study lies in an arid to semiarid climate from west to east the mean annual t air is approximately 9 c and precipitation is ranged from 200 mm to 500 mm xeric plants are the dominant cover including artemisia desertorum salix psammophila and salix matsudana as well as riparian plants such as pastures and high density shrubs the growing season is may to october zhang and wang 2020 the groundwater flow pattern underneath the ordos plateau is dominated by the topographical and hydrogeological conditions hou et al 2008 the unconfined quaternary sandy aquifer has a small thickness 50 m overlying the large thickness semi confined aquifer of the cretaceous sandstones 500 1200 m that is almost fully saturated with groundwater the jurassic mudstone formation below the cretaceous formation acts as the aquitards therefore the zonal groundwater flow forms a wide and deep circulation the shape of the water table is similar to topography surface waters e g rivers streams and lakes are mainly fed by groundwater hou et al 2008 rivers tend to cut deeply into aquifers over the downstream area increasing the gd on the riverbanks in this study area groundwater recharge is mainly contributed by precipitation infiltration whereas groundwater supply for evapotranspiration is the major discharge process 3 materials and methods 3 1 data the datasets consist of meteorological remote sensing topographic and water table data table 1 the abbreviations and meanings of all variables are displayed in table 2 in this study the spatial patterns of wue and its composites i e gpp and et were analyzed across the semi arid arid area their responses to drought depending on gd under different aridity conditions and biomes were then explored we finally discussed the gd role in their patterns filtered from climate and altitude factors and their variabilities under drought 3 1 1 meteorological data the observed meteorological data were available from 5 weather stations i e huinong taole otog banner wushenzhao and hengshan in or near the study area which can reflect the climate conditions across the study area fig 1 monthly precipitation t air and pan evaporation epan data covering the period 2001 2010 were provided by china meteorological administration http data cma cn the epan was observed via a 20 cm diameter pan in each weather station and can be used to estimate the potential evapotranspiration pet with empirical pan coefficient shi et al 1986 3 1 2 remote sensing datasets in this study the remote sensing datasets consist of gpp et pet normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and land use data products the terrestrial gpp product of global mod17a2 datasets was obtained from the nasa earth observation system eos program available from https search earthdata nasa gov which was developed by numerical terradynamic simulation group at university of montana http www ntsg umt edu this product was generated using the mod17 algorithm running et al 2004 zhao et al 2005 and has been validated and widely applied in the domain of ecology li et al 2019 turner et al 2006 wolf et al 2016 xia et al 2015 in this study monthly gpp datasets from 2001 to 2010 at the 0 01 resolution were used et and pet data were both obtained from the global annual mod16a2 product also available from http www ntsg umt edu with a 500 m resolution based on the penman monteith equation mu et al 2011b the algorithm including inputs of modis remote sensing data products and daily reanalysis data has been evaluated velpuri et al 2013 they were extracted monthly at the same spatial resolution with gpp during the period 2001 2010 the spatial et data were corrected based on water balance qi 2017 and the pet data were corrected versus the same grid of the observed epan at the monthly scale the vegetation index used in this study is ndvi provided by mod13q1 version 6 product available from https lpdaac usgs gov products mod13q1v006 didan 2015 the 2001 2010 long term period of mean annual maximum ndvi via maximum value compositing was resampled into the same 0 01 0 01 resolution the classified land cover was collected from the national geomatics center of china http www globeland30 com chen et al 2015 the generated 30 m resolution globeland30 data in 2010 was used to remove the irrigation cover of the study area 3 1 3 dem and groundwater depth the phreatic water table data of 2994 even distributed wells fig 2 a were measured from the hydrogeological field survey from 2005 to 2010 during this period the water table is generally stable at the annual scale thus we assume that gd is an unchangeable variable for each pixel within the study period the 90 m resolution dem produced by nasa available at http www gscloud cn was used to yield gd data through the difference between dem and water table height the interpolated gd data of 0 01 resolution were extracted to represent the distributed mean annual gd across the region during the study period fig 2b 3 2 aridity index the ratio of pet and precipitation known as aridity index ai can express the arid degree at a given location the equation of ai is as follows 1 ai pet p k e pan p where pet is the mean annual growing season pet or the actual evaporation from water surface epan is the mean annual growing season value of pan evaporation k is an empirical coefficient to estimate pet from epan p is the mean annual growing season precipitation k 0 55 is applied in the area according to shi et al 1986 ai is ranged between 0 and 10 in general ai values of 2 5 and 5 refer to the semi arid and arid climatic conditions respectively unep 1992 in this study we calculated the temporal series of ai and identified the extreme drought year based on the mean annual growing season epan and precipitation data averaged from 5 weather stations during 2001 2010 corrected pet of mod16a2 product and precipitation interpolated by the kriging method were applied to compute the spatial grid values of ai fig 2c 3 3 water use efficiency defined as the ratio of carbon in and water loss wue can imply the exchange of carbon and water fluxes between the terrestrial ecosystem and atmosphere jones 2004 the annual growing season wue was calculated at each pixel based on monthly values of modis gpp and et eq 2 we computed the growing season wue for each valid pixel during the study period 2001 2010 ignoring the pixels with the non fill value of gpp and et 2 wue gpp et 3 4 climatic elasticity of wue gpp and et in this study we used the climatic elasticity of wue ε wue to represent the ecosystem response to climate change the main difference that distinguishes the ε wue from the existing ecosystem resilience index liu et al 2019 sharma and goyal 2017 is the use of a ratio of the normalized wue to ai in quantifying the relative change rate which incorporates the drought severity change in the evaluation climatic elasticity of vegetation wue can be defined as the growing season relatively change rate in wue to that in ai during the same period thus we analyzed the climatic elasticity of wue gpp and et to the extreme drought event using a dimensionless resilience index ε as follows 3 ε w u e δ w u e δ a i where δ w u e wu e i wue wue and δ a i a i i ai ai δwue represents the relative change rate in growing season wue at the i th year i e drought event with respect to the mean annual growing season wue denoted as wue the definition of δai is in the same way the definition of ε gpp and ε et is in the same way as ε wue the calculated ε wue was finally compared with gd at each pixel and different gd landscape scale to explore the impacts of groundwater on different ecosystems 3 5 multivariable regression and linear filtering method the multivariable regression method is used to filter the controls of aridity degree and topography on ecosystem wue and gpp from groundwater effects the range of gd that significantly affects the vegetation growth is not 10 m in the ordos plateau lv et al 2013 the cut off point of 15 m was used to divide gd independent and gd dependent vegetation zones zhang and wang 2020 in large gd zones 15 m it is assumed that climatic and topographic factors e g ai tair and dem dominant the wue gpp variation tair and ai are of multicollinearity so we removed the effect of tair the association between wue gpp with ai and dem is described as follows 4 wu e ij a a i ij b z ij w w u e ij for g d ij 15 m 5 gp p ij c a i ij d z ij w g p p ij for g d ij 15 m where i and j denote the column and row for each 0 01 resolution pixel position z represents the altitude m a b c and d are regression coefficients as the stochastic variable wwue and wgpp are the residual wue and gpp values filtered from the multivariable regression in the gd 15 m zone the multivariable regression can be also described as 6 wu e ij a a i ij b z ij w w u e ij for g d ij 15 m 7 gp p ij c a i ij d z ij w g p p ij for g d ij 15 m where the coefficients a b c and d are different from that in eqs 4 and 5 and wwue and wgpp are stochastic variables the regression coefficients difference between eqs 4 7 can indicate the additional impact of gd on wue and gpp 4 results 4 1 spatial distributions of mean annual wue gpp and et fig 3 displays the spatial patterns of mean annual wue gpp and et data wue is generally 1 0 g c kg h2o over the northwestern arid areas linking with lower gpp 190 g c m2 and et 180 mm it indicates that the gpp is constrained by the slow growing stress tolerant plants in lower densities under the arid conditions ehleringer 2001 and the et is limited due to low soil moisture conditions in contrast wue is relatively lower ranging from 0 8 g c kg h2o to 1 0 g c kg h2o in the southeastern more humid areas where gpp and et are higher with 230 g c m2 and 210 mm respectively it implies that natural selections favor high growth rate plants with other competitive abilities rather than elevated wue in the semi arid regions huxman et al 2004 the middle sand zone has the least wue 0 7c kg h2o due to sparse vegetation associated with the relatively low gpp of 150 g c m2 and high et from 180 mm to 210 mm this can be attributed to low leaf area index lai and high elevation and solar radiation which all makes wue decreased zhu et al 2015b the low wue in the middle mu us desert also suggests that the efforts to enhance china s grain to green program should consider the increased carbon sequestration which can unexpectedly result in the ongoing water crisis at those water limited sites sun et al 2006 4 2 regression statistics and distributions of wwue and wgpp the relationship between wue and ai varies in different arid degree zones table 3 for example wue increases with ai in arid areas but decreases in semi arid areas which is the same as the result from yang et al 2016a according to the nonlinear relationship between wue and ai when gd 15 m we divided the study area into three zones ai 4 zone a 4 ai 5 5 zone b and ai 5 5 zone c to obtain the filtered wwue data as for gpp linear regression was applied to obtain the filtered wgpp data across the whole area linear regression standard coefficients of climatic and topographic factors of the wue and gpp data are calculated for two gd zones with eqs 4 and 5 and eqs 6 and 7 table 3 shows that all of the regression coefficients including a d in eqs 4 and 5 and a d in eqs 6 and 7 pass the t test with p value 0 05 and the overall significance passes the f test with p values almost zero although some cross correlation shows weak significance represented by the small r2 which can be ascribed to a large number of data points each formula built on the linear regression relationship is significant the results of wue and gpp statistics in different gd zones reveal that both std and cv of wue and gpp under the gd 15 m zone are apparently larger compared with those under gd 15 m zone table 3 this indicates relatively homogeneous types in vegetation and simple water use strategies for the groundwater independent ecosystems at large gd sites also the regression coefficients of wue with ai and z are quite different under these two gd zones mainly characterized by the higher contribution of z except for the arid zone c it suggests that the groundwater exerts impacts on vegetation within 15 m gd while zone c may not include groundwater dependent ecosystems the regression coefficients of gpp with z are opposite in the two gd zones the positive correlation coefficient of gpp with z in the large gd zone is likely triggered by the elevation effect of precipitation increased with z whereas the correlation coefficient between gpp and z turns negative caused by negative gd effects on biomes in shallow groundwater zone the multivariable linear regressions are applied to filter the background impacts of ai and z to produce the residual vegetation wue and gpp wwue and wgpp as follows 8 w w u e i j w u e i j a a i i j b z i j 9 w g p p i j g p p i j c a i i j d z i j wwue and wgpp are considered as the stochastic variables in the whole study area which incorporates the groundwater behavior within 15 m gd fig 3d e shows the spatial patterns of wwue and wgpp generally the patchy characteristics of wwue and wgpp are similar to those of wue and gpp but the contrast ratio is more significant in some places 4 3 temporal variability of growing season wue during the period 2001 2010 the annual growing season gpp shows an increasing tendency from 140 g c m2 in 2001 to 200 g c m2 in 2010 fig 4 b gpp shows a high correlation with precipitation temporally r2 0 34 p value 0 001 while tair is not the main factor in gpp variability r is close to 0 without passing any significance test thus it can be concluded that the gpp is mostly water controlled over the ordos plateau which is consistent with the findings in loess plateau from feng et al 2013 and zhang et al 2016 the enhanced gpp is closely associated with the lowest value in 2001 which is influenced by the extreme drought event in 2000 with one year time lag to take effect on the gpp change after 2002 the overall gpp is actually decreased slightly 0 5 g c m2 per year due to the decreased precipitation although the effective vegetation restoration project helps increase the gpp the change in annual growing season et can be divided into three stages as follows fig 4c significant decline 2001 2005 growth 2005 2007 and stability 2007 2010 overall et shows a decreasing trend during the 10 year period in the study area due to declined precipitation which is ranged from 248 mm in 2002 to 150 mm in 2005 et is mainly from precipitation in the semi arid and arid areas where the surface runoff is nearly zero so et shows a high correlation with precipitation r2 0 57 p value 0 001 only in the southeastern riparian and northwestern zones et is increased by 0 4 mm per year fig 5 c this is possibly caused by increased gpp fig 5b leading to higher water demand for photosynthesis the wue shows an increasing trend of 0 017c kg h2o per year ranging from 0 64c kg h2o in 2001 to 1 12c kg h2o in 2006 with the mean value of 0 915c kg h2o fig 4a this implies that approximately 0 915 g of co2 can be fixed by vegetation biophysical process for every millimeter of water loss via et in the ordos plateau the overall increasing trend of wue in fig 5a indicates that carbon conservation capacities are improved in most parts of the local vegetation ecosystems generally this overall increase of wue can be explained by the decreased et account for 64 5 and the increased gpp account for 33 8 only in the southwestern parts wue decreases with the same trends of gpp and et suggesting that vegetation is in a degraded state across the whole study area the change in wue is significantly negative to et variability while over the semi arid zone a it is significantly positive to gpp variability fig 5d e it implies that gpp plays an important role in wue change over the semi arid regions rather than the arid zones i e zones b and c in summary the enhanced gpp as well as the improved wue benefits from the grain to green program implementation for terrestrial vegetation restoration jia et al 2014 lv et al 2012 although the climate turns to drier with intensified water stress 4 4 characteristics of ε wue and its composites we use the climatic elasticity in wue denoted by ε wue gpp denoted by ε gpp and et denoted by ε et presented in eq 3 to capture the response of ecosystems to the extreme drought event in 2005 fig 6 in general ε wue is positive across the whole area suggesting that vegetation tends to increase its wue during drought ε gpp and ε et are more negative in the northwestern areas indicating that carbon sequestration and water loss are more compressed over the higher aridity degree areas different climatic ecosystems vary in their responses to drought over the northwestern zones b and c ai 4 primarily covered by zonal xeric plants the arid ecosystem under a long term state of water deficit has adapted to water stressed scenario liu et al 2015 vicente serrano et al 2013 characterized by increased wue to a large extent reichstein et al 2002 ε et shows larger changes than ε gpp meaning that the rising wue is possibly due to larger reductions in stomatal conductance that decreases water loss for et since et dominates the wue change over the arid zone seen in fig 5d e over the middle and southeastern zone a where the surface is mainly covered by more heterogeneous azonal vegetation zhang and wang 2020 ε wue presents larger differences itsuggests that diversity increases the variety of responses to disturbances bernhardt and leslie 2013 in some places the vegetation shows more stable as evident from a little reduction of gpp or even enhanced gpp due to groundwater supply which led to a slight increased wue however the vegetation shows poor adaptability to drought with the decreased wue along the southern boundary areas and the river cutting banks the low soil moisture storage causes the decline of carbon assimilation capacities and active leaf area resulting in large reductions of gpp reichstein et al 2003 the response of et to drought is smaller than that of gpp although it also decreases simultaneously 4 5 variations of ε wue ε gpp and ε et with gd considering the stochastic nature of climatic elasticity in wue gpp and et the 50 ε i e an equivalent value of the average ε variation with an interval of gd was used to explore the relationship between ε and gd data fig 7 it is clear to see that 50 ε wue generally increases with increasing gd with the fluctuation range varying between 0 20 and 0 24 both 50 ε gpp and 50 ε et decrease with increasing gd ranging from 0 2 to 0 1 and 0 4 to 0 3 respectively this indicates that the response of gpp and et to climate change is relatively insensitive in shallow groundwater zone across the whole study area where the higher demand for et can be satisfied by groundwater however in large gd 15 m zone without groundwater access gpp and et all show larger changes across the semi arid to arid areas to further explore the impact of gd on the change in wue in different ai zones we selected the semi arid zone a ai 4 and the arid zones b and c ai 4 to compare the statistical distribution characteristics of εwue εgpp and εet among different gd sections in fig 8 when ai 4 the variance of εwue is larger meaning that the more diverse vegetation has multiple responses to drought it s worthy to note that εwue decreases with the increasing gd because wue is easy to reduce i e εwue tends to be negative in large gd areas caused by large decreases in gpp without groundwater availability fig 8a b similarly εwue almost positive in fig 8d also shows a decreasing trend with increasing gd when ai 4 as opposite from the result from fig 7a this conflicting relation is caused by large gd areas mainly covering the arid zone ai 4 where εwue is higher thus fig 7a contains the disturbing effect of ai fig 8 illustrates that shallow groundwater can enhance the wue in vegetation facing drought with fewer reductions of gpp and et regardless of semi arid groundwater dependent ecosystems or arid groundwater independent ecosystems this implies that those groundwater independent ecosystems in arid lands can also utilize groundwater when drought happens the boxplot in fig 9 depicts the εwue εgpp and εet statistics in different biomes at various gd sections in general they all decrease as ndvi increases for example shrublands with low ndvi 0 2 show the strongest resistance to drought manifested by the largest increased wue and the lowest down of gpp in contrast the resistance of riparian plants with larger ndvi 0 3 to drought is weak gpp tends to reduce significantly resulting in dramatic decreases in wue especially in semi arid lands ai 4 as for a certain range of ndvi εwue generally decreases with increasing gd confirming that wue gpp and et are easier to decline disturbed by drought in large gd areas fig 8 especially for vegetation with higher production overall shallow groundwater favors the stability of shrublands ndvi is relatively lower represented by major increases in wue with minor decreases in gpp and et while the vegetation with higher ndvi is more sensitive to gd and vulnerable to drought represented by little increases or even decreases in wue with large reductions in gpp and et especially over the semi arid lands 5 discussions 5 1 the impact of gd on wwue and wgpp because of the stochastic nature of wwue and wgpp we used 50 w i e an equivalent value of the average w and 90 w for an interval of gd to quantitatively characterize the relationship between wwue and wgpp versus gd data fig 10 in general both wwue and wgpp decrease quickly with increasing gd when it is small 5 m over the semi arid zone a including the hailiutu river basin and the middle mu us desert region with ai 4 fig 10a the result is consistent with the trend for wue and gpp with gd in other semi arid to arid terrestrial ecosystems in northwest china and australia liu et al 2017 zolfaghar et al 2014 more functional groups with niche complementarity can take full advantage of water and increase their wue to a large extent under shallow groundwater conditions liu et al 2017 in contrast both 50 wwue and 90 wwue are insensitive to the changes in gd across the arid zone b fig 10b whether the gd variations are triggered by topography or human activities it indicates that the arid ecosystems wue is possibly groundwater independent similarly the response of wgpp to gd is insensitive in zone b due to the climate dominate distribution of zonal vegetation over the zone c with ai 5 5 wgpp even increases with increasing gd while wwue stays almost unchanged fig 10c suggesting that gpp is not the controlling factor of wue variations in the arid zone 5 2 dominant factor of wue variability the changes in wue are through the alterations in gpp and et simultaneously yang et al 2014 zhao and running 2010 fig 5d indicates that gpp dominants the wue change over the semi arid zone a azonal vegetation depends more seriously on groundwater over this area lv et al 2013 zhang and wang 2020 shallow groundwater can support carbon assimilation and keep the high level stomatal conductance in the response to drought meinzer et al 2016 characterized by lower reductions of gpp and et in many places of zone a fig 6b c therefore water availability plays a dominant role in carbon uptake and wue changes over the semi arid zone a by contrast et shows larger correlation coefficient values for wue variability in more arid regions where ai 4 fig 5e revealing that et controls the wue variability this result is consistent with yang et al 2016a these arid ecosystems strongly favor strict stomatal regulation and will greatly enhance wue and reduce et to water stress for example they will close the stoma exposed to drying climate meinzer et al 2016 regardless of the groundwater conditions overall the relations between moisture availability and stomatal control are most likely associated with climatic aridity degree the trade off of water conservation and plant growth is reflected by many coordinated traits li et al 2018 variations in ε wue fig 6a indicate the difference in the coupling between water and carbon cycles overall among the main responses to the drought vegetation would manage the trade off between optimum carbon gain and water loss through transpiration this usually causes an increase in wue with a concomitant decrease in net photosynthesis i e gpp and stomatal conductance i e et keitel et al 2003 limousin et al 2015 the various responses of wue to drought in different climatic zones illustrate that the semi arid ecosystem controlled by the biological factor i e gpp can be more vulnerable to drought compared with the arid ecosystem controlled by the physical factor i e et which confirms previous findings ponce campos et al 2013 poulter et al 2014 arid ecosystems have adapted to water deficit for a long term chaves et al 2003 vicente serrano et al 2013 and can reduce water loss armstrong et al 2010 photosynthetic activity chen et al 2006 and maximize water uptake jackson et al 2000 through physiological and functional mechanisms armstrong et al 2010 the drought resistant genes can protect the ecosystems against irreversible damage and can also make them recover rapidly from drought disturbances craine et al 2013 zhang et al 2021 5 3 the role of gd in wue and gpp responses to drought water stress is the main limiting factor particularly for the semi arid ecosystem wue it can inhibit vegetation productivity directly or indirectly mu et al 2011a over large gd places vegetation responds to droughts by partially closing stoma to reduce evaporative water loss at the cost of carbon uptake by photosynthesis peters et al 2018 the slow or even suspended processes in photosynthesis transpiration and plant atmosphere gas exchange running and kimball 2005 can consequently result in the decrease of wue over some large gd places under shallow groundwater environments the hydraulic connection between roots and water table can mitigate the stomatal conductance change and hence et and gpp reduction orellana et al 2012 this trade off maximizes ecosystem wue in small gd areas the response of gpp to the change in precipitation depends largely on gd and biomes among the semi arid and arid ecosystems in shallow groundwater conditions ecosystems manage to mitigate adverse effects of water stress on carbon fixation via photosynthesis within groundwater access soylu et al 2014 characterized by a slightly decreased or even increased gpp during the drought year this additional water from shallow groundwater for transpiration can be considered as groundwater subsidy lowry and loheide 2010 the gpp variability with low ndvi is relatively insensitive to interannual variation in precipitation or water availability consistent with paruelo et al 1999 this can be explained by low plant density and leaf area of low ndvi leading to biotically constrained gpp responses knapp and smith 2001 in the arid zone the difference in εgpp among biomes is smaller than that in the semi arid zone due to the homogeneity in vegetation types zhang and wang 2020 all in all different ecosystems under different groundwater conditions have various sensitivities to climate changes since the larger gd and ndvi are the weaker resistance ability of vegetation to drought is particularly over the semi arid regions it is not suitable for planting high coverage vegetation in this zone with large gd or low soil moisture let alone cultivation that has larger water demand also we suggest exploiting groundwater reasonably in the semi arid hailiutu river basin because a drawdown of the water table would cause a reduction of carbon fixation and wue in this zone in contrast the arid ecosystems can increase wue to a larger extent and decrease gpp to a limited degree regardless of gd conditions therefore groundwater resources utilized for agricultural development in the arid dusitu river basin are more feasible for economic benefits we should also consider the inter basin groundwater flow because they belong to the same regional aquifer system excessively exploiting groundwater may result in ecosystem degradation in any zone 6 conclusion in this study we highlighted the groundwater depth gd role in spatial variations of water use efficiency wue and its composites i e gross primary production denoted by gpp and evapotranspiration denoted by et and the responses of water and carbon circulation in ecosystems to an extreme drought event in the ordos plateau china based on 0 01 resolution datasets of wue gpp et gd and aridity index ai the filtered wue w wue and gpp w gpp via the linear regression method were used to explore the gd effect in their spatial patterns climatic elasticity in wue εwue gpp εgpp and et εet were used to represent the ecosystem responses to an extreme drought depending on gd the major conclusions of this study are as follows 1 gd plays an important role in spatial variations of wue and gpp in the semi arid lands ai 4 where they all increase with decreasing gd because of water availability in contrast both wue and gpp are insensitive to the changes in gd across the arid zone where ai 4 2 in the semi arid regions wue variability is mainly regulated by biological processes i e the change in gpp while in the arid zones physical processes i e the change in et are the controlling factor in wue change 3 shallow groundwater contributes to larger increased wue and lower reductions of gpp and et regardless of semi arid or arid ecosystems when the drought happens indicating that the groundwater independent vegetation can also utilize shallow groundwater exposed to water stress 4 the vegetation with high coverage i e large ndvi value regions is more vulnerable to climatic disturbances over the semi arid zones characterized by large reductions of gpp and consequently decreased wue especially in large gd regions credit

3727,groundwater influences the water and carbon cycle by supplying moisture to plants in the semi arid and arid zones however little is known about the response of ecosystem water use efficiency wue to climate change in different groundwater depth gd sections recent research has shown that plant photosynthesis and growth are closely related to gd via field experiments but the wider recognition of gd effect on regional scale ecosystems has not been yet established in this study we test whether the gd has an impact on ecosystem wue and its variability to climate change at the regional scale based on the observed data of nearly 3000 wells meteorological data precipitation and pan evaporation and the 0 01 resolution remote sensing datasets including gross primary production gpp evapotranspiration et and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi we explored the spatio temporal variations of wue and its composites i e gpp and et and their characteristics depending on gd under different aridity conditions and biomes across the ordos plateau a semi arid to arid area in northern china results show that wue increases with decreasing gd due to water availability in the semi arid lands where wue variability is mainly regulated by biological processes i e gpp while wue is insensitive to the changes in gd across the arid zone where the physical processes i e et control wue change however when drought happens the groundwater independent vegetation in the arid zone can also utilize groundwater characterized by lower reductions of gpp with the decrease in gd a dense vegetation condition i e large ndvi is more vulnerable to climatic disturbance over the semi arid zone because it tends to decrease gpp and wue especially in the large gd regions these findings have important implications for reasonable land use and groundwater management over the semi arid and arid regions keywords water use efficiency gross primary production groundwater depth drought ordos plateau 1 introduction water is the main limiting factor for plant growth bunting et al 2017 fensholt et al 2009 and hence the ecosystems are particularly vulnerable to climate change in the semi arid and arid regions which account for 40 of land area globally parsons and abrahams 1994 and have experienced the largest expansion over the past 60 years huang et al 2016 across the semi arid and arid areas precipitation is limited while radiation is abundant bunting et al 2017 newman et al 2006 groundwater is therefore a primary moisture supply for evapotranspiration i e et yeh and famiglietti 2009 which can affect the soil moisture variability yeh and eltahir 1998 and further affect the vegetation patterns and dynamics lowry et al 2011 zhu et al 2015a understanding the groundwater role in the spatio temporal variations of semi arid ecosystems is a crucial aspect for the management in water resources and ecosystem services the gross primary production gpp of vegetation is controlled by water availability walther et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 globally it shows an increasing trend along precipitation gradients from deserts to grasslands wetlands and forests turner et al 2006 for the groundwater dependent ecosystems gdes gpp was found to be decreased significantly with the increasing groundwater depth gd based on field studies liu et al 2017 zolfaghar et al 2014 because it is harder for vegetation to utilize groundwater to escape water stress with increasing gd soylu et al 2014 while vegetation can easily facilitate its production through the hydraulic lift with shallower gd ludwig et al 2004 however the focus is mainly on a local scale for typical community ecology griebler et al 2014 the impact of gd on gpp at the larger regional scale is still not known due to the discrepancy among gd measurements and models water use efficiency wue defined as the amount of carbon gain per unit of water consumption is an important indicator of the response of ecosystem gpp to water availability in the carbonassimilation process of plant photosynthesis liu et al 2015 scott et al 2010 recent research has shown that the ecosystem wue is mainly influenced bybiotic e g vegetation types leaf area index and abiotic factors such as climate e g precipitation air temperature t air and soil moisture through effects on canopy conductance and energy partitioning liu et al 2015 tong et al 2014 precipitation is the major controlling meteorological factor of wue by directly influencing et and indirectly influencing the plant carbon uptake via regulating the soil moisture reichstein et al 2002 zhang et al 2016 previous studies on wue variation to precipitation found that the energy limited humid regions have a higher wue than that in the water limited semi arid and arid climate zones sharma and goyal 2018 zhao et al 2020 which can be attributed to the lower water availability for the physical processes of gpp and et kim et al 2021 soil moisture can strongly impact ecosystem wue through water carbon and energy trade between the land surface and atmosphere humphrey et al 2021 because soil moisture deficit has been verified to result in decreased photosynthesis and net primary productivity novick et al 2016 at the leaf level lower relative humidity with a low water supply can cause lower wue due to a higher vapor pressure deficit between the leaf and atmosphere soylu et al 2014 for the gdes in the semi arid to arid ecosystem the change in gd can alter the ecosystem water balance like soil water yao et al 2018 and consequently leading to shifts in wue for semi arid to arid vegetation sommer and froend 2014 previous studies on relations between wue and gd mainly focused on field scale for typical species chen et al 2006 found the growth condition and photosynthetic characterization of populus euphratica were closely related to gd in northwest china populus euphratica will improve the transpirationto dissipate heat at the cost of low wue exposed to water deficit at large gd zones zhou et al 2010 in general wue shows decreasing trend along a gradient of increasinggd liu et al 2017 zolfaghar et al 2014 probably triggered by the distinction in vegetation composition and inter specific competition under different gd zones in shallow groundwater environments the vegetation community with higher wue is bound to contain more functional groups in which species have niche complementarity liu et al 2017 nevertheless except for these limited experimental studies the quantitative relationship between the gd and wue at the regional scale is still unclear chen et al 2011 si et al 2015 as the extreme drought is projected to occur more frequently with more severe intensity under the continuing climate warming which has profound impacts on the coupled carbon and water cycles the enhanced understanding of the relations between wue and drought occurrence can benefit the prediction of ecosystem responses to climate changes dai 2013 trenberth et al 2014 ipcc 2013 several studies have indicated that the responses of wue to drought are different in terms of biomes tian et al 2011 drought intensities medrano et al 2009 and soil properties huang et al 2017 yang et al 2016a different biomes have unique physiological and structural features to prevent water losses during drought van der molen et al 2011 in general vegetation tends to enhance its wue to resist drought liu et al 2018 ponce campos et al 2013 but wue may not always monotonously increase with the water stress lu and zhuang 2010 under severe drought conditions wue can be reduced medrano et al 2009 rather than increased because of the reduction of stomatal conductance in the weak photosynthetic process flexas and medrano 2002 the ecosystem may even break down if the drought continues as biomes endure significant drought induced mortality breshears et al 2005 under the water limited conditions the soil with a larger plant available water holding capacity pawc i e the difference between the field capacity and wilting point can be filled up with more moisture thus the plants can have a better chance to survive and are less vulnerable to future climate change yang et al 2016b for the gdes an upward flux and higher contribution of groundwater for et have been found to sustain plants during the dry seasons lam et al 2011 miguez macho and fan 2012 also groundwater can support plant photosynthesis lowry and loheide 2010 and help to mitigate decreased gpp associated with drought induced water deficits soylu et al 2014 thus the response of wue i e the ratio of gpp to et to drought should be affected by groundwater it s necessary to interpret the role of groundwater in the wue response to climate changes at the ecosystem level in this study there have two scientific questions as follows 1 how gd influences the spatial pattern of wue and gpp 2 what is the role of gd in the response of wue and gpp to an extreme drought event we selected ordos plateau a semi arid to arid region in inner mongolia of northwestern china as the case study area shallow groundwater here helps maintain higher soil moisture and creates a favorable condition for vegetation growth cheng et al 2013 zhang and wang 2020 and vegetation ecology is sensitive to groundwater li 1990 the most distributed sandy i e xeric and low humidity i e riparian vegetation are phreatophytes because their roots can absorb water directly or indirectly from groundwater to maintain transpiration although their responses to gd are various wang et al 2014 it is not easy to measure the soil moisture at the regional scale so we will utilize the gd data to explore the spatio temporal variations in wue with gd throughout the study area since the nearly 3000 monitoring wells have been measured the study can contribute to the identification of most drought vulnerable regions and highlight the need to take sufficient adaptation measures for ecosystem management to ensure its sustainability during the drought period 2 study area our study area fig 1 is located in the ordos plateau of inner mongolia north china the yellow river encloses the plateau on the west north and east and the tributary hailiutu river and dusitu river are located in the southeast and northwest of the study area respectively the mu us desert mainly covers the central plateau lowlands are mainly near rivers whereas highlands are normally distributed along watershed ridges which are normally below 1200 m and higher than 1300 m respectively the region with an area of nearly 20000 km2 investigated in this study lies in an arid to semiarid climate from west to east the mean annual t air is approximately 9 c and precipitation is ranged from 200 mm to 500 mm xeric plants are the dominant cover including artemisia desertorum salix psammophila and salix matsudana as well as riparian plants such as pastures and high density shrubs the growing season is may to october zhang and wang 2020 the groundwater flow pattern underneath the ordos plateau is dominated by the topographical and hydrogeological conditions hou et al 2008 the unconfined quaternary sandy aquifer has a small thickness 50 m overlying the large thickness semi confined aquifer of the cretaceous sandstones 500 1200 m that is almost fully saturated with groundwater the jurassic mudstone formation below the cretaceous formation acts as the aquitards therefore the zonal groundwater flow forms a wide and deep circulation the shape of the water table is similar to topography surface waters e g rivers streams and lakes are mainly fed by groundwater hou et al 2008 rivers tend to cut deeply into aquifers over the downstream area increasing the gd on the riverbanks in this study area groundwater recharge is mainly contributed by precipitation infiltration whereas groundwater supply for evapotranspiration is the major discharge process 3 materials and methods 3 1 data the datasets consist of meteorological remote sensing topographic and water table data table 1 the abbreviations and meanings of all variables are displayed in table 2 in this study the spatial patterns of wue and its composites i e gpp and et were analyzed across the semi arid arid area their responses to drought depending on gd under different aridity conditions and biomes were then explored we finally discussed the gd role in their patterns filtered from climate and altitude factors and their variabilities under drought 3 1 1 meteorological data the observed meteorological data were available from 5 weather stations i e huinong taole otog banner wushenzhao and hengshan in or near the study area which can reflect the climate conditions across the study area fig 1 monthly precipitation t air and pan evaporation epan data covering the period 2001 2010 were provided by china meteorological administration http data cma cn the epan was observed via a 20 cm diameter pan in each weather station and can be used to estimate the potential evapotranspiration pet with empirical pan coefficient shi et al 1986 3 1 2 remote sensing datasets in this study the remote sensing datasets consist of gpp et pet normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and land use data products the terrestrial gpp product of global mod17a2 datasets was obtained from the nasa earth observation system eos program available from https search earthdata nasa gov which was developed by numerical terradynamic simulation group at university of montana http www ntsg umt edu this product was generated using the mod17 algorithm running et al 2004 zhao et al 2005 and has been validated and widely applied in the domain of ecology li et al 2019 turner et al 2006 wolf et al 2016 xia et al 2015 in this study monthly gpp datasets from 2001 to 2010 at the 0 01 resolution were used et and pet data were both obtained from the global annual mod16a2 product also available from http www ntsg umt edu with a 500 m resolution based on the penman monteith equation mu et al 2011b the algorithm including inputs of modis remote sensing data products and daily reanalysis data has been evaluated velpuri et al 2013 they were extracted monthly at the same spatial resolution with gpp during the period 2001 2010 the spatial et data were corrected based on water balance qi 2017 and the pet data were corrected versus the same grid of the observed epan at the monthly scale the vegetation index used in this study is ndvi provided by mod13q1 version 6 product available from https lpdaac usgs gov products mod13q1v006 didan 2015 the 2001 2010 long term period of mean annual maximum ndvi via maximum value compositing was resampled into the same 0 01 0 01 resolution the classified land cover was collected from the national geomatics center of china http www globeland30 com chen et al 2015 the generated 30 m resolution globeland30 data in 2010 was used to remove the irrigation cover of the study area 3 1 3 dem and groundwater depth the phreatic water table data of 2994 even distributed wells fig 2 a were measured from the hydrogeological field survey from 2005 to 2010 during this period the water table is generally stable at the annual scale thus we assume that gd is an unchangeable variable for each pixel within the study period the 90 m resolution dem produced by nasa available at http www gscloud cn was used to yield gd data through the difference between dem and water table height the interpolated gd data of 0 01 resolution were extracted to represent the distributed mean annual gd across the region during the study period fig 2b 3 2 aridity index the ratio of pet and precipitation known as aridity index ai can express the arid degree at a given location the equation of ai is as follows 1 ai pet p k e pan p where pet is the mean annual growing season pet or the actual evaporation from water surface epan is the mean annual growing season value of pan evaporation k is an empirical coefficient to estimate pet from epan p is the mean annual growing season precipitation k 0 55 is applied in the area according to shi et al 1986 ai is ranged between 0 and 10 in general ai values of 2 5 and 5 refer to the semi arid and arid climatic conditions respectively unep 1992 in this study we calculated the temporal series of ai and identified the extreme drought year based on the mean annual growing season epan and precipitation data averaged from 5 weather stations during 2001 2010 corrected pet of mod16a2 product and precipitation interpolated by the kriging method were applied to compute the spatial grid values of ai fig 2c 3 3 water use efficiency defined as the ratio of carbon in and water loss wue can imply the exchange of carbon and water fluxes between the terrestrial ecosystem and atmosphere jones 2004 the annual growing season wue was calculated at each pixel based on monthly values of modis gpp and et eq 2 we computed the growing season wue for each valid pixel during the study period 2001 2010 ignoring the pixels with the non fill value of gpp and et 2 wue gpp et 3 4 climatic elasticity of wue gpp and et in this study we used the climatic elasticity of wue ε wue to represent the ecosystem response to climate change the main difference that distinguishes the ε wue from the existing ecosystem resilience index liu et al 2019 sharma and goyal 2017 is the use of a ratio of the normalized wue to ai in quantifying the relative change rate which incorporates the drought severity change in the evaluation climatic elasticity of vegetation wue can be defined as the growing season relatively change rate in wue to that in ai during the same period thus we analyzed the climatic elasticity of wue gpp and et to the extreme drought event using a dimensionless resilience index ε as follows 3 ε w u e δ w u e δ a i where δ w u e wu e i wue wue and δ a i a i i ai ai δwue represents the relative change rate in growing season wue at the i th year i e drought event with respect to the mean annual growing season wue denoted as wue the definition of δai is in the same way the definition of ε gpp and ε et is in the same way as ε wue the calculated ε wue was finally compared with gd at each pixel and different gd landscape scale to explore the impacts of groundwater on different ecosystems 3 5 multivariable regression and linear filtering method the multivariable regression method is used to filter the controls of aridity degree and topography on ecosystem wue and gpp from groundwater effects the range of gd that significantly affects the vegetation growth is not 10 m in the ordos plateau lv et al 2013 the cut off point of 15 m was used to divide gd independent and gd dependent vegetation zones zhang and wang 2020 in large gd zones 15 m it is assumed that climatic and topographic factors e g ai tair and dem dominant the wue gpp variation tair and ai are of multicollinearity so we removed the effect of tair the association between wue gpp with ai and dem is described as follows 4 wu e ij a a i ij b z ij w w u e ij for g d ij 15 m 5 gp p ij c a i ij d z ij w g p p ij for g d ij 15 m where i and j denote the column and row for each 0 01 resolution pixel position z represents the altitude m a b c and d are regression coefficients as the stochastic variable wwue and wgpp are the residual wue and gpp values filtered from the multivariable regression in the gd 15 m zone the multivariable regression can be also described as 6 wu e ij a a i ij b z ij w w u e ij for g d ij 15 m 7 gp p ij c a i ij d z ij w g p p ij for g d ij 15 m where the coefficients a b c and d are different from that in eqs 4 and 5 and wwue and wgpp are stochastic variables the regression coefficients difference between eqs 4 7 can indicate the additional impact of gd on wue and gpp 4 results 4 1 spatial distributions of mean annual wue gpp and et fig 3 displays the spatial patterns of mean annual wue gpp and et data wue is generally 1 0 g c kg h2o over the northwestern arid areas linking with lower gpp 190 g c m2 and et 180 mm it indicates that the gpp is constrained by the slow growing stress tolerant plants in lower densities under the arid conditions ehleringer 2001 and the et is limited due to low soil moisture conditions in contrast wue is relatively lower ranging from 0 8 g c kg h2o to 1 0 g c kg h2o in the southeastern more humid areas where gpp and et are higher with 230 g c m2 and 210 mm respectively it implies that natural selections favor high growth rate plants with other competitive abilities rather than elevated wue in the semi arid regions huxman et al 2004 the middle sand zone has the least wue 0 7c kg h2o due to sparse vegetation associated with the relatively low gpp of 150 g c m2 and high et from 180 mm to 210 mm this can be attributed to low leaf area index lai and high elevation and solar radiation which all makes wue decreased zhu et al 2015b the low wue in the middle mu us desert also suggests that the efforts to enhance china s grain to green program should consider the increased carbon sequestration which can unexpectedly result in the ongoing water crisis at those water limited sites sun et al 2006 4 2 regression statistics and distributions of wwue and wgpp the relationship between wue and ai varies in different arid degree zones table 3 for example wue increases with ai in arid areas but decreases in semi arid areas which is the same as the result from yang et al 2016a according to the nonlinear relationship between wue and ai when gd 15 m we divided the study area into three zones ai 4 zone a 4 ai 5 5 zone b and ai 5 5 zone c to obtain the filtered wwue data as for gpp linear regression was applied to obtain the filtered wgpp data across the whole area linear regression standard coefficients of climatic and topographic factors of the wue and gpp data are calculated for two gd zones with eqs 4 and 5 and eqs 6 and 7 table 3 shows that all of the regression coefficients including a d in eqs 4 and 5 and a d in eqs 6 and 7 pass the t test with p value 0 05 and the overall significance passes the f test with p values almost zero although some cross correlation shows weak significance represented by the small r2 which can be ascribed to a large number of data points each formula built on the linear regression relationship is significant the results of wue and gpp statistics in different gd zones reveal that both std and cv of wue and gpp under the gd 15 m zone are apparently larger compared with those under gd 15 m zone table 3 this indicates relatively homogeneous types in vegetation and simple water use strategies for the groundwater independent ecosystems at large gd sites also the regression coefficients of wue with ai and z are quite different under these two gd zones mainly characterized by the higher contribution of z except for the arid zone c it suggests that the groundwater exerts impacts on vegetation within 15 m gd while zone c may not include groundwater dependent ecosystems the regression coefficients of gpp with z are opposite in the two gd zones the positive correlation coefficient of gpp with z in the large gd zone is likely triggered by the elevation effect of precipitation increased with z whereas the correlation coefficient between gpp and z turns negative caused by negative gd effects on biomes in shallow groundwater zone the multivariable linear regressions are applied to filter the background impacts of ai and z to produce the residual vegetation wue and gpp wwue and wgpp as follows 8 w w u e i j w u e i j a a i i j b z i j 9 w g p p i j g p p i j c a i i j d z i j wwue and wgpp are considered as the stochastic variables in the whole study area which incorporates the groundwater behavior within 15 m gd fig 3d e shows the spatial patterns of wwue and wgpp generally the patchy characteristics of wwue and wgpp are similar to those of wue and gpp but the contrast ratio is more significant in some places 4 3 temporal variability of growing season wue during the period 2001 2010 the annual growing season gpp shows an increasing tendency from 140 g c m2 in 2001 to 200 g c m2 in 2010 fig 4 b gpp shows a high correlation with precipitation temporally r2 0 34 p value 0 001 while tair is not the main factor in gpp variability r is close to 0 without passing any significance test thus it can be concluded that the gpp is mostly water controlled over the ordos plateau which is consistent with the findings in loess plateau from feng et al 2013 and zhang et al 2016 the enhanced gpp is closely associated with the lowest value in 2001 which is influenced by the extreme drought event in 2000 with one year time lag to take effect on the gpp change after 2002 the overall gpp is actually decreased slightly 0 5 g c m2 per year due to the decreased precipitation although the effective vegetation restoration project helps increase the gpp the change in annual growing season et can be divided into three stages as follows fig 4c significant decline 2001 2005 growth 2005 2007 and stability 2007 2010 overall et shows a decreasing trend during the 10 year period in the study area due to declined precipitation which is ranged from 248 mm in 2002 to 150 mm in 2005 et is mainly from precipitation in the semi arid and arid areas where the surface runoff is nearly zero so et shows a high correlation with precipitation r2 0 57 p value 0 001 only in the southeastern riparian and northwestern zones et is increased by 0 4 mm per year fig 5 c this is possibly caused by increased gpp fig 5b leading to higher water demand for photosynthesis the wue shows an increasing trend of 0 017c kg h2o per year ranging from 0 64c kg h2o in 2001 to 1 12c kg h2o in 2006 with the mean value of 0 915c kg h2o fig 4a this implies that approximately 0 915 g of co2 can be fixed by vegetation biophysical process for every millimeter of water loss via et in the ordos plateau the overall increasing trend of wue in fig 5a indicates that carbon conservation capacities are improved in most parts of the local vegetation ecosystems generally this overall increase of wue can be explained by the decreased et account for 64 5 and the increased gpp account for 33 8 only in the southwestern parts wue decreases with the same trends of gpp and et suggesting that vegetation is in a degraded state across the whole study area the change in wue is significantly negative to et variability while over the semi arid zone a it is significantly positive to gpp variability fig 5d e it implies that gpp plays an important role in wue change over the semi arid regions rather than the arid zones i e zones b and c in summary the enhanced gpp as well as the improved wue benefits from the grain to green program implementation for terrestrial vegetation restoration jia et al 2014 lv et al 2012 although the climate turns to drier with intensified water stress 4 4 characteristics of ε wue and its composites we use the climatic elasticity in wue denoted by ε wue gpp denoted by ε gpp and et denoted by ε et presented in eq 3 to capture the response of ecosystems to the extreme drought event in 2005 fig 6 in general ε wue is positive across the whole area suggesting that vegetation tends to increase its wue during drought ε gpp and ε et are more negative in the northwestern areas indicating that carbon sequestration and water loss are more compressed over the higher aridity degree areas different climatic ecosystems vary in their responses to drought over the northwestern zones b and c ai 4 primarily covered by zonal xeric plants the arid ecosystem under a long term state of water deficit has adapted to water stressed scenario liu et al 2015 vicente serrano et al 2013 characterized by increased wue to a large extent reichstein et al 2002 ε et shows larger changes than ε gpp meaning that the rising wue is possibly due to larger reductions in stomatal conductance that decreases water loss for et since et dominates the wue change over the arid zone seen in fig 5d e over the middle and southeastern zone a where the surface is mainly covered by more heterogeneous azonal vegetation zhang and wang 2020 ε wue presents larger differences itsuggests that diversity increases the variety of responses to disturbances bernhardt and leslie 2013 in some places the vegetation shows more stable as evident from a little reduction of gpp or even enhanced gpp due to groundwater supply which led to a slight increased wue however the vegetation shows poor adaptability to drought with the decreased wue along the southern boundary areas and the river cutting banks the low soil moisture storage causes the decline of carbon assimilation capacities and active leaf area resulting in large reductions of gpp reichstein et al 2003 the response of et to drought is smaller than that of gpp although it also decreases simultaneously 4 5 variations of ε wue ε gpp and ε et with gd considering the stochastic nature of climatic elasticity in wue gpp and et the 50 ε i e an equivalent value of the average ε variation with an interval of gd was used to explore the relationship between ε and gd data fig 7 it is clear to see that 50 ε wue generally increases with increasing gd with the fluctuation range varying between 0 20 and 0 24 both 50 ε gpp and 50 ε et decrease with increasing gd ranging from 0 2 to 0 1 and 0 4 to 0 3 respectively this indicates that the response of gpp and et to climate change is relatively insensitive in shallow groundwater zone across the whole study area where the higher demand for et can be satisfied by groundwater however in large gd 15 m zone without groundwater access gpp and et all show larger changes across the semi arid to arid areas to further explore the impact of gd on the change in wue in different ai zones we selected the semi arid zone a ai 4 and the arid zones b and c ai 4 to compare the statistical distribution characteristics of εwue εgpp and εet among different gd sections in fig 8 when ai 4 the variance of εwue is larger meaning that the more diverse vegetation has multiple responses to drought it s worthy to note that εwue decreases with the increasing gd because wue is easy to reduce i e εwue tends to be negative in large gd areas caused by large decreases in gpp without groundwater availability fig 8a b similarly εwue almost positive in fig 8d also shows a decreasing trend with increasing gd when ai 4 as opposite from the result from fig 7a this conflicting relation is caused by large gd areas mainly covering the arid zone ai 4 where εwue is higher thus fig 7a contains the disturbing effect of ai fig 8 illustrates that shallow groundwater can enhance the wue in vegetation facing drought with fewer reductions of gpp and et regardless of semi arid groundwater dependent ecosystems or arid groundwater independent ecosystems this implies that those groundwater independent ecosystems in arid lands can also utilize groundwater when drought happens the boxplot in fig 9 depicts the εwue εgpp and εet statistics in different biomes at various gd sections in general they all decrease as ndvi increases for example shrublands with low ndvi 0 2 show the strongest resistance to drought manifested by the largest increased wue and the lowest down of gpp in contrast the resistance of riparian plants with larger ndvi 0 3 to drought is weak gpp tends to reduce significantly resulting in dramatic decreases in wue especially in semi arid lands ai 4 as for a certain range of ndvi εwue generally decreases with increasing gd confirming that wue gpp and et are easier to decline disturbed by drought in large gd areas fig 8 especially for vegetation with higher production overall shallow groundwater favors the stability of shrublands ndvi is relatively lower represented by major increases in wue with minor decreases in gpp and et while the vegetation with higher ndvi is more sensitive to gd and vulnerable to drought represented by little increases or even decreases in wue with large reductions in gpp and et especially over the semi arid lands 5 discussions 5 1 the impact of gd on wwue and wgpp because of the stochastic nature of wwue and wgpp we used 50 w i e an equivalent value of the average w and 90 w for an interval of gd to quantitatively characterize the relationship between wwue and wgpp versus gd data fig 10 in general both wwue and wgpp decrease quickly with increasing gd when it is small 5 m over the semi arid zone a including the hailiutu river basin and the middle mu us desert region with ai 4 fig 10a the result is consistent with the trend for wue and gpp with gd in other semi arid to arid terrestrial ecosystems in northwest china and australia liu et al 2017 zolfaghar et al 2014 more functional groups with niche complementarity can take full advantage of water and increase their wue to a large extent under shallow groundwater conditions liu et al 2017 in contrast both 50 wwue and 90 wwue are insensitive to the changes in gd across the arid zone b fig 10b whether the gd variations are triggered by topography or human activities it indicates that the arid ecosystems wue is possibly groundwater independent similarly the response of wgpp to gd is insensitive in zone b due to the climate dominate distribution of zonal vegetation over the zone c with ai 5 5 wgpp even increases with increasing gd while wwue stays almost unchanged fig 10c suggesting that gpp is not the controlling factor of wue variations in the arid zone 5 2 dominant factor of wue variability the changes in wue are through the alterations in gpp and et simultaneously yang et al 2014 zhao and running 2010 fig 5d indicates that gpp dominants the wue change over the semi arid zone a azonal vegetation depends more seriously on groundwater over this area lv et al 2013 zhang and wang 2020 shallow groundwater can support carbon assimilation and keep the high level stomatal conductance in the response to drought meinzer et al 2016 characterized by lower reductions of gpp and et in many places of zone a fig 6b c therefore water availability plays a dominant role in carbon uptake and wue changes over the semi arid zone a by contrast et shows larger correlation coefficient values for wue variability in more arid regions where ai 4 fig 5e revealing that et controls the wue variability this result is consistent with yang et al 2016a these arid ecosystems strongly favor strict stomatal regulation and will greatly enhance wue and reduce et to water stress for example they will close the stoma exposed to drying climate meinzer et al 2016 regardless of the groundwater conditions overall the relations between moisture availability and stomatal control are most likely associated with climatic aridity degree the trade off of water conservation and plant growth is reflected by many coordinated traits li et al 2018 variations in ε wue fig 6a indicate the difference in the coupling between water and carbon cycles overall among the main responses to the drought vegetation would manage the trade off between optimum carbon gain and water loss through transpiration this usually causes an increase in wue with a concomitant decrease in net photosynthesis i e gpp and stomatal conductance i e et keitel et al 2003 limousin et al 2015 the various responses of wue to drought in different climatic zones illustrate that the semi arid ecosystem controlled by the biological factor i e gpp can be more vulnerable to drought compared with the arid ecosystem controlled by the physical factor i e et which confirms previous findings ponce campos et al 2013 poulter et al 2014 arid ecosystems have adapted to water deficit for a long term chaves et al 2003 vicente serrano et al 2013 and can reduce water loss armstrong et al 2010 photosynthetic activity chen et al 2006 and maximize water uptake jackson et al 2000 through physiological and functional mechanisms armstrong et al 2010 the drought resistant genes can protect the ecosystems against irreversible damage and can also make them recover rapidly from drought disturbances craine et al 2013 zhang et al 2021 5 3 the role of gd in wue and gpp responses to drought water stress is the main limiting factor particularly for the semi arid ecosystem wue it can inhibit vegetation productivity directly or indirectly mu et al 2011a over large gd places vegetation responds to droughts by partially closing stoma to reduce evaporative water loss at the cost of carbon uptake by photosynthesis peters et al 2018 the slow or even suspended processes in photosynthesis transpiration and plant atmosphere gas exchange running and kimball 2005 can consequently result in the decrease of wue over some large gd places under shallow groundwater environments the hydraulic connection between roots and water table can mitigate the stomatal conductance change and hence et and gpp reduction orellana et al 2012 this trade off maximizes ecosystem wue in small gd areas the response of gpp to the change in precipitation depends largely on gd and biomes among the semi arid and arid ecosystems in shallow groundwater conditions ecosystems manage to mitigate adverse effects of water stress on carbon fixation via photosynthesis within groundwater access soylu et al 2014 characterized by a slightly decreased or even increased gpp during the drought year this additional water from shallow groundwater for transpiration can be considered as groundwater subsidy lowry and loheide 2010 the gpp variability with low ndvi is relatively insensitive to interannual variation in precipitation or water availability consistent with paruelo et al 1999 this can be explained by low plant density and leaf area of low ndvi leading to biotically constrained gpp responses knapp and smith 2001 in the arid zone the difference in εgpp among biomes is smaller than that in the semi arid zone due to the homogeneity in vegetation types zhang and wang 2020 all in all different ecosystems under different groundwater conditions have various sensitivities to climate changes since the larger gd and ndvi are the weaker resistance ability of vegetation to drought is particularly over the semi arid regions it is not suitable for planting high coverage vegetation in this zone with large gd or low soil moisture let alone cultivation that has larger water demand also we suggest exploiting groundwater reasonably in the semi arid hailiutu river basin because a drawdown of the water table would cause a reduction of carbon fixation and wue in this zone in contrast the arid ecosystems can increase wue to a larger extent and decrease gpp to a limited degree regardless of gd conditions therefore groundwater resources utilized for agricultural development in the arid dusitu river basin are more feasible for economic benefits we should also consider the inter basin groundwater flow because they belong to the same regional aquifer system excessively exploiting groundwater may result in ecosystem degradation in any zone 6 conclusion in this study we highlighted the groundwater depth gd role in spatial variations of water use efficiency wue and its composites i e gross primary production denoted by gpp and evapotranspiration denoted by et and the responses of water and carbon circulation in ecosystems to an extreme drought event in the ordos plateau china based on 0 01 resolution datasets of wue gpp et gd and aridity index ai the filtered wue w wue and gpp w gpp via the linear regression method were used to explore the gd effect in their spatial patterns climatic elasticity in wue εwue gpp εgpp and et εet were used to represent the ecosystem responses to an extreme drought depending on gd the major conclusions of this study are as follows 1 gd plays an important role in spatial variations of wue and gpp in the semi arid lands ai 4 where they all increase with decreasing gd because of water availability in contrast both wue and gpp are insensitive to the changes in gd across the arid zone where ai 4 2 in the semi arid regions wue variability is mainly regulated by biological processes i e the change in gpp while in the arid zones physical processes i e the change in et are the controlling factor in wue change 3 shallow groundwater contributes to larger increased wue and lower reductions of gpp and et regardless of semi arid or arid ecosystems when the drought happens indicating that the groundwater independent vegetation can also utilize shallow groundwater exposed to water stress 4 the vegetation with high coverage i e large ndvi value regions is more vulnerable to climatic disturbances over the semi arid zones characterized by large reductions of gpp and consequently decreased wue especially in large gd regions credit

3728,saline geothermal groundwater is widely distributed in the coastal region of guangdong province china the present study employed hydrogeochemical physical parameters ionic chemistry and trace elements and isotopes h o c and b analyses to delineate the causes and evolution processes of saline thermal groundwater in different aqueous environments from the coastal region geothermal groundwater cold groundwater seawater river water and rainwater the results showed that meteoric water was the primary origin of the geothermal groundwater based on the hydrogeochemical characteristics and tds values the geothermal groundwater can be divided into two groups group a was mainly cl type with tds values ranging from 1961 to 7752 mg l and was located around the coastal area group b was mainly hco3 type which is located in the inland area the hydrogeochemical differences between group a and group b are primarily caused by groundwater rock interactions and mixing with seawater reservoir temperatures were calculated as 127 to 163 c for group a and 81 to 140 c for group b by a quartz geothermometer without steam loss besides the circulation depth of group a 3007 to 4031 m was much deeper than that of group b 711 to 3965 m and cold groundwater 394 to 1656 m the analysis of carbon isotopes δ13c and 14c revealed that the circulation times of group a were older than that of group b furthermore seawater intrusion had a significant influence on group a and the proportions of seawater in group a calculated by cl 4 90 to 49 60 were closed to that by br 7 21 to 53 81

energy sources which are extensively applied in more than 88 countries regions lund and toth 2021 geothermal groundwater as the crucial carrier of geothermal energy has been widely exploited

country with massive energy consumption and therefore it is imperative for china to utilize geothermal resources however due to uneven distribution geology and transport limitations the development and application of geothermal groundwater are restricted since there is a growing demand for the utilization of clean energy more and more attention is paid to the low to medium temperature geothermal groundwater 150 c which is abundant and widely distributed guangdong province is situated in south china and comprises numerous geothermal springs which are primarily low to medium temperature so far 320 geothermal springs have been found in this region and are mainly distributed in the fault zones and are presented into a linear distribution mao et al 2015 yuan 2013 as is well known guangdong province is one of the most developed industrial precincts in china and it is critical to utilize geothermal resources for its development although geothermal resources in guangdong province are abundant the utilization rate is still low recently much more attention has been paid to the geothermal groundwater in this region for its potential to be clean geothermal energy despite this increasing interest only a few researches related to geothermal groundwater in this region are available most of these studies are focused on the hydrogeochemical characteristics and geothermometry of geothermal water in this area by geochemical and isotopic tools chen et al 2016 mao et al 2015 qiu et al 2018 as well as the physical and chemical processes in the geothermal site such as xijiang geothermal field sihu hot spring and xinzhou geothermal field lu and liu 2015 lu et al 2017 mao et al 2021 beyond that the available basic data in this region is very limited and not systematic saline geothermal groundwater with high tds values greater than 1 g l and high cl content values is extensively distributed around the world containing southwestern japan saibi and ehara 2010 southern italy capaccioni et al 2011 turkey magri et al 2012 mexico pinti et al 2019 south chile risacher et al 2011 southwestern china guo et al 2017 the causes for high salinity thermal groundwater include water rock interactions at high temperature lashin et al 2014 mixing with brine vengosh et al 2002 or seawater intrusion chen et al 2016 guangdong is a typical coastal region in china and many saline thermal groundwater samples were located or outcropped in this area however information on saline thermal groundwater in the study area has rarely been described which is essential to make use of the thermal groundwater effectively therefore it is urgent to illuminate the causes and evolution processes of saline thermal groundwater in the study area in this study a systematical geochemical study is carried out to investigate the evolution processes of the geothermal system in guangdong province including the recharge source runoff and drainage of geothermal groundwater circulation depth and age of geothermal groundwater etc furthermore special attention has been focused on the genesis of saline geothermal groundwater towards these aims hydrogeochemical properties multiple stable isotopes h o c and b and geothermometers of geothermal groundwater cold groundwater seawater river water and rainwater are discussed in this paper 2 geological and hydrogeological settings the study area is situated in the west section of the pearl river delta guangdong province south china fig 1 the terrain is tilted from northwest to southeast the northwest part low mountains and hills is about 500 m above sea level m s l while the southeast part with flat topography is about 10 m above m s l a subtropical monsoon climate in the study area with an average annual temperature of 21 9 c the mean annual rainfall of this region is 1300 to 2500 mm while the mean annual evaporation is 1100 to 1600 mm yuan 2013 three stages including geosynclinal phase from pre sinian to silurian paraplatform phase from silurian to middle triassic and active continental margin stage from late triassic to quaternary are the main geological evolution in this region geological survey of guangdong province 1988 during these periods multi stage magma activities are intensive and frequent in this area with granite as the major intrusive rock which accounts for 40 of bedrocks of guangdong province yuan et al 2014b the intrusions of different periods are staggered distribution all of which can be broadly classified into four types including caledonian variscan indosinian yanshanian and himalayan intrusions volcanic rocks were also developed and distributed from proterozoic to quaternary but they are mostly interbedded in strata metamorphic rocks are also distributed widely in addition a small number of ultramafic rocks mafic and alkaline rocks are also found in this region owing to a series of complicated tectonic activities repeated activities of deep faults are common in guangdong province among these two typical deep seated faults with the directions of ne sw and e w are existing in the study area the former includes wuchuan sihui deep fault enping xinfeng deep fault and heyuan large fault while the latter is gaoyao huilai deep fault fig 1 the intensive activities of magma and deep faults provide a favorable reservoir for geothermal resources and significantly impact the regional geothermal systems mao et al 2021 qiu et al 2018 yuan 2013 most thermal springs and geothermal wells distribute in granite edges or around the intersection of faults three hydrostratigraphic groups can be identified based on hydrogeologic studies in our area 1 pore phreatic water in aquifer with loose sediments which primarily consists of medium coarse sand coarse sand and gravel with a sedimentary thickness of 3 to 40 m this sort of groundwater is mainly distributed in the pearl river mountain basins and coastal plains which account for about 20 of the total area 2 karst fissure water in carbonatite this type of groundwater is mostly scattered in conghua zhaoqing gaoming plains and so on 3 bedrock fissure water this type of groundwater can be divided into red bed fissure water magmatic rock fissure water and clastic rock fissure water covering about 80 of the total area and it is the major type of geothermal water chen et al 2016 3 methods 3 1 sampling and experimental analysis a total of 64 water samples containing 52 geothermal groundwater 8 cold groundwater 2 river water 1 rainwater and 1 seawater samples were collected in the study area the unstability hydrochemical parameters such as ph temperature t electrical conductivity ec and redox potential orp were measured in the field by a multi parameter water quality analyzer 520 m 01a thermo

are calculated based on the half life formula 1 of radioactive 14c 1 t τ log 2 log a 0 a τ where τ is the half life of 14c with a value of 5730 yr a0 is the initial concentration of 14c in groundwater samples qiu et al 2018 at is the residual concentration of 14c in groundwater samples which obtained from the measurement data however due to the existence of dead carbon it refers to the inactive carbon that has been buried for a long time and the content of 14c has decayed to 0 which can exchange with dissolved inorganic carbon dic of the groundwater and then affect the calculation of groundwater ages fontes and garnier 1979 therefore it is necessary to correct the apparent groundwater ages there are many models used to correct groundwater ages in the 14c dating method such as vogel tamers pearson gonfiantinie mook and fonts model mao et al 2018a qiu et al 2018 yuan 2013 in this study six different correction models mentioned above are applied to correct the measured data 3

and non geothermal groundwater the physical and chemical parameters of water samples are listed in table 1 and appendix a the outlet temperature of geothermal groundwater hot springs and geothermal wells varies from 42 0 to 97 5 c while that of non geothermal water cold groundwater river water and seawater ranges from 25 3 to 31 0 c according to mao et al mao et al 2021 groundwater with a temperature lower than 35 c is defined as the non geothermal groundwater in guangdong geothermal system with respect to ph it is circum neutral to alkaline 6 37 to 9 16 mean of 7 41 for geothermal groundwater while that of non geothermal water range from 5 48 to 8 13 mean of 6 58 the total dissolved solids tds of geothermal groundwater 121 to 7752 mg l are obviously higher than that of cold groundwater 18 2 to 383 mg l the tds of seawater is 23899 8 mg l which is the highest of all water samples the contents of major ions such as ca2 mg2 na k hco3 so4 2 and cl in geothermal groundwater are 2 02 1952 02 mg l 0 63 14 mg l 23 31 2079 82 mg l 1 39 125 1 mg l 27 60 276 22 mg l 7 27 1287 13 mg l and 4 08 7069 92 mg l respectively in addition the concentrations of dissolved sio2 in geothermal groundwater vary from 12 5 to 154 39 mg l with an average value of 93 10 mg l while it is at low concentrations with a small variation 1 44 to 30 34 mg l in non geothermal water samples the contents of b li sr f and br in geothermal groundwater vary greatly ranging from 21 14 to 715 57 μg l 24 45 to 5234 41 μg l 39 8 to 30199 μg l 0 23 to 20 27 mg l and 0 02 to 27 5 mg l and they are much higher than that of cold groundwater river water and rainwater chemical compositions of geothermal and non geothermal water are plotted in the piper diagram fig 2 it shows that the hydrogeochemical types of geothermal water samples in this region are complicated including ca na cl na ca cl na cl na hco3 na hco3 so4 na cl hco3 ca so4 and so on based on the major anion contents geothermal groundwater samples can be classified into two main types as cl type and hco3 type the non geothermal water cold groundwater river water rainwater and seawater types are also complicated containing ca hco3 na ca hco3 na hco3 na ca hco3 cl ca na cl hco3 ca cl hco3 ca na cl na cl and so on remarkably all most cl type geothermal groundwater samples 30 out of 32 belong to saline geothermal groundwater with an abnormally high content of cl from 704 4 to 7069 9 mg l and the tds values of these samples range from 1961 to 7752 mg l with a mean value of 5233 mg l for convenience saline geothermal groundwater samples are named group a the tds values greater than 1 g l and the cl content values more than 700 mg l and the other geothermal groundwater samples are named group b hereafter 4 2 h and o isotopic composition the δ2h and δ18o values vs smow of geothermal groundwater group a and b and non thermal water were also listed in table 1 and appendix a it presented that the δ2h and δ18o values in group a ranged from 47 2 to 38 0 and 7 3 to 2 9 and the δ2h and δ18o values in group b varied from 51 4 to 36 0 and 7 3 to 5 6 respectively the averages of δ2h and δ18o for group a were 41 6 and 5 5 which were slightly higher than those of group b average of 43 5 and 6 6 respectively the δ2h and δ18o values for cold groundwater varied from 49 0 to 29 9 and 7 4 to 3 9 with a mean value of 42 5 and 6 1 which were similar to those of group b compared to that of river water samples which had an average value of 38 6 and 5 5 for δ2h and δ18o respectively the geothermal and cold groundwater were relatively enriched in light h and o isotopes moreover the δ2h and δ18o value in the rainwater sample was of 19 5 and 3 3 which was more enriched in heavy h and o isotopes the highest δ2h and δ18o values were appeared in the seawater sample 7 9 and 1 4 the recharge elevation calculated using equation 2 showed that group a ranged from 645 to 1105 m with an average value of 921 m for group b the recharge elevation varied from 435 to 1205 m and the mean value was 842 m which was close to that of cold groundwater range from 535 to 1510 m with a mean value of 844 m 4 3 13c and 14c isotopic composition the results of δ13c and 14c for group a group b and 2 cold groundwater samples were listed in table 1 and appendix a the δ13c vs pdb and 14c vs pmc values of group a varied from 14 87 to 7 47 and 3 53 to 26 17 with an average value of 10 96 and 13 18 compared to group a the average δ13c and 14c values for group b were relatively higher 8 50 for δ13c and 14 83 for 14c and the δ13c and 14c values of the two cold groundwater samples c1 and c8 differed greatly 17 82 and 32 68 c1 7 67 and 7 39 c8 the apparent groundwater ages were calculated based on the half life formula 1 of radioactive 14c it showed that the apparent ages of geothermal groundwater vary from 6530 to 28910 yr bp with a mean value of 17015 yr bp and the two cold groundwater samples were of 6690 and 18990 yr bp respectively 4 4 11b isotopic composition the δ11b values of 29 geothermal groundwater samples varied from 8 41 to 39 70 with an average value of 7 34 while the δ11b ratios of two cold groundwater samples were close 26 73 and 26 26 respectively table 1 and appendix a it was worth noting that b isotopic values of group a ranged from 0 30 to 39 70 much higher than those in group b from 8 41 to 3 65 4 5 the mixing ratios of seawater in thermal groundwater according to equation 4 the contributions of seawater to geothermal groundwater are calculated using cl and br concentrations fig 3 4 6 geothermometry kinds of geothermometers had been used to estimate geothermal reservoir temperatures liu et al 2019 mao et al 2015 mao et al 2021 wang et al 2015 on the basis of the chemical or isotopic composition of geothermal groundwater among these the cation such as na k ca na k ca mg na k k mg na li et al and silica chalcedony quartz amorphous silica et al geothermometers are widely applied nevertheless different geothermometers have their corresponding conditions concerned for example na k geothermometer is usually applied in geothermal water above 180 c while na k ca mg and silica based geothermometers are suitable for low temperature geothermal water in calcium rich groundwater the na k ca geothermometer is commonly used however the application of cation geothermometers is based on the equilibrium between solution and specific mineral reactions in a geothermal reservoir usually giggenbach s na k mg ternary diagram giggenbach et al 1988 is used to identify the equilibrium state of water rock reactions in geothermal reservoirs and then to determine whether the application of cation geothermometers is reliable fig 4 it was found that almost all geothermal groundwater samples were distributed in the immature waters area and partially equilibrated or mixed waters area meaning that the geothermal groundwater samples have not reached water rock equilibrium the cation geothermometers are thus not appropriate to estimate the geothermal reservoir temperature of this region under disequilibrium conditions silica geothermometers may be more suitable three silica geothermometers containing a chalcedony geothermometer and two quartz geothermometers with or without steam loss were applied to estimate the geothermal reservoir temperatures table 2 chalcedony temperatures were lower than those obtained from the quartz with or without steam loss geothermometers and closed to the outlet temperature of the thermal groundwater due to heat energy loss or mixing of geothermal and cold groundwater during upwards movement of geothermal groundwater the geothermal reservoir temperatures should be higher than that of outlet temperature wang et al 2015 in addition the na k geothermometers temperatures are commonly used to estimate the deep geothermal reservoir temperatures qi et al 2017 wang and zheng 2019 thus geothermal reservoir temperatures should be theoretically between the outlet temperature and na k geothermometer temperature and should be more approximate to the deep geothermal reservoir temperatures therefore the quartz geothermometers were more suitable than that of the chalcedony geothermometer in this study area moreover the outcropping temperatures of thermal groundwater were less than 100 c in this study region thus the quartz geothermometer with steam loss thus was not appropriate based on the above discussion a quartz geothermometer without a steam loss was most suitable for the evaluation of geothermal reservoir temperatures the results showed that the reservoir temperature for group a ranged from 127 to 163 c with an average value of 140 c that was higher than that of group b with a mean value of 118 c and varied from 81 to 140 c fig 5 a and 5b 5 discussion 5 1 the origin of geothermal groundwater the stable isotopes of 2h and 18o of geothermal and non geothermal groundwater are usually used as a powerful trace to identify the origin water rock interactions and distribution of groundwater chen et al 2016 qiu et al 2018 yuan et al 2018 relationships of δ2h and δ18o in geothermal and non geothermal water samples are plotted in fig 6 it showed that all groundwater geothermal and non geothermal groundwater and surface water samples river water rainwater and seawater were located around the global meteoric water line gmwl craig 1961 and the local meteoric water line lmwl yuan 2013 indicating that meteoric water was the main recharge source of groundwater furthermore surface water samples river water and rainwater were closely situated in the bottom right corner of the gmwl suggesting that evaporation had an effect on these samples qiu et al 2018 beyond that there was an apparent stratification between group a and group b for group a the δ18o shifts to the right of gmwl related to group b which could be ascribed to the oxygen isotope exchange reaction of geothermal water samples in group a with the surrounding rocks during the deep circulation or strongly water rock interactions at high temperatures remarkably though the distribution of samples in group a were scattered most of them were located between cold groundwater and seawater indicating that the mixing of cold groundwater or seawater with geothermal groundwater samples in group a besides the fractionation of h and o stable isotopes in high temperature geothermal systems can be significantly influenced by the strong water rock interaction guo et al 2010 the longer resistance time between thermal groundwater with surrounding rock resulted in the formation of secondary minerals enriched with lighter oxygen in their lattices as well as the elevation effect craig 1961 qiu et al 2018 the value of 2h for thermal groundwater and cold groundwater showed that the recharge elevation of group a 921 m was larger than that of group b 842 m and cold groundwater 844 m according to the recharge elevation of thermal groundwater and hydrogeological conditions of the study area the low mountains and hills were considered to be recharge areas in the northwestern study area which was more than 10 km away from local geothermal fields 5 2 circulation depths and ages of geothermal groundwater the circulation depth of groundwater is a significant hydrogeological parameter that indicates the source and formation mechanism of groundwater and it is also an important factor affecting the reservoir temperature in general the deeper circulation depth of geothermal groundwater leads to higher reservoir temperature the circulation depth of the groundwater in this study was estimated by the reservoir s temperatures that were calculated from the quartz geothermometer on the basis of this estimation it is notable that the averages of circulation depths of group a 3330 m were much deeper than that of group b 2749 m and cold groundwater 880 m the circulation time of geothermal groundwater is also an important parameter which affects the renewal ability of geothermal groundwater in geothermal systems the 14c technique is an extensive application and developed tool for estimating groundwater ages mao et al 2018a qiu et al 2018 comparing the results of geothermal and non thermal groundwater ages of the six models the values of age corrected by vogel and tamers models were similar and they were more reasonable than other models which given older or younger and even unreasonable results in table 3 here the average dating results of vogel and tamers models were taken as the groundwater ages it showed that the ages of geothermal groundwater range from 1441 to 12245 yr bp with a mean value of 7213 yr bp and the ages of this two cold groundwater were 3497and 9012 yr bp respectively fig 7 the ages of thousands of years from the cold groundwater samples could be attributed to the mixing of thermal groundwater for the groundwater sample c1 it was about 100 m away from the xinzhou geothermal field geothermal well which may be affected by the mixing of geothermal water resulting in an increase of the measured age of cold groundwater for the groundwater sample c8 it was located in the wuchuan sihuideepfault which had experienced a deep circulation along the fault and then outcropped on thesurface in the form of spring moreover the previously filed survey showed that there was a thermal spring near sample c8 yuan 2013 however the thermal spring had disappeared when we conducted our field study therefore it was reasonable to presume that the disappeared thermal spring has an influence on the cold spring c8 apart from that previous research of eastern guangdong province had reached similar conclusions mao et al 2018b table a4 significantly the ages of the geothermal groundwater increased from the inland area yangchun to the coastal area guanghai in addition the ages of group b from the 14c results showed a heterogeneous scenario suggesting that the geothermal groundwater in this area was independent and mostly runoff scale of groundwater was limited in other words the geothermal groundwater in this area had experienced a local deep circulation with a short horizontal path 5 3 the major geochemical processes for different geothermal groundwater in the study area br and cl are conservative elements that can be utilized to identify seawater intrusions chen et al 2016 he et al 2018 vengosh et al 2002 wang and jiao 2012 in the present study the concentrations of cl and br in group a were higher than that of group b and group a is mainly distributed in the coastal area while group b was primarily scattered in the inland area fig 8 moreover the contents of cl and br in group a showed an increasing trend from offshore to shore in the same direction this distribution would be attributed to the influence of the hydrogeochemical processes taken in the regional geothermal system generally speaking strong water rock interaction under high temperature longer residence times as well as mixing with seawater were the main salinization processes of geothermal groundwater rodríguez et al 2016 sunan sakti syah alam et al 2019 wang and jiao 2012 zhao et al 2017 for group a the abnormally high concentration of br and cl may be caused by the mixing of the geothermal groundwater with seawater because even geothermal groundwater influenced by magma like those in yangbajing high temperature geothermal systems do not have such high contents of br and cl guo et al 2007 yuan et al 2014a also the process of increasing the concentrations of br and cl by the dissolution of rocks seems slow and thus hco3 rather becomes the main anion in the geothermal waters besides the study area had experienced three times seawater intrusions and most samples of group a were distributed along the coastal zone yuan 2013 as such it was postulated that seawater had a significant impact on the concentrations of major ions in geothermal groundwater samples of group a beyond that the relationships between cl and various ions also supported this statement as shown in fig 9 all geothermal groundwater samples of group a were located between cold groundwater and seawater in addition there were also excellent positive correlations between cl and other ions na so4 and br indicating that seawater would be an important source of cl for group a differently group b presented a remarkably similar trend with cold groundwater implying seawater has no obvious contribution on them moreover it was found that group a with higher cl content greater than19 8 mmol l and up to 199 2 mmol l had lower γna γcl rations that varied from 0 45 mmol l to 1 00 mmol l and closed to that of seawater sample 0 72 mmol l in contrast group b from the inland area with relatively low cl concentration ranged from 0 11 to 12 48 mmol l with an average of 1 66 mmol l had higher γna γcl rations up to 20 85 mmol l fig 10 higher γna γcl rations and low tds in group b can be interpreted by the dissolution of surrounding na bearing minerals such as plagioclase feldspar which has been found in this study area during groundwater circulation and infiltration in the aquifers at high temperatures therefore water rock interaction showed a more substantial influence on the concentrations of ions in group b and cold groundwater compared with that from group a 5 4 extra evidence from b stable isotope for mixing process and b depletion b is a dissolved trace element which is widespread in geothermal groundwater it has two natural stable isotopes 10b and 11b due to the relatively large mass differences and its participation in most biogeochemical processes there is significant b isotopic fractionation during b transformations in a geothermal system which is a useful tool for tracing geochemical processes such as identifying the origins of boron in thermal groundwater the water rock interaction and the mixing of different water types bernard et al 2011 liu et al 2019 purnomo et al 2016 vengosh et al 1991b yuan et al 2014a zhang et al 2015 in addition b and cl are generally considered as conservative elements during groundwater circulation and the contents of b and cl in geothermal groundwater are commonly higher than that in non geothermal water reflecting relatively deep circulation paths and more extensive interaction with host rocks guo et al 2007 liu et al 2020 yuan et al 2014a yuan et al 2019 previous researches have demonstrated that the correlations of b γna γcl γb γcl versus δ11b can be used to identify geochemical processes such as seawater intrusion in geothermal systems aggarwal et al 2000 kakihana et al 1987 leeman et al 2005 nomura et al 1982 oi et al 1993 purnomo et al 2016 there was a significant difference in b and δ11b values between group a and group b in this study reflecting that these two types of geothermal groundwater could undergo two different geochemical processes including mixing with another water end member water rock interaction which was labeled as trend ⅰ and trend ⅱ respectively as presented in fig 11 a group a presented a wide variation of δ11b and a narrow range of 1 b values this can be explained by the mixing process between lower b concentration with lighter δ11b cold groundwater or geothermal water and higher b concentration with heavier δ11b seawater such a scenario was consistent with the results from the h and o isotopes a similar trend was also presented in fig 11b it showed that the γna γcl ratios of the cl type geothermal water including all samples of group a and some of group b were close to that of seawater 0 72 indicating that these samples could be affected by seawater intrusion moreover 1000γb γcl ratios of group a are similar to seawater 0 98 suggesting the mixing between geothermal water and seawater fig 11c significantly similar 1000γb γcl ratios were also found in the northern rift valley and java geothermal systems purnomo et al 2016 vengosh et al 1994 these regions have been confirmed to have a seawater influence which forwardly proves the mixing of solutes through seawater intrusion in samples from group a however both γna γcl and 1000γb γcl ratios of most geothermal groundwater samples in group a were lower than that from the seawater suggesting loss of na and b could be due to another hydrochemical process such as cation exchange and adsorption onto clay minerals aggarwal et al 2000 bernard et al 2011 he et al 2018 kakihana et al 1987 leslie et al 2014 purnomo et al 2016 vengosh et al 1991a vengosh et al 1991b previous studies suggested that during adsorption onto marine and or hydrothermal alteration of clay minerals b will be removed from the water and the water becomes enriched in δ11b he et al 2018 leslie et al 2014 vengosh et al 1994 all geothermal groundwater samples of group a were collected in the coastal area of guangdong where clay minerals especially hydrothermal alteration minerals such as kaolin and chlorite are widespread yuan 2013 as such the b concentration of geothermal groundwater samples from group a could be depleted by the adsorption of clay minerals therefore concentrations of b and δ11b values in the geothermal groundwater in group a were probably controlled by multiple processes including seawater intrusion and adsorption of clay minerals compared with group a samples from group b non saline geothermal water were characterized by lower δ11b values and wider 1 b values the δ11b values of the geothermal waters in group b were much lower than that of the seawater while the γna γcl and γb γcl ratios were significantly higher than that of seawater indicating little or no seawater fraction in geothermal water samples moreover the δ11b values of geothermal water in group b fall into the scope of those for granites 9 7 to 6 8 purnomo et al 2016 vengosh et al 1994 xiao et al 2013 and similar to those for kangding geothermal field yuan et al 2019 which suggested that the b resource in geothermal groundwater is related to the dissolution of granite in addition the 1000γb γcl ratios in the geothermal groundwater of the kangding geothermal field were closed to that of group b fig 11c therefore a conclusion can be made that lower δ11b and b concentrations in the geothermal groundwater of group b were probably controlled by interactions between geothermal waters and host rocks furthermore geothermal groundwater in kangding yangbajing and yangyi geothermal fields have shown similar δ11b values but different 1000b cl ratios to the geothermal groundwater in this study b in geothermal groundwater in yangbajing and yangyi geothermal fields was primarily derived from deep mantle processes but the 1000γb γcl ratios in geothermal groundwater of group b are much lower than them fig 11c consequently it suggested that seawater and deep mantle processes cannot provide abundant b for geothermal groundwater in group b the b and δ11b values in group b were thus mainly contributed by the interaction between the surrounding rocks and groundwater 5 5 quantification of seawater intrusion based on a mass balance model the contributions of seawater to geothermal groundwater were calculated using cl and br concentrations the results indicated that the mixing ratios of seawater calculated by cl were similar to that of br in both group a and group b fig 3 however the influence of seawater on these two types of geothermal groundwater differed greatly as shown in fig 3 the mixing ratios of seawater in group a calculated by cl and br vary from 4 90 to 49 60 and 7 21 to 53 81 respectively in contrast the mixing ratios of seawater in group b less than or equal to 3 60 are much lower than that of group a furthermore in group b the cl type geothermal water has a higher mixing ratio of seawater than that of hco3 type 6 conclusion hydrogeochemistry and isotopes h o c and b have been introduced to unravel the hydrogeochemical evolution of saline geothermal water from the coastal area of guangdong province south china the hydrogeochemical types of water samples in this region were complicated and geothermal groundwater samples were mainly cl type and hco3 type moreover most of the cl type geothermal groundwater belonged to saline geothermal groundwater and these samples were located around coastal regions according to the hydrogeochemical types and tds values the geothermal groundwater was classified into two groups group a was mainly cl type whereas group b was mainly hco3 type the stable isotopes of 2h and 18o revealed that meteoric water was the main recharge source of all geothermal groundwater samples from group a and group b the geothermal reservoir s temperatures were evaluated by using a quartz geothermometer without steam loss the reservoir temperature for group a ranged from 127 to 163 c which was higher than that of group b varies from 81 to 140 c the corresponding circulation depth of group a varied from 3007 to 4031 m which is deeper than that of group b ranging from 711 to 3965 m based on the 14c technique the circulation time of geothermal groundwater ranged from 1441 to 12245 yr bp with a mean value of 7213 yr bp furthermore circulation ages of group b were heterogeneous indicating that the geothermal groundwater in this area was independent and mostly runoff scale of groundwater was limited besides the relationships of cl vs ions and b and its isotopic results show that water rock interactions played an important role in the hydrochemistry of group a and group b moreover group a also presented a signature of seawater intrusion and the mixing ratios of seawater calculated by cl and br ranged from 4 90 to 49 60 and 7 21 to 53 81 respectively credit authorship contribution statement jianfei yuan conceptualization methodology investigation data curation writing original draft fen xu supervision software writing review

3728,saline geothermal groundwater is widely distributed in the coastal region of guangdong province china the present study employed hydrogeochemical physical parameters ionic chemistry and trace elements and isotopes h o c and b analyses to delineate the causes and evolution processes of saline thermal groundwater in different aqueous environments from the coastal region geothermal groundwater cold groundwater seawater river water and rainwater the results showed that meteoric water was the primary origin of the geothermal groundwater based on the hydrogeochemical characteristics and tds values the geothermal groundwater can be divided into two groups group a was mainly cl type with tds values ranging from 1961 to 7752 mg l and was located around the coastal area group b was mainly hco3 type which is located in the inland area the hydrogeochemical differences between group a and group b are primarily caused by groundwater rock interactions and mixing with seawater reservoir temperatures were calculated as 127 to 163 c for group a and 81 to 140 c for group b by a quartz geothermometer without steam loss besides the circulation depth of group a 3007 to 4031 m was much deeper than that of group b 711 to 3965 m and cold groundwater 394 to 1656 m the analysis of carbon isotopes δ13c and 14c revealed that the circulation times of group a were older than that of group b furthermore seawater intrusion had a significant influence on group a and the proportions of seawater in group a calculated by cl 4 90 to 49 60 were closed to that by br 7 21 to 53 81

country with massive energy consumption and therefore it is imperative for china to utilize geothermal resources however due to uneven distribution geology and transport limitations the development and application of geothermal groundwater are restricted since there is a growing demand for the utilization of clean energy more and more attention is paid to the low to medium temperature geothermal groundwater 150 c which is abundant and widely distributed guangdong province is situated in south china and comprises numerous geothermal springs which are primarily low to medium temperature so far 320 geothermal springs have been found in this region and are mainly distributed in the fault zones and are presented into a linear distribution mao et al 2015 yuan 2013 as is well known guangdong province is one of the most developed industrial precincts in china and it is critical to utilize geothermal resources for its development although geothermal resources in guangdong province are abundant the utilization rate is still low recently much more attention has been paid to the geothermal groundwater in this region for its potential to be clean geothermal energy despite this increasing interest only a few researches related to geothermal groundwater in this region are available most of these studies are focused on the hydrogeochemical characteristics and geothermometry of geothermal water in this area by geochemical and isotopic tools chen et al 2016 mao et al 2015 qiu et al 2018 as well as the physical and chemical processes in the geothermal site such as xijiang geothermal field sihu hot spring and xinzhou geothermal field lu and liu 2015 lu et al 2017 mao et al 2021 beyond that the available basic data in this region is very limited and not systematic saline geothermal groundwater with high tds values greater than 1 g l and high cl content values is extensively distributed around the world containing southwestern japan saibi and ehara 2010 southern italy capaccioni et al 2011 turkey magri et al 2012 mexico pinti et al 2019 south chile risacher et al 2011 southwestern china guo et al 2017 the causes for high salinity thermal groundwater include water rock interactions at high temperature lashin et al 2014 mixing with brine vengosh et al 2002 or seawater intrusion chen et al 2016 guangdong is a typical coastal region in china and many saline thermal groundwater samples were located or outcropped in this area however information on saline thermal groundwater in the study area has rarely been described which is essential to make use of the thermal groundwater effectively therefore it is urgent to illuminate the causes and evolution processes of saline thermal groundwater in the study area in this study a systematical geochemical study is carried out to investigate the evolution processes of the geothermal system in guangdong province including the recharge source runoff and drainage of geothermal groundwater circulation depth and age of geothermal groundwater etc furthermore special attention has been focused on the genesis of saline geothermal groundwater towards these aims hydrogeochemical properties multiple stable isotopes h o c and b and geothermometers of geothermal groundwater cold groundwater seawater river water and rainwater are discussed in this paper 2 geological and hydrogeological settings the study area is situated in the west section of the pearl river delta guangdong province south china fig 1 the terrain is tilted from northwest to southeast the northwest part low mountains and hills is about 500 m above sea level m s l while the southeast part with flat topography is about 10 m above m s l a subtropical monsoon climate in the study area with an average annual temperature of 21 9 c the mean annual rainfall of this region is 1300 to 2500 mm while the mean annual evaporation is 1100 to 1600 mm yuan 2013 three stages including geosynclinal phase from pre sinian to silurian paraplatform phase from silurian to middle triassic and active continental margin stage from late triassic to quaternary are the main geological evolution in this region geological survey of guangdong province 1988 during these periods multi stage magma activities are intensive and frequent in this area with granite as the major intrusive rock which accounts for 40 of bedrocks of guangdong province yuan et al 2014b the intrusions of different periods are staggered distribution all of which can be broadly classified into four types including caledonian variscan indosinian yanshanian and himalayan intrusions volcanic rocks were also developed and distributed from proterozoic to quaternary but they are mostly interbedded in strata metamorphic rocks are also distributed widely in addition a small number of ultramafic rocks mafic and alkaline rocks are also found in this region owing to a series of complicated tectonic activities repeated activities of deep faults are common in guangdong province among these two typical deep seated faults with the directions of ne sw and e w are existing in the study area the former includes wuchuan sihui deep fault enping xinfeng deep fault and heyuan large fault while the latter is gaoyao huilai deep fault fig 1 the intensive activities of magma and deep faults provide a favorable reservoir for geothermal resources and significantly impact the regional geothermal systems mao et al 2021 qiu et al 2018 yuan 2013 most thermal springs and geothermal wells distribute in granite edges or around the intersection of faults three hydrostratigraphic groups can be identified based on hydrogeologic studies in our area 1 pore phreatic water in aquifer with loose sediments which primarily consists of medium coarse sand coarse sand and gravel with a sedimentary thickness of 3 to 40 m this sort of groundwater is mainly distributed in the pearl river mountain basins and coastal plains which account for about 20 of the total area 2 karst fissure water in carbonatite this type of groundwater is mostly scattered in conghua zhaoqing gaoming plains and so on 3 bedrock fissure water this type of groundwater can be divided into red bed fissure water magmatic rock fissure water and clastic rock fissure water covering about 80 of the total area and it is the major type of geothermal water chen et al 2016 3 methods 3 1 sampling and experimental analysis a total of 64 water samples containing 52 geothermal groundwater 8 cold groundwater 2 river water 1 rainwater and 1 seawater samples were collected in the study area the unstability hydrochemical parameters such as ph temperature t electrical conductivity ec and redox potential orp were measured in the field by a multi parameter water quality analyzer 520 m 01a thermo the alkalinity of water samples was determined by titration within 24 h using 0 025 n hcl all water samples used for geochemical analyses were filtered using 0 45 μm membrane and collected in pre cleaned polyethylene bottles hdpe water samples for cations analyses trace elements analyses and b isotopes analyses were acidified with ultrapure hno3 to ph 2 water samples for 13c and 14c isotopes analysis were pre treated based on yuan and mao et al mao et al 2018a yuan 2013 anions cl br f and so4 2 and cations k na ca2 mg2 b li sr and si were determined using ion chromatography dx 120 dionex and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy iris intreⅱxsp thermo electron in china university of geosciences wuhan the detection limits of anions and cations were 0 01 mg l and 0 001

mineral deposits research nanjing university with a mean analytical precision better than 0 3 2σ yuan 2013 yuan et al 2014a 3 2 data processing 3 2 1 the geothermal age the apparent groundwater ages are calculated based on the half life formula 1 of radioactive 14c 1 t τ log 2 log a 0 a τ where τ is the half life of 14c with a value of 5730 yr a0 is the initial concentration of 14c in groundwater samples qiu et al 2018 at is the residual concentration of 14c in groundwater samples which obtained from the measurement data however due to the existence of dead carbon it refers to the inactive carbon that has been buried for a long time and the content of 14c has decayed to 0 which can exchange with dissolved inorganic carbon dic of the groundwater and then affect the calculation of groundwater ages fontes and garnier 1979 therefore it is necessary to correct the apparent groundwater ages there are many models used to correct groundwater ages in the 14c dating method such as vogel tamers pearson gonfiantinie mook and fonts model mao et al 2018a qiu et al 2018 yuan 2013 in this study six different correction models mentioned above are applied to correct the measured data 3

and non geothermal groundwater the physical and chemical parameters of water samples are listed in table 1 and appendix a the outlet temperature of geothermal groundwater hot springs and geothermal wells varies from 42 0 to 97 5 c while that of non geothermal water cold groundwater river water and seawater ranges from 25 3 to 31 0 c according to mao et al mao et al 2021 groundwater with a temperature lower than 35 c is defined as the non geothermal groundwater in guangdong geothermal system with respect to ph it is circum neutral to alkaline 6 37 to 9 16 mean of 7 41 for geothermal groundwater while that of non geothermal water range from 5 48 to 8 13 mean of 6 58 the total dissolved solids tds of geothermal groundwater 121 to 7752 mg l are obviously higher than that of cold groundwater 18 2 to 383 mg l the tds of seawater is 23899 8 mg l which is the highest of all water samples the contents of major ions such as ca2 mg2 na k hco3 so4 2 and cl in geothermal groundwater are 2 02 1952 02 mg l 0 63 14 mg l 23 31 2079 82 mg l 1 39 125 1 mg l 27 60 276 22 mg l 7 27 1287 13 mg l and 4 08 7069 92 mg l respectively in addition the concentrations of dissolved sio2 in geothermal groundwater vary from 12 5 to 154 39 mg l with an average value of 93 10 mg l while it is at low concentrations with a small variation 1 44 to 30 34 mg l in non geothermal water samples the contents of b li sr f and br in geothermal groundwater vary greatly ranging from 21 14 to 715 57 μg l 24 45 to 5234 41 μg l 39 8 to 30199 μg l 0 23 to 20 27 mg l and 0 02 to 27 5 mg l and they are much higher than that of cold groundwater river water and rainwater chemical compositions of geothermal and non geothermal water are plotted in the piper diagram fig 2 it shows that the hydrogeochemical types of geothermal water samples in this region are complicated including ca na cl na ca cl na cl na hco3 na hco3 so4 na cl hco3 ca so4 and so on based on the major anion contents geothermal groundwater samples can be classified into two main types as cl type and hco3 type the non geothermal water cold groundwater river water rainwater and seawater types are also complicated containing ca hco3 na ca hco3 na hco3 na ca hco3 cl ca na cl hco3 ca cl hco3 ca na cl na cl and so on remarkably all most cl type geothermal groundwater samples 30 out of 32 belong to saline geothermal groundwater with an abnormally high content of cl from 704 4 to 7069 9 mg l and the tds values of these samples range from 1961 to 7752 mg l with a mean value of 5233 mg l for convenience saline geothermal groundwater samples are named group a the tds values greater than 1 g l and the cl content values more than 700 mg l and the other geothermal groundwater samples are named group b hereafter 4 2 h and o isotopic composition the δ2h and δ18o values vs smow of geothermal groundwater group a and b and non thermal water were also listed in table 1 and appendix a it presented that the δ2h and δ18o values in group a ranged from 47 2 to 38 0 and 7 3 to 2 9 and the δ2h and δ18o values in group b varied from 51 4 to 36 0 and 7 3 to 5 6 respectively the averages of δ2h and δ18o for group a were 41 6 and 5 5 which were slightly higher than those of group b average of 43 5 and 6 6 respectively the δ2h and δ18o values for cold groundwater varied from 49 0 to 29 9 and 7 4 to 3 9 with a mean value of 42 5 and 6 1 which were similar to those of group b compared to that of river water samples which had an average value of 38 6 and 5 5 for δ2h and δ18o respectively the geothermal and cold groundwater were relatively enriched in light h and o isotopes moreover the δ2h and δ18o value in the rainwater sample was of 19 5 and 3 3 which was more enriched in heavy h and o isotopes the highest δ2h and δ18o values were appeared in the seawater sample 7 9 and 1 4 the recharge elevation calculated using equation 2 showed that group a ranged from 645 to 1105 m with an average value of 921 m for group b the recharge elevation varied from 435 to 1205 m and the mean value was 842 m which was close to that of cold groundwater range from 535 to 1510 m with a mean value of 844 m 4 3 13c and 14c isotopic composition the results of δ13c and 14c for group a group b and 2 cold groundwater samples were listed in table 1 and appendix a the δ13c vs pdb and 14c vs pmc values of group a varied from 14 87 to 7 47 and 3 53 to 26 17 with an average value of 10 96 and 13 18 compared to group a the average δ13c and 14c values for group b were relatively higher 8 50 for δ13c and 14 83 for 14c and the δ13c and 14c values of the two cold groundwater samples c1 and c8 differed greatly 17 82 and 32 68 c1 7 67 and 7 39 c8 the apparent groundwater ages were calculated based on the half life formula 1 of radioactive 14c it showed that the apparent ages of geothermal groundwater vary from 6530 to 28910 yr bp with a mean value of 17015 yr bp and the two cold groundwater samples were of 6690 and 18990 yr bp respectively 4 4 11b isotopic composition the δ11b values of 29 geothermal groundwater samples varied from 8 41 to 39 70 with an average value of 7 34 while the δ11b ratios of two cold groundwater samples were close 26 73 and 26 26 respectively table 1 and appendix a it was worth noting that b isotopic values of group a ranged from 0 30 to 39 70 much higher than those in group b from 8 41 to 3 65 4 5 the mixing ratios of seawater in thermal groundwater according to equation 4 the contributions of seawater to geothermal groundwater are calculated using cl and br concentrations fig 3 4 6 geothermometry kinds of geothermometers had been used to estimate geothermal reservoir temperatures liu et al 2019 mao et al 2015 mao et al 2021 wang et al 2015 on the basis of the chemical or isotopic composition of geothermal groundwater among these the cation such as na k ca na k ca mg na k k mg na li et al and silica chalcedony quartz amorphous silica et al geothermometers are widely applied nevertheless different geothermometers have their corresponding conditions concerned for example na k geothermometer is usually applied in geothermal water above 180 c while na k ca mg and silica based geothermometers are suitable for low temperature geothermal water in calcium rich groundwater the na k ca geothermometer is commonly used however the application of cation geothermometers is based on the equilibrium between solution and specific mineral reactions in a geothermal reservoir usually giggenbach s na k mg ternary diagram giggenbach et al 1988 is used to identify the equilibrium state of water rock reactions in geothermal reservoirs and then to determine whether the application of cation geothermometers is reliable fig 4 it was found that almost all geothermal groundwater samples were distributed in the immature waters area and partially equilibrated or mixed waters area meaning that the geothermal groundwater samples have not reached water rock equilibrium the cation geothermometers are thus not appropriate to estimate the geothermal reservoir temperature of this region under disequilibrium conditions silica geothermometers may be more suitable three silica geothermometers containing a chalcedony geothermometer and two quartz geothermometers with or without steam loss were applied to estimate the geothermal reservoir temperatures table 2 chalcedony temperatures were lower than those obtained from the quartz with or without steam loss geothermometers and closed to the outlet temperature of the thermal groundwater due to heat energy loss or mixing of geothermal and cold groundwater during upwards movement of geothermal groundwater the geothermal reservoir temperatures should be higher than that of outlet temperature wang et al 2015 in addition the na k geothermometers temperatures are commonly used to estimate the deep geothermal reservoir temperatures qi et al 2017 wang and zheng 2019 thus geothermal reservoir temperatures should be theoretically between the outlet temperature and na k geothermometer temperature and should be more approximate to the deep geothermal reservoir temperatures therefore the quartz geothermometers were more suitable than that of the chalcedony geothermometer in this study area moreover the outcropping temperatures of thermal groundwater were less than 100 c in this study region thus the quartz geothermometer with steam loss thus was not appropriate based on the above discussion a quartz geothermometer without a steam loss was most suitable for the evaluation of geothermal reservoir temperatures the results showed that the reservoir temperature for group a ranged from 127 to 163 c with an average value of 140 c that was higher than that of group b with a mean value of 118 c and varied from 81 to 140 c fig 5 a and 5b 5 discussion 5 1 the origin of geothermal groundwater the stable isotopes of 2h and 18o of geothermal and non geothermal groundwater are usually used as a powerful trace to identify the origin water rock interactions and distribution of groundwater chen et al 2016 qiu et al 2018 yuan et al 2018 relationships of δ2h and δ18o in geothermal and non geothermal water samples are plotted in fig 6 it showed that all groundwater geothermal and non geothermal groundwater and surface water samples river water rainwater and seawater were located around the global meteoric water line gmwl craig 1961 and the local meteoric water line lmwl yuan 2013 indicating that meteoric water was the main recharge source of groundwater furthermore surface water samples river water and rainwater were closely situated in the bottom right corner of the gmwl suggesting that evaporation had an effect on these samples qiu et al 2018 beyond that there was an apparent stratification between group a and group b for group a the δ18o shifts to the right of gmwl related to group b which could be ascribed to the oxygen isotope exchange reaction of geothermal water samples in group a with the surrounding rocks during the deep circulation or strongly water rock interactions at high temperatures remarkably though the distribution of samples in group a were scattered most of them were located between cold groundwater and seawater indicating that the mixing of cold groundwater or seawater with geothermal groundwater samples in group a besides the fractionation of h and o stable isotopes in high temperature geothermal systems can be significantly influenced by the strong water rock interaction guo et al 2010 the longer resistance time between thermal groundwater with surrounding rock resulted in the formation of secondary minerals enriched with lighter oxygen in their lattices as well as the elevation effect craig 1961 qiu et al 2018 the value of 2h for thermal groundwater and cold groundwater showed that the recharge elevation of group a 921 m was larger than that of group b 842 m and cold groundwater 844 m according to the recharge elevation of thermal groundwater and hydrogeological conditions of the study area the low mountains and hills were considered to be recharge areas in the northwestern study area which was more than 10 km away from local geothermal fields 5 2 circulation depths and ages of geothermal groundwater the circulation depth of groundwater is a significant hydrogeological parameter that indicates the source and formation mechanism of groundwater and it is also an important factor affecting the reservoir temperature in general the deeper circulation depth of geothermal groundwater leads to higher reservoir temperature the circulation depth of the groundwater in this study was estimated by the reservoir s temperatures that were calculated from the quartz geothermometer on the basis of this estimation it is notable that the averages of circulation depths of group a 3330 m were much deeper than that of group b 2749 m and cold groundwater 880 m the circulation time of geothermal groundwater is also an important parameter which affects the renewal ability of geothermal groundwater in geothermal systems the 14c technique is an extensive application and developed tool for estimating groundwater ages mao et al 2018a qiu et al 2018 comparing the results of geothermal and non thermal groundwater ages of the six models the values of age corrected by vogel and tamers models were similar and they were more reasonable than other models which given older or younger and even unreasonable results in table 3 here the average dating results of vogel and tamers models were taken as the groundwater ages it showed that the ages of geothermal groundwater range from 1441 to 12245 yr bp with a mean value of 7213 yr bp and the ages of this two cold groundwater were 3497and 9012 yr bp respectively fig 7 the ages of thousands of years from the cold groundwater samples could be attributed to the mixing of thermal groundwater for the groundwater sample c1 it was about 100 m away from the xinzhou geothermal field geothermal well which may be affected by the mixing of geothermal water resulting in an increase of the measured age of cold groundwater for the groundwater sample c8 it was located in the wuchuan sihuideepfault which had experienced a deep circulation along the fault and then outcropped on thesurface in the form of spring moreover the previously filed survey showed that there was a thermal spring near sample c8 yuan 2013 however the thermal spring had disappeared when we conducted our field study therefore it was reasonable to presume that the disappeared thermal spring has an influence on the cold spring c8 apart from that previous research of eastern guangdong province had reached similar conclusions mao et al 2018b table a4 significantly the ages of the geothermal groundwater increased from the inland area yangchun to the coastal area guanghai in addition the ages of group b from the 14c results showed a heterogeneous scenario suggesting that the geothermal groundwater in this area was independent and mostly runoff scale of groundwater was limited in other words the geothermal groundwater in this area had experienced a local deep circulation with a short horizontal path 5 3 the major geochemical processes for different geothermal groundwater in the study area br and cl are conservative elements that can be utilized to identify seawater intrusions chen et al 2016 he et al 2018 vengosh et al 2002 wang and jiao 2012 in the present study the concentrations of cl and br in group a were higher than that of group b and group a is mainly distributed in the coastal area while group b was primarily scattered in the inland area fig 8 moreover the contents of cl and br in group a showed an increasing trend from offshore to shore in the same direction this distribution would be attributed to the influence of the hydrogeochemical processes taken in the regional geothermal system generally speaking strong water rock interaction under high temperature longer residence times as well as mixing with seawater were the main salinization processes of geothermal groundwater rodríguez et al 2016 sunan sakti syah alam et al 2019 wang and jiao 2012 zhao et al 2017 for group a the abnormally high concentration of br and cl may be caused by the mixing of the geothermal groundwater with seawater because even geothermal groundwater influenced by magma like those in yangbajing high temperature geothermal systems do not have such high contents of br and cl guo et al 2007 yuan et al 2014a also the process of increasing the concentrations of br and cl by the dissolution of rocks seems slow and thus hco3 rather becomes the main anion in the geothermal waters besides the study area had experienced three times seawater intrusions and most samples of group a were distributed along the coastal zone yuan 2013 as such it was postulated that seawater had a significant impact on the concentrations of major ions in geothermal groundwater samples of group a beyond that the relationships between cl and various ions also supported this statement as shown in fig 9 all geothermal groundwater samples of group a were located between cold groundwater and seawater in addition there were also excellent positive correlations between cl and other ions na so4 and br indicating that seawater would be an important source of cl for group a differently group b presented a remarkably similar trend with cold groundwater implying seawater has no obvious contribution on them moreover it was found that group a with higher cl content greater than19 8 mmol l and up to 199 2 mmol l had lower γna γcl rations that varied from 0 45 mmol l to 1 00 mmol l and closed to that of seawater sample 0 72 mmol l in contrast group b from the inland area with relatively low cl concentration ranged from 0 11 to 12 48 mmol l with an average of 1 66 mmol l had higher γna γcl rations up to 20 85 mmol l fig 10 higher γna γcl rations and low tds in group b can be interpreted by the dissolution of surrounding na bearing minerals such as plagioclase feldspar which has been found in this study area during groundwater circulation and infiltration in the aquifers at high temperatures therefore water rock interaction showed a more substantial influence on the concentrations of ions in group b and cold groundwater compared with that from group a 5 4 extra evidence from b stable isotope for mixing process and b depletion b is a dissolved trace element which is widespread in geothermal groundwater it has two natural stable isotopes 10b and 11b due to the relatively large mass differences and its participation in most biogeochemical processes there is significant b isotopic fractionation during b transformations in a geothermal system which is a useful tool for tracing geochemical processes such as identifying the origins of boron in thermal groundwater the water rock interaction and the mixing of different water types bernard et al 2011 liu et al 2019 purnomo et al 2016 vengosh et al 1991b yuan et al 2014a zhang et al 2015 in addition b and cl are generally considered as conservative elements during groundwater circulation and the contents of b and cl in geothermal groundwater are commonly higher than that in non geothermal water reflecting relatively deep circulation paths and more extensive interaction with host rocks guo et al 2007 liu et al 2020 yuan et al 2014a yuan et al 2019 previous researches have demonstrated that the correlations of b γna γcl γb γcl versus δ11b can be used to identify geochemical processes such as seawater intrusion in geothermal systems aggarwal et al 2000 kakihana et al 1987 leeman et al 2005 nomura et al 1982 oi et al 1993 purnomo et al 2016 there was a significant difference in b and δ11b values between group a and group b in this study reflecting that these two types of geothermal groundwater could undergo two different geochemical processes including mixing with another water end member water rock interaction which was labeled as trend ⅰ and trend ⅱ respectively as presented in fig 11 a group a presented a wide variation of δ11b and a narrow range of 1 b values this can be explained by the mixing process between lower b concentration with lighter δ11b cold groundwater or geothermal water and higher b concentration with heavier δ11b seawater such a scenario was consistent with the results from the h and o isotopes a similar trend was also presented in fig 11b it showed that the γna γcl ratios of the cl type geothermal water including all samples of group a and some of group b were close to that of seawater 0 72 indicating that these samples could be affected by seawater intrusion moreover 1000γb γcl ratios of group a are similar to seawater 0 98 suggesting the mixing between geothermal water and seawater fig 11c significantly similar 1000γb γcl ratios were also found in the northern rift valley and java geothermal systems purnomo et al 2016 vengosh et al 1994 these regions have been confirmed to have a seawater influence which forwardly proves the mixing of solutes through seawater intrusion in samples from group a however both γna γcl and 1000γb γcl ratios of most geothermal groundwater samples in group a were lower than that from the seawater suggesting loss of na and b could be due to another hydrochemical process such as cation exchange and adsorption onto clay minerals aggarwal et al 2000 bernard et al 2011 he et al 2018 kakihana et al 1987 leslie et al 2014 purnomo et al 2016 vengosh et al 1991a vengosh et al 1991b previous studies suggested that during adsorption onto marine and or hydrothermal alteration of clay minerals b will be removed from the water and the water becomes enriched in δ11b he et al 2018 leslie et al 2014 vengosh et al 1994 all geothermal groundwater samples of group a were collected in the coastal area of guangdong where clay minerals especially hydrothermal alteration minerals such as kaolin and chlorite are widespread yuan 2013 as such the b concentration of geothermal groundwater samples from group a could be depleted by the adsorption of clay minerals therefore concentrations of b and δ11b values in the geothermal groundwater in group a were probably controlled by multiple processes including seawater intrusion and adsorption of clay minerals compared with group a samples from group b non saline geothermal water were characterized by lower δ11b values and wider 1 b values the δ11b values of the geothermal waters in group b were much lower than that of the seawater while the γna γcl and γb γcl ratios were significantly higher than that of seawater indicating little or no seawater fraction in geothermal water samples moreover the δ11b values of geothermal water in group b fall into the scope of those for granites 9 7 to 6 8 purnomo et al 2016 vengosh et al 1994 xiao et al 2013 and similar to those for kangding geothermal field yuan et al 2019 which suggested that the b resource in geothermal groundwater is related to the dissolution of granite in addition the 1000γb γcl ratios in the geothermal groundwater of the kangding geothermal field were closed to that of group b fig 11c therefore a conclusion can be made that lower δ11b and b concentrations in the geothermal groundwater of group b were probably controlled by interactions between geothermal waters and host rocks furthermore geothermal groundwater in kangding yangbajing and yangyi geothermal fields have shown similar δ11b values but different 1000b cl ratios to the geothermal groundwater in this study b in geothermal groundwater in yangbajing and yangyi geothermal fields was primarily derived from deep mantle processes but the 1000γb γcl ratios in geothermal groundwater of group b are much lower than them fig 11c consequently it suggested that seawater and deep mantle processes cannot provide abundant b for geothermal groundwater in group b the b and δ11b values in group b were thus mainly contributed by the interaction between the surrounding rocks and groundwater 5 5 quantification of seawater intrusion based on a mass balance model the contributions of seawater to geothermal groundwater were calculated using cl and br concentrations the results indicated that the mixing ratios of seawater calculated by cl were similar to that of br in both group a and group b fig 3 however the influence of seawater on these two types of geothermal groundwater differed greatly as shown in fig 3 the mixing ratios of seawater in group a calculated by cl and br vary from 4 90 to 49 60 and 7 21 to 53 81 respectively in contrast the mixing ratios of seawater in group b less than or equal to 3 60 are much lower than that of group a furthermore in group b the cl type geothermal water has a higher mixing ratio of seawater than that of hco3 type 6 conclusion hydrogeochemistry and isotopes h o c and b have been introduced to unravel the hydrogeochemical evolution of saline geothermal water from the coastal area of guangdong province south china the hydrogeochemical types of water samples in this region were complicated and geothermal groundwater samples were mainly cl type and hco3 type moreover most of the cl type geothermal groundwater belonged to saline geothermal groundwater and these samples were located around coastal regions according to the hydrogeochemical types and tds values the geothermal groundwater was classified into two groups group a was mainly cl type whereas group b was mainly hco3 type the stable isotopes of 2h and 18o revealed that meteoric water was the main recharge source of all geothermal groundwater samples from group a and group b the geothermal reservoir s temperatures were evaluated by using a quartz geothermometer without steam loss the reservoir temperature for group a ranged from 127 to 163 c which was higher than that of group b varies from 81 to 140 c the corresponding circulation depth of group a varied from 3007 to 4031 m which is deeper than that of group b ranging from 711 to 3965 m based on the 14c technique the circulation time of geothermal groundwater ranged from 1441 to 12245 yr bp with a mean value of 7213 yr bp furthermore circulation ages of group b were heterogeneous indicating that the geothermal groundwater in this area was independent and mostly runoff scale of groundwater was limited besides the relationships of cl vs ions and b and its isotopic results show that water rock interactions played an important role in the hydrochemistry of group a and group b moreover group a also presented a signature of seawater intrusion and the mixing ratios of seawater calculated by cl and br ranged from 4 90 to 49 60 and 7 21 to 53 81 respectively credit authorship contribution statement jianfei yuan conceptualization methodology investigation data curation writing original draft fen xu supervision software writing review

3729,understanding the fluid flow and solute transport mechanisms in fractured rocks is essential for many geoengineering applications in this study the fluid flow and solute transport in a fracture matrix system with a three dimensional 3 d discrete fracture network dfn are modelled through an efficient numerical simulation workflow the simulation approach is used to systematically investigate the effects of the rock matrix on the transport behaviors in a fracture matrix system the results show that the mass exchange between the dfn and the rock matrix can be accurately evaluated based on the conforming mesh at the interface between the fractures using triangular elements and the rock matrix using tetrahedral elements the complementary cumulative distribution function curves ccdfs for the physical processes that consider sorption and decay exhibit significant long tail characteristics which suggests that the sorption and decay processes play an important role in retarding the migration of solutes in fractured rocks it is also found that a larger matrix porosity enhances the mass exchange at the interface between the dfn and the rock matrix which consequently promotes the matrix diffusion effects the distribution of the concentration plumes in the matrix demonstrates in fracture matrix systems with larger fracture densities could result in a better connection between the fracture networks and the larger interface specific wetting areas which therefore promotes the mass exchange these findings are critical to understanding the migration behavior of radioactive nuclides in far field areas and for the deep geological disposal of nuclear waste keywords solute transport fracture matrix system discrete fracture network mass exchange retardation 1 introduction the flow and transport of solutes contaminants through fractured rocks have become crucial issues mainly due to the rapid development of underground spaces and resources such as high level nuclear waste disposal joyce et al 2014 tsang et al 2015 yang et al 2019 co2 sequestration jenkins et al 2015 and geothermal and hydrocarbon extraction middleton et al 2015 wang et al 2019 compared with the rock matrix fractures have much larger permeabilities and are usually regarded as the predominant pathways for the migration of fluids and solutes therefore an accurate understanding of the coupled flow and transport mechanisms in complex fractured rocks is essential for design construction operation and safety assessment in rock engineering based on the literature representations of complicated and discontinuous fractured rocks are mainly divided into continuous and discrete methods berkowitz 2002 larsson et al 2013 maryška et al 2005 in contrast to the continuous method the discrete fracture network dfn approach has been widely used due to its advantage of explicitly considering the geometry and properties of individual fractures de dreuzy et al 2002 lei et al 2017 long and billaux 1987 long et al 1985 maillot et al 2016 xu and dowd 2010 this representation allows for the prediction of flow and solute transport within discrete fractured rocks in detail cvetkovic and frampton 2012 hyman et al 2015 painter and cvetkovic 2005 painter et al 2002 comparing with two dimensional 2 d dfn the three dimensional 3 d dfn has the outstanding advances of describing the orientation connectivity and permeability of the real rock masses for example huang et al 2016 and lang et al 2014 compared the equivalent permeability of 3 d dfn with the permeability computed on arbitrarily extracted 2 d cut planes their results show that the latter underestimates the magnitude of permeability by up to 3 orders of magnitude this is because there exist some isolated fracture clusters in the 2 d cut planes and there may be even not a single continuous path formed between the inlet and outlet boundary especially for the low fracture density cases therefore the fracture connectivity in 3 d dfn model cannot be accurately captured by their 2 d cut planes or 2 d dfn model and it is essential to conduct fluid flow and solute transport simulation in 3 d fracture networks based on the 3 d dfn method extensive investigations have been conducted to evaluate transport behaviors in complex fractured rocks including laboratory tests pastore et al 2015 suzuki et al 2019 and numerical simulations berrone et al 2018 cvetkovic and frampton 2012 frampton and cvetkovic 2011 frampton et al 2019 hyman et al 2015 hyman et al 2016 kang et al 2020 makedonska et al 2016 sherman et al 2020 wu et al 2021 as for the experimental aspect pastore et al 2015 created an artificially fractured rock and carried out experiments to observe the flow and heat transport behavior their results indicate that heat migration can be significantly delayed by the presence of a non darcian flow regime using 3 d printing technology suzuki et al 2019 made a complex dfn physical model and then conducted tracer transport experiments they found that the breakthrough curve btc was in a good agreement with the numerical simulation results suggesting that the 3 d printed fracture network model can be used for flow and transport simulations although the evolution of the solute concentration can be measured at the outlet direct observations of the transport mechanism inside the fracture network using experimental methods are usually impossible because the printing material is not transparent and ensuring well controlled monitoring conditions is difficult in this case numerical techniques have been further developed to evaluate and capture the flow and transport behavior inside 3 d fractured rocks hyman et al 2015 developed a computational suite dfnworks to generate a stochastic 3 d dfn then they applied pflotran to obtain the flow solutions and used a lagrangian based approach to simulate the transport in 3 d fractured rocks they further investigated the impacts of several key parameters such as the correlations between the fracture size transmissivity hyman et al 2016 and fracture density sherman et al 2020 on the transport properties in a 3 d dfn they found that an earlier breakthrough time can be obtained when the fracture size and transmissivity correlations or the increasing fracture density are considered makedonska et al 2016 and frampton et al 2019 investigated the influence of the variability of the internal aperture on anomalous transport in a 3 d dfn they found that the variability of the internal aperture in a 3 d dfn causes preferential flow channeling generally decreased early arrival times and delayed bulk mass arrival kang et al 2020 carried out 3 d dfn simulations of fluid flow and solute transport to explore the combined effects of the tracer injection mode and fracture aperture heterogeneity their results demonstrated that the interplay between the injection mode and the aperture heterogeneity can result in strong early arrival and long tails in the btcs ngo et al 2017 proposed an efficient workflow for transport simulations in large scale 3 d dfns which uses frac for the conforming meshing and the open source program dumux for simulating the solute transport berrone et al 2018 presented a partial differential equation pde constrained optimization formulation to perform steady state fluid flow and unsteady transport simulations in complex 3 d dfns the simulation results of ngo et al 2017 and berrone et al 2018 suggest that the eulerian approach is an appropriate approach and it can directly capture the overall development of the solute plumes within the fracture network the aforementioned studies were restricted to simulations of 3 d dfns however natural fractured rocks are basically composed of a fracture network and porous rock and it is well known that the interactions between fractures and the surrounding rock matrix have profound influences on the transport behavior especially on long time scales grisak and pickens 1980 neretnieks 1980 sudicky and frind 1982 tang et al 1981 therefore it is important to consider the effect of the mass exchange between the fractures and rock matrix to obtain a more accurate prediction of the solute transport behavior in fractured rocks in engineering applications in recent years research on solute transport in fracture matrix systems has been carried out using numerical simulations zou et al 2017a 2017b investigated the properties of the flow and transport in a 3 d rough walled fracture matrix system with matrix surrounding a single fracture or two intersecting fractures their results demonstrated the significant effects of matrix diffusion under low velocity conditions especially in the zones around the contact spots abdelghani et al 2015 studied the effect of the fracture network characteristics on unsaturated water flow and mining waste contaminant transport in a two dimensional 2d fractured rock with an orthogonal fracture network the evolution of the concentration distribution was found to exhibit strong interactions between the fracture network and the rock matrix on long time scales as for more complex fractured rocks embedded with 3 d dfns li et al 2020 examined the effect of the diffusion coefficient of the rock matrix on the variability of the saturated flow and the solute transport in 3 d fractured rocks using a coupling model they demonstrated that the diffusion coefficient of the rock matrix alters the overall transport behaviors of the solutes suggesting that the diffusion coefficient of the rock matrix should not be ignored when trying to obtain a precise prediction ma et al 2019 simulated and analyzed solute transport in complicated 3 d fractured rocks using the unified pipe network method upm in their study the fracture matrix system was meshed using the constrained delaunay discretization method wang et al 2017 their results showed that the mass exchange between the dfn and the rock matrix can be efficiently evaluated using the conforming vertices on the fracture matrix interface between the triangular and tetrahedral elements recently hyman and dentz 2021 investigated the combined effect of flow heterogeneity and matrix diffusion on solute transport using an upscaled ctrw model in their model the diffusive mass transfer between fracture and matrix was quantified by a compound poisson process the results from previous studies generally show that the breakthrough tailing was amplified in the presence of matrix diffusion however the transport behaviors in fracture matrix systems were rarely simulated explicitly with considering 3 d fracture networks and the effects of physical processes matrix properties and fracture densities of fracture network on transport have not been systematically analyzed through explicitly numerical simulation the goals of this study are to systematically evaluate the effect of the rock matrix on the fluid flow and solute transport in a complex 3 d fracture matrix system with a stochastic 3 d dfn and to provide insights into the coupled mass exchange between the dfn and the rock matrix to address the coupled flow and solute transport in a 3 d discrete fracture matrix system an efficient numerical simulation workflow is developed then the numerical simulation approach is validated against classical analytical solutions for solute transport in fracture matrix systems with a single fracture and with two parallel fractures after this validation the effects of the rock matrix on the transport behaviors in the fractured rocks based on different physical processes e g advection diffusion sorption and decay different matrix porosities and different fracture densities of dfns are systematically investigated 2 methodology all of the simulations in this study were conducted using the computational suite dfnworks hyman et al 2015 dfnsmeshgenerator3 d wang et al 2017 tetgen si 2015 and opengeosys software kolditz et al 2012a kolditz et al 2012b an efficient workflow was developed to combine the aforementioned software fig 1 the main workflow has three principal parts 1 generation of a 3 d dfn 2 mesh generation of a 3 d discrete fracture matrix system and 3 flow and transport calculations the coupling between the three parts is fully automated and does not require the user actions needed when using various python scripts the coupled workflow is briefly introduced below 2 1 generation of the 3 d dfn the stochastic 3 d dfn modeling approach is one common simulation tool used to represent geometrically complex fracture systems due to the uncertainties of the geometrical data obtained from the field measurements using borehole logging or outcrop mapping in the stochastic dfn methodology the fractures are assumed to be circular disks elliptic plates or polygons and the fracture characteristics such as the fracture location orientation size and aperture are assumed to follow their own distributions which can be obtained via a large number of field measurements then based on the principle of monte carlo simulation and the fracture properties a stochastic 3 d dfn can be reproduced frampton and cvetkovic 2011 hyman et al 2014 lei et al 2017 maillot et al 2016 xu and dowd 2010 frampton and cvetkovic 2011 hyman et al 2014 lei et al 2017 maillot et al 2016 xu and dowd 2010 the 3 d dfn model in this study was generated using the dfngen module of dfnworks hyman et al 2015 a feature rejection algorithm for meshing fram hyman et al 2014 was used when generating the 3 d dfn it should be noted that a prescribing minimum feature size h was used in the fram algorithm to restrict the generation of the dfn by only creating features of this size or larger and therefore this setting resolves the obstacles of meshing a dfn containing arbitrarily small features further information about this module can be found in hyman et al 2014 2015 in addition all of the isolated fractures in the dfn models were eliminated during the generation process and only the backbone of the dfn was used to conduct the flow and transport analysis the effect of the isolated fractures will be considered in future research because the diffusion process in a rock matrix is an important factor in our research in this study the fractures were represented by circular disks within a cubic domain with a side length of 15 m the fracture radii r m were sampled from a truncated power law distribution with exponent α and upper and lower cut offs ru r0 we selected α 1 8 a lower cut off of 2 m and an upper cut off of 10 m the power law relationship between the fracture aperture and the fracture size is a common assumption in dfn models bogdanov et al 2007 de dreuzy et al 2002 frampton and cvetkovic 2010 hyman et al 2016 joyce et al 2014 sherman et al 2020 wellman et al 2009 in this study the relationship was set to b 5 0 10 4 r sherman et al 2020 and the fracture permeability is defined by k b 2 12 based on the cubic law therefore the hydraulic aperture varies among the fractures with the larger fractures having wider hydraulic apertures than the smaller fractures for this model setup however the variations in each fracture caused by the aperture roughness are not considered here for simplicity the fracture orientation is defined by the fisher distribution in order to create a disordered network we set the concentration parameter to κ 0 1 which is the same value used by sherman et al 2020 the network s density was represented by a classical parameter p30 which is defined as the ratio between the total number of fractures and the domain volume three increasing fracture densities with p30 0 00089 0 0036 and 0 011 1 m3 were considered fig 2 shows the generated 3 d dfn models with different fracture densities which are denoted as d1 d2 and d3 respectively the aperture values for the different fractures are also shown in fig 2 as can be seen from fig 2 the dfn model becomes more complex and better connected as the density increases moreover for all dfn models at least one set of fractures connects the two opposite model boundaries 2 2 mesh generation of a 3 d discrete fracture matrix system as shown in fig 1 there are three main steps to obtaining the final mesh for the 3 d discrete fracture matrix system the triangular meshing of the 3 d dfn and the six boundary surfaces of the rock matrix is the critical step before the tetrahedral meshing of the rock matrix once the 3 d dfn model is generated the fracture parameters such as the fracture radii the fracture normal vector and the translation of the dfn are automatically converted to the input file for triangular meshing then the meshing is performed using the open source toolbox dfnsmeshgenerator3 d wang et al 2017 to create conforming delaunay triangulation of the 3 d dfn and the matrix surfaces the conforming delaunay triangulation algorithm was applied to preserve the intersection between any two intersecting fractures using this algorithm an adaptive triangular mesh can be generated and the mesh can be optionally coarsened away from the fracture interactions by a predefined coarser factor the ratio of the maximum to minimum mesh sizes in order to preserve the computational resources in order to preserve the meshes of the 3 d dfn when meshing the rock matrix the six boundary surfaces of the matrix should be considered when performing the triangulation mesh with this consideration the sensitive position such as the interaction line of the fracture and boundary matrix can also be refined since it plays an important role in the flow and transport processes the detailed triangular meshes of the dfn and matrix surfaces are shown in fig 3 it shows that the meshes in the interaction areas are denser the refinement optimizes the physical processes that occur in the fracture interaction areas such as decreases in the pressure gradient and the velocity after the generation of the triangular meshes tetrahedralization of the rock matrix is performed the major difficulty in meshing the 3 d fractured rock matrix is to recover and validate the topological information and the triangular meshes of the 3 d dfn in this study the efficient open source software tetgen si 2015 was used to carry out the tetrahedralization the detailed methodology of tetgen is described in the user s manual in tetgen a set of non intersecting 3 d piecewise linear complexes plcs are described in the input files which includes the node list facet list hole list and region list due to the strict requirements for the geometric relationships verbree 2006 of the plcs we used the triangular elements of the fractures and the matrix surfaces fig 3a to construct the input plcs thus the input geometry can be divided into two parts the node list and the facet list of the triangular elements in this study version 1 6 of tetgen was used in addition the y switch was used to preserve the input boundary faces of the plcs when performing the tetrahedral meshing therefore the tetrahedral elements were automatically adapted and conformed to the triangular mesh of the fracture and matrix surfaces fig 3b finally the mesh model of the 3 d discrete fracture matrix system can be obtained using the data transformation of the final triangular and tetrahedral meshes furthermore the mesh model can be converted for visualization or for use as finite element meshes for flow and transport simulations in this study a series of python scripts were developed to generate vtk format files for visualization in paraview henderson and ahrens 2006 and msh format files were generated for flow transport simulation in opengeosys ogs kolditz et al 2012a kolditz et al 2012b 2 3 flow and transport simulations the fluid flow process in fractures is modeled by solving the reynolds equation which has been widely used to simulate the laminar fluid flow through fractures brown 1987 1 x b 3 12 μ p x y b 3 12 μ p y 0 where μ is the dynamic viscosity pa s b is the fracture aperture m and p is the pressure pa as shown in fig 4 the two boundary conditions on the fracture matrix system for flow simulation were considered the first boundary is the fixed pressure on the inlet face sin and the outlet face sout and the other boundary is the neumann zero flux condition on the other four impermeable faces sim 2a p s in p 1 2b p s out p 2 2c n p s im 0 where n is the direction normal to the boundary surface in this study to systematically investigate the properties of the solute transport in a fracture matrix system the physical mechanisms such as advection and dispersion in the fracture diffusion and decay in the fracture matrix system sorption on the fracture surface and matrix were involved for steady state flow through a 3 d fracture matrix system with constant material parameters the above mentioned processes are governed by the following differential equation kolditz et al 2012a kolditz et al 2012b ma et al 2019 which couples the mass exchange between the fracture and matrix automatically 3 θ π c π t 1 r π θ π d π c π u π c π λ θ π c π where the superscript π denotes the type of medium i e π f for fracture and π m for rock matrix θ c t and u are the porosity solute concentration kg m3 time s and flow velocity m s respectively λ is the decay constant 1 year which is equal to l n 2 t 0 5 and t 0 5 is the half life of the solute such as radioactive matter year this equation was used to calculate the concentration distribution while considering decay and sorption with a linear henry isotherm the retardation coefficient r represents the effect of sorption on the fracture surface and the rock matrix and for the henry isotherm r is defined as follows 4a r f 1 2 k f b 4b r m 1 ρ b k m θ m where k f is the distribution coefficient of the fracture m k m is the distribution coefficient

direction of the fluid flow m u is the absolute value of the flow velocity m s τ is the tortuosity of the flow channel and d is the molecular diffusion coefficient m2 s the initial concentration was assumed to be zero throughout the entire fracture matrix system ω the inlet surface was a dirichlet boundary assuming continuous injection with c 0 1 0 kg m3 the outlet surface was an open boundary

publications of ogs kolditz et al 2012a kolditz et al 2012b kolditz et al 2018 the detailed validation tests of the proposed workflow of the simulation method are presented in appendix a 3 results and discussion the proposed numerical workflow was applied to systematically investigate the coupled properties of the fluid flow and solute transport in a 3 d discrete fracture matrix system considering the effects of the different physical processes different matrix porosities and different fracture densities the modeling schemes and discussion of the result are presented below 3 1 modeling schemes and parameter settings the 3 d dfn model used to study the effects of the different physical processes and the different matrix properties is the model d2 with a fracture density of p30 0 0036 1 m3 the detailed modeling scheme are presented in table 1 as shown in table 1 whether sorption or decay are considered is the main setting for the study of different physical process and the cases are denoted as p1 p2 and p3 respectively in the second simulation scenario the matrix porosity was set to 0 01 0 05 and 0 1 which are denoted as m1 m2 and m3 for comparison a simulation without considering the rock matrix was also conducted which is denoted as m0 in addition the d1 d2 and d3 generated in section 2 1 were used for the simulations with different fracture densities the flux weighted concentration c f obtained from the numerical results can be expressed as a ratio of the total solute mass to the surface area of downstream 7a c f c d y d z d y d z to enable convenient comparison of the results the concentration and time was normalized as follows 7b c c f c 0 7c t u t l where t is the dimensionless time or the pore volume pv u is the mean flow velocity of the fractures m s and l is the length of the rock matrix m note that the pv here represents the unit time for the fluid fills the overall fracture void space the physical parameters and settings of the boundary conditions used for the simulations are presented in table 2 and are shown in fig 3b in addition the permeability in the rock matrix was assumed to be 1 0 10 15 m2 according to the site test ma et al 2019 3 2 the effects of matrix diffusion sorption and decay fig 4 illustrates the flow field inside the dfn and the pressure field inside the dfn and the rock matrix for p3 which are the same as in p1 and p2 due to the extremely low permeability in the rock matrix the calculated velocity in the matrix is almost zero for simplicity the velocity results in the rock matrix are not demonstrated in this study as can be seen from fig 4a due to the discontinuities and irregularities of the fracture networks and the varied apertures of the different fractures the iso surface of the pressure inside the dfn exhibits an uneven distribution resulting in a highly heterogeneous and anisotropic pressure distribution in the rock matrix fig 4b 4c fig 4d displays the corresponding flow field in the dfn note that the velocity shown in fig 4d is the resultant velocity and the value is the module of the velocity vector in fig 4d the contours represent the flow velocity warmer colors indicate higher values and blue colors represent lower values regions with significantly high flow i e the fractures close to the inlet and the low flow i e the fractures with dead ends or fracture edges with non slip boundary conditions can be seen in fig 4d the velocity vectors i e the black arrows show that the flow is coming in through some interactions and going out through other interactions resulting in tortuous flow paths in addition the black arrows form a preferential flow path in the dfn domain which is the main control channel for fluid flow from the inflow boundary to the outflow boundary fig 5 shows the evolution of the concentration in the dfn and the matrix for p3 at t 400 4 000 and 40 000 pv as shown in fig 5a 5c as time progresses the continuously released concentration on the left boundary gradually migrates along the connected fractures with an obvious concentration front and it also penetrates into the rock matrix fig 5e 5f faster transport occurs in the main connected channel than in the other channels this is because the transport process in the main channel is dominated by high velocity advection while the other channels are dominated by low velocity diffusion this is attributed to the matrix diffusion process in which the solutes gradually migrate from the fracture networks into the rock matrix the concentration fields at t 40 000 pv in the dfn and the entire fracture matrix system for the different physical processes are shown in fig 6 the results show that the concentration decreases in both the dfn and the fracture matrix system when sorption and decay are considered this is because the sorption and decay processes can significantly retard the solute transport thus resulting in the solute transport through the fractured rocks taking a longer time as shown in fig 6 the concentration distributions and iso value lines in profile y 5 m at t 40 000 pv show that the solute dissolution plumes of the three models are reduced in a step wise manner for example the plumes in p1 almost migrate everywhere on the profile while there are still some areas that the solutes have not reached for p3 demonstrating the strong retardation effect of the sorption and decay processes the cumulative distribution function cdf curves for the concentration accumulation features c at the outlet downstream boundary of the fracture matrix system for the different physical processes were plotted fig 7 a in order to compare the results and show the long tail of the concentration distribution complementary cumulative distribution function ccdf curves which are equal to one minus the cdf were also plotted fig 7b in this study to further analyze the interplay behaviors between the fractures and matrix log plots of the cdfs and ccdfs at the outlet downstream boundary in the fractures and that in the entire fracture matrix system were plotted respectively fig 7a and 7b as can be seen from fig 7a the cdf of the fractures for p3 the red dashed line increases at an exponential rate after the concentration outbreak when c 10 4 at approximately 250 pv and then it transitions to steady state at about 150 000 pv the red dashed line and 650 000 pv the red solid line for the fractures and the entire fracture matrix system respectively this result demonstrates that it takes a longer time for the fracture matrix system to reach steady state due to the matrix diffusion furthermore the ccdf for p3 in fig 7b show obvious heavier tails for the solute transport in the fracture matrix system compared to the fractures as shown in fig 7a and 7b the cdfs and ccdfs of p2 for the dfn and the fracture matrix system both exhibit delayed arrival times and heavier tailing characteristics than p1 which only considered the advection and diffusion processes these phenomena are mainly due to the retardation effect of the matrix sorption furthermore when the decay process is considered in p3 the resulting ccdfs exhibit heavier tailing which results in a higher ccdf value at steady state fig 7b interestingly the time required to reach the equilibrium state for p3 is much shorter than those of the others this can be explained by the decrease in the concentration of the solute in the fracture matrix system caused by the decay reaction these findings confirm that the physical processes such as sorption and decay significantly contribute to solute retardation in fractured rocks that is relevant to far field migration of radioactive nuclides after deep geological disposal 3 3 effect of matrix porosity in addition to the effects of diffusion sorption and decay various matrix porosities can also influence the transport properties in a 3 d discrete fracture matrix system fig 8 shows the contours and iso value lines of the concentration in the dfn and the rock matrix at steady state as can be seen the concentration plumes in the dfn shrank with increasing porosity in contrast the concentration plumes in the rock matrix expanded significantly when the porosity was increased from 0 01 to 0 1 to evaluate the behavior in the entire fracture matrix system for different porosity values a simulation without considering the rock matrix was also conducted and the cdfs and ccdfs of all of the simulation cases were calculated fig 9 a and 9b as shown in fig 9a when the effect of the rock matrix is ignored solute transport only in the fractures the arrival time for m0 about 0 1pv is almost 1 000 4 000 times earlier than when considering the effect of the rock matrix about 100 400pv it was also determined from the cdfs of the fracture for different matrix porosities that as the porosity decreases the arrival time becomes earlier in contrast the resulting ccdfs of the fractures for different matrix porosities exhibit heavier tailing and the corresponding ccdf values at steady state increase as the porosity increases however compared to those of the fractures the ccdfs of the matrix exhibit a more obvious long tailing as the porosity decreases fig 9b the reasons for the above findings are that the larger porosity of the rock matrix increases the mass exchange at the interface between the dfn and the rock matrix which decreases the concentration in the fractures and thus delays the solute transport in the fractures resulting in heavier tailing moreover the larger porosity of the matrix decreases the retardation effect of the sorption and accelerates the solute transport process in the matrix resulting in earlier arrival times and weaker long tailings for the fracture matrix system these phenomena demonstrate that the matrix porosity plays an important role in solute transport in fracture matrix systems 3 4 effect of fracture density three dfn models with different fracture densities were designed to investigate how the fracture density affects the flow and transport in a 3 d discrete fracture matrix system the comparisons of the results of the pressure and velocity fields are shown in fig 10 as the fracture density increases the pressure distribution in the dfn becomes more heterogeneous and the pressure gradient increases in particular the pressure field in some of the fractures can be suddenly cut off due to discontinuities or dead ends this enhanced heterogeneity was also observed in the matrix as the density increased the corresponding velocity fields in fig 10c 10f and 10i show that as the density increases the connected fractures intersect with more fractures thus resulting in more flow channels and more tortuous flow paths between the inflow and outflow boundaries fig 11 shows the contour maps and iso value lines of concentration in the dfn and rock matrix at steady state for a larger fracture density d3 there are more transport channels and a more heterogeneous concentration distribution occurs which is consistent with the results of the velocity field in the dfn fig 10i it can also be seen that the concentration plumes in the matrix are enhanced as the fracture density increases and results in a more homogeneous concentration distribution in the fracture matrix system for example the plumes in d3 almost migrate everywhere on the profile while there are still some areas that the solutes have not reached in d1 these findings indicate that the fracture density plays an important role in solute transport in fractured rocks that is a faster outbreak of radioactive nuclides may occur in the far field for a fracture network with a higher fracture density the results of the comparison of the cdfs and ccdfs for different fracture densities are shown in fig 12 which illustrates the transport characteristics of the solute transport in the 3 d discrete fracture matrix system as shown in fig 12a for a larger fracture density d3 the arrival time is shorter for both the fractures and the entire fracture matrix system this is due to the fact that a dfn with a larger density is prone to reduce the tortuosity of the preferential transport pathways between the inlet and outlet boundaries resulting in faster migration and earlier arrival of the solutes interestingly as time progresses the cdfs of the model with a larger fracture density d3 are lower than those of the model with a smaller fracture density d1 in addition as shown in fig 12b the resulting ccdfs of the dfn exhibit significantly longer tails and the corresponding ccdf value at steady state is lower for larger fracture densities d3 in contrast the ccdfs of the fracture matrix system exhibit heavier tailing as the density decreases the main reasons for these findings are that the better connected dfn for the case with the larger fracture density increases the interface areas between the fractures and matrix and thus promotes mass exchange between the dfn and the rock matrix resulting in more solutes penetrating into the rock matrix and thus decreasing the solute concentration in the dfn 4 conclusions in this study we systematically investigated the effects of the rock matrix on the transport behavior in a 3 d discrete fracture matrix system with a complex fracture network using an efficient numerical simulation workflow with emphasis on the impacts of physical processes i e advection diffusion sorption and decay the rock matrix porosity and the fracture density the main conclusions drawn from the results of this study are summarized as follows 1 an efficient and fully automated numerical workflow was proposed which includes coupling the generation of the 3 d dfn mesh generation of the 3 d discrete fracture matrix system and flow and transport calculations using a series of python scripts 2 the combined effects of the rock matrix and physical processes were assessed the ccdf curves exhibit heavier tails compared to the results of traditional advection diffusion processes suggesting that the sorption and decay processes play an important role in retarding the migration of solutes in fractured rocks it was also found that a larger matrix porosity increases the mass exchange at the interface between the dfn and the rock matrix and thus increases the contribution of the matrix diffusion 3 case studies of different fracture densities were carried out when the number of fractures in the dfn increased the pressure and flow field in the dfn became more heterogeneous however the concentration plumes in the matrix grew and transitioned to a more homogeneous distribution in addition the simulation results show that more concentration plumes penetrate into the rock matrix demonstrating that a better connected dfn with a larger fracture density increases the interface areas between the dfn and the rock matrix and thus promotes mass exchange these properties are critical for investigating the migration of radioactive nuclides into the far field after deep geological disposal this study demonstrated the importance of rock matrix on transport behaviors in 3 d discrete fracture matrix systems the numerical workflow proposed in this paper can be adopted to systematically analyze contaminant propagation in deterministic fracture networks or large scale stochastic fracture networks based on site investigations for various rock engineering projects such as the assessment of the safety of high level waste underground repositories in future studies we will systematically investigate the influences of the heterogeneity of the internal aperture of the dfn on the flow and solute transport through a 3 d discrete fracture matrix system credit authorship

parallel fracture matrix models and analytical solutions sudicky and frind 1982 tang et al 1981 were used as benchmarks to validate the reliability and feasibility of the proposed numerical workflow a 1 single fracture matrix model for the single fracture matrix model the geometric size was assumed to be 7 0 m 7 0 m 3 0 m and the meshes were generated by the proposed workflow in section 2 2 as shown in fig a1 a the parameters for numerical simulation were identical to the settings in tang et al 1981 which were listed in table a1 the fracture was assumed saturated and a constant head difference was applied between the inlet and outlet of the fracture so as to remain a flow velocity of 0 01 m day the initial and boundary conditions of concentration were described as follows a 1a c ω t 0 0 a 1b c x 0 z 0 t 0 c 0 fig a1 b shows the concentration distribution at steady state in the fracture matrix system the comparison between the simulation results and the anlytical results deriving from tang et al 1981 were plotted in fig a2 fig a2 a shows the concentration profiles along the fracture at 100 days 1000 days and 10000 days the 1 penetration depth d0 01 is 6 66 m based on the analytical solution which was calculated in tang et al 1981 therefore the steady state concentration profiles along the rock matrix at x 1 2 1 4 and 1 10 of d0 01 can be calculated as shown in fig a2 b fig a2 c shows the breakthrough curves for the fracture at the same points generally it can be found that the simulated results based on the proposed numerical workflow in this study agree well with the anlytical results a 2 parallel fracture matrix model for the parallel fracture matrix model the geometric size was set as 80 m 10 m 5 m the fracture spacing was set as 0 5 m and the meshes were generated by the proposed workflow as shown in fig 6 a the parameters for numerical simulation were identical to those listed in table 1 except the flow velocity increased to 0 1 m day the fracture was also assumed saturated and the constant head difference between the inlet and outlet of the fracture was adapt to the updated velocity the initial and boundary conditions of concentration were summarized as follows a 2a c ω t 0 0 a 2b c x 0 z 0 25 m t 0 c 0 fig a3 b shows the concentration distribution at steady state in the fracture matrix system the comparison results were plotted in fig a4 fig a4 a shows the concentration profiles along the fracture at 100 days 1000 days and 10000 days results indicated perfect agreement between the numerical results and analytical rsults at these three times the 1 penetration depth d0 01 for this case is 71 9 m based on the analytical solution from sudicky and frind 1982 fig a4 b c shows the steady state concentration profiles for the rock matrix and the breakthrough curves for the fracture at x 1 2 1 4 and 1 10 of d0 01 respectively it can also be found that the simulation results achieve a well agreement with the analytical results a 3 sensitivity analysis the resolution of meshes and time steps of solutions are two essential factors to reach mesh independency condition and numerical stability of the simulation results under this consideration the mesh size and time step sensitivity analysis procedure for the single fracture matrix model were carried out all the simulation parameters adopted for this verification were identical to table a1 and the results of concentration profiles along rock matrix at 1 2 1 4 and 1 10 of d0 01 at 20000 days were calculated fig a5 a and a5 c shows the results of the mesh size and time step sensitivity analysis to further quantify the differences between the numerical and analytical results for the sensitivity analysis the root mean square error rmse was introduced a 3a rmse i 1 n c num i c ana i 2 n where c num i and c ana i represents the concentration at the ith monitoring points to be compared with the numerical results and the analytical results respectively and n is the number of monitoring points in the concentration profiles the results were replotted in fig a5 b and d as shown in fig a5 b all the rmse values are small than 4 and generally decrease with increasing element numbers except the case with less element numbers 23328 meanwhile fig a5 d indicates that all the rmse values are small than 0 2 when the time steps decrease to 1000 or 500 days the porosity is another important factor that should be analyzed for single fracture matrix model concentrations of the analytical solutions and numerical simulations along the fracture and rock matrix with different porosity values when t 10000 days were presented in fig a6 as shown in fig a6 the results of numerical simulations also agree well with the analytical solution in general the above simulation results agree well with the analytical solutions which severs as a kind of mathematical verification of the numerical model and the proposed numerical workflow furthermore based on the well coupled triangular meshes and tetrahedral meshes between the interface of fractures and rock matrix it is reasonable to deduce that the workflow can accurately quantifying the mass exchange between the fracture and rock matrix and thus it can be concluded that the proposed workflow is feasible and reliable to investigate the coupled flow and solute transport in 3 d discrete fracture matrix

3729,understanding the fluid flow and solute transport mechanisms in fractured rocks is essential for many geoengineering applications in this study the fluid flow and solute transport in a fracture matrix system with a three dimensional 3 d discrete fracture network dfn are modelled through an efficient numerical simulation workflow the simulation approach is used to systematically investigate the effects of the rock matrix on the transport behaviors in a fracture matrix system the results show that the mass exchange between the dfn and the rock matrix can be accurately evaluated based on the conforming mesh at the interface between the fractures using triangular elements and the rock matrix using tetrahedral elements the complementary cumulative distribution function curves ccdfs for the physical processes that consider sorption and decay exhibit significant long tail characteristics which suggests that the sorption and decay processes play an important role in retarding the migration of solutes in fractured rocks it is also found that a larger matrix porosity enhances the mass exchange at the interface between the dfn and the rock matrix which consequently promotes the matrix diffusion effects the distribution of the concentration plumes in the matrix demonstrates in fracture matrix systems with larger fracture densities could result in a better connection between the fracture networks and the larger interface specific wetting areas which therefore promotes the mass exchange these findings are critical to understanding the migration behavior of radioactive nuclides in far field areas and for the deep geological disposal of nuclear waste keywords solute transport fracture matrix system discrete fracture network mass exchange retardation 1 introduction the flow and transport of solutes contaminants through fractured rocks have become crucial issues mainly due to the rapid development of underground spaces and resources such as high level nuclear waste disposal joyce et al 2014 tsang et al 2015 yang et al 2019 co2 sequestration jenkins et al 2015 and geothermal and hydrocarbon extraction middleton et al 2015 wang et al 2019 compared with the rock matrix fractures have much larger permeabilities and are usually regarded as the predominant pathways for the migration of fluids and solutes therefore an accurate understanding of the coupled flow and transport mechanisms in complex fractured rocks is essential for design construction operation and safety assessment in rock engineering based on the literature representations of complicated and discontinuous fractured rocks are mainly divided into continuous and discrete methods berkowitz 2002 larsson et al 2013 maryška et al 2005 in contrast to the continuous method the discrete fracture network dfn approach has been widely used due to its advantage of explicitly considering the geometry and properties of individual fractures de dreuzy et al 2002 lei et al 2017 long and billaux 1987 long et al 1985 maillot et al 2016 xu and dowd 2010 this representation allows for the prediction of flow and solute transport within discrete fractured rocks in detail cvetkovic and frampton 2012 hyman et al 2015 painter and cvetkovic 2005 painter et al 2002 comparing with two dimensional 2 d dfn the three dimensional 3 d dfn has the outstanding advances of describing the orientation connectivity and permeability of the real rock masses for example huang et al 2016 and lang et al 2014 compared the equivalent permeability of 3 d dfn with the permeability computed on arbitrarily extracted 2 d cut planes their results show that the latter underestimates the magnitude of permeability by up to 3 orders of magnitude this is because there exist some isolated fracture clusters in the 2 d cut planes and there may be even not a single continuous path formed between the inlet and outlet boundary especially for the low fracture density cases therefore the fracture connectivity in 3 d dfn model cannot be accurately captured by their 2 d cut planes or 2 d dfn model and it is essential to conduct fluid flow and solute transport simulation in 3 d fracture networks based on the 3 d dfn method extensive investigations have been conducted to evaluate transport behaviors in complex fractured rocks including laboratory tests pastore et al 2015 suzuki et al 2019 and numerical simulations berrone et al 2018 cvetkovic and frampton 2012 frampton and cvetkovic 2011 frampton et al 2019 hyman et al 2015 hyman et al 2016 kang et al 2020 makedonska et al 2016 sherman et al 2020 wu et al 2021 as for the experimental aspect pastore et al 2015 created an artificially fractured rock and carried out experiments to observe the flow and heat transport behavior their results indicate that heat migration can be significantly delayed by the presence of a non darcian flow regime using 3 d printing technology suzuki et al 2019 made a complex dfn physical model and then conducted tracer transport experiments they found that the breakthrough curve btc was in a good agreement with the numerical simulation results suggesting that the 3 d printed fracture network model can be used for flow and transport simulations although the evolution of the solute concentration can be measured at the outlet direct observations of the transport mechanism inside the fracture network using experimental methods are usually impossible because the printing material is not transparent and ensuring well controlled monitoring conditions is difficult in this case numerical techniques have been further developed to evaluate and capture the flow and transport behavior inside 3 d fractured rocks hyman et al 2015 developed a computational suite dfnworks to generate a stochastic 3 d dfn then they applied pflotran to obtain the flow solutions and used a lagrangian based approach to simulate the transport in 3 d fractured rocks they further investigated the impacts of several key parameters such as the correlations between the fracture size transmissivity hyman et al 2016 and fracture density sherman et al 2020 on the transport properties in a 3 d dfn they found that an earlier breakthrough time can be obtained when the fracture size and transmissivity correlations or the increasing fracture density are considered makedonska et al 2016 and frampton et al 2019 investigated the influence of the variability of the internal aperture on anomalous transport in a 3 d dfn they found that the variability of the internal aperture in a 3 d dfn causes preferential flow channeling generally decreased early arrival times and delayed bulk mass arrival kang et al 2020 carried out 3 d dfn simulations of fluid flow and solute transport to explore the combined effects of the tracer injection mode and fracture aperture heterogeneity their results demonstrated that the interplay between the injection mode and the aperture heterogeneity can result in strong early arrival and long tails in the btcs ngo et al 2017 proposed an efficient workflow for transport simulations in large scale 3 d dfns which uses frac for the conforming meshing and the open source program dumux for simulating the solute transport berrone et al 2018 presented a partial differential equation pde constrained optimization formulation to perform steady state fluid flow and unsteady transport simulations in complex 3 d dfns the simulation results of ngo et al 2017 and berrone et al 2018 suggest that the eulerian approach is an appropriate approach and it can directly capture the overall development of the solute plumes within the fracture network the aforementioned studies were restricted to simulations of 3 d dfns however natural fractured rocks are basically composed of a fracture network and porous rock and it is well known that the interactions between fractures and the surrounding rock matrix have profound influences on the transport behavior especially on long time scales grisak and pickens 1980 neretnieks 1980 sudicky and frind 1982 tang et al 1981 therefore it is important to consider the effect of the mass exchange between the fractures and rock matrix to obtain a more accurate prediction of the solute transport behavior in fractured rocks in engineering applications in recent years research on solute transport in fracture matrix systems has been carried out using numerical simulations zou et al 2017a 2017b investigated the properties of the flow and transport in a 3 d rough walled fracture matrix system with matrix surrounding a single fracture or two intersecting fractures their results demonstrated the significant effects of matrix diffusion under low velocity conditions especially in the zones around the contact spots abdelghani et al 2015 studied the effect of the fracture network characteristics on unsaturated water flow and mining waste contaminant transport in a two dimensional 2d fractured rock with an orthogonal fracture network the evolution of the concentration distribution was found to exhibit strong interactions between the fracture network and the rock matrix on long time scales as for more complex fractured rocks embedded with 3 d dfns li et al 2020 examined the effect of the diffusion coefficient of the rock matrix on the variability of the saturated flow and the solute transport in 3 d fractured rocks using a coupling model they demonstrated that the diffusion coefficient of the rock matrix alters the overall transport behaviors of the solutes suggesting that the diffusion coefficient of the rock matrix should not be ignored when trying to obtain a precise prediction ma et al 2019 simulated and analyzed solute transport in complicated 3 d fractured rocks using the unified pipe network method upm in their study the fracture matrix system was meshed using the constrained delaunay discretization method wang et al 2017 their results showed that the mass exchange between the dfn and the rock matrix can be efficiently evaluated using the conforming vertices on the fracture matrix interface between the triangular and tetrahedral elements recently hyman and dentz 2021 investigated the combined effect of flow heterogeneity and matrix diffusion on solute transport using an upscaled ctrw model in their model the diffusive mass transfer between fracture and matrix was quantified by a compound poisson process the results from previous studies generally show that the breakthrough tailing was amplified in the presence of matrix diffusion however the transport behaviors in fracture matrix systems were rarely simulated explicitly with considering 3 d fracture networks and the effects of physical processes matrix properties and fracture densities of fracture network on transport have not been systematically analyzed through explicitly numerical simulation the goals of this study are to systematically evaluate the effect of the rock matrix on the fluid flow and solute transport in a complex 3 d fracture matrix system with a stochastic 3 d dfn and to provide insights into the coupled mass exchange between the dfn and the rock matrix to address the coupled flow and solute transport in a 3 d discrete fracture matrix system an efficient numerical simulation workflow is developed then the numerical simulation approach is validated against classical analytical solutions for solute transport in fracture matrix systems with a single fracture and with two parallel fractures after this validation the effects of the rock matrix on the transport behaviors in the fractured rocks based on different physical processes e g advection diffusion sorption and decay different matrix porosities and different fracture densities of dfns are systematically investigated 2 methodology all of the simulations in this study were conducted using the computational suite dfnworks hyman et al 2015 dfnsmeshgenerator3 d wang et al 2017 tetgen si 2015 and opengeosys software kolditz et al 2012a kolditz et al 2012b an efficient workflow was developed to combine the aforementioned software fig 1 the main workflow has three principal parts 1 generation of a 3 d dfn 2 mesh generation of a 3 d discrete fracture matrix system and 3 flow and transport calculations the coupling between the three parts is fully automated and does not require the user actions needed when using various python scripts the coupled workflow is briefly introduced below 2 1 generation of the 3 d dfn the stochastic 3 d dfn modeling approach is one common simulation tool used to represent geometrically complex fracture systems due to the uncertainties of the geometrical data obtained from the field measurements using borehole logging or outcrop mapping in the stochastic dfn methodology the fractures are assumed to be circular disks elliptic plates or polygons and the fracture characteristics such as the fracture location orientation size and aperture are assumed to follow their own distributions which can be obtained via a large number of field measurements then based on the principle of monte carlo simulation and the fracture properties a stochastic 3 d dfn can be reproduced frampton and cvetkovic 2011 hyman et al 2014 lei et al 2017 maillot et al 2016 xu and dowd 2010 frampton and cvetkovic 2011 hyman et al 2014 lei et al 2017 maillot et al 2016 xu and dowd 2010 the 3 d dfn model in this study was generated using the dfngen module of dfnworks hyman et al 2015 a feature rejection algorithm for meshing fram hyman et al 2014 was used when generating the 3 d dfn it should be noted that a prescribing minimum feature size h was used in the fram algorithm to restrict the generation of the dfn by only creating features of this size or larger and therefore this setting resolves the obstacles of meshing a dfn containing arbitrarily small features further information about this module can be found in hyman et al 2014 2015 in addition all of the isolated fractures in the dfn models were eliminated during the generation process and only the backbone of the dfn was used to conduct the flow and transport analysis the effect of the isolated fractures will be considered in future research because the diffusion process in a rock matrix is an important factor in our research in this study the fractures were represented by circular disks within a cubic domain with a side length of 15 m the fracture radii r m were sampled from a truncated power law distribution with exponent α and upper and lower cut offs ru r0 we selected α 1 8 a lower cut off of 2 m and an upper cut off of 10 m the power law relationship between the fracture aperture and the fracture size is a common assumption in dfn models bogdanov et al 2007 de dreuzy et al 2002 frampton and cvetkovic 2010 hyman et al 2016 joyce et al 2014 sherman et al 2020 wellman et al 2009 in this study the relationship was set to b 5 0 10 4 r sherman et al 2020 and the fracture permeability is defined by k b 2 12 based on the cubic law therefore the hydraulic aperture varies among the fractures with the larger fractures having wider hydraulic apertures than the smaller fractures for this model setup however the variations in each fracture caused by the aperture roughness are not considered here for simplicity the fracture orientation is defined by the fisher distribution in order to create a disordered network we set the concentration parameter to κ 0 1 which is the same value used by sherman et al 2020 the network s density was represented by a classical parameter p30 which is defined as the ratio between the total number of fractures and the domain volume three increasing fracture densities with p30 0 00089 0 0036 and 0 011 1 m3 were considered fig 2 shows the generated 3 d dfn models with different fracture densities which are denoted as d1 d2 and d3 respectively the aperture values for the different fractures are also shown in fig 2 as can be seen from fig 2 the dfn model becomes more complex and better connected as the density increases moreover for all dfn models at least one set of fractures connects the two opposite model boundaries 2 2 mesh generation of a 3 d discrete fracture matrix system as shown in fig 1 there are three main steps to obtaining the final mesh for the 3 d discrete fracture matrix system the triangular meshing of the 3 d dfn and the six boundary surfaces of the rock matrix is the critical step before the tetrahedral meshing of the rock matrix once the 3 d dfn model is generated the fracture parameters such as the fracture radii the fracture normal vector and the translation of the dfn are automatically converted to the input file for triangular meshing then the meshing is performed using the open source toolbox dfnsmeshgenerator3 d wang et al 2017 to create conforming delaunay triangulation of the 3 d dfn and the matrix surfaces the conforming delaunay triangulation algorithm was applied to preserve the intersection between any two intersecting fractures using this algorithm an adaptive triangular mesh can be generated and the mesh can be optionally coarsened away from the fracture interactions by a predefined coarser factor the ratio of the maximum to minimum mesh sizes in order to preserve the computational resources in order to preserve the meshes of the 3 d dfn when meshing the rock matrix the six boundary surfaces of the matrix should be considered when performing the triangulation mesh with this consideration the sensitive position such as the interaction line of the fracture and boundary matrix can also be refined since it plays an important role in the flow and transport processes the detailed triangular meshes of the dfn and matrix surfaces are shown in fig 3 it shows that the meshes in the interaction areas are denser the refinement optimizes the physical processes that occur in the fracture interaction areas such as decreases in the pressure gradient and the velocity after the generation of the triangular meshes tetrahedralization of the rock matrix is performed the major difficulty in meshing the 3 d fractured rock matrix is to recover and validate the topological information and the triangular meshes of the 3 d dfn in this study the efficient open source software tetgen si 2015 was used to carry out the tetrahedralization the detailed methodology of tetgen is described in the user s manual in tetgen a set of non intersecting 3 d piecewise linear complexes plcs are described in the input files which includes the node list facet list hole list and region list due to the strict requirements for the geometric relationships verbree 2006 of the plcs we used the triangular elements of the fractures and the matrix surfaces fig 3a to construct the input plcs thus the input geometry can be divided into two parts the node list and the facet list of the triangular elements in this study version 1 6 of tetgen was used in addition the y switch was used to preserve the input boundary faces of the plcs when performing the tetrahedral meshing therefore the tetrahedral elements were automatically adapted and conformed to the triangular mesh of the fracture and matrix surfaces fig 3b finally the mesh model of the 3 d discrete fracture matrix system can be obtained using the data transformation of the final triangular and tetrahedral meshes furthermore the mesh model can be converted for visualization or for use as finite element meshes for flow and transport simulations in this study a series of python scripts were developed to generate vtk format files for visualization in paraview henderson and ahrens 2006 and msh format files were generated for flow transport simulation in opengeosys ogs kolditz et al 2012a kolditz et al 2012b 2 3 flow and transport simulations the fluid flow process in fractures is modeled by solving the reynolds equation which has been widely used to simulate the laminar fluid flow through fractures brown 1987 1 x b 3 12 μ p x y b 3 12 μ p y 0 where μ is the dynamic viscosity pa s b is the fracture aperture m and p is the pressure pa as shown in fig 4 the two boundary conditions on the fracture matrix system for flow simulation were considered the first boundary is the fixed pressure on the inlet face sin and the outlet face sout and the other boundary is the neumann zero flux condition on the other four impermeable faces sim 2a p s in p 1 2b p s out p 2 2c n p s im 0 where n is the direction normal to the boundary surface in this study to systematically investigate the properties of the solute transport in a fracture matrix system the physical mechanisms such as advection and dispersion in the fracture diffusion and decay in the fracture matrix system sorption on the fracture surface and matrix were involved for steady state flow through a 3 d fracture matrix system with constant material parameters the above mentioned processes are governed by the following differential equation kolditz et al 2012a kolditz et al 2012b ma et al 2019 which couples the mass exchange between the fracture and matrix automatically 3 θ π

calculate the concentration distribution while considering decay and sorption with a linear henry isotherm the retardation coefficient r represents the effect of sorption on the fracture surface and the rock matrix and for the henry isotherm r is defined as follows 4a r f 1 2 k f b 4b r m 1 ρ b k m θ m where k f is the distribution coefficient of the fracture m k m is the distribution coefficient

publications of ogs kolditz et al 2012a kolditz et al 2012b kolditz et al 2018 the detailed validation tests of the proposed workflow of the simulation method are presented in appendix a 3 results and discussion the proposed numerical workflow was applied to systematically investigate the coupled properties of the fluid flow and solute transport in a 3 d discrete fracture matrix system considering the effects of the different physical processes different matrix porosities and different fracture densities the modeling schemes and discussion of the result are presented below 3 1 modeling schemes and parameter settings the 3 d dfn model used to study the effects of the different physical processes and the different matrix properties is the model d2 with a fracture density of p30 0 0036 1 m3 the detailed modeling scheme are presented in table 1 as shown in table 1 whether sorption or decay are considered is the main setting for the study of different physical process and the cases are denoted as p1 p2 and p3 respectively in the second simulation scenario the matrix porosity was set to 0 01 0 05 and 0 1 which are denoted as m1 m2 and m3 for comparison a simulation without considering the rock matrix was also conducted which is denoted as m0 in addition the d1 d2 and d3 generated in section 2 1 were used for the simulations with different fracture densities the flux weighted concentration c f obtained from the numerical results can be expressed as a ratio of the total solute mass to the surface area of downstream 7a c f c d y d z d y d z to enable convenient comparison of the results the concentration and time was normalized as follows 7b c c f c 0 7c t u t l where t is the dimensionless time or the pore volume pv u is the mean flow velocity of the fractures m s and l is the length of the rock matrix m note that the pv here represents the unit time for the fluid fills the overall fracture void space the physical parameters and settings of the boundary conditions used for the simulations are presented in table 2 and are shown in fig 3b in addition the permeability in the rock matrix was assumed to be 1 0 10 15 m2 according to the site test ma et al 2019 3 2 the effects of matrix diffusion sorption and decay fig 4 illustrates the flow field inside the dfn and the pressure field inside the dfn and the rock matrix for p3 which are the same as in p1 and p2 due to the extremely low permeability in the rock matrix the calculated velocity in the matrix is almost zero for simplicity the velocity results in the rock matrix are not demonstrated in this study as can be seen from fig 4a due to the discontinuities and irregularities of the fracture networks and the varied apertures of the different fractures the iso surface of the pressure inside the dfn exhibits an uneven distribution resulting in a highly heterogeneous and anisotropic pressure distribution in the rock matrix fig 4b 4c fig 4d displays the corresponding flow field in the dfn note that the velocity shown in fig 4d is the resultant velocity and the value is the module of the velocity vector in fig 4d the contours represent the flow velocity warmer colors indicate higher values and blue colors represent lower values regions with significantly high flow i e the fractures close to the inlet and the low flow i e the fractures with dead ends or fracture edges with non slip boundary conditions can be seen in fig 4d the velocity vectors i e the black arrows show that the flow is coming in through some interactions and going out through other interactions resulting in tortuous flow paths in addition the black arrows form a preferential flow path in the dfn domain which is the main control channel for fluid flow from the inflow boundary to the outflow boundary fig 5 shows the evolution of the concentration in the dfn and the matrix for p3 at t 400 4 000 and 40 000 pv as shown in fig 5a 5c as time progresses the continuously released concentration on the left boundary gradually migrates along the connected fractures with an obvious concentration front and it also penetrates into the rock matrix fig 5e 5f faster transport occurs in the main connected channel than in the other channels this is because the transport process in the main channel is dominated by high velocity advection while the other channels are dominated by low velocity diffusion this is attributed to the matrix diffusion process in which the solutes gradually migrate from the fracture networks into the rock matrix the concentration fields at t 40 000 pv in the dfn and the entire fracture matrix system for the different physical processes are shown in fig 6 the results show that the concentration decreases in both the dfn and the fracture matrix system when sorption and decay are considered this is because the sorption and decay processes can significantly retard the solute transport thus resulting in the solute transport through the fractured rocks taking a longer time as shown in fig 6 the concentration distributions and iso value lines in profile y 5 m at t 40 000 pv show that the solute dissolution plumes of the three models are reduced in a step wise manner for example the plumes in p1 almost migrate everywhere on the profile while there are still some areas that the solutes have not reached for p3 demonstrating the strong retardation effect of the sorption and decay processes the cumulative distribution function cdf curves for the concentration accumulation features c at the outlet downstream boundary of the fracture matrix system for the different physical processes were plotted fig 7 a in order to compare the results and show the long tail of the concentration distribution complementary cumulative distribution function ccdf curves which are equal to one minus the cdf were also plotted fig 7b in this study to further analyze the interplay behaviors between the fractures and matrix log plots of the cdfs and ccdfs at the outlet downstream boundary in the fractures and that in the entire fracture matrix system were plotted respectively fig 7a and 7b as can be seen from fig 7a the cdf of the fractures for p3 the red dashed line increases at an exponential rate after the concentration outbreak when c 10 4 at approximately 250 pv and then it transitions to steady state at about 150 000 pv the red dashed line and 650 000 pv the red solid line for the fractures and the entire fracture matrix system respectively this result demonstrates that it takes a longer time for the fracture matrix system to reach steady state due to the matrix diffusion furthermore the ccdf for p3 in fig 7b show obvious heavier tails for the solute transport in the fracture matrix system compared to the fractures as shown in fig 7a and 7b the cdfs and ccdfs of p2 for the dfn and the fracture matrix system both exhibit delayed arrival times and heavier tailing characteristics than p1 which only considered the advection and diffusion processes these phenomena are mainly due to the retardation effect of the matrix sorption furthermore when the decay process is considered in p3 the resulting ccdfs exhibit heavier tailing which results in a higher ccdf value at steady state fig 7b interestingly the time required to reach the equilibrium state for p3 is much shorter than those of the others this can be explained by the decrease in the concentration of the solute in the fracture matrix system caused by the decay reaction these findings confirm that the physical processes such as sorption and decay significantly contribute to solute retardation in fractured rocks that is relevant to far field migration of radioactive nuclides after deep geological disposal 3 3 effect of matrix porosity in addition to the effects of diffusion sorption and decay various matrix porosities can also influence the transport properties in a 3 d discrete fracture matrix system fig 8 shows the contours and iso value lines of the concentration in the dfn and the rock matrix at steady state as can be seen the concentration plumes in the dfn shrank with increasing porosity in contrast the concentration plumes in the rock matrix expanded significantly when the porosity was increased from 0 01 to 0 1 to evaluate the behavior in the entire fracture matrix system for different porosity values a simulation without considering the rock matrix was also conducted and the cdfs and ccdfs of all of the simulation cases were calculated fig 9 a and 9b as shown in fig 9a when the effect of the rock matrix is ignored solute transport only in the fractures the arrival time for m0 about 0 1pv is almost 1 000 4 000 times earlier than when considering the effect of the rock matrix about 100 400pv it was also determined from the cdfs of the fracture for different matrix porosities that as the porosity decreases the arrival time becomes earlier in contrast the resulting ccdfs of the fractures for different matrix porosities exhibit heavier tailing and the corresponding ccdf values at steady state increase as the porosity increases however compared to those of the fractures the ccdfs of the matrix exhibit a more obvious long tailing as the porosity decreases fig 9b the reasons for the above findings are that the larger porosity of the rock matrix increases the mass exchange at the interface between the dfn and the rock matrix which decreases the concentration in the fractures and thus delays the solute transport in the fractures resulting in heavier tailing moreover the larger porosity of the matrix decreases the retardation effect of the sorption and accelerates the solute transport process in the matrix resulting in earlier arrival times and weaker long tailings for the fracture matrix system these phenomena demonstrate that the matrix porosity plays an important role in solute transport in fracture matrix systems 3 4 effect of fracture density three dfn models with different fracture densities were designed to investigate how the fracture density affects the flow and transport in a 3 d discrete fracture matrix system the comparisons of the results of the pressure and velocity fields are shown in fig 10 as the fracture density increases the pressure distribution in the dfn becomes more heterogeneous and the pressure gradient increases in particular the pressure field in some of the fractures can be suddenly cut off due to discontinuities or dead ends this enhanced heterogeneity was also observed in the matrix as the density increased the corresponding velocity fields in fig 10c 10f and 10i show that as the density increases the connected fractures intersect with more fractures thus resulting in more flow channels and more tortuous flow paths between the inflow and outflow boundaries fig 11 shows the contour maps and iso value lines of concentration in the dfn and rock matrix at steady state for a larger fracture density d3 there are more transport channels and a more heterogeneous concentration distribution occurs which is consistent with the results of the velocity field in the dfn fig 10i it can also be seen that the concentration plumes in the matrix are enhanced as the fracture density increases and results in a more homogeneous concentration distribution in the fracture matrix system for example the plumes in d3 almost migrate everywhere on the profile while there are still some areas that the solutes have not reached in d1 these findings indicate that the fracture density plays an important role in solute transport in fractured rocks that is a faster outbreak of radioactive nuclides may occur in the far field for a fracture network with a higher fracture density the results of the comparison of the cdfs and ccdfs for different fracture densities are shown in fig 12 which illustrates the transport characteristics of the solute transport in the 3 d discrete fracture matrix system as shown in fig 12a for a larger fracture density d3 the arrival time is shorter for both the fractures and the entire fracture matrix system this is due to the fact that a dfn with a larger density is prone to reduce the tortuosity of the preferential transport pathways between the inlet and outlet boundaries resulting in faster migration and earlier arrival of the solutes interestingly as time progresses the cdfs of the model with a larger fracture density d3 are lower than those of the model with a smaller fracture density d1 in addition as shown in fig 12b the resulting ccdfs of the dfn exhibit significantly longer tails and the corresponding ccdf value at steady state is lower for larger fracture densities d3 in contrast the ccdfs of the fracture matrix system exhibit heavier tailing as the density decreases the main reasons for these findings are that the better connected dfn for the case with the larger fracture density increases the interface areas between the fractures and matrix and thus promotes mass exchange between the dfn and the rock matrix resulting in more solutes penetrating into the rock matrix and thus decreasing the solute concentration in the dfn 4 conclusions in this study we systematically investigated the effects of the rock matrix on the transport behavior in a 3 d discrete fracture matrix system with a complex fracture network using an efficient numerical simulation workflow with emphasis on the impacts of physical processes i e advection diffusion sorption and decay the rock matrix porosity and the fracture density the main conclusions drawn from the results of this study are summarized as follows 1 an efficient and fully automated numerical workflow was proposed which includes coupling the generation of the 3 d dfn mesh generation of the 3 d discrete fracture matrix system and flow and transport calculations using a series of python scripts 2 the combined effects of the rock matrix and physical processes were assessed the ccdf curves exhibit heavier tails compared to the results of traditional advection diffusion processes suggesting that the sorption and decay processes play an important role in retarding the migration of solutes in fractured rocks it was also found that a larger matrix porosity increases the mass exchange at the interface between the dfn and the rock matrix and thus increases the contribution of the matrix diffusion 3 case studies of different fracture densities were carried out when the number of fractures in the dfn increased the pressure and flow field in the dfn became more heterogeneous however the concentration plumes in the matrix grew and transitioned to a more homogeneous distribution in addition the simulation results show that more concentration plumes penetrate into the rock matrix demonstrating that a better connected dfn with a larger fracture density increases the interface areas between the dfn and the rock matrix and thus promotes mass exchange these properties are critical for investigating the migration of radioactive nuclides into the far field after deep geological disposal this study demonstrated the importance of rock matrix on transport behaviors in 3 d discrete fracture matrix systems the numerical workflow proposed in this paper can be adopted to systematically analyze contaminant propagation in deterministic fracture networks or large scale stochastic fracture networks based on site investigations for various rock engineering projects such as the assessment of the safety of high level waste underground repositories in future studies we will systematically investigate the influences of the heterogeneity of the internal aperture of the dfn on the flow and solute transport through a 3 d discrete fracture matrix system credit authorship

parallel fracture matrix models and analytical solutions sudicky and frind 1982 tang et al 1981 were used as benchmarks to validate the reliability and feasibility of the proposed numerical workflow a 1 single fracture matrix model for the single fracture matrix model the geometric size was assumed to be 7 0 m 7 0 m 3 0 m and the meshes were generated by the proposed workflow in section 2 2 as shown in fig a1 a the parameters for numerical simulation were identical to the settings in tang et al 1981 which were listed in table a1 the fracture was assumed saturated and a constant head difference was applied between the inlet and outlet of the fracture so as to remain a flow velocity of 0 01 m day the initial and boundary conditions of concentration were described as follows a 1a c ω t 0 0 a 1b c x 0 z 0 t 0 c 0 fig a1 b shows the concentration distribution at steady state in the fracture matrix system the comparison between the simulation results and the anlytical results deriving from tang et al 1981 were plotted in fig a2 fig a2 a shows the concentration profiles along the fracture at 100 days 1000 days and 10000 days the 1 penetration depth d0 01 is 6 66 m based on the analytical solution which was calculated in tang et al 1981 therefore the steady state concentration profiles along the rock matrix at x 1 2 1 4 and 1 10 of d0 01 can be calculated as shown in fig a2 b fig a2 c shows the breakthrough curves for the fracture at the same points generally it can be found that the simulated results based on the proposed numerical workflow in this study agree well with the anlytical results a 2 parallel fracture matrix model for the parallel fracture matrix model the geometric size was set as 80 m 10 m 5 m the fracture spacing was set as 0 5 m and the meshes were generated by the proposed workflow as shown in fig 6 a the parameters for numerical simulation were identical to those listed in table 1 except the flow velocity increased to 0 1 m day the fracture was also assumed saturated and the constant head difference between the inlet and outlet of the fracture was adapt to the updated velocity the initial and boundary conditions of concentration were summarized as follows a 2a c ω t 0 0 a 2b c x 0 z 0 25 m t 0 c 0 fig a3 b shows the concentration distribution at steady state in the fracture matrix system the comparison results were plotted in fig a4 fig a4 a shows the concentration profiles along the fracture at 100 days 1000 days and 10000 days results indicated perfect agreement between the numerical results and analytical rsults at these three times the 1 penetration depth d0 01 for this case is 71 9 m based on the analytical solution from sudicky and frind 1982 fig a4 b c shows the steady state concentration profiles for the rock matrix and the breakthrough curves for the fracture at x 1 2 1 4 and 1 10 of d0 01 respectively it can also be found that the simulation results achieve a well agreement with the analytical results a 3 sensitivity analysis the resolution of meshes and time steps of solutions are two essential factors to reach mesh independency condition and numerical stability of the simulation results under this consideration the mesh size and time step sensitivity analysis procedure for the single fracture matrix model were carried out all the simulation parameters adopted for this verification were identical to table a1 and the results of concentration profiles along rock matrix at 1 2 1 4 and 1 10 of d0 01 at 20000 days were calculated fig a5 a and a5 c shows the results of the mesh size and time step sensitivity analysis to further quantify the differences between the numerical and analytical results for the sensitivity analysis the root mean square error rmse was introduced a 3a rmse i 1 n c num i c ana i 2 n where c num i and c ana i represents the concentration at the ith monitoring points to be compared with the numerical results and the analytical results respectively and n is the number of monitoring points in the concentration profiles the results were replotted in fig a5 b and d as shown in fig a5 b all the rmse values are small than 4 and generally decrease with increasing element numbers except the case with less element numbers 23328 meanwhile fig a5 d indicates that all the rmse values are small than 0 2 when the time steps decrease to 1000 or 500 days the porosity is another important factor that should be analyzed for single fracture matrix model concentrations of the analytical solutions and numerical simulations along the fracture and rock matrix with different porosity values when t 10000 days were presented in fig a6 as shown in fig a6 the results of numerical simulations also agree well with the analytical solution in general the above simulation results agree well with the analytical solutions which severs as a kind of mathematical verification of the numerical model and the proposed numerical workflow furthermore based on the well coupled triangular meshes and tetrahedral meshes between the interface of fractures and rock matrix it is reasonable to deduce that the workflow can accurately quantifying the mass exchange between the fracture and rock matrix and thus it can be concluded that the proposed workflow is feasible and reliable to investigate the coupled flow and solute transport in 3 d discrete fracture matrix
