4710,deep saline aquifer is the preferred reservoir for co2 geological storage however during the primary drainage process of injecting scco2 into deep saline aquifers residual water will form and cannot be drained which will have adverse effects on the capacity and safety of co2 storage this is a new study based on the preliminary exploration 9 groups of scco2 drainage experiments in a natural rock core are carried out under multiple pressure 8 10 and 12 mpa and temperature 40 50 and 60 c conditions to investigate the formation mechanism of residual water during primary drainage process a quantitative power function relationship between residual water saturation and drainage time is proposed a quantitative exponential function relationship between irreducible water saturation and p t conditions is also presented the coefficients a b c and d of two fitting functions are discussed in detail in addition the irreducible water saturation increases with the increase of temperature and decreases with the increase of pressure through deep analysis on the interfacial tension viscosity ratio and logca logm stability phase diagram the interfacial tension of co2 h2o system which determines the capillary entry pressure is regarded as the guiding factor influencing the experimental results rather than the viscosity ratio it is worth mentioning that under the given p t conditions in this study the influence of temperature on the experimental results is greater than that of pressure keywords co2 storage deep saline aquifers primary drainage process residual water quantitative experiments 1 introduction of the various deep underground reservoirs for co2 storage saline aquifers are regarded as preferred ones han et al 2019 geo sequestration of co2 in deep saline aquifers including 3 steps they are brine displaced by co2 the primary drainage process co2 displaced by brine conversely the imbibition process and residual co2 storage capillary or residual trapping of co2 bachu and bennion 2009 bachu 2015 li et al 2017 interactions of co2 water rock play important roles in the whole cycle of co2 geo sequestration tang et al 2020 sun et al 2021 among which the residual water formed during the primary drainage process and the irreducible water saturation play negative roles both in the capacity and in the safety of co2 storage in deep saline aquifers li et al 2017 the more residual water in rock pores the less space left for co2 sequestration besides more residual water will also lead to an accumulation of reservoir pressure during co2 injection thus laying a hidden danger for the occurrence of geological disasters li et al 2017 therefore it is necessary to carry out comprehensive and in depth investigations on the formation mechanisms of residual water and the control effects of various factors on the primary drainage process and irreducible water saturation there are many research results on the core scale two phase flow displacement experiment chalbaud et al 2007 proposed that co2 fluid can easily pass through and occupy rock pore channels and spaces when the residual water saturation reaches the minimum suekane et al 2008 measured 24 8 28 2 of the trapped co2 saturation in the core while pentland et al 2011a 2011b measured higher trapped co2 saturations of 35 37 under almost the same experimental conditions through comparative analysis the difference between the three experimental results is caused by different residual water saturations bennion and bachu 2006 measured the variation range of residual water saturation in different rock samples is 20 82 bennion and bachu 2010 and bachu 2013 measured the residual water saturation 21 0 85 2 and trapped co2 saturation 4 5 41 5 in 29 sandstone and carbonate rock samples kitamura et al 2013 measured a very high residual water saturation of 53 7 in sandstone but the corresponding trapped co2 saturation is very low 5 6 therefore higher residual water saturation in rock pores will lead to lower co2 saturation al zaidi et al 2018a al zaidi et al 2018b al zaidi et al 2019 and al zaidi and fan 2019 injected co2 in gas liquid and supercritical state respectively into saturated sandstone under different temperature pressure injection rate and salinity to study their influences on inlet outlet pressure difference and displacement efficiency however they did not conduct long term displacement experiment to obtain irreducible water saturation some preliminary explorations were carried out on the formation mechanisms of residual water during primary drainage process and the control effects of its influencing factors in the study of li et al 2013 effects of brine concentration on the formation of residual water were investigated it is found that the saturation of residual water increases with the increase of brine concentration a qualitative conclusion meanwhile the formation process of residual water is divided into 3 stages they are the pushing drainage portable drainage and dissolved drainage stages li and yu 2014 carried out studies on the effects of brine species on the formation of residual water in brine co2 systems the order of residual water saturation of brine with different cations is cacl2 nacl deionized water a qualitative conclusion based on analysis the difference of experimental results is attributed to various interfacial tensions in brine co2 systems a capillary model was also proposed to interpret the mechanisms that characterize the 3 stages of drainage process moreover the effects of quartz content on the formation of residual water in a brine co2 quartz system was also carried out by li et al 2015 the results show that the irreducible water saturation was lower with higher quartz content in the rock core a qualitative conclusion as the contact angle the wettability in brine co2 mineral system is ever changing based on the above research li et al 2017 proposed a comprehensive review to identify the influence of residual water saturation on co2 sequestration and factors affecting it these factors include co2 brine interfacial tension ift and related factors which can influence ift contact angles in brine co2 rock systems and related factors which can affect contact angles heterogeneity and mineral composition of rocks mass the permeability and porosity of the aquifer two phase equilibrium and co2 injection rate and duration however these factors are inferred qualitatively from lots of two phase displacement experiments and cannot quantitatively reveal the formation mechanisms of residual water as well as the control effects of various influencing factors it is worth mentioning that li and yu 2020 quantitatively reveals the effect mechanism of initial pore water saturation on co2 breakthrough pressure time through numerical simulation it is found that both breakthrough pressure and breakthrough time are exponentially related to the initial water saturation of rock core nevertheless this conclusion is only applicable to the first stage of the primary drainage process that is the pushing drainage stage based on the above preliminary explorations we carry out a new research focusing on the properties of two phase fluid in this study in addition to the concentration and species of brine the key factor that can change the properties of two phase fluid is the p t conditions throughout the experiment p t conditions can change the interfacial tension of co2 h2o system contact angle in co2 h2o mineral system viscosity of two phase fluid and even the fingering type viscosity fingering capillary fingering or stable displacement of displacement 9 groups of drainage experiments under multiple pressures 8 10 and 12 mpa and temperatures 40 50 and 60 c are conducted to investigate p t effects on primary drainage process and residual water two quantitative fitting functions are presented in this study the dominant factor affecting primary drainage process is also identified based on detailed discussions this study can help the actual co2 geo sequestration projects select the optimal target reservoir both temperature and pressure conditions are appropriate or inject fluids into deep underground in the best state with a purpose to reduce residual water and increase co2 storage capacity 2 experimental materials and methods 2 1 rock core the rock core used in this study is a natural rock core extracted from the deep strata triassic yanchang formation with a depth of 949 m shown in fig 1 of ccs project 2 monitoring well in ordos basin which is the second largest sedimentary basin in china and has great potential for large scale co2 geological storage this rock core is a standard cylinder with a length of 30 mm and a diameter of 25 mm fig 2 we can see from fig 2 that this rock core shows general homogeneity and absence of micro fractures based on visual inspection and it maintains its mechanical integrity in order to have a better understanding of this rock core x ray diffraction electron microscopy field emission scanning electron microscopy fe sem and conventional mercury injection tests were carried out for the x ray diffraction its principle is to strike x ray at different positions angles of minerals and set the intensity of the minerals to judge the type and percentage content of minerals according to the peak shape formed the results showed that the content of quartz was 63 1 albite 25 5 ordovicite 8 6 and muscovite 2 8 fig 3 as for fig 3 abscissa represents the angle and ordinate represents the intensity dimensionless the photographs of electron microscopy a and fe sem b are shown in fig 4 microscopically it can be observed that the rocks mainly consist of quartz feldspar and rock fragments or fillings quartz is granular colorless and transparent it is mainly in the form of sub angular it has wavy extinction and a few micro cracks the particle size of quartz is 0 10 0 90 mm it is mainly of coarse and medium grain size and has directional distribution feldspar is slab like mainly in sub angular shape a small number of visible cracks particle size is in the range of 0 25 0 80 mm directional distribution mica is flaky and polychromatic with the flake diameters of 0 05 0 20 mm the amount of rock fragments or fillings is very small some siliceous fragments are classified as quartz according to the national standard the two photos in fig 4 a are the front and reverse photographs of core slices the scale in 200 μm is marked in the lower left corner in order to show the structure of the pore more clearly the fe sem images of the three dimensional structure without polishing are given in fig 4 b the magnification of the fe sem images is much larger than that of the electron microscope images the scale of 2 μm is also given at the lower side according to fe sem images obvious pore channels can be seen based on the conventional mercury injection tests the gas permeability of 8 71 md the porosity of 17 88 and the density of 2 16 g cm3 for the rock core is obtained the maximum pore throat radius is 13 36 μm the average pore throat radius is 3 36 μm and the median pore throat radius is 0 40 μm respectively according to fig 5 the pore throat radius is uniformly distributed in the range of 0 0025 16 00 μm and reaches the maximum pore throat distribution frequency of 9 99 at 6 30 μm the shadow section besides the peak of permeability contribution is 47 13 at 10 00 μm the curve section therefore according to visual observation and various analysis on this rock core it can be inferred that there are no obvious fissures joints and fillings in it which can be approximately considered that the rock core is homogeneous and isotropic 2 2 experimental apparatus and methods the experimental apparatus used in this study is the multi functional physical simulation experimental device under geological storage conditions as shown in figs 6 and 7 the multi functional physical simulation experimental device can simulate the permeation process of gas and liquid fluids in rock media under different temperatures and pressures with the help of the latest achievements of modern science and technology such as computer technology and advanced sensor technology the core flooding experiments are carried out this apparatus also provides technical support for improving co2 storage efficiency and effect and provides data preparation for numerical simulation technology the device consists of the following 6 systems 1 vacuum extraction system 2 gas injection system 3 liquid injection system 4 core holder system 5 confining and back pressure system 6 measurement system for more information please refer to preliminary study of li and yu 2014 in geological storage co2 is stored in a high density super critical state because this high density liquid can make full use of the pore space in aquifer rocks zuo et al 2012 in order to simulate the actual storage conditions the experiments were carried out under 9 different combinations of temperatures and pressures shown in table 1 these p t conditions are all higher than the critical points of 7 38 mpa and 31 1 c suekane et al 2008 for co2 the residual or irreducible water saturation is calculated as 1 s wrr m 2 m 0 m 1 m 0 where swrr is the residual or irreducible water saturation m0 is the dry weight of rock core g m1 is the saturated weight of rock core g m2 is the residual weight of rock core g after co2 displacement of water li et al 2013 2015 2017 li and yu 2014 in the experiments the electronic balance is used to weigh the mass of core samples and the displaced water the reading accuracy reaches the last two decimal points before the first use of the rock core the rock core should be placed in the core holder and washed with deionized water with a high flow rate at high p t conditions to remove the unstable rock particles and open the unstable pore channels until there are no rock particles washed out the specific experimental steps are as follows all operation methods strictly follow the routine methods for core analysis of the oil and gas industry in china professional standard sy t 5336 2006 1 before the start of each drainage experiment the dry weight m0 and the saturated weight m1 of the rock core should be accurately weighed and recorded please refer to li and yu 2014 and li et al 2015 for more details 2 the rock core saturated with deionized water is put into the core holder the temperature of the thermostat is set to 40 50 60 c and the co2 pressure in the gas tank is increased to 10 12 14 mpa 2 mpa greater than the back pressure of the holder so as to ensure that co2 in the gas tank is in super critical state and can easily displace the water deionized water is then injected into the core and the back and circumferential pressure are increased to 8 10 12 mpa and 20 mpa step by step when the pressure at the outlet of the core holder reaches 8 10 12 mpa the water injection is stopped 3 the super critical co2 in the gas tank is then injected into the core holder the injection pressure is controlled by the gas pressurization system the pressure difference between the inlet and outlet of core holder is about 1 mpa because co2 flooding belongs to dynamic flooding the actual injection rate varies before co2 breaks through the gripper and escapes the flow rate of water discharged from the core by co2 is basically constant it takes about 1 h to reach this point which is called the breakthrough point there are also parts of the pipeline between the gas tank and the core holder between the core holder and the back pressure filled with water which accumulates during the water injection process the water in these pipes cannot be displaced completely within the 1st hour and the exact amount of the water is unknown therefore the residual water saturation at the breakthrough point cannot be calculated only according to the mass of the displaced water collected in the gas liquid separator when calculating the residual water saturation at this time point the core can be carefully taken out and its residual weight m2 can be accurately weighed and the residual water saturation at this time can be calculated according to equation 1 note that the core holder needs to be depressurized at a very slow speed before the core is removed so as to avoid the flow of liquid in the pore as much as possible at this time the supercritical co2 in the core will become gaseous and dissipate in the air due to decompression 4 with all the experimental conditions unchanged the residual water saturations at 3 and 6 h were calculated by repeating steps 1 3 the reason why core is also taken out and weighed at the time nodes of 3 and 6 h is that the water in the pipeline has not been completely transferred to the liquid collecting device during this period 5 under the same experimental conditions steps 1 3 were repeated this time the experiment lasted from 0 to 120 h during which the rock core was not taken out and weighed it has been verified by tests that the water in the pipeline of the instrument will be completely removed or dried after about 6 h therefore the mass of all the water displaced is the sum of the mass of the water collected in the gas liquid separator and the mass increment of the silica gel desiccant the quality of these two parts of water is obtained at each time node of 9 12 24 36 48 60 and 120 h at the end of the experiment it is necessary to unload the back pressure to the atmospheric pressure at a very slow speed so that the co2 in the rock core can escape through decompression and avoid the flow of liquid in the rock core to the maximum extent then the core was carefully removed from the core holder and its residual weight at 120 h was weighed when calculating the saturation of residual water the mass of water discharged from the instrument pipeline should be subtracted from the total mass of collected water which can be obtained by comparing the difference between the mass of water discharged from the rock core saturation weight minus residual weight and the mass of water collected weight gain of gas liquid separator plus silica gel desiccant firstly the residual weight at 120 h is calculated and then the residual weight m2 at each time node from 60 to 9 h is deduced step by step in each experiment we did not consider the equilibrium of phase states as 1 the water dissolved in scco2 will be absorbed by silica gel desiccant and finally be considered into the calculation of residual water saturation 2 co2 dissolved in water will be released at the end of the experiment and become gaseous when the core is taken out at an extremely slow speed and then dissipate in the air therefore we can infer that the mass conversion between scco2 and water will not have a great impact on the experimental results moreover before the start of each new experiment the core should be dried and saturated again to accurately weigh its dry weight and saturated weight so as to avoid the error caused by the falling off of rock cuttings and allow us to calculate and verify the porosity and permeability of the core again the verification results show that after repeated use the porosity and permeability of the artificial core do not change li and yu 2014 li et al 2015 therefore in order to avoid experimental errors caused by using different cores we can use only one core throughout the experiments 3 results and discussion 3 1 results take experiment 1 8 mpa 40 c as an example the curve of drainage flow rate with time is shown in fig 8 it can be seen from this curve that the whole primary drainage process can be divided into 3 stages which is exactly consistent with the conclusions of li et al 2013 li and yu 2014 and li et al 2015 that is the pushing drainage portable drainage and dissolved drainage stages the pushing drainage stage starts from the beginning of drainage experiments until the gas is ejected from the outlet in this stage the drainage flow rate is relatively large which can be used to calculate and determine the fingering type showing in fig 13 moreover the water displaced in this stage can fall into the container on the electronic balance and its mass can be measured accurately during the first stage most of the pore water is pushed out of rock pores by scco2 so we have named this stage the pushing drainage stage in experiment 1 this stage lasted about 1 h with an average flow rate of 0 00024 ml s capillary force or hydrophilicity of minerals in drainage process prevent the water from being dried small amounts of water remain on the surface of the rock grains as bound or adsorptive water meanwhile some water is retained as pore angular capillary water between rock grains this part of water can be removed by being entrained in scco2 the water removed in this process were either enveloped or dissolved in scco2 and its amount is small the second step of the curve shown in fig 8 this water would not be collected in the liquid container but is released into the air after the fluids leave the rock core and then was absorbed by the silica gel dryer this stage 0 65 h in experiment 1 is then named as the portable drainage stage however some stable pore angular capillary water between the grains cannot be driven out during the previous two drainage stages in the third stage the residual pore angular capillary water may only be removed by being dissolved in scco2 the solubility of h2o in co2 is very small under p t conditions in this study spycher et al 2003 for all practical purposes we can ignore the negligible amount of water being discharged at this stage that is the dissolved drainage stage lasts throughout the whole drainage process therefore we can set the terminal point of drainage at the end of portable drainage stage the second stage and the residual water saturation at this point can be regarded as the irreducible water saturation this is basically the case in all 9 groups of drainage experiments curves of residual water saturation with drainage time and the results of irreducible water saturation are shown in fig 9 among them fig 9 a shows the results of drainage process under the same pressure of 8 10 and 12 mpa with various temperatures while fig 9 b shows the results under the same temperature of 40 50 and 60 c with various pressures in these drainage experiments water saturations in rock core decrease from 1 immediately during the primary drainage process with the extension of drainage time the decreasing trend of residual water saturation gradually slows down until it remains unchanged the irreducible water saturations for 9 groups of drainage experiments are 0 446 8 mpa 40 c 0 503 8 mpa 50 c 0 578 8 mpa 60 c 0 397 10 mpa 40 c 0 495 10 mpa 50 c 0 549 10 mpa 60 c 0 396 12 mpa 40 c 0 468 12 mpa 50 c and 0 546 12 mpa 60 c respectively fig 10 shows the quantitative relationship between irreducible water saturation and p t conditions the higher the temperature is the higher the residual or irreducible water saturation is the higher the pressure is the lower the residual or irreducible water saturation is 3 2 discussion the variation trend of residual water saturation in all experiments can be fitted as a quantitative power function that is 2 s w a t b where sw refers to the residual water saturation t refers to the drainage time and a b are the fitting coefficients the coefficient of determination r2 is large in all curves which demonstrates that the relationships are all reasonable as the base of power function cannot be 0 therefore the point of time 0 saturation of 1 does not appear in figures based on the analysis of the coefficients a b in these equations it can be seen that when the pressure is constant and the temperature changes fig 9 a the variation of a is very small and irregular it can be considered that a does not change and b decreases with the increase of temperature however when the temperature is constant and the pressure changes fig 9 b a decreases with the increase of pressure and the variation of b is very small and irregular it can be considered that b does not change moreover by comparing figures a and b it can be seen that the influence of temperature on the evolution trend of residual water saturation is greater than that of pressure which can be deduced from the spacing of curves based on fig 10 the quantitative exponential function relationship between the irreducible water saturation and the p t conditions are given as 3 s w c e dx where x refers to temperature or pressure c d are the fitting coefficients r2 is large enough to demonstrates that the relationships are reasonable when x represents the temperature the coefficient d is positive when x represents the pressure the coefficient d is negative through the analysis of fig 10 it can be seen that for x representing the temperature the coefficient c decreases with the increase of pressure while the coefficient d a positive number has no obvious change regularities in addition when x represents the pressure the coefficient c increases with the increase of temperature and the absolute value of coefficient d decreases with the increase of temperature moreover by comparing figures a and b it also can be deduced from the spacing of curves that the influence of temperature on irreducible water saturation is greater than that of pressure 3 2 1 ift effects on experimental results in order to further study the fundamental factors leading to different residual water saturations the interfacial tension ift and the viscosity ratio m of co2 h2o system which are greatly affected by the multiple p t conditions and play a decisive role in the primary drainage process li et al 2017 are investigated according to fig 11 ift decreases with the increase of pressure and increases with the increase of temperature bachu and bennion 2009 in general the irreducible water saturation increases with the increase of ift which can be explained by the laplace equation 4 p c 2 γ b c o 2 cos θ r where pc is the co2 capillary entry pressure γb co2 is the ift between brine and co2 θ is the brine co2 rock contact angle and r is the effective pore throat radius in the porous medium li et al 2017 as the contact angle θ is very complicated there has been no unified law of θ variation with p t conditions on various media particles surface meanwhile cos θ only varies from 0 to 1 which is very small compared with ift it is not necessary for us to take θ as the dominant factor that affecting the drainage process li and yu 2014 li et al 2015 moreover the effective pore throat radius r is constant one rock core we only take ift as the main factor affecting the laplace equation under such p t conditions in this study the higher the ift the higher the capillary entry pressure pc the more difficult for the displacement then the higher the irreducible water saturation in addition based on the fitting formulas it can be found that the influence of temperature variation fig 11 b on the polynomial slope is much greater than that of pressure variation fig 11 a therefore it is confirmed again that the influence of temperature on primary drainage process is greater than that of pressure under p t conditions in this study 3 2 2 viscosity ratio effects on experimental results viscosity ratio which is affected by p t conditions obviously can also be a main factor that influencing the primary drainage process li et al 2017 it is defined as 5 m μ i μ d where m is the viscosity ratio μi is the viscosity of displacing fluid co2 μpa s μd is the viscosity of displaced fluid h2o μpa s basirat et al 2017 based on fig 12 it can be seen that when the temperature is constant the higher the pressure is the greater the two phase viscosity ratio is and the smaller the irreducible water saturation is fig 12 a when the pressure is constant the higher the temperature is the lower the two phase viscosity ratio is and the greater the irreducible water saturation is however experiments of 8 mpa are exceptions with the increase of temperature the viscosity ratio increases and the irreducible water saturation increases fig 12 b moreover according to the fitting polynomial the effect of changing pressures on the polynomial slope fig 12 a is obviously less than that of changing temperatures fig 12 b again it confirms that the influence of temperature on primary drainage process is greater than that of pressure under p t conditions in this study note that the viscosities of two phase fluids are based on the data given by the website of https webbook nist gov chemistry fluid 3 2 3 establishment of logca logm stability phase diagram based on the above discussion we can see that both the interfacial tension and the viscosity ratio of co2 h2o system have important influences on primary drainage process moreover as the effects of viscosity ratio on irreducible water saturation has an exception of experiments under 8 mpa we use logca logm stability phase diagram to further analyze the dominant factor affecting the primary drainage process ca is the capillary number which can be defined as 6 c a μ i v γ b c o 2 where μi is the viscosity of displacing fluid co2 pa s v is the darcy velocity m s γb co2 is the ift between h2o co2 n m 1 note that this equation does not include the effect of wettability i e contact angle θ basirat et al 2017 akhlaghi and hamouda 2014 mapped the displacement regimes on a logca logm stability phase diagram within which 3 flow regimes viscosity fingering capillary fingering and stable displacement are recognized by tuning m and ca fig 13 is the diagram promoted by akhlaghi and hamouda 2014 on the basis of previous study of zhang et al 2011 which took care of errors due to uncertainties and then delimits the boundary this diagram shows that for different values of ca and m i e viscous or capillary dominant flow heterogeneity will affect fluid displacement in different ways it can be seen by mapping points on this diagram that the logca logm values of the 9 experiments all fall in the region of capillary fingering the values of logca are in the range of 6 33 5 39 while the values of logm are in the range of 1 47 1 05 which demonstrates that the capillary force is the guiding force in all 9 drainage experiments in other words the main influencing factors of the 9 groups of drainage experiments can be explained by the laplace equation i e the ift of co2 h2o system rather than the viscosity ratio 3 2 4 control effects of p t conditions on primary drainage processes in combination with the above conclusions the study of brennan 2014 has shown much greater storage efficiencies for deep storage formations with high pressures and temperatures compared to shallow formations this is related to the much stronger influence of pressure on ift and for this reason even if high temperature enhances the ift that influence is compensated by the much greater ift reduction caused by high pressures however in this study the effects of temperature on drainage process or the ift are greater than that of pressure although this conclusion is contrary to the study of brennan 2014 it can be explained by fig 14 li et al 2017 with regard to temperature fig 14 a ift noticeably increases with increasing temperature 40 60 c and this increment gradually reduces with increasing temperature after 60 c while in fig 14 b ift greatly decreases with increasing pressure to some extent definitely before 10 mpa and here after the pressure does not have any significant influence on ift the temperature range in this study is between 40 and 60 c just in the sharp rise stage of a while the pressure is in the range of 8 12 mpa which has tended to the gentle stage of b which confirms that temperature has a greater effect on the experimental results than that of pressure under the p t conditions in this study precisely we will carry out more drainage experiments with wider range of multiple p t conditions in the future to verify this inference 4 conclusions as residual water plays an important role in the storage capacity and safety evaluation of co2 storage in deep underground especially saline aquifers it is necessary to investigate the primary drainage process and the formation mechanisms of residual water under the control of various influencing factors based on previous studies we carried out a new study on 9 groups of drainage experiments under multiple p t conditions to quantitatively study the main factors that affect the drainage process and irreducible water saturation the conclusions are as follows the irreducible water saturations for 9 groups of drainage experiments are 0 446 8 mpa 40 c 0 503 8 mpa 50 c 0 578 8 mpa 60 c 0 397 10 mpa 40 c 0 495 10 mpa 50 c 0 549 10 mpa 60 c 0 396 12 mpa 40 c 0 468 12 mpa 50 c and 0 546 12 mpa 60 c respectively the higher the temperature is the higher the residual or irreducible water saturation is the higher the pressure is the lower the residual or irreducible water saturation is the variation trend of residual water saturation sw with drainage time t in all experiments can be fitted as a quantitative power function that is sw a t b when the temperature changes the variation of a is very small and irregular it can be considered that a does not change and b decreases with the increase of temperature when the pressure changes a decreases with the increase of pressure and the variation of b is very small and irregular it can be considered that b does not change also a quantitative exponential function relationship between the irreducible water saturation and the p t conditions is given as sw c edx when x represents the temperature coefficient d is positive the coefficient c decreases with the increase of pressure while the coefficient d has no obvious change regularities when x represents the pressure coefficient d is negative the coefficient c increases with the increase of temperature and the absolute value of d decreases with the increase of temperature as for the values determination on a b c and d under various p t conditions more experiments are needed through the analysis of interfacial tension and viscosity ratio in co2 h2o systems it can be seen that 1 the higher the ift the higher the capillary entry pressure pc the more difficult for the displacement then the higher the irreducible water saturation 2 the higher the pressure the greater the two phase viscosity ratio and the smaller the irreducible water saturation the higher the temperature the lower the two phase viscosity ratio and the larger the irreducible water saturation nevertheless experiments under 8 mpa are exceptions 3 based on the logca logm stability phase diagram the data points of 9 experiments all fall in the area of capillary fingering the values of logca are in the range of 6 33 5 39 while the values of logm are in the range of 1 47 1 05 which indicates that the capillary force is the dominant factor influencing the two phase flow in this study so the laplace equation should be adopted to clarify the experimental results under the multiple p t conditions in this study the influence of temperature on the experimental results is greater than that of pressure which can be explained by the theory of the changing amplitude of ift under a limited range of p t conditions precisely we will carry out more drainage experiments with wider range of multiple p t conditions in the future to verify this inference declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

4710,deep saline aquifer is the preferred reservoir for co2 geological storage however during the primary drainage process of injecting scco2 into deep saline aquifers residual water will form and cannot be drained which will have adverse effects on the capacity and safety of co2 storage this is a new study based on the preliminary exploration 9 groups of scco2 drainage experiments in a natural rock core are carried out under multiple pressure 8 10 and 12 mpa and temperature 40 50 and 60 c conditions to investigate the formation mechanism of residual water during primary drainage process a quantitative power function relationship between residual water saturation and drainage time is proposed a quantitative exponential function relationship between irreducible water saturation and p t conditions is also presented the coefficients a b c and d of two fitting functions are discussed in detail in addition the irreducible water saturation increases with the increase of temperature and decreases with the increase of pressure through deep analysis on the interfacial tension viscosity ratio and logca logm stability phase diagram the interfacial tension of co2 h2o system which determines the capillary entry pressure is regarded as the guiding factor influencing the experimental results rather than the viscosity ratio it is worth mentioning that under the given p t

al 2017 the more residual water in rock pores the less space left for co2 sequestration besides more residual water will also lead to an accumulation of reservoir pressure during co2 injection thus laying a hidden danger for the occurrence of geological disasters li et al 2017 therefore it is necessary to carry out comprehensive and in depth investigations on the formation mechanisms of residual water and the control effects of various factors on the primary drainage process and irreducible water saturation there are many research results on the core scale two phase flow displacement experiment chalbaud et al 2007 proposed that co2 fluid can easily pass through and occupy rock pore channels and spaces when the residual water saturation reaches the minimum suekane et al 2008 measured 24 8 28 2 of the trapped co2 saturation in the core while pentland et al 2011a 2011b measured higher trapped co2 saturations of 35 37 under almost the same experimental conditions through comparative analysis the difference between the three experimental results is caused by different residual water saturations bennion and bachu 2006 measured the variation range of residual water saturation in different rock samples is 20 82 bennion and bachu 2010 and bachu 2013 measured the residual water saturation 21 0 85 2 and trapped co2 saturation 4 5 41 5 in 29 sandstone and carbonate rock samples kitamura et al 2013 measured a very high residual water saturation of 53 7 in sandstone but the corresponding trapped co2 saturation is very low 5 6 therefore higher residual water saturation in rock pores will lead to lower co2 saturation al zaidi et al 2018a al zaidi et al 2018b al zaidi et al 2019 and al zaidi and fan 2019 injected co2 in gas liquid and supercritical state respectively into saturated sandstone under different temperature pressure injection rate and salinity to study their influences on inlet outlet pressure difference and displacement efficiency however they did not conduct long term displacement experiment to obtain irreducible water saturation some preliminary explorations were carried out on the formation mechanisms of residual water during primary drainage process and the control effects of its influencing factors in the study of li et al 2013 effects of brine concentration on the formation of residual water were investigated it is found that the saturation of residual water increases with the increase of brine concentration a qualitative conclusion meanwhile the formation process of residual water is divided into 3 stages they are the pushing drainage portable drainage and dissolved drainage stages li and yu 2014 carried out studies on the effects of brine species on the formation of residual water in brine co2 systems the order of residual water saturation of brine with different cations is cacl2 nacl deionized water a qualitative conclusion based on analysis the difference of experimental results is attributed to various interfacial tensions in brine co2 systems a capillary model was also proposed to interpret the mechanisms that characterize the 3 stages of drainage process moreover the effects of quartz content on the formation of residual water in a brine co2 quartz system was also carried out by li et al 2015 the results show that the irreducible water saturation was lower with higher quartz content in the rock core a qualitative conclusion as the contact angle the wettability in brine co2 mineral system is ever changing based on the above research li et al 2017 proposed a comprehensive review to identify the influence of residual water saturation on co2 sequestration and factors affecting it these factors include co2 brine interfacial tension ift and related factors which can influence ift contact angles in brine co2 rock systems and related factors which can affect contact angles heterogeneity and mineral composition of rocks mass the permeability and porosity of the aquifer two phase equilibrium and co2 injection rate and duration however these factors are inferred qualitatively from lots of two phase displacement experiments and cannot quantitatively reveal the formation mechanisms of residual water as well as the control effects of various influencing factors it is worth mentioning that li and yu 2020 quantitatively reveals the effect mechanism of initial pore water saturation on co2 breakthrough pressure time through numerical simulation it is found that both breakthrough pressure and breakthrough time are exponentially related to the initial water saturation of rock core nevertheless this conclusion is only applicable to the first stage of the primary drainage process that is the pushing drainage stage based on the above preliminary explorations we carry out a new research focusing on the properties of two phase fluid in this study in addition to the concentration and species of brine the key factor that can change the properties of two phase fluid is the p t conditions throughout the experiment p t conditions can change the interfacial tension of co2 h2o system contact angle in co2 h2o mineral system viscosity of two phase fluid and even the fingering type viscosity fingering capillary fingering or stable displacement of displacement 9 groups of drainage experiments under multiple pressures 8 10 and 12 mpa and temperatures 40 50 and 60 c are conducted to investigate p t effects on primary drainage process and residual water two quantitative fitting functions are presented in this study the dominant factor affecting primary drainage process is also identified based on detailed discussions this study can help the actual co2 geo sequestration projects select the optimal target reservoir both temperature and pressure conditions are appropriate or inject fluids into deep underground in the best state with a purpose to reduce residual water and increase co2 storage capacity 2 experimental materials and methods 2 1 rock core the rock core used in this study is a natural rock core extracted from the deep strata triassic yanchang formation with a depth of 949 m shown in fig 1 of ccs project 2 monitoring well in ordos basin which is the second largest sedimentary basin in china and has great potential for large scale co2 geological storage this rock core is a standard cylinder with a length of 30 mm and a diameter of 25 mm fig 2 we can see from fig 2 that this rock core shows general homogeneity and absence of micro fractures based on visual inspection and it maintains its mechanical integrity in order to have a better understanding of this rock core x ray diffraction electron microscopy field emission scanning electron microscopy fe sem and conventional mercury injection tests were carried out for the x ray diffraction its principle is to strike x ray at different positions angles of minerals and set the intensity of the minerals to judge the type and percentage content of minerals according to the peak shape formed the results showed that the content of quartz was 63 1 albite 25 5 ordovicite 8 6 and muscovite 2 8 fig 3 as for fig 3 abscissa represents the angle and ordinate represents the intensity dimensionless the photographs of electron microscopy a and fe sem b are shown in fig 4 microscopically it can be observed that the rocks mainly consist of quartz feldspar and rock fragments or fillings quartz is granular colorless and transparent it is mainly in the form of sub angular it has wavy extinction and a few micro cracks the particle size of quartz is 0 10 0 90 mm it is mainly of coarse and medium grain size and has directional distribution feldspar is slab like mainly in sub angular shape a small number of visible cracks particle size is in the range of 0 25 0 80 mm directional distribution mica is flaky and polychromatic with the flake diameters of 0 05 0 20 mm the amount of rock fragments or fillings is very small some siliceous fragments are classified as quartz according to the national standard the two photos in fig 4 a are the front and reverse photographs of core slices the scale in 200 μm is marked in the lower left corner in order to show the structure of the pore more clearly the fe sem images of the three dimensional structure without polishing are given in fig 4 b the magnification of the fe sem images is much larger than that of the electron microscope images the scale of 2 μm is also given at the lower side according to fe sem images obvious pore channels can be seen based on the conventional mercury injection tests the gas permeability of 8 71 md the porosity of 17 88 and the density of 2 16 g cm3 for the rock core is obtained the maximum pore throat radius is 13 36 μm the average pore throat radius is 3 36 μm and the median pore throat radius is 0 40 μm respectively according to fig 5 the pore throat radius is uniformly distributed in the range of 0 0025 16 00 μm and reaches the maximum pore throat distribution frequency of 9 99 at 6 30 μm the shadow section besides the peak of permeability contribution is 47 13 at 10 00 μm the curve section therefore according to visual observation and various analysis on this rock core it can be inferred that there are no obvious fissures joints and fillings in it which can be approximately considered that the rock core is homogeneous and isotropic 2 2 experimental apparatus and methods the experimental apparatus used in this study is the multi functional physical simulation experimental device under geological storage conditions as shown in figs 6 and 7 the multi functional physical simulation experimental device can simulate the permeation process of gas and liquid fluids in rock media under different temperatures and pressures with the help of the latest achievements of modern science and technology such as computer technology and advanced sensor technology the core flooding experiments are carried out this apparatus also provides technical support for improving co2 storage efficiency and effect and provides data preparation for numerical simulation technology the device consists of the following 6 systems 1 vacuum extraction system 2 gas injection system 3 liquid injection system 4 core holder system 5 confining and back pressure system 6 measurement system for more information please refer to preliminary study of li and yu 2014 in geological storage co2 is stored in a high density super critical state because this high density liquid can make full use of the pore space in aquifer rocks zuo et al 2012 in order to simulate the actual storage conditions the experiments were carried out under 9 different combinations of temperatures and pressures shown in table 1 these p t conditions are all higher than the critical points of 7 38 mpa and 31 1 c suekane et al 2008 for co2 the residual or irreducible water saturation is calculated as 1 s wrr m 2 m 0 m 1 m 0 where swrr is the residual or irreducible water saturation m0 is the dry weight of rock core g m1 is the saturated weight of rock core g m2 is the residual weight of rock core g after co2 displacement of water li et al 2013 2015 2017 li and yu 2014 in the experiments the electronic balance is used to weigh the mass of core samples and the displaced water the reading accuracy reaches the last two decimal points before the first use of the rock core the rock core should be placed in the core holder and washed with deionized water with a high flow rate at high p t conditions to remove the unstable rock particles and open the unstable pore channels until there are no rock particles washed out the specific experimental steps are as follows all operation methods strictly follow the routine methods for core analysis of the oil and gas industry in china professional standard sy t 5336 2006 1 before the start of each drainage experiment the dry weight m0 and the saturated weight m1 of the rock core should be accurately weighed and recorded please refer to li and yu 2014 and li et al 2015 for more details 2 the rock core saturated with deionized water is put into the core holder the temperature of the thermostat is set to 40 50 60 c and the co2 pressure in the gas tank is increased to 10 12 14 mpa 2 mpa greater than the back pressure of the holder so as to ensure that co2 in the gas tank is in super critical state and can easily displace the water deionized water is then injected into the core and the back and circumferential pressure are increased to 8 10 12 mpa and 20 mpa step by step when the pressure at the outlet of the core holder reaches 8 10 12 mpa the water injection is stopped 3 the super critical co2 in the gas tank is then injected into the core holder the injection pressure is controlled by the gas pressurization system the pressure difference between the inlet and outlet of core holder is about 1 mpa because co2 flooding belongs to dynamic flooding the actual injection rate varies before co2 breaks through the gripper and escapes the flow rate of water discharged from the core by co2 is basically constant it takes about 1 h to reach this point which is called the breakthrough point there are also parts of the pipeline between the gas tank and the core holder between the core holder and the back pressure filled with water which accumulates during the water injection process the water in these pipes cannot be displaced completely within the 1st hour and the exact amount of the water is unknown therefore the residual water saturation at the breakthrough point cannot be calculated only according to the mass of the displaced water collected in the gas liquid separator when calculating the residual water saturation at this time point the core can be carefully taken out and its residual weight m2 can be accurately weighed and the residual water saturation at this time can be calculated according to equation 1 note that the core holder needs to be depressurized at a very slow speed before the core is removed so as to avoid the flow of liquid in the pore as much as possible at this time the supercritical co2 in the core will become gaseous and dissipate in the air due to decompression 4 with all the experimental conditions unchanged the residual water saturations at 3 and 6 h were calculated by repeating steps 1 3 the reason why core is also taken out and weighed at the time nodes of 3 and 6 h is that the water in the pipeline has not been completely transferred to the liquid collecting device during this period 5 under the same experimental conditions steps 1 3 were repeated this time the experiment lasted from 0 to 120 h during which the rock core was not taken out and weighed it has been verified by tests that the water in the pipeline of the instrument will be completely removed or dried after about 6 h therefore the mass of all the water displaced is the sum of the mass of the water collected in the gas liquid separator and the mass increment of the silica gel desiccant the quality of these two parts of water is obtained at each time node of 9 12 24 36 48 60 and 120 h at the end of the experiment it is necessary to unload the back pressure to the atmospheric pressure at a very slow speed so that the co2 in the rock core can escape through decompression and avoid the flow of liquid in the rock core to the maximum extent then the core was carefully removed from the core holder and its residual weight at 120 h was weighed when calculating the saturation of residual water the mass of water discharged from the instrument pipeline should be subtracted from the total mass of collected water which can be obtained by comparing the difference between the mass of water discharged from the rock core saturation weight minus residual weight and the mass of water collected weight gain of gas liquid separator plus silica gel desiccant firstly the residual weight at 120 h is calculated and then the residual weight m2 at each time node from 60 to 9 h is deduced step by step in each experiment we did not consider the equilibrium of phase states as 1 the water dissolved in scco2 will be absorbed by silica gel desiccant and finally be considered into the calculation of residual water saturation 2 co2 dissolved in water will be released at the end of the experiment and become gaseous when the core is taken out at an extremely slow speed and then dissipate in the air therefore we can infer that the mass conversion between scco2 and water will not have a great impact on the experimental results moreover before the start of each new experiment the core should be dried and saturated again to accurately weigh its dry weight and saturated weight so as to avoid the error caused by the falling off of rock cuttings and allow us to calculate and verify the porosity and permeability of the core again the verification results show that after repeated use the porosity and permeability of the artificial core do not change li and yu 2014 li et al 2015 therefore in order to avoid experimental errors caused by using different cores we can use only one core throughout the experiments 3 results and discussion 3 1 results take experiment 1 8 mpa 40 c as an example the curve of drainage flow rate with time is shown in fig 8 it can be seen from this curve that the whole primary drainage process can be divided into 3 stages which is exactly consistent with the conclusions of li et al 2013 li and yu 2014 and li et al 2015 that is the pushing drainage portable drainage and dissolved drainage stages the pushing drainage stage starts from the beginning of drainage experiments until the gas is ejected from the outlet in this stage the drainage flow rate is relatively large which can be used to calculate and determine the fingering type showing in fig 13 moreover the water displaced in this stage can fall into the container on the electronic balance and its mass can be measured accurately during the first stage most of the pore water is pushed out of rock pores by scco2 so we have named this stage the pushing drainage stage in experiment 1 this stage lasted about 1 h with an average flow rate of 0 00024 ml s capillary force or hydrophilicity of minerals in drainage process prevent the water from being dried small amounts of water remain on the surface of the rock grains as bound or adsorptive water meanwhile some water is retained as pore angular capillary water between rock grains this part of water can be removed by being entrained in scco2 the water removed in this process were either enveloped or dissolved in scco2 and its amount is small the second step of the curve shown in fig 8 this water would not be collected in the liquid container but is released into the air after the fluids leave the rock core and then was absorbed by the silica gel dryer this stage 0 65 h in experiment 1 is then named as the portable drainage stage however some stable pore angular capillary water between the grains cannot be driven out during the previous two drainage stages in the third stage the residual pore angular capillary water may only be removed by being dissolved in scco2 the solubility of h2o in co2 is very small under p t conditions in this study spycher et al 2003 for all practical purposes we can ignore the negligible amount of water being discharged at this stage that is the dissolved drainage stage lasts throughout the whole drainage process therefore we can set the terminal point of drainage at the end of portable drainage stage the second stage and the residual water saturation at this point can be regarded as the irreducible water saturation this is basically the case in all 9 groups of drainage experiments curves of residual water saturation with drainage time and the results of irreducible water saturation are shown in fig 9 among them fig 9 a shows the results of drainage process under the same pressure of 8 10 and 12 mpa with various temperatures while fig 9 b shows the results under the same temperature of 40 50 and 60 c with various pressures in these drainage experiments water saturations in rock core decrease from 1 immediately during the primary drainage process with the extension of drainage time the decreasing trend of residual water saturation gradually slows down until it remains unchanged the irreducible water saturations for 9 groups of drainage experiments are 0 446 8 mpa 40 c 0 503 8 mpa 50 c 0 578 8 mpa 60 c 0 397 10 mpa 40 c 0 495 10 mpa 50 c 0 549 10 mpa 60 c 0 396 12 mpa 40 c 0 468 12 mpa 50 c and 0 546 12 mpa 60 c respectively fig 10 shows the quantitative relationship between irreducible water saturation and p t conditions the higher the temperature is the higher the residual or irreducible water saturation is the higher the pressure is the lower the residual or irreducible water saturation is 3 2 discussion the variation trend of residual water saturation in all experiments can be fitted as a quantitative power function that is 2 s w a t b where sw refers to the residual water saturation t refers to the drainage time and a b are the fitting coefficients the coefficient of determination r2 is large in all curves which demonstrates that the relationships are all reasonable as the base of power function cannot be 0 therefore the point of time 0 saturation of 1 does not appear in figures based on the analysis of the coefficients a b in these equations it can be seen that when the pressure is constant and the temperature changes fig 9 a the variation of a is very small and irregular it can be considered that a does not change and b decreases with the increase of temperature however when the temperature is constant and the pressure changes fig 9 b a decreases with the increase of pressure and the variation of b is very small and irregular it can be considered that b does not change moreover by comparing figures a and b it can be seen that the influence of temperature on the evolution trend of residual water saturation is greater than that of pressure which can be deduced from the spacing of curves based on fig 10 the quantitative exponential function relationship between the irreducible water saturation and the p t conditions are given as 3 s w c e dx where x refers to temperature or pressure c d are the fitting coefficients r2 is large enough to demonstrates that the relationships are reasonable when x represents the temperature the coefficient d is positive when x represents the pressure the coefficient d is negative through the analysis of fig 10 it can be seen that for x representing the temperature the coefficient c decreases with the increase of pressure while the coefficient d a positive number has no obvious change regularities in addition when x represents the pressure the coefficient c increases with the increase of temperature and the absolute value of coefficient d decreases with the increase of temperature moreover by comparing figures a and b it also can be deduced from the spacing of curves that the influence of temperature on irreducible water saturation is greater than that of pressure 3 2 1 ift effects on experimental results in order to further study the fundamental factors leading to different residual water saturations the interfacial tension ift and the viscosity ratio m of co2 h2o system which are greatly affected by the multiple p t conditions and play a decisive role in the primary drainage process li et al 2017 are investigated according to fig 11 ift decreases with the increase of pressure and increases with the increase of temperature bachu and bennion 2009 in general the irreducible water saturation increases with the increase of ift which can be explained by the laplace equation 4 p c 2 γ b c o 2 cos θ r where pc is the co2 capillary entry pressure γb co2 is the ift between brine and co2 θ is the brine co2 rock contact angle and r is the effective pore throat radius in the porous medium li et al 2017 as the contact angle θ is very complicated there has been no unified law of θ variation with p t conditions on various media particles surface meanwhile cos θ only varies from 0 to 1 which is very small compared with ift it is not necessary for us to take θ as the dominant factor that affecting the drainage process li and yu 2014 li et al 2015 moreover the effective pore throat radius r is constant one rock core we only take ift as the main factor affecting the laplace equation under such p t conditions in this study the higher the ift the higher the capillary entry pressure pc the more difficult for the displacement then the higher the irreducible water saturation in addition based on the fitting formulas it can be found that the influence of temperature variation fig 11 b on the polynomial slope is much greater than that of pressure variation fig 11 a therefore it is confirmed again that the influence of temperature on primary drainage process is greater than that of pressure under p t conditions in this study 3 2 2 viscosity ratio effects on experimental results viscosity ratio which is affected by p t conditions obviously can also be a main factor that influencing the primary drainage process li et al 2017 it is defined as 5 m μ i μ d where m is the viscosity ratio μi is the viscosity of displacing fluid co2 μpa s μd is the viscosity of displaced fluid h2o μpa s basirat et al 2017 based on fig 12 it can be seen that when the temperature is constant the higher the pressure is the greater the two phase viscosity ratio is and the smaller the irreducible water saturation is fig 12 a when the pressure is constant the higher the temperature is the lower the two phase viscosity ratio is and the greater the irreducible water saturation is however experiments of 8 mpa are exceptions with the increase of temperature the viscosity ratio increases and the irreducible water saturation increases fig 12 b moreover according to the fitting polynomial the effect of changing pressures on the polynomial slope fig 12 a is obviously less than that of changing temperatures fig 12 b again it confirms that the influence of temperature on primary drainage process is greater than that of pressure under p t conditions in this study note that the viscosities of two phase fluids are based on the data given by the website of https webbook nist gov chemistry fluid 3 2 3 establishment of logca logm stability phase diagram based on the above discussion we can see that both the interfacial tension and the viscosity ratio of co2 h2o system have important influences on primary drainage process moreover as the effects of viscosity ratio on irreducible water saturation has an exception of experiments under 8 mpa we use logca logm stability phase diagram to further analyze the dominant factor affecting the primary drainage process ca is the capillary number which can be defined as 6 c a μ i v γ b c o 2 where μi is the viscosity of displacing fluid co2 pa s v is the darcy velocity m s γb co2 is the ift between h2o co2 n m 1 note that this equation does not include the effect of wettability i e contact angle θ basirat et al 2017 akhlaghi and hamouda 2014 mapped the displacement regimes on a logca logm stability phase diagram within which 3 flow regimes viscosity fingering capillary fingering and stable displacement are recognized by tuning m and ca fig 13 is the diagram promoted by akhlaghi and hamouda 2014 on the basis of previous study of zhang et al 2011 which took care of errors due to uncertainties and then delimits the boundary this diagram shows that for different values of ca and m i e viscous or capillary dominant flow heterogeneity will affect fluid displacement in different ways it can be seen by mapping points on this diagram that the logca logm values of the 9 experiments all fall in the region of capillary fingering the values of logca are in the range of 6 33 5 39 while the values of logm are in the range of 1 47 1 05 which demonstrates that the capillary force is the guiding force in all 9 drainage experiments in other words the main influencing factors of the 9 groups of drainage experiments can be explained by the laplace equation i e the ift of co2 h2o system rather than the viscosity ratio 3 2 4 control effects of p t conditions on primary drainage processes in combination with the above conclusions the study of brennan 2014 has shown much greater storage efficiencies for deep storage formations with high pressures and temperatures compared to shallow formations this is related to the much stronger influence of pressure on ift and for this reason even if high temperature enhances the ift that influence is compensated by the much greater ift reduction caused by high pressures however in this study the effects of temperature on drainage process or the ift are greater than that of pressure although this conclusion is contrary to the study of brennan 2014 it can be explained by fig 14 li et al 2017 with regard to temperature fig 14 a ift noticeably increases with increasing temperature 40 60 c and this increment gradually reduces with increasing temperature after 60 c while in fig 14 b ift greatly decreases with increasing pressure to some extent definitely before 10 mpa and here after the pressure does not have any significant influence on ift the temperature range in this study is between 40 and 60 c just in the sharp rise stage of a while the pressure is in the range of 8 12 mpa which has tended to the gentle stage of b which confirms that temperature has a greater effect on the experimental results than that of pressure under the p t conditions in this study precisely we will carry out more drainage experiments with wider range of multiple p t conditions in the future to verify this inference 4 conclusions as residual water plays an important role in the storage capacity and safety evaluation of co2 storage in deep underground especially saline aquifers it is necessary to investigate the primary drainage process and the formation mechanisms of residual water under the control of various influencing factors based on previous studies we carried out a new study on 9 groups of drainage experiments under multiple p t conditions to quantitatively study the main factors that affect the drainage process and irreducible water saturation the conclusions are as follows the irreducible water saturations for 9 groups of drainage experiments are 0 446 8 mpa 40 c 0 503 8 mpa 50 c 0 578 8 mpa 60 c 0 397 10 mpa 40 c 0 495 10 mpa 50 c 0 549 10 mpa 60 c 0 396 12 mpa 40 c 0 468 12 mpa 50 c and 0 546 12 mpa 60 c respectively the higher the temperature is the higher the residual or irreducible water saturation is the higher the pressure is the lower the residual or irreducible water saturation is the variation trend of residual water saturation sw with drainage time t in all experiments can be fitted as a quantitative power function that is sw a t b when the temperature changes the variation of a is very small and irregular it can be considered that a does not change and b decreases with the increase of temperature when the pressure changes a decreases with the increase of pressure and the variation of b is very small and irregular it can be considered that b does not change also a quantitative exponential function relationship between the irreducible water saturation and the p t conditions is given as sw c edx when x represents the temperature coefficient d is positive the coefficient c decreases with the increase of pressure while the coefficient d has no obvious change regularities when x represents the pressure coefficient d is negative the coefficient c increases with the increase of temperature and the absolute value of d decreases with the increase of temperature as for the values determination on a b c and d under various p t conditions more experiments are needed through the analysis of interfacial tension and viscosity ratio in co2 h2o systems it can be seen that 1 the higher the ift the higher the capillary entry pressure pc the more difficult for the displacement then the higher the irreducible water saturation 2 the higher the pressure the greater the two phase viscosity ratio and the smaller the irreducible water saturation the higher the temperature the lower the two phase viscosity ratio and the larger the irreducible water saturation nevertheless experiments under 8 mpa are exceptions 3 based on the logca logm stability phase diagram the data points of 9 experiments all fall in the area of capillary fingering the values of logca are in the range of 6 33 5 39 while the values of logm are in the range of 1 47 1 05 which indicates that the capillary force is the dominant factor influencing the two phase flow in this study so the laplace equation should be adopted to clarify the experimental results under the multiple p t conditions in this study the influence of temperature on the experimental results is greater than that of pressure which can be explained by the theory of the changing amplitude of ift under a limited range of p t conditions precisely we will carry out more drainage experiments with wider range of multiple p t conditions in the future to verify this inference declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

4711,the flow processes in unconfined double porosity aquifers consisting of a porous matrix and a dense network of fractures are investigated using the equivalent continuum approach the dupuit assumption and a depth integrated formulation we show that unlike in the case of confined double porosity aquifers in the case we investigate the term describing the internal flux between the two equivalent continua is non linear for the case of dewatering processes a system of partial differential equations which involves only four parameters is developed it is demonstrated that for the opposite case of recharging aquifer at least for some cases a much more complicated mathematical description is necessary for the dewatering aquifer case fully explicit analytical solutions for both the variations of water table and discharge to an adjacent water body are developed we verified the accuracy of the solutions for the head by comparison against numerical results keywords dual continuum approach dupuit assumption depth integrated approach fractures porous matrix analytical solutions numerical solutions 1 introduction understanding and simulating flow and transport in porous fractured porous media is of interest in water resources management problems for both the case of karst and crystalline aquifers in environmental engineering issues in the exploitation of geothermal energy and in oil reservoir engineering maréchal et al 2004 samardzioska and popov 2005 bodin et al 2012 gelet et al 2012 because in those media the geometry of the voids in which flow takes place is highly heterogeneous conventional models are not adequate to describe the hydraulic behavior and more sophisticated simulation approaches mainly the discrete fracture or non homogeneous nh approach which models the matrix as a continuum in which fractures are embedded as discrete conduits samardzioska and popov 2005 fillion and noyer 1996 shafabakhsh et al 2019 koohbor et al 2020 and the double or dual porosity dp model which considers the porous matrix and network of fractures as two overlapping and mutually communicating continua barenblatt et al 1960 aifantis 1980 seem to be appropriate the nh approach is more suitable for aquifers in which only few fractures are present chen 1989 whereas in formations in which there is a dense network of fractures it is often impossible to obtain all required data so that the dp model has to be used chen 1989 samardzioska and popov 2005 in the latter dp model macroscopically two porosities two flow velocities and two pressure heads characterize the medium aifantis 1980 chen 1989 samardzioska and popov 2005 sauter et al 2006 for the reason mentioned above the double porosity continuum approach has gained attention because it is most adequate for several practical problems including the simulation of the hydraulic behavior of several aquifers e g meladiotis and moutsopoulos 2002 abbo et al 2003 kaczmaryk and delay 2007 de smedt 2011 shuler et al 2019 while the dp model has been introduced by barenblatt et al 1960 more recent advances in its theory include the extension of the mathematical approach to take into account

moutsopoulos and tsihrintzis 2009 in the papers mentioned above confined dual porosity aquifers have been considered however only few studies are reported in which the dp model has been used to simulate flows in unconfined aquifers kordilla et al 2012 have developed a model for the simulation of the flow behavior in both the unsaturated and the saturated zone in a karst aquifer in southwest germany using the dp model whereas recharge by precipitation has been taken into account by using a complex approach in which the processes in both the unsaturated and the saturated zone have been considered and 21 adjustable parameters were required they obtained a good fit with most of the specific characteristics of the discharge hydrograph of the aquifer for a 11 months period fewer parameters were necessary in the semi analytical solutions proposed by sedghi and zhan 2019 to describe the flow behavior of an unconfined double porosity aquifer in their sophisticated approach they have considered vertical flow components complex boundary conditions and non constant areal recharge however the differential equations they have solved are not presented in their publication furthermore as it will be shown in the next section they have not used the appropriate expressions to describe the internal fluid exchange between the porous matrix and the fractures moutsopoulos et al 2001 have investigated flow processes in fractured geological formations using the dupuit assumption although they have considered aquifers with several families of fractures rather than aquifers in which the flow takes place in a porous matrix and a network of fractures as in this research some elements of their approach will be used herein as presented in section 2 for the case of an aquifer with two families of fractures in which one dimensional flow occurs the system of equations derived by moutsopoulos et al 2001 reads 1a s 1 h 1 t x k 1 h 1 h 1 x κ h min h 1 h 2 1 2 sgn h 1 h 2 h 1 h 2 2 1b s 2 h 2 t x k 2 h 2 h 2 x κ h min h 2 h 1 1 2 sgn h 2 h 1 h 2 h 1 2 where the subscript i 1 2 denotes the family of fractures hi l the water table depth in each family of fractures i s i and k i lt 1 the specific yield and the hydraulic conductivity while κ l 1t 1 is an exchange coefficient h min min h 1 h 2 where min stands for the function which provides the minimum value of a pair of values and sgn is the sign function defined by the relation sgn x x x so that for x 0 sgn x 1 and for x 0 sgn x 1 we want to point out that eq 1a b correspond to a depth integrated formulation of the equations describing the groundwater motion such an approach has also been adopted albeit for confined flow conditions by önder 1998 and ackerer et al 2014 while trottier et al 2014 and kaczmaryk and delay 2007 to name but a few have considered a non depth integrated formulation to simulate the flow behavior in confined double porosity aquifers the aim of this research is to develop a relatively simple dp model for flow in unconfined double porosity aquifers in which flow takes place in a porous matrix and in a dense network of fractures which requires only few parameters as it was pointed out by delay and ackerer 2016 it is advantageous to use simple approaches to describe flow behavior in underground geological formations because relevant data is hard to obtain both analytical and numerical solutions of the model mentioned above are developed and are used to obtain some insight on the flow behavior of unconfined double porosity aquifers the paper is structured as follows in section 2 of the present publication the pdes describing the flow in an unconfined aquifer consisting of a porous matrix and a dense network of fracture are derived it turns out that for certain boundary conditions they have the same structure as the equations presented above eqs 1a b in section 3 the problem of the one dimensional flow in double porosity unconfined aquifers induced by a sudden change of the piezometric head is investigated both an analytical solution valid for small times and a numerical scheme are derived in section 4 the analytical solution is compared with the numerical results and its range of validity is determined the numerical scheme is also used to investigate the large time behavior of the problem investigated herein finally the findings will be summarized in section 5 2 derivation of the governing equations for double porosity unconfined aquifers consisting of a porous matrix and a dense network of fractures in this section we will develop a system of two pdes for the description of the flow behavior in an aquifer in which flow occurs in both the porous matrix and a dense network of fractures and not in several families of fractures as in moutsopoulos et al 2001 in order that this model be relative simple and it requires only a few parameters we will focus on the discharging aquifer case and we will further assume that all hypotheses adopted by moutsopoulos et al 2001 and are presented below are valid h1 the fracture networks of all individual families of fractures are dense enough so that they can be considered to be equivalent continua h2 the dupuit hypothesis which is valid for essentially horizontal flows holds in the water saturated areas therefore the flow conditions are considered to be hydrostatic h3 darcy flow takes place in the saturated zone h4 the pressure in the non saturated zone is atmospheric h5 fluid exchange between the overlapping media takes place under quasi steady state conditions h6 fluid exchange between saturated zones of the two overlapping media is instantaneous h7 the aquifer is sitting on a horizontal impermeable bottom h8 the height of the capillary zone is negligible and it does not influence the flow process in the discharging aquifer case water is extracted from an aquifer either by pumping or due to water discharge to an adjacent stream because the hydraulic conductivity of the fractures is higher than this of the porous matrix the fluid in them reacts faster to external changes than in the porous matrix so that in the discharging case the head drawdown in the fractures is larger than in the porous matrix subsequently fluid exchange between the two overlapping media takes place as water flows from the porous matrix to the fractures network because the water table elevation of the former denoted by hm is higher than the water table elevation of the fractures which is denoted by hf see fig 1 we want to point out that the simulation of the process of fluid exchange between the two media is straightforward in the region z h f where both media the porous matrix and the fractures are saturated with water to simulate the fluid exchange in the region z hf we will assume that the apertures of the fractures are large enough so that gravitational forces are more important than capillary ones so that suction effects associated with the capillary forces are negligible e g bear 1979 su et al 1999 and subsequently atmospheric pressure conditions may prevail in the void space of the fractures see fig 1 in fact because in several aquifers fractures have an apertures width of several millimeters salve et al 2004 kordilla et al 2017 noffz et al 2019 capillary forces might be negligible the bond number su et al 1999 provides a criterion to determine whether the gravity or the capillary forces prevail moreover the occurrence of gravity flows in the unsaturated zone of fractured aquifers has been proven by noffz et al 2019 who conducted analogue fracture experiments therefore as it is depicted in fig 1 atmospheric pressure conditions are likely to occur in the unsaturated zone of a fractures network the conditions described above are more likely to occur in the case that water table is near the ground surface where the pressure is atmospheric in the case that the upper part of the fractures is unsealed so that the air inside the fractures comes into direct contact with the atmospheric air and further in the case of well connected fracture systems in which the air pressure is constant as noted by noffz et al 2019 on the contrary for the recharging aquifer case for which flow is typically induced either by water injection into a well or by the raise of the water level in an adjacent stream an increase of the water head is induced and the water level in the fractures due to their higher conductivity rises faster than the water level in the porous matrix see fig 2 in the unsaturated zone of the matrix i e for z hm see also fig 2 due to the small dimensions of its pores capillary forces typically prevail and due to the suction effects the pressure is not atmospheric a graphical depiction of the conditions described above is provided in fig 2 while an analysis of the processes is presented in bear 1979 furthermore in the discharging aquifer case because velocity values in the unsaturated porous zone are small due to the small values of the hydraulic conductivity of the matrix the travel time in this region is large and the assumption h6 presented above may not hold in several cases therefore for the recharging aquifer case in an unconfined double porosity aquifer consisting of a porous matrix and a fracture network two of the essential conditions for the validity of our approach do not hold namely that the pressure in the void space is atmospheric hypothesis h4 and that the fluid exchange between the saturated zones of the two overlapping continua is quasi instantaneous hypothesis h6 so the mathematical model which is presented in this study is not expected to be valid in this instance of the recharging problem a more complex simulation approach is necessary which should include the description of the unsaturated flow behavior in the porous matrix indeed as noted by mathias et al 2006 and by kordilla et al 2012 who investigated the flow processes in the vadose zone of a geological formation containing both fractures and a porous matrix information is needed on the dependence of the relative hydraulic conductivity of the porous matrix on the pressure head and also on its pore size distribution indices in fact because in the unsaturated porous matrix the pressure head depends on the relative permeability which is turn is related to the water saturation e g kordilla et al 2012 these data are necessary for the computation of the exchange flow rate in the recharging aquifer case such a complicated computational procedure and such a large amount of data might not be necessary in the recharging aquifer case only in the case that h f h m h m where the fluid exchange processes in the unsaturated zone might be negligible in order to obtain a system of pdes describing the flow behavior in a discharging unconfined double porosity aquifer a similar procedure as in moutsopoulos et al 2001 will be adopted which is based on the mass balance of two overlapping mutually communicating control boxes see fig 3 containing either the porous matrix or the network of fractures the two control boxes describe the flow processes in the same point in space and have the same dimensions length δx width w while their length δx is infinitesimally small their width w and their height which is equal to hf for the network of fractures and to hm for the porous matrix are finite this approach is also similar to the method used by bear 1979 to describe the flow behavior in unconfined single porosity aquifers in addition to the hypotheses h1 h8 already presented it will be assumed that one dimensional flow in the x direction occurs as it has already been stated the discharging aquifer case will be considered in which water is extracted from the aquifer either by pumping or due to mass exchange with an adjacent water body in this section it will be assumed that no recharge due to precipitation occurs while the case above will be discussed in section 4 3 thus by considering the mass balance of fluid flowing through the control box containing the fractures see fig 3 we get the following relation 2 δ v f x t v f i n x t v f o u t x t r f where δ v f x t change of the water volume in the control box containing the fractures l3 v f i n x t water volume flowing into the control box situated at x from the adjacent control box situated at x δx l3 v f o u t x t water volume flowing outwards the control box situated at x into the adjacent control box situated at x δx l3 r f x t water exchange volume between the control box containing the fractures and the control box containing the porous matrix situated in the same point x l3 it is advantageous to further consider the following relations 3a δ v f x t s f w δ x h f x t δ t h f x t 3b v f i n x t q f x δ x 2 t δ t 3c v f o u t x t q f x δ x 2 t δ t 3d q f w h f q f 3e q f k f h f x where hf l is the water table elevation in the fractures sf is the specific yield of the continuum composed by the fractures t t is time qf l3t 1 is the water volume moving laterally into or outwards the control volume qf in and qf out respectively δt t is the time step size w l is the aquifer width qf lt 1 is the darcy velocity and kf lt 1 is the bulk hydraulic conductivity of the fractures network for the water exchange volume in eq 2 one can use the following expression 4 r f δ t z 0 z h m y 0 y w x x δ x 2 x x δ x 2 n f r f d x d y d z where n f l 3 is a parameter related to the volumetric density of the fractures number of fractures per unit volume and r f l3t 1 stands for the fluid exchange rate between a single fracture and the surrounding porous matrix for the estimation of rf we will use the semi empirical relation proposed by shoemaker et al 2008 5 r f β h m x z t h f x z t where h f l and h m l is the piezometric head at the point x z in the fracture and the porous matrix respectively while β l2t 1 is the conductance of the matrix in eq 5 above unlike in equation 22 of shoemaker et al 2008 a positive flow rate indicates that exchange flow takes place from the porous matrix into the conduit although shoemaker et al 2008 have mainly considered conduits having a circular cross section while the cross section of fractures is often orthogonal the influence of the shape of the conduit on the fluid transfer can be considered by the choice of the value of the conductance β taking into account that the dupuit assumptions holds and that flow conditions are hydrostatic 6a for 0 z h f h f x z t h f x t 6b for 0 z h m h m x z t h m x t where hf and hm stand for the water depth in the fractures and the porous matrix respectively hf and hm are depicted in figs 1 and 2 the estimation of the fluid exchange rate r f is straightforward in the region 0 z h f where both the porous matrix and the network of fractures are saturated with water this case corresponds to fig 5a on p 11 in shoemaker et al 2008 considering eqs 5 and 6a b one obtains the relation 7a for 0 z h f r f β h m h f however as depicted in fig 1 for z hf the pore space in the fractures is void i e fractures are filled with air as already stated we will assume that in this region the pressure is equal to the atmospheric pressure i e p p atm which corresponds to hypothesis h4 presented in the introduction it is further consistent with the dupuit assumption to put the origin of the vertical coordinate on the bottom of the aquifer and to let patm 0 bear 1972 1979 by this procedure the piezometric head below the water table of the porous matrix and the fractures network becomes equal to the mean water table elevation in the two equivalent continua as presented in fig 1 taking also into account the definition of the piezometric head h p γ z where p is the pressure γ is the specific weight of water and z is the geodetic height vertical coordinate and considering eq 6b eq 5 becomes 7b for h f z h m r f β h m z we want to point out that shoemaker et al 2008 suggest that their approach is also valid in the case that the saturated porous matrix is adjacent to dry conduits see their pp 10 11 and their fig 5c on p 11 in fact in the case that the fractures are dry one has to consider for the computation of the head and of the exchange flow rate that they are filled with air rather than with water an alternative derivation of eqs 7a b based on the approach of reimann et al 2011 is provided in appendix a introducing relations 3a e 4 and 7a b into eq 2 dividing both sides of the resulting equations by w δ x δ t and letting δ x 0 and δ t 0 we obtain 8a s f h f t x k f h f h f x κ h f h m h f 1 2 h m h f 2 by assuming that all fractures have the same conductance we obtain the following relation for the exchange coefficient κ l 1t 1 8b κ n f β the relation above can be easily extended to the case for which the porous matrix fractures interface has non constant values of the conductance β eq 8a can also be written as 8c s f h f t x k f h f h f x κ 2 h m 2 h f 2 by applying the procedure above to the same control volume but to the porous matrix instead to the network of fracture we obtain equivalently 8d s m h m t x k m h m h m x κ h f h m h f 1 2 h m h f 2 the system of eqs 8a d has the same structure as the system of eqs 1 a b derived by moutsopoulos et al 2001 although different schematizations approaches of the pore space of the aquifer have been adopted a derivation of eq 8a by the method used in moutsopoulos et al 2001 is provided in appendix b similarly to the confined aquifer case e g wilson and aifantis 1982 önder 1998 kaczmaryk and delay 2007 ackerer et al 2014 delay et al 2017 we will assume that the first term on the right hand side of eq 8d is negligible because in most aquifers the relation k m k f holds therefore eq 8d can be reduced to 8e s m h m t κ h f h m h f 1 2 h m h f 2 eq 8e can also be written as 8f s m h m t κ 2 h m 2 h f 2 although eqs 1a b are not adequate to describe the hydraulic processes for the recharging case in a double porosity aquifer consisting of a porous matrix and a family of fractures they may still be appropriate for an aquifer containing two families of fractures provided that the fractures apertures are large enough so that the suction effects are negligible and the fluid exchange is instantaneous we want to point out that as in moutsopoulos et al 2001 we have clearly demonstrated that different expressions to simulate the fluid exchange between the fractures and the porous matrix in the lower part of the aquifer z h f than for the upper part z h f are needed see eqs 7a and 7b these facts have not been taken into account by sedghi and zhan 2019 who have also investigated the flow processes in unconfined double porosity aquifers in the aforementioned study in order to describe the fluid exchange between the two equivalent continua solely the expressions proposed in sedghi and zhan 2016 have been considered which have been developed assuming that all the fractures adjacent to the porous matrix are saturated with water an assumption which does not hold for z h f in the discharging aquifer case see fig 1 we think therefore that the approach above used by sedghi and zhan 2019 is adequate only for the case of small fluctuations of the head so that the relation h f h m holds furthermore the fact that the processes which take place for the recharging aquifer case where the pressure in the porous matrix is non atmospheric and the flow exchange between the two equivalent continua is not instantaneous as described in this section have neither be considered nor described by sedghi and zhan 2019 3 an application example one dimensional flow in an unconfined dual porosity aquifer induced by a step change of the head at the origin 3 1 presentation of the problem we investigate the flow in a semi infinite aquifer induced by a sudden change of the head at the origin initially the water depth in both the fractures and the porous matrix is constant and equal to h while flow occurs by a drawdown of the head by δ h at x 0 see fig 4 the case of a constant value of the hydraulic conductivity k f will be considered the problem outlined above addresses the fluid exchange between an aquifer and an adjacent water body situated at x 0 and has been investigated by several researchers for the case of unconfined single porosity aquifers e g guo 1997 lockington 1997 upadhyaya and chauhan 1998 hayek 2019 although the formulation for the case of an aquifer consisting of a porous matrix and a dense network of fractures is adopted see eqs 8a 8e the solutions we have developed are also valid for aquifers in which flow occurs in two families of fractures described by eqs 1a 1b because as already discussed in both cases the hydraulic behavior is described by the same system of pdes the relevant initial conditions ic and boundary conditions bcs can be stated as 9 for t 0 0 x h f h m h 10a for x 0 t 0 h f h δ h 10b for x t 0 h f h the following dimensionless transformations have been applied 11a g t k f t h s f x x h h f h f h h m h m h κ h 2 κ k f λ s m s f ε δ h h the problem defined by eqs 8a and 8e and the ic and bcs eqs 9 10a b can be reduced to 12a h f t x h f h f x κ h f h m h f 1 2 h m h f 2 12b λ h m t κ h f h m h f 1 2 h m h f 2 the equations above are subject to the following ic and bcs 13a for t 0 0 x h f h m 1 13b for x 0 t 0 h f 1 ε 13c for x t 0 h f 1 3 2 analytical solution 3 2 1 presentation of the solution procedure by the regular perturbation method we will use the regular perturbation method bender and orszag 2010 moutsopoulos and tsihrintzis 2005 liu and yeh 2015 to solve eqs 12a b the following perturbation expansion series will be used 14a h f 1 ε h f 1 ε 2 h f 2 o ε 3 14b h m 1 ε h m 1 ε 2 h m 2 o ε 3 where o denotes order of error the series above can be used for small to moderate values of ε in practice for ε 0 5 as it will be demonstrated in the next sub section by introducing the relations above to the non linear pdes eqs 12a 12b the latter will be transformed to a set of linear pdes 3 2 2 first order approximation by introducing eqs 14a 14b into eq 12a 12b and neglecting o ε 2 terms one obtains the following relations 15a h f 1 t 2 h f 1 x 2 κ h m 1 h f 1 15b λ h m 1 t κ h m 1 h f 1 associated with the following ic and bcs 16a c for t 0 h f 1 h m 1 0 for x 0 h f 1 1 for x h f 1 0 because any disturbance propagates faster in the fractures than in the porous matrix one can assume for small times that 17 h f 1 h m 1 so that eq 15a reduces to 18 h f 1 t 2 h f 1 x 2 κ h f 1 by applying the laplace transform with respect to time and solving the resulting ordinary differential equation ode the following expression results 19 h f 1 1 s e x κ s where h f 1 is the laplace transform of h f 1 and s is the laplace transform variable for small times s is large so that one can assume that s κ taking advantage of the expansions 20a a x a 1 x 2 a o a 3 2 20b e x 1 x o x 2 it can be seen that 21 h f 1 1 s e x s κ x 2 s 3 2 e x s o s 5 2 back transforming the relation above into the real space one gets the following expression 22 h f 1 e r f c x 2 t 1 2 κ x 2 π 1 2 t 1 2 e x 2 4 t x e r f c x 2 t where erfc stands for the complementary error function by applying the laplace transform to eq 15b and considering eq 20a b one gets 23 h m 1 κ λ s κ 1 s e x s o s 3 2 by considering again small times so that λ s κ and back transforming into the real space 24 h m 1 κ λ t 1 2 x 2 e r f c x 2 t π 1 2 t 1 2 x e x 2 4 t interestingly enough the small time solution for confined double porosity aquifers presented by moutsopoulos and tsihrintzis 2009 see their eq 9 a b reduces for the case k m 0 to the first order solution developed in this study eqs 14 22 and 24 the excellent match of the two solutions is due to the fact that the first order approximation does not take into account the water table variations one has also to take into account that moutsopoulos and tsihrintzis used the relations t 1 k f h and t 2 k m h to estimate the transmissivities in the fractures and the porous matrix respectively and further that different non dimensionalisation procedures has been used in the two studies namely in moutsopoulos and tsihrintzis 2009 and in the present research the effects of the water table variation will be estimated in the next sub section in which the second order term will be computed as already stated for small times flow occurs mainly in the fracture space so that in the next section we will compute h f 2 rather than h m 2 nevertheless eq 24 can be used to check the validity of relation 17 and therefore the validity of the analytical solutions presented herein 3 2 3 second order approximation by inserting eq 14a into eq 12a and considering o ε 2 terms one obtains the following pde 25 h f 2 t 2 h f 2 x 2 x h f 1 h f 1 x κ h f 1 h f 1 h m 1 h f 2 h m 2 1 2 h f 1 h m 1 2 subject to the following ic and bcs for t 0 h f 2 0 f o r x 0 h f 2 0 f o r x h f 2 0 26a c in the case that κ 1 eq 25 reduces to 27 h f 2 t 2 h f 2 x 2 x h f 1 h f 1 x by considering eq 22 and applying the similarity transform 28 θ x 2 t one gets the following ode 29 d 2 h f 2 d θ 2 2 θ d h f 2 d θ 4 e 2 θ 2 π 4 θ e θ 2 π erfc θ subject to the bcs for θ 0 and θ h f 2 0 eq 29 can be reduced to a first order ode by putting f h f 2 θ by solving it and integrating one obtains the following expression 30 h f 2 2 e 2 θ 2 2 π θ e θ 2 e r f θ e r f c θ π e r f c θ 2 2 π θ 3 e 1 2 θ 2 2 π where erf stands for the error function erfc has been already defined while e 1 2 is the exponential integral function with the basis n 1 2 defined by the relation e 1 2 x 1 e x t t 1 2 d t wolfram mathematica 7 0 software was used to derive eq 30 the h m 2 term will not be computed because as already stated for small times the changes of the water table elevation in the matrix are small for the case κ 0 the analytical solution reduces to the solution for an unconfined semi infinite single porosity aquifer polubarinova kochina 1962 has developed analytical solutions for the problem above by the regular perturbation series approach however since a different non dimensional approach and different asymptotic expansions have been used and polubarinova kochina has applied the similarity transformation to the original boussinesq equation and not solely to a higher order correction term our solution is not reduced to that of polubarinova kochina for the case that κ 0 we want to further point out that for the problem investigated in this study presented in section 3 and depicted in fig 4 the asymptotic series expansion given by eq 14a and not the procedure adopted by polubarinova kochina 1962 is appropriate we want also to point out that as it is demonstrated in appendix c there is a time span for which both relations 17 i e h f 1 h m 1 and s κ on which the derivation of the analytical solutions is based and also the assumption of quasi steady state for fluid exchange between the two overlapping media i e hypothesis h5 presented in section 2 are valid 3 3 numerical solution we have solved the system of eqs 12a 12b numerically by the du fort frankel method details of the finite difference method fdm scheme which uses an explicit three time level finite difference scheme are presented in upadhyaya and chauhan 1998 moutsopoulos 2013 and shaikh et al 2018 4 discussion and applications 4 1 small time behavior 4 1 1 comparison of the analytical with the numerical solution although the principal use of the analytical solution we have developed is to serve as a verification tool for more general numerical schemes and also to provide some insight on the qualitative behavior of flows in unconfined double porosity aquifers it is of some interest to determine its range of validity the profiles of the water table elevation in the fractures estimated on the basis of the second order analytical solution eqs 14a 22 30 are compared to those obtained on the basis of the fdm numerical scheme presented in section 3 3 values of ε 0 2 and ε 0 3 and of the non dimensional exchange coefficient κ 0 1 and κ 0 2 have been considered for the fdm a grid size of δx 0 005 where δx stands for the distance between grid points and a time step of δt 2 5 10 5 have been used and λ 500 has been assumed the comparison of the analytical to the numerical solution is depicted in figs 5 8 as it is depicted in fig 6 for the case of ε 0 2 and κ 0 2 while for t 1 25 the comparison between the two solutions is satisfactory for larger times t 2 5 discrepancies occur which become larger as time increases on the contrary as depicted in fig 5 for the same time as in the latter case t 2 5 and the same value of ε ε 0 2 but for κ 0 1 a better match occurs than in the case of κ 0 2 similar conclusions for the influence of the non dimensional exchange coefficient κ on the accuracy of the analytical solution we have developed can be drawn for the case of ε 0 3 see figs 7 and 8 again the solution is more accurate for small rather than for large values of the coefficient κ the explanation for the facts presented above is straightforward in order that the first order approximation of the solution eq 22 is valid the condition s κ must hold so that the truncation error in eqs 20a 20b 21 has to be negligible an assumption which holds for small rather than large values of κ furthermore in section 3 2 3 in order to compute the second order o ε 2 approximation of h f the assumption κ 1 has been made some insight on the influence of the values of the non dimensional coefficient ε on the accuracy of the analytical solution can be obtained by comparing fig 5 with fig 7 and fig 6 with fig 8 therefore it can be concluded that for the same time and the same values of κ the analytical solution is closer to the numerical solution which is considered to be accurate for small rather than large values of ε this fact can be explained because o ε 3 terms were truncated in order to estimate the analytical solution see eq 14 4 1 2 discharge to a water body for early times the computation of the discharge from an aquifer to an adjacent stream can be useful for estimation of baseflow and computation of aquifers characteristics for the problem we consider in this paper depicted in fig 4 the specific discharge or discharge per unit length qs l2t 1 can be estimated by the following relations 31 q s k f h f h f x x 0 k f h δ h h f x x 0 by further introducing the relation 32 q s q s h k f and considering the non dimensionalisation procedure defined by eqs 11a g eq 31 becomes 33 q s 1 ε h f x x 0 by considering further the analytical solution we have developed eqs 14a 22 and 30 we obtain 34 q s ε 1 π t κ t π ε 2 π 3 2 t o ε 3 κ ε 2 κ 2 ε the interpretation of eq 34 is straightforward for small times there is a linear contribution of the exchange term to the discharge this contribution has the same sign as the leading o ε term because water flows from the porous matrix through the fractures to the adjacent water body and as it is suggested by eq 34 it grows with time finally the o ε 2 term stands for the correction due to the non linear terms for small values of ε as ε 0 the non linear o ε 2 term in eq 34 can be neglected for this case by considering further to eq 34 also eqs 11a g and eq 32 one obtains the following expression for the specific discharge in dimensional form 35 q s δ h s f k f h π t κ h k f h t π s f eq 35 suggests that as in the single porosity case the mathematical expression of the flow processes in unconfined double porosity aquifers for small variations of the water table can be reduced to the mathematical expressions of confined ones in this case one can use the following definition of the transmissivity of the fractures namely t 1 k f h l2t 1 flow processes in confined double porosity aquifers have been investigated by moutsopoulos and tsihrintzis 2009 one has to take also into account that their relations for the recharging aquifer can also be used for the discharging case so that a minus sign should be used for qs and that in this study the subscripts 1 and 2 stand for the fractures and the porous matrix respectively and considering further that in section 2 we have assumed that k m 0 so that t m 0 by taking finally also into account that the exchange coefficients used in the two studies are related by the expression κ mt κ m h where κ mt stands for the exchange coefficient in moutsopoulos and tsihrintzis 2009 and κ m for the exchange coefficient used in this paper it follows that eq 18 in moutsopoulos and tsihrintzis 2009 which is valid for small times reduces to eq 35 above for κ 0 the problem reduces to the flow in a single porosity aquifer for this case eq 34 becomes 36 q s π ε ε 2 π 3 2 t lockington 1997 has proposed an expression for qs in dimensional form his eq 36 for the unconfined semi infinite single porosity aquifer case for the example presented on his p 26 where in our notations kf 20 m d sf 0 27 h 3 m and δh 1 m it occurs that q s 2 0147 t 1 2 m3 d m where t is in days by considering eqs 11a g eqs 32 and 36 developed in this study one obtains q s 2 0299 t 1 2 m3 d m assuming that the relation of lockington is the accurate one it turns out that the error induced by eq 36 is less than 0 8 the case above corresponds to ε 1 3 for smaller values of ε an even better accuracy is achieved we want to point out that eq 36 is easier to use than the expressions of lockington 1997 and that it is a special case of the more general eq 34 which describes the discharge in an unconfined double porosity aquifer 4 2 large time behavior numerical simulations using the fdm method suggest that as in the confined double porosity case i e landereau et al 2001 moutsopoulos and tsihrintzis 2009 in the unconfined double porosity aquifer case for large times the heads converge to an hydraulic equilibrium in which case the exchange coefficient has no impact nevertheless hydraulic equilibrium occurs earlier for double porosity aquifers with larger values of κ than for small ones additionally for times in which equilibrium has not been reached the heads of the medium with the smaller exchange coefficient form an envelope inside of which are situated the heads of the medium with the larger value of κ see figs 9 a 10 a 11 a b in the numerical simulations mentioned above values of ε 0 1 and ε 0 2 of the specific yield ratio λ 1 and λ 2 and of the non dimensional exchange coefficient κ 0 1 and κ 0 2 have been considered hydraulic equilibrium is achieved more slowly in the case of large values of λ than in the case of smaller ones in the former case a larger amount of water is stored in the porous matrix so that more time is necessary to ensure that sufficient amount of fluid will be transferred from the matrix to the fractures network so that hydraulic equilibrium is reached as it can be seen in fig 11c for the case of ε 0 2 λ 2 hydraulic equilibrium is not fully reached for t 55 while for both the cases of ε 0 1 λ 1 and ε 0 2 λ 1 equilibrium was already reached for t 40 see figs 9b and 10b nevertheless by comparing the head profiles for t 20 and for t 40 to those of t 55 the trend described above is visible as time grows the values of h f and h m get closer and the influence of the non dimensional exchange coefficient κ on the water table profiles gets smaller see fig 11a b c in order to ensure that convergence is reached for large times a much smaller time step δt is necessary than for the small times case for example for ε 0 2 λ 1 κ 0 2 and t 40 a time step δ t 3 9 10 7 was chosen 4 3 generalisation of the mathematical description by adopting a similar to that used by bear 1979 and moutsopoulos et al 2001 for the 2d case and taken into account the recharge discharge from to the ground surface one obtains the following system of pdes to describe flow for the discharging aquifer case 37a s f h f t x k f h f h f x y k f h f h f y κ 2 h m 2 h f 2 n f 37b s m h m t x k m h m h m x y k m h m h m y κ 2 h m 2 h f 2 n m in the relations above nf and nm stand for areal recharge discharge in the fracture network and the porous matrix respectively caused by precipitation evapotranspiration or by fluid exchange with adjacent geological layers in the former case recharge caused by precipitation it may be advantageous to use an empirical approach to estimate nf and nm in order to circumvent the difficulties related to the simulation of flow processes in the vadose zone which is both complicated and requires a large amount of data as it has already been pointed out in section 2 alternatively one can use eqs 37a 37b for time periods for which no recharge due to precipitation occurs so that nf nm 0 5 conclusions in the present publication the flow processes in unconfined double porosity aquifers are extensively investigated in section 2 an analysis of the unsaturated flow behavior in porous media and fractures in the pore scale has demonstrated that a in the case of a discharging aquifer by adopting the depth integrated approach this type of flows can be described adequately by a relatively simple system of pdes eqs 8a and 8d these pdes require only 4 parameters and therefore are advantageous to use for practical purposes because as it has been stated by delay and ackerer 2016 it is advantageous to use simulation approaches to describe groundwater processes with only few hydrogeological parameters because it is difficult to determine them b in the case of a recharging aquifer a much more complex simulation approach is required a large amount of data is needed especially to describe the processes in the unsaturated zone to our knowledge it is reported for the first time in the present work that for unconfined double porosity aquifers a fundamentally different approach is needed for the simulation of discharging and recharging aquifers for the problem of a discharging aquifer both an analytical solution see eqs 14a 22 and 30 and a numerical scheme have been developed as it has been demonstrated in section 4 1 1 the aforementioned analytical solutions are valid for small to medium values of the perturbation parameter ε and of the non dimensional exchange coefficient κ up to 0 3 and 0 2 respectively and for short time domains by comparing the analytical solutions to the numerical ones their accuracy of the latter has been partially checked see section 4 an explicit expression for the discharging flow rate has also been developed eq 34 here one can point out that analytical solutions are an excellent tool to check the validity of more general numerical schemes the large time behavior of the problem described in section 3 1 and in fig 4 has been investigated by numerical means in section 4 2 to the best of our knowledge no analytical or numerical solution has been reported in the literature for the unconfined double porosity equations 8a e apart from the ones developed in the present publication declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

useful discussions and moral support ι thank also the editor professor simunek the associate editor dr roubinet and the two anonymous reviewers for their useful comments and time dedicated to the improvement of our manuscript appendix a alternative derivation of the fluid exchange rate between the porous matrix and the fractures based on the approach of reimann et al 2011 in this appendix we provide an alternative derivation of eq 7b which describes the fluid exchange rate between the porous matrix and an unsaturated fracture taking place in h f z h m reimann et al 2011 proposed the following relation for the fluid exchange rate between a porous matrix and a partially saturated conduit see their eq 16 a 1 r f β δ h ex where δ h ex is the head difference between the porous matrix and an unsaturated conduit and β as in shoemaker et al 2008 depends on the perimeter and the length of the conduit and on the leakance ratio for the estimation of the head one has to take into account case 4 of fig 2 in reimann et al 2011 and to consider further that in the dense network of fractures the diameter of a single fracture is usually equal to a few millimeters so that its cross section can be considered to be infinitesimally small in comparison to h f and to h m therefore as it is depicted in fig a 1 in this study one has to consider the following relation in the region h f z h m a 2 δ h ex h m z considering eq a 1 and eq a 2 which are valid in the region h f z h m one recovers eq 7b of the main text the estimation of the fluid exchange rate in the region 0 z h f is straightforward considering that in this region both equivalent media the porous matrix and the fractures are saturated then one can use the same relation as in the confined dp case i e eq 7a it is straightforward to assume that in the above mentioned saturated region the head difference can be expressed by the relation a 3 δ h ex h m h f considering eqs a 1 and a 3 one recovers eq 7a of the main text we want to point out that both shoemaker et al 2008 and reimann et al 2011 in deriving their relations mentioned above took into account the widely used assumption that the exchange flow rate between an aquifer and a conduit river or stream is directly proportional to the difference of the heads of the two systems e g swain and wexler 1996 appendix b alternative derivation of the partial differential equations describing the flow behavior in unconfined dual porosity media based on the approach of moutsopoulos et al 2001 in this appendix we will use the procedure presented in moutsopoulos et al 2001 to provide an alternative derivation of eqs 8a and 8d we will assume that the dual porosity aquifer consists of two networks of fractures both of them are dense enough so that they can be assumed to be equivalent continua one of the two networks consists of fractures with much larger apertures than the other average values of the properties of the network consisting of fractures having a large aperture which will be referred to as f medium are denoted by the subscript f while average values of the network consisting of fractures with a small aperture which will be referred to as m medium are denoted by the subscript m as in the main text we will further assume that 1d flow and a discharging process takes place so that h m h f the derivation of the equations describing the flow behavior in the aquifer is essentially the same as in section 2 except for the internal exchange term r f as in moutsopoulos et al 2001 we will assume that the internal fluid exchange between the two media takes place through a large number of fractures with a number density number of fractures per unit volume nc these fractures were referred as type 2 fractures in moutsopoulos et al 2001 see their figs 1 and 2 where their length was denoted as li j in this paper their length is denoted by lc and it will be assumed that their cross section is cylindrical with a diameter dc l we will assume that the discharge which flows through them can be computed assuming that quasi steady creeping flow conditions take place so that the hagen poiseuille equation holds which can be expressed as b 1 r c π g d c 4 g 128 ν where rc is the flow rate l3t 1 g l1t 2 is the earth acceleration constant g the head gradient and ν l2 t 1 the kinematic viscosity of the fluid for the computation of the head gradient g one has to consider that in the region z h f the downstream edge of the fractures connecting the two equivalent continua lays in the saturated area of the f medium while for z h f it lays in the dry area where it is assumed that the pressure is equal to the atmospheric in both cases i e for z h f and for z h f its upstream edge comes to contact with the saturated area of the m continuum it follows that b 2a for 0 z h f g h m h f l c b 2b and for h f z h m g h m z l c the exchange term can be computed by the relation b 3 r f δ t z 0 z h m y 0 y w x x δ x 2 x x δ x 2 n c r c d x d y d z by considering relations b 1 b 2a b eq b 3 becomes b 4 r f n c d c 4 π g h f h m h f 1 2 h m h f 2 128 l c ν w δ x δ t considering further the mass balance in the f medium inserting relations 3a e and b 4 into eq 2 dividing both sides of the resulting equation by w δ x δ t and letting δ x 0 and δ t 0 we obtain b 5 s f h f t x k f h f h f x κ h f h m h f 1 2 h m h f 2 the equation above has the same structure as eq 8a however one should use for the exchange coefficient instead of eq 8b the following expression b 6 κ π g d c 4 n c 128 ν l c is some cases in which it is necessary to take into account tortuosity effects one should multiply eq b 6 above by a factor ϕ where ϕ 1 it is straightforward to obtain alternative expressions for the exchange coefficient in the case that the type 2 fractures have an orthogonal cross section see moutsopoulos et al 2001 by considering mass balance in the m medium one recovers eq 8d appendix c range of validity of the analytical solution and their relevance to real world conditions in this appendix we determine whether the analytical solution presented in section 3 holds for real world conditions and particularly whether the time necessary to achieve the quasi steady state assumption assumption h5 is small enough so that there is a time span for which one can use the analytical solution developed in section 3 as noted by chen 1989 the quasi steady state assumption means that the intensity of fluid exchange between the porous matrix and the fractures is in direct proportion to the head difference between the two systems the above quasi steady state is reached only in due course kazemi 1969 chen 1989 as presented by de smedt 2011 who studied the hydraulic behavior in an aquifer in madison discrepancies between field data and model results obtained by a dp model which uses the quasi steady approximation occur for times less than 9 min see his fig 3 moreover the results based on the same theoretical approach and field observations in the sandstone aquifer in mavropigi central macedonia greece suggest that the quasi steady state is valid for times larger than 2 min meladiotis and moutsopoulos 2002 see their table 1 the data above provide an estimation of the lower limit of the time span for which the analytical relations developed in the present work hold the maximum time for which the analytical solution presented in section 3 is valid and for which both relation 17 i e h f 1 h m 1 and the relation s κ hold can be estimated by the following equation see eq 11a c 1 t an max h s f t an max k f where t an max is the maximum non dimensional time for which the relations h f 1 h m 1 and κ s and subsequently the analytical solutions derived in this study hold it can be determined either by comparing the analytical solution to a numerical one see section 4 1 1 figs 5 8 or by considering eqs 19 20a b 21 22 and 24 it is evident by considering eq 24 that for small values of κ the matrix head h m 1 grows slower with time so that relation 17 and therefore the analytical solution hold for longer times taking into account the data provided by wilson and aifantis 1982 önder 1998 and kaczmaryk and delay 2007 we have considered the following cases case 1 we assume that an aquifer has the following properties k f 10 5 m s 1 s f 5 10 4 κ 2 5 10 9 m 1 s 1 h 20 m using this information we obtain κ 0 1 t an max 2 5 and considering eq c 1 it follows that tan max 41 7 min case 2 we assume that an aquifer has the following properties k f 10 5 m s 1 s f 5 10 4 κ 2 5 10 11 m 1 s 1 h 20 m using this information we obtain κ 0 001 t an max 500 and considering eq c 1 it follows that tan max 5 79 days therefore there is a time span in which the lower limit is typically equal to a few minutes and the upper limit ranges between approximately half an hour and several days for which the analytical relations developed for h f eqs 14a 22 and 30 and also the specific discharge q s see section 4 1 2 are valid it has also been proven in this appendix that the condition κ 1 introduced in section 3 2 3 is compatible to real world field conditions see cases 1 and 2 described herein 
4711,the flow processes in unconfined double porosity aquifers consisting of a porous matrix and a dense network of fractures are investigated using the equivalent continuum approach the dupuit assumption and a depth integrated formulation we show that unlike in the case of confined double porosity aquifers in the case we investigate the term describing the internal flux between the two equivalent continua is non linear for the case of dewatering processes a system of partial differential equations which involves only four parameters is developed it is demonstrated that for the opposite case of recharging aquifer at least for some cases a much more complicated mathematical description is necessary for the dewatering aquifer case fully explicit analytical solutions for both the variations of water table and discharge to an adjacent water body are developed we verified the accuracy of the solutions for the head by comparison against numerical results keywords dual continuum approach dupuit assumption depth integrated approach fractures porous matrix analytical solutions numerical solutions 1 introduction understanding and simulating flow and transport in porous fractured porous media is of interest in water resources management problems for both the case of karst and crystalline aquifers in environmental engineering issues in the exploitation of geothermal energy and in oil reservoir engineering maréchal et al 2004 samardzioska and popov 2005 bodin et al 2012 gelet et al 2012 because in those media the geometry of the voids in which flow takes place is highly heterogeneous conventional models are not adequate to describe the hydraulic behavior and more sophisticated simulation approaches mainly the discrete fracture or non homogeneous nh approach which models the matrix as a continuum in which fractures are embedded as discrete conduits samardzioska and popov 2005 fillion and noyer 1996 shafabakhsh et al 2019 koohbor et al 2020 and the double or dual porosity dp model which considers the porous matrix and network of fractures as two overlapping and mutually communicating continua barenblatt et al 1960 aifantis 1980 seem to be appropriate the nh approach is more suitable for aquifers in which only few fractures are present chen 1989 whereas in formations in which there is a dense network of fractures it is often impossible to obtain all required data so that the dp model has to be used chen 1989 samardzioska and popov 2005 in the latter dp model macroscopically two porosities two flow velocities and two pressure heads characterize the medium aifantis 1980 chen 1989 samardzioska and popov 2005 sauter et al 2006 for the reason mentioned above the double porosity continuum approach has gained attention because it is most adequate for several practical problems including the simulation of the hydraulic behavior of several aquifers e g meladiotis and moutsopoulos 2002 abbo et al 2003 kaczmaryk and delay 2007 de smedt 2011 shuler et al 2019 while the dp model has been introduced by barenblatt et al 1960 more recent advances in its theory include the extension of the mathematical approach to take into account fracture skin effects moench 1984 estimation of coefficients of the mass transfer process between the fractures and the porous matrix for realistic field conditions warren and root 1963 gerke and van genuchten 1993 landereau et al 2001 ranjbar and hassanzadeh 2011 estimation of the parameters of the model from field data using an inversion procedure kaczmaryk and delay 2007 fahs et al 2014 ackerer et al 2014 sanchez vila et al 2016 delay et al 2017 and simulation of consolidation processes wilson and aifantis 1982 zhang et al 2004 analytical solutions have also been developed önder 1998 moutsopoulos and tsihrintzis 2009 in the papers mentioned above confined dual porosity aquifers have been considered however only few studies are reported in which the dp model has been used to simulate flows in unconfined aquifers kordilla et al 2012 have developed a model for the simulation of the flow behavior in both the unsaturated and the saturated zone in a karst aquifer in southwest germany using the dp model whereas recharge by precipitation has been taken into account by using a complex approach in which the processes in both the unsaturated and the saturated zone have been considered and 21 adjustable parameters were required they obtained a good fit with most of the specific characteristics of the discharge hydrograph of the aquifer for a 11 months period fewer parameters were necessary in the semi analytical solutions proposed by sedghi and zhan 2019 to describe the flow behavior of an unconfined double porosity aquifer in their sophisticated approach they have considered vertical flow components complex boundary conditions and non constant areal recharge however the differential equations they have solved are not presented in their publication furthermore as it will be shown in the next section they have not used the appropriate expressions to describe the internal fluid exchange between the porous matrix and the fractures moutsopoulos et al 2001 have investigated flow processes in fractured geological formations using the dupuit assumption although they have considered aquifers with several families of fractures rather than aquifers in which the flow takes place in a porous matrix and a network of fractures as in this research some elements of their approach will be used herein as presented in section 2 for the case of an aquifer with two families of fractures in which one dimensional flow occurs the system of equations derived by moutsopoulos et al 2001 reads 1a s 1 h 1 t x k 1 h 1 h 1 x κ h min h 1 h 2 1 2 sgn h 1 h 2 h 1 h 2 2 1b s 2 h 2 t x k 2 h 2 h 2 x κ h min h 2 h 1 1 2 sgn h 2 h 1 h 2 h 1 2 where the subscript i 1 2 denotes the family of fractures hi l the water table depth in each family of fractures i s i and k i lt 1 the specific yield and the hydraulic conductivity while κ l 1t 1 is an exchange coefficient h min min h 1 h 2 where min stands for the function which provides the minimum value of a pair of values and sgn is the sign function defined by the relation sgn x x x so that for x 0 sgn x 1 and for x 0 sgn x 1 we want to point out that eq 1a b correspond to a depth integrated formulation of the equations describing the groundwater motion such an approach has also been adopted albeit for confined flow conditions by önder 1998 and ackerer et al 2014 while trottier et al 2014 and kaczmaryk and delay 2007 to name but a few have considered a non depth integrated formulation to simulate the flow behavior in confined double porosity aquifers the aim of this research is to develop a relatively simple dp model for flow in unconfined double porosity aquifers in which flow takes place in a porous matrix and in a dense network of fractures which requires only few parameters as it was pointed out by delay and ackerer 2016 it is advantageous to use simple approaches to describe flow behavior in underground geological formations because relevant data is hard to obtain both analytical and numerical solutions of the model mentioned above are developed and are used to obtain some insight on the flow behavior of unconfined double porosity aquifers the paper is structured as follows in section 2 of the present publication the pdes describing the flow in an unconfined aquifer consisting of a porous matrix and a dense network of fracture are derived it turns out that for certain boundary conditions they have the same structure as the equations presented above eqs 1a b in section 3 the problem of the one dimensional flow in double porosity unconfined aquifers induced by a sudden change of the piezometric head is investigated both an analytical solution valid for small times and a numerical scheme are derived in section 4 the analytical solution is compared with the numerical results and its range of validity is determined the numerical scheme is also used to investigate the large time behavior of the problem investigated herein finally the findings will be summarized in section 5 2 derivation of the governing equations for double porosity unconfined aquifers consisting of a porous matrix and a dense network of fractures in this section we will develop a system of two pdes for the description of the flow behavior in an aquifer in which flow occurs in both the porous matrix and a dense network of fractures and not in several families of fractures as in moutsopoulos et al 2001 in order that this model be relative simple and it requires only a few parameters we will focus on the discharging aquifer case and we will further assume that all hypotheses adopted by moutsopoulos et al 2001 and are presented below are valid h1 the fracture networks of all individual families of fractures are dense enough so that they can be considered to be equivalent continua h2 the dupuit hypothesis which is valid for essentially horizontal flows holds in the water saturated areas therefore the flow conditions are considered to be hydrostatic h3 darcy flow takes place in the saturated zone h4 the pressure in the non saturated zone is atmospheric h5 fluid exchange between the overlapping media takes place under quasi steady state conditions h6 fluid exchange between saturated zones of the two overlapping media is instantaneous h7 the aquifer is sitting on a horizontal impermeable bottom h8 the height of the capillary zone is negligible and it does not influence the flow process in the discharging aquifer case water is extracted from an aquifer either by pumping or due to water discharge to an adjacent stream because the hydraulic conductivity of the fractures is higher than this of the porous matrix the fluid in them reacts faster to external changes than in the porous matrix so that in the discharging case the head drawdown in the fractures is larger than in the porous matrix subsequently fluid exchange between the two overlapping media takes place as water flows from the porous matrix to the fractures network because the water table elevation of the former denoted by hm is higher than the water table elevation of the fractures which is denoted by hf see fig 1 we want to point out that the simulation of the process of fluid exchange between the two media is straightforward in the region z h f where both media the porous matrix and the fractures are saturated with water to simulate the fluid exchange in the region z hf we will assume that the apertures of the fractures are large enough so that gravitational forces are more important than capillary ones so that suction effects associated with the capillary forces are negligible e g bear 1979 su et al 1999 and subsequently atmospheric pressure conditions may prevail in the void space of the fractures see fig 1 in fact because in several aquifers fractures have an apertures width of several millimeters salve et al 2004 kordilla et al 2017 noffz et al 2019 capillary forces might be negligible the bond number su et al 1999 provides a criterion to determine whether the gravity or the capillary forces prevail moreover the occurrence of gravity flows in the unsaturated zone of fractured aquifers has been proven by noffz et al 2019 who conducted analogue fracture experiments therefore as it is depicted in fig 1 atmospheric pressure conditions are likely to occur in the unsaturated zone of a fractures network the conditions described above are more likely to occur in the case that water table is near the ground surface where the pressure is atmospheric in the case that the upper part of the fractures is unsealed so that the air inside the fractures comes into direct contact with the atmospheric air and further in the case of well connected fracture systems in which the air pressure is constant as noted by noffz et al 2019 on the contrary for the recharging aquifer case for which flow is typically induced either by water injection into a well or by the raise of the water level in an adjacent stream an increase of the water head is induced and the water level in the fractures due to their higher conductivity rises faster than the water level in the porous matrix see fig 2 in the unsaturated zone of the matrix i e for z hm see also fig 2 due to the small dimensions of its pores capillary forces typically prevail and due to the suction effects the pressure is not atmospheric a graphical depiction of the conditions described above is provided in fig 2 while an analysis of the processes is presented in bear 1979 furthermore in the discharging aquifer case because velocity values in the unsaturated porous zone are small due to the small values of the hydraulic conductivity of the matrix the travel time in this region is large and the assumption h6 presented above may not hold in several cases therefore for the recharging aquifer case in an unconfined double porosity aquifer consisting of a porous matrix and a fracture network two of the essential conditions for the validity of our approach do not hold namely that the pressure in the void space is atmospheric hypothesis h4 and that the fluid exchange between the saturated zones of the two overlapping continua is quasi instantaneous hypothesis h6 so the mathematical model which is presented in this study is not expected to be valid in this instance of the recharging problem a more complex simulation approach is necessary which should include the description of the unsaturated flow behavior in the porous matrix indeed as noted by mathias et al 2006 and by kordilla et al 2012 who investigated the flow processes in the vadose zone of a geological formation containing both fractures and a porous matrix information is needed on the dependence of the relative hydraulic conductivity of the porous matrix on the pressure head and also on its pore size distribution indices in fact because in the unsaturated porous matrix the pressure head depends on the relative permeability which is turn is related to the water saturation e g kordilla et al 2012 these data are necessary for the computation of the exchange flow rate in the recharging aquifer case such a complicated computational procedure and such a large amount of data might not be necessary in the recharging aquifer case only in the case that h f h m h m where the fluid exchange processes in the unsaturated zone might be negligible in order to obtain a system of pdes describing the flow behavior in a discharging unconfined double porosity aquifer a similar procedure as in moutsopoulos et al 2001 will be adopted which is based on the mass balance of two overlapping mutually communicating control boxes see fig 3 containing either the porous matrix or the network of fractures the two control boxes describe the flow processes in the same point in space and have the same dimensions length δx width w while their length δx is infinitesimally small their width w and their height which is equal to hf for the network of fractures and to hm for the porous matrix are finite this approach is also similar to the method used by bear 1979 to describe the flow behavior in unconfined single porosity aquifers in addition to the hypotheses h1 h8 already presented it will be assumed that one dimensional flow in the x direction occurs as it has already been stated the discharging aquifer case will be considered in which water is extracted from the aquifer either by pumping or due to mass exchange with an adjacent water body in this section it will be assumed that no recharge due to precipitation occurs while the case above will be discussed in section 4 3 thus by considering the mass balance of fluid flowing through the control box containing the fractures see fig 3 we get the following relation 2 δ v f x t v f i n x t v f o u t x t r f where δ v f x t change of the water volume in the control box containing the fractures l3 v f i n x t water volume flowing into the control box situated at x from the adjacent control box situated at x δx l3 v f o u t x t water volume flowing outwards the control box situated at x into the adjacent control box situated at x δx l3 r f x t water exchange volume between the control box containing the fractures and the control box containing the porous matrix situated in the same point x l3 it is advantageous to further consider the following relations 3a δ v f x t s f w δ x h f x t δ t h f x t 3b v f i n x t q f x δ x 2 t δ t 3c v f o u t x t q f x δ x 2 t δ t 3d q f w h f q f 3e q f k f h f x where hf l is the water table elevation in the fractures sf is the specific yield of the continuum composed by the fractures t t is time qf l3t 1 is the water volume moving laterally into or outwards the control volume qf in and qf out respectively δt t is the time step size w l is the aquifer width qf lt 1 is the darcy velocity and kf lt 1 is the bulk hydraulic conductivity of the fractures network for the water exchange volume in eq 2 one can use the following expression 4 r f δ t z 0 z h m y 0 y w x x δ x 2 x x δ x 2 n f r f d x d y d z where n f l 3 is a parameter related to the volumetric density of the fractures number of fractures per unit volume and r f l3t 1 stands for the fluid exchange rate between a single fracture and the surrounding porous matrix for the estimation of rf we will use the semi empirical relation proposed by shoemaker et al 2008 5 r f β h m x z t h f x z t where h f l and h m l is the piezometric head at the point x z in the fracture and the porous matrix respectively while β l2t 1 is the conductance of the matrix in eq 5 above unlike in equation 22 of shoemaker et al 2008 a positive flow rate indicates that exchange flow takes place from the porous matrix into the conduit although shoemaker et al 2008 have mainly considered conduits having a circular cross section while the cross section of fractures is often orthogonal the influence of the shape of the conduit on the fluid transfer can be considered by the choice of the value of the conductance β taking into account that the dupuit assumptions holds and that flow conditions are hydrostatic 6a for 0 z h f h f x z t h f x t 6b for 0 z h m h m x z t h m x t where hf and hm stand for the water depth in the fractures and the porous matrix respectively hf and hm are depicted in figs 1 and 2 the estimation of the fluid exchange rate r f is straightforward in the region 0 z h f where both the porous matrix and the network of fractures are saturated with water this case corresponds to fig 5a on p 11 in shoemaker et al 2008 considering eqs 5 and 6a b one obtains the relation 7a for 0 z h f r f β h m h f however as depicted in fig 1 for z hf the pore space in the fractures is void i e fractures are filled with air as already stated we will assume that in this region the pressure is equal to the atmospheric pressure i e p p atm which corresponds to hypothesis h4 presented in the introduction it is further consistent with the dupuit assumption to put the origin of the vertical coordinate on the bottom of the aquifer and to let patm 0 bear 1972 1979 by this procedure the piezometric head below the water table of the porous matrix and the fractures network becomes equal to the mean water table elevation in the two equivalent continua as presented in fig 1 taking also into account the definition of the piezometric head h p γ z where p is the pressure γ is the specific weight of water and z is the geodetic height vertical coordinate and considering eq 6b eq 5 becomes 7b for h f z h m r f β h m z we want to point out that shoemaker et al 2008 suggest that their approach is also valid in the case that the saturated porous matrix is adjacent to dry conduits see their pp 10 11 and their fig 5c on p 11 in fact in the case that the fractures are dry one has to consider for the computation of the head and of the exchange flow rate that they are filled with air rather than with water an alternative derivation of eqs 7a b based on the approach of reimann et al 2011 is provided in appendix a introducing relations 3a e 4 and 7a b into eq 2 dividing both sides of the resulting equations by w δ x δ t and letting δ x 0 and δ t 0 we obtain 8a s f h f t x k f h f h f x κ h f h m h f 1 2 h m h f 2 by assuming that all fractures have the same conductance we obtain the following relation for the exchange coefficient κ l 1t 1 8b κ n f β the relation above can be easily extended to the case for which the porous matrix fractures interface has non constant values of the conductance β eq 8a can also be written as 8c s f h f t x k f h f h f x κ 2 h m 2 h f 2 by applying the procedure above to the same control volume but to the porous matrix instead to the network of fracture we obtain equivalently 8d s m h m t x k m h m h m x κ h f h m h f 1 2 h m h f 2 the system of eqs 8a d has the same structure as the system of eqs 1 a b derived by moutsopoulos et al 2001 although different schematizations approaches of the pore space of the aquifer have been adopted a derivation of eq 8a by the method used in moutsopoulos et al 2001 is provided in appendix b similarly to the confined aquifer case e g wilson and aifantis 1982 önder 1998 kaczmaryk and delay 2007 ackerer et al 2014 delay et al 2017 we will assume that the first term on the right hand side of eq 8d is negligible because in most aquifers the relation k m k f holds therefore eq 8d can be reduced to 8e s m h m t κ h f h m h f 1 2 h m h f 2 eq 8e can also be written as 8f s m h m t κ 2 h m 2 h f 2 although eqs 1a b are not adequate to describe the hydraulic processes for the recharging case in a double porosity aquifer consisting of a porous matrix and a family of fractures they may still be appropriate for an aquifer containing two families of fractures provided that the fractures apertures are large enough so that the suction effects are negligible and the fluid exchange is instantaneous we want to point out that as in moutsopoulos et al 2001 we have clearly demonstrated that different expressions to simulate the fluid exchange between the fractures and the porous matrix in the lower part of the aquifer z h f than for the upper part z h f are needed see eqs 7a and 7b these facts have not been taken into account by sedghi and zhan 2019 who have also investigated the flow processes in unconfined double porosity aquifers in the aforementioned study in order to describe the fluid exchange between the two equivalent continua solely the expressions proposed in sedghi and zhan 2016 have been considered which have been developed assuming that all the fractures adjacent to the porous matrix are saturated with water an assumption which does not hold for z h f in the discharging aquifer case see fig 1 we think therefore that the approach above used by sedghi and zhan 2019 is adequate only for the case of small fluctuations of the head so that the relation h f h m holds furthermore the fact that the processes which take place for the recharging aquifer case where the pressure in the porous matrix is non atmospheric and the flow exchange between the two equivalent continua is not instantaneous as described in this section have neither be considered nor described by sedghi and zhan 2019 3 an application example one dimensional flow in an unconfined dual porosity aquifer induced by a step change of the head at the origin 3 1 presentation of the problem we investigate the flow in a semi infinite aquifer induced by a sudden change of the head at the origin initially the water depth in both the fractures and the porous matrix is constant and equal to h while flow occurs by a drawdown of the head by δ h at x 0 see fig 4 the case of a constant value of the hydraulic conductivity k f will be considered the problem outlined above addresses the fluid exchange between an aquifer and an adjacent water body situated at x 0 and has been investigated by several researchers for the case of unconfined single porosity aquifers e g guo 1997 lockington 1997 upadhyaya and chauhan 1998 hayek 2019 although the formulation for the case of an aquifer consisting of a porous matrix and a dense network of fractures is adopted see eqs 8a 8e the solutions we have developed are also valid for aquifers in which flow occurs in two families of fractures described by eqs 1a 1b because as already discussed in both cases the hydraulic behavior is described by the same system of pdes the relevant initial conditions ic and boundary conditions bcs can be stated as 9 for t 0 0 x h f h m h 10a for x 0 t 0 h f h δ h 10b for x t 0 h f h the following dimensionless transformations have been applied 11a g t k f t h s f x x h h f h f h h m h m h κ h 2 κ k f λ s m s f ε δ h h the problem defined by eqs 8a and 8e and the ic and bcs eqs 9 10a b can be reduced to 12a h f t x h f h f x κ h f h m h f 1 2 h m h f 2 12b λ h m t κ h f h m h f 1 2 h m h f 2 the equations above are subject to the following ic and bcs 13a for t 0 0 x h f h m 1 13b for x 0 t 0 h f 1 ε 13c for x t 0 h f 1 3 2 analytical solution 3 2 1 presentation of the solution procedure by the regular perturbation method we will use the regular perturbation method bender and orszag 2010 moutsopoulos and tsihrintzis 2005 liu and yeh 2015 to solve eqs 12a b the following perturbation expansion series will be used 14a h f 1 ε h f 1 ε 2 h f 2 o ε 3 14b h m 1 ε h m 1 ε 2 h m 2 o ε 3 where o denotes order of error the series above can be used for small to moderate values of ε in practice for ε 0 5 as it will be demonstrated in the next sub section by introducing the relations above to the non linear pdes eqs 12a 12b the latter will be transformed to a set of linear pdes 3 2 2 first order approximation by introducing eqs 14a 14b into eq 12a 12b and neglecting o ε 2 terms one obtains the following relations 15a h f 1 t 2 h f 1 x 2 κ h m 1 h f 1 15b λ h m 1 t κ h m 1 h f 1 associated with the following ic and bcs 16a c for t 0 h f 1 h m 1 0 for x 0 h f 1 1 for x h f 1 0 because any disturbance propagates faster in the fractures than in the porous matrix one can assume for small times that 17 h f 1 h m 1 so that eq 15a reduces to 18 h f 1 t 2 h f 1 x 2 κ h f 1 by applying the laplace transform with respect to time and solving the resulting ordinary differential equation ode the following expression results 19 h f 1 1 s e x κ s where h f 1 is the laplace transform of h f 1 and s is the laplace transform variable for small times s is large so that one can assume that s κ taking advantage of the expansions 20a a x a 1 x 2 a o a 3 2 20b e x 1 x o x 2 it can be seen that 21 h f 1 1 s e x s κ x 2 s 3 2 e x s o s 5 2 back transforming the relation above into the real space one gets the following expression 22 h f 1 e r f c x 2 t 1 2 κ x 2 π 1 2 t 1 2 e x 2 4 t x e r f c x 2 t where erfc stands for the complementary error function by applying the laplace transform to eq 15b and considering eq 20a b one gets 23 h m 1 κ λ s κ 1 s e x s o s 3 2 by considering again small times so that λ s κ and back transforming into the real space 24 h m 1 κ λ t 1 2 x 2 e r f c x 2 t π 1 2 t 1 2 x e x 2 4 t interestingly enough the small time solution for confined double porosity aquifers presented by moutsopoulos and tsihrintzis 2009 see their eq 9 a b reduces for the case k m 0 to the first order solution developed in this study eqs 14 22 and 24 the excellent match of the two solutions is due to the fact that the first order approximation does not take into account the water table variations one has also to take into account that moutsopoulos and tsihrintzis used the relations t 1 k f h and t 2 k m h to estimate the transmissivities in the fractures and the porous matrix respectively and further that different non dimensionalisation procedures has been used in the two studies namely in moutsopoulos and tsihrintzis 2009 and in the present research the effects of the water table variation will be estimated in the next sub section in which the second order term will be computed as already stated for small times flow occurs mainly in the fracture space so that in the next section we will compute h f 2 rather than h m 2 nevertheless eq 24 can be used to check the validity of relation 17 and therefore the validity of the analytical solutions presented herein 3 2 3 second order approximation by inserting eq 14a into eq 12a and considering o ε 2 terms one obtains the following pde 25 h f 2 t 2 h f 2 x 2 x h f 1 h f 1 x κ h f 1 h f 1 h m 1 h f 2 h m 2 1 2 h f 1 h m 1 2 subject to the following ic and bcs for t 0 h f 2 0 f o r x 0 h f 2 0 f o r x h f 2 0 26a c in the case that κ 1 eq 25 reduces to 27 h f 2 t 2 h f 2 x 2 x h f 1 h f 1 x by considering eq 22 and applying the similarity transform 28 θ x 2 t one gets the following ode 29 d 2 h f 2 d θ 2 2 θ d h f 2 d θ 4 e 2 θ 2 π 4 θ e θ 2 π erfc θ subject to the bcs for θ 0 and θ h f 2 0 eq 29 can be reduced to a first order ode by putting f h f 2 θ by solving it and integrating one obtains the following expression 30 h f 2 2 e 2 θ 2 2 π θ e θ 2 e r f θ e r f c θ π e r f c θ 2 2 π θ 3 e 1 2 θ 2 2 π where erf stands for the error function erfc has been already defined while e 1 2 is the exponential integral function with the basis n 1 2 defined by the relation e 1 2 x 1 e x t t 1 2 d t wolfram mathematica 7 0 software was used to derive eq 30 the h m 2 term will not be computed because as already stated for small times the changes of the water table elevation in the matrix are small for the case κ 0 the analytical solution reduces to the solution for an unconfined semi infinite single porosity aquifer polubarinova kochina 1962 has developed analytical solutions for the problem above by the regular perturbation series approach however since a different non dimensional approach and different asymptotic expansions have been used and polubarinova kochina has applied the similarity transformation to the original boussinesq equation and not solely to a higher order correction term our solution is not reduced to that of polubarinova kochina for the case that κ 0 we want to further point out that for the problem investigated in this study presented in section 3 and depicted in fig 4 the asymptotic series expansion given by eq 14a and not the procedure adopted by polubarinova kochina 1962 is appropriate we want also to point out that as it is demonstrated in appendix c there is a time span for which both relations 17 i e h f 1 h m 1 and s κ on which the derivation of the analytical solutions is based and also the assumption of quasi steady state for fluid exchange between the two overlapping media i e hypothesis h5 presented in section 2 are valid 3 3 numerical solution we have solved the system of eqs 12a 12b numerically by the du fort frankel method details of the finite difference method fdm scheme which uses an explicit three time level finite difference scheme are presented in upadhyaya and chauhan 1998 moutsopoulos 2013 and shaikh et al 2018 4 discussion and applications 4 1 small time behavior 4 1 1 comparison of the analytical with the numerical solution although the principal use of the analytical solution we have developed is to serve as a verification tool for more general numerical schemes and also to provide some insight on the qualitative behavior of flows in unconfined double porosity aquifers it is of some interest to determine its range of validity the profiles of the water table elevation in the fractures estimated on the basis of the second order analytical solution eqs 14a 22 30 are compared to those obtained on the basis of the fdm numerical scheme presented in section 3 3 values of ε 0 2 and ε 0 3 and of the non dimensional exchange coefficient κ 0 1 and κ 0 2 have been considered for the fdm a grid size of δx 0 005 where δx stands for the distance between grid points and a time step of δt 2 5 10 5 have been used and λ 500 has been assumed the comparison of the analytical to the numerical solution is depicted in figs 5 8 as it is depicted in fig 6 for the case of ε 0 2 and κ 0 2 while for t 1 25 the comparison between the two solutions is satisfactory for larger times t 2 5 discrepancies occur which become larger as time increases on the contrary as depicted in fig 5 for the same time as in the latter case t 2 5 and the same value of ε ε 0 2 but for κ 0 1 a better match occurs than in the case of κ 0 2 similar conclusions for the influence of the non dimensional exchange coefficient κ on the accuracy of the analytical solution we have developed can be drawn for the case of ε 0 3 see figs 7 and 8 again the solution is more accurate for small rather than for large values of the coefficient κ the explanation for the facts presented above is straightforward in order that the first order approximation of the solution eq 22 is valid the condition s κ must hold so that the truncation error in eqs 20a 20b 21 has to be negligible an assumption which holds for small rather than large values of κ furthermore in section 3 2 3 in order to compute the second order o ε 2 approximation of h f the assumption κ 1 has been made some insight on the influence of the values of the non dimensional coefficient ε on the accuracy of the analytical solution can be obtained by comparing fig 5 with fig 7 and fig 6 with fig 8 therefore it can be concluded that for the same time and the same values of κ the analytical solution is closer to the numerical solution which is considered to be accurate for small rather than large values of ε this fact can be explained because o ε 3 terms were truncated in order to estimate the analytical solution see eq 14 4 1 2 discharge to a water body for early times the computation of the discharge from an aquifer to an adjacent stream can be useful for estimation of baseflow and computation of aquifers characteristics for the problem we consider in this paper depicted in fig 4 the specific discharge or discharge per unit length qs l2t 1 can be estimated by the following relations 31 q s k f h f h f x x 0 k f h δ h h f x x 0 by further introducing the relation 32 q s q s h k f and considering the non dimensionalisation procedure defined by eqs 11a g eq 31 becomes 33 q s 1 ε h f x x 0 by considering further the analytical solution we have developed eqs 14a 22 and 30 we obtain 34 q s ε 1 π t κ t π ε 2 π 3 2 t o ε 3 κ ε 2 κ 2 ε the interpretation of eq 34 is straightforward for small times there is a linear contribution of the exchange term to the discharge this contribution has the same sign as the leading o ε term because water flows from the porous matrix through the fractures to the adjacent water body and as it is suggested by eq 34 it grows with time finally the o ε 2 term stands for the correction due to the non linear terms for small values of ε as ε 0 the non linear o ε 2 term in eq 34 can be neglected for this case by considering further to eq 34 also eqs 11a g and eq 32 one obtains the following expression for the specific discharge in dimensional form 35 q s δ h s f k f h π t κ h k f h t π s f eq 35 suggests that as in the single porosity case the mathematical expression of the flow processes in unconfined double porosity aquifers for small variations of the water table can be reduced to the mathematical expressions of confined ones in this case one can use the following definition of the transmissivity of the fractures namely t 1 k f h l2t 1 flow processes in confined double porosity aquifers have been investigated by moutsopoulos and tsihrintzis 2009 one has to take also into account that their relations for the recharging aquifer can also be used for the discharging case so that a minus sign should be used for qs and that in this study the subscripts 1 and 2 stand for the fractures and the porous matrix respectively and considering further that in section 2 we have assumed that k m 0 so that t m 0 by taking finally also into account that the exchange coefficients used in the two studies are related by the expression κ mt κ m h where κ mt stands for the exchange coefficient in moutsopoulos and tsihrintzis 2009 and κ m for the exchange coefficient used in this paper it follows that eq 18 in moutsopoulos and tsihrintzis 2009 which is valid for small times reduces to eq 35 above for κ 0 the problem reduces to the flow in a single porosity aquifer for this case eq 34 becomes 36 q s π ε ε 2 π 3 2 t lockington 1997 has proposed an expression for qs in dimensional form his eq 36 for the unconfined semi infinite single porosity aquifer case for the example presented on his p 26 where in our notations kf 20 m d sf 0 27 h 3 m and δh 1 m it occurs that q s 2 0147 t 1 2 m3 d m where t is in days by considering eqs 11a g eqs 32 and 36 developed in this study one obtains q s 2 0299 t 1 2 m3 d m assuming that the relation of lockington is the accurate one it turns out that the error induced by eq 36 is less than 0 8 the case above corresponds to ε 1 3 for smaller values of ε an even better accuracy is achieved we want to point out that eq 36 is easier to use than the expressions of lockington 1997 and that it is a special case of the more general eq 34 which describes the discharge in an unconfined double porosity aquifer 4 2 large time behavior numerical simulations using the fdm method suggest that as in the confined double porosity case i e landereau et al 2001 moutsopoulos and tsihrintzis 2009 in the unconfined double porosity aquifer case for large times the heads converge to an hydraulic equilibrium in which case the exchange coefficient has no impact nevertheless hydraulic equilibrium occurs earlier for double porosity aquifers with larger values of κ than for small ones additionally for times in which equilibrium has not been reached the heads of the medium with the smaller exchange coefficient form an envelope inside of which are situated the heads of the medium with the larger value of κ see figs 9 a 10 a 11 a b in the numerical simulations mentioned above values of ε 0 1 and ε 0 2 of the specific yield ratio λ 1 and λ 2 and of the non dimensional exchange coefficient κ 0 1 and κ 0 2 have been considered hydraulic equilibrium is achieved more slowly in the case of large values of λ than in the case of smaller ones in the former case a larger amount of water is stored in the porous matrix so that more time is necessary to ensure that sufficient amount of fluid will be transferred from the matrix to the fractures network so that hydraulic equilibrium is reached as it can be seen in fig 11c for the case of ε 0 2 λ 2 hydraulic equilibrium is not fully reached for t 55 while for both the cases of ε 0 1 λ 1 and ε 0 2 λ 1 equilibrium was already reached for t 40 see figs 9b and 10b nevertheless by comparing the head profiles for t 20 and for t 40 to those of t 55 the trend described above is visible as time grows the values of h f and h m get closer and the influence of the non dimensional exchange coefficient κ on the water table profiles gets smaller see fig 11a b c in order to ensure that convergence is reached for large times a much smaller time step δt is necessary than for the small times case for example for ε 0 2 λ 1 κ 0 2 and t 40 a time step δ t 3 9 10 7 was chosen 4 3 generalisation of the mathematical description by adopting a similar to that used by bear 1979 and moutsopoulos et al 2001 for the 2d case and taken into account the recharge discharge from to the ground surface one obtains the following system of pdes to describe flow for the discharging aquifer case 37a s f h f t x k f h f h f x y k f h f h f y κ 2 h m 2 h f 2 n f 37b s m h m t x k m h m h m x y k m h m h m y κ 2 h m 2 h f 2 n m in the relations above nf and nm stand for areal recharge discharge in the fracture network and the porous matrix respectively caused by precipitation evapotranspiration or by fluid exchange with adjacent geological layers in the former case recharge caused by precipitation it may be advantageous to use an empirical approach to estimate nf and nm in order to circumvent the difficulties related to the simulation of flow processes in the vadose zone which is both complicated and requires a large amount of data as it has already been pointed out in section 2 alternatively one can use eqs 37a 37b for time periods for which no recharge due to precipitation occurs so that nf nm 0 5 conclusions in the present publication the flow processes in unconfined double porosity aquifers are extensively investigated in section 2 an analysis of the unsaturated flow behavior in porous media and fractures in the pore scale has demonstrated that a in the case of a discharging aquifer by adopting the depth integrated approach this type of flows can be described adequately by a relatively simple system of pdes eqs 8a and 8d these pdes require only 4 parameters and therefore are advantageous to use for practical purposes because as it has been stated by delay and ackerer 2016 it is advantageous to use simulation approaches to describe groundwater processes with only few hydrogeological parameters because it is difficult to determine them b in the case of a recharging aquifer a much more complex simulation approach is required a large amount of data is needed especially to describe the processes in the unsaturated zone to our knowledge it is reported for the first time in the present work that for unconfined double porosity aquifers a fundamentally different approach is needed for the simulation of discharging and recharging aquifers for the problem of a discharging aquifer both an analytical solution see eqs 14a 22 and 30 and a numerical scheme have been developed as it has been demonstrated in section 4 1 1 the aforementioned analytical solutions are valid for small to medium values of the perturbation parameter ε and of the non dimensional exchange coefficient κ up to 0 3 and 0 2 respectively and for short time domains by comparing the analytical solutions to the numerical ones their accuracy of the latter has been partially checked see section 4 an explicit expression for the discharging flow rate has also been developed eq 34 here one can point out that analytical solutions are an excellent tool to check the validity of more general numerical schemes the large time behavior of the problem described in section 3 1 and in fig 4 has been investigated by numerical means in section 4 2 to the best of our knowledge no analytical or numerical solution has been reported in the literature for the unconfined double porosity equations 8a e apart from the ones developed in the present publication declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements i would like to thank john n e papaspyros and spyridon rapsomanikis for useful discussions and moral support ι thank also the editor professor simunek the associate editor dr roubinet and the two anonymous reviewers for their useful comments and time dedicated to the improvement of our manuscript appendix a alternative derivation of the fluid exchange rate between the porous matrix and the fractures based on the approach of reimann et al 2011 in this appendix we provide an alternative derivation of eq 7b which describes the fluid exchange rate between the porous matrix and an unsaturated fracture taking place in h f z h m reimann et al 2011 proposed the following relation for the fluid exchange rate between a porous matrix and a partially saturated conduit see their eq 16 a 1 r f β δ h ex where δ h ex is the head difference between the porous matrix and an unsaturated conduit and β as in shoemaker et al 2008 depends on the perimeter and the length of the conduit and on the leakance ratio for the estimation of the head one has to take into account case 4 of fig 2 in reimann et al 2011 and to consider further that in the dense network of fractures the diameter of a single fracture is usually equal to a few millimeters so that its cross section can be considered to be infinitesimally small in comparison to h f and to h m therefore as it is depicted in fig a 1 in this study one has to consider the following relation in the region h f z h m a 2 δ h ex h m z considering eq a 1 and eq a 2 which are valid in the region h f z h m one recovers eq 7b of the main text the estimation of the fluid exchange rate in the region 0 z h f is straightforward considering that in this region both equivalent media the porous matrix and the fractures are saturated then one can use the same relation as in the confined dp case i e eq 7a it is straightforward to assume that in the above mentioned saturated region the head difference can be expressed by the relation a 3 δ h ex h m h f considering eqs a 1 and a 3 one recovers eq 7a of the main text we want to point out that both shoemaker et al 2008 and reimann et al 2011 in deriving their relations mentioned above took into account the widely used assumption that the exchange flow rate between an aquifer and a conduit river or stream is directly proportional to the difference of the heads of the two systems e g swain and wexler 1996 appendix b alternative derivation of the partial differential equations describing the flow behavior in unconfined dual porosity media based on the approach of moutsopoulos et al 2001 in this appendix we will use the procedure presented in moutsopoulos et al 2001 to provide an alternative derivation of eqs 8a and 8d we will assume that the dual porosity aquifer consists of two networks of fractures both of them are dense enough so that they can be assumed to be equivalent continua one of the two networks consists of fractures with much larger apertures than the other average values of the properties of the network consisting of fractures having a large aperture which will be referred to as f medium are denoted by the subscript f while average values of the network consisting of fractures with a small aperture which will be referred to as m medium are denoted by the subscript m as in the main text we will further assume that 1d flow and a discharging process takes place so that h m h f the derivation of the equations describing the flow behavior in the aquifer is essentially the same as in section 2 except for the internal exchange term r f as in moutsopoulos et al 2001 we will assume that the internal fluid exchange between the two media takes place through a large number of fractures with a number density number of fractures per unit volume nc these fractures were referred as type 2 fractures in moutsopoulos et al 2001 see their figs 1 and 2 where their length was denoted as li j in this paper their length is denoted by lc and it will be assumed that their cross section is cylindrical with a diameter dc l we will assume that the discharge which flows through them can be computed assuming that quasi steady creeping flow conditions take place so that the hagen poiseuille equation holds which can be expressed as b 1 r c π g d c 4 g 128 ν where rc is the flow rate l3t 1 g l1t 2 is the earth acceleration constant g the head gradient and ν l2 t 1 the kinematic viscosity of the fluid for the computation of the head gradient g one has to consider that in the region z h f the downstream edge of the fractures connecting the two equivalent continua lays in the saturated area of the f medium while for z h f it lays in the dry area where it is assumed that the pressure is equal to the atmospheric in both cases i e for z h f and for z h f its upstream edge comes to contact with the saturated area of the m continuum it follows that b 2a for 0 z h f g h m h f l c b 2b and for h f z h m g h m z l c the exchange term can be computed by the relation b 3 r f δ t z 0 z h m y 0 y w x x δ x 2 x x δ x 2 n c r c d x d y d z by considering relations b 1 b 2a b eq b 3 becomes b 4 r f n c d c 4 π g h f h m h f 1 2 h m h f 2 128 l c ν w δ x δ t considering further the mass balance in the f medium inserting relations 3a e and b 4 into eq 2 dividing both sides of the resulting equation by w δ x δ t and letting δ x 0 and δ t 0 we obtain b 5 s f h f t x k f h f h f x κ h f h m h f 1 2 h m h f 2 the equation above has the same structure as eq 8a however one should use for the exchange coefficient instead of eq 8b the following expression b 6 κ π g d c 4 n c 128 ν l c is some cases in which it is necessary to take into account tortuosity effects one should multiply eq b 6 above by a factor ϕ where ϕ 1 it is straightforward to obtain alternative expressions for the exchange coefficient in the case that the type 2 fractures have an orthogonal cross section see moutsopoulos et al 2001 by considering mass balance in the m medium one recovers eq 8d appendix c range of validity of the analytical solution and their relevance to real world conditions in this appendix we determine whether the analytical solution presented in section 3 holds for real world conditions and particularly whether the time necessary to achieve the quasi steady state assumption assumption h5 is small enough so that there is a time span for which one can use the analytical solution developed in section 3 as noted by chen 1989 the quasi steady state assumption means that the intensity of fluid exchange between the porous matrix and the fractures is in direct proportion to the head difference between the two systems the above quasi steady state is reached only in due course kazemi 1969 chen 1989 as presented by de smedt 2011 who studied the hydraulic behavior in an aquifer in madison discrepancies between field data and model results obtained by a dp model which uses the quasi steady approximation occur for times less than 9 min see his fig 3 moreover the results based on the same theoretical approach and field observations in the sandstone aquifer in mavropigi central macedonia greece suggest that the quasi steady state is valid for times larger than 2 min meladiotis and moutsopoulos 2002 see their table 1 the data above provide an estimation of the lower limit of the time span for which the analytical relations developed in the present work hold the maximum time for which the analytical solution presented in section 3 is valid and for which both relation 17 i e h f 1 h m 1 and the relation s κ hold can be estimated by the following equation see eq 11a c 1 t an max h s f t an max k f where t an max is the maximum non dimensional time for which the relations h f 1 h m 1 and κ s and subsequently the analytical solutions derived in this study hold it can be determined either by comparing the analytical solution to a numerical one see section 4 1 1 figs 5 8 or by considering eqs 19 20a b 21 22 and 24 it is evident by considering eq 24 that for small values of κ the matrix head h m 1 grows slower with time so that relation 17 and therefore the analytical solution hold for longer times taking into account the data provided by wilson and aifantis 1982 önder 1998 and kaczmaryk and delay 2007 we have considered the following cases case 1 we assume that an aquifer has the following properties k f 10 5 m s 1 s f 5 10 4 κ 2 5 10 9 m 1 s 1 h 20 m using this information we obtain κ 0 1 t an max 2 5 and considering eq c 1 it follows that tan max 41 7 min case 2 we assume that an aquifer has the following properties k f 10 5 m s 1 s f 5 10 4 κ 2 5 10 11 m 1 s 1 h 20 m using this information we obtain κ 0 001 t an max 500 and considering eq c 1 it follows that tan max 5 79 days therefore there is a time span in which the lower limit is typically equal to a few minutes and the upper limit ranges between approximately half an hour and several days for which the analytical relations developed for h f eqs 14a 22 and 30 and also the specific discharge q s see section 4 1 2 are valid it has also been proven in this appendix that the condition κ 1 introduced in section 3 2 3 is compatible to real world field conditions see cases 1

4712,in eastern boreal canada long term perspective in water resources and hydroelectric dam management is currently limited by the lack of long term hydrological records the research for new paleohydrological proxies would help fill this hydrological data gap and provide regional hydroclimatic predictive trajectories in the context of climate change the development of long annually resolved series of earlywood vessel cross sectional area has recently demonstrated a high potential for reconstructing high and low discharges this study analyzes a network of 10 sites scattered around lake duparquet the region covers an area of about 20000 km2 including four river basins characterized by natural and regulated rivers and unflooded control sites the objectives were to assess 1 the spatial coherency in flood rings chronologies among sites and lake duparquet and among hydrological regimes natural regulated and unflooded control and 2 their degree of association with i annually resolved chronologies of earlywood vessel cross sectional area and number ii a reconstruction of the harricana river spring discharge and iii discharge data from eleven hydrometric stations distributed in the study area it was hypothesized that flood rings would be consistent among natural rivers and absent from regulated rivers results showed high spatial coherency among natural rivers with flood rings recording the major floods of the last 250 years flood ring and earlywood vessel chronologies were strongly correlated to both reconstructed and instrumental discharge data on regulated rivers trees were younger than at the other sites and mainly spring floods that occurred prior to dam creation and the few extreme floods after dam creation were recorded by flood rings one hypothesis is that older trees before dam most likely recorded the natural dynamic of the river while younger trees after dam most likely recorded dam management maneuvers and spring flood exceeding dam capacity flood rings and earlywood vessel chronologies provided comparable and complementary hydrological evidence flood rings were easily identified visually allowing fast determination of major flood years whereas developing earlywood vessel chronologies while being more tedious and time consuming allowed capturing a larger spectrum of hydrological conditions keywords fraxinus nigra spring

discharge reily and johnson 1981 schook et al 2016 netsvetov et al 2019 up to now no studies have assessed the impact of discharge regulation on flood rings formation in riparian trees the objectives of this study were twofold first the spatial coherency in flood ring chronologies was assessed among a network of ten sites located along four river basins in northeastern canada mattagami abitibi harricana and upper ottawa rivers and at lake duparquet and under three different hydrological regimes natural regulated and at unflooded control it was hypothesized that the flood ring chronologies among natural river basins will be similar and that they will differ from those originating from regulated rivers especially after the creation of dams second we determined the degree of association between flood ring chronologies and i continuous annually resolved series of earlywood vessel cross sectional area and number ii a reconstruction of the harricana river spring discharge and iii discharge data from eleven hydrometric stations distributed in the study area it was hypothesized that these various datasets will be highly correlated thus illustrating the large scale spatial coherency in the spring flood signal in eastern boreal canada 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the study area encompasses lake duparquet and four major river basins mattagami abitibi harricana and upper ottawa rivers located in northeastern canada fig 1 it roughly covers an area of about 20000 km2 the mattagami abitibi and harricana rivers are flowing north and are major southern tributaries of the james bay in the hudson sea déry et al 2011 while the upper ottawa river is flowing south to the saint lawrence estuary figure 1 lake duparquet 48 28 n 79 16 w is situated in the upstream section of the abitibi river near the continental divide fig 1 the mattagami and abitibi rivers are partially regulated with dams implanted since the 1910s cehq 2019 omnrf 2019 supp table 1 while the harricana and upper ottawa rivers are naturally flowing cehq 2019 omnrf 2019 the regional hydrological regime is dominated primarily by snowmelt and summer precipitation with most of the annual discharge flowing during the spring breakup flood for example the mean discharge of the harricana river in may represents 11 to 30 of the total annual discharge over the period 1915 2020 nolin

preissac lake psl harricana river har and little abitibi lake lal four sites with regulated hydrological regime abitibi lake abl regulated downstream by the iroquois falls dam built in 1914 driftwood

among the regulated river sites the abl dfr and fhl sites are located upstream of the dams while the mgr site is located between two dams in total 929 samples were collected from 470 f nigra trees

cehq 2019 and ontario dam inventories omnrf 2019 were used to characterize each sampling site according to hydrological regimes presence of a dam and its distance to the sampling site increment cores were taken from living trees and stem discs were collected from dead trees with all samples collected as close to the ground level as possible wood samples were prepared and sanded following standard dendrochronological procedures phipps 1985 cook and kairiukstis 1990 prior to visual identification of flood rings the prepared sample wood surfaces were rubbed with white chalk to increase the contrast between earlywood vessels and other cell types st george et al 2002 tardif and conciatori 2006b 2 3 tree ring data each sample was systematically inspected with a dissecting microscope to visually determine the presence of flood ring and their presence was labelled on the core mount prior to visual crossdating flood rings were categorized into two classes in relation to their vessel size vessel density and organization within the earlywood fig 2 this visual identification step was carried out by two observers who each had half of the samples amount a dual numerical code was used with a f1 indicating a weakly defined flood ring noticeable increase in number of earlywood vessels supported with a decrease in earlywood vessel area and a f2 indicating a well defined flood ring as previously described in f nigra tardif et al 2010 kames et al 2016 nolin et al 2021 fig 2 this characterisation of flood rings f1 or f2 was chosen to account for the intensity of flood rings rather than a simple presence absence index given that tree elevation and coring height varied within a site and that anatomical changes in earlywood vessels flood ring were reported to occur solely in the submerged portion of the tree stem during active earlywood formation st george et al 2002 copini et al 2016 adopting a dual numerical code aimed to better capture the flood signal after flood ring identification on each sample was completed visual crossdating was performed using f nigra pointed years developed for lake duparquet tardif and bergeron 1997a kames et al 2016 nolin et al 2021 and the list method phipps 1985 in addition to flood ring identifications annual measurements of tree ring earlywood vessels were performed on a small subset of trees the mean cross sectional lumen area

measurement of mean cross sectional area mva and number n of earlywood vessel in annually resolved tree rings was performed as described in nolin et al 2021 using high resolution scanned images of the tree rings the images were acquired from a nikon ds fi1 camera mounted on a nikon smz1000 stereomicroscope to produce standardized tree ring images format 1600 1200 dpi at 20 magnification earlywood vessels were automatically detected and digitalized using the canny edge algorithm canny 1986 implemented in imagej2x software rueden et al 2017 each earlywood vessel shape was checked and false automatic delimitations e g incomplete earlywood vessel lumen areas at the edge of the cores grouped earlywood vessels tyloses were manually corrected with a graphic tablet after ensuring that each earlywood vessel contour delineation was correct the measurements of annual mva and n were performed using wincell software pro v2018c régent instrument 2018 both mva and n were measured on earlywood vessel areas greater than 3000 μm2 in cross section tardif unpublished data the delimitation between earlywood and latewood has been qualitatively identified as the abrupt decrease in vessel cross sectional area tardif and conciatori 2006b kames et al 2016 series crossdating and measurements were validated with cdendro larsson 2003 and cofecha holmes 1983 prior to series detrending each tree ring series was divided by a cubic smoothing spline function with 50 frequency of response of 60 years cook and kairiukstis 1990 six missing values have been interpolated by the spline filling function of the dplr package to detrend the series bunn 2008 detrended series were then combined into standardized chronologies per river basins and hydrological regimes using a bi weight robust mean when n 1 series to lower the influence of outliers this was the case for the abitibi and the harricana rivers n 2 series all statistical procedures of dendrochronology were conducted with the dplr package bunn 2008 in r environment r core team 2020 2 4 hydrological data daily discharges were downloaded from the water survey of canada the reference hydrometric basin network and the centre d expertise hydrique du québec supp table 2 eleven hydrometric stations were selected on natural rivers not regulated by dams supp table 2 and with a minimum of 24 years of data but not necessarily in a continuous sequence daily discharges were averaged from april 15 to june 30 this period best represented the range of discharge variability during the spring flood season and can be equated with the period of earlywood formation in f nigra nolin et al 2021 only years with less than 10 missing daily values for the period 15 april to 30 june 77 days were considered this arbitrary threshold was chosen to avoid statistical shortcomings in the interpolation of missing values it should be noted that the data for harricana river came from two hydrometric stations in close proximity 4 km and for the same drainage area they have therefore been grouped into a single time series because they overlap with no difference in daily discharge values kames et al 2016 nolin et al 2021 in addition to these hydrometric records the harricana river spring discharge reconstruction from nolin et al 2021 was used for comparison 2 5 statistical analyses the spatial coherency of flood rings among the four river basins and lake duparquet was assessed using four approaches first annual flood ring series were compiled by tree keeping for each year the code that had the maximum intensity between the two radii 0 f1 f2 spearman s rank correlation coefficients were calculated between each flood ring series per tree categorical variable value 0 1 or 2 and the reconstructed harricana river spring discharge continuous variable over the maximum series length n ranging from 113 to 246 years the dispersion of correlation coefficients between sites and between hydrological regimes were compared using box plots legendre and legendre 2012 when flood ring series were compared to the reconstruction of the harricana river spring discharge which is derived from f nigra trees growing on the floodplain of lake duparquet the dispersion of correlation coefficients between sites was compared by geographic distance to lake duparquet second flood ring series per tree were used to calculate for each of the ten sampled sites three flood ring relative frequencies f1 f2 and f12 hereafter flood ring chronologies f1 and f2 can be defined as the annual sum of flood rings for a given year divided by the annual sum of samples for the same year and expressed as the percentage of f1 and f2 rings over the total number of samples in a given year f12 is the sum of f1 f2 chronologies and was used to determine whether or not the f1 and f2 flood ring classes carry different hydrological signal each flood ring chronology f1 f2 f12 was correlated using spearman s rank correlation coefficient i with the reconstructed spring discharge of the harricana river ii with spring discharge records from 11 hydrometric stations iii among river basins iv and among hydrological regimes third and in the same way earlywood vessel chronologies mva and n were correlated using pearson s correlation coefficient i with the reconstructed spring discharge of the harricana river nolin et al 2021 ii with spring discharge records from 11 hydrometric stations iii among river basins and iv and among hydrological regimes at last the periodicities that dominate the variance through time were compared using continuous wavelet transform cwt on the mean standardized earlywood vessel chronologies mva and n from the four river basins cwt were computed on a ω0 6 morlet power spectrum base so the morlet wavelet scale be comparable to the fourrier period torrence and compo 1998 significant peaks in spectra were tested against a white noise background on 1 000 monte carlo iterations torrence and compo 1998 all analyses were conducted using r software r core team 2020 and the packages hmisc harrell 2020 for correlations analyses and biwavelet gouhier et al 2019 for continuous wavelet transformations

duparquet maximum value of 100 and natural rivers maximum value of 93 3 demonstrated a higher proportion of flood rings than for regulated rivers maximum value of 39 2 and unflooded control sites maximum value of 10 0 fig 3 indeed each correlation between flood ring chronologies and the different datasets used in this study were highest for lake duparquet higher in natural rivers than in regulated rivers and centered around zero for the unflooded control sites figs 3 4 tables 2 3 in the spatial structure of correlations associations between each flood ring chronologies and instrumental spring discharge records tended to weaken with increasing distance to lake duparquet and in regulated rivers fig 4 table 3 the lowest number of significant associations being found with the southernmost hydrometric station of kipawa river table 3 flood ring chronology values f12 were compared to the reconstructed spring discharge of the harricana river for the period 1771 2016 fig 3 nolin et al 2021 estimated using the reconstruction mean value 1 5 standard deviation 151 3 m3 s that the most severe spring flood years had occured in 1797 1819 1861 1876 1880 1885 1888 1890 1917 1922 1928 1947 1960 1967 1979 1989 2013 and 2014 fig 3a given the variation in hydrological regimes and the number of sampled trees within each an arbitrary threshold was determined to extract the highest f12 values from each regime these thresholds were respetively f12 75 for lake duparquet f12 50 for natural rivers and f12 10 for regulated rivers fig 3 according to these three thresholds the highest values in the f12 flood ring chronologies corresponded well with the 18 years of highest reconstructed discharge years since 1771 with respectively 16 18 14 18 and 10 18 years captured for lake duparquet natural rivers and regulated rivers in each of the hydrological regimes some years with high f12 values above the pre determined thresholds did not match with the 18 most severe spring floods identified using the reconstructed spring discharge of the harricana river fig 3 and supp table 3 for the most part these years were however very close to the 151 3 m3 s threshold used to estimate the most severe spring floods supp table 3 for lake duparquet the five mismatched f12 years with values 75 1907 1909 1919 1950 and 1956 corresponded to reconstructed discharges between 125 0 and 151 1 m3 s similarly the five f12 year with values 50 for the natural rivers 1808 1826 1908 1919 and 1974 corresponded to reconstructed discharges between 125 7 and 148 8 m3 s for the regulated rivers ten f12 values 10 also corresponded to reconstructed discharge ranging from 116 2 to 151 1 m3 s ten high f12 values in regulated rivers chronology were also not indicated by equivalent high f12 values in natural rivers lake duparquet or in the reconstructed spring discharge of the harricana river fig 3 the f12 chronologies from regulated rivers never reached more than 40 with a marked decreased in f2 flood ring frequency observed after ca 1920 fig 3d looking at the individual regulated sites averaged to produce the regulated flood ring chronologies revealed that both lake sites abl and fhl recorded very little flood rings compared to the two river sites dfr and mgr results not shown these differences in flood ring chronologies f1 f2 f12 were further emphasized by the regulated driftwood river dfr 1852 2016 and mattagami river mgr 1904 2016 being significantly correlated with the reconstructed harricana river spring discharge and not the abitibi lake and frederick house lake abl fhl table 2 before the 1920s the chronologies presented few flood rings and after the 1920s flood rings matched the highest spring discharge years reconstructed for the harricana river in the

river r 0 28 p 0 05 n 92 the highest spring discharge years reconstructed for the harricana river were well captured by mva and n chronologies from lake duparquet and natural rivers each of those chronologies showed 1947 and 1960 as the highest spring discharge magnitude in the last 250 years and the years 1880 1890 1922 1989 2013 and 2014 also shared particularily high values fig 5 correlations of earlywood vessel chronologies among river basins and hydrological regimes table 4 and with hydrometric records table 5 fig 1 were highly significant as with flood ring chronologies associations with earlywood vessel chronologies were found to be highest with lake duparquet higher among natural rivers than for regulated rivers and to weaken with increasing distance from lake duparquet tables 4 5 the lowest correlations were found between the mva and n chronologies from the upper ottawa river and the southernmost hydrometric record of kipawa river both flowing south to the saint lawrence river tables 4 5 compared to the n chronologies the mva chronologies were less associated among river basins and showed a greater number of significant correlations 10 10 vs 4 10 for mva table 4 in the structure of correlations between earlywood vessel chronologies and hydrometric records the opposite was observed the associations between mva and hydrometric records were about twice as high as with n and showed a greater number of significant associations table 5 continuous wavelet transformation allowed to investigate the temporal coherency of the earlywood vessel chronologies from the different hydrological regimes n 1 or n 2 trees to the more robust lake duparquet mva and n chronologies n 43 trees since the mva and n chronologies were significantly correlated with the regional spring discharge records it can be hypothezised that the decomposition of their periodicities may reflects the decomposition of periodicities affecting regional spring discharge three major patterns of significant high variance were observed in the power spectrum of chronologies from natural regimes fig 5 right panels a first pattern of 32 year significant periodicity was persistent in mva and n chronologies from lake duparquet up to 1850 and persisted from 1800 to 1975 in the harricana river chronologies in the upper ottawa river chronologies only the mva showed a significant 32 year periodicity affecting the variance from 1850 to 1950 a second pattern near a 16 year periodicity was more variable over time and between river basins than the 32 year pattern it started around 1850 in lake duparquet and around 1900 in other chronologies from natural rivers a third pattern was the apparition of decadal periodicities of 8 years and less from 1875 and 1900 in chronologies from natural rivers except the upper ottawa river the chronologies from the regulated mattagami river began in 1922 and were not long enough to support the accurate calculation of high periodicities low frequencies however the n chronology showed significant high variance similar to that found in natural rivers chronologies notably around a decadal periodicity in 1940 and around a 32 year periodicity from 1925 to 1980 although outside the cone of influence 4 discussion 4 1 spatial coherency among spring flood proxy from natural rivers in this study results showed that both flood ring chronologies f1 f2 f12 and earlywood tree ring anatomical chronologies mva and n hereafter referred to as spring flood proxies were highly intercorrelated spring flood proxies were strongly correlated to harricana river spring discharge and to instrumental data from eleven hydrometric records distributed across a wide boreal territory above 70 000 km2 spring flood proxies provided synchronous evidence of flooding across the four river basins with most of the major spring floods reconstructed for the harricana river for the last 250 years being recorded by f nigra trees growing along lake duparquet and natural rivers major spring floods were also recorded by f nigra trees from regulated rivers but i in comparison by very few trees and ii more often in the form of weakly defined flood rings the signal strength although appears to decrease with geographical distance to lake duparquet and in regulated rivers the high proportion of individual tree showing significant correlation to the reconstructed harricana river spring discharge among natural and to a lesser extent regulated rivers also support strong spatial coherency these results confirm the hypothesis of a common hydroclimatic variability among the four river basins sampled these results are also in line with studies reporting highly significant associations between mean cross sectional earlywood vessel lumen area mva chronologies from lake duparquet and the instrumental regional spring discharge data tardif et al 2010 kames et al 2016 nolin et al 2021 these results also support the fact that the increase in spring flood frequency and magnitude reported by nolin et al 2021 since the end of the little ice age see their reconstruction of the harricana river spring discharge is regionally coherent the similarities found at low frequencies in earlywood vessel chronologies also support spatial coherency between lake duparquet and natural rivers and point towards a decrease in the periodicities of high spring discharge since at least 1850 the frequency of high spring discharge may have changed from a persistent multi decadal periodicity in the late 19th to early 20th century to a decadal and then interannual periodicity in the late 20th century this result compares well with those of previous studies conducted in lake duparquet tardif bergeron 1997b nolin et al 2021 and hypothesizing a long term increase in the frequency and magnitude of spring flooding since the end of the little ice age 1850 1870 matthews briffa 2005 ideally the cwt analysis would have been conducted on a large number of samples per river basins to extract the strongest possible common signal as it was done with the mva and n chronologies from lake duparquet indeed it is possible that factors related to age or stand dynamics may interfere with the hydroclimatic signal in earlywood vessel chronologies tardif and conciatori 2006b for example the sample from upper ottawa river presented a lot of suppressed years very small annual ring width and its mva chronology was not significantly correlated with that of lake duparquet however the consistency expressed by the mva and n chronologies consisting of 1 to 2 trees per river basin compared to the robust lake duparquet chronologies n 43 still demonstrates a strong common signal at both high and low frequencies it was also demonstrated that five f nigra samples may be sufficient to reconstruct most of the interannual variability of the harricana river spring discharge during the 20th century eps 0 85 rbar 0 20 nolin et al 2021 given the similarities observed in the power spectrum of the sampled rivers it would nevertheless be interesting to conduct this cwt analysis on a larger number of samples and to study their associations with large scale atmospheric circulations in north america and at different periodicities 4 2 comparison of spring flood proxies among natural rivers regulated rivers and unflooded control sites compared to f nigra trees growing along the floodplain of naturally flowing rivers those from regulated rivers and from unflooded sites recorded flood rings less frequently and mainly of the weaker type f1 flood ring chronologies from regulated rivers showed little interannual variability and were also less correlated with hydrometric records spring floods identified by flood rings were most coherent with those of natural rivers prior to dam creation in the 1920 s and for a few extreme floods thereafter e g 1947 1960 some weak flood rings f1 were also recorded on regulated rivers although they have not been recorded on natural rivers and lake duparquet and could be the result of dam management maneuvers furthermore trees were generally younger in floodplain sites located along regulated rivers compared to that along natural rivers and lake duparquet suggesting that the construction of the dams may have had a detrimental effect on the existing ash forests in hydrological system that were regulated dewine and cooper 2007 demonstrated for instance that dam construction threatened the recruitment and the persistence of old growth riparian forests in the upper colorado river historically in ontario most dams were built to raise the water level to the high water mark identified by surveyors using signs on the landscape ontario geological survey 1920 since the dams were built to hold water until the maximum natural flood elevation it is likely that the old riparian forests have been permanently flooded and removed from the landscape the potential to accurately reconstruct the historical variability of today s regulated rivers can therefore be lower due to a lack of ancient trees however the few trees sampled on the regulated rivers did record flood rings and this demonstrates that flood ring can be suitable proxy to retrieve partial historical discharge records from the trees growing in the shoreline of regulated rivers in addition further work is needed to assess sites differences in regulated hydrological systems our results indicated variations in the recording of flood rings by f nigra trees located along lakes regulated by downstream dams single dam system and rivers regulated by both upstream and downstream dams multi dam system it would be interesting to systematically compare flood rings in trees located upstream and downstream of dams and according to their position on the bank relative to the shoreline to determine if the hydrological signal provided by flood ring can be improved by a more targeted sampling strategy differences in height between dams may also have impacted downstream water levels and flood rings differently in the unflooded control sites the trees were as old as at lake duparquet but had little or no flood rings with solely few f1 being observed the maximum value of f12 never reached more than 10 and flood rings were not consistent among samples they also did not match the years for which flooding was observed in other river basins either from the spring flood proxies the reconstruction of the harricana river spring discharge or from the regional hydrometric records this confirms that f nigra trees from flooded and unflooded sites carry different climatic signals mainly because their exposures to water stress and drought are different tardif and bergeron 1997a kames 2009 previous studies in the lake duparquet region showed for example that earlywood vessel chronologies from unflooded non riparian f nigra stands were i not significantly correlated to those developed from flooded riparian stands and ii presented no significant correlations with instrumental spring discharge kames 2009 this is also sustained by ring width chronologies developed by tardif and bergeron 1997a and kames 2009 showing a lack of crossdating between riparian and non riparian f nigra trees the physiological mechanisms of flood ring formation are still poorly understood but it was hypothesized that stem submersion induces the production of ethylene which in turn interacts with other growth regulators thus affecting the formation of earlywood vessels yamamoto et al 1995 st george et al 2002 copini et al 2016 it is therefore unlikely that periods of high humidity runoff rainfall etc in topographically flat upland forests will cause a physiological response similar to that of flooding in riparian forests 4 3 adequacy between spring flood proxies advantages and limitations spring flood proxies developed in this study f1 f2 f12 mva n were shown to provide similar and complementary information on high spring discharge variability at an annual resolution the continuous quantitative measurement of earlywood vessels allowed the extraction of a broader spectrum of hydrological variability compared to the semi quantitative visual identification of flood rings which provided event year chronologies among the flood rings chronologies f1 and f2 in lake duparquet and natural rivers captured very comparable signal but their summation f12 captured a slightly broader spectrum of hydrological conditions associated with high spring discharge this result suggest that it is worth identifying both weak f1 and strong f2 flood ring types it is hypothesized that differences between f1 and f2 in f nigra trees for a given year may be reflecting differences in coring height or tree exposure elevation and topography to flooding in flood years it has been shown that the decrease in earlywood vessel size is maximum at the base of the trees with a gradual decrease along the trunk height st george and nielsen 2002 st george et al 2002 furthermore the timing intensity and duration of spring floods will also impact the ability of riparian f nigra trees to record a flood ring st george et al 2002 had showed for instance that the duration of flooding had a greater influence than the peak flood stage on the size of earlywood vessels in flooded quercus macrocarpa among the anatomical chronologies mva and n showed comparable associations to instrumental and reconstructed spring discharge although we cannot robustly assert this result given the limited number of samples that have been used associations between n chronologies and spring discharge were generally higher between river basins and in regulated rivers than with mva chronologies it could thus be hypothesized that earlywood vessels area and number carry slightly different hydrological signal associated with spring flooding in natural and regulated rivers kames et al 2016 showed that the mva and n chronologies extracted from flooded f nigra trees from lake duparquet were associated with climate at slightly different periods the mva and n chronologies were associated with mean monthly temperatures and total precipitation from april to may and april to june respectively in terms of advantages and limitations the use of the various spring flood proxies f12 mva or n depends on the objectives pursued and the resources available e g number of trees equipment while quick to develop visually derived flood ring chronologies like that of numerous pointer years involve processing a larger number of samples and require conventional dendrochronology equipment tardif and conciatori 2006a therrell and bialecki 2015 meko and therrell 2020 continuous earlywood vessels chronologies require fewer samples but is demanding in image analysis equipment and software as well as extensive analysis time kames et al 2016 nolin et al 2021 relative frequencies provide information on the number of samples affected per year while continuous chronologies provide annual quantitative information tardif and conciatori 2006a however it could be hypothesized that as the number of samples increases the relative frequency of flood rings could approximate the hydrological signal extracted by earlywood vessel chronologies composed of far fewer samples it would thus be possible to use relative frequencies of flood rings as spring discharge predictors in reconstruction models even if conventionally flood ring frequencies has been used to identify past flooding and not for the purpose of quantitative reconstruction st george nielsen 2002 therrell and bialecki 2015 meko and therrell 2020 examples of approaches combining both discrete and continuous flood proxies to reconstruct spring discharge can be found in boucher et al 2011 and in nicault et al 2014 5 conclusion in a context of climate change river regulation and disappearance of old riparian forests the study of spring flood proxies is becoming a necessity in water management and flood risk assessment in northern territories this study demonstrated the strong spatial coherency associated with the use of two spring flood proxies in naturally flowing rivers from eastern boreal canada it also stressed the potential limitation associated with the use of flood rings from trees growing along regulated water bodies flood rings and direct measurement of the earlywood vessels captured high resolution comparable and complementary spring flooding evidence even in regulated rivers partial spring flooding history can be inferred from flood rings prior to dam creation results underline the potential and utility of extending the use of these spring flood proxies in dendrohydrology future work could study flood rings over a larger area by sampling for example one natural river per watershed to monitor historical trends in large scale spring floods and study the potential effects of climate change flood ring methods could be applied to more southern river basins such as saint lawrence river or ottawa river it would then be necessary to study the presence of flood rings in species such as green ash

4712,in eastern boreal canada long term perspective in water resources and hydroelectric dam management is currently limited by the lack of long term hydrological records the research for new paleohydrological proxies would help fill this hydrological data gap and provide regional hydroclimatic predictive trajectories in the context of climate change the development of long annually resolved series of earlywood vessel cross sectional area has recently demonstrated a high potential for reconstructing high and low discharges this study analyzes a network of 10 sites scattered around lake duparquet the region covers an area of about 20000 km2 including four river basins characterized by natural and regulated rivers and unflooded control sites the objectives were to assess 1 the spatial coherency in flood rings chronologies among sites and lake duparquet and among hydrological regimes natural regulated and unflooded control and 2 their degree of association with i annually resolved chronologies of earlywood vessel cross sectional area and number ii a reconstruction of the harricana river spring discharge and iii discharge data from eleven hydrometric stations distributed in the study area it was hypothesized that flood rings would be consistent among natural rivers and absent from regulated rivers results showed high spatial coherency among natural rivers with flood rings recording the major floods of the last 250 years flood ring and earlywood vessel chronologies were strongly correlated to both reconstructed and instrumental discharge data on regulated rivers trees were younger than at the other sites and mainly spring floods that occurred prior to dam creation and the few extreme floods after dam creation were recorded by flood rings one hypothesis is that older trees before dam most likely recorded the natural dynamic of the river while younger trees after dam most likely recorded dam management maneuvers and spring flood exceeding dam capacity flood rings and earlywood vessel chronologies provided comparable and complementary hydrological evidence flood rings were easily identified visually allowing fast determination of major flood years whereas developing earlywood vessel chronologies while being more tedious and time consuming allowed capturing a larger spectrum of hydrological conditions keywords fraxinus nigra spring

increased by 35 zhang et al 2000 bush and lemmen 2019 global warming directly affects seasonal flows in the boreal region because of snow and discharge interactions the most significant changes observed from 1950 were in winter where the combination of changes in temperature and precipitation over snow cover resulted in higher winter discharges vincent et al 2015 mudryk et al 2018 aygün et al 2019 bush and lemmen 2019 episodes of rain on snow or rain in place of snow and mid winter thaws feed winter discharge in the boreal rivers instead of storing water in the snow cover instrumental records of the past century in canada also have shown a reduction in spring discharge and in summer discharge associated with a shorter ice season aygün et al 2019 bush and lemmen 2019 hydrological

data mortsch et al 2015 aygün et al 2019 bush and lemmen 2019 in fact most of the historical hydrometric stations in both northern québec and ontario were installed at the time of the creation of the hydroelectric generating stations which complicate the comparison of hydrological records between the pre and post dam periods supp table 1 it also remains uncertain how the projected climate change will affect the frequency and magnitude of extreme floods and droughts gaur et al 2018 hydrological simulations for northern manitoba ontario and québec estimated the magnitude of the change in the probable maximum flood to be between 1 5 and 21 by 2070 clavet gaumont et al 2017 the estimated 100 year snowpack variations ranged from 9 to 8 with large variations between the southern and northern parts of the provinces similarly the simulations for québec predict earlier spring floods and an increase in winter and mean annual discharge with a strong intensity gradient from south to north guay

nielsen 2000 2003 the use of flood rings in north america could be spatially hindered in areas where electricity generation has resulted in river regulation dam management alters the natural availability of water in terms of mean seasonal levels and frequency of flooding which in turn affect riparian forests stella and bendix 2019 and possibly their use as discharge proxy in regulated rivers correlations between tree ring width chronologies and discharge tend to decrease whereas those with precipitation tend to increase resulting in a decreased effectiveness in reconstructing discharge reily and johnson 1981 schook et al 2016 netsvetov et al 2019 up to now no studies have assessed the impact of discharge regulation on flood rings formation in riparian trees the objectives of this study were twofold first the spatial coherency in flood ring chronologies was assessed among a network of ten sites located along four river basins in northeastern canada mattagami abitibi harricana and upper ottawa rivers and at lake duparquet and under three different hydrological regimes natural regulated and at unflooded control it was hypothesized that the flood ring chronologies among natural river basins will be similar and that they will differ from those originating from regulated rivers especially after the creation of dams second we determined the degree of association between flood ring chronologies and i continuous annually resolved series of earlywood vessel cross sectional area and number ii a reconstruction of the harricana river spring discharge and iii discharge data from eleven hydrometric stations distributed in the study area it was hypothesized that these various datasets will be highly correlated thus illustrating the large scale spatial coherency in the spring flood signal in eastern boreal canada 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the study area encompasses lake duparquet and four major river basins mattagami abitibi harricana and upper ottawa rivers located in northeastern canada fig 1 it roughly covers an area of about 20000 km2 the mattagami abitibi and harricana rivers are flowing north and are major southern tributaries of the james bay in the hudson sea déry et al 2011 while the upper ottawa river is flowing south to the saint lawrence estuary figure 1 lake duparquet 48 28 n 79 16 w is situated in the upstream section of the abitibi river near the continental divide fig 1 the mattagami and abitibi rivers are partially regulated with dams implanted since the 1910s cehq 2019 omnrf 2019 supp table 1 while the harricana and upper ottawa rivers are naturally flowing cehq 2019 omnrf 2019 the regional hydrological regime is dominated primarily by snowmelt and summer precipitation with most of the annual discharge flowing during the spring breakup flood for example the mean discharge of the harricana river in may represents 11 to 30 of the total annual discharge over the period 1915 2020 nolin et al 2021 the study area is part of the northern clay belt of québec and ontario where the soils are dominated by glacio lacustrine deposits that transform into peatlands northward daubois et al 2015

cehq 2019 and ontario dam inventories omnrf 2019 were used to characterize each sampling site according to hydrological regimes presence of a dam and its distance to the sampling site increment cores were taken from living trees and stem discs were collected from dead trees with all samples collected as close to the ground level as possible wood samples were prepared and sanded following standard dendrochronological procedures phipps 1985 cook and kairiukstis 1990 prior to visual identification of flood rings the prepared sample wood surfaces were rubbed with white chalk to increase the contrast between earlywood vessels and other cell types st george et al 2002 tardif and conciatori 2006b 2 3 tree ring data each sample was systematically inspected with a dissecting microscope to visually determine the presence of flood ring and their presence was labelled on the core mount prior to visual crossdating flood rings were categorized into two classes in relation to their vessel size vessel density and organization within the earlywood fig 2 this visual identification step was carried out by two observers who each had half of the samples amount a dual numerical code was used with a f1 indicating a weakly defined flood ring noticeable increase in number of earlywood vessels supported with a decrease in earlywood vessel area and a f2 indicating a well defined flood ring as previously described in f nigra tardif et al 2010 kames et al 2016 nolin et al 2021 fig 2 this characterisation of flood rings f1 or f2 was chosen to account for the intensity of flood rings rather than a simple presence absence index given that tree elevation and coring height varied within a site and that anatomical changes in earlywood vessels flood ring were reported to occur solely in the submerged portion of the tree stem during active earlywood formation st george et al 2002 copini et al 2016 adopting a dual numerical code aimed to better capture the flood signal after flood ring identification on each sample was completed visual crossdating was performed using f nigra pointed years developed for lake duparquet tardif and bergeron 1997a kames et al 2016 nolin et al 2021 and the list method phipps 1985 in addition to flood ring identifications annual measurements of tree ring earlywood vessels were performed on a small subset of trees the mean cross sectional lumen area

measurement of mean cross sectional area mva and number n of earlywood vessel in annually resolved tree rings was performed as described in nolin et al 2021 using high resolution scanned images of the tree rings the images were acquired from a nikon ds fi1 camera mounted on a nikon smz1000 stereomicroscope to produce standardized tree ring images format 1600 1200 dpi at 20 magnification earlywood vessels were automatically detected and digitalized using the canny edge algorithm canny 1986 implemented in imagej2x software rueden et al 2017 each earlywood vessel shape was checked and false automatic delimitations e g incomplete earlywood vessel lumen areas at the edge of the cores grouped earlywood vessels tyloses were manually corrected with a graphic tablet after ensuring that each earlywood vessel contour delineation was correct the measurements of annual mva and n were performed using wincell software pro v2018c régent instrument 2018 both mva and n were measured on earlywood vessel areas greater than 3000 μm2 in cross section tardif unpublished data the delimitation between earlywood and latewood has been qualitatively identified as the abrupt decrease in vessel cross sectional area tardif and conciatori 2006b kames et al 2016 series crossdating and measurements were validated with cdendro larsson 2003 and cofecha holmes 1983 prior to series detrending each tree ring series was divided by a cubic smoothing spline function with 50 frequency of response of 60 years cook and kairiukstis 1990 six missing values have been interpolated by the spline filling function of the dplr package to detrend the series bunn 2008 detrended series were then combined into standardized chronologies per river basins and hydrological regimes using a bi weight robust mean when n 1 series to lower the influence of outliers this was the case for the abitibi and the harricana rivers n 2 series all statistical procedures of dendrochronology were conducted with the dplr package bunn 2008 in r environment r core team 2020 2 4 hydrological data daily discharges were downloaded from the water survey of canada the reference hydrometric basin network and the centre d expertise hydrique du québec supp table 2 eleven hydrometric stations were selected on natural rivers not regulated by dams supp table 2 and with a minimum of 24 years of data but not necessarily in a continuous sequence daily discharges were averaged from april 15 to june 30 this period best represented the range of discharge variability during the spring flood season and can be equated with the period of earlywood formation in f nigra nolin et al 2021 only years with less than 10 missing daily values for the period 15 april to 30 june 77 days were considered this arbitrary threshold was chosen to avoid statistical shortcomings in the interpolation of missing values it should be noted that the data for harricana river came from two hydrometric stations in close proximity 4 km and for the same drainage area they have therefore been grouped into a single time series because they overlap with no difference in daily discharge values kames et al 2016 nolin et al 2021 in addition to these hydrometric records the harricana river spring discharge reconstruction from nolin et al 2021 was used for comparison 2 5 statistical analyses the spatial coherency of flood rings among the four river basins and lake duparquet was assessed using four approaches first annual flood ring series were compiled by tree keeping for each year the code that had the maximum intensity between the two radii 0 f1 f2 spearman s rank correlation coefficients were calculated between each flood ring series per tree categorical variable value 0 1 or 2 and the reconstructed harricana river spring discharge continuous variable over the maximum series length n ranging from 113 to 246 years the dispersion of correlation coefficients between sites and between hydrological regimes were compared using box plots legendre and legendre 2012 when flood ring series were compared to the reconstruction of the harricana river spring discharge which is derived from f nigra trees growing on the floodplain of lake duparquet the dispersion of correlation coefficients between sites was compared by geographic distance to lake duparquet second flood ring series per tree were used to calculate for each of the ten sampled sites three flood ring relative frequencies f1 f2 and f12 hereafter flood ring chronologies f1 and f2 can be defined as the annual sum of flood rings for a given year divided by the annual sum of samples for the same year and expressed as the percentage of f1 and f2 rings over the total number of samples in a given year f12 is the sum of f1 f2 chronologies and was used to determine whether or not the f1 and f2 flood ring classes carry different hydrological signal each flood ring chronology f1 f2 f12 was correlated using spearman s rank correlation coefficient i with the reconstructed spring discharge of the harricana river ii with spring discharge records from 11 hydrometric stations iii among river basins iv and among hydrological regimes third and in the same way earlywood vessel chronologies mva and n were correlated using pearson s correlation coefficient i with the reconstructed spring discharge of the harricana river nolin et al 2021 ii with spring discharge records from 11 hydrometric stations iii among river basins and iv and among hydrological regimes at last the periodicities that dominate the variance through time were compared using continuous wavelet transform cwt on the mean standardized earlywood vessel chronologies mva and n from the four river basins cwt were computed on a ω0 6 morlet power spectrum base so the morlet wavelet scale be comparable to the fourrier period torrence and compo 1998 significant peaks in spectra were tested against a white noise background on 1 000 monte carlo iterations torrence and compo

that trees sampled from the four regulated rivers abl dfr fhl mgr were generally younger than in other hydrological regimes with few trees available before the 1850 s n 4 the f1 and f2 chronologies

ρ 0 03 p 0 606 the f12 chronologies were more strongly correlated to instrumental and reconstruted spring discharge than either the f1 or f2 chronologies table 3 the f12 chronologies for both lake duparquet maximum value of 100 and natural rivers maximum value of 93 3 demonstrated a higher proportion of flood rings than for regulated rivers maximum value of 39 2 and unflooded control sites maximum value of 10 0 fig 3 indeed each correlation between flood ring chronologies and the different datasets used in this study were highest for lake duparquet higher in natural rivers than in regulated rivers and centered around zero for the unflooded control sites figs 3 4 tables 2 3 in the spatial structure of correlations associations between each flood ring chronologies and instrumental spring discharge records tended to weaken with increasing distance to lake duparquet and in regulated rivers fig 4 table 3 the lowest number of significant associations being found with the southernmost hydrometric station of kipawa river table 3 flood ring chronology values f12 were compared to the reconstructed spring discharge of the harricana river for the period 1771 2016 fig 3 nolin et al 2021 estimated using the reconstruction mean value 1 5 standard deviation 151 3 m3 s that the most severe spring flood years had occured in 1797 1819 1861 1876 1880 1885 1888 1890 1917 1922 1928 1947 1960 1967 1979 1989 2013 and 2014 fig 3a given the variation in hydrological regimes and the number of sampled trees within each an arbitrary threshold was determined to extract the highest f12 values from each regime these thresholds were respetively f12 75 for lake duparquet f12 50 for natural rivers and f12 10 for regulated rivers fig 3 according to these three thresholds the highest values in the f12 flood ring chronologies corresponded well with the 18 years of highest reconstructed discharge years since 1771 with respectively 16 18 14 18 and 10 18 years captured for lake duparquet natural rivers and regulated rivers in each of the hydrological regimes some years with high f12 values above the pre determined thresholds did not match with the 18 most severe spring floods identified using the reconstructed spring discharge of the harricana river fig 3 and supp table 3 for the most part these years were however very close to the 151 3 m3 s threshold used to estimate the most severe spring floods supp table 3 for lake duparquet the five mismatched f12 years with values 75 1907 1909 1919 1950 and 1956 corresponded to reconstructed discharges between 125 0 and 151 1 m3 s similarly the five f12 year with values 50 for the natural rivers 1808 1826 1908 1919 and 1974 corresponded to reconstructed discharges between 125 7 and 148 8 m3 s for the regulated rivers ten f12 values 10 also corresponded to reconstructed discharge ranging from 116 2 to 151 1 m3 s ten high f12 values in regulated rivers chronology were also not indicated by equivalent high f12 values in natural rivers lake duparquet or in the reconstructed spring discharge of the harricana river fig 3 the f12 chronologies from regulated rivers never reached more than 40 with a marked decreased in f2 flood ring frequency observed after ca 1920 fig 3d looking at the individual regulated sites averaged to produce the regulated flood ring chronologies revealed that both lake sites abl and fhl recorded very little flood rings compared to the two river sites dfr and mgr results not shown these differences in flood ring chronologies f1 f2 f12 were further emphasized by the regulated driftwood river dfr 1852 2016 and mattagami river mgr 1904 2016 being significantly correlated with the reconstructed harricana river spring discharge and not the abitibi lake and frederick house lake abl fhl table 2 before the 1920s the chronologies presented few flood rings and after the 1920s flood rings matched the highest spring discharge years reconstructed for the harricana river in the unflooded control sites the flood rings observed were mostly f1 and were never present in more than 10 of the trees fig 3e flood rings series per tree and flood ring chronologies in the unflooded control sites showed no significant association with the reconstructed harricana river spring discharge table 2 fig 4 or with the 11 hydrometric records table 3 two values corresponded to the highest

in regulated rivers correlations were weaker mva r 0 29 p 0 0042 1922 2016 n r 0 14 p 0 1856 1922 2016 generally the amplitude of interannual variability was higher in mva than in n chronologies fig 5

river r 0 28 p 0 05 n 92 the highest spring discharge years reconstructed for the harricana river were well captured by mva and n chronologies from lake duparquet and natural rivers each of those chronologies showed 1947 and 1960 as the highest spring discharge magnitude in the last 250 years and the years 1880 1890 1922 1989 2013 and 2014 also shared particularily high values fig 5 correlations of earlywood vessel chronologies among river basins and hydrological regimes table 4 and with hydrometric records table 5 fig 1 were highly significant as with flood ring chronologies associations with earlywood vessel chronologies were found to be highest with lake duparquet higher among natural rivers than for regulated rivers and to weaken with increasing distance from lake duparquet tables 4 5 the lowest correlations were found between the mva and n chronologies from the upper ottawa river and the southernmost hydrometric record of kipawa river both flowing south to the saint lawrence river tables 4 5 compared to the n chronologies the mva chronologies were less associated among river basins and showed a greater number of significant correlations 10 10 vs 4 10 for mva table 4 in the structure of correlations between earlywood vessel chronologies and hydrometric records the opposite was observed the associations between mva and hydrometric records were about twice as high as with n and showed a greater number of significant associations table 5 continuous wavelet transformation allowed to investigate the temporal coherency of the earlywood vessel chronologies from the different hydrological regimes n 1 or n 2 trees to the more robust lake duparquet mva and n chronologies n 43 trees since the mva and n chronologies were significantly correlated with the regional spring discharge records it can be hypothezised that the decomposition of their periodicities may reflects the decomposition of periodicities affecting regional spring discharge three major patterns of significant high variance were observed in the power spectrum of chronologies from natural regimes fig 5 right panels a first pattern of 32 year significant periodicity was persistent in mva and n chronologies from lake duparquet up to 1850 and persisted from 1800 to 1975 in the harricana river chronologies in the upper ottawa river chronologies only the mva showed a significant 32 year periodicity affecting the variance from 1850 to 1950 a second pattern near a 16 year periodicity was more variable over time and between river basins than the 32 year pattern it started around 1850 in lake duparquet and around 1900 in other chronologies from natural rivers a third pattern was the apparition of decadal periodicities of 8 years and less from 1875 and 1900 in chronologies from natural rivers except the upper ottawa river the chronologies from the regulated mattagami river began in 1922 and were not long enough to support the accurate calculation of high periodicities low frequencies however the n chronology showed significant high variance similar to that found in natural rivers chronologies notably around a decadal periodicity in 1940 and around a 32 year periodicity from 1925 to 1980 although outside the cone of influence 4 discussion 4 1 spatial coherency among spring flood proxy from natural rivers in this study results showed that both flood ring chronologies f1 f2 f12 and earlywood tree ring anatomical chronologies mva and n hereafter referred to as spring flood proxies were highly intercorrelated spring flood proxies were strongly correlated to harricana river spring discharge and to instrumental data from eleven hydrometric records distributed across a wide boreal territory above 70 000 km2 spring flood proxies provided synchronous evidence of flooding across the four river basins with most of the major spring floods reconstructed for the harricana river for the last 250 years being recorded by f nigra trees growing along lake duparquet and natural rivers major spring floods were also recorded by f nigra trees from regulated rivers but i in comparison by very few trees and ii more often in the form of weakly defined flood rings the signal strength although appears to decrease with geographical distance to lake duparquet and in regulated rivers the high proportion of individual tree showing significant correlation to the reconstructed harricana river spring discharge among natural and to a lesser extent regulated rivers also support strong spatial coherency these results confirm the hypothesis of a common hydroclimatic variability among the four river basins sampled these results are also in line with studies reporting highly significant associations between mean cross sectional earlywood vessel lumen area mva chronologies from lake duparquet and the instrumental regional spring discharge data tardif et al 2010 kames et al 2016 nolin et al 2021 these results also support the fact that the increase in spring flood frequency and magnitude reported by nolin et al 2021 since the end of the little ice age see their reconstruction of the harricana river spring discharge is regionally coherent the similarities found at low frequencies in earlywood vessel chronologies also support spatial coherency between lake duparquet and natural rivers and point towards a decrease in the periodicities of high spring discharge since at least 1850 the frequency of high spring discharge may have changed from a persistent multi decadal periodicity in the late 19th to early 20th century to a decadal and then interannual periodicity in the late 20th century this result compares well with those of previous studies conducted in lake duparquet tardif bergeron 1997b nolin et al 2021 and hypothesizing a long term increase in the frequency and magnitude of spring flooding since the end of the little ice age 1850 1870 matthews briffa 2005 ideally the cwt analysis would have been conducted on a large number of samples per river basins to extract the strongest possible common signal as it was done with the mva and n chronologies from lake duparquet indeed it is possible that factors related to age or stand dynamics may interfere with the hydroclimatic signal in earlywood vessel chronologies tardif and conciatori 2006b for example the sample from upper ottawa river presented a lot of suppressed years very small annual ring width and its mva chronology was not significantly correlated with that of lake duparquet however the consistency expressed by the mva and n chronologies consisting of 1 to 2 trees per river basin compared to the robust lake duparquet chronologies n 43 still demonstrates a strong common signal at both high and low frequencies it was also demonstrated that five f nigra samples may be sufficient to reconstruct most of the interannual variability of the harricana river spring discharge during the 20th century eps 0 85 rbar 0 20 nolin et al 2021 given the similarities observed in the power spectrum of the sampled rivers it would nevertheless be interesting to conduct this cwt analysis on a larger number of samples and to study their associations with large scale atmospheric circulations in north america and at different periodicities 4 2 comparison of spring flood proxies among natural rivers regulated rivers and unflooded control sites compared to f nigra trees growing along the floodplain of naturally flowing rivers those from regulated rivers and from unflooded sites recorded flood rings less frequently and mainly of the weaker type f1 flood ring chronologies from regulated rivers showed little interannual variability and were also less correlated with hydrometric records spring floods identified by flood rings were most coherent with those of natural rivers prior to dam creation in the 1920 s and for a few extreme floods thereafter e g 1947 1960 some weak flood rings f1 were also recorded on regulated rivers although they have not been recorded on natural rivers and lake duparquet and could be the result of dam management maneuvers furthermore trees were generally younger in floodplain sites located along regulated rivers compared to that along natural rivers and lake duparquet suggesting that the construction of the dams may have had a detrimental effect on the existing ash forests in hydrological system that were regulated dewine and cooper 2007 demonstrated for instance that dam construction threatened the recruitment and the persistence of old growth riparian forests in the upper colorado river historically in ontario most dams were built to raise the water level to the high water mark identified by surveyors using signs on the landscape ontario geological survey 1920 since the dams were built to hold water until the maximum natural flood elevation it is likely that the old riparian forests have been permanently flooded and removed from the landscape the potential to accurately reconstruct the historical variability of today s regulated rivers can therefore be lower due to a lack of ancient trees however the few trees sampled on the regulated rivers did record flood rings and this demonstrates that flood ring can be suitable proxy to retrieve partial historical discharge records from the trees growing in the shoreline of regulated rivers in addition further work is needed to assess sites differences in regulated hydrological systems our results indicated variations in the recording of flood rings by f nigra trees located along lakes regulated by downstream dams single dam system and rivers regulated by both upstream and downstream dams multi dam system it would be interesting to systematically compare flood rings in trees located upstream and downstream of dams and according to their position on the bank relative to the shoreline to determine if the hydrological signal provided by flood ring can be improved by a more targeted sampling strategy differences in height between dams may also have impacted downstream water levels and flood rings differently in the unflooded control sites the trees were as old as at lake duparquet but had little or no flood rings with solely few f1 being observed the maximum value of f12 never reached more than 10 and flood rings were not consistent among samples they also did not match the years for which flooding was observed in other river basins either from the spring flood proxies the reconstruction of the harricana river spring discharge or from the regional hydrometric records this confirms that f nigra trees from flooded and unflooded sites carry different climatic signals mainly because their exposures to water stress and drought are different tardif and bergeron 1997a kames 2009 previous studies in the lake duparquet region showed for example that earlywood vessel chronologies from unflooded non riparian f nigra stands were i not significantly correlated to those developed from flooded riparian stands and ii presented no significant correlations with instrumental spring discharge kames 2009 this is also sustained by ring width chronologies developed by tardif and bergeron 1997a and kames 2009 showing a lack of crossdating between riparian and non riparian f nigra trees the physiological mechanisms of flood ring formation are still poorly understood but it was hypothesized that stem submersion induces the production of ethylene which in turn interacts with other growth regulators thus affecting the formation of earlywood vessels yamamoto et al 1995 st george et al 2002 copini et al 2016 it is therefore unlikely that periods of high humidity runoff rainfall etc in topographically flat upland forests will cause a physiological response similar to that of flooding in riparian forests 4 3 adequacy between spring flood proxies advantages and limitations spring flood proxies developed in this study f1 f2 f12 mva n were shown to provide similar and complementary information on high spring discharge variability at an annual resolution the continuous quantitative measurement of earlywood vessels allowed the extraction of a broader spectrum of hydrological variability compared to the semi quantitative visual identification of flood rings which provided event year chronologies among the flood rings chronologies f1 and f2 in lake duparquet and natural rivers captured very comparable signal but their summation f12 captured a slightly broader spectrum of hydrological conditions associated with high spring discharge this result suggest that it is worth identifying both weak f1 and strong f2 flood ring types it is hypothesized that differences between f1 and f2 in f nigra trees for a given year may be reflecting differences in coring height or tree exposure elevation and topography to flooding in flood years it has been shown that the decrease in earlywood vessel size is maximum at the base of the trees with a gradual decrease along the trunk height st george and nielsen 2002 st george et al 2002 furthermore the timing intensity and duration of spring floods will also impact the ability of riparian f nigra trees to record a flood ring st george et al 2002 had showed for instance that the duration of flooding had a greater influence than the peak flood stage on the size of earlywood vessels in flooded quercus macrocarpa among the anatomical chronologies mva and n showed comparable associations to instrumental and reconstructed spring discharge although we cannot robustly assert this result given the limited number of samples that have been used associations between n chronologies and spring discharge were generally higher between river basins and in regulated rivers than with mva chronologies it could thus be hypothesized that earlywood vessels area and number carry slightly different hydrological signal associated with spring flooding in natural and regulated rivers kames et al 2016 showed that the mva and n chronologies extracted from flooded f nigra trees from lake duparquet were associated with climate at slightly different periods the mva and n chronologies were associated with mean monthly temperatures and total precipitation from april to may and april to june respectively in terms of advantages and limitations the use of the various spring flood proxies f12 mva or n depends on the objectives pursued and the resources available e g number of trees equipment while quick to develop visually derived flood ring chronologies like that of numerous pointer years involve processing a larger number of samples and require conventional dendrochronology equipment tardif and conciatori 2006a therrell and bialecki 2015 meko and therrell 2020 continuous earlywood vessels chronologies require fewer samples but is demanding in image analysis equipment and software as well as extensive analysis time kames et al 2016 nolin et al 2021 relative frequencies provide information on the number of samples affected per year while continuous chronologies provide annual quantitative information tardif and conciatori 2006a however it could be hypothesized that as the number of samples increases the relative frequency of flood rings could approximate the hydrological signal extracted by earlywood vessel chronologies composed of far fewer samples it would thus be possible to use relative frequencies of flood rings as spring discharge predictors in reconstruction models even if conventionally flood ring frequencies has been used to identify past flooding and not for the purpose of quantitative reconstruction st george nielsen 2002 therrell and bialecki 2015 meko and therrell 2020 examples of approaches combining both discrete and continuous flood proxies to reconstruct spring discharge can be found in boucher et al 2011 and in nicault et al 2014 5 conclusion in a context of climate change river regulation and disappearance of old riparian forests the study of spring flood proxies is becoming a necessity in water management and flood risk assessment in northern territories this study demonstrated the strong spatial coherency associated with the use of two spring flood proxies in naturally flowing rivers from eastern boreal canada it also stressed the potential limitation associated with the use of flood rings from trees growing along regulated water bodies flood rings and direct measurement of the earlywood vessels captured high resolution comparable and complementary spring flooding evidence even in regulated rivers partial spring flooding history can be inferred from flood rings prior to dam creation results underline the potential and utility of extending the use of these spring flood proxies in dendrohydrology future work could study flood rings over a larger area by sampling for example one natural river per watershed to monitor historical trends in large scale spring floods and study the potential effects of climate change flood ring methods could be applied to more southern river basins such as saint lawrence river or ottawa river it would then be necessary to study the presence of flood rings in species such as green ash

4713,trend analyses are widely used to check for climate change effects on hydrological systems however often inconsistent patterns have been found that is non significant as well as significant but opposing trends in the same data set these inconsistencies have often been ascribed to local mostly anthropogenic effects like wetland draining or land use change in this study local effects were subtracted from time series of lake water level and groundwater head covering a 28 years period in northeast germany but this did hardly affect the observed inconsistent trends in contrast the apparent inconsistent behavior could be ascribed to different degrees of low pass filtering of the groundwater recharge signal due to successively increasing attenuation of high frequency oscillations during the passage through the vadose zone minor long term oscillations in the input signal became increasingly more visible resulting in apparent monotonic trends for the 28 year period there is strong evidence that this phenomenon could be ascribed to frequency dependent damping of the input signal which has been found for a wide range of natural processes including hydrological systems keywords groundwater head lake water level trend analysis low pass filtering frequency dependent damping power spectrum 1 introduction direct anthropogenic effects as well as long term climate change are expected to cause major shifts in long term climate and hydrological time series milly et al 2008 correspondingly trend analysis of respective state variables is very common in order to check for these effects hamed 2008 lins 2005 for northeast germany a long term decrease of water availability has been predicted holsten et al 2009 huang et al 2010 wegehenkel and kersebaum 2009 in fact significantly decreasing trends of groundwater head and lake water level have been observed during the last three decades germer et al 2011 heinrich et al 2018 kaiser et al 2014a climate change effects might have been even amplified by direct anthropogenic effects åkesson et al 2016 germer et al 2011 merz and pekdeger 2011 natkhin et al 2012 however opposing trends have been observed in this region as well kaiser et al 2014a the same applies to lake water level studied in 32 lakes in an adjacent region in north poland wrzesiński and ptak 2016 these have often been interpreted as deviations from a general regional trend due to local natural or anthropogenic effects germer et al 2011 wrzesiński and ptak 2016 similar inconsistent trends for observation wells close to each other have been reported recently from other regions e g ayers et al 2019 haas and birk 2017 lorenzo lacruz et al 2017 qiao et al 2019 and for other climatological and hydrological observables hamed 2008 lins 2005 pilon and yue 2002 and references therein thus any identification of clear cause effect relationships seems to be a tedious task åkesson et al 2016 in contrast it has been argued that apparent linear trends might rather be part of low frequency oscillations that are characteristic for climatological and hydrological time series as a consequence of frequency dependent damping of input signals it has often been related to the hurst phenomenon persistence scaling behavior etc hurst 1951 koutsoyiannis and montanari 2007 mandelbrot and van ness 1968 although the latter is not a necessary prerequisite for the former it could result in apparently arbitrary monotonic trends even for longer periods irrespective of any clear trend in driving variables koutsoyiannis 2006 in fact numerous studies have found low frequency oscillations of runoff groundwater head and lake water with a period length of some decades gudmundsson et al 2011 garcía molinos et al 2015 neves et al 2016 shun and duffy 1999 that could be confused with montonic trends at shorter time scales in addition low frequency oscillations can differ substantially between adjacent sites garcía molinos et al 2015 it is felt that the implications of these effects are still strongly underestimated in environmental and geo sciences as well as in water resources management koutsoyiannis 2006 2013 to study this in real world data sets local effects need to be systematically factored out this was done by applying a principal component analysis to a set of time series of lake water level and groundwater head in northeast germany covering a 28 years period and partly exhibiting significant trends but with differing signs local effects were subtracted from the observations following the approach by lischeid et al 2010 and hohenbrink et al 2016 the residuals were then analyzed with respect to consistent long term trends compared to that of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration 2 data time series of lake water level and groundwater head were provided from the environmental authorities of the federal states of mecklenburg vorpommern and brandenburg and by the leibniz institute of freshwater ecology and inland fisheries for a region rich in lakes that formed during the last weichselian glaciation kaiser et al 2012 it extends along a 180 km distance from lake müritz about 110 km northwest of berlin to lake schwielochsee 75 km southeast of berlin fig 1 only data from sites without any clear direct anthropogenic impact have been considered except for lake schwielochsee fig 1 in total time series from 23 lakes and 17 groundwater wells for a 40 year period november 1985 to october 2013 were analyzed in this region repeated advances and retreats of inland glaciers during the pleistocene resulted in a complex setting of unconsolidated sediments with high textural heterogeneity mostly of 100 200 m thickness here complex stacked aquifer systems developed partly confined but usually of unknown number and extent of single aquifers e g pöschke et al 2018 where groundwater flow direction can differ between various storeys in addition groundwater flow direction in single aquifers can vary between dry and wet years holzbecher 2001 thus any delineation of watersheds or capture zones is prone to substantial uncertainties correspondingly land use effects can only tentatively be assessed by that of the immediate surroundings table 1 lakes are partly topographically isolated endorheic lakes partly interlinked by streams exorheic lakes the stream network has been substantially extended by man during the last millennium and exhibits numerous weirs kaiser et al 2018 flow velocity in the streams usually is very low due to low relief intensity occasional desiccation has been observed in many streams but has rarely been monitored systematically long term time series of meteorological data at daily intervals were used from five sites in the study region operated by the german weather service fig 1 the region is located in the transition zone between oceanic climate in the northwest and more continental climate in the southeast annual mean temperature is about 9 c annual mean precipitation is between 520 and 550 mm yr 1 and tends to decrease towards southeast 3 methods for statistical analyses and graphs the r software version 3 1 0 r core team 2014 was used 3 1 preprocessing of data application of the principal component analysis to time series of lake water level and groundwater head required synchronous and gap free data sets temporal resolution was once per month at least with mid month readings mostly but not strictly synchronously at different sites thus measured data were linearly interpolated to the 15th day of each month defined as support points this is justified by the pronounced autocorrelation of groundwater head and lake water level data lischeid et al 2010 selection of sites and period aimed at a maximum number of sites and a maximum length with a minimum of data gaps gaps were defined as cases were no observation data were available within a 28 days interval around the mid month support points gap less time series were available for 31 sites seven sites exhibited up to four gaps at three sites major gaps of 11 or 12 months were encountered i e for groundwater well fredersdorf 32 between 15 may 2010 and 01 june 2011 well bergfeld between 15 october 1987 and 15 november 1988 and for lake sprockfitz between 15 october 1985 and 15 november 1986 weekly or daily data were available from some sites these data were synchronized to weekly data as well to be used for power spectrum analysis gaps in meterological time series were filled by regression with data from adjacent sites precipitation was corrected to account for the wind and evaporation error after richter 1995 potential evapotranspiration was assessed as reference crop evapotranspiration according to allen et al 1998 based on air temperature and duration of sunshine data or global radiation modified by wendling 1991 daily climatic water balance was calculated as the difference between precipitation and reference crop evapotranspiration 3 2 significance tests a p 0 05 level of significance was used throughout for significance testing differences between two groups of sampling sites with respect to loadings on principal components were tested using the mann whitney test routine wilcox test r core team 2014 the kendall rank correlation package kendall mcleod 2011 was used to test for monotonic relationships between metrically scaled variables this test gives rather exact assessments of p values for ties none of the two tests requires any specific distribution of the data or homoscedasticity time series were tested for significance of monotonic trends using the mann kendall test kendall 1975 with correction for serial correlation according to yue et al 2002 the magnitude of significant trends was assessed using the approach presented by sen 1968 the analysis was performed using the zyp package bronaugh and werner 2009 in contrast to lake water level and groundwater head trend analysis of the meteorological data was performed for daily rather than monthly data for the november 1985 to october 2013 period due to larger statistical power 3 3 principal component analysis principal component analysis pca performs an eigenvalue decomposition of a covariance matrix of a multivariate data set in order to identify orthogonal principal components defined by the eigenvectors applications of pca on time series of observables that have been measured synchronously at different locations is a common approach in climatology and meteorology where it has been termed the empirical orthogonal functions eof approach jolliffe 2002 vereecken et al 2016 when time series are inputted into the principal component analysis pca the resulting principal components can be regarded as archetypal time series single observed time series can then be represented by linear regression to the principal components pc longuevergne et al 2007 lischeid et al 2010 and lehr et al 2015 give some examples for application on groundwater head data gottschalk 1985 and thomas et al 2012 on discharge data and jawson and niemann 2007 and hohenbrink et al 2016 on soil moisture data in this study the prcomp routine was used r core team 2014 loadings of time series on selected pc lpc1 lpc2 etc that is the pearson correlation coefficient for comparison of single observed time series with selected pc can be used as a quantitative assessment of the respective effect size at single sites jolliffe 2002 due to normalization of the observed time series to unit variance principal components with an eigenvalue exceeding unity reflect effects that necessarily concern more than just a single time series in contrast local effects restricted to single sites are depicted by principal components with much smaller eigenvalues thus to factor out local effects from the observed time series they are projected onto the principal components with eigenvalues exceeding unity projection is performed by multivariate linear regression of the time series with those of the respective principal components details of that approach are given by lehr and lischeid 2020 3 4 spectrum analysis and low pass filtering any discrete time series can be decomposed into a set of sine and cosine functions of different frequencies without any loss of information fourier transformation the sum of squared coefficients of the respective sine and cosine function that is the power is then proportional to the fraction of variance explained by oscillation of the respective frequency plotting power versus frequencies yields a graph of power spectrum density it provides information e g about the weighting of low versus high frequency patterns in the respective time series the fourier transformation is often applied to the autocorrelation function of the time series rather than directly to the genuine time series power spectrum analysis was performed by subjecting the results of autocorrelation analysis routine acf r core team 2014 to the routine spectrum r core team 2014 in order to achieve sufficient frequency resolution it was applied only to data with weekly resolution at least this applied to time series of groundwater head at six sites for the sake of comparability with the groundwater head data readings of the same weekly dates from daily meteorological data and daily data of lake stechlin water level were used for that analysis for the weather station lindenberg fig 1 daily meteorological data for the 01 april 1906 to 31 october 2013 period were used to compile a long term time series of climatic water balance as a proxy of groundwater recharge this time series was subjected to low pass filtering to mimic the proposed low pass filtering of the groundwater recharge signal in a first step a fourier analysis of the time series of n data points x ti at dates ti normalized to zero mean was performed yielding a set of coefficients ak for different frequencies 1 a k 2 n i 1 n x t i e 2 π i k n t i f o r k n 2 1 n 2 low pass filtering was then applied by the inverse fourier transform 2 x t i k n 2 1 n 2 e 2 i k n a k where a k a k a k n 2 b the degree of low pass filtering is adjusted by the coefficient b where b 0 denotes no filtering at all and b 0 denotes strong low pass filtering 4 results 4 1 factoring out local effects by principal component analysis principal component analysis aimed at decomposing the time series of lake water level and groundwater head into a general that is regional and a more specific local part each in a rather conservative approach the general part was assessed via principal components with eigenvalues exceeding unity this holds for the first four principal components that explained 88 53 25 7 and 3 of the variance of the data set except for lake schwielochsee 28 of the variance between 68 and 98 of the variance was explained for each of the remaining sites and more than 80 for 35 out of 40 sites thus local effects including direct anthropogenic effects like groundwater extraction obviously played only a minor role for most of the investigated sites in addition the effect of filling data gaps by linear interpolation seemed to be negligible as the respective sites groundwater wells fredersdorf 32 and bergdorf and lake sprockfitz did not stand out in regard to explained variance 0 93 0 94 and 0 86 respectively fig 2 a shows the loadings of all 40 time series on the 1st and 2nd principal component pc these first two principal components depict 78 of the variance of the data set symbols close to the outer unit circle dashed line indicate time series where most of the variance is depicted by the first two pc like for lake stechlin 89 of variance corresponding to findings in other studies where pca was applied to a set of hydrological time series gottschalk 1985 hohenbrink and lischeid 2015 lehr and lischeid 2020 the 1st pc was similar to a time series of spatial averages of normalized values at all 40 sites for each date of the time series thus it reflected the mean behavior averaged of all sites the second pc has often been found to reflect the degree of transformation of the hydrological input signal in the vadose zone hohenbrink and lischeid 2015 lischeid et al 2010 lehr and lischeid 2020 that is the degree of damping and delaying compared to the precipitation signal in fact this holds for this study as well although with inversed sign time series exhibiting very responsive behavior like water level at lake zeutensee exhibited strong positive correlation with the second pc fig 2 the opposite is true for very smooth time series like groundwater head at well bergfeld fig 2 this degree of transformation can be quantified by a damping coefficient d based on the loadings lpc1 lpc2 on the first and second pc lischeid et al 2010 thus factoring out all other effects 4 d arctan l p c 2 l p c 1 here low negative values denote weak transformation and high positive values strong transformation among all 40 time series that of water level at lake zeutensee exhibited a minimum damping coefficient of d 1 54 and that of groundwater well bergfeld gw a maximum of 1 07 fig 2 for these sites time series are given fig 2b where the effects of additional pcs have been subtracted in general time series with high positive damping coefficients exhibit a more smooth shape correspondingly autocorrelation for lag 1 month is highly significantly correlated with the damping coefficient p 0 001 in addition time series with positive damping coefficients lag behind those with negative damping coefficients accounting to up to three months for single time series compared to that of the lowest damping coefficient fig 2b this study focuses on analysis of inconsistent trends rather than at ascribing principal components to various processes of physical factors thus the third and fourth component are only shortly described here loadings of the time series on the third pc differed significantly p 0 001 between sites with pure forest land cover in up to 1 km distance compared to those of mixed land use exorheic and endorheic lakes differed with respect to loadings on the first and third principal component although on the edge of insignificance p 0 047 in both cases time series of lake water level and groundwater head differed significantly from each other p 0 002 with respect to the fourth component only which comprised 3 of the total variance in addition loadings on that component were significantly correlated with the northings please note that the share of lakes tended to increase towards the north fig 1 although not significantly p 0 08 no significant correlations were found for the first four principal components with respect to eastings altitude of groundwater head or lake water level mean depth to groundwater mean or maximum water depth lake area or lake volume not shown 4 2 trend analysis time series of lake water level and groundwater head were tested for significant monotonic trends for the whole 1985 2013 period on the one hand the genuine time series were directly subjected to the trend analysis on the other hand possible local and direct anthropogenic effects were subtracted thus reducing the variance by 12 on average the latter differed from the unmodified data with respect to the significance of the trend at three out of eleven single sites but hardly in regard to trend size r2 0 998 in either case 11 out of 40 time series 27 5 of all time series exhibited significant trends fig 3 both for the genuine time series as well as for the time series adjusted for local effects significantly increasing trends were found only for time series with low damping coefficients and significantly decreasing trends only for those with high damping coefficients in addition time series of daily precipitation potential evapotranspiration and the climatic water balance as the difference of the two were tested for significant monotonic trends for the same period a significant increase was found only for potential evapotranspiration at one out of five sites and a significant decrease of the climatic water balance at three out of five sites precipitation did not exhibit a significant trend at any of the five weather stations fig 4 however for none of these observables the size of the trend exceeded 0 02 mm yr 1 that is 0 54 mm for the whole 28 year period this is about two orders of magnitude smaller than those of the strongest trends found in lake water level and groundwater head data fig 3 4 3 relating trends to low pass filtering to elucidate the interplay between signal transformation in the vadose zone quantified by the damping coefficient on the one side and monotonic trends on the other side fig 5 presents time series of lake stechlin water level and groundwater head from various observation wells all at 3 5 km distance from the lake land use is forest exclusively for the whole stechlin region table 1 except for some minor settlements and has been so for decades the higher the damping coefficient the more the seasonal pattern was damped and the more low frequency patterns became clear this effect was related to mean depth to groundwater that is the thickness of the vadose zone in addition long term trends inverse all time series in the upper row of panels of fig 5 a d with d 0 exhibited a significant increase and the two time series in the lower panel e f with d 0 a significant decrease during the 1985 2013 period the set of time series clearly reflects a successive transformation with increasing damping coefficient rather than systematic differences between time series with increasing or decreasing trend respectively it has been argued that damping of the hydrological signal in the soil can be described as a low pass filtering process then the slope of the power spectrum can be used as a measure to quantify the latter the slope of the power spectrum of time series of precipitation is close to zero indicating approximately the same share of variance in the high frequency range compared to the low frequency range fig 6 in contrast the power spectrum of potential evapotranspiration decreases towards the higher frequencies right side of the bottom right graph indicating less variance in the high frequency range the slope of the power spectrum of the time series of the climatic water balance as the difference between these two variables exhibits an intermediate slope in contrast the power spectrum of lake water level and groundwater head fig 6 shows a much stronger decline towards the high frequencies this is equivalent to the frequency dependent damping of sound in air or in solid materials attenuation of high frequencies is much stronger compared to that of low frequencies consequently sound becomes duller during transmission through air harris 1966 international organization for standardization 1993 or through a concrete wall the same applies to hydrological signals that propagate as pressure waves in the subsurface to check whether the observed trends on groundwater head and lake water level could be ascribed to low pass filtering of a climate signal without any clear trend a long time series of climatic water balance data was subjected to different degrees of low pass filtering the time series of climatic water balance was calculated for daily meteorological data of the lindenberg weather station fig 1 covering the 01 april 1906 to 31 october 2013 period a high degree of low pass filtering did not only yield very smooth time series but also a clear negative trend during the last decades as part of a low frequency pattern fig 7 similar to that observed at some groundwater wells with high damping coefficient cf fig 5 lower row however the increasing trend observed at other sites cf fig 5 upper row could not be reproduced not shown 5 discussion this study aims at testing two competing hypotheses to explain inconsistent trends observed in 28 year time series of lake water level and groundwater head in northeast germany the first hypothesis ascribes inconsistent trends to local that is presumably anthropogenic effects at single sites to that end local effects were factored out using principal component analysis the second hypothesis states that low frequency patterns in meteorological driver variables are masked by high frequency patterns the latter are increasingly stripped off during passage of the hydrological signal through the vadose zone consequently low frequency patterns become increasingly more clear when the period length of prevailing frequencies is at least roughly double the length of the study period the visible range of that pattern might be mistaken as a continuous trend 5 1 inconsistent trends trend analysis is easy to perform and thus has often been used to check for climate change effects or anthropogenic effects in environmental data the term trend analysis usually is used in a rather narrow sense for testing for a linear or monotonic trend of the mean value of a time series the basic assumption is often that significant trends at the scale of years or decades would indicate major changes previous work in the study region gave clear evidence for substantial oscillations of lake water level at the scale of decades kaiser et al 2015 up to millennia dietze et al 2016 kaiser et al 2014b corresponding results have been reported from a similar region in poland by starkel et al 1996 from southern central europe by magny 2004 and from ireland by garcía molinos et al 2015 likewise todhunter and fietzek devries 2016 found evidence for substantial multi decadal and centennial oscillations of the water level of the devils lake north dakota usa during the last 4000 years that they ascribed to the dynamics of hydroclimatic forcing including the catastrophic flooding during the last two decades gudmundsson et al 2011 describe low frequency patterns for runoff data from numerous catchments all over europe and clarke 2007 for south america thus results of the analysis of linear or monotonic trends are necessarily restricted to limited time periods however that does not explain why trends of the same observable but at different sites usually differ not only in strength but even in sign not only monotonic trends but even the degree of low frequency oscillations can differ substantially between adjacent sites at the scale of decades garcía molinos et al 2015 or of centuries to millennia as indicated by rather poor correlation between palaeo records of lake water level within a small region starkel et al 1996 5 2 first hypothesis inconsistent trends are due to local peculiarities trends of lake water level and groundwater head were not closely related to those of climatological variables firstly trends in the driving meteorological variables as far as they were significant were very small and unlikely to result in the observed major differences between sites fig 4 secondly these trends could not explain trends of lake water level and groundwater head with opposing signs within a few km distance fig 3 thirdly the maximum time shift between corresponding peaks in time series exhibiting different damping coefficients was three months fig 2 a temporal delay that short could not explain the observed inconsistent trends e g groundwater head at some sites responding to climatological input of preceding decades and others to more recent input please note that this holds for the pressure signal only and must not be mismatched with groundwater age dating data principal components exceeding an eigenvalue of one were considered indicative for non local effects on lake water level and groundwater head thus more than two third of the variance at all sites could be ascribed to regional rather than local effects except for lake schwielochsee fig 2 here up to 75 of the variance had to be ascribed to local effects the river spree runs through the lake which discharges a region with massive open cast mining and corresponding extensive dewatering grünewald 2001 schoenheinz et al 2011 however even at this site natural processes added onto the observed dynamics rather than substituting them the principal component analysis allowed extracting the respective pieces of information that were related to natural processes cf hohenbrink et al 2016 lehr and lischeid 2020 for the remaining sites possible local effects were substantially smaller but could not fully be ruled out in contrast to common assumptions however neither direct anthropogenic effects nor land use or systematic differences between groundwater head and lake water level or between exorheic and endorheic lakes seemed to have played a major role in this data set factoring out local effects had only minor effects on sign and strength of monotonic trends figs 3 and 5 even more important the correlation between trends and damping effects was hardly modified fig 5 thus inconsistent trends of lake water level and groundwater head could not be ascribed to local effects instead there was a systematic shift from time series with low damping coefficient often exhibiting a significant long term increase to time series with high damping coefficient partly exhibiting a significant decrease similar observations are reported from other studies although without establishing a causal connection van der maaten et al 2015 found significantly decreasing lake water levels in two out of three studied lakes in this region for the 1988 2010 period the third lake did not exhibit any trend but a much more pronounced seasonal pattern pointing to much less damping of the input signal pathak and dodamani 2019 investigated groundwater level trends in 59 wells in the ghataprabha river basin in southwest india the data set was divided into three clusters that reflected different degrees of short term oscillations decreasing trends were detected in 81 of the wells in the cluster of least fluctuating groundwater heads but substantially less in the other two clusters with more responsive time series in addition some wells even exhibited opposing trends in the latter two clusters dong et al 2019 report on slight rising trends in shallow groundwater in contrast to distinctive declining trends in deep groundwater in a set of 575 wells in the mid atlantic region of the united states they ascribe these differences to the delayed response of the deep groundwater to changes of precipitation in our study though maximal delay time between different wells did not exceed three months which could not explain opposing trends in our 28 year data set cf fig 5 5 3 second hypothesis inconsistent trends result from a misconception of low pass filtering processes it has been argued that frequency dependent damping of input signals could explain patterns of inconsistent trends in hydrological time series according to that apparent long term monotonic trends can evolve from very low frequency oscillations with period lengths of decades centuries or even longer cohn and lins 2005 hamed 2008 lins and cohn 2011 low frequency oscillations are already part of the meteorological input signal bordi et al 2009 but are masked by much stronger high frequency patterns and become visible only when the latter are increasingly more attenuated this so called low pass filtering is a typical feature of dissipative processes like heat dispersion in water bodies cyr and cyr 2003 seepage fluxes gudmundsson et al 2011 katul et al 2007 shun and duffy 1999 and solute transport gall et al 2013 kirchner et al 2010 in the vadose zone and water transport kleidon et al 2013 in catchments in either case the energy of the input signal dissipates resulting in a delay and in a damping of amplitudes with increasing strength of damping that is increasing attenuation of high frequency patterns even more lower frequency patterns become visible katul et al 2007 in this study it was by chance only that different trends with opposing signs showed up for different degrees of damping in general probability of a significant trend increases systematically with increasing smoothness of the time series that is at sites with high damping factors often the slope of the power spectrum has been used to quantify the degree of damping of the input signal in the vadose zone katul et al 2007 kirchner et al 2010 neves et al 2016 like in this study other measures have been used as well e g gall et al 2013 hohenbrink and lischeid 2015 showed that the damping behavior could be described by the first two components of a principal component analysis of the respective set of time series of soil moisture in fact the differing degrees of damping of the input signal observed in time series of groundwater head can be traced back to vadose zone processes lischeid et al 2017a 2017b this is confirmed e g by shun and duffy 1999 who studied low frequency oscillations in precipitation temperature and runoff at various sites within a mountainous catchment along an elevation gradient they found increasingly more pronounced low frequency oscillations at lower elevation that they ascribe to decreasing suppression of high frequency patterns that prevail in the meteorological input data correspondingly increasing persistence in hydrological time series has been related recently to properties which likely reflect a higher degree of damping of the hydrological input signal e g catchment size dey and mujumdar 2018 markonis et al 2018 the ratio of pervious over impervious areas in the catchment jovanovic et al 2018 or higher persistence in speleothem compared to tree ring based paleoclimatic records iliopoulou et al 2018 in order to check whether the observed low frequency patterns of groundwater head dynamics could be ascribed to low pass filtering of a climate signal the climatic water balance was taken as a proxy for groundwater recharge the time series of the climatic water balance did neither exhibit a significant trend nor any dominant frequency fig 7 in spite of that pronounced low pass filtering of that signal resulted in a low frequency pattern that resembled that observed in some of the groundwater observation wells with high damping coefficients fig 7 cf fig 5 thus supporting the hypothesis correspondingly e g boutt 2016 reported on significant either positive or negative 40 years trends in 12 of the studied precipitation stations and stream gauges but in 60 of the observation wells in the same region in new england usa with 75 73 and 83 spatial replicates each to summarize climate and hydrological time series exhibit random fluctuation at different scales national research council 1991 koutsoyiannis 2002 which should not be confused with instationarity of the underlying processes montanari and koutsoyiannis 2014 koutsoyiannis and montanari 2015 trend analysis is sensitive to low frequency patterns that become visible only when the high frequency part is stripped off the low pass filtering applied in this study does not consider time lags thus the low pass filtered time series run ahead of the actually observed time series of groundwater head more severely long term trends observed at other wells with less strong damping could not be reproduced this might be due to various reasons first of all the climatic water balance is only a crude approximation of the true groundwater recharge it does neither consider higher evapotranspiration of larger plants compared to short cut grass nor reduction of evapotranspiration after crop harvesting grassland harvesting or grazing or due to limited water availability e g at the end of the growing season secondly the power spectrum of measured groundwater head and lake water level fig 6 exhibits more scatter compared to those of the low pass filtering exercise fig 7 both effects likely play a major role especially in the higher frequency range that is for less strongly damped time series consequently the behavior effects could not be mimicked for these sites the resulting phenomenon of significant trends arising apparently out of nothing is closely related to the concept of stochastic resonance it means that in non linear systems a noisy input pattern might amplify system inherent weak periodicities thus exceeding a crucial threshold and pushing the system to a new state nicolis 1982 and benzi et al 1982 introduced the concept of stochastic resonance as a potential trigger mechanism for the glaciation cycles during the pleistocene the concept has since then been extended and has been applied to numerous non linear systems in various scientific disciplines including e g neurophysiology or quantum physics gammaitoni et al 1998 however the notion of noise needs to be reconsidered in environmental sciences this term is often used according to the concept in radio technology where the signal is provided by the low frequency part of an electromagnetic wave and high frequency noise adds to that due to technological imperfections correspondingly environmental scientists tend to consider the low frequency part the signal to be separated from high frequency noise however in case of hydrological processes meteorological variables impose a high frequency signal from which low frequency patterns at greater depth evolve due to progressive attenuation of the high frequency part of the input signal thus the role of high frequency and low frequency patterns is rather inverse to the common perception in environmental sciences 6 conclusions inconsistent trends were found in 28 year time series of lake water level and groundwater head at 40 sites in northeast germany even when local effects had been factored out instead we found strong evidence for the decisive role of low pass filtering of hydrological input signals in this regard we observed that during passage of infiltrated water through the vadose zone the hydrological input signal became increasingly more damped in addition to a certain time delay damping occured as a low pass filtering of the input signal thus minor high frequency oscillations in the climatological time series became increasingly more attenuated and the inherent low frequency patterns became increasingly more clear resulting in apparent monotonic trends for limited time periods strength and sign of these trends was closely related to the degree of low pass filtering of the hydrological input signal in the vadose zone which differed substantially even between adjacent sites oscillations occuring at all time scales have often been observed in climatological and hydrological time series and have been ascribed to persistence bordi et al 2009 garcía molinos et al 2015 koutsoyiannis 2006 lins and cohn 2011 however diagnosis of persistence in practice often yields unstable results due to restricted length of the available time series bordi et al 2009 hodgkins et al 2017 koutsoyiannis 2013 but persistence is not a necessary prerequisite for frequency dependent damping of input signals this study has shown that the latter clearly needs to be taken into account in trend analysis studies for scenario analyses of long term changes usually clear trends or stepwise changes are imposed on model input data to study the system s response inversely it is often argued that hydrological response cannot exhibit any clear trend without a corresponding clear trend of the driving data this study provides some examples that this does not necessarily hold true hydrological modelling as well as many field studies rarely account for frequency dependent damping in spite of clear theoretical evidence koutsoyiannis 2013 whereas this might be reasonable for short term dynamics it obviously falls short when long term trends are studied we conclude that trend analysis turns out to be anything but easy to apply and easy to understand rather identifying major changes in a world of permanent changes remains a major scientific challenge presence or absence of clear trends in groundwater head or lake water level time series does not necessarily confirm or disprove a major system shift correspondingly our results do neither imply that climate change does not occur nor that climate change would not affect hydrological processes rather they point to the fact that climate change or direct anthropogenic effects are much more difficult to identify in real world data sets than widely presumed cf natkhin et al 2012 correspondingly the recommendation using trend analysis to test for possible direct anthropogenic effects on groundwater quantity in regards to the european water framework directive clearly is at odds with some fundamental features of hydrological systems behavior credit authorship contribution statement gunnar lischeid conceptualization methodology software

4713,trend analyses are widely used to check for climate change effects on hydrological systems however often inconsistent patterns have been found that is non significant as well as significant but opposing trends in the same data set these inconsistencies have often been ascribed to local mostly anthropogenic effects like wetland draining or land use change in this study local effects were subtracted from time series of lake water level and groundwater head covering a 28 years period in northeast germany but this did hardly affect the observed inconsistent trends in contrast the apparent inconsistent behavior could be ascribed to different degrees of low pass filtering of the groundwater recharge signal due to successively increasing attenuation of high frequency oscillations during the passage through the vadose zone minor long term oscillations in the input signal became increasingly more visible resulting in apparent monotonic trends for the 28 year period there is strong evidence that this phenomenon could be ascribed to frequency dependent damping of the input signal which has been found for a wide range of natural processes including hydrological systems keywords groundwater head lake water level trend analysis low pass filtering frequency dependent damping power spectrum 1 introduction direct anthropogenic effects as well as long term climate change are expected to cause major shifts in long term climate and hydrological time series milly et al 2008 correspondingly trend analysis of respective state variables is very common in order to check for these effects hamed 2008 lins 2005 for northeast germany a long term decrease of water availability has been predicted holsten et al 2009 huang et al 2010 wegehenkel and kersebaum 2009 in fact significantly decreasing trends of groundwater head and lake water level have been observed during the last three decades germer et al 2011 heinrich et al 2018 kaiser et al 2014a climate change effects might have been even amplified by direct anthropogenic effects åkesson et al 2016 germer et al 2011 merz and pekdeger 2011 natkhin et al 2012 however opposing trends have been observed in this region as well kaiser et al 2014a the same applies to lake water level studied in 32 lakes in an adjacent region in north poland wrzesiński and ptak 2016 these have often been interpreted as deviations from a general regional trend due to local natural or anthropogenic effects germer et al 2011 wrzesiński and ptak 2016 similar inconsistent trends for observation wells close to each other have been reported recently from other regions e g ayers et al 2019 haas and birk 2017 lorenzo lacruz et al 2017 qiao et al 2019 and for other climatological and hydrological observables hamed 2008 lins 2005 pilon and yue 2002 and references therein thus any identification of clear cause effect relationships seems to be a tedious task åkesson et al 2016 in contrast it has been argued that apparent linear trends might rather be part of low frequency oscillations that are characteristic for climatological and hydrological time series as a consequence of frequency dependent damping of input signals it has often been related to the hurst phenomenon persistence scaling behavior etc hurst 1951 koutsoyiannis and montanari 2007 mandelbrot and van ness 1968 although the latter is not a necessary prerequisite for the former it could result in apparently arbitrary monotonic trends even for longer periods irrespective of any clear trend in driving variables koutsoyiannis 2006 in fact numerous studies have found low frequency oscillations of runoff groundwater head and lake water with a period length of some decades gudmundsson et al 2011 garcía molinos et al 2015 neves et al 2016 shun and duffy 1999 that could be confused with montonic trends at shorter time scales in addition low frequency oscillations can differ substantially between adjacent sites garcía molinos et al 2015 it is felt that the implications of these effects are still strongly underestimated in environmental and geo sciences as well as in water resources management koutsoyiannis 2006 2013 to study this in real world data sets local effects need to be systematically factored out this was done by applying a principal component analysis to a set of time series of lake water level and groundwater head in northeast germany covering a 28 years period and partly exhibiting significant trends but with differing signs local effects were subtracted from the observations following the approach by lischeid et al 2010 and hohenbrink et al 2016 the residuals were then analyzed with respect to consistent long term trends compared to that of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration 2 data time series of lake water level and groundwater head were provided from the environmental authorities of the federal states of mecklenburg vorpommern and brandenburg and by the leibniz institute of freshwater ecology and inland fisheries for a region rich in lakes that formed during the last weichselian glaciation kaiser et al 2012 it extends along a 180 km distance from lake müritz about 110 km northwest of berlin to lake schwielochsee 75 km southeast of berlin fig 1 only data from sites without any clear direct anthropogenic impact have been considered except for lake schwielochsee fig 1 in total time series from 23 lakes and 17 groundwater wells for a 40 year period november 1985 to october 2013 were analyzed in this region repeated advances and retreats of inland glaciers during the pleistocene resulted in a complex setting of unconsolidated sediments with high textural heterogeneity mostly of 100 200 m thickness here complex stacked aquifer systems developed partly confined but usually of unknown number and extent of single aquifers e g pöschke et al 2018 where groundwater flow direction can differ between various storeys in addition groundwater flow direction in single aquifers can vary between dry and wet years holzbecher 2001 thus any delineation of watersheds or capture zones is prone to substantial uncertainties correspondingly land use effects can only tentatively be assessed by that of the immediate surroundings table 1 lakes are partly topographically isolated endorheic lakes partly interlinked by streams exorheic lakes the stream network has been substantially extended by man during the last millennium and exhibits numerous weirs kaiser et al 2018 flow velocity in the streams usually is very low due to low relief intensity occasional desiccation has been observed in many streams but has rarely been monitored systematically long term time series of meteorological data at daily intervals were used from five sites in the study region operated by the german weather service fig 1 the region is located in the transition zone between oceanic climate in the northwest and more continental climate in the southeast annual mean temperature is about 9 c annual mean precipitation is between 520 and 550 mm yr 1 and tends to decrease towards southeast 3 methods for statistical analyses and graphs the r software version 3 1 0 r core team 2014 was used 3 1 preprocessing of data application of the principal component analysis to time series of lake water level and groundwater head required synchronous and gap free data sets temporal resolution was once per month at least with mid month readings mostly but not strictly synchronously at different sites thus measured data were linearly interpolated to the 15th day of each month defined as support points this is justified by the pronounced autocorrelation of groundwater head and lake water level data lischeid et al 2010 selection of sites and period aimed at a maximum number of sites and a maximum length with a minimum of data gaps gaps were defined as cases were no observation data were available within a 28 days interval around the mid month support points gap less time series were available for 31 sites seven sites exhibited up to four gaps at three sites major gaps of 11 or 12 months were encountered i e for groundwater well fredersdorf 32 between 15 may 2010 and 01 june 2011 well bergfeld between 15 october 1987 and 15 november 1988 and for lake sprockfitz between 15 october 1985 and 15 november 1986 weekly or daily data were available from some sites these data were synchronized to weekly data as well to be used for power spectrum analysis gaps in meterological time series were filled by regression with data from adjacent sites precipitation was corrected to account for the wind and evaporation error after richter 1995 potential evapotranspiration was assessed as reference crop evapotranspiration according to allen et al 1998 based on air temperature and duration of sunshine data or global radiation modified by wendling 1991 daily climatic water balance was calculated as the difference between precipitation and reference crop evapotranspiration 3 2 significance tests a p 0 05 level of significance was used throughout for significance testing differences between two groups of sampling sites with respect to loadings on principal components were tested using the mann whitney test routine wilcox test r core team 2014 the kendall rank correlation package kendall mcleod 2011 was used to test for monotonic relationships between metrically scaled variables this test gives rather exact assessments of p values for ties none of the two tests requires any specific distribution of the data or homoscedasticity time series were tested for significance of monotonic trends using the mann kendall test kendall 1975 with correction for serial correlation according to yue et al 2002 the magnitude of significant trends was assessed using the approach presented by sen 1968 the analysis was performed using the zyp package bronaugh and werner 2009 in contrast to lake water level and groundwater head trend analysis of the meteorological data was performed for daily rather than monthly data for the november 1985 to october 2013 period due to larger statistical power 3 3 principal component analysis principal component analysis pca performs an eigenvalue decomposition of a covariance matrix of a multivariate data set in order to identify orthogonal principal components defined by the eigenvectors applications of pca on time series of observables that have been measured synchronously at different locations is a common approach in climatology and meteorology where it has been termed the empirical orthogonal functions eof approach jolliffe 2002 vereecken et al 2016 when time series are inputted into the principal component analysis pca the resulting principal components can be regarded as archetypal time series single observed time series can then be represented by linear regression to the principal components pc longuevergne et al 2007 lischeid et al 2010 and lehr et al 2015 give some examples for application on groundwater head data gottschalk 1985 and thomas et al 2012 on discharge data and jawson and niemann 2007 and hohenbrink et al 2016 on soil moisture data in this study the prcomp routine was used r core team 2014 loadings of time series on selected pc lpc1 lpc2 etc that is the pearson correlation coefficient for comparison of single observed time series with selected pc can be used as a quantitative assessment of the respective effect size at single sites jolliffe 2002 due to normalization of the observed time series to unit variance principal components with an eigenvalue exceeding unity reflect effects that necessarily concern more than just a single time series in contrast local effects restricted to single sites are depicted by principal components with much smaller eigenvalues thus to factor out local effects from the observed time series they are projected onto the principal components with eigenvalues exceeding unity projection is performed by multivariate linear regression of the time series with those of the respective principal components details of that approach are given by lehr and lischeid 2020 3 4 spectrum analysis and low pass filtering any discrete time series can be decomposed into a set of sine and cosine functions of different frequencies without any loss of information fourier transformation the sum of squared coefficients of the respective sine and cosine function that is the power is then proportional to the fraction of variance explained by oscillation of the respective frequency plotting power versus frequencies yields a graph of power spectrum density it provides information e g about the weighting of low versus high frequency patterns in the respective time series the fourier transformation is often applied to the autocorrelation function of the time series rather than directly to the genuine time series power spectrum analysis was performed by subjecting the results of autocorrelation analysis routine acf r core team 2014 to the routine spectrum r core team 2014 in order to achieve sufficient frequency resolution it was applied only to data with weekly resolution at least this applied to time series of groundwater head at six sites for the sake of comparability with the groundwater head data readings of the same weekly dates from daily meteorological data and daily data of lake stechlin water level were used for that analysis for the weather station lindenberg fig 1 daily meteorological data for the 01 april 1906 to 31 october 2013 period were used to compile a long term time series of climatic water balance as a proxy of groundwater recharge this time series was subjected to low pass filtering to mimic the proposed low pass filtering of the groundwater recharge signal in a first step a fourier analysis of the time series of n data points x ti at dates ti normalized to zero mean was performed yielding a set of coefficients ak for different frequencies 1 a k 2 n i 1 n x t i e 2 π i k n t i f o r k n 2 1 n 2 low pass filtering was then applied by the inverse fourier transform 2 x t i k n 2 1 n 2 e 2 i k n a k where a k a k a k n 2 b the degree of low pass filtering is adjusted by the coefficient b where b 0 denotes no filtering at all and b 0 denotes strong low pass filtering 4 results 4 1 factoring out local effects by principal component analysis principal component analysis aimed at decomposing the time series of lake water level and groundwater head into a general that is regional and a more specific local part each in a rather conservative approach the general part was assessed via principal components with eigenvalues exceeding unity this holds for the first four principal components that explained 88 53 25 7 and 3 of the variance of the data set except for lake schwielochsee 28 of the variance between 68 and 98 of the variance was explained for each of the remaining sites and more than 80 for 35 out of 40 sites thus local effects including direct anthropogenic effects like groundwater extraction obviously played only a minor role for most of the investigated sites in addition the effect of filling data gaps by linear interpolation seemed to be negligible as the respective sites groundwater wells fredersdorf 32 and bergdorf and lake sprockfitz did not stand out in regard to explained variance 0 93 0 94 and 0 86 respectively fig 2 a shows the loadings of all 40 time series on the 1st and 2nd principal component pc these first two principal components depict 78 of the variance of the data set symbols close to the outer unit circle dashed line indicate time series where most of the variance is depicted by the first two pc like for lake stechlin 89 of variance corresponding to findings in other studies where pca was applied to a set of hydrological time series gottschalk 1985 hohenbrink and lischeid 2015 lehr and lischeid 2020 the 1st pc was similar to a time series of spatial averages of normalized values at all 40 sites for each date of the time series thus it reflected the mean behavior averaged of all sites the second pc has often been found to reflect the degree of transformation of the hydrological input signal in the vadose zone hohenbrink and lischeid 2015 lischeid et al 2010 lehr and lischeid 2020 that is the degree of damping and delaying compared to the precipitation signal in fact this holds for this study as well although with inversed sign time series exhibiting very responsive behavior like water level at lake zeutensee exhibited strong positive correlation with the second pc fig 2 the opposite is true for very smooth time series like groundwater head at well bergfeld fig 2 this degree of transformation can be quantified by a damping coefficient d based on the loadings lpc1 lpc2 on the first and second pc lischeid et al 2010 thus factoring out all other effects 4 d arctan l p c 2 l p c 1 here low negative values denote weak transformation and high positive values strong transformation among all 40 time series that of water level at lake zeutensee exhibited a minimum damping coefficient of d 1 54 and that of groundwater well bergfeld gw a maximum of 1 07 fig 2 for these sites time series are given fig 2b where the effects of additional pcs have been subtracted in general time series with high positive damping coefficients exhibit a more smooth shape correspondingly autocorrelation for lag 1 month is highly significantly correlated with the damping coefficient p 0 001 in addition time series with positive damping coefficients lag behind those with negative damping coefficients accounting to up to three months for single time series compared to that of the lowest damping coefficient fig 2b this study focuses on analysis of inconsistent trends rather than at ascribing principal components to various processes of physical factors thus the third and fourth component are only shortly described here loadings of the time series on the third pc differed significantly p 0 001 between sites with pure forest land cover in up to 1 km distance compared to those of mixed land use exorheic and endorheic lakes differed with respect to loadings on the first and third principal component although on the edge of insignificance p 0 047 in both cases time series of lake water level and groundwater head differed significantly from each other p 0 002 with respect to the fourth component only which comprised 3 of the total variance in addition loadings on that component were significantly correlated with the northings please note that the share of lakes tended to increase towards the north fig 1 although not significantly p 0 08 no significant correlations were found for the first four principal components with respect to eastings altitude of groundwater head or lake water level mean depth to groundwater mean or maximum water depth lake area or lake volume not shown 4 2 trend analysis time series of lake water level and groundwater head were tested for significant monotonic trends for the whole 1985 2013 period on the one hand the genuine time series were directly subjected to the trend analysis on the other hand possible local and direct anthropogenic effects were subtracted thus reducing the variance by 12 on average the latter differed from the unmodified data with respect to the significance of the trend at three out of eleven single sites but hardly in regard to trend size r2 0 998 in either case 11 out of 40 time series 27 5 of all time series exhibited significant trends fig 3 both for the genuine time series as well as for the time series adjusted for local effects significantly increasing trends were found only for time series with low damping coefficients and significantly decreasing trends only for those with high damping coefficients in addition time series of daily precipitation potential evapotranspiration and the climatic water balance as the difference of the two were tested for significant monotonic trends for the same period a significant increase was found only for potential evapotranspiration at one out of five sites and a significant decrease of the climatic water balance at three out of five sites precipitation did not exhibit a significant trend at any of the five weather stations fig 4 however for none of these observables the size of the trend exceeded 0 02 mm yr 1 that is 0 54 mm for the whole 28 year period this is about two orders of magnitude smaller than those of the strongest trends found in lake water level and groundwater head data fig 3 4 3 relating trends to low pass filtering to elucidate the interplay between signal transformation in the vadose zone quantified by the damping coefficient on the one side and monotonic trends on the other side fig 5 presents time series of lake stechlin water level and groundwater head from various observation wells all at 3 5 km distance from the lake land use is forest exclusively for the whole stechlin region table 1 except for some minor settlements and has been so for decades the higher the damping coefficient the more the seasonal pattern was damped and the more low frequency patterns became clear this effect was related to mean depth to groundwater that is the thickness of the vadose zone in addition long term trends inverse all time series in the upper row of panels of fig 5 a d with d 0 exhibited a significant increase and the two time series in the lower panel e f with d 0 a significant decrease during the 1985 2013 period the set of time series clearly reflects a successive transformation with increasing damping coefficient rather than systematic differences between time series with increasing or decreasing trend respectively it has been argued that damping of the hydrological signal in the soil can be described as a low pass filtering process then the slope of the power spectrum can be used as a measure to quantify the latter the slope of the power spectrum of time series of precipitation is close to zero indicating approximately the same share of variance in the high frequency range compared to the low frequency range fig 6 in contrast the power spectrum of potential evapotranspiration decreases towards the higher frequencies right side of the bottom right graph indicating less variance in the high frequency range the slope of the power spectrum of the time series of the climatic water balance as the difference between these two variables exhibits an intermediate slope in contrast the power spectrum of lake water level and groundwater head fig 6 shows a much stronger decline towards the high frequencies this is equivalent to the frequency dependent damping of sound in air or in solid materials attenuation of high frequencies is much stronger compared to that of low frequencies consequently sound becomes duller during transmission through air harris 1966 international organization for standardization 1993 or through a concrete wall the same applies to hydrological signals that propagate as pressure waves in the subsurface to check whether the observed trends on groundwater head and lake water level could be ascribed to low pass filtering of a climate signal without any clear trend a long time series of climatic water balance data was subjected to different degrees of low pass filtering the time series of climatic water balance was calculated for daily meteorological data of the lindenberg weather station fig 1 covering the 01 april 1906 to 31 october 2013 period a high degree of low pass filtering did not only yield very smooth time series but also a clear negative trend during the last decades as part of a low frequency pattern fig 7 similar to that observed at some groundwater wells with high damping coefficient cf fig 5 lower row however the increasing trend observed at other sites cf fig 5 upper row could not be reproduced not shown 5 discussion this study aims at testing two competing hypotheses to explain inconsistent trends observed in 28 year time series of lake water level and groundwater head in northeast germany the first hypothesis ascribes inconsistent trends to local that is presumably anthropogenic effects at single sites to that end local effects were factored out using principal component analysis the second hypothesis states that low frequency patterns in meteorological driver variables are masked by high frequency patterns the latter are increasingly stripped off during passage of the hydrological signal through the vadose zone consequently low frequency patterns become increasingly more clear when the period length of prevailing frequencies is at least roughly double the length of the study period the visible range of that pattern might be mistaken as a continuous trend 5 1 inconsistent trends trend analysis is easy to perform and thus has often been used to check for climate change effects or anthropogenic effects in environmental data the term trend analysis usually is used in a rather narrow sense for testing for a linear or monotonic trend of the mean value of a time series the basic assumption is often that significant trends at the scale of years or decades would indicate major changes previous work in the study region gave clear evidence for substantial oscillations of lake water level at the scale of decades kaiser et al 2015 up to millennia dietze et al 2016 kaiser et al 2014b corresponding results have been reported from a similar region in poland by starkel et al 1996 from southern central europe by magny 2004 and from ireland by garcía molinos et al 2015 likewise todhunter and fietzek devries 2016 found evidence for substantial multi decadal and centennial oscillations of the water level of the devils lake north dakota usa during the last 4000 years that they ascribed to the dynamics of hydroclimatic forcing including the catastrophic flooding during the last two decades gudmundsson et al 2011 describe low frequency patterns for runoff data from numerous catchments all over europe and clarke 2007 for south america thus results of the analysis of linear or monotonic trends are necessarily restricted to limited time periods however that does not explain why trends of the same observable but at different sites usually differ not only in strength but even in sign not only monotonic trends but even the degree of low frequency oscillations can differ substantially between adjacent sites at the scale of decades garcía molinos et al 2015 or of centuries to millennia as indicated by rather poor correlation between palaeo records of lake water level within a small region starkel et al 1996 5 2 first hypothesis inconsistent trends are due to local peculiarities trends of lake water level and groundwater head were not closely related to those of climatological variables firstly trends in the driving meteorological variables as far as they were significant were very small and unlikely to result in the observed major differences between sites fig 4 secondly these trends could not explain trends of lake water level and groundwater head with opposing signs within a few km distance fig 3 thirdly the maximum time shift between corresponding peaks in time series exhibiting different damping coefficients was three months fig 2 a temporal delay that short could not explain the observed inconsistent trends e g groundwater head at some sites responding to climatological input of preceding decades and others to more recent input please note that this holds for the pressure signal only and must not be mismatched with groundwater age dating data principal components exceeding an eigenvalue of one were considered indicative for non local effects on lake water level and groundwater head thus more than two third of the variance at all sites could be ascribed to regional rather than local effects except for lake schwielochsee fig 2 here up to 75 of the variance had to be ascribed to local effects the river spree runs through the lake which discharges a region with massive open cast mining and corresponding extensive dewatering grünewald 2001 schoenheinz et al 2011 however even at this site natural processes added onto the observed dynamics rather than substituting them the principal component analysis allowed extracting the respective pieces of information that were related to natural processes cf hohenbrink et al 2016 lehr and lischeid 2020 for the remaining sites possible local effects were substantially smaller but could not fully be ruled out in contrast to common assumptions however neither direct anthropogenic effects nor land use or systematic differences between groundwater head and lake water level or between exorheic and endorheic lakes seemed to have played a major role in this data set factoring out local effects had only minor effects on sign and strength of monotonic trends figs 3 and 5 even more important the correlation between trends and damping effects was hardly modified fig 5 thus inconsistent trends of lake water level and groundwater head could not be ascribed to local effects instead there was a systematic shift from time series with low damping coefficient often exhibiting a significant long term increase to time series with high damping coefficient partly exhibiting a significant decrease similar observations are reported from other studies although without establishing a causal connection van der maaten et al 2015 found significantly decreasing lake water levels in two out of three studied lakes in this region for the 1988 2010 period the third lake did not exhibit any trend but a much more pronounced seasonal pattern pointing to much less damping of the input signal pathak and dodamani 2019 investigated groundwater level trends in 59 wells in the ghataprabha river basin in southwest india the data set was divided into three clusters that reflected different degrees of short term oscillations decreasing trends were detected in 81 of the wells in the cluster of least fluctuating groundwater heads but substantially less in the other two clusters with more responsive time series in addition some wells even exhibited opposing trends in the latter two clusters dong et al 2019 report on slight rising trends in shallow groundwater in contrast to distinctive declining trends in deep groundwater in a set of 575 wells in the mid atlantic region of the united states they ascribe these differences to the delayed response of the deep groundwater to changes of precipitation in our study though maximal delay time between different wells did not exceed three months which could not explain opposing trends in our 28 year data set cf fig 5 5 3 second hypothesis inconsistent trends result from a misconception of low pass filtering processes it has been argued that frequency dependent damping of input signals could explain patterns of inconsistent trends in hydrological time series according to that apparent long term monotonic trends can evolve from very low frequency oscillations with period lengths of decades centuries or even longer cohn and lins 2005 hamed 2008 lins and cohn 2011 low frequency oscillations are already part of the meteorological input signal bordi et al 2009 but are masked by much stronger high frequency patterns and become visible only when the latter are increasingly more attenuated this so called low pass filtering is a typical feature of dissipative processes like heat dispersion in water bodies cyr and cyr 2003 seepage fluxes gudmundsson et al 2011 katul et al 2007 shun and duffy 1999 and solute transport gall et al 2013 kirchner et al 2010 in the vadose zone and water transport kleidon et al 2013 in catchments in either case the energy of the input signal dissipates resulting in a delay and in a damping of amplitudes with increasing strength of damping that is increasing attenuation of high frequency patterns even more lower frequency patterns become visible katul et al 2007 in this study it was by chance only that different trends with opposing signs showed up for different degrees of damping in general probability of a significant trend increases systematically with increasing smoothness of the time series that is at sites with high damping factors often the slope of the power spectrum has been used to quantify the degree of damping of the input signal in the vadose zone katul et al 2007 kirchner et al 2010 neves et al 2016 like in this study other measures have been used as well e g gall et al 2013 hohenbrink and lischeid 2015 showed that the damping behavior could be described by the first two components of a principal component analysis of the respective set of time series of soil moisture in fact the differing degrees of damping of the input signal observed in time series of groundwater head can be traced back to vadose zone processes lischeid et al 2017a 2017b this is confirmed e g by shun and duffy 1999 who studied low frequency oscillations in precipitation temperature and runoff at various sites within a mountainous catchment along an elevation gradient they found increasingly more pronounced low frequency oscillations at lower elevation that they ascribe to decreasing suppression of high frequency patterns that prevail in the meteorological input data correspondingly increasing persistence in hydrological time series has been related recently to properties which likely reflect a higher degree of damping of the hydrological input signal e g catchment size dey and mujumdar 2018 markonis et al 2018 the ratio of pervious over impervious areas in the catchment jovanovic et al 2018 or higher persistence in speleothem compared to tree ring based paleoclimatic records iliopoulou et al 2018 in order to check whether the observed low frequency patterns of groundwater head dynamics could be ascribed to low pass filtering of a climate signal the climatic water balance was taken as a proxy for groundwater recharge the time series of the climatic water balance did neither exhibit a significant trend nor any dominant frequency fig 7 in spite of that pronounced low pass filtering of that signal resulted in a low frequency pattern that resembled that observed in some of the groundwater observation wells with high damping coefficients fig 7 cf fig 5 thus supporting the hypothesis correspondingly e g boutt 2016 reported on significant either positive or negative 40 years trends in 12 of the studied precipitation stations and stream gauges but in 60 of the observation wells in the same region in new england usa with 75 73 and 83 spatial replicates each to summarize climate and hydrological time series exhibit random fluctuation at different scales national research council 1991 koutsoyiannis 2002 which should not be confused with instationarity of the underlying processes montanari and koutsoyiannis 2014 koutsoyiannis and montanari 2015 trend analysis is sensitive to low frequency patterns that become visible only when the high frequency part is stripped off the low pass filtering applied in this study does not consider time lags thus the low pass filtered time series run ahead of the actually observed time series of groundwater head more severely long term trends observed at other wells with less strong damping could not be reproduced this might be due to various reasons first of all the climatic water balance is only a crude approximation of the true groundwater recharge it does neither consider higher evapotranspiration of larger plants compared to short cut grass nor reduction of evapotranspiration after crop harvesting grassland harvesting or grazing or due to limited water availability e g at the end of the growing season secondly the power spectrum of measured groundwater head and lake water level fig 6 exhibits more scatter compared to those of the low pass filtering exercise fig 7 both effects likely play a major role especially in the higher frequency range that is for less strongly damped time series consequently the behavior effects could not be mimicked for these sites the resulting phenomenon of significant trends arising apparently out of nothing is closely related to the concept of stochastic resonance it means that in non linear systems a noisy input pattern might amplify system inherent weak periodicities thus exceeding a crucial threshold and pushing the system to a new state nicolis 1982 and benzi et al 1982 introduced the concept of stochastic resonance as a potential trigger mechanism for the glaciation cycles during the pleistocene the concept has since then been extended and has been applied to numerous non linear systems in various scientific disciplines including e g neurophysiology or quantum physics gammaitoni et al 1998 however the notion of noise needs to be reconsidered in environmental sciences this term is often used according to the concept in radio technology where the signal is provided by the low frequency part of an electromagnetic wave and high frequency noise adds to that due to technological imperfections correspondingly environmental scientists tend to consider the low frequency part the signal to be separated from high frequency noise however in case of hydrological processes meteorological variables impose a high frequency signal from which low frequency patterns at greater depth evolve due to progressive attenuation of the high frequency part of the input signal thus the role of high frequency and low frequency patterns is rather inverse to the common perception in environmental sciences 6 conclusions inconsistent trends were found in 28 year time series of lake water level and groundwater head at 40 sites in northeast germany even when local effects had been factored out instead we found strong evidence for the decisive role of low pass filtering of hydrological input signals in this regard we observed that during passage of infiltrated water through the vadose zone the hydrological input signal became increasingly more damped in addition to a certain time delay damping occured as a low pass filtering of the input signal thus minor high frequency oscillations in the climatological time series became increasingly more attenuated and the inherent low frequency patterns became increasingly more clear resulting in apparent monotonic trends for limited time periods strength and sign of these trends was closely related to the degree of low pass filtering of the hydrological input signal in the vadose zone which differed substantially even between adjacent sites oscillations occuring at all time scales have often been observed in climatological and hydrological time series and have been ascribed to persistence bordi et al 2009 garcía molinos et al 2015 koutsoyiannis 2006 lins and cohn 2011 however diagnosis of persistence in practice often yields unstable results due to restricted length of the available time series bordi et al 2009 hodgkins et al 2017 koutsoyiannis 2013 but persistence is not a necessary prerequisite for frequency dependent damping of input signals this study has shown that the latter clearly needs to be taken into account in trend analysis studies for scenario analyses of long term changes usually clear trends or stepwise changes are imposed on model input data to study the system s response inversely it is often argued that hydrological response cannot exhibit any clear trend without a corresponding clear trend of the driving data this study provides some examples that this does not necessarily hold true hydrological modelling as well as many field studies rarely account for frequency dependent damping in spite of clear theoretical evidence koutsoyiannis 2013 whereas this might be reasonable for short term dynamics it obviously falls short when long term trends are studied we conclude that trend analysis turns out to be anything but easy to apply and easy to understand rather identifying major changes in a world of permanent changes remains a major scientific challenge presence or absence of clear trends in groundwater head or lake water level time series does not necessarily confirm or disprove a major system shift correspondingly our results do neither imply that climate change does not occur nor that climate change would not affect hydrological processes rather they point to the fact that climate change or direct anthropogenic effects are much more difficult to identify in real world data sets than widely presumed cf natkhin et al 2012 correspondingly the recommendation using trend analysis to test for possible direct anthropogenic effects on groundwater quantity in regards to the european water framework directive clearly is at odds with some fundamental features of hydrological systems behavior credit authorship contribution statement gunnar lischeid conceptualization methodology software

4714,this paper investigates the effectiveness of different oscillatory hydraulic tomography oht frequencies for estimating heterogeneous fields the analysis first formulates the effects of uncharacterized aquifer responses t and s fields as the ensemble mean residual flux and residual storage terms in the stochastic unconditional and conditional mean equations these terms persist unless the t s or head fields are specified everywhere we then conducted oht to estimate the t and s fields using monte carlo experiments the experiments show that using the heads in response to periodic pumping with different frequencies or multifrequency the estimates performance metrics vary from one realization to others the mean performance metrics over many realizations are however indistinguishable despite the frequency we attribute the variation in the performance metrics to the lack of parameter or state variable ergodicity lastly we emphasize the importance of dense monitoring networks and a cost effective data collection strategy to improve the resolution of characterizing aquifer heterogeneity 1 introduction conventionally transmissivity t and storage coefficient s are estimated using a constant rate pumping or injection test and methods of analysis such as thiem 1906 theis 1935 or cooper and jacob 1946 periodic pumping tests ppt hydraulic tests with periodically varying pumping rates have also been proposed to estimate these properties for example black and kipp 1981 developed methods for estimating diffusivity based on analytical solutions in terms of the pressure attenuation and the phase lag during a sinusoidal point or line excitations they concluded that the methods are not a substitute for conventional aquifer testing due to time and equipment costs still they are a useful tool to apply in specific applications butler and mcelwee 1990 examined the head s sensitivity at pumping well to different known t values at 6 zones concentrically circling the well a 1 d radial flow they stated that variations in the pumping rate increase the drawdown s sensitivities to each layer s property without estimating the property they concluded that the estimate s uncertainty could be reduced rasmussen et al 2003 and renner and messar 2006 applied the ppt to field aquifers they found that the estimated properties were hydraulic properties averaged over different volumes of heterogeneous subsurface and consistent with conventional aquifer tests they emphasized that the approach minimizes investigation derived wastes e g contaminated groundwater and introduces a signal different from background perturbations easy to detect with small scale soil column experiments song and renner 2008 reported that the pressure analysis yields a relatively constant permeability for the high porosity sample at different pressures and oscillation periods they found slightly period dependent permeability for the low porosity samples and the stacked sample the period dependence diminishes with increasing period rabinovich et al 2013 theoretically investigated heterogeneous aquifers effective conductivity in unsteady periodic flow by a stochastic approach they concluded that the effective conductivity and the ensemble mean head and flux have significant dynamic effects on the other hand guiltinan and becker 2015 used constant rate pumping tests and periodic slug tests to detect wells hydraulic connectivity in fractured bedrock at a field site they neglected early time drawdown behaviors and analyzed the effective hydraulic diffusivity by fitting the late time drawdown to theis curve based on homogeneous aquifers they suggested that the periodic tests estimated field is more sensitive to the hydraulic connectivity among well pairs than those from the constant rate pumping test the value of estimated hydraulic diffusivity from the periodic tests approaches that of the constant rate test as the oscillation frequency decreases similarly the usefulness of periodic pumping has also been investigated by fischer et al 2018 schuite et al 2017 and lavenue and demarsily 2001 for the karstic and fractured aquifer characterization by sun et al 2015 and sun et al 2017 for leakage detection and by rabinovich et al 2015 for imaging unconfined aquifer ahn and horne 2010 developed analytical solutions for attenuation and phase shift of pressure pulse testing in a 1 d radial flow through 3 concentric layers of different permeability with 10 unknown permeability blocks surrounding the test well they reported that the attenuation and phase shift provided an indicator characteristic to reveal reservoir heterogeneity likewise based on numerical experiments cardiff et al 2013 reported that including head data from pumping with different frequencies can improve the aquifer hydraulic parameter estimates even if the pumping is only conducted in one pumping well on the other hand hydraulic tomography ht with constant pumping rates has been proposed as a new aquifer characterization method yeh and liu 2000 zhu and yeh 2005 it has been proven over the past two decades as a matured technology for high resolution characterization of saturated and variably saturated porous media e g cardiff and barrash 2011 mao et al 2013b berg and illman 2011 2015 zhao and illman 2018 and fractured rocks at fields and laboratories illman et al 2009 zha et al 2016 further theoretical and physical explanations of the robustness of tomographic surveys have been provided by wen et al 2019 sun et al 2013 huang et al 2011 and yeh et al 2014 recently zhou et al 2016 reported that head collected from oscillatory hydraulic tomography oht with multifrequency excitations provides better estimates than those from single frequency excitations when the number of pumping tests and observation locations is limited on the contrary results of the monte carlo experiment of aquifer characterization using river stage variation with different frequencies by wang et al 2019 signify that the estimated t field s ensemble averaged performance is independent of frequency they implied that previously reported improvements of estimates using different frequencies based on one realization of heterogeneity are not warranted for all possible realizations however the river stage tomography is not the same as oht and wang et al 2019 only investigated the effect of different single frequencies and did not evaluate the performance of river stage variations of multifrequency this paper aims to explain that neglecting heterogeneity introduces the frequency and scenario dependence estimated parameters more importantly this paper demonstrates that excitations of multifrequency do not overcome difficulties associated with the under determined nature of the inverse problems and do not necessarily improve the heterogeneity estimates finally the importance of considering flow ergodicity issues for evaluating the robustness of inverse models is stressed 2 groundwater flow model this study assumes that the following equations describe 2 d plan view groundwater flow induced by periodic pumping at a well during oht in a heterogeneous confined aquifer 1 t x h x t s x h x t t q t δ x x p where h represents the head responses l t is transmissivity l2 t s is storage coefficient x is the vector in and y directions δ is dirac delta function x p denotes the coordinate of pumping well and t represents time t the periodic pumping rate with a given amplitude q 0 is expressed as 2 q t q 0 exp 2 π i ω t in which ω is the frequency cycle t and i is the imaginary unit the positive pumping rate represents extraction the piezometric head s initial condition is uniform and the boundary condition can be prescribed head or flux boundaries expressing the above equations in the frequency domain leads to 3 t x ϕ i ω s x ϕ q 0 where ϕ is the phasor l which is a complex variable containing the information of head amplitude and phase lag the boundary condition can be prescribed phasor or flux boundaries 3 stochastic analysis of ppt in heterogeneous aquifers investigation of the effects of oht on the estimated t and s in aquifers is most appropriate to formulate the problem in a stochastic framework and consider the periodic pumping at a single well first since t x and s x are spatially varying and they are difficult to determine at every location of the aquifer the stochastic analysis conceptualizes t and s as random fields which can be expressed as 4 t x t t x and s x s s x where t and s are unconditional means which are invariant in space and ensemble note that the overhead bar stands for the expected value t x the unconditional perturbations at each x are characterized by their unconditional covariance functions which are assumed to be exponential these covariance functions specify the spatial variance i e the perturbations uncertainty and the spatial relationship between perturbations in the ensemble sense accordingly many possible ϕ x ω fields exist in this aquifer in response to an oscillatory pumping test with a given q0 at a frequency ω these fields are thus considered as a random field and can be expressed by 5 ϕ x ω ϕ x ω ϕ x ω in which ϕ x ω is the unconditional ensemble mean and ϕ x ω is the perturbation at x with a frequency ω substituting eqs 4 and 5 into eq 3 we have 6 t t x ϕ x ω ϕ x ω i ω s s x ϕ x ω ϕ x ω q 0 instead of all possible ϕ x fields induced by the pumping with a given frequency we seek the most likely unconditional mean of ϕ x thus we take the expected value of eq 6 and we have the following 7 e t e s e ϕ 0 and e t x ϕ x ω e t x ϕ x ω note that perturbation expectation is zero and the dominated convergence theorem is lim x 0 f f f is any function substituting eqs 7 into eq 6 we have 8 t ϕ t ϕ i ω s ϕ i ω s ϕ q 0 where again the overhead bar denotes the expected value or ensemble average notice that the x ω for ϕ and x for t and s are dropped hereafter this equation is called the ensemble unconditional mean flow equation it describes ϕ field the most likely ϕ field in responses to an oscillatory pumping test with a given frequency this ensemble mean equation shows that the unconditional t s and ϕ alone do not satisfy the mass balance equation unless two additional terms are included one of the terms t ϕ or the ensemble unconditional mean residual flux e g neuman and orr 1993 guadagnini and neuman 1999 is the unconditional cross covariance of variations between ϕ and t the other term s ϕ is the ensemble unconditional mean residual storage or the cross covariance of variations between s and ϕ these two terms represent the contributions of unknown perturbations t s and ϕ to the mean flow equation gelhar 1986 3 1 unconditional and conditional effective approaches next we examine the impacts of t ϕ and s ϕ in stochastic modeling approaches on the unconditional or conditional estimates of t and s fields which yield the most likely unconditional or conditional ϕ field i e ensemble mean field 3 1 1 unconditional approach suppose t x and s x of the aquifer are entirely unknown and we adopt the equivalent homogeneous media ehm model to predict the unconditional ensemble mean of ϕ then eq 8 can be rewritten as 9 t eff 2 ϕ i ω s eff ϕ q 0 in which t eff t t ϕ 2 ϕ 1 and s eff s s ϕ ϕ 1 are the unconditional effective parameters here the effective parameters are assumed to be invariant in ensemble and space while some theoretical analyses e g indelman 2003 showed that they might vary with radial distance near the pumping well and then approach some constant values at large radial distances tartakovsky and neuman 1998 investigated the effect of temporal nonlocality on one and three dimensional mean flows in infinite statistically homogeneous media rabinovich et al 2013 found that the unconditional effective t derived from the periodic pumping test is frequency dependent and varying with the variance of t this means that additional term i e t ϕ 2 ϕ 1 in the effective parameter varies with the frequency of pumping rates these effective parameters yield the most likely averaged ϕ field over all possible heterogeneity the unconditional ϕ field under the given periodic pumping discharge the deviation from its unconditional mean ϕ the uncertainty and spatial variability of ϕ at any location is quantified by the unconditional variance ϕ the application of the effective parameters to a field condition requires the ergodicity assumption that is this unconditional mean field ϕ in an aquifer should reproduce the general pattern of observed ϕ values in the least squared sense but does not honor the observed ϕ value at each observation location see wu et al 2005 yeh et al 2015a 3 1 2 conditional approach the conditional approach adopts the highly parameterized conceptual model and requires that the conditional t s and mean ϕ fields reproduce measured t s and ϕ values at the sampling locations yeh et al 1996 three possible conditional scenarios are discussed below scenario a if t x and s x at every location are given precisely without any uncertainty eq 8 reduces to 10 t c x ϕ c i ω s c x ϕ c q 0 the subscript c denotes conditional and the overhead bar again represents the expectation in this case the conditional mean fields are identical to the given realization i e t c x t x and s c x s x since t and s are fully specified the exact ϕ is equal to the fully conditioned mean head field ϕ c and can be solved uniquely with the given initial and boundary conditions notice that t ϕ and s ϕ vanish in this equation scenario b this scenario represents the case where the ϕ value at every location is known precisely but t and s fields are entirely unknown under this circumstance the following conditioned mean flow equation depicts the ϕ fields t t ϕ c i ω s s ϕ c q 0 or 11 t ϕ c i ω s ϕ c t ϕ c i ω s ϕ c q 0 notice that ϕ c is a fully conditioned mean or the true ϕ field with zero variance i e uncertainty t and s are unconditional mean values which are known and constant in space and the ensemble while t and s are unknown perturbations in eq 11 the first two terms are the known net flux at each location resulting from the known t and s and the known ϕ c the second two terms denote the unknown net flux and storage perturbations at each location due to the unknown t and s and the known ϕ c field although t ϕ and s ϕ disappear in eq 11 estimation of t and s remains an under determined inverse problem due to the unknown spatial distribution of the flux induced by q 0 that is many possible t and s pairs lead to the same head field unless t and s or the spatial distribution of flux along the boundaries are specified mao et al 2013a yeh et al 2015a 2015b because all the variables associated with frequency ω i e the first two terms in eq 11 ϕ c ω and q o are specified the system of equations to be solved is independent of frequency and so are the estimated t and s scenario c suppose ϕ t and s are known exactly at some not all locations in the aquifer the terms t ϕ and s ϕ in eq 8 are zero at locations where t and s are specified and at others are non zero the residual head variances likewise are zero at locations where heads are known but the residual t and s variances at these head locations are non zero although they become small e g p 286 in cheng et al 2019 therefore the ensemble mean equation becomes 12 t effc x ϕ c i ω s effc x ϕ c q 0 t effc x and s effc x are the conditional effective parameters which honor the sample values at the sample locations these parameters under the given flow conditions yield the conditional mean head fields ϕ c that reproduce the observed heads at the observation wells yeh et al 1996 these effective parameters are the sum of their unconditional means i e t and s and the contributions from the non zero t ϕ and s ϕ terms after conditioning with sparse measurements of ϕ t and s since the variable ϕ ingrained in these non zero terms vary with the frequency the conditional effective parameters are frequency dependent because of the frequency dependent nature of the conditional effective parameters some studies as discussed in the introduction found that a pumping test with a multifrequency rate could lead to a more detailed characterization of the heterogeneity than that with a constant rate or single frequency the expectation nature of the two non zero terms conditional cross covariance in the conditional mean flow equation may explain these findings as we have remarked in scenarios a and b these terms become small or vanish only if t s or ϕ are specified at some locations that is without adding additional observation wells or parameter measurements manipulating pumping rates with different frequencies does not remove these cross covariance terms but changes their patterns as reflected in the sensitivity maps in figs 6 and 7 of cardiff et al 2013 nevertheless these terms are still ensemble averaged relationships between many possible t s and ϕ fields that is many combinations of these fields can lead to the same cross covariance pattern during the inverse modeling using data from multifrequency pumping rates these cross covariance terms remain unresolved and many possible solutions exist the previous studies claiming improvements in the estimates are likely due to the simple heterogeneity pattern considered in their studies e g ahn and horne 2010 which only have a limited number of possibilities consequently adding additional frequency information may lead the estimates to a similar but not exact heterogeneous pattern as the number of the unknowns becomes large and the pattern becomes complex the possibility of obtaining a close estimate by using a multifrequency would be as slight as using single frequency data 4 conditional effective parameter estimator simsle to substantiate our points in section 3 1 2 scenario c we use a conditional effective parameter estimator to conduct numerical experiments in section 5 the simsle simultaneous successive linear estimator xiang et al 2009 is an extension of sle successive linear estimator yeh et al 1995 1996 they are parameter estimation algorithms built upon the stochastic conditional expectation concept priestley 1979 and the hydrogeology cokriging concept kitanidis and vomvoris 1983 dagan 1985 the algorithm also considers the nonlinear relationship between the state variable e g water level and the parameters kitanidis 1995 yeh et al 1995 in summary it is a stochastic nonlinear estimator that derives the conditional effective parameter fields with given locally measured parameter values and observed heads and yields conditional mean and covariance of head fields as discussed in the section 3 1 2 scenario c and gao et al 2021 recognizing the non redundant information collected by tomographic surveys as elucidated in wen et al 2019 yeh and liu 2000 developed the 3 d steady state hydraulic tomography and zhu and yeh 2005 built the 3 d transient hydraulic tomography based on the sle to further estimate the conditional effective parameters over the past two decades simsle has become a mature inverse model for hydraulic tomography in heterogeneous porous media as well as fractured rocks recently cheng et al 2019 proposed a linear cokriging technique for oscillatory hydraulic tomography a detailed description of simsle is available in many publications below is a brief description of the algorithm for this study mathematically simsle is similar to the kalman filter developed for time domain stochastic processes it iteratively determines the conditional effective parameter fields t eff x and s eff x in section 3 1 2 scenario c using the linear estimator 13 f r 1 f r ε ff r j fh r j fh r t ε ff r j fh r μ θ 1 h h r in which f r is an m 1 vector m is the total

head information is included albeit the residual variance is an approximation a small value indicates that the estimated effective lnt or lns likely is close to the true fields a large value indicates the uncertainty is not resolved again this uncertainty is an ensemble statistic and is not equal to the actual difference between the true and estimate the iterative update is terminated if the mean squared error of simulated and observed heads is smaller than a specified tolerance e g 10 7 or the increase of the spatial variance of the estimated parameter becomes insignificant between successive iterations that is the algorithm is unable to extract further heterogeneity information contained in the observed heads 5 monte carlo numerical experiments oht attempts to solve the under determined inverse problems scenario c with conditioning only on the head which have many possible solutions utilizing heads induced by excitations with different frequencies for inverse modeling may result in accidentally superior or poor estimates monte carlo mc experiments therefore are necessary to verify the oht s reliability the simulation domain of the mc experiments is a 2 d horizontal confined aquifer consisting of 40 40 square elements each element is 30 m 30 m the aquifer is bounded by a constant head boundary of 30 m the initial head is 30 m everywhere in this experiment we solve the time domain governing flow equations eqs 1 and 2 and use 32 time steps to represent a single periodic cycle to ensure the results accuracy two hundred realizations of random fields with given means of t and s 0 01 m2 min and 10 5 variances of lnt and lns 2 and 0 5 and correlation lengths λ x λ y 400 m are generated using a spectral method gutjahr 1989 robin et al 1993 nine wells are installed in the aquifer circles in fig 1 an oht using four pumping wells square in fig 1 with periodic pumping rates of four periods ω 1 15 20 50 and 100 min cycle is used in each realization that is each realization includes 16 individual pumping tests 4 frequencies times 4 pumping wells afterward the simulated head responses 32 timesteps of the last cycle at monitoring wells after the flow reaches quasi steady are utilized for the inversion this analysis is conducted in the time domain the analysis based on the frequency domain is presented in the later section the prior information for simsle consists of the same means variances and correlation lengths as those used to generate the random field we use the same geostatistical parameters as the generated random fields to focus on different pumping frequencies effects on the estimate the computation is implemented in a variably saturated flow finite element model vsaft2 yeh et al 1993 available at http tian hwr arizona edu downloads to estimate t and s with observed heads under different frequencies and multifrequency we use the coefficient of determination r2 and the mean squared error l2 norm as the performance metrics to evaluate each realization s estimates t estimates fig 2a displays the mean and standard deviation of r2 and l2 between the reference and estimated t fields resulting from 200 realizations based on different single frequencies and those of the combination of all frequencies the left side axis of the plot is for r2 and the right side axis is for l2 as displayed in the figure large standard deviations of r2 for different frequencies suggest that the oht survey s performance could vary significantly from one realization to another interestingly the mean and standard deviation of r2 and l2 of the 200 realizations are almost identical despite the frequency ω in the multifrequency case the mean r2 is 0 66 with a standard deviation of 0 11 the mean l2 is 0 030 with a standard deviation of 0 016 these values are similar to those cases with a single frequency this result indicates that using multiple frequencies in oht does not improve the estimates averaged over the 200 realizations s estimates performance metrics of estimated s fields in fig 2b show that the mean and standard deviation of r2 and l2 are nearly identical regardless of the pumping rate frequency oht using the multifrequency yields 0 57 for the mean r2 with 0 12 for the standard deviation the mean l2 is 2 6 10 5 and the standard deviation is 6 9 10 6 again using the multifrequency in oht does not improve the s estimates a two sided t test to further support our conclusion above we carry out a two sided t test with 95 confidence interval to certify if the difference in mean values between the multiple and single frequencies is significant or not table 1 lists the t values corresponding to the results in fig 2a and b if the t value is greater than 1 97 or less than 1 97 the difference is significant in the table the values labeled by indicate the difference is significant i e the multifrequency improves the estimate the values without indicate the difference is not significant i e the multifrequency does not improve the estimate the t values of l2 and r in table 1 show that t s estimate from multifrequency data does not significantly differ from those from the single frequency in contrast the estimate of s may slightly differ from those from the single frequency number of realizations a sufficient number of realizations is a must to ensure the representativeness of mc experiment s results fig 3a and b show the means and standard deviations of r2 and l2 as a function of the number of realizations they confirm that 200 realizations are sufficiently large to support our findings in other words the mc results certify that in many trials manipulating pumping frequency does not reduce the conditional residual flux t ϕ and residual storage s ϕ as indicated by the nearly constant means and large standard deviations of r2 and l2 in fig 2 specifically had the estimates been improved close to the correct field the residual flux and storage terms should have diminished so should the means and standard deviations as discussed in section 3 1 2 we emphasize that additional non redundant information from additional pumping or observation wells wen et al 2019 wang et al 2019 guarantees the estimate s improvement 6 single realization we also present the results based on a single realization below the reference t and s fields and the wells for this case are displayed in fig 4a and b estimated t the estimated t fields using the oht with the pumping rate of the periods 15 20 50 100 and the combination of all the periods are displayed in fig 5a b c d and e respectively in fig 5f g h i and j we show the scatter plots of the reference field against the estimated based on oht with different periods also included in these figures are the regression lines slope and intercept the correlation between the estimated and reference lnt r2 and the mean squared error of lnt l2 according to these figures oht using different single or multifrequency excitations captures the general pattern of heterogeneity excitations of different frequencies improve the estimates at some locations and worsen them at others there is no clear winner or loser for characterizing the detailed parameter variations intuitively a low frequency long period excitation could cover a greater area than the high frequencies high frequency short period excitations could map details near the well field consequently a multifrequency a mixture of different periods excitation combining various frequencies merits could improve the overall estimate nevertheless the scatter plots of this realization suggest otherwise in particular the slope intercept r2 and l2 values indicate that the estimate based on a period of 15 a high frequency is least satisfactory and based on a period of 20 is the best the scatter plots also indicate that the estimate based on all frequencies multifrequency fig 5j is worse than that in fig 5i based on a long period of 100 a low frequency the results of this realization contradict the intuition however they corroborate the large standard deviations in r2 and l2 values in fig 2 they further demand mc experiments to assess the reliability of the oht estimates for ill defined inverse problems estimated s plots similar to those in fig 5 are presented in fig 6 a through j for s estimates akin to the results in fig 5 ohts with different frequencies create different local scale anomalies but derive a similar general spatial distribution fig 6f shows that excitation with a period of 15 yields the least acceptable estimate the slope intercept r2 and l2 values in fig 6j from multifrequency excitation are superior to those with different single frequencies these results seem to follow our intuition but contradict the previous findings based on the t estimates this contradiction may be because t and s behave differently and interact with each other such conflicting t and s estimates behaviors highlight the uncertainty in results from oht with excitations of different frequencies in a single realization the mc simulations thus are deemed to be appropriate 7 effects of domain size and time domain solution to show that the results in the above examples are independent of the domain size the correlation scale and the solution technique i e time or frequency domain solution we present an additional mc example solved by the frequency domain equations eq 3 the new aquifer is 98 m 98 m consisting of 70 70 rectangular elements the grid spacing varies as shown in fig 7 the oht uses nine wells fig 7 and the horizontal and vertical spacings between the two wells are 5 m the spacing is 9 times smaller than the size of the entire domain the width of the element is 0 5 m near the well and 2 m in the remote region a zero amplitude boundary bounds the aquifer for this mc simulation six hundred realizations of a random t field with a mean of t 10 4 m2 s and a variance of 1 in lnt and correlation lengths are λ x λ y 5 m the s field is homogeneous with a value of 10 4 as in previous oht analyses by others the oht surveys employ three sequential pumping tests at three wells square in fig 7 with periodic pumping rates of four periods ω 1 400 1600 3600 and 10800 s cycle as a result 12 individual pumping tests 4 frequencies times 3 pumping wells are conducted for each realization the numerical accuracy limits the selection of the lower periods the radius of influence corresponding to each period is 20 40 60 and 104 m based on the formula i e the distance of signal propagation is proportional to t s ω in cardiff and barrash 2015 during the test at a selected well the other eight wells responses are collected for inverse modeling we then use vsaft2 to simulate the oht surveys by solving the frequency domain s governing equation eq 3 the aggregation based algebraic multigrid method notay 2010 2012 notay and napov 2012 similarly we derive the sensitivity using the adjoint method in the frequency domain afterward simsle in vsaft2 estimates the t field over the entire domain we use the same means variances and correlation lengths as those used to generate the random field as the prior information of simsle to focus on the effect of different pumping frequencies on the estimate following previous studies that claim improvements due to multifrequency tests we treat the s field as known and estimate the t field only also we evaluate t estimates in the near field the area within 15 m from the center of the domain or 3 times of the correlation length and the entire domain near field estimates we summarize in fig 8 the mean and standard deviation of r2 and l2 of the near field t estimates of the mc experiments at different frequencies once again we observe large standard deviations of r2 and l2 for different frequencies indicative of large variability of the oht performance between different realizations the mean and standard deviation of r2 and l2 remain almost identical despite the pumping rate frequency based on t test table 2 we find that the differences in mean r and l2 values between the estimates using different single frequencies and the combination of all frequencies are statistically insignificant i e no consistency in the test these results suggest that using multiple frequencies in oht does not necessarily improve the estimation on average for a single realization the near field s estimates are displayed in fig 9a to e they are for periods 400 1600 3600 10800 and the combination respectively their scatter plots are illustrated in fig 9f through j visual comparisons of fig 9a through e with the reference field in fig 7b reveal that estimates using different single frequencies and multifrequency capture the reference field s general features however the slope intercept r2 and l2 values of the scatter plots indicate that the estimates based on period 1600 and all periods are the best although the former s slope and intercept are better than the latter also notice that from period 10 800 is the worst again the estimate using multifrequency fig 9j is not superior to others in this single realization entire domain estimates examining the mc estimates over the entire domain we find that the mean and standard deviation of r2 and l2 of the estimates using the multifrequency pumping rate seems slightly better than the single frequency test fig 10 nevertheless a t test table 3 indicates that the differences in mean r values between the estimates using different single frequencies and the combination of all frequencies are statistically insignificant i e no consistency in the test however the differences in mean l2 values are statistically significant these results suggest that the averaged improvements in the estimates using multiple frequency oht over many possible cases is not significant comparing figs 10 and 8 near field estimates we notice that the values of r2 of all frequencies have dropped to around 0 2 meanwhile the values of l2 have increased to 0 7 that is performance metrics r2 and l2 values are affected by the domain size since they are the statistics over the entire domain in which the uncertain estimates at far field dominate the overall statistics however these values differences between different frequencies remain similar for the near field and the entire domain the results based on a single realization are discussed below the reference t field is displayed in fig 7 the estimated t fields using the head in the frequency domain and the pumping rate with different periods 400 1600 3600 10800 and the combination of all the periods are illustrated in fig 11a b c d and e respectively the reference field s scatterplots and the estimates using different periods are plotted in fig 11f g h i and j also included in these figures are the performance metrics i e r2 l2 and slope and intercept of the linear relationship between the estimated and reference lnt these performance metrics indicate that the estimate from period 400 is the least acceptable and from all periods is the best it has slightly better values of performance metrics than the cases with periods 1600 and 3600 from these plots it is also clear that the excitations with a period of 400 cannot resolve heterogeneity beyond the near field this finding is based on the horizontal line at lnt value of 9 on the estimated field axis this line indicates that the estimates remain as the initial mean lnt no improvement due to a rapid decade of the excitations strength as the period increases this horizontal line becomes smeared indicating more heterogeneity at far field is detected although imprecisely again the domain size affects performance metrics which are statistics for the entire domain the small and large domain oht analyses suggest that the results from a single realization or experiment could be inconclusive besides the effect of boundary conditions does not influence the estimated parameter values near the well field this result is attributed to the fact that both forward and inverse simulations employ the same boundary conditions for the effects of unknown boundary conditions on ht we refer it to liu et al 2020 daranond et al 2020 and sun et al 2013 discussion a revisit of the well known first order analysis of the head variation in the time domain at a location gelhar 1993 wu et al 2005 sun et al 2013 should elucidate the results mentioned above note that the first order analysis has been proved valid for the variance of lnt even greater than 1 highly nonlinear problems and has been widely adopted e g gelhar 1993 specifically under given boundary and initial conditions and known stress simulated head perturbation deviation from the mean head at any location in a heterogeneous aquifer can be approximated as a sum of the product of the head sensitivity to and the magnitude of the heterogeneity t perturbation around its mean at every aquifer location consequently a large t perturbation at a far distance where the sensitivity is low could significantly impact the head at a given location similarly a small t perturbation at a high sensitivity area may have little impact on the head at that location in other words knowing the sensitivity distribution alone without knowing t perturbation distribution one cannot determine the head perturbation at a location inverse modeling seeks a t field that can produce the head perturbation at observation wells the explanation above suggests that even if the sensitivity distribution due to excitation of a given frequency is known an infinite number of t perturbation fields remain yielding the same head perturbation at an observation location as illustrated in figs 6 and 7 in cardiff et al 2013 different frequencies sensitivity maps are different but maintain similar patterns a multifrequency sensitivity map would maintain a similar shape but be dominated by the low frequency even though some locations sensitivity values may differ specifically the sensitivity maps of different frequencies are highly correlated inverting a multifrequency test would include additional head observations at different frequencies at the same wells but these observations are highly correlated in other words the multifrequency test generates a system of nonlinear and mutually dependent or correlated equations because of their mutual dependence many possible heterogeneous t fields still could lead to the head values at the observation location minor differences in heads and sensitivity values due to numerical or measurement errors may produce additional t anomalies comparing with a single frequency oht these anomalies may be acceptable or unacceptable see figs 6 and 9 uncertain estimates such uncertain fluctuating results are also vivid in rmse values for cases 1 through 13 in table 1 of zhou et al 2016 due to this uncertainty mc simulation is appropriate to ensure that the multifrequency estimates improvement holds over many possible heterogeneous aquifers not just a coincidence our mc simulation results and statistical tests indicate that a multifrequency estimate is statistically similar to single low frequency estimates on average in contrast to multifrequency pumping rates adding observation wells at new locations creates new independent equations for inverse modeling if the number of equations still is less than the number of unknowns the inverse problem remains ill defined but these independent equations reduce the possible number of solutions and in turn uncertainty likewise inverse modeling starting with prior information close to the true field could yield a good estimate even though it does not add independent equations but such a prior would vary with the true field for these reasons mc simulation with the same prior is appropriate for assessing the multifrequency test s improvements 8 ergodicity this section revisits the ergodicity issue to explain the large standard deviations of r2 and l2 in the monte carlo simulation this revisit is necessary because many studies have disregarded the ergodicity assumption embedded in the inverse modeling of ill defined problems wang et al 2019 raised this issue and demonstrated that a large number of spatial observations are necessary to fulfill the ergodicity assumption as illustrated by the narrower standard deviations of performance metrics in fig 10 of their paper however the ergodicity issue in their study is somewhat different from what we encountered in the oht as a result this issue deserves a further revisit the large standard deviations of r2 and l2 in monte carlo simulation figs 2 8 and 10 indicate that estimates of oht with pumping rates of different frequencies or multifrequency could vary significantly from one realization to another we attribute these deviations to the unfulfilled ergodicity assumption ergodicity is the foundation for the application of stochastic theories to a single realization of a random field it is commonly recognized as the requirement that the aquifer must be larger than many times of the ensemble correlation scale with such a large aquifer the spatial mean variance and correlation structures of parameter heterogeneity in one realization are identical to those in the ensemble statistics however the ergodicity for the state variable fields e g head and concentration has rarely been explored as pointed out in p 48 49 of yeh et al 2015b the state variable ergodicity requires that the state variable at the observation well samples sufficient heterogeneity i e obtain representative samples of heterogeneity rev to illustrate the necessary conditions for satisfying the state variable ergodicity we use the head variance or standard deviation from the mean head in the observation well of a cross hole test in a 2 d infinite aquifer as an example first one must recognize that the head at any location theoretically is impacted by all heterogeneity in the domain once pumping starts due to the pressure propagation s diffusive nature however the influence of heterogeneity from different locations on the head is not equal in time and space for example previous cross correlation analysis indicates that the head at an observation well at early times of a cross hole test is governed by heterogeneity between pumping and observation wells however heterogeneity at both sides of the observation and pumping wells dictate its behavior at the late time this fact has been explored by wu et al 2005 sun et al 2013 and wen et al 2019 for 2 d aquifers and mao et al 2013b for 3 d unconfined aquifers while the influence of heterogeneity from different times and locations on the head is not equal the variance of a random parameter field in the ensemble sense is the same everywhere also the correlation pattern at a given time is identical regardless of the paired pumping and observation wells locations for this reason the head variance at the observation well evaluated on the mean parameter field is independent of the pair s location in the aquifer in the case of one realization the parameter perturbations t x and s x as opposed to their ensemble variances vary at different locations thus the heterogeneity in the well pair s vicinity dictates the head perturbation at the observation well to ensure that the head perturbation reflects the effects of the parameters ensemble variability one must simulate a cross hole test for a long time in a large domain many times of the correlation scale of the parameter otherwise many cross hole tests must be performed at many locations in these cases the head experiences the same spatial statistics as the ensemble one i e state variable ergodicity is met in the cases where a small domain is used monte carlo simulation is a must it derives many possible heads at the observation well during a cross hole test at fixed locations using many random field realizations in this domain this study examines each element s conditional parameter estimate in a highly parameterized model aquifer given some observed heads since the problem is under determined many possible estimates exist like the head variance discussed previously the estimates are dictated by the local heterogeneity near the observation and pumping wells therefore the performance metrics e g r2 and l2 of the estimates could vary with the oht well locations or from one realization to another as demonstrated by the single realization s result in the previous sections to obtain the metrics representative values one needs a dense well field which permits the observed heads in the inverse model to experience sufficient heterogeneity to satisfy the state variable ergodicity fig 11 in wang et al 2019 otherwise conducting a monte carlo simulation of oht at a given well field and evaluating the average oht performance over many realizations of this aquifer s heterogeneity is necessary this approach ensures the meaningful statistical evaluation of the inverse modeling results many published works have overlooked this ergodicity issue and claimed that using a sparse network in one heterogeneous field oht or ppt increases the estimate resolution these claims are subjective since neither is the above ergodicity issue recognized nor has the theoretical proof been provided 9 conclusion this paper conducts a stochastic analysis to elucidate the effectiveness of delineating aquifer hydraulic heterogeneity using a periodic pumping test or an oscillatory hydraulic tomography the analysis shows that unknown heterogeneity heads and fluxes produce the ensemble residual flux and storage terms in the ensemble mean equations these terms lead to frequency dependence scenario dependence and dynamic effects of effective hydraulic parameters further this analysis shows that manipulating the frequency of the pumping rate does not eliminate these terms these terms vanish only if t and s distributions or water level and flux fields are measured everywhere results of monte carlo simulation confirm the analysis that the multifrequency ppt or oht does not increase the resolution of aquifer characterization the robustness of multifrequency tests proclaimed by the previous studies misunderstood the following 1 change in sensitivity value alone does not warrant estimates improvements that is according to some sensitivity analysis multifrequency excitations may appear to bring forth some additional information still without additional observation wells the heterogeneity s location remains unknown 2 the ergodicity assumption ingrained in the ill defined inverse problems is overlooked in other words the results of ppt or oht from a single realization or experiment could be misleading for these reasons we advocate that monte carlo simulation must be employed to evaluate such inverse modeling s results moreover the dense monitoring network and cost effective data collection procedure are the keys to aquifer characterization such common sense is however often ignored lastly we do not discredit oht or ppt as noticed by many the oscillating signals can easily extract from background signals such as the sensor noise sensor drift and other hydraulic influences e g another nearby pumping river stage changes etc however constant rate pumping tests could overcome these issues if the temporal sampling is sufficiently dense and the signal to noise ratio is large enough mao et al 2011 2013b nevertheless oht is extremely useful in characterizing contaminated aquifers where contaminated groundwater and discharge are prohibited for this reason oht is highly desirable for pump and treat remediation sites where groundwater is pumped out for treatments and reinjected back to aquifers 10 key points 1 manipulating pumping rate frequency alone does not warrant estimate improvement 2 monte carlo simulation shows that the estimates from different frequencies and multifrequency tests are indistinguishable on average 3 a dense wellfield or monte carlo simulation is necessary to satisfy the ergodicity embedded in inverse modeling

4714,this paper investigates the effectiveness of different oscillatory hydraulic tomography oht frequencies for estimating heterogeneous fields the analysis first formulates the effects of uncharacterized aquifer responses t and s fields as the ensemble mean residual flux and residual storage terms in the stochastic unconditional and conditional mean equations these terms persist unless the t s or head fields are specified everywhere we then conducted oht to estimate the t and s fields using monte carlo experiments the experiments show that using the heads in response to periodic pumping with different frequencies or multifrequency the estimates performance metrics vary from one realization to others the mean performance metrics over many realizations are however indistinguishable despite the frequency we attribute the variation in the performance metrics to the lack of parameter or state variable ergodicity lastly we emphasize the importance of dense monitoring networks and a cost effective data collection strategy to improve the resolution of characterizing aquifer heterogeneity 1 introduction conventionally transmissivity t and storage coefficient s are estimated using a constant rate pumping or injection test and methods of analysis such as thiem 1906 theis 1935 or cooper and jacob 1946 periodic pumping tests ppt hydraulic tests with periodically varying pumping rates have also been proposed to estimate these properties for example black and kipp 1981 developed methods for estimating diffusivity based on analytical solutions in terms of the pressure attenuation and the phase lag during a sinusoidal point or line excitations they concluded that the methods are not a substitute for conventional aquifer testing due to time and equipment costs still they are a useful tool to apply in specific applications butler and mcelwee 1990 examined the head s sensitivity at pumping well to different known t values at 6 zones concentrically circling the well a 1 d radial flow they stated that variations in the pumping rate increase the drawdown s sensitivities to each layer s property without estimating the property they concluded that the estimate s uncertainty could be reduced rasmussen et al 2003 and renner and messar 2006 applied the ppt to field aquifers they found that the estimated properties were hydraulic properties averaged over different volumes of heterogeneous subsurface and consistent with conventional aquifer tests they emphasized that the approach minimizes investigation derived wastes e g contaminated groundwater and introduces a signal different from background perturbations easy to detect with small scale soil column experiments song and renner 2008 reported that the pressure analysis yields a relatively constant permeability for the high porosity sample at different pressures and oscillation periods they found slightly period dependent permeability for the low porosity samples and the stacked sample the period dependence diminishes with increasing period rabinovich et al 2013 theoretically investigated heterogeneous aquifers effective conductivity in unsteady periodic flow by a stochastic approach they concluded that the effective conductivity and the ensemble mean head and flux have significant dynamic effects on the other hand guiltinan and becker 2015 used constant rate pumping tests and periodic slug tests to detect wells hydraulic connectivity in fractured bedrock at a field site they neglected early time drawdown behaviors and analyzed the effective hydraulic diffusivity by fitting the late time drawdown to theis curve based on homogeneous aquifers they suggested that the periodic tests estimated field is more sensitive to the hydraulic connectivity among well pairs than those from the constant rate pumping test the value of estimated hydraulic diffusivity from the periodic tests approaches that of the constant rate test as the oscillation frequency decreases similarly the usefulness of periodic pumping has also been investigated by fischer et al 2018 schuite et al 2017 and lavenue and demarsily 2001 for the karstic and fractured aquifer characterization by sun et al 2015 and sun et al 2017 for leakage detection and by rabinovich et al 2015 for imaging unconfined aquifer ahn and horne 2010 developed analytical solutions for attenuation and phase shift of pressure pulse testing in a 1 d radial flow through 3 concentric layers of different permeability with 10 unknown permeability blocks surrounding the test well they reported that the attenuation and phase shift provided an indicator characteristic to reveal reservoir heterogeneity likewise based on numerical experiments cardiff et al 2013 reported that including head data from pumping with different frequencies can improve the aquifer hydraulic parameter estimates even if the pumping is only conducted in one pumping well on the other hand hydraulic tomography ht with constant pumping rates has been proposed as a new aquifer characterization method yeh and liu 2000 zhu and yeh 2005 it has been proven over the past two decades as a matured technology for high resolution characterization of saturated and variably saturated porous media e g cardiff and barrash 2011 mao et al 2013b berg and illman 2011 2015 zhao and illman 2018 and fractured rocks at fields and laboratories illman et al 2009 zha et al 2016 further theoretical and physical explanations of the robustness of tomographic surveys have been provided by wen et al 2019 sun et al 2013 huang et al 2011 and yeh et al 2014 recently zhou et al 2016 reported that head collected from oscillatory hydraulic tomography oht with multifrequency excitations provides better estimates than those from single frequency excitations when the number of pumping tests and observation locations is limited on the contrary results of the monte carlo experiment of aquifer characterization using river stage variation with different frequencies by wang et al 2019 signify that the estimated t field s ensemble averaged performance is independent of frequency they implied that previously reported improvements of estimates using different frequencies based on one realization of heterogeneity are not warranted for all possible realizations however the river stage tomography is not the same as oht and wang et al 2019 only investigated the effect of different single frequencies and did not evaluate the performance of river stage variations of multifrequency this paper aims to explain that neglecting heterogeneity introduces the frequency and scenario dependence estimated parameters more importantly this paper demonstrates that excitations of multifrequency do not overcome difficulties associated with the under determined nature of the inverse problems and do not necessarily improve the heterogeneity estimates finally the importance of considering flow ergodicity issues for evaluating the robustness of inverse models is stressed 2 groundwater flow model this study assumes that the following equations describe 2 d plan view groundwater flow induced by periodic pumping at a well during oht in a heterogeneous confined aquifer 1 t x h x t s x h x t t q t δ x x p where h represents the head responses l t is transmissivity l2 t s is storage coefficient x is the vector in and y directions δ is dirac delta function x p denotes the coordinate of pumping well and t represents time t the periodic pumping rate with a given amplitude q 0 is expressed as 2 q t q 0 exp 2 π i ω t in which ω is the frequency cycle t and i is the imaginary unit the positive pumping rate represents extraction the piezometric head s initial condition is uniform and the boundary condition can be prescribed head or flux boundaries expressing the above equations in the frequency domain leads to 3 t x ϕ i ω s x ϕ q 0 where ϕ is the phasor l which is a complex variable containing the information of head amplitude and phase lag the boundary condition can be prescribed phasor or flux boundaries 3 stochastic analysis of ppt in heterogeneous aquifers investigation of the effects of oht on the estimated t and s in aquifers is most appropriate to formulate the problem in a stochastic framework and consider the periodic pumping at a single well first since t x and s x are spatially varying and they are difficult to determine at every location of the aquifer the stochastic analysis conceptualizes t and s as random fields which can be expressed as 4 t x t t x and s x s s x where t and s are unconditional means which are invariant in space and ensemble note that the overhead bar stands for the expected value t x the unconditional perturbations at each x are characterized by their unconditional covariance functions which are assumed to be exponential these covariance functions specify the spatial variance i e the perturbations uncertainty and the spatial relationship between perturbations in the ensemble sense accordingly many possible ϕ x ω fields exist in this aquifer in response to an oscillatory pumping test with a given q0 at a frequency ω these fields are thus considered as a random field and can be expressed by 5 ϕ x ω ϕ x ω ϕ x ω in which ϕ x ω is the unconditional ensemble mean and ϕ x ω is the perturbation at x with a frequency ω substituting eqs 4 and 5 into eq 3 we have 6 t t x ϕ x ω ϕ x ω i ω s s x ϕ x ω ϕ x ω q 0 instead of all possible ϕ x fields induced by the pumping with a given frequency we seek the most likely unconditional mean of ϕ x thus we take the expected value of eq 6 and we have the following 7 e t e s e ϕ 0 and e t x ϕ x ω e t x ϕ x ω note that perturbation expectation is zero and the dominated convergence theorem is lim x 0 f f f is any function substituting eqs 7 into eq 6 we have 8 t ϕ t ϕ i ω s ϕ i ω s ϕ q 0 where again the overhead bar denotes the expected value or ensemble average notice that the x ω for ϕ and x for t and s are dropped hereafter this equation is called the ensemble unconditional mean flow equation it describes ϕ field the most likely ϕ field in responses to an oscillatory pumping test with a given frequency this ensemble mean equation shows that the unconditional t s and ϕ alone do not satisfy the mass balance equation unless two additional terms are included one of the terms t ϕ or the ensemble unconditional mean residual flux e g neuman and orr 1993 guadagnini and neuman 1999 is the unconditional cross covariance of variations between ϕ and t the other term s ϕ is the ensemble unconditional mean residual storage or the cross covariance of variations between s and ϕ these two terms represent the contributions of unknown perturbations t s and ϕ to the mean flow equation gelhar 1986 3 1 unconditional and conditional effective approaches next we examine the impacts of t ϕ and s ϕ in stochastic modeling approaches on the unconditional or conditional estimates of t and s fields which yield the most likely unconditional or conditional ϕ field i e ensemble mean field 3 1 1 unconditional approach suppose t x and s x of the aquifer are entirely unknown and we adopt the equivalent homogeneous media ehm model to predict the unconditional ensemble mean of ϕ then eq 8 can be rewritten as 9 t eff 2 ϕ i ω s eff ϕ q 0 in which t eff t t ϕ 2 ϕ 1 and s eff s s ϕ ϕ 1 are the unconditional effective parameters here the effective parameters are assumed to be invariant in ensemble and space while some theoretical analyses e g indelman 2003 showed that they might vary with radial distance near the pumping well and then approach some constant values at large radial distances tartakovsky and neuman 1998 investigated the effect of temporal nonlocality on one and three dimensional mean flows in infinite statistically homogeneous media rabinovich et al 2013 found that the unconditional effective t derived from the periodic pumping test is frequency dependent and varying with the variance of t this means that additional term i e t ϕ 2 ϕ 1 in the effective parameter varies with the frequency of pumping rates these effective parameters yield the most likely averaged ϕ field over all possible heterogeneity the unconditional ϕ field under the given periodic pumping discharge the deviation from its unconditional mean ϕ the uncertainty and spatial variability of ϕ at any location is quantified by the unconditional variance ϕ the application of the effective parameters to a field condition requires the ergodicity assumption that is this unconditional mean field ϕ in an aquifer should reproduce the general pattern of observed ϕ values in the least squared sense but does not honor the observed ϕ value at each observation location see wu et al 2005 yeh et al 2015a 3 1 2 conditional approach the conditional approach adopts the highly parameterized conceptual model and requires that the conditional t s and mean ϕ fields reproduce measured t s and ϕ values at the sampling locations yeh et al 1996 three possible conditional scenarios are discussed below scenario a if t x and s x at every location are given precisely without any uncertainty eq 8 reduces to 10 t c x ϕ c i ω s c x ϕ c q 0 the subscript c denotes conditional and the overhead bar again represents the expectation in this case the conditional mean fields are identical to the given realization i e t c x t x and s c x s x since t and s are fully specified the exact ϕ is equal to the fully conditioned mean head field ϕ c and can be solved uniquely with the given initial and boundary conditions notice that t ϕ and s ϕ vanish in this equation scenario b this scenario represents the case where the ϕ value at every location is known precisely but t and s fields are entirely unknown under this circumstance the following conditioned mean flow equation depicts the ϕ fields t t ϕ c i ω s s ϕ c q 0 or 11 t ϕ c i ω s ϕ c t ϕ c i ω s ϕ c q 0 notice that ϕ c is a fully conditioned mean or the true ϕ field with zero variance i e uncertainty t and s are unconditional mean values which are known and constant in space and the ensemble while t and s are unknown perturbations in eq 11 the first two terms are the known net flux at each location resulting from the known t and s and the known ϕ c the second two terms denote the unknown net flux and storage perturbations at each location due to the unknown t and s and the known ϕ c field although t ϕ and s ϕ disappear in eq 11 estimation of t and s remains an under determined inverse problem due to the unknown spatial distribution of the flux induced by q 0 that is many possible t and s pairs lead to the same head field unless t and s or the spatial distribution of flux along the boundaries are specified mao et al 2013a yeh et al 2015a 2015b because all the variables associated with frequency ω i e the first two terms in eq 11 ϕ c ω and q o are specified the system of equations to be solved is independent of frequency and so are the estimated t and s scenario c suppose ϕ t and s are known exactly at some not all locations in the aquifer the terms t ϕ and s ϕ in eq 8 are zero at locations where t and s are specified and at others are non zero the residual head variances likewise are zero at locations where heads are known but the residual t and s variances at these head locations are non zero although they become small e g p 286 in cheng et al 2019 therefore the ensemble mean equation becomes 12 t effc x ϕ c i ω s effc x ϕ c q 0 t effc x and s effc x are the conditional effective parameters which honor the sample values at the sample locations these parameters under the given flow conditions yield the conditional mean head fields ϕ c that reproduce the observed heads at the observation wells yeh et al 1996 these effective parameters are the sum of their unconditional means i e t and s and the contributions from the non zero t ϕ and s ϕ terms after conditioning with sparse measurements of ϕ t and s since the variable ϕ ingrained in these non zero terms vary with the frequency the conditional effective parameters are frequency dependent because of the frequency dependent nature of the conditional effective parameters some studies as discussed in the introduction found that a pumping test with a multifrequency rate could lead to a more detailed characterization of the heterogeneity than that with a constant rate or single frequency the expectation nature of the two non zero terms conditional cross covariance in the conditional mean flow equation may explain these findings as we have remarked in scenarios a and b these terms become small or vanish only if t s or ϕ are specified at some locations that is without adding additional observation wells or parameter measurements manipulating pumping rates with different frequencies does not remove these cross covariance terms but changes their patterns as reflected in the sensitivity maps in figs 6 and 7 of cardiff et al 2013 nevertheless these terms are still ensemble averaged relationships between many possible t s and ϕ fields that is many combinations of these fields can lead to the same cross covariance pattern during the inverse modeling using data from multifrequency pumping rates these cross covariance terms remain unresolved and many possible solutions exist the previous studies claiming improvements in the estimates are likely due to the simple heterogeneity pattern considered in their studies e g ahn and horne 2010 which only have a limited number of possibilities consequently adding additional frequency information may lead the estimates to a similar but not exact heterogeneous pattern as the number of the unknowns becomes large and the pattern becomes complex the possibility of obtaining a close estimate by using a multifrequency would be as slight as using single frequency data 4 conditional effective parameter estimator simsle to substantiate our points in section 3 1 2 scenario c we use a conditional effective parameter estimator to conduct numerical experiments in section 5 the simsle simultaneous successive linear estimator xiang et al 2009 is an extension of sle successive linear estimator yeh et al 1995 1996 they are parameter estimation algorithms built upon the stochastic conditional expectation concept priestley 1979 and the hydrogeology cokriging concept kitanidis and vomvoris 1983 dagan 1985 the algorithm also considers the nonlinear relationship between the state variable e g water level and the parameters kitanidis 1995 yeh et al 1995 in summary it is a stochastic nonlinear estimator that derives the conditional effective parameter fields with given locally measured parameter values and observed heads and yields conditional mean and covariance of head fields as discussed in the section 3 1 2 scenario c and gao et al 2021 recognizing the non redundant information collected by tomographic surveys as elucidated in wen et al 2019 yeh and liu 2000 developed the 3 d steady state hydraulic tomography and zhu and yeh 2005 built the 3 d transient hydraulic tomography based on the sle to further estimate the conditional effective parameters over the past two decades simsle has become a mature inverse model for hydraulic tomography in heterogeneous porous media as well as fractured rocks recently cheng et al 2019 proposed a linear cokriging technique for oscillatory hydraulic tomography a detailed description of simsle is available in many publications below is a brief description of the algorithm for this study mathematically simsle is similar to the kalman filter developed for time domain stochastic processes it iteratively determines the conditional effective parameter fields t eff x and s eff x in section 3 1 2 scenario c using the linear estimator 13 f r 1 f r ε ff r j fh r j fh r t ε ff r j fh r μ θ 1 h h r in which f r is an m 1 vector m is the total

head information is included albeit the residual variance is an approximation a small value indicates that the estimated effective lnt or lns likely is close to the true fields a large value indicates the uncertainty is not resolved again this uncertainty is an ensemble statistic and is not equal to the actual difference between the true and estimate the iterative update is terminated if the mean squared error of simulated and observed heads is smaller than a specified tolerance e g 10 7 or the increase of the spatial variance of the estimated parameter becomes insignificant between successive iterations that is the algorithm is unable to extract further heterogeneity information contained in the observed heads 5 monte carlo numerical experiments oht attempts to solve the under determined inverse problems scenario c with conditioning only on the head which have many possible solutions utilizing heads induced by excitations with different frequencies for inverse modeling may result in accidentally superior or poor estimates monte carlo mc experiments therefore are necessary to verify the oht s reliability the simulation domain of the mc experiments is a 2 d horizontal confined aquifer consisting of 40 40 square elements each element is 30 m 30 m the aquifer is bounded by a constant head boundary of 30 m the initial head is 30 m everywhere in this experiment we solve the time domain governing flow equations eqs 1 and 2 and use 32 time steps to represent a single periodic cycle to ensure the results accuracy two hundred realizations of random fields with given means of t and s 0 01 m2 min and 10 5 variances of lnt and lns 2 and 0 5 and correlation lengths λ x λ y 400 m are generated using a spectral method gutjahr 1989 robin et al 1993 nine wells are installed in the aquifer circles in fig 1 an oht using four pumping wells square in fig 1 with periodic pumping rates of four periods ω 1 15 20 50 and 100 min cycle is used in each realization that is each realization includes 16 individual pumping tests 4 frequencies times 4 pumping wells afterward the simulated head responses 32 timesteps of the last cycle at monitoring wells after the flow reaches quasi steady are utilized for the inversion this analysis is conducted in the time domain the analysis based on the frequency domain is presented in the later section the prior information for simsle consists of the same means variances and correlation lengths as those used to generate the random field we use the same geostatistical parameters as the generated random fields to focus on different pumping frequencies effects on the estimate the computation is implemented in a variably saturated flow finite element model vsaft2 yeh et al 1993 available at http tian hwr arizona edu downloads to estimate t and s with observed heads under different frequencies and multifrequency we use the coefficient of determination r2 and the mean squared error l2 norm as the performance metrics to evaluate each realization s estimates t estimates fig 2a displays the mean and standard deviation of r2 and l2 between the reference and estimated t fields resulting from 200 realizations based on different single frequencies and those of the combination of all frequencies the left side axis of the plot is for r2 and the right side axis is for l2 as displayed in the figure large standard deviations of r2 for different frequencies suggest that the oht survey s performance could vary significantly from one realization to another interestingly the mean and standard deviation of r2 and l2 of the 200 realizations are almost identical despite the frequency ω in the multifrequency case the mean r2 is 0 66 with a standard deviation of 0 11 the mean l2 is 0 030 with a standard deviation of 0 016 these values are similar to those cases with a single frequency this result indicates that using multiple frequencies in oht does not improve the estimates averaged over the 200 realizations s estimates performance metrics of estimated s fields in fig 2b show that the mean and standard deviation of r2 and l2 are nearly identical regardless of the pumping rate frequency oht using the multifrequency yields 0 57 for the mean r2 with 0 12 for the standard deviation the mean l2 is 2 6 10 5 and the standard deviation is 6 9 10 6 again using the multifrequency in oht does not improve the s estimates a two sided t test to further support our conclusion above we carry out a two sided t test with 95 confidence interval to certify if the difference in mean values between the multiple and single frequencies is significant or not table 1 lists the t values corresponding to the results in fig 2a and b if the t value is greater than 1 97 or less than 1 97 the difference is significant in the table the values labeled by indicate the difference is significant i e the multifrequency improves the estimate the values without indicate the difference is not significant i e the multifrequency does not improve the estimate the t values of l2 and r in table 1 show that t s estimate from multifrequency data does not significantly differ from those from the single frequency in contrast the estimate of s may slightly differ from those from the single frequency number of realizations a sufficient number of realizations is a must to ensure the representativeness of mc experiment s results fig 3a and b show the means and standard deviations of r2 and l2 as a function of the number of realizations they confirm that 200 realizations are sufficiently large to support our findings in other words the mc results certify that in many trials manipulating pumping frequency does not reduce the conditional residual flux t ϕ and residual storage s ϕ as indicated by the nearly constant means and large standard deviations of r2 and l2 in fig 2 specifically had the estimates been improved close to the correct field the residual flux and storage terms should have diminished so should the means and standard deviations as discussed in section 3 1 2 we emphasize that additional non redundant information from additional pumping or observation wells wen et al 2019 wang et al 2019 guarantees the estimate s improvement 6 single realization we also present the results based on a single realization below the reference t and s fields and the wells for this case are displayed in fig 4a and b estimated t the estimated t fields using the oht with the pumping rate of the periods 15 20 50 100 and the combination of all the periods are displayed in fig 5a b c d and e respectively in fig 5f g h i and j we show the scatter plots of the reference field against the estimated based on oht with different periods also included in these figures are the regression lines slope and intercept the correlation between the estimated and reference lnt r2 and the mean squared error of lnt l2 according to these figures oht using different single or multifrequency excitations captures the general pattern of heterogeneity excitations of different frequencies improve the estimates at some locations and worsen them at others there is no clear winner or loser for characterizing the detailed parameter variations intuitively a low frequency long period excitation could cover a greater area than the high frequencies high frequency short period excitations could map details near the well field consequently a multifrequency a mixture of different periods excitation combining various frequencies merits could improve the overall estimate nevertheless the scatter plots of this realization suggest otherwise in particular the slope intercept r2 and l2 values indicate that the estimate based on a period of 15 a high frequency is least satisfactory and based on a period of 20 is the best the scatter plots also indicate that the estimate based on all frequencies multifrequency fig 5j is worse than that in fig 5i based on a long period of 100 a low frequency the results of this realization contradict the intuition however they corroborate the large standard deviations in r2 and l2 values in fig 2 they further demand mc experiments to assess the reliability of the oht estimates for ill defined inverse problems estimated s plots similar to those in fig 5 are presented in fig 6 a through j for s estimates akin to the results in fig 5 ohts with different frequencies create different local scale anomalies but derive a similar general spatial distribution fig 6f shows that excitation with a period of 15 yields the least acceptable estimate the slope intercept r2 and l2 values in fig 6j from multifrequency excitation are superior to those with different single frequencies these results seem to follow our intuition but contradict the previous findings based on the t estimates this contradiction may be because t and s behave differently and interact with each other such conflicting t and s estimates behaviors highlight the uncertainty in results from oht with excitations of different frequencies in a single realization the mc simulations thus are deemed to be appropriate 7 effects of domain size and time domain solution to show that the results in the above examples are independent of the domain size the correlation scale and the solution technique i e time or frequency domain solution we present an additional mc example solved by the frequency domain equations eq 3 the new aquifer is 98 m 98 m consisting of 70 70 rectangular elements the grid spacing varies as shown in fig 7 the oht uses nine wells fig 7 and the horizontal and vertical spacings between the two wells are 5 m the spacing is 9 times smaller than the size of the entire domain the width of the element is 0 5 m near the well and 2 m in the remote region a zero amplitude boundary bounds the aquifer for this mc simulation six hundred realizations of a random t field with a mean of t 10 4 m2 s and a variance of 1 in lnt and correlation lengths are λ x λ y 5 m the s field is homogeneous with a value of 10 4 as in previous oht analyses by others the oht surveys employ three sequential pumping tests at three wells square in fig 7 with periodic pumping rates of four periods ω 1 400 1600 3600 and 10800 s cycle as a result 12 individual pumping tests 4 frequencies times 3 pumping wells are conducted for each realization the numerical accuracy limits the selection of the lower periods the radius of influence corresponding to each period is 20 40 60 and 104 m based on the formula i e the distance of signal propagation is proportional to t s ω in cardiff and barrash 2015 during the test at a selected well the other eight wells responses are collected for inverse modeling we then use vsaft2 to simulate the oht surveys by solving the frequency domain s governing equation eq 3 the aggregation based algebraic multigrid method notay 2010 2012 notay and napov 2012 similarly we derive the sensitivity using the adjoint method in the frequency domain afterward simsle in vsaft2 estimates the t field over the entire domain we use the same means variances and correlation lengths as those used to generate the random field as the prior information of simsle to focus on the effect of different pumping frequencies on the estimate following previous studies that claim improvements due to multifrequency tests we treat the s field as known and estimate the t field only also we evaluate t estimates in the near field the area within 15 m from the center of the domain or 3 times of the correlation length and the entire domain near field estimates we summarize in fig 8 the mean and standard deviation of r2 and l2 of the near field t estimates of the mc experiments at different frequencies once again we observe large standard deviations of r2 and l2 for different frequencies indicative of large variability of the oht performance between different realizations the mean and standard deviation of r2 and l2 remain almost identical despite the pumping rate frequency based on t test table 2 we find that the differences in mean r and l2 values between the estimates using different single frequencies and the combination of all frequencies are statistically insignificant i e no consistency in the test these results suggest that using multiple frequencies in oht does not necessarily improve the estimation on average for a single realization the near field s estimates are displayed in fig 9a to e they are for periods 400 1600 3600 10800 and the combination respectively their scatter plots are illustrated in fig 9f through j visual comparisons of fig 9a through e with the reference field in fig 7b reveal that estimates using different single frequencies and multifrequency capture the reference field s general features however the slope intercept r2 and l2 values of the scatter plots indicate that the estimates based on period 1600 and all periods are the best although the former s slope and intercept are better than the latter also notice that from period 10 800 is the worst again the estimate using multifrequency fig 9j is not superior to others in this single realization entire domain estimates examining the mc estimates over the entire domain we find that the mean and standard deviation of r2 and l2 of the estimates using the multifrequency pumping rate seems slightly better than the single frequency test fig 10 nevertheless a t test table 3 indicates that the differences in mean r values between the estimates using different single frequencies and the combination of all frequencies are statistically insignificant i e no consistency in the test however the differences in mean l2 values are statistically significant these results suggest that the averaged improvements in the estimates using multiple frequency oht over many possible cases is not significant comparing figs 10 and 8 near field estimates we notice that the values of r2 of all frequencies have dropped to around 0 2 meanwhile the values of l2 have increased to 0 7 that is performance metrics r2 and l2 values are affected by the domain size since they are the statistics over the entire domain in which the uncertain estimates at far field dominate the overall statistics however these values differences between different frequencies remain similar for the near field and the entire domain the results based on a single realization are discussed below the reference t field is displayed in fig 7 the estimated t fields using the head in the frequency domain and the pumping rate with different periods 400 1600 3600 10800 and the combination of all the periods are illustrated in fig 11a b c d and e respectively the reference field s scatterplots and the estimates using different periods are plotted in fig 11f g h i and j also included in these figures are the performance metrics i e r2 l2 and slope and intercept of the linear relationship between the estimated and reference lnt these performance metrics indicate that the estimate from period 400 is the least acceptable and from all periods is the best it has slightly better values of performance metrics than the cases with periods 1600 and 3600 from these plots it is also clear that the excitations with a period of 400 cannot resolve heterogeneity beyond the near field this finding is based on the horizontal line at lnt value of 9 on the estimated field axis this line indicates that the estimates remain as the initial mean lnt no improvement due to a rapid decade of the excitations strength as the period increases this horizontal line becomes smeared indicating more heterogeneity at far field is detected although imprecisely again the domain size affects performance metrics which are statistics for the entire domain the small and large domain oht analyses suggest that the results from a single realization or experiment could be inconclusive besides the effect of boundary conditions does not influence the estimated parameter values near the well field this result is attributed to the fact that both forward and inverse simulations employ the same boundary conditions for the effects of unknown boundary conditions on ht we refer it to liu et al 2020 daranond et al 2020 and sun et al 2013 discussion a revisit of the well known first order analysis of the head variation in the time domain at a location gelhar 1993 wu et al 2005 sun et al 2013 should elucidate the results mentioned above note that the first order analysis has been proved valid for the variance of lnt even greater than 1 highly nonlinear problems and has been widely adopted e g gelhar 1993 specifically under given boundary and initial conditions and known stress simulated head perturbation deviation from the mean head at any location in a heterogeneous aquifer can be approximated as a sum of the product of the head sensitivity to and the magnitude of the heterogeneity t perturbation around its mean at every aquifer location consequently a large t perturbation at a far distance where the sensitivity is low could significantly impact the head at a given location similarly a small t perturbation at a high sensitivity area may have little impact on the head at that location in other words knowing the sensitivity distribution alone without knowing t perturbation distribution one cannot determine the head perturbation at a location inverse modeling seeks a t field that can produce the head perturbation at observation wells the explanation above suggests that even if the sensitivity distribution due to excitation of a given frequency is known an infinite number of t perturbation fields remain yielding the same head perturbation at an observation location as illustrated in figs 6 and 7 in cardiff et al 2013 different frequencies sensitivity maps are different but maintain similar patterns a multifrequency sensitivity map would maintain a similar shape but be dominated by the low frequency even though some locations sensitivity values may differ specifically the sensitivity maps of different frequencies are highly correlated inverting a multifrequency test would include additional head observations at different frequencies at the same wells but these observations are highly correlated in other words the multifrequency test generates a system of nonlinear and mutually dependent or correlated equations because of their mutual dependence many possible heterogeneous t fields still could lead to the head values at the observation location minor differences in heads and sensitivity values due to numerical or measurement errors may produce additional t anomalies comparing with a single frequency oht these anomalies may be acceptable or unacceptable see figs 6 and 9 uncertain estimates such uncertain fluctuating results are also vivid in rmse values for cases 1 through 13 in table 1 of zhou et al 2016 due to this uncertainty mc simulation is appropriate to ensure that the multifrequency estimates improvement holds over many possible heterogeneous aquifers not just a coincidence our mc simulation results and statistical tests indicate that a multifrequency estimate is statistically similar to single low frequency estimates on average in contrast to multifrequency pumping rates adding observation wells at new locations creates new independent equations for inverse modeling if the number of equations still is less than the number of unknowns the inverse problem remains ill defined but these independent equations reduce the possible number of solutions and in turn uncertainty likewise inverse modeling starting with prior information close to the true field could yield a good estimate even though it does not add independent equations but such a prior would vary with the true field for these reasons mc simulation with the same prior is appropriate for assessing the multifrequency test s improvements 8 ergodicity this section revisits the ergodicity issue to explain the large standard deviations of r2 and l2 in the monte carlo simulation this revisit is necessary because many studies have disregarded the ergodicity assumption embedded in the inverse modeling of ill defined problems wang et al 2019 raised this issue and demonstrated that a large number of spatial observations are necessary to fulfill the ergodicity assumption as illustrated by the narrower standard deviations of performance metrics in fig 10 of their paper however the ergodicity issue in their study is somewhat different from what we encountered in the oht as a result this issue deserves a further revisit the large standard deviations of r2 and l2 in monte carlo simulation figs 2 8 and 10 indicate that estimates of oht with pumping rates of different frequencies or multifrequency could vary significantly from one realization to another we attribute these deviations to the unfulfilled ergodicity assumption ergodicity is the foundation for the application of stochastic theories to a single realization of a random field it is commonly recognized as the requirement that the aquifer must be larger than many times of the ensemble correlation scale with such a large aquifer the spatial mean variance and correlation structures of parameter heterogeneity in one realization are identical to those in the ensemble statistics however the ergodicity for the state variable fields e g head and concentration has rarely been explored as pointed out in p 48 49 of yeh et al 2015b the state variable ergodicity requires that the state variable at the observation well samples sufficient heterogeneity i e obtain representative samples of heterogeneity rev to illustrate the necessary conditions for satisfying the state variable ergodicity we use the head variance or standard deviation from the mean head in the observation well of a cross hole test in a 2 d infinite aquifer as an example first one must recognize that the head at any location theoretically is impacted by all heterogeneity in the domain once pumping starts due to the pressure propagation s diffusive nature however the influence of heterogeneity from different locations on the head is not equal in time and space for example previous cross correlation analysis indicates that the head at an observation well at early times of a cross hole test is governed by heterogeneity between pumping and observation wells however heterogeneity at both sides of the observation and pumping wells dictate its behavior at the late time this fact has been explored by wu et al 2005 sun et al 2013 and wen et al 2019 for 2 d aquifers and mao et al 2013b for 3 d unconfined aquifers while the influence of heterogeneity from different times and locations on the head is not equal the variance of a random parameter field in the ensemble sense is the same everywhere also the correlation pattern at a given time is identical regardless of the paired pumping and observation wells locations for this reason the head variance at the observation well evaluated on the mean parameter field is independent of the pair s location in the aquifer in the case of one realization the parameter perturbations t x and s x as opposed to their ensemble variances vary at different locations thus the heterogeneity in the well pair s vicinity dictates the head perturbation at the observation well to ensure that the head perturbation reflects the effects of the parameters ensemble variability one must simulate a cross hole test for a long time in a large domain many times of the correlation scale of the parameter otherwise many cross hole tests must be performed at many locations in these cases the head experiences the same spatial statistics as the ensemble one i e state variable ergodicity is met in the cases where a small domain is used monte carlo simulation is a must it derives many possible heads at the observation well during a cross hole test at fixed locations using many random field realizations in this domain this study examines each element s conditional parameter estimate in a highly parameterized model aquifer given some observed heads since the problem is under determined many possible estimates exist like the head variance discussed previously the estimates are dictated by the local heterogeneity near the observation and pumping wells therefore the performance metrics e g r2 and l2 of the estimates could vary with the oht well locations or from one realization to another as demonstrated by the single realization s result in the previous sections to obtain the metrics representative values one needs a dense well field which permits the observed heads in the inverse model to experience sufficient heterogeneity to satisfy the state variable ergodicity fig 11 in wang et al 2019 otherwise conducting a monte carlo simulation of oht at a given well field and evaluating the average oht performance over many realizations of this aquifer s heterogeneity is necessary this approach ensures the meaningful statistical evaluation of the inverse modeling results many published works have overlooked this ergodicity issue and claimed that using a sparse network in one heterogeneous field oht or ppt increases the estimate resolution these claims are subjective since neither is the above ergodicity issue recognized nor has the theoretical proof been provided 9 conclusion this paper conducts a stochastic analysis to elucidate the effectiveness of delineating aquifer hydraulic heterogeneity using a periodic pumping test or an oscillatory hydraulic tomography the analysis shows that unknown heterogeneity heads and fluxes produce the ensemble residual flux and storage terms in the ensemble mean equations these terms lead to frequency dependence scenario dependence and dynamic effects of effective hydraulic parameters further this analysis shows that manipulating the frequency of the pumping rate does not eliminate these terms these terms vanish only if t and s distributions or water level and flux fields are measured everywhere results of monte carlo simulation confirm the analysis that the multifrequency ppt or oht does not increase the resolution of aquifer characterization the robustness of multifrequency tests proclaimed by the previous studies misunderstood the following 1 change in sensitivity value alone does not warrant estimates improvements that is according to some sensitivity analysis multifrequency excitations may appear to bring forth some additional information still without additional observation wells the heterogeneity s location remains unknown 2 the ergodicity assumption ingrained in the ill defined inverse problems is overlooked in other words the results of ppt or oht from a single realization or experiment could be misleading for these reasons we advocate that monte carlo simulation must be employed to evaluate such inverse modeling s results moreover the dense monitoring network and cost effective data collection procedure are the keys to aquifer characterization such common sense is however often ignored lastly we do not discredit oht or ppt as noticed by many the oscillating signals can easily extract from background signals such as the sensor noise sensor drift and other hydraulic influences e g another nearby pumping river stage changes etc however constant rate pumping tests could overcome these issues if the temporal sampling is sufficiently dense and the signal to noise ratio is large enough mao et al 2011 2013b nevertheless oht is extremely useful in characterizing contaminated aquifers where contaminated groundwater and discharge are prohibited for this reason oht is highly desirable for pump and treat remediation sites where groundwater is pumped out for treatments and reinjected back to aquifers 10 key points 1 manipulating pumping rate frequency alone does not warrant estimate improvement 2 monte carlo simulation shows that the estimates from different frequencies and multifrequency tests are indistinguishable on average 3 a dense wellfield or monte carlo simulation is necessary to satisfy the ergodicity embedded in inverse modeling
