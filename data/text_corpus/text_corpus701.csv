sectors the pearl river basin prb and haihe river basin hrb in china are used as study cases to evaluate the model the results show that the pressure of water resource consumption in hrb has exceeded its carrying capacity and the pressure of water resource consumption in the prb which is rich in water resources is greater than current models report these findings support the observations that vwcp

consumer services which can reflect human s direct and indirect utilization of water resources allan 1998 research in vw modeling has also developed additional concepts like water footprint wf which is used to describe vw contained in the product consumption activities of individuals and groups or regions including detailed descriptions of green water rainwater in soil blue water water in water bodies and grey water water consumed for diluting and purifying sewage hoekstra et al 2011 liao et al 2020 analyzing the consumption or transportation of vw and then control of virtual water through management orders or trades namely the vw strategy vws is considered by researchers to be as important as controlling the consumption and transportation of real water schendel et al 2007 horlemann neubert 2007 recently there have been studies examining the ideal scenario optimizations of vw schwarz et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 xu et al 2020 further some researchers have found that for water embodied in products conceptual modelling of vw or wf is not enough to encompass the differences caused by water resource endowments in different regions this accounting dilemma is similar to the concepts of absolute advantage and comparative advantage in economics hoekstra et al 2012 zhao et al 2015 liao et al 2020 water resources endowments have similar characteristics to other in situ resources that is the difficulty and cost of trans regional transportation and transaction are high which must be considered in vw management for example although some water deficient areas seem to import a large number of vw products from water rich areas they are also using their precious water resources to produce products for export higher net output that is exporting vw to the outside world morillo et al 2015 wichelns 2017 zhi et al 2018 therefore the plan of alleviating the pressure of water resources in water shortage areas through this kind of trade or water transfer sometimes fails which is not conducive to the efficient play of the water transfer function of vws another potential problem the water shortage area may import vw from another water shortage area which is equivalent to the former transferring its pressure of water resource limitation to the latter from the overall perspective of the whole social system it may not be efficient but only cause pressure transfer or pressure leakage which is similar with carbon transfer or carbon leakage in the energy field to avoid reducing greenhouse gas emissions chandrakumar et al 2020 in addition the lack of consideration of endowment value in the calculation of vw or wf is not conducive to the establishment of a fair market oriented vw trading mechanism in the background of a green economy producers and managers in different regions need to know the value of sectoral vw in order to price and negotiate trade for a stable vw transport agreement ridoutt pfister 2010 zhao et al 2018 in view of these problems researchers have put forward a conceptual model calculating vw or wf includes not only how much water is used in the production life cycle but also the value of the water to the local water resources network in other words pressure of the vw or wf on local water resources should be considered some scholars have put forward an improved index of vw virtual scarce water vsw which adds a water intake index to the model and calculates the ratio of regional water intake to the total amount of water resources ridoutt pfister 2010 lenzen et al 2013 thus vsw has a function to describe the pressure of vw usage on local water resources and enables meaningful comparisons between regions with different levels of internal and external water scarcity yano et al 2015 wang et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 the vsw to a certain extent describes the water resource value of vw products in different regions however alone it is not complete because it considers water resource value from the ratio of human water

landscapes is a serious problem that cannot be ignored hoekstra et al 2012 harwood et al 2018 richter et al 2020 thus total water consumption cannot or should not be controlled by a product orientated society therefore the true pressure on water resources or the real value of vw is more serious than a vsw model would describe on one hand it may underestimate water resources pressure with seemingly water rich regions overestimating water supply capacity and then neglect water requirements e g ecological water demand another perspective it may overestimate the degree of water scarcity in some regions which could limit acceptable internal consumption or export to help other regions therefore it is necessary to improve the calculation method and evaluate the impact or value of wf accurately and comprehensively this study provides an improved indicator model for the common vsw which is named as virtual water for comprehensive water pressures vwcp the new vwcp model contains an improved water stress index and a comparison between the amount of water intake of humans and regional availability of water resources the new model includes consideration of ecological water demand aesthetic landscape water demand shipping water demand unusable flood water and finally human water demand to describe the footprint effect that vwcp flows within intermediate products in industrial chains in the economic sectors and finally converges into the final products this study constructs an input output io model which builds on recent researches in the field of vw chen et al 2012 chen and chen 2013 han et al 2017 han et al 2018 wu et al 2019 in order to verify the effectiveness of this vwcp the pearl river basin prb and haihe river basin hrb in china are studied the former is generally recognized as a basin with abundant water while the latter is recognized as a basin with a water deficit hrwc 2019 prwc 2020 the new model calculates the vwcp of regional products and compares the results to the vw and vsw calculated by other models 2 methodology and material 2 1 methodology 2 1 1 water pressure index calculation in this study a deduction calculation method was introduced to calculate the available quantity of water resources and associated comprehensive pressures of water usage in the study areas this method is conducive to adding various new influencing factors obtained from model development and easy to transform to meet actual management needs jiménez et al 1998 koshida et al 2015 xu et al 2019 jia et al 2020 based on the total amount of water resources the available amount of water in the basin can be obtained by deducting the ecological water demand in the river unusable water in the flood season navigable water demand aesthetic water demand and engineering transfer out water with eliminating the duplicate parts between the previous items wang et al 2006 creei 2014 wwap 2019 the basic formulas are as follows 1 w k w gk w u w r 2 w gk w g σwi where w k is the available amount of regional water resources determined by deduction calculations w gk is the total amount of available surface water resources considering other demands and w u is the total amount of exploitable underground water w r is the repeated calculation amount between the former two w g is the total amount of surface water resources and w i is the ith water demand in the case region i is the number of demands which could be ecological water demand navigation water demand aesthetic water demand unusable flood volume in flood season project transfer out volume e g the south to north water diversion project in china etc and the repeated calculation between the above demands is eliminated in order to reflect the protection of environment and ecology the model

2 1 2 io model for vwcp the vwcp in a region contains the water and its water resource pressures used to produce domestic products and imported products despite the complicated reduction procedure the equations quantifying vwcp of inhabitants by an io method can be written as follows leontief 1941 nansai et al 2003 hendrickson et al 2006 zhi et al 2019 5 w r wy cr t b m 6 tx dx xx where w r the bold figure means vector or matrix unit m3 is the vector of vwcp contained in the final products of the economic system in region r n 1 dimensional vector n is the number of the total economic sectors whose element wy means the volume of vwcp unit m3 in the final product of sector y b is the leontief inverse matrix which comes from an io table and shows output rises in each sector due to one unit increase in final product it could reflect the inter sectoral connections between sectors leontief 1941 hendrickson and horvath 1998 hoekstra and chapagain 2007 m unit chinese yuan cny are the diagonal matrices n n dimensional matrices of the studied final products t is the vector of the direct water coefficient n 1 dimensional matrix whose element tx unit m3 cny represents the volume of water directly used by sector to produce one monetary unit output dx m3 is the total volume of fresh water directly used by sector x xx unit cny is the total output of sector x in this study the vw vsw and vwcp consider water use rather than water consumption china s water resource management generally pays more attention to water use than water consumption zhao et al 2016 icmwrprc 2020 sun et al 2021 to analyze the vwcp in products in a different statistical caliber m in equation 5 can be substituted into the products produced and consumed locally m l exported m e or imported m i in general m in equation 5 is equal to the sum of m l and m e also called producers products in some research while the sum of m l and m i is called consumers products zhi et al 2019 within the vwcp model these specific components can be studied separately thus equation 5 becomes 7 w r i c r t b m i m i m l m e m i where w ri could be the vector of vwcp of local products produced and consumed in the regions vwcpl vwcp of exported products vwcpe and vwcp of imported products vwcpi depending on the specific value of m i representing m l m e or m i the computational model for vw or vsw are similar with vwcp in principle for details see related literature e g feng et al 2014 zhao et al 2015 zhang et al 2020 zheng et al 2020 w vw t b m 8 9 w v s w w i n w g t b m where w vw is the vector of vw and w vsw is the vector of vsw in the studied regions respectively 2 2 study areas in the prb the pearl river is the second largest and third longest river in china there are economically developed megacities such as guangdong and shenzhen in the prb and the water transportation in the basin is highly developed the prb is rich in water resources comprising about 17 of the total national water resources the per capita water in prb is about 4 700 m3 which is equivalent to 1 7 times the average in china however the interannual fluctuations of water resources in the pearl river basin creates potential disasters such as flood drought and seawater intrusion in order to protect the environment prb needs to leave a lot of water resources for ecological maintenance prwc 2020 hrb is the political economic and cultural center of china and holds nearly 10 of the total population it is an important industrial and high tech base and one of the largest agricultural production areas however the hrb is also one of the most water scarce regions in china with only about 1 of the total national water resources to balance this water shortage the region has been importing water from external regions through various water diversion projects although the primary south north water transfer project transfers more than 5 109 m3 of water yearly from the changjiang river basin to hrb there is still serious pressures on water demands in the basin hrwc 2019 at present the shipping function of the whole hrb is basically lost 2 3 data collection in order to ensure timeliness and exclude the uneven impact of coronavirus disease 2019 covid 19 on the economy 2018 was selected as the study year seventeen of the primary economic sectors vwcp in prb and hrb were studied table 1 the national bureau of statistics publishes io tables every five years and the latest available io table is for 2017 dnanbsprc 2019a the 2018 io table data for prb and hrb was calculated from the io table of 2017 with some available economic data from the china statistical yearbook using the biproportionate adjustment method miller and blair 1985 zhi et al 2019 and generating regional io tables grit process jensen et al 1979 zhao et al 2010 feng et al 2012 dnanbsprc 2019b the volume of the products consumed by inhabitants including the consumption of households governments and fixed capital formation exports and imports were also included in the io table the water related data and sectors water coefficients were collected and calculated based on data from the china water resources bulletin 2018 mwrprc 2019 previous studies and reports from the commissions of prb and hrb wang et al 2006 feng et al 2014 hrwc 2019 prwc 2020 following renault 2003 in this study water use only concerns blue water which includes surface water and groundwater since most industrial sectors and services except agriculture in china primarily use blue water the green water which means precipitation and soil moisture was not considered according to previous studies shu et al 2021 zhao et al 2021 agriculture is nearly the only direct user of green water about 67 of its total water use in china and green water can account for more than 50 of the national total water use if green water is contained in calculations it would greatly increase the agricultural vwcp and overwhelm bias results in estimating water use across the different sectors therefore this study does not compare blue water with green water further grey water i e the water that is assumed to assimilate wastewater was also ignored because it is difficult to obtain data for grey water from many sectors this simplification has been generally used in studies on wfs from different regions zhao et al 2015 zhang et al 2020 although green and grey water addition to the model can considered 3 results discussion 3 1 comparison of vw vsw and vwcp in 2018 the total water resources of the prb and hrb were 4 78 1011 m3 and 3 38 1010 m3 respectively fig 1 further the available water resources considering other demands of the prb and hrb were 1 21 1011 m3 and 2 18 1010 m3 respectively that is to say the extractability of water resources in the prb is 25 4 and in the hrb 64 4 this confirms that the prb needs to consider other water demands while the hrb has to allocate more water resources for human use mwrprc 2019 for human water intake in the prb in addition to domestic water 5 43 1010 m3 of the extracted water went into production or service processes and became vw in the final products for the hrb the vw in the final products is 2 58 1010 m3 which is larger than its total water or available water resources hrb has in the past obtained water from other regions through water diversion zhao et al 2015 from the view point of vsw although the products of prb contain more vw they are less valuable than those of the hrb in the sense of water resources scarcity the total vsw of the prb is 9 39 109 m3 while that of the hrb is 2 83 1010 m3 the reason is obvious even though water intake of the prb is higher the total amount of water resources is so high that its water intake index ratio of water intake to total water volume is lower than that of the hrb the former is 0 17 and the latter is 1 10 however from the view point of vwcp the gap in the value of water resources is lower as mentioned above the prb needs to leave more water in the natural system for the other demands such as resist saltwater intrusion shipping demand ecological demand and aesthetic demand the comprehensive water stress index cr in the prb is 68 1 and in the hrb is 170 4 with a total vwcp for the prb of 5 18 1010 m3 which is even higher than that of the hrb 4 40 1010 m3 water resources used in production in prb cannot be underestimated even if in the perspective of scarcity the data also shows that based on the view of vwcp the water stress on the two basins is more serious than vsw described especially for prb where the vwcp is about 552 of vsw although it still has a considerable degree of water resource surplus to describe the vw content of products of the two regions more clearly the intensities of vw vsw and vwcp are compared which means these indicators are contained in one monetary unit product the results are shown in fig 2 products in the prb show higher average vw intensity 3 21 10 3 m3 cny 1 than that of hrb 2 23 10 3 m3 cny 1 but this comparison is not realistic the production technology and value of water resources are not the same for the regions the prb consumers and managers holding abundant water resources have no motivation to improve water saving production technology and consumption will not threaten its water protection or sustainable development the average vsw intensity in the prb is 5 56 10 4 m3 cny 1 which is much lower than that of hrb 2 44 10 3 m3 cny 1 vsw could be treated as the vw in products of the hrb being more valuable than the prb however this comparative advantage of hrb will shrink in the view of vwcp intensity which is 3 02 10 3 m3 cny 1 for prb and 3 80 10 3 m3 cny 1 for hrb considering the comprehensive water resources demand the value of vw i e vwcp in the products of prb has been improved this result is consistent with the opinions of water resources management departments wu et al 2020 icmwrprc 2020 it should be noticed that the above vw vsw and vwcp are limited to water scarce water contained in locally produced products imported products are not discussed in this section because their vw have an impact on the water resources of their origin rather than on the study areas 3 2 vwcp in different sectors the vwcpl vwcpe and vwcpi of the 17 sectors in prb and hrb are shown in fig 3 for detailed data see supplementary materials in this study it was assumed that imported products contain the same vwcp as domestic products this assumption is made according to the demand driven action of vw created by renault 2003 the vwcp imported by a region can be treated as the volume the region would have used if it had to produce the product itself rather than real water used at production sites for consumers in prb the largest vwcps are from the sectors of agriculture 2 52 1010 m3 59 is imported food including tobacco 7 74 109 m3 59 is imported and electricity 4 99 109 m3 70 is imported for consumers in hrb the largest vwcps are from the sectors of agriculture 3 79 1010 m3 58 is imported food 6 45 109 m3 64 is imported and chemical industry 3 47 109 m3 95 is imported the largest vwcps for producers in prb are from the sectors of agriculture 1 96 1010 m3 48 is exported food 7 35 109 m3 57 is exported and wholesale including retail trade accommodation catering 5 62 109 m3 56 are imported for the producers in hrb the largest vwcps are from the sectors of agriculture 2 63 1010 m3 40 is exported food 5 41 109 m3 57 is exported and textile including clothing leather products 2 46 109 m3 65 is exported these sectors are traditional high water consumption industries or use intermediate products from high water consumption industries e g the food industry uses agricultural raw materials and the consumptions are huge both the prb and the hrb are net import areas of vwcp for the prb only the sectors of textile including clothing leading products machine manufacturing including equipment manufacturing wood including paper and wholesale including retail trade communication catering are net vwcp outflow sectors and all sectors in hrb show net inflow these inflows net imports are related to the economic status of the two basins they are both the locations of super large cities and economic centers beijing shanghai guangzhou and shenzhen which depend on the input of external products prb as an industrial center exports more light and heavy industrial products than imports but it cannot offset the high net imports of vwcp in other sectors especially in agriculture and electricity the vwcpi of hrb is large and even close to or higher than local products in some sectors vwcpi indicates the pressure of water resources in hrb has exceeded its carrying capacity and spilled out in the form of both transferring water from external regions and importing vw thus the imported vwcp is more valuable to the hrb as a water scarce region and the consumer and producers are willing to import large quantities of vwcp from other regions this is similar to the principle of comparative advantage in economics and is in line with the efficiency principle of economics that the haihe river basin will import products vwcp from areas rich in water resources the vwcp intensities of products produced by the 17 sectors including for local consumption and export in the prb and the hrb is shown in fig 4 in prb the highest vwcp intensities are from the sectors of agriculture 3 39 10 2 m3 cny 1 electricity 1 04 10 2 m3 cny 1 and food 9 98 10 3 m3 cny 1 in hrb the highest vwcp intensities are from the sectors of agriculture 6 66 10 2 m3 cny 1 food 1 07 10 2 m3 cny 1 and textile 8 57 10 3 m3 cny 1 since these data have considered direct water use and indirect water use from intermediate materials these sectors should improve both direct water use process and material efficiency to save water zhi et al 2018 in general the vwcp intensity of agriculture is highest in both regions followed by manufacturing sectors and the service sectors is generally low the agricultural vwcp intensity of the hrb is significantly higher than that of prb because the high water consumption of agriculture makes the impacts of water pressure significant the differences of vwcp intensity in other sectors of the two regions is much smaller than that in agriculture and the prb and hrb have separate vwcp intensities in different sectors 4 conclusions compared with previous vw and svw studies the vwcp and its model provides an evaluation basis for water contained in products while considering some water should be left in the local environment which improves the environmental ethics and social ethics in the model analysis this study highlights the severity of water resources pressure in hrb which is consistent with the water resources bulletin in this basin icmwrprc 2020 although the prb has a large amount of water the regions ecosystem is complex and the water demand for landscape and navigation is significant therefore the vwcp shows that although the pressure on water resources in the prb is not as serious as the hrb it is equivalent to 552 of the severity which is more serious than generally believed managers and stakeholders should be more careful when planning water use or diverting water to other areas whether it s physical water or vw similar with svw the vwcp enables standardized comparisons between the vw from regions with different water resource endowments for example if the two regions bargain or negotiate on water resources compensation the products from hrb should be valued higher or the third party buyers should choose more affordable products in the prb from the perspective of water resources however in addition to the vw content and the scarcity of water resources the trade of goods through a vw carrier is also affected by economic political cultural and other factors zhi et al 2018 sun et al 2021 thus the game of vw trade between regions is a more complex process and the specific implementation method needs more comprehensive research under the directive of social science this model relies on statistical data but at present it is rare to find current io trade data between different regions in china so models can not accurately track the immediate flow of vwcp between two study areas or with other regions moreover the accuracy of the model is affected by the io table including other statistical data and sometimes approximate calculations are almost inevitable for instance the aesthetic water demand in hrb is ignored in this model because the basin has lost shipping function for a many years due to water shortage this study found that the data error in io tables from several regions of china is too large and does not conform to general economic law and these regions are not used as case areas at the same time we suggest that official statistical data should be used carefully and statistical work with additional quality control and assurance could further improve realistic models for vsw assessments in future studies some alternative economic mathematics assessment methods could be used to replace the io module of the model to obtain the results of different dimensions for example the life cycle assessment lca method is suitable for studying vwcp of a specific sector enterprise or product hoekstra et al 2011

the south to north water diversion project in china etc and the repeated calculation between the above demands is eliminated in order to reflect the protection of environment and ecology the model makes a final correction to the calculated w k 3 w k2 min w k w o 4 c r w i n w k 2 where w k2 is the amount of available water resources after correction w o is the available amount of water

2 1 2 io model for vwcp the vwcp in a region contains the water and its water resource pressures used to produce domestic products and imported products despite the complicated reduction procedure the equations quantifying vwcp of inhabitants by an io method can be written as follows leontief 1941 nansai et al 2003 hendrickson et al 2006 zhi et al 2019 5 w r wy cr t b m 6 tx dx xx where w r the bold figure means vector or matrix unit m3 is the vector of vwcp contained in the final products of the economic system in region r n 1 dimensional vector n is the number of the total economic sectors whose element wy means the volume of vwcp unit m3 in the final product of sector y b is the leontief inverse matrix which comes from an io table and shows output rises in each sector due to one unit

water directly used by sector to produce one monetary unit output dx m3 is the total volume of fresh water directly used by sector x xx unit cny is the total output of sector x in this study the vw vsw and vwcp consider water use rather than water consumption china s water resource management generally pays more attention to water use than water consumption zhao et al 2016 icmwrprc 2020 sun et al 2021 to analyze the vwcp in products in a different statistical caliber m in equation 5 can be substituted into the products produced and consumed locally m l exported m e or imported m i in general m in equation 5 is equal to the sum of m l and m e also called producers products in some research while the sum of m l and m i is called consumers products zhi et al 2019 within the vwcp model these specific components can be studied separately thus equation 5 becomes 7 w r i c r t b m i m i m l m e m i where w ri could be the vector of vwcp of local products produced and consumed in the regions vwcpl vwcp of exported products vwcpe and vwcp of imported products vwcpi depending on the specific value of m i representing m l m e or m i the computational model for vw or vsw are similar with vwcp in principle for details see related literature e g feng et al 2014 zhao et al 2015 zhang et al 2020 zheng et al 2020 w vw t b m 8 9 w v s w w i n w g t b m where w vw is the vector of vw and w vsw is the vector of vsw in the studied regions respectively 2 2 study areas in the prb the pearl river is the second largest and third longest river in china there are economically developed megacities such as guangdong and shenzhen in the prb and the water transportation in the basin is highly developed the prb is rich in water resources comprising about 17 of the total national water resources the per capita water in prb is about 4 700 m3 which is equivalent to 1 7 times the average in china however the interannual fluctuations of water resources in the pearl river basin creates potential disasters such as flood drought and seawater intrusion in order to protect the environment prb needs to leave a lot of water resources for ecological maintenance prwc 2020 hrb is the political economic and cultural center of china and holds nearly 10 of the total population it is an important industrial and high tech base and one of the largest agricultural production areas however the hrb is also one of the most water scarce regions in china with only about 1 of the total national water resources to balance this water shortage the region has been importing water from external regions through various water diversion projects although the primary south north water transfer project transfers more than 5 109 m3 of water yearly from the changjiang river basin to hrb there is still serious pressures on water demands in the basin hrwc 2019 at present the shipping function of the whole hrb is basically lost 2 3 data collection in order to ensure timeliness and exclude the uneven impact of coronavirus disease 2019 covid 19 on the economy 2018 was selected as the study year seventeen of the primary economic sectors vwcp in prb and hrb were studied table 1 the national bureau of statistics publishes io tables every five years and the latest available io table is for 2017 dnanbsprc 2019a the 2018 io table data for prb and hrb was calculated from the io table of 2017 with some available economic data from the china statistical yearbook using the biproportionate adjustment method miller and blair 1985 zhi et al 2019 and generating regional io tables grit process jensen et al 1979 zhao et al 2010 feng et al 2012 dnanbsprc 2019b the volume of the products consumed by inhabitants including the consumption of households governments and fixed capital formation exports and imports were also included in the io table the water related data and sectors water coefficients were collected and calculated based on data from the china water resources bulletin 2018 mwrprc 2019 previous studies and reports from the commissions of prb and hrb wang et al 2006 feng et al 2014 hrwc 2019 prwc 2020 following renault 2003 in this study water use only concerns blue water which includes surface water and groundwater since most industrial sectors and services except agriculture in china primarily use blue water the green water which means precipitation and soil moisture was not considered according to previous studies shu et al 2021 zhao et al 2021 agriculture is nearly the only direct user of green water about 67 of its total water use in china and green water can account for more than 50 of the national total water use if green water is contained in calculations it would greatly increase the agricultural vwcp and overwhelm bias results in estimating water use across the different sectors therefore this study does not compare blue water with green water further grey water i e the water that is assumed to assimilate wastewater was also ignored because it is difficult to obtain data for grey water from many sectors this simplification has been generally used in studies on wfs from different regions zhao et al 2015 zhang et al 2020 although green and grey water addition to the model can considered 3 results discussion 3 1 comparison of vw vsw and vwcp in 2018 the total water resources of the prb and hrb were 4 78 1011 m3 and 3 38 1010 m3 respectively fig 1 further the available water resources considering other demands of the prb and hrb were 1 21 1011 m3 and 2 18 1010 m3 respectively that is to say the extractability of water resources in the prb is 25 4 and in the hrb 64 4 this confirms that the prb needs to consider other water demands while the hrb has to allocate more water resources for human use mwrprc 2019 for human water intake in the prb in addition to domestic water 5 43 1010 m3 of the extracted water went into production or service processes and became vw in the final products for the hrb the vw in the final products is 2 58 1010 m3 which is larger than its total water or available water resources hrb has in the past obtained water from other regions through water diversion zhao et al 2015 from the view point of vsw although the products of prb contain more vw they are less valuable than those of the hrb in the sense of water resources scarcity the total vsw of the prb is 9 39 109 m3 while that of the hrb is 2 83 1010 m3 the reason is obvious even though water intake of the prb is higher the total amount of water resources is so high that its water intake index ratio of water intake to total water volume is lower than that of the hrb the former is 0 17 and the latter is 1 10 however from the view point of vwcp the gap in the value of water resources is lower as mentioned above the prb needs to leave more water in the natural system for the other demands such as resist saltwater intrusion shipping demand ecological demand and aesthetic demand the comprehensive water stress index cr in the prb is 68 1 and in the hrb is 170 4 with a total vwcp for the prb of 5 18 1010 m3 which is even higher than that of the hrb 4 40 1010 m3 water resources used in production in prb cannot be underestimated even if in the perspective of scarcity the data also shows that based on the view of vwcp the water stress on the two basins is more serious than vsw described especially for prb where the vwcp is about 552 of vsw although it still has a considerable degree of water resource surplus to describe the vw content of products of the two regions more clearly the intensities of vw vsw and vwcp are compared which means these indicators are contained in one monetary unit product the results are shown in fig 2 products in the prb show higher average vw intensity 3 21 10 3 m3 cny 1 than that of hrb 2 23 10 3 m3 cny 1 but this comparison is not realistic the production technology and value of water resources are not the same for the regions the prb consumers and managers holding abundant water resources have no motivation to improve water saving production technology and consumption will not threaten its water protection or sustainable development the average vsw intensity in the prb is 5 56 10 4 m3 cny 1 which is much lower than that of hrb 2 44 10 3 m3 cny 1 vsw could be treated as the vw in products of the hrb being more valuable than the prb however this comparative advantage of hrb will shrink in the view of vwcp intensity which is 3 02 10 3 m3 cny 1 for prb and 3 80 10 3 m3 cny 1 for hrb considering the comprehensive water resources demand the value of vw i e vwcp in the products of prb has been improved this result is consistent with the opinions of water resources management departments wu et al 2020 icmwrprc 2020 it should be noticed that the above vw vsw and vwcp are limited to water scarce water contained in locally produced products imported products are not discussed in this section because their vw have an impact on the water resources of their origin rather than on the study areas 3 2 vwcp in different sectors the vwcpl vwcpe and vwcpi of the 17 sectors in prb and hrb are shown in fig 3 for detailed data see supplementary materials in this study it was assumed that imported products contain the same vwcp as domestic products this assumption is made according to the demand driven action of vw created by renault 2003 the vwcp imported by a region can be treated as the volume the region would have used if it had to produce the product itself rather than real water used at production sites for consumers in prb the largest vwcps are from the sectors of agriculture 2 52 1010 m3 59 is imported food including tobacco 7 74 109 m3 59 is imported and electricity 4 99 109 m3 70 is imported for consumers in hrb the largest vwcps are from the sectors of agriculture 3 79 1010 m3 58 is imported food 6 45 109 m3 64 is imported and chemical industry 3 47 109 m3 95 is imported the largest vwcps for producers in prb are from the sectors of agriculture 1 96 1010 m3 48 is exported food 7 35 109 m3 57 is exported and wholesale including retail trade accommodation catering 5 62 109 m3 56 are imported for the producers in hrb the largest vwcps are from the sectors of agriculture 2 63 1010 m3 40 is exported food 5 41 109 m3 57 is exported and textile including clothing leather products 2 46 109 m3 65 is exported these sectors are traditional high water consumption industries or use intermediate products from high water consumption industries e g the food industry uses agricultural raw materials and the consumptions are huge both the prb and the hrb are net import areas of vwcp for the prb only the sectors of textile including clothing leading products machine manufacturing including equipment manufacturing wood including paper and wholesale including retail trade communication catering are net vwcp outflow sectors and all sectors in hrb show net inflow these inflows net imports are related to the economic status of the two basins they are both the locations of super large cities and economic centers beijing shanghai guangzhou and shenzhen which depend on the input of external products prb as an industrial center exports more light and heavy industrial products than imports but it cannot offset the high net imports of vwcp in other sectors especially in agriculture and electricity the vwcpi of hrb is large and even close to or higher than local products in some sectors vwcpi indicates the pressure of water resources in hrb has exceeded its carrying capacity and spilled out in the form of both transferring water from external regions and importing vw thus the imported vwcp is more valuable to the hrb as a water scarce region and the consumer and producers are willing to import large quantities of vwcp from other regions this is similar to the principle of comparative advantage in economics and is in line with the efficiency principle of economics that the haihe river basin will import products vwcp from areas rich in water resources the vwcp intensities of products produced by the 17 sectors including for local consumption and export in the prb and the hrb is shown in fig 4 in prb the highest vwcp intensities are from the sectors of agriculture 3 39 10 2 m3 cny 1 electricity 1 04 10 2 m3 cny 1 and food 9 98 10 3 m3 cny 1 in hrb the highest vwcp intensities are from the sectors of agriculture 6 66 10 2 m3 cny 1 food 1 07 10 2 m3 cny 1 and textile 8 57 10 3 m3 cny 1 since these data have considered direct water use and indirect water use from intermediate materials these sectors should improve both direct water use process and material efficiency to save water zhi et al 2018 in general the vwcp intensity of agriculture is highest in both regions followed by manufacturing sectors and the service sectors is generally low the agricultural vwcp intensity of the hrb is significantly higher than that of prb because the high water consumption of agriculture makes the impacts of water pressure significant the differences of vwcp intensity in other sectors of the two regions is much smaller than that in agriculture and the prb and hrb have separate vwcp intensities in different sectors 4 conclusions compared with previous vw and svw studies the vwcp and its model provides an evaluation basis for water contained in products while considering some water should be left in the local environment which improves the environmental ethics and social ethics in the model analysis this study highlights the severity of water resources pressure in hrb which is consistent with the water resources bulletin in this basin icmwrprc 2020 although the prb has a large amount of water the regions ecosystem is complex and the water demand for landscape and navigation is significant therefore the vwcp shows that although the pressure on water resources in the prb is not as serious as the hrb it is equivalent to 552 of the severity which is more serious than generally believed managers and stakeholders should be more careful when planning water use or diverting water to other areas whether it s physical water or vw similar with svw the vwcp enables standardized comparisons between the vw from regions with different water resource endowments for example if the two regions bargain or negotiate on water resources compensation the products from hrb should be valued higher or the third party buyers should choose more affordable products in the prb from the perspective of water resources however in addition to the vw content and the scarcity of water resources the trade of goods through a vw carrier is also affected by economic political cultural and other factors zhi et al 2018 sun et al 2021 thus the game of vw trade between regions is a more complex process and the specific implementation method needs more comprehensive research under the directive of social science this model relies on statistical data but at present it is rare to find current io trade data between different regions in china so models can not accurately track the immediate flow of vwcp between two study areas or with other regions moreover the accuracy of the model is affected by the io table including other statistical data and sometimes approximate calculations are almost inevitable for instance the aesthetic water demand in hrb is ignored in this model because the basin has lost shipping function for a many years due to water shortage this study found that the data error in io tables from several regions of china is too large and does not conform to general economic law and these regions are not used as case areas at the same time we suggest that official statistical data should be used carefully and statistical work with additional quality control and assurance could further improve realistic models for vsw assessments in future studies some alternative economic mathematics assessment methods could be used to replace the io module of the model to obtain the results of different dimensions for example the life cycle assessment lca method is suitable for studying vwcp of a specific sector enterprise or product hoekstra et al 2011

3506,water inrush is a typical geological disaster in the process of underground mining it is crucial to depict potential water inrush areas for mining safety in this study mining activity in dongtan coal mine is under the water inrush threat from deep ordovician limestone confined aquifers tomographic water releasing tests and simultaneous successive linear estimator simsle were conducted to characterize aquifer heterogeneity by stimulating hundreds of square kilometers an artificial injection well was firstly introduced to alleviate the influence from identified recharge channels the estimated parameter distributions indicated that the study area was divided into two separately hydrogeological compartments transmissivity t and storativity s in the north were relatively higher due to water conducting structures and more attention should be paid to this region which may develop into water inrush incidents the southern area is occupied with lower t and s which indicated relatively worse flow conditions auxiliary drawdown recovery data borehole chemistry variations drilling fluid losses and existing geological features further confirmed the estimated parameter distributions in the end we concluded that hydraulic tomography technique ht could obtain aquifer parameter information in large scales and provide supports to formulate reasonably effective water prevention and control schemes before mining deep coal seams keywords parameter estimation heterogeneity water inrush hydraulic tomography dongtan coal mine 1 introduction coal is an important type of energy to power generation and industrial production in china even today with the rapid development of green energy coal consumption still accounts for more than 50 of the total energy consumption china energy big data report 2021 nowadays coal mining has expanded to deep coal bearing strata which directly increases the risk of mining activity especially water inrush incidents one of the most threatening disasters in coal mining have caused tremendous property losses and casualties liu and cao 2011 zhou et al 2020 in order to prevent this disaster it is therefore crucial to find an effective method to predict possible water inrush locations the prediction of water inrush locations in underground mines should take into account the permeability of adjacent strata and hydraulic pressure of confined aquifer wang and park 2003 accurate characterization of aquifer parameters i e transmissivity t and storativity s has been a technological challenge for decades hydraulic tomography ht proposed by gottlieb and dietrich 1995 serves as an effective approach to alleviate this problem during ht many discharge or recharge head data are collected by progressively releasing or injecting water from discharging boreholes and measuring head responses from observation boreholes these data are inversely modelled to characterize aquifer heterogeneity in high resolution kitanidis 1995 yeh et al 1995 yeh et al 1996 over the past two decades many research groups have contributed to the advancement of interpretation methods for example sequential successive linear estimator proposed by yeh and liu 2000 pilot point method by lavenue and de marsily 2001 travel time based approaches from vasco et al 2000 and brauchler et al 2003 and bayesian geostatistical inverse protocol from fienen et al 2008 those who are interested in these methods are encouraged to refer to several review papers about inverse problems in subsurface hydrology for details such as carrera et al 2005 mclaughlin and townley 1996 and zhou et al 2014 the robust performance of ht aided by successive linear estimator sle in revealing aquifer heterogeneity has been demonstrated through small scale laboratory and field experiments e g berg and illman 2011 2012 brauchler et al 2007 illman et al 2015 luo et al 2017 zhao and illman 2017 zhao et al 2016 despite encouraging results these based on data collected synthetically or highly controlled conditions were often questioned for the real world field tests many large scale field experiments e g kuhlman et al 2008 illman et al 2009 berg and illman 2015 wang et al 2017 zha et al 2019 were therefore carried out to confirm the effectiveness of the ht technique in the absence of controlled conditions due to the ability to capture detailed characterization of aquifer heterogeneity ht has been employed to the accurate prediction of groundwater flow contaminant transport and geological structure survey illman 2014 illman et al 2010 2012 zha et al 2017 in parallel hydrogeological issues of future prediction like underground coal mine exploitations also rely on the accurate characterization of aquifer heterogeneity especially mao et al 2018 exploited inrush incident in coalfield as an active stimulus in ht for mapping geologic structures over a large area by taking advantages of commonly performed water releasing tests provided by underground confining conditions xu et al 2002 li et al 2010 liu et al 2020 interpreted sequential water releasing tests aided by ht techniques to obtain high resolution k and ss distributions and accurately identified the water hazard locations wang et al 2021 combined puming tests and wide field electromagnetic method to explore the preferential flowpaths of water inrush in coal mine areas the ability of ht technique for predicting water hazards over dozens of kilometers was investigated in this study three tomographic water releasing tests were designed to obtain the hydraulic parameters in the deep ordovician limestone aquifer at the dongtan coal mine simultaneous successive linear estimator simsle method was adopted to interpret transient water releasing tests data for obtaining a heterogeneity characterization drawdown recovery data drilling fluid losses groundwater chemistry data and geologic features were then employed to verify the estimated parameter distributions in the end we confirmed the effectiveness of using ht technique to depict aquifer heterogeneity during tomographic water releasing tests 2 description of study area 2 1 sketch map of dongtan coal mine north china coalfield is one of china s most important energy bases the dongtan underground coal mine is part of the north china coal field located in the southwest of shandong province the coal mine stretches 12 5 km north to south and 4 8 km east to west spanning 59 96 km2 fig 1 on the east and northeast sides it is bordered by impermeable yishan fault and the ziyang fault the southwest the south and the northwest are adjacent to baodian minefield nantun minefield and xinglongzhuang minefield respectively the ground elevation is between 42 46 m and 54 58 m with gentle folds and some fracture structures distributed and the mine receives groundwater recharge from the north and west directions 2 2 hydrogeological background the strata of dongtan coal mine are quaternary q jurassic j permian p carboniferous c and ordovician o from top to bottom fig 2 illustrates the geological sequences the coal bearing strata are the shanxi and taiyuan formations with a combined average thickness of 300 m currently the deep coal mining of no 16 and no 17 coal seams namely lower coal group has emerged due to the exhaustion of shallow coal resources represented by the no 3 coal seam namely upper coal group of shanxi formation there are several aquifers and aquitards related to the mining of lower coal group the carboniferous taiyuan and benxi formations consist of 18 layers of limestone with a total thickness of approximate 300 m denoted as l1 l2 and l18 wu and jin 1995 and there are several interbedding aquitards consisting of mudstone within these limestone aquifers some of these limestone aquifers such as the l10 of the taiyuan formation and the l13 and l14 of the benxi formation may affect lower coal group mining the deep ordovician system may threat mining safety as well the top two formations majiagou formation o2 and yeli formation o1 with about 450 750 m in thickness the upper surface of the o2 aquifer has gone long term weathering and fissures were well developed chen et al 2013 but there is little information regarding the o1 aquifer because the current geological boreholes are not drilled to its depth li et al 2009 based on the strata system if the aquitards surrounding the coal seams remain intact hydraulic connections between aquifers and coal mine may be limited however if the water conducting structures impair the integrity of the aquitards the probability of water inrush occurrences would rise dramatically especially in regions where water conducting fissures and faults have developed wang and park 2003 apart from the aforementioned geological strata information the hydraulic heads in these confining layers are strongly related to water inrush incidences the magnitudes of hydraulic head in aquifers l10 l13 l14 and o2 are all higher than the elevation of lower coal group at approximately 745 m li et al 2009 which are shown in the last column of fig 2 especially the o2 aquifer exerts a high hydraulic pressure up to 10 mpa on the floor of lower coal seams furthermore the l10 layer is located directly above the no 16 coal seam and just has few local water rich areas with an average thickness of 5 m this can be seen from the higher values of water yields around borehole l13 dx1 o2 dx6 and o2 dx9 in table s1 of electronic supplementary materials esm however these local water yields in the l10 can be drained out since they belong to static water storage besides the two limestone aquifers l13 and l14 have even less water yields therefore l10 l13 and l14 pose little threats to the lower group coal mining on the whole the o2 aquifer has larger thickness and extreme higher confining pressure zhang 2005 qiao et al 2019 and hence it represents the main water inrush threat to mining activity and the target aquifer of this study 3 methodology we set up three tomographic water releasing tests on the target aquifer to characterize its hydraulic parameter distributions geostatistical based simsle algorithm was employed to interpret the head responses xiang et al 2009 mao et al 2013b in simsle the distributions of hydraulic parameters could be estimated by simultaneously interpreting the head responses generated from stimulating the aquifer at multiple locations avoiding the influence of the order of releasing tests on parameter estimation the joint inversion considered the information from all tests and synthesized them into a unifiedly best unbiased parameter estimations here we provide a brief description of simsle method detailed algorithm of simsle is available in xiang et al 2009 firstly the natural logarithm of transmissivity t and storativity s ln t and ln s are treated as stationary stochastic processes based on the information of geological statistics the unconditional mean value unconditional variance value correlation scales and spatial variation function of the hydraulic parameters of the aquifer are given a prior secondly cokriging method with head measurements and hydraulic parameters at known positions is used to estimate the overall initial distributions of hydraulic parameters yeh and liu 2000 the interpolated initial hydraulic parameter fields are brought into the governing equation to yield simulated head distributions and then the predicted hydraulic parameters are iteratively corrected using the difference between the simulated and observed heads to fully exploit the non linear connection between heads and hydraulic parameters until the head difference is less than allowable criteria the model reaches convergence and the hydraulic parameters are the final estimated results moreover the diagonal elements of the residual covariance which are updated at each iteration reflect the uncertainty of estimated parameters 4 field tests 4 1 distribution of boreholes a total of 32 boreholes were deployed for water releasing tests in the o2 aquifer and they were evenly distributed throughout the study area fig 3 there were 25 boreholes drilled into o2 aquifer for about 100 m three boreholes drilled into l10 i e l10 dx3 l10 d1 and l10 d2 one borehole drilled into l13 i e l13 dx1 and three boreholes drilled into l14 i e l14 d1 l14 dx2 and l14 dx3 all boreholes were equipped with automatic water level monitoring system during the drilling process the water yields of all underground boreholes starting with dx and the drilling fluid losses of all surface boreholes starting with d were recorded among that the boreholes o2 dx6 o2 dx9 o2 dx4 o2 dx5 and o2 dx7 with high water yields served as the discharging boreholes during water releasing tests those seven boreholes distributed in l10 l13 and l14 were used to inspect the hydraulic connections between o2 aquifer and these three aquifers 4 2 tomographic water releasing tests as discussed in section 2 2 the o2 aquifer was under artesian condition and therefore three water releasing tests were setup namely stage 1 stage 2 and stage 3 the arrangement of every stage is shown in the table 1 during each stage discharging boreholes released water and recorded flow rates and hydraulic head data were simultaneously observed in all observation boreholes in stage 1 o2 dx6 and o2 dx9 quickly reached a stable total flow rate of about 325 m3 h and then these two discharging boreholes were turned off for 136 h in stage 2 boreholes o2 dx4 o2 dx5 o2 dx7 o2 dx6 and o2 dx9 all started to release water at a total flow rate of 436 5 m3 h after 155 h these five discharging boreholes were turned off for 203 h in stage 3 boreholes o2 dx4 o2 dx5 and o2 dx7 started to release water at about 101 5 m3 h after 121 h these three discharging boreholes were closed for 72 h this releasing arrangement is different from previous sequential water relealsing tests used by liu et al 2020 in the ningtiaota underground coal mine they set up a four stage superimposed water releasing tests by increasing the number of discharging boreholes step by step in other words the discharging boreholes of earlier stage were kept open when later stages started and all discharging boreholes closed at the end of tests drawdowns of later stages superimposed on previous stages the current arrangement was that the later stage was carried out after head recovery from previous stage the head data derived from the current arrangement were more like a classical hydraulic tomography test yeh and liu 2000 4 3 drawdown analysis during field tests noise inevitably corrupted head data due to the influence of the surrounding environment in this paper savitzky golay filter was used to reduce the noise order 1 frame 51 aristodemo et al 2018 this method had proven to be effective for removing high frequency noise while retaining the information of low frequency signals liu et al 2020 fig 4 illustrates the effect of noise reduction for two observation boreholes the red lines represent head fluctuations after removing noise and as expected they retain the trend of head variations during both discharge and recovery periods we then used all the denoised data to plot the drawdown contour maps at the end of each releasing period fig 5 from these figures we could see each water releasing test affected borehole responses locally when boreholes o2 dx6 and o2 dx9 were discharging during stage 1 only the areas around these two boreholes were affected as shown in fig 5a and the drawdown values were the smallest among these three stages when o2 dx4 o2 dx5 and o2 dx7 discharged during stage 3 a larger head perturbation was created in the lower part of fig 5c in the end all these five boreholes were open at the same time during stage 2 the cone of depression propagated to most parts of the domain except the top right corner fig 5b in summary the hydraulic heads gave relatively large responses in the lower part of the domain whereas the top right corner was not sensitive to the water releasing tests as for the seven boreholes located in the adjacent aquifers during stages 1 and 2 l13 dx1 had head responses as quickly as the observation boreholes in the o2 aquifer fig s1 in esm this hinted l13 might have connections with o2 in the vicinity of l13 dx1 the maximum drawdown of l13 dx1 was 26 7 m at the end of stage 1 and 29 5 m at the end of stage 2 which was much larger than observed drawdowns in o2 itself these large drawdown magnitudes further indicated a linkage between these two aquifers additionally l13 dx1 was only 60 m away from the o2 dx6 and therefore the larger magnitude was partially due to the close distance to the water discharging boreholes on the other hand the six boreholes located in l10 and l14 l10 dx3 l10 d1 l10 d2 l14 d1 l14 dx2 and l14 dx3 did not show any drawdown fluctuations corresponding to the water releasing tests even though l13 was in between l10 and l14 spatially l14 may therefore have linkages with o2 as well there was no further drilling data to support this and therefore this linkage was not considered in this study 4 4 analysis of o2 leakage as discussed in the above section there might exist connections between o2 and other aquifers during stage 1 the stable releasing rate from o2 dx6 and o2 dx9 reached 325 m3 h however there were no evident drawdowns for the surrounding observation boreholes such as o2 dx8 and o2 dx10 which were only about 1 km and 3 km away from these two discharging boreholes for one thing it means t and s may be large in regions close to water discharging boreholes but the field information in table s1 refutes this conjecture with low water yield values of 0 42 m3 h 0 16 m3 h 0 50 m3 h in o2 dx2 o2 dx8 and o2 dx10 respectively on the other hand it also means there are additional water sources coming from other aquifers to sustain low drawdown responses in o2 aquifer the existing information in table s1 shows that the water volume in l10 l13 and l14 are not abundant so there must be other water sources based on the hydrogeological information in section 2 2 it most likely comes from deeper parts e g o1 aquifer the amount of recharge from deep aquifer should be estimated based on numerical simulations 5 inverse modeling 5 1 numerical model configuration based on the analysis of geological and hydrogeological conditions a numerical model was established to identify the hydraulic parameters of o2 aquifer the 100 m thick o2 aquifer was conceptualized into a two dimensional structure fig 6 the right and bottom sides were set as no flux boundaries the left and top sides were constant head boundaries at 1000 m the model domain was divided into 40 60 cells and the dimensions of each cell was 300 m 300 m the initial hydraulic head was equal to 1000 m exponential covariance models were assumed to describe the variability of parameters the means of ln t and ln s were calculated with least square method by using head observations during each stage the initial variances of ln t and ln s were 1 0 and 0 5 the correlation scales in and y directions were set as 2000 m we used software vsaft2 to run both forward and inverse modelings yeh et al 1993 http tian hwr arizona edu downloads subsequently we ran simulations for all individual water releasing tests and joint analysis based on this highly parameterized heterogeneous model there were 10 data points along each drawdown curve picked for parameter estimations three to four data points from both early and late times and three additional data points for the intermediate period mao et al 2013a b sun et al 2013 we also discussed the impacts of selection of data on the inversion results by increasing data points of each drawdown curve to 20 and 30 5 2 simulation of vertical recharge as analyzed by the drawdown behaviors in section 4 4 there must be vertical recharge from deeper ordovician aquifer here we chose stage 2 of water releasing tests to estimate vertical recharge we first ran an inversion model without any recharge fig 7 a and 7b shows the estimate results an obvious feature is the occurrence of a large area with abnormal high t and s zones in the top right corner this is a direct reflection of low drawdowns in the region and these highly permeable and water rich areas can quickly provide enough water to maintain a lower drawdown this is different from the wrong assignment of boundary type discussed by daranond et al 2020 liu et al 2020 the estimated t and s values are as high as 1200 m2 h and 0 0005 which are two orders larger than the rest of the domain we believe this is caused by ignoring vertical recharge unfortunately the precise position of the recharge and its magnitude were unclear to simplify this problem we assumed it was a point recharge based on the small drawdowns in the top right area this point must locate in the same area we selected three candidate points in the top right area to represent possible recharge locations and they were symbolized by cross signs in fig 7a besides the trial and error approach was used to determine the magnitude of recharge by assuming a proportional rate to the total water releasing discharge the magnitude was set as 50 70 and 90 of the total discharge of northern discharging boreholes o2 dx6 and o2 dx9 6 results 6 1 determination of vertical recharge here we use the example of adding an injection borehole between o2 dx6 and o2 dx9 injection 1 in stage 2 as an illustration the estimated parameters are shown in fig 8 with a recharge rate of 50 of the total discharge the area with extreme large t and s shrinks fig 8a and d the maximum value of t changes from 1200 m2 h to 480 m2 h and s varies from 0 0005 to 0 0003 the increase of vertical recharge means the decrease of discharge from o2 aquifer which leads to the decrease of the magnitude of estimated t and s however the abnormal parameters still occupy the top right area and the parameter distributions in other places does not vary much with the added vertical recharge most areas are under initial parameters values and the bottom left part is dominant by observation boreholes in this region with the increase of vertical recharge to 70 of the discharging rate the abnormal areas continue to shrink fig 8b and e once the recharge amount reaches 90 of the total discharging rate the estimated t and s values show reasonable distributions compared to the rest of the domain there are still high t and s areas in the top right parts but they are locally distributed compared to the estimated parameters without any vertical recharge fig 7 the pattern of parameter distributions does not change with the addition of vertical recharge the domain shows two distinct hydrogeological compartments the bottom left part is mainly controlled by the three water discharging boreholes o2 dx4 o2 dx5 and o2 dx7 and surrounding observation boreholes the top right part receives influence from the two water discharging boreholes o2 dx6 and o2 dx9 we acknowledge the estimated amount and location of the vertical recharge are merely a rough approximation to the true field however it does not change the pattern of hydraulic parameter distributions we therefore will use this estimated value a recharge amount 90 of water releasing rate for the following inverse modeling for the other two potential locations the estimated parameter distributions fig s2 and s3 in esm also show two hydrogeological compartments and the top right abnormal areas continue to shrink with the increase of vertical recharge this trend is consistent with the results from the first location but due to closer distance to contant head boundary the 90 recharge value does not render estimated t and s values reasonable distributions in the top right and an increase of recharge is needed 6 2 estimated results from individual test the estimated results for each individual test are illustrated in fig 9 the matching between simulated and observed heads of each stage is shown in fig 10 and the coefficients of determination r2 for all three tests are close to 1 0 from the parameter distributions we find that t and s are relatively small in the bottom left with locally high t areas on the top right part it shows a high t area the s estimates in three stages indicate less details than t estimates this may be attributed to the fact that high cross correlation between head and storativity is limited to a narrow region between discharging and observation boreholes wu et al 2005 for both t and s the results from stage 2 and stage 3 are rather similar except the top right part this is due to both tests used the same water discharging boreholes in the bottom left part i e o2 dx4 o2 dx5 and o2 dx7 for the top right part there is not enough drawdown information to characterize this region during stage 3 and therefore estimated parameters are close to initial values and present a smooth distribution during stage 1 the main stimulus is from discharging boreholes o2 dx6 and o2 dx9 due to the addition of vertical recharges an effective smaller releasing rate induced lower drawdown responses which only propagates to short distances away from discharging boreholes therefore only the parameter information close to these boreholes is discovered 6 3 jointly estimated results the estimated results from joint inversion of three tests are provided in fig 11 the fitting results of the simulated and the observed heads of three stages are shown in fig 12 the corresponding residual variances distributions of estimated parameters are shown in fig s4 we note that obtained t and s tomograms reveal similar pattern to the inversion results of stage 2 both parameters show two relatively independent hydrogeological compartments i e a top right part and a bottom left part this similarity is caused by using all five discharging boreholes during stage 2 which has more influence on the joint inversion results there are also differences by incorporating more datasets compared with fig 9b and e by using data only from stage 2 the high t area in the top right areas moves towards right the high t zone on the left becomes more evident there is no much variation between estimated specific storage values in general t and s tomograms show positive correlation according to the residual variances shown in fig s4 the residual variances are low in areas with boreholes as well as between boreholes which suggests that the parameter estimations in these areas are more accurate than in areas where data are scarce close to boundaries 7 discussion 7 1 impact of data points selection would the results be different if we change the amount of observation data points as pointed out by luo et al 2020 there were no noticeable improvements for the prediction of independent pumping test data by including more observation points with longer simulation durations for domain size here we investigated the influence by adding more observation data in stage 2 and the results are displayed in fig s5 we find that increasing the number of observational data points along each drawdown curve does not produce substantial differences in the inverted t and s and the derived patterns are similar as a result high precision parameter distributions could be obtained even with a small amount of hydraulic data which already captures the general trend of drawdowns 7 2 comparison between predicted and observed drawdowns the estimated parameter fields were examined through comparing predicted heads with observed heads during recovery periods fig 13 the recovery periods are 136 h 203 h 72 h drawdown data were evenly chosen from the recovery curves every 10 h we can see that most data pairs are scattered along the 45 degree line especially larger drawdowns in the early recovery period due to negative values in observation drawdowns the predictions of smaller drawdowns in the later period lack accuracy the occurrence of negative values of drawdown may be attributed to water consumption from o2 aquifer in coal mine production which is not considered in the current modeling 7 3 verification by drilling fluid losses the drilling fluid losses calculated by water supply and return in drilling process could reflect the strength of rock permeability liu et al 2014 used drilling fluid loss as a quick method to evaluate transmissivity of clay layers the locations of surface boreholes and the amount of drilling fluid losses are marked in fig 14 the values of fluid losses in o2 d1 o2 d2 o2 d3 o2 d4 o2 d5 were 1 11 m3 h 0 7 m3 h 0 84 m3 h 1 5 m3 h 0 18 m3 h and the drilling fluid was all lost in o2 d7 in the bottom left region we find that the amount of drilling fluid losses at the position o2 d4 o2 d7 are larger than the surrounding boreholes which means there may be more fissures and water conductive channels this is consistent with the presence of local high t regions in fig 14a since there is no clear connection between water conducting structures and the aquifer water yields the amount of drilling fluid losses does not match the s distribution in fig 14b 7 4 verification with groundwater chemistry data water samples from underground boreholes and four surface boreholes in o2 aquifer were collected by qiao et al 2013 the magnitudes of total dissolved solids tds values are displayed in fig 15 the tds range is 1295 7 mg l 3554 5 mg l with significant differences we know that groundwater with higher tds reflects the poor local runoff conditions xing et al 2015 zhao and lu 2020 due to the slow flow rate of groundwater leaching is more sufficient and soluble salts are easy to accumulate in groundwater the top right areas with lower tds have better runoff conditions and abundant recharge from surrounding area or deep recharge channles this is reflected in the distributions of hydraulic parameters with high t and s the region around bottom left discharging boreholes with higher tds has relatively poor runoff conditions corresponding to the lower t and s values overall these chemistry data are consistent with our inversion results but ht results provide more continous hydraulic parameter distributions 7 5 verification by geological structures zhao et al 2016 showed that ht can successfully map site specific geologic features at kilometer scale field we therefore overlapped major geological faults in grey lines and folds in brown lines with hydraulic parameters fig 16 a as following our analysis in mao et al 2018 we can see that those high t zones are consistent with the general patterns of fracture lineaments the faults near o2 d1 o2 d4 and o2 d7 and the faults near bdo2 4 all agree with local higher conductivity the top right conductive zone coincides with a cluster of faults widely fractures developed in this region also provides evidence for our assumption that the o2 aquifer accepts recharge through water channel from deep ordovician limestone li et al 2009 however the detailed spatial distribution is not entirely the same as that from the geological fault distributions there are few faults in the bottom left across lower conductive zones as corroborated from the analysis of qiao et al 2013 about the same research site main folds indicated as c1 to c10 divide the region into several zones and they fit nicely with t distribution fig 16a a weak water abundant zone south of c1 is consistent with the bottom left low t zones this discovers the low permeable natures of faults or the faults maybe filled with fine materials between c4 and c7 it is another weak water abundant zone which corresponds nicely to rather low t values the western part of c7 and c8 segments is a strong water abundant region and it locates around a high t zone near discharging boreholes o2 dx6 and o2 dx9 as already confirmed by the s tomogram fig 16b it only presents a general pattern this pattern follows the characters of geological features but lacks of details the bottom left region is weak water abundant zone and faults filled with fine materials on the top right the high s values intercept the western part of folds c7 and c8 which corresponds to a strong water abundant zone in conclusion our estimated parameters especially the t distributions are confirmed by the major geological structures from faults and folds the estimated t fit nicely with fault distribution and has a roughly positive correlation with water abundant zones the estimated s has obviously two different parts without much details it match structure distributions in general 8 conclusions in this research we took advantage of the self draining characteristics of confined aquifers to design three tomographic water releasing tests in the deep ordovician o2 aquifer hydraulic tomography algorithm simsle was employed to obtain high resolution hydraulic parameter distributions the estimated results were verified by multiple datasets following major findings are obtained an artificial injection borehole was introduced to simulate the vertical recharge from deep ordovician limestone aquifers it was necessary to alleviate the abnormal high t and s values in domain the recharge rate was determined to be 90 of the water releasing rate from o2 dx6 and o2 dx9 this study confirms again that ht survey could characterize the heterogeneity at kilometer scales by using limited water releasing tests in confined aquifers in dongtan coal mine two hydrogeological compartmants are identified and the o2 aquifer has poor north south connectivity and large differences in water richness the top right part of the o2 aquifer has high t and s which is the potential water hazard site while the bottom left part is distributed low t regions verified by multiple datasets the distributions of t and s were deemed as more reliable and accurate the drilling fluid losses data and fault distributions which reflected the degree of fracture development were consistent with high t in top right area tds data and water rich zones divided by folds further proved reliability of estimated parameters these verifications provide us with further confidence in applying ht technology to hundreds of square kilometers confined aquifer investigation in conclusion based on the estimated parameter distributions the early monitoring and warning of water inrush incidents should be strengthened for the deep ordovician o2 aquifer particular attention should be paid to the areas with high t and s in which it probably could form water conducting cracks and channels under the disturbance of coal mining and will significantly increases water inrush risks credit authorship contribution statement min ma conceptualization formal analysis writing original draft zaibin liu

3506,water inrush is a typical geological disaster in the process of underground mining it is crucial to depict potential water inrush areas for mining safety in this study mining activity in dongtan coal mine is under the water inrush threat from deep ordovician limestone confined aquifers tomographic water releasing tests and simultaneous successive linear estimator simsle were conducted to characterize aquifer heterogeneity by stimulating hundreds of square kilometers an artificial injection well was firstly introduced to alleviate the influence from identified recharge channels the estimated parameter distributions indicated that the study area was divided into two separately hydrogeological compartments transmissivity t and storativity s in the north were relatively higher due to water conducting structures and more attention should be paid to this region which may develop into water inrush incidents the southern area is occupied with lower t and s which indicated relatively worse flow conditions auxiliary drawdown recovery data borehole chemistry variations drilling fluid losses and existing geological features further confirmed the estimated parameter distributions in the end we concluded that hydraulic tomography technique ht could obtain aquifer parameter information in large scales and provide supports to formulate reasonably effective water prevention and control schemes before mining deep coal seams keywords parameter estimation heterogeneity water inrush hydraulic tomography dongtan coal mine 1 introduction coal is an important type of energy to power generation and industrial production in china even today with the rapid development of green energy coal consumption still accounts for more than 50 of the total energy consumption china energy big data report 2021 nowadays coal mining has expanded to deep coal bearing strata which directly increases the risk of mining activity especially water inrush incidents one of the most threatening disasters in coal mining have caused tremendous property losses and casualties liu and cao 2011 zhou et al 2020 in order to prevent this disaster it is therefore crucial to find an effective method to predict possible water inrush locations the prediction of water inrush locations in underground mines should take into account the permeability of adjacent strata and hydraulic pressure of confined aquifer wang and park 2003 accurate characterization of aquifer parameters i e transmissivity t and storativity s has been a technological challenge for decades hydraulic tomography ht proposed by gottlieb and dietrich 1995 serves as an effective approach to alleviate this problem during ht many discharge or recharge head data are collected by progressively releasing or injecting water from discharging boreholes and measuring head responses from observation boreholes these data are inversely modelled to characterize aquifer heterogeneity in high resolution kitanidis 1995 yeh et al 1995 yeh et al 1996 over the past two decades many research groups have contributed to the advancement of interpretation methods for example sequential successive linear estimator proposed by yeh and liu 2000 pilot point method by lavenue and de marsily 2001 travel time based approaches from vasco et al 2000 and brauchler et al 2003 and bayesian geostatistical inverse protocol from fienen et al 2008 those who are interested in these methods are encouraged to refer to several review papers about inverse problems in subsurface hydrology for details such as carrera et al 2005 mclaughlin and townley 1996 and zhou et al 2014 the robust performance of ht aided by successive linear estimator sle in revealing aquifer heterogeneity has been demonstrated through small scale laboratory and field experiments e g berg and illman 2011 2012 brauchler et al 2007 illman et al 2015 luo et al 2017 zhao and illman 2017 zhao et al 2016 despite encouraging results these based on data collected synthetically or highly controlled conditions were often questioned for the real world field tests many large scale field experiments e g kuhlman et al 2008 illman et al 2009 berg and illman 2015 wang et al 2017 zha et al 2019 were therefore carried out to confirm the effectiveness of the ht technique in the absence of controlled conditions due to the ability to capture detailed characterization of aquifer heterogeneity ht has been employed to the accurate prediction of groundwater flow contaminant transport and geological structure survey illman 2014 illman et al 2010 2012 zha et al 2017 in parallel hydrogeological issues of future prediction like underground coal mine exploitations also rely on the accurate characterization of aquifer heterogeneity especially mao et al 2018 exploited inrush incident in coalfield as an active stimulus in ht for mapping geologic structures over a large area by taking advantages of commonly performed water releasing tests provided by underground confining conditions xu et al 2002 li et al 2010 liu et al 2020 interpreted sequential water releasing tests aided by ht techniques to obtain high resolution k and ss distributions and accurately identified the water hazard locations wang et al 2021 combined puming tests and wide field electromagnetic method to explore the preferential flowpaths of water inrush in coal mine areas the ability of ht technique for predicting water hazards over dozens of kilometers was investigated in this study three tomographic water releasing tests were designed to obtain the hydraulic parameters in the deep ordovician limestone aquifer at the dongtan coal mine simultaneous successive linear estimator simsle method was adopted to interpret transient water releasing tests data for obtaining a heterogeneity characterization drawdown recovery data drilling fluid losses groundwater chemistry data and geologic features were then employed to verify the estimated parameter distributions in the end we confirmed the effectiveness of using ht technique to depict aquifer heterogeneity during tomographic water releasing tests 2 description of study area 2 1 sketch map of dongtan coal mine north china coalfield is one of china s most important energy bases the dongtan underground coal mine is part of the north china coal field located in the southwest of shandong province the coal mine stretches 12 5 km north to south and 4 8 km east to west spanning 59 96 km2 fig 1 on the east and northeast sides it is bordered by impermeable yishan fault and the ziyang fault the southwest the south and the northwest are adjacent to baodian minefield nantun minefield and xinglongzhuang minefield respectively the ground elevation is between 42 46 m and 54 58 m with gentle folds and some fracture structures distributed and the mine receives groundwater recharge from the north and west directions 2 2 hydrogeological background the strata of dongtan coal mine are quaternary q jurassic j permian p carboniferous c and ordovician o from top to bottom fig 2 illustrates the geological sequences the coal bearing strata are the shanxi and taiyuan formations with a combined average thickness of 300 m currently the deep coal mining of no 16 and no 17 coal seams namely lower coal group has emerged due to the exhaustion of shallow coal resources represented by the no 3 coal seam namely upper coal group of shanxi formation there are several aquifers and aquitards related to the mining of lower coal group the carboniferous taiyuan and benxi formations consist of 18 layers of limestone with a total thickness of approximate 300 m denoted as l1 l2 and l18 wu and jin 1995 and there are several interbedding aquitards consisting of mudstone within these limestone aquifers some of these limestone aquifers such as the l10 of the taiyuan formation and the l13 and l14 of the benxi formation may affect lower coal group mining the deep ordovician system may threat mining safety as well the top two formations majiagou formation o2 and yeli formation o1 with about 450 750 m in thickness the upper surface of the o2 aquifer has gone long term weathering and fissures were well developed chen et al 2013 but there is little information regarding the o1 aquifer because the current geological boreholes are not drilled to its depth li et al 2009 based on the strata system if the aquitards surrounding the coal seams remain intact hydraulic connections between aquifers and coal mine may be limited however if the water conducting structures impair the integrity of the aquitards the probability of water inrush occurrences would rise dramatically especially in regions where water conducting fissures and faults have developed wang and park 2003 apart from the aforementioned geological strata information the hydraulic heads in these confining layers are strongly related to water inrush incidences the magnitudes of hydraulic head in aquifers l10 l13 l14 and o2 are all higher than the elevation of lower coal group at approximately 745 m li et al 2009 which are shown in the last column of fig 2 especially the o2 aquifer exerts a high hydraulic pressure up to 10 mpa on the floor of lower coal seams furthermore the l10 layer is located directly above the no 16 coal seam and just has few local water rich areas with an average thickness of 5 m this can be seen from the higher values of water yields around borehole l13 dx1 o2 dx6 and o2 dx9 in table s1 of electronic supplementary materials esm however these local water yields in the l10 can be drained out since they belong to static water storage besides the two limestone aquifers l13 and l14 have even less water yields therefore l10 l13 and l14 pose little threats to the lower group coal mining on the whole the o2 aquifer has larger thickness and extreme higher confining pressure zhang 2005 qiao et al 2019 and hence it represents the main water inrush threat to mining activity and the target aquifer of this study 3 methodology we set up three tomographic water releasing tests on the target aquifer to characterize its hydraulic parameter distributions geostatistical based simsle algorithm was employed to interpret the head responses xiang et al 2009 mao et al 2013b in simsle the distributions of hydraulic parameters could be estimated by simultaneously interpreting the head responses generated from stimulating the aquifer at multiple locations avoiding the influence of the order of releasing tests on parameter estimation the joint inversion considered the information from all tests and synthesized them into a unifiedly best unbiased parameter estimations here we provide a brief description of simsle method detailed algorithm of simsle is available in xiang et al 2009 firstly the natural logarithm of transmissivity t and storativity s ln t and ln s are treated as stationary stochastic processes based on the information of geological statistics the unconditional mean value unconditional variance value correlation scales and spatial variation function of the hydraulic parameters of the aquifer are given a prior secondly cokriging method with head measurements and hydraulic parameters at known positions is used to estimate the overall initial distributions of hydraulic parameters yeh and liu 2000 the interpolated initial hydraulic parameter fields are brought into the governing equation to yield simulated head distributions and then the predicted hydraulic parameters are iteratively corrected using the difference between the simulated and observed heads to fully exploit the non linear connection between heads and hydraulic parameters until the head difference is less than allowable criteria the model reaches convergence and the hydraulic parameters are the final estimated results moreover the diagonal elements of the residual covariance which are updated at each iteration reflect the uncertainty of estimated parameters 4 field tests 4 1 distribution of boreholes a total of 32 boreholes were deployed for water releasing tests in the o2 aquifer and they were evenly distributed throughout the study area fig 3 there were 25 boreholes drilled into o2 aquifer for about 100 m three boreholes drilled into l10 i e l10 dx3 l10 d1 and l10 d2 one borehole drilled into l13 i e l13 dx1 and three boreholes drilled into l14 i e l14 d1 l14 dx2 and l14 dx3 all boreholes were equipped with automatic water level monitoring system during the drilling process the water yields of all underground boreholes starting with dx and the drilling fluid losses of all surface boreholes starting with d were recorded among that the boreholes o2 dx6 o2 dx9 o2 dx4 o2 dx5 and o2 dx7 with high water yields served as the discharging boreholes during water releasing tests those seven boreholes distributed in l10 l13 and l14 were used to inspect the hydraulic connections between o2 aquifer and these three aquifers 4 2 tomographic water releasing tests as discussed in section 2 2 the o2 aquifer was under artesian condition and therefore three water releasing tests were setup namely stage 1 stage 2 and stage 3 the arrangement of every stage is shown in the table 1 during each stage discharging boreholes released water and recorded flow rates and hydraulic head data were simultaneously observed in all observation boreholes in stage 1 o2 dx6 and o2 dx9 quickly reached a stable total flow rate of about 325 m3 h and then these two discharging boreholes were turned off for 136 h in stage 2 boreholes o2 dx4 o2 dx5 o2 dx7 o2 dx6 and o2 dx9 all started to release water at a total flow rate of 436 5 m3 h after 155 h these five discharging boreholes were turned off for 203 h in stage 3 boreholes o2 dx4 o2 dx5 and o2 dx7 started to release water at about 101 5 m3 h after 121 h these three discharging boreholes were closed for 72 h this releasing arrangement is different from previous sequential water relealsing tests used by liu et al 2020 in the ningtiaota underground coal mine they set up a four stage superimposed water releasing tests by increasing the number of discharging boreholes step by step in other words the discharging boreholes of earlier stage were kept open when later stages started and all discharging boreholes closed at the end of tests drawdowns of later stages superimposed on previous stages the current arrangement was that the later stage was carried out after head recovery from previous stage the head data derived from the current arrangement were more like a classical hydraulic tomography test yeh and liu 2000 4 3 drawdown analysis during field tests noise inevitably corrupted head data due to the influence of the surrounding environment in this paper savitzky golay filter was used to reduce the noise order 1 frame 51 aristodemo et al 2018 this method had proven to be effective for removing high frequency noise while retaining the information of low frequency signals liu et al 2020 fig 4 illustrates the effect of noise reduction for two observation boreholes the red lines represent head fluctuations after removing noise and as expected they retain the trend of head variations during both discharge and recovery periods we then used all the denoised data to plot the drawdown contour maps at the end of each releasing period fig 5 from these figures we could see each water releasing test affected borehole responses locally when boreholes o2 dx6 and o2 dx9 were discharging during stage 1 only the areas around these two boreholes were affected as shown in fig 5a and the drawdown values were the smallest among these three stages when o2 dx4 o2 dx5 and o2 dx7 discharged during stage 3 a larger head perturbation was created in the lower part of fig 5c in the end all these five boreholes were open at the same time during stage 2 the cone of depression propagated to most parts of the domain except the top right corner fig 5b in summary the hydraulic heads gave relatively large responses in the lower part of the domain whereas the top right corner was not sensitive to the water releasing tests as for the seven boreholes located in the adjacent aquifers during stages 1 and 2 l13 dx1 had head responses as quickly as the observation boreholes in the o2 aquifer fig s1 in esm this hinted l13 might have connections with o2 in the vicinity of l13 dx1 the maximum drawdown of l13 dx1 was 26 7 m at the end of stage 1 and 29 5 m at the end of stage 2 which was much larger than observed drawdowns in o2 itself these large drawdown magnitudes further indicated a linkage between these two aquifers additionally l13 dx1 was only 60 m away from the o2 dx6 and therefore the larger magnitude was partially due to the close distance to the water discharging boreholes on the other hand the six boreholes located in l10 and l14 l10 dx3 l10 d1 l10 d2 l14 d1 l14 dx2 and l14 dx3 did not show any drawdown fluctuations corresponding to the water releasing tests even though l13 was in between l10 and l14 spatially l14 may therefore have linkages with o2 as well there was no further drilling data to support this and therefore this linkage was not considered in this study 4 4 analysis of o2 leakage as discussed in the above section there might exist connections between o2 and other aquifers during stage 1 the stable releasing rate from o2 dx6 and o2 dx9 reached 325 m3 h however there were no evident drawdowns for the surrounding observation boreholes such as o2 dx8 and o2 dx10 which were only about 1 km and 3 km away from these two discharging boreholes for one thing it means t and s may be large in regions close to water discharging boreholes but the field information in table s1 refutes this conjecture with low water yield values of 0 42 m3 h 0 16 m3 h 0 50 m3 h in o2 dx2 o2 dx8 and o2 dx10 respectively on the other hand it also means there are additional water sources coming from other aquifers to sustain low drawdown responses in o2 aquifer the existing information in table s1 shows that the water volume in l10 l13 and l14 are not abundant so there must be other water sources based on the hydrogeological information in section 2 2 it most likely comes from deeper parts e g o1 aquifer the amount of recharge from deep aquifer should be estimated based on numerical simulations 5 inverse modeling 5 1 numerical model configuration based on the analysis of geological and hydrogeological conditions a numerical model was established to identify the hydraulic parameters of o2 aquifer the 100 m thick o2 aquifer was conceptualized into a two dimensional structure fig 6 the right and bottom sides were set as no flux boundaries the left and top sides were constant head boundaries at 1000 m the model domain was divided into 40 60 cells and the dimensions of each cell was 300 m 300 m the initial hydraulic head was equal to 1000 m exponential covariance models were assumed to describe the variability of parameters the means of ln t and ln s were calculated with least square method by using head observations during each stage the initial variances of ln t and ln s were 1 0 and 0 5 the correlation scales in and y directions were set as 2000 m we used software vsaft2 to run both forward and inverse modelings yeh et al 1993 http tian hwr arizona edu downloads subsequently we ran simulations for all individual water releasing tests and joint analysis based on this highly parameterized heterogeneous model there were 10 data points along each drawdown curve picked for parameter estimations three to four data points from both early and late times and three additional data points for the intermediate period mao et al 2013a b sun et al 2013 we also discussed the impacts of selection of data on the inversion results by increasing data points of each drawdown curve to 20 and 30 5 2 simulation of vertical recharge as analyzed by the drawdown behaviors in section 4 4 there must be vertical recharge from deeper ordovician aquifer here we chose stage 2 of water releasing tests to estimate vertical recharge we first ran an inversion model without any recharge fig 7 a and 7b shows the estimate results an obvious feature is the occurrence of a large area with abnormal high t and s zones in the top right corner this is a direct reflection of low drawdowns in the region and these highly permeable and water rich areas can quickly provide enough water to maintain a lower drawdown this is different from the wrong assignment of boundary type discussed by daranond et al 2020 liu et al 2020 the estimated t and s values are as high as 1200 m2 h and 0 0005 which are two orders larger than the rest of the domain we believe this is caused by ignoring vertical recharge unfortunately the precise position of the recharge and its magnitude were unclear to simplify this problem we assumed it was a point recharge based on the small drawdowns in the top right area this point must locate in the same area we selected three candidate points in the top right area to represent possible recharge locations and they were symbolized by cross signs in fig 7a besides the trial and error approach was used to determine the magnitude of recharge by assuming a proportional rate to the total water releasing discharge the magnitude was set as 50 70 and 90 of the total discharge of northern discharging boreholes o2 dx6 and o2 dx9 6 results 6 1 determination of vertical recharge here we use the example of adding an injection borehole between o2 dx6 and o2 dx9 injection 1 in stage 2 as an illustration the estimated parameters are shown in fig 8 with a recharge rate of 50 of the total discharge the area with extreme large t and s shrinks fig 8a and d the maximum value of t changes from 1200 m2 h to 480 m2 h and s varies from 0 0005 to 0 0003 the increase of vertical recharge means the decrease of discharge from o2 aquifer which leads to the decrease of the magnitude of estimated t and s however the abnormal parameters still occupy the top right area and the parameter distributions in other places does not vary much with the added vertical recharge most areas are under initial parameters values and the bottom left part is dominant by observation boreholes in this region with the increase of vertical recharge to 70 of the discharging rate the abnormal areas continue to shrink fig 8b and e once the recharge amount reaches 90 of the total discharging rate the estimated t and s values show reasonable distributions compared to the rest of the domain there are still high t and s areas in the top right parts but they are locally distributed compared to the estimated parameters without any vertical recharge fig 7 the pattern of parameter distributions does not change with the addition of vertical recharge the domain shows two distinct hydrogeological compartments the bottom left part is mainly controlled by the three water discharging boreholes o2 dx4 o2 dx5 and o2 dx7 and surrounding observation boreholes the top right part receives influence from the two water discharging boreholes o2 dx6 and o2 dx9 we acknowledge the estimated amount and location of the vertical recharge are merely a rough approximation to the true field however it does not change the pattern of hydraulic parameter distributions we therefore will use this estimated value a recharge amount 90 of water releasing rate for the following inverse modeling for the other two potential locations the estimated parameter distributions fig s2 and s3 in esm also show two hydrogeological compartments and the top right abnormal areas continue to shrink with the increase of vertical recharge this trend is consistent with the results from the first location but due to closer distance to contant head boundary the 90 recharge value does not render estimated t and s values reasonable distributions in the top right and an increase of recharge is needed 6 2 estimated results from individual test the estimated results for each individual test are illustrated in fig 9 the matching between simulated and observed heads of each stage is shown in fig 10 and the coefficients of determination r2 for all three tests are close to 1 0 from the parameter distributions we find that t and s are relatively small in the bottom left with locally high t areas on the top right part it shows a high t area the s estimates in three stages indicate less details than t estimates this may be attributed to the fact that high cross correlation between head and storativity is limited to a narrow region between discharging and observation boreholes wu et al 2005 for both t and s the results from stage 2 and stage 3 are rather similar except the top right part this is due to both tests used the same water discharging boreholes in the bottom left part i e o2 dx4 o2 dx5 and o2 dx7 for the top right part there is not enough drawdown information to characterize this region during stage 3 and therefore estimated parameters are close to initial values and present a smooth distribution during stage 1 the main stimulus is from discharging boreholes o2 dx6 and o2 dx9 due to the addition of vertical recharges an effective smaller releasing rate induced lower drawdown responses which only propagates to short distances away from discharging boreholes therefore only the parameter information close to these boreholes is discovered 6 3 jointly estimated results the estimated results from joint inversion of three tests are provided in fig 11 the fitting results of the simulated and the observed heads of three stages are shown in fig 12 the corresponding residual variances distributions of estimated parameters are shown in fig s4 we note that obtained t and s tomograms reveal similar pattern to the inversion results of stage 2 both parameters show two relatively independent hydrogeological compartments i e a top right part and a bottom left part this similarity is caused by using all five discharging boreholes during stage 2 which has more influence on the joint inversion results there are also differences by incorporating more datasets compared with fig 9b and e by using data only from stage 2 the high t area in the top right areas moves towards right the high t zone on the left becomes more evident there is no much variation between estimated specific storage values in general t and s tomograms show positive correlation according to the residual variances shown in fig s4 the residual variances are low in areas with boreholes as well as between boreholes which suggests that the parameter estimations in these areas are more accurate than in areas where data are scarce close to boundaries 7 discussion 7 1 impact of data points selection would the results be different if we change the amount of observation data points as pointed out by luo et al 2020 there were no noticeable improvements for the prediction of independent pumping test data by including more observation points with longer simulation durations for domain size here we investigated the influence by adding more observation data in stage 2 and the results are displayed in fig s5 we find that increasing the number of observational data points along each drawdown curve does not produce substantial differences in the inverted t and s and the derived patterns are similar as a result high precision parameter distributions could be obtained even with a small amount of hydraulic data which already captures the general trend of drawdowns 7 2 comparison between predicted and observed drawdowns the estimated parameter fields were examined through comparing predicted heads with observed heads during recovery periods fig 13 the recovery periods are 136 h 203 h 72 h drawdown data were evenly chosen from the recovery curves every 10 h we can see that most data pairs are scattered along the 45 degree line especially larger drawdowns in the early recovery period due to negative values in observation drawdowns the predictions of smaller drawdowns in the later period lack accuracy the occurrence of negative values of drawdown may be attributed to water consumption from o2 aquifer in coal mine production which is not considered in the current modeling 7 3 verification by drilling fluid losses the drilling fluid losses calculated by water supply and return in drilling process could reflect the strength of rock permeability liu et al 2014 used drilling fluid loss as a quick method to evaluate transmissivity of clay layers the locations of surface boreholes and the amount of drilling fluid losses are marked in fig 14 the values of fluid losses in o2 d1 o2 d2 o2 d3 o2 d4 o2 d5 were 1 11 m3 h 0 7 m3 h 0 84 m3 h 1 5 m3 h 0 18 m3 h and the drilling fluid was all lost in o2 d7 in the bottom left region we find that the amount of drilling fluid losses at the position o2 d4 o2 d7 are larger than the surrounding boreholes which means there may be more fissures and water conductive channels this is consistent with the presence of local high t regions in fig 14a since there is no clear connection between water conducting structures and the aquifer water yields the amount of drilling fluid losses does not match the s distribution in fig 14b 7 4 verification with groundwater chemistry data water samples from underground boreholes and four surface boreholes in o2 aquifer were collected by qiao et al 2013 the magnitudes of total dissolved solids tds values are displayed in fig 15 the tds range is 1295 7 mg l 3554 5 mg l with significant differences we know that groundwater with higher tds reflects the poor local runoff conditions xing et al 2015 zhao and lu 2020 due to the slow flow rate of groundwater leaching is more sufficient and soluble salts are easy to accumulate in groundwater the top right areas with lower tds have better runoff conditions and abundant recharge from surrounding area or deep recharge channles this is reflected in the distributions of hydraulic parameters with high t and s the region around bottom left discharging boreholes with higher tds has relatively poor runoff conditions corresponding to the lower t and s values overall these chemistry data are consistent with our inversion results but ht results provide more continous hydraulic parameter distributions 7 5 verification by geological structures zhao et al 2016 showed that ht can successfully map site specific geologic features at kilometer scale field we therefore overlapped major geological faults in grey lines and folds in brown lines with hydraulic parameters fig 16 a as following our analysis in mao et al 2018 we can see that those high t zones are consistent with the general patterns of fracture lineaments the faults near o2 d1 o2 d4 and o2 d7 and the faults near bdo2 4 all agree with local higher conductivity the top right conductive zone coincides with a cluster of faults widely fractures developed in this region also provides evidence for our assumption that the o2 aquifer accepts recharge through water channel from deep ordovician limestone li et al 2009 however the detailed spatial distribution is not entirely the same as that from the geological fault distributions there are few faults in the bottom left across lower conductive zones as corroborated from the analysis of qiao et al 2013 about the same research site main folds indicated as c1 to c10 divide the region into several zones and they fit nicely with t distribution fig 16a a weak water abundant zone south of c1 is consistent with the bottom left low t zones this discovers the low permeable natures of faults or the faults maybe filled with fine materials between c4 and c7 it is another weak water abundant zone which corresponds nicely to rather low t values the western part of c7 and c8 segments is a strong water abundant region and it locates around a high t zone near discharging boreholes o2 dx6 and o2 dx9 as already confirmed by the s tomogram fig 16b it only presents a general pattern this pattern follows the characters of geological features but lacks of details the bottom left region is weak water abundant zone and faults filled with fine materials on the top right the high s values intercept the western part of folds c7 and c8 which corresponds to a strong water abundant zone in conclusion our estimated parameters especially the t distributions are confirmed by the major geological structures from faults and folds the estimated t fit nicely with fault distribution and has a roughly positive correlation with water abundant zones the estimated s has obviously two different parts without much details it match structure distributions in general 8 conclusions in this research we took advantage of the self draining characteristics of confined aquifers to design three tomographic water releasing tests in the deep ordovician o2 aquifer hydraulic tomography algorithm simsle was employed to obtain high resolution hydraulic parameter distributions the estimated results were verified by multiple datasets following major findings are obtained an artificial injection borehole was introduced to simulate the vertical recharge from deep ordovician limestone aquifers it was necessary to alleviate the abnormal high t and s values in domain the recharge rate was determined to be 90 of the water releasing rate from o2 dx6 and o2 dx9 this study confirms again that ht survey could characterize the heterogeneity at kilometer scales by using limited water releasing tests in confined aquifers in dongtan coal mine two hydrogeological compartmants are identified and the o2 aquifer has poor north south connectivity and large differences in water richness the top right part of the o2 aquifer has high t and s which is the potential water hazard site while the bottom left part is distributed low t regions verified by multiple datasets the distributions of t and s were deemed as more reliable and accurate the drilling fluid losses data and fault distributions which reflected the degree of fracture development were consistent with high t in top right area tds data and water rich zones divided by folds further proved reliability of estimated parameters these verifications provide us with further confidence in applying ht technology to hundreds of square kilometers confined aquifer investigation in conclusion based on the estimated parameter distributions the early monitoring and warning of water inrush incidents should be strengthened for the deep ordovician o2 aquifer particular attention should be paid to the areas with high t and s in which it probably could form water conducting cracks and channels under the disturbance of coal mining and will significantly increases water inrush risks credit authorship contribution statement min ma conceptualization formal analysis writing original draft zaibin liu

3507,it is shown that the imbalance between the valley slope and the regime channel slope is the primary cause of river meandering when the sediment load is less than the load transporting capacity and if bank erodibility permits when a river reach is confronted by a steep valley slope it tries to maintain uniformity in energy expenditure by expending the excess energy through channel curvature novel equations are analytically developed for the channel radius of curvature sinuosity wave length arc length initial arc angle the meander path and a modified sine generated curve based on width depth flow sediment load and roughness these equations are more general than geometrical correlations between meander variables and width that were previously proposed in the literature the developed channel sinuosity and wave length equations compare well with the available field data meandering in both alluvial and tidal channels as well as in sediment less environments supraglacial channels could be explained by the theory keywords meandering radius of curvature sinuosity channel wave length arc length angle sine generated curve 1 introduction lazarus and constantine 2013 stated that winding curving channels are a universal landscape pattern from the amazonian flood plains to the aeolis planum a ridged region of mars they added that wriggling grooves are cut into the bedrock of utah and the volcanic valleys of the lunar surface thus wherever there are rivers and natural open channels there are river bends curved reaches and meandering sections even in a straight river either the channel thalweg or the flow path usually wanders back and forth from one bank to another chang 1988 the rise of river meanders on earth has been linked to riverbank stabilization driven by the palaeozoic evolution of plant life about 440 million years ago ielpi and lapôtre 2020 gibling and davies 2012 also concluded that the banks of rivers and streams were stabilized by the development of plant roots over 250 million years where the appearance of vascular plants with root systems was associated with developments of meandering rivers this calls for a great need to understand why and how do rivers meander and how they change their plan form such understanding helps in managing rivers more effectively this study focuses on a theoretical analysis of river meandering it is aimed to highlight herein how the valley and regime channel slope imbalance affects meander bend geometry this is the condition through which the excess energy theory explains meander inception and initiation novel equations are analytically developed for the channel radius of curvature see fig 1 sinuosity wave length arc length initial arc angle the meander path and a modified sine generated curve based on the width depth flow discharge sediment load and roughness these equations are more general than the geometrical correlations between meander variables and width that were previously proposed in the literature the developed theory could explain why meanders occur even in non alluvial channels such as the meltwater channels of surface glaciers and the gulf stream the theory could explain two river processes namely channel straightening and fluvial tidal meandering an index used to describe channel planform is the sinuosity ω defined as the ratio of channel length to valley length i e ω cl vl where cl is the channel length and vl is the valley length as seen in fig 2 red river catfishing 2014 three major channel patterns classified by leopold and wolman 1957 are straight or sinuous meandering and braided a straight river has sinuosity less than 1 5 while a meandering river has sinuosity greater than 1 5 the scope is limited here to sinuous and meandering river reaches while braided conditions are beyond the scope of this research past work on river curvature meandering included 1 description of river meander plan form through empirical equations regression based equations field data based equations models 2 theories or doctrines for describing and explaining river meanders and 3 meander migration models the most important findings which are related to this study are summarized as follows the empirical equations relate the meander variables to the bankfull width of the channel such as those relations by leopold and wolman 1960 for the fully developed meanders an example is that for the relation between the channel center line of curvature rc and the channel width b as 1 r c 2 4 b the empirical equations such as eq 1 mainly describe relations between the meander variables and channel width but they do not explain the causes of meandering i e why and how rivers meander most of the empirical equations use channel width to correlate to river meander curvature variables this is due to difficulty to access data other than the width such as channel depth or flow discharge or roughness or sediment load especially using remote sensing analyses however factors other than the channel width such as the channel depth slope roughness and sediment load should be considered in any river meandering studies the well known and widely used manning s roughness equation for estimating the flow discharge q can be written assuming a wide rectangular channel as q 1 n d 5 3 s 1 2 b according to the manning s roughness equation the discharge correlates not only with the width b but also to the depth d the slope s and the manning s roughness coefficient n if a single variable has to represent the size of the river channel it would be the discharge and in its absence not only the width but also all of the above variables b d s and n have to replace the discharge lagasse et al 2002 stated that the major factors affecting alluvial stream channel forms are stream discharge magnitude and duration temperature and viscosity of the water sediment mixture sediment load including types and caliber of sediments longitudinal valley slope bank and bed resistance to erosion vegetation geology including bedrock outcrops clay plugs and changes of valley slope and finally human activities just like the regime or empirical equations statistical or field data based models such as those by howard and hemberger 1991 and finotello et al 2020 though very useful in pointing the degree of correlation between the meander variables have their limitations as they do not provide the cause effect explanation of the meander dynamics in addition the relationships between morphometric variables are usually explored for variables which can be readily and easily measured such as meander geometry variables and channel width while some equally important variables such as channel depth roughness flow discharge and sediment load typically remain unconsidered due to difficulties in their measurement the theories or doctrines for describing and explaining river meanders included mostly least work the most probable path minimum variance secondary currents dynamic stability bank erosion the coriolis force perturbation theory and silt clay content the reader is advised to look into chang 1988 and da silva and ebrahimi 2017 for more details on these theories only the points related to this study are discussed below leopold and langbein 1966 suggested that meanders are no accident and that they appear to be in the form in which a river does the least work in turning yalin 1971 proposed that meanders could be attributed to the law governing the spatial correlations among perturbations in turbulent flows he considered that macro turbulent eddies presumably secondary flow cells would produce a sequence of periodical reverses along the direction of the flow he suggested that the wavelength λ could be related to the channel width b by 2 λ 2 π b or λ b 2 π 6 following the same line as yalin 1971 da silva 2006 considered the initiation of meandering being due to the action of horizontal turbulence bursts on the deformable banks da silva 2006 noticed that the average horizontal burst length was 6b which is analogous to the meandering wave length being also 6b langbein and leopold 1966 presented the theory of minimum variance in which meander planform corresponds to that of a random walk whose most frequent form minimizes the sum of the squares of the changes in direction in each successive unit length the direction angles are then sine functions of channel distance the sine generated curve this yields a meander shape typically present in meandering rivers and has the characteristic that the ratio of meander length to average radius of curvature in the bend is 4 7 chang 1988 stated that because the controlling variables of water and sediment inflows are not included in deriving the sine generated curve equation it does not explain the cause of meandering he further added that since the shape parameter maximum angle a path makes with mean down path direction needs to be prescribed in the equation the sine generated curve does not predict the channel slope or the sinuosity of the meander path among bank erosion models is that by ikeda et al 1981 who used a stability analysis of a sinuous channel with erodible banks many researchers followed the inspiring work of ikeda et al 1981 to study the dynamics of meandering rivers such as seminara et al 2001 seminara 2006 camporeale et al 2007 frascati and lanzoni 2009 and pittaluga and seminara 2011 in the meander path model by chang 1984 which is based on growth and decay of the secondary currents the shape parameter sinuosity has to be prescribed as an independent variable so the sinuosity or channel slope is not determined by secondary currents in the two major doctrines the most probable path and secondary currents one shape parameter has to be assumed a priori while the second one is determined according to the corresponding doctrine various other models have been developed to simulate the dynamics of meandering rivers e g howard and knutson 1984 abad and garcía 2006 schwenk et al 2015 bogoni et al 2017 and monegaglia and tubino 2019 the work of hasegawa 1977 and ikeda et al 1981 who first introduced a dynamic approach for bank erosion and a linearized flow field model in sinuous channels provided a relatively simple framework for computational modelling a suite of models has emerged following their pioneering work that share the following morphodynamic model for bank erosion ζ eoub ikeda et al 1981 in which the lateral migration rate ζ at a point along a channel centerline is the product of a bank erodibility coefficient eo and an excess bank velocity ub resulting from perturbations in channel curvature and bar formation frascati and lanzoni 2009 schwenk et al 2015 and bogoni et al 2017 used excess bank velocity as the criterion for bank erosion in their meander migration models the criterion that excess velocity or excess shear stress leads to bank migration is a necessary condition for meander evolution and yet is not sufficient to explain meander formation of course when critical values of either bank velocities or bank shear stress are exceeded bank erosion would occur but there are two possibilities and lateral meander migration is just one of them the other possibility is the occurrence of channel width widening and associated bed rising without necessarily going toward lateral meander migration the eroded bank material could be deposited either at the same cross section or at sections further downstream therefore this approach does not determine the initiation of meandering but it determines how much meandering is occurring after its initiation via bank erosion processes numerical models in general and specifically meander dynamics or migration models are useful when there are sufficient data for performing model calibration as the erosion rate coefficient and the critical shear stress are site specific and are not known a priori in the calibration process the soil parameters such as the erosion rate coefficient or the soil critical shear stress parameters are adjusted so that a known historic river centerline run through the model matches a known recent river centerline these models are useful to study the long time evolution of river meandering dynamics in the order of hundreds to thousands of years schwenk et al 2015 made a long term model simulation of river meandering of 30 000 years in their study of the life of a meander bend while camporeale et al 2007 simulated meander evolution for 3000 years however calibration data might not be always available abad and garcía 2006 in their river meander model rvr stated several limitations of their model such as using a constant water discharge no bed aggradation or degradation no sediment effects a constant channel width and a constant application of the specified model parameters e g the river migration coefficient with time even though natural or man made perturbation could alter the results in this case such models have their limitations and a simpler approach such as the one offered by the excess energy theory herein is needed for prediction of at least the final equilibrium river meander geometry the above review demonstrates that either there have been empirical relations that are insufficient for the explanation of the causes and mechanics of river meandering or merely qualitative explanations that fall short in helping the practical engineer or numerical models that demand detailed data for their calibration and assume automatic initiation of meandering now useful observations by past researchers that furnish the floor for the excess energy theory is presented as follows leopold and wolman 1960 p 787 postulated that meandering is a principal means of dissipating stream energy schumm 1968 stated that the ancestral river and the murrumbidgee river developed a very sinuous course as a result of dissipating the energy no longer required for the transport of bedload he further added that for a river to dissipate its excess energy by decreasing its gradient by incision over the entire length of its channel would have involved much work and large quantities of sediment would have to be removed from the system during a short period of time a reduction of gradient by degradation would have been only partly effective for with incision the stream would have reached the coarser sediments transported during a previous regime and these would have acted as armor against further degradation while the development of a sinuous course appears to have been the only alternative by reworking of the alluvium a river could develop a meandering course of low gradient without having to transport large quantities of sediment from the system schumm 1968 among what could be considered as a useful qualitative explanation of river meandering is that by chang 1988 among the options by which the natural river channel tries to maintain a nearly smooth water surface profile when confronted by a downstream steep slope is either depositing its sediment load or meandering in the first case of deposition the bed slope is reduced and the stream power is consequently reduced in the case of meandering the induced curvature increases the energy loss consequently reducing the stream power and meanders provide the adjustment in channel pattern so that a river of flatter channel slope may exist on a steeper valley slope chang 1988 he added also that any thesis on the origin of meandering must explain why the channel slope must be flatter than the alluvially formed valley slope and that this slope relationship is the necessary and sufficient condition for the occurrence of meanders chang 1988 such statements will be useful in the theory developed herein da silva 2006 also considered that the decrement of the slope from sv valley slope to sr regime slope sr is the slope where equilibrium exists between the inflow of sediment and water discharges and the channel sediment transporting capacity can only be achieved either by degradation aggradation or by meandering she stated that the regime slope of large sand bed rivers is usually rather small and reduction of channel slope through incision would require tremendous degradation for these reasons the river channel usually adjusts by developing a flatter slope through meandering da silva 2006 chang 1988 and da silva 2006 observed that meandering river reaches have valley slopes that are higher or steeper than the curved flatter meandering channel although the foregoing paragraphs stated that the difference between the valley and regime channel slopes is the key to river meandering and curvature yet no quantification has been made of the above observations for occurrence of meandering in order to reduce the energy slope due to the steeper valley slope in other words no previous work provided a quantitative relation of the difference between the steeper valley slope and the channel regime slope on one hand to the degree of channel curvature meandering on the other hand although the connection between the two was recognized however such statement contributed to the basic framework for the excess energy theory which provides the required quantification in a novel manner the suggested theoretical approach herein provides explanation of why the regime channel slope must be flatter than the alluvially formed valley slope during the formation of curved meandering reaches an excess energy theory is developed showing how the imbalance between the valley slope and regime channel slope is the primary cause for river curvature and meandering when the sediment load is less than the load capacity and bank erodibility permits it gives more general expressions for example for the channel radius of curvature as a function of not only the channel width but also of the channel roughness channel depth froude number and difference between the valley and regime channel slopes this is an improvement to the simple relations r b 2 4 and λ 6b as the newly developed equations provide more general framework by inclusion of more influencing variables other than the width the presented novel relations of the meander geometry variables are in terms of all the influential factors such as channel roughness width depth velocity water discharge and sediment discharge in addition a meander path model is developed and useful modifications of the classic sine generated curve are presented also the developed equations from the excess energy theory can be useful to meander migration modelling in addition explaining fluvial tidal meandering channel straightening and non alluvial meandering is made possible by the developed theory 2 development of the excess energy theory for river meandering the excess energy theory states when the sediment load is less than the channel sediment transporting capacity the river channel when confronted by a steep valley slope sv is the valley slope tries to maintain equilibrium or uniformity in energy expenditure by expending the excess energy this is done through curvature meandering development limited by bank resistance for which the induced curvature increases the energy loss and thus decreases the energy slope in other words the steeper valley slope relative to the regime channel slope sv sr where sr is the regime channel slope causes the river channel to meander or deform laterally or horizontally in order to increase the energy loss this leads to reduction of the energy slope and consequently the stream power if there is not enough sediment load to cause deposition and if the bank resistance allows for meander development therefore meander formation is a case of horizontal channel adjustment if there was enough sediment supply the river channel would try to restore its slope to the pre steepening conditions through sediment deposition vertical channel adjustment or deformation bank resistance on the other hand may limit the full development of meandering and in this case thalweg meandering might be an option for the river to spend the excess energy while large scale degradation would be another option thus meander formation depends on horizontal river channel adjustment while aggradation and degradation are cases of vertical river channel adjustments different combinations of all the above mechanisms with various degrees are also possible depending on the relative magnitudes of the influencing variables but scope is limited here only to meandering it should be noted that it is not the absolute value of the valley slope that determines meandering conditions but it is the difference between the valley and regime channel slopes sv sr which is the controlling factor if a valley slope is steep but the inflow quantities of water and sediment require high regime slope then the difference of slopes excess energy is negligible causing straight at low sediment load or braiding at high sediment load channel conditions to occur this may justify why there are no widespread meandering rivers in mountain landscapes where slopes are typically larger conversely if the inflow quantities of water and sediment require small regime slope then the difference of slopes excess energy could be significant and meandering conditions occur in order to expend this excess energy it should be emphasized that chang 1988 assumed uniformity in the water surface profile while in the developed theory herein uniformity of the excess energy is assumed which is more general in addition chang 1988 was pointing to the situation where the upstream channel is confronted by a downstream steep valley slope this special case can also be considered by the excess energy theory in this case the regime channel slope sr is taken equal to the upstream channel slope when using the excess energy theory equations developed hereinafter at very high floods during geologic time scales the alluvial valley is formed and the channel slope is nearly equal to the valley slope indicating straight planform it can be assumed in that case the energy loss slope friction slope is equal to the bed slope and hence no excess energy is available for meandering at such condition the river channel planform is nearly straight and the channel slope can be considered as the regime slope sr under the imposed flow and sediment discharges due to the high value of such floods the valley or channel slope is relatively high in order to transport the very large amounts of water and sediment discharges when this period of high floods is followed by periods of relatively low floods the river channel requires a regime slope that is less than the existing steep valley slope thus there is an excess energy for the river channel to spend in this case pittaluga and seminara 2011 in their investigation of effects of nonlinearity and unsteadiness on river meandering found a channel that is subjected to a repeated sequence of floods reaches a dynamic equilibrium if there is an increase in energy head excess energy there are two possible ways for the river channel to respond and restore the equilibrium conditions by absorbing the increase in energy one way is reducing the bed slope through sediment deposition or significant channel incision aggradation or degradation forming vertical channel adjustments and the second way is through increasing the energy loss via channel curvature and meandering development horizontal channel adjustment as was stated before according to schumm 1968 chang 1988 and da silva 2006 that in order to reduce the excess energy reduction of channel slope through incision would require tremendous degradation aggradation requires large amounts of sediment that could not be available and the river channel usually adjusts by developing a flatter slope through meandering this occurs when the sediment load is less than the transporting capacity so aggradation is not possible therefore quantification of the meandering process is dealt with in this study initially it is assumed that the valley and channel slopes were uniform and being equal to each other along the length of a river reach then for some reasons geologic or climatic or hydrologic or man made the regime slope of the channel sr required to transport the imposed water and sediment inflows is less than the steeper valley slope sv this causes the river channel to perform maximum stretching or lengthening through curving and meandering in order to spend the excess energy subjected to the constraints of sediment load and bank erodibility according to the excess energy theory the river channel will tend to curve or meander i e deviating from the straight path and taking a curved path when the sediment load is less than capacity and bank erodibility permits in this case based on physical reasoning and observations by past researchers leopold and wolman 1960 schumm 1968 chang 1988 and da silva 2006 the excess energy which is sv sr will be converted to transverse energy loss due to curvature this physically based statement is expressed in terms of the energy slopes as 3 s s v s r δ s where s is the transverse energy slope due to loss in energy induced by curvature and δ s is the difference in slopes between the steep valley slope sv and the relatively flat regime channel slope sr it should be noted that s is the slope of loss in energy mainly due to the internal fluid friction resulted from the transverse secondary current circulation and the transverse boundary shear eq 3 where all the terms have units of slope indicates that the excess energy due to an increase in the bed slope the valley slope is greater than the regime channel slope required to transport the inflows of water and sediment is dissipated through the tendency of the river channel to meander and consequently expending some energy loss upon doing the curving it should be noted that meandering occurs when there is a change of river regime which induces imbalance between the valley and regime channel slopes for every regime slope there is a certain meandering geometry and therefore meandering can occur even under uniform longitudinal river conditions when the regime channel slope is equal to the valley slope straight conditions will occur with the disappearance of meandering channel straightening conditions through increasing the wave length or formation of cutoffs eq 3 can be derived from the momentum conservation law as follows first consider the well known one dimensional steady saint venant equation the saint venant equation expresses conservation of the linear momentum in one dimension and is given by 4 u g d u d x d y d x s o s f δ s d d x u 2 2 g y where u is the cross sectional average longitudinal velocity g is the gravitational acceleration x is the longitudinal distance along the channel y is the water depth so is the bed slope sf is the energy loss slope friction slope and δ s is excess energy slope it is assumed that before the initiation of meandering the river channel reach is initially straight and under equilibrium or regime conditions the available water and sediment inflows to the reach are transported under the channel regime slope the channel energy loss slope must be equal to this regime slope i e sf sr this means that the energy lost is just the energy spent on transporting the water and sediment inflows by overcoming the channel resistance in addition it is clear that the channel bed slope in this case is equal to the valley bed slope i e so sv this means that the driving force for transporting the inflows of water and sediment is the channel slope gravitational flow which under straight planform conditions is equal to the valley slope when there is any imbalance of the water and sediment inflows the channel regime slope will change and formation of meandering or curved reach will be resulted in to accommodate this change the channel regime slope by definition is the slope at which water and sediment are transported along the channel for stable meanders under equilibrium conditions it follows that the energy loss slope is equal to the channel regime slope i e sf sr to illustrate that so sv consider a lab experiment in which an alluvial meandering channel exists on a longitudinally tilted flume under uniform or equilibrium conditions in this case the bed slope of the channel is the slope of the titled flume which controls velocity and depth gravitational effect slope of the tilted flume is similar to the valley slope and hence it can be stated that so sv therefore in the case of channel curvature and meandering it is still true that sf sr and so sv the quantity so sf in eq 4 and throughout herein will be made equal to sv sr i e so sf sv sr always the quantity so sf or its equivalent sv sr is defined here as the excess energy δ s if so sf sv sr 0 then the quantity u 2 2 g y specific energy should have a constant value along the river reach this establishes that when the regime slope is equal to the valley slope uniform specific energy condition along the river length is attained the river channel adjusts its velocity and depth accordingly to maintain this uniformity this confirms the validity of assuming uniform conditions it should be noted that the quantity sf which is considered here as the regime slope sr is the energy loss friction slope due to the bed skin roughness or friction it is usually termed as s and it is considered as the energy loss slope required to transporting the imposed water and sediment discharges along the river channel based on the above it can be considered that for straight channel river reaches 5 δ s s v s r s v s 0 this means that sv sr s at the straight channel condition now if there is a decrease in the inflow of water or sediment or channel roughness then the quantity s sr will accordingly decrease as less energy is required due to less water or sediment inflow or less channel roughness there will be imbalance between the valley slope and the channel regime slope and an excess energy exists δ s 0 as explained before this imbalance is absorbed through energy loss due to transverse circulation which occurs when the channel reach becomes curved or meandering i e tendency toward making the excess energy zero δ s 0 there will be transverse energy loss due to the transverse circulation with its slope called s in that case eq 4 becomes 6 δ s s v s s 0 o r s v s r s 0 eq 6 is equivalent to eq 3 and this equivalency and the derivation of eq 6 from the well known and the very established saint venant equation supports the validity of eq 3 at least conceptually it can also be stated that the excess energy theory is physically based as it was derived from the physical law of momentum conservation by saint venant equation it is well known that curvature meander formation induces secondary currents or circulation which causes the transverse energy loss rozovskii s 1957 or chang s 1988 approach can be used to express the transverse energy expenditure in curved reaches s via 7 s φ r d r 2 f 2 where φ r is a function representing the channel bed roughness r d is the channel axis water depth r is the radius of curvature of the channel axis and f is the flow froude number for uniform meander plan shape r should be the radius of curvature of the channel center line and for non uniform meander plan shape r should be the radius of curvature at the apex of the meandering pattern chang 1988 analytically developed an expression for the roughness function φ r in terms of the darcy weisbach friction factor i e r f and was given as 8 φ f 2 07 f 4 68 f 1 83 f 3 2 0 565 f rozovskii s 1957 friction function may be used in place of eq 8 in terms of the chezy coefficient r c as by 9 φ c 12 g c 30 g c 2 the chezy coefficient c is related to the friction factor f by c 8 g f substituting s from eq 7 while using r f into eq 3 and solving for r yields 10 r d f φ f δ s d f φ f s v s r in eq 10 and the equations to follow the friction factor is used as the roughness factor because it is dimensionless while the chezy s and manning s roughness coefficients have dimensions it should be noted also that eq 10 can be applied at any given local point along the meander path or applied to the whole meander loop in an average sense in the first case the variables in eq 10 are local values at any given point along the meander path where due to the non uniformity of these variables an irregular meander pattern would occur i e different r values result due to different friction water depth and velocity along the meander path therefore the dependency of the roughness coefficient flow depth and longitudinal velocity on the stream wise coordinate s seems to be the best option for inclusion of stream wise variability of r in the second case if the variables are selected as averages along the whole meander loop the radius of curvature will be the average radius of curvature and this implies treating the meander as a regular meander with circular shape the reason for the explicit absence of the stream wise curvilinear coordinate s in eq 10 is that the original equation eq 7 for the transverse energy loss does not contain the stream wise coordinate s because the analysis is made for a regular meander pattern it is beyond the scope of this work to find such relation for non regular meander pattern and this is left for future research therefore the dependency of the roughness coefficient flow depth and longitudinal velocity on the stream wise curvilinear coordinate s seems to be the best option for inclusion of stream wise variability eq 10 in dimensionless form becomes 11 r d f φ f δ s o r r d f φ f s v s r another dimensionless form of eq 11 in terms of r b the radius width ratio is 12 r b 1 b d f φ f s v s r eq 12 should be compared to eq 1 where the generality of eq 11 is more evident as r b depends now on the width depth ratio froude number channel roughness and slope imbalance the curvature of the curved meandering channel is 1 r can be obtained from eq 10 via 13 1 r 1 d 1 f δ s φ f o r 1 r 1 d 1 f s v s r φ f substituting f u g d in eq 13 yields 14 1 r g d 1 u δ s φ f o r 1 r g d 1 u s v s r φ f it is assumed in eq 14 that the channel is very wide hydraulic radius is similar to water depth for channels that are not wide the water depth is substituted by the hydraulic radius the regime or equilibrium channel slope sr can be calculated in different ways one way is directly through the regime equations such as by lacey 1958 via 15 s r 1 6 d 1 2 5 3 1830 q 1 6 where d is the median bed material size in millimeters and q is the flow discharge cfs chang 1988 used the bed load transport formula of duboys 1879 to evaluate the equilibrium channel slope sr via 16 q s q s b 0 173 d 4 3 γ r s r γ r s r τ c b where qs is the bed load sediment discharge qs is the unit bed load discharge d is the median bed size in millimeters γ is the water unit weight r is the channel hydraulic radius equals the water depth for very wide channels and τc is the critical shear stress for incipient motion the solution of this quadratic equation for sr is 17a s r τ c τ c 2 4 d 4 3 q s 0 173 2 γ r the plus sign should be used in eq 17a above as sr is by definition a positive quantity eq 17a shows the bed material properties through d and τ c the shields parameter through τ c the sediment load through qs and the flow depth through r affect the regime slope and consequently affect meander development assuming wide channel conditions allows replacing the hydraulic radius r in eq 17a by the average flow depth d solving for the flow depth from the manning s roughness equation n is the manning s roughness coefficient and substituting this in eq 17a results in 17b s r τ c τ c 2 4 d 4 3 q s 0 173 b 2 γ n 2 q 2 b 2 s 3 10 the right hand side in eq 17b includes many influencing variables on river meandering in this case effects of sediment load qs water discharge q channel width b the flow energy slope s which can be approximated by the water surface slope manning s roughness coefficient n critical shear stress τ c sediment size d and water unit weight γ on meander development are clear the changes of the inflows of water and sediment due to maybe geologic hydrologic climate change or man made activities such as deforestation urbanization and damming will thus affect directly sr and consequently affect river plan form as inferred from eq 10 17a and 17b for a given sediment load or water discharge and all the other variables in eqs 17a and 17b are also known the equilibrium slope sr is calculated and if it is less than the valley slope then curvature or meandering would occur subjected to bank resistance constraints thus the excess energy theory provides a basis for determining the initiation of meandering if sr from eqs 17a and 17b is greater than the valley slope no curvature meandering would occur and cutoff conditions might happen or braiding conditions if sr is equal to the valley slope then the river channel reach would be straight in this way the slope difference sv sr determines the inception or initiation of meandering which is similar to the incipient motion criteria for bed sediment particles movement τ τc thus the excess energy theory provides criterion for meander inception the advantage of the present approach is that the inflows of water and sediment discharges are included in the determination of the regime slope in this way the effects of climate change and man made activities which influence the water and sediment discharges on the river channel plan form can be investigated of course other sediment transport formulas than the one by duboys 1879 can be used as well all parameters or factors that will affect the regime channel slope will in turn affect the meander parameters as suggested by the proposed approach therefore the link is established between the controlling variables of water and sediment discharges channel roughness the river channel longitudinal regime slope valley slope and meander plan form a meander path model can be obtained by recognizing the mathematical definition of the curvature which can be given according to swokowski et al 1994 by 18 1 r d θ ds where θ is the angle that the meander path at a given point makes with the mean down path direction and s is a length coordinate along the meander path s is a curvilinear coordinate substituting 1 r from eq 14 into eq 18 rearranging and integrating yield 19a θ o θ d θ 0 s g d 1 u s v s r φ f d s or 19b θ o θ d θ 0 s 1 f s v s r φ f d s where in eq 19a θo is the initial angle the meander path makes with the mean down path direction when the variations of the depth velocity friction factor and sr are known along the meander path a general meander path model is obtained and the degree of irregularity of meandering would depend on the irregularity of the variation of these variables in eq 19b the length coordinate s is made dimensionless using s s d with the result of the appearance of the froude number f the dimensionless eq 19b is applicable to one meander loop as pointed out before the variables f u and d in eq 19a often vary along the meander path the stream wise variability would result in an irregular meander pattern if these variables are uniform a regular meander pattern would occur the sign in eqs 19a or 19b would produce θ values greater than θo along the distance from s m 4 to s 3 m 4 where m is the total arc length along the meander path and the sign would produce θ values less than θo from distance zero to s m 4 and from distance s 3 m 4 to s m after developing the equation for predicting channel radius of curvature and a meander path model attention is now given to finding channel sinuosity sinuosity is defined here as the ratio of valley slope to channel slope chang 1988 i e ω sv sr where ω is the channel sinuosity this can be seen by noting that ω can be written as equal to cl vl δh vl δh cl where δh is the energy drop along the meander path this gives sinuosity as the ratio of valley slope δh vl to channel slope δh cl expressing sinuosity in terms of slopes rather than lengths has the advantage as will be seen hereinafter that through the channel slope sr the influencing variables of velocity width depth roughness flow and sediment discharges are included one can consider that the length defined sinuosity is a geometrical definition while the slope defined sinuosity is a dynamic definition eq 13 can be rewritten as 20 1 r 1 d 1 f s v s r φ f 1 r 1 d 1 f s r s v s r 1 φ f eq 20 in terms of the sinuosity ω can be written as 21 1 r 1 d 1 f s r ω 1 φ f eq 21 is solved for ω resulting in 22 ω 1 d r 2 f 2 1 s r φ f substituting f2 sr 8 f in eq 22 where all quantities refer to channel conditions results in 23 ω 1 d r 2 8 f φ f eq 23 gives the river channel sinuosity in terms of the channel depth radius ratio and the friction factor because eq 23 was derived from eq 13 the two equations are not independent to eliminate the usually unknown radius of curvature r appearing in eq 23 the following equation by chang 1988 can be used 24 r b 2 2 0 15 b d 4 eq 24 was developed theoretically based on chang s energy approach with the channel radius width ranges from 2 2 to 4 while the channel width depth ranges from 4 to 16 eq 24 is multiplied by b d to give 25 r d 2 2 b d 0 15 b d b d 4 the right hand side of eq 25 can be written as 26 r d ψ b d 2 2 b d 0 15 b d b d 4 where ψ b d is a function of b d given as by eq 26 substituting for r d from eq 26 into eq 23 yields 27 ω 1 1 ψ b d 2 8 f φ f eq 27 gives the river channel sinuosity in terms of the channel width depth ratio and the friction factor these two quantities are usually easily known from field data it should be noted that eqs 22 and 23 give the more general equation for sinuosity in which effects of the most significant controlling variables on sinuosity are included such as the regime slope sr velocity u and depth d and hence the discharge u and d are given by the froude number f eq 27 is a simplified form for practical purposes due to data availability the meander arc length m was found by chang 1984 from his mathematical meander path model to be a function of the depth and channel roughness independent of channel curvature or arc angle the dimensionless m d was inversely related to channel roughness as given in table 1 and shown also in fig 3 data in table 1 can be fitted to give the following equation for m d as 28 m d 50 73 f 0 45 the r2 value from the regression analysis of the data in table 1 is 0 9989 since sinuosity m λ then the following equation can be written for the dimensionless wave length as 29a λ d 50 73 f 0 45 1 d r 2 8 f φ f 50 73 f 0 45 1 1 ψ b d 2 8 f φ f eq 29a expresses the dimensionless meander wave length λ d as a function of the channel roughness friction factor and the width depth ratio both sides in eq 29a are divided by b d to obtain 29b λ b 50 73 f 0 45 b d 1 d r 2 8 f φ f 50 73 f 0 45 b d 1 1 ψ b d 2 8 f φ f indeed eq 29b offers a more general representation of the dimensionless channel wave length than that by eq 2 because the effects of channel width depth ratio and roughness could be seen if a circular path is assumed to the curved meandering channel its maximum wave length will occur when the meandering channel is exactly two opposite half circles in one cycle this indicates that the maximum wave length λmax 4 r which compares with λ 4 7 r by leopold and wolman 1957 if r 2 4b is used then λmax 9 6 b which is close to the estimates of λ 10 b by leopold and wolman 1957 it is well known that the leopold and wolman 1957 relationship was derived by correlating data from many meanders and therefore it represents an average indicator thus the results using the assumption of circular arcs or regular meander pattern is not far from previous findings from field data substituting eq 10 for r in λmax 4 r yields 30 λ m a x 4 d f φ f s v s r eq 30 offers a more general expression than by eq 2 for the wavelength by taking several factors in influencing the meander wavelength the sine generated curve by langbein and leopold 1966 is given as 31 θ θ o sin 2 π s m eq 28 can be used to substitute for m in eq 31 and after rearranging one obtains 32 θ θ o sin 2 π f 0 45 50 73 d s eq 32 is an improvement of the sine generated curve as now effects of channel depth and friction factor are included the needed data such as channel friction factor and depth on the right hand side of eq 32 are usually easy to find instead of the hard to calculate arc length m which is required in the equation by langbein and leopold 1966 if a circular or regular meander is assumed then at a distance s m 4 the angle θ would be zero eq 19 at this condition becomes 33 θ o 0 d θ 0 m 4 g d 1 u s v s r φ f d s assuming the integrand on the right hand side of eq 33 to be constant with respect to s carrying out the integration and solving for the initial arc angle θ o yield 34 θ o g d 1 u s v s r φ f m 4 50 73 g d 4 u s v s r φ f f 0 45 eq 34 can be substituted in the modified sine generated curve given in eq 32 to the best of the author s knowledge there has not been any equation to predict the initial arc angle only eq 34 offers this the original or current form of the sine generated curve has disadvantages that the initial arc angle and the meander length θ o and m which are required as an input data for use in the sine curve are not known a priori these disadvantages are now overcome by the excess energy theory which provides predictions to those two variables resulting in all the influencing hydraulic and roughness variables to appear explicitly in the modified sine curve the sine generated curve is thus transformed from a geometrically based curve to a physically based curve 3 theoretical results related to the excess energy theory eq 10 indicates that channels characterized by high froude numbers have higher radius of curvature more straight and lower sinuous channels having more friction have higher radius of curvature more straight and lower sinuous and channels having larger difference between the valley and regime channel slopes have smaller radius of curvature and are more sinuous such information is evident from field observations as shown in knighton 1984 and chang 1988 these findings could not be inferred from the simple relation in eq 1 eq 12 establishes a more general form for the channel radius width ratio than is given by eq 1 if eq 12 is applied while assuming that the valley slope is 3 times the channel slope as can be seen in the data by schumm 1968 the friction factor is assumed 0 4 resulting in a friction function φ f with a value approximately as 3 0 the channel gradient is assumed 0 0001 the width depth ratio is assumed 10 and the froude number is assumed in the typical range between 0 2 and 0 3 this yields r b from 2 to 3 this finding is in agreement with the field observations by leopold et al 1964 williams 1986 chang 1988 and the sine generated curve the following observations can be made from eqs 10 13 and 14 if sr is equal to sv then channel curvature 1 r would be zero or alternatively r indicating perfectly straight river reach if sr is slightly less than sv then r will be very large and sinuosity would be small the more the difference or imbalance between sv and sr the more channel curvature and meandering in agreement with field observations this establishes that the imbalance between the valley slope and channel regime slope is the cause of channel curvature and meandering maximum curvature or fully developed meandering occurs when the quantity sv sr is at maximum this may occur according to eq 17b when the bed sediment load qs is zero i e near clear water conditions this indicates that when there is no sediment inflow small energy slope is needed just to carry water this situation resembles conditions downstream of dams that trap sediments where it is observed the river channel becomes more sinuous compared to the pre dam conditions chang 1988 parallel to the above point it is seen that channel curvature 1 r is directly proportional to the square root of the difference between the valley and regime channel slopes the steeper the valley slope with respect to the regime channel slope the more curved is the river channel the case of the chippewa river schumm and beathard 1976 supports that finding where the upper meandering reach between durand to eau claire had a flatter channel slope of 0 000278 and a steeper valley slope of 0 000333 with a sinuosity of 1 45 channel curvature is inversely proportional to the square root of friction as φ f is monotonically increasing function as seen in fig 4 channels with smooth beds or less friction tend to curve more than channels with rougher beds with more friction this is because more friction increases the longitudinal energy loss s leaving less excess energy to be dissipated through curvature and meandering for example sand bed channels under flat bed conditions become more curved or meandering than gravel bed channels for the same bed material type the coarsening of the bed material particles reduces channel curvature channel curvature 1 r is inversely proportional to velocity u as seen in eq 14 high velocity or discharge conditions assuming no bank over flow conditions may eliminate or reduce meandering or curvature of the channel which explains the occurrence of channel straightening of meandering river reaches this may occur for example due to increase of flows resulting from deforestation or climate change with increased flooding or high flow release downstream of dams under high velocity or high flows the river channel seeks to increase its energy slope in order to be able to transport the increased inflows of water and sediment in contrary to this river reaches downstream of dams will tend to be more sinuous in case of water discharge and sediment load reduction as also stated by chang 1988 increase of water discharges with associated increase in velocity would also lead to straightening of the thalweg navigation channel meandering which occur inside straight river reaches with rigid or non erosive banks for wide rectangular channels with constant discharge and constant channel width velocity is inversely proportional to water depth i e u α 1 d or 1 u α d substituting this in eq 14 results in 1 r d i e deeper channels become more meandering but with a slow rate due to the square root variation than shallow channels under constant discharge and width conditions for wide rectangular channels with constant discharge and constant water depth velocity is inversely proportional to channel width i e u α 1 b or 1 u α b where b is the channel width substituting this in eq 14 results in 1 r b i e wide channels become more meandering than narrow channels but this occurs under constant discharge constant water depth conditions and free migrating meander conditions this may delineate the observation by da silva and ebrahimi 2017 that alluvial meandering streams are usually rather wide channels the excess energy theory may explain the process of channel straightening as follows if the inflows of water and sediment discharges are high enough to cause high channel regime slope sr in order to transport the water and sediment then sr could approach the valley slope sv 1 r s v s r in this case according to eq 14 1 r approaches zero indicating a nearly straight channel path whether channel straightening of a meander reach occurs through change of fluvial style significant increase in the wave length toward a straight channel path or through cutoff process either neck cutoff or chute cutoff as long as bank erosion permits that depends on the relative magnitudes of all the variables and is left for further research constantine et al 2014 based on landsat imagery spanning 1985 2013 concluded that imposed sediment loads influence planform changes in lowland rivers across the amazon they found that rivers with higher sediment loads experience higher annual migration rates and more frequent occurrence of meander cutoffs ielpi et al 2021 investigated cutoff kinematics along the humboldt river nevada a stream that from 1994 to 2019 hosted an exceptionally high number of cutoffs they found that a coincidence between major floods and cutoff incidence is first suggestive of hydrographic modulation the developed theory answers the question which was raised by da silva 2006 about why meanders occur even when there is no sediment transport such as at meltwater channels of surface glaciers and the gulf stream as what is required for meandering is existence of excess energy even if the sediment load is zero for alluvial channels with no sediment transport eq 10 and eqs 17a and 17b include the possibility of having zero bed load and yet occurrence of meandering is possible due to existence of excess energy sv sr where sr τc γ r for non alluvial channels such as meltwater channels of surface glaciers and the gulf stream the equilibrium or regime slope sr is the energy slope which can be given according to non alluvial channels resistance formulas such as manning s or chezy s equations in this case the channel adjusts its longitudinal regime slope sr to accommodate or transport the given quantity of water discharge simply any stream even if it has a small flow which flows under gravity requires energy slope calculated for example from a roughness formula such as manning s formula to flow which is the regime slope if the slope of the plane on which this stream flows similar to the valley slope in fluvial streams is greater than the regime slope there would be excess energy to spend and this energy expenditure is done through curving and meandering of the stream in order to illustrate the use of eq 14 a hypothetical river reach is assumed with d 5 m u 1 m s and sr 6 10 5 the resulting darcy weisbach friction factor becomes f 0 0235 and φ f 1 057 table 2 shows the prediction by eq 14 of the radius of curvature of the hypothetical meandering channel resulting from slope imbalance between the valley and regime slopes δs interestingly table 2 shows for very small slope difference δs 0 001 10 5 the radius of curvature is 7340 m a nearly straight plan form while when the slope difference is relatively large as 10 10 5 the radius of curvature is 73 m very sharp bend a ratio of 100 times fold is there between the radii of curvatures in these two cases this indicates that the excess energy theory can predict not only highly curvature and meandering conditions but also channel straightening conditions needles to stress the importance of the constraints of sediment availability and bank resistance which in real life might have considerable effects in real life the slope imbalance increase could be for example due to valley steepening or improper design of a canal slope where the bed slope is steeper than the equilibrium regime bed slope or increase of the navigational channel slope after dredging or occurrence of a meander cutoff in a high flood year followed by low flood in the next year eqs 23 and 27 for the sinuosity indicate the following inverse variation of sinuosity against width depth ratio is clear from eq 27 as also noted in schumm s 1968 data from the great plains rivers murrumbidgee river australia and prior stream victoria australia according to eq 27 if the width depth ratio approaches infinity theoretically speaking or has a very large value field conditions sinuosity would approach unity indicating a straight plan form river channel sinuosity increases non linearly with increasing channel depth decreases non linearly with increasing channel width and with increasing channel radius of curvature in accordance with the findings of knighton 1984 chang 1988 stated that rivers with a small width depth ratio or channel roughness or both can be more sinuous which can also be inferred from eq 23 noting that φ f f versus f is a decreasing function as seen in fig 5 da silva and ebrahimi 2017 addressed the importance when investigating either experimentally or numerically the mechanics of alluvial meandering stream to a priori reflect on the plan shape and width to depth ratio it should be noted that eq 23 can be written as 35 ω 1 s s where s is the longitudinal energy loss slope due to skin friction which in addition can also include bed form resistance it can be assumed that s is equal to sr eq 35 can be a quick way for determining the transverse energy loss slope given the channel sinuosity from aerial maps or satellite images and the longitudinal channel slope eq 35 indicates that sinuosity can have different values depending on the ratio of s s for straight river reaches where no curvature occurs s 0 and therefore sinuosity would be exactly equal to 1 0 according to eq 35 chang 1983 states that the transverse velocity component in meandering channels is generally lower than the longitudinal or primary velocity but such is not the case for the energy expenditure he added that the loss due to transverse circulation may be of the same order of magnitude as the longitudinal loss at a higher depth to radius ratio or lower channel roughness or both camporeale et al 2007 reviewed the importance of the physical mechanisms involved in river meandering by comparing some existing linear models and extensions thereof the analysis of the models shows the importance of the closure of secondary currents especially in the modeling of eddy viscosity the close connection between the secondary currents and the transverse energy loss cause effect relation supports the role that the transverse energy loss plays in river meandering as a surrogate variable to the secondary currents if s is equal to s as could be inferred according to chang 1983 sinuosity will then become equal to 2 0 this is the case of equality of the longitudinal and transverse energy losses grime 2015 reported that the average sinuosity of 258 rivers was found to be 1 94 which is close to 2 0 if it is argued that grime s finding was based on crowed sourced data which could come from rivers that maybe impacted by man made activities the large number of data points 258 is nonetheless very large enough for accepting this postulate 4 theory application using field and mathematical modeling data chang 1988 stated that it is rare to find complete river data required for comparison with his analytical equations for meandering which is the case also with the equations developed herein this is due to the fact that published data about plan geometry of sinuous streams seldom contains valuable information such as channel roughness and flow parameters although these are the most basic data the author finds this true up to now as researchers focused on satellite images which show the geometrical meander variables in addition to channel width such as for example in ielpi and lapôtre 2020 they selected channel width to reflect channel size unfortunately no data were recorded for channel depth discharge slope and roughness williams 1986 presented 48 valuable data points but showing only the channel cross sectional and meander features without flow discharge and channel roughness howard and hemberger 1991 in their multivariate characterization of meanders used 40 morphometric variables that have been measured on 57 sections of freely meandering channels from 33 rivers these objective variables are computed from digitized traces of the channel centerline and include measures of sinuosity meander wave length curvature moments meander asymmetry and pattern irregularity unfortunately hydraulic variables and roughness data were not collected in addition lazarus and constantine 2013 compiled sinuosity data for 20 rivers all over the world but in terms of valley slope and flood plain manning s roughness coefficient recently finotello et al 2020 collected a remotely sensed planforms of about 10 000 fluvial and tidal meanders worldwide they considered four main variables of sinuosity intrinsic wave length curvature and asymmetry index in spite of all these detailed data no hydraulic and roughness data were collected in summary complete data even on the average scale of one meander loop are hard to find let alone any local data in which channel roughness and flow variables change along the meander path river data as an averages over meander bends seen in table 3 was compiled by ponce 1976 and schumm 1968 with measured sinuosity ω width depth ratio b d and friction factor f the data are sorted according to the width depth ratio interestingly the data shows that sinuosity is inversely proportional to the width depth ratio as also can be seen from eq 27 these data are used for comparison with the present approach prediction equation eq 27 the data by ponce were measured from three of the link canals in pakistan these canals are essentially straight sand bed channels with a meandering thalweg and they all have width depth ratio of 24 the other set of data for meandering rivers compiled by schumm include 12 rivers in the midwestern united states three murrumbidgee river sections and one ancestral river section these rivers have flat slopes non braided channel pattern and width depth ratios between 4 and 21 the friction factor ranges from 0 025 smooth bed channels to 0 4 rough bed channels it should be noted that the data by ponce 1976 is based on large sample of wave lengths from each canal to determine the predominant mode wavelength of the thalweg while schumm 1968 data are at river cross sections table 3 shows the results of applying eq 27 for calculating sinuosity supplemented by using either eqs 8 or 9 for the friction function both approaches give very close results to the field data with the predictions using eq 8 being relatively better the close predictions by both friction functions illustrate near independency of the results on the equation selected for the friction function the maximum absolute relative error was 8 in case of using eq 8 and 14 in case of using eq 9 one possible source of the errors in the use of eqs 8 or 9 is that they are developed for steady and uniform flow conditions in actual river cases conditions could be different i e unsteady and non uniform however the small magnitude of the errors suggests the validity of this approximation the agreement with field data could be considered excellent in both approaches as seen also from figs 6 and 7 where most points are close to the line of perfect agreement thus the agreement with these field data of natural rivers supports the proposed theory interestingly table 3 shows the excess energy theory is able to predict wide range of sinuosity values as predicting large sinuosity meanders ω 2 37 and 2 2 to sinuosity values close to unity ω 1 01 and 1 02 this indicates that the excess energy theory can predict not only highly curvature and meandering conditions but also channel straightening conditions using the same equation table 4 shows that there is a good agreement between the prediction by eq 29a versus the measured dimensionless channel wave length λ d the data are sorted according to the friction factor table 4 also shows that there is no noticeable difference between the predictions using either of the friction functions although eq 28 which was incorporated into eq 29a was developed using only six data values the good match between eq 29a predictions and the field data is very promising keeping in mind the complexity of the meandering phenomenon some errors are as high as 44 but many are below 17 eq 2 after multiplying λ b by b d to obtain λ d highly under predicts the wave length and its prediction errors reaches 70 the superiority of eq 29a which is based on the excess energy theory over the regime equation eq 2 is evident from table 4 table 5 shows the predicted by eq 29b versus measured dimensionless wave length λ b the dimensionless measured values of λ d were divided by b d to obtain λ b like the last case good agreement with the field data is also obtained by using eq 29b chang 1984 developed a meander path mathematical model based on the equation of motion for transverse circulation in channels the scale parameter arc length was analytically determined from the channel length required for the decay and growth of the transverse circulation therefore only the shape parameter arc angle or curvature at apex was needed to be specified for a given radius of channel curvature at the apex and other required quantities the depth velocity friction factor f the meander path was obtained by solving the general equation for the spatial variation of the transverse surface velocity along the meander path using the method of finite differences chang 1984 presented sample regular meander paths using his mathematical model which are shown in table 6 along with the present approach predictions using eq 23 in using eq 23 the data about the friction factor and r d provided by chang 1984 were used it is noted that the data included the depth radius ratio and therefore eq 23 was used directly good agreement between the two approaches is obtained except at the very sharp bend where r d was as low as 15 and flow separation might be expected 5 discussion eqs 3 and 10 hold locally at any given point along the meander path or along the whole path in an average sense when considering the first situation eq 10 can be rewritten as 36 r t s 1 g u t s d t s φ f t s s v s r t s 1 g d t s q t s b t s φ f t s s v s r t s where t is time s is the curvilinear distance along the meander path q is the water discharge and the valley slope is assumed being constant the notation t s means dependence of the variables upon space and time thus eq 36 allows for considering unsteady and non uniform conditions when eq 36 is applied at two consecutive times t1 and t2 and at a given point the change in the channel radius of curvature over time is obtained i e δ r s r t 2 s r t 1 s the quantity δ r s represents meander development over time at a given location which is similar to the bank change for lateral meander migration δ r s also represents lateral bank shift the effect of water discharge q and sediment load through sr in eq 17a b provides the link between the hydrologic variables of water and sediment discharges and the meander shape variables further research is needed for validation of this work for channels with higher width depth ratios where an equation other than eq 24 is needed eq 24 was reported by chang 1988 for maximum width depth ratio of 16 for river cases with width depth ratio of 24 used in this study eq 24 was assumed still applicable i e it was extrapolated in lack of another alternative the foregoing analysis assumed that the river banks are free to move so the river banks are not constituting a limiting value for river meandering this occurs if the river banks resistance to erosion is relatively low when the river banks have high relative resistance to erosion this will limit the formation of fully developed meanders or may force the river channel to follow an irregular path dictated by the local topography and bank resistance in this case the river channel might migrate in the downstream direction searching for weaker banks to erode while consuming the excess energy using eq 7 along with eqs 8 or 9 which were developed as transverse resistance equations under steady and uniform flow conditions should not pose significant problem in investigating meandering under unsteady and non uniform conditions this is similar to using the longitudinal flow resistance formulas such as manning s darcy weisbach s and chezy s equations in flow and sediment models when investigating unsteady and non uniform conditions although these formulas were developed under steady and uniform flow conditions this has been well accepted and is a common practice approach it is also similar to using bed load and sediment transport formulas in unsteady and non uniform water and sediment models while these formulas were developed under steady and uniform flow conditions various researchers in their dynamic meandering modeling studies have used the uniform flow formulas such as schwenk et al 2015 bogoni et al 2017 monegaglia and tubino 2019 and ielpi et al 2021 in other words the use of these equations locally and instantaneously is a valid assumption and justified due to the small errors resulting from comparing the theoretical results by the theory and actual field conditions which are assumed to be changing gradually the case of tidally influenced river mouths and or estuaries could be considered herein when there is a downstream control such as the existence of a sea level also a lake or a reservoir the slope of river reach further upstream of the sea often will be greater than the downstream reach adjacent to the sea in the case where there is not enough sediment supply and no or little bank resistance the river channel will tend to meander in the downstream reach the tidally influenced reach to consume the excess energy coming from the upstream alluvial reach in case of existence of enough sediment formation of a delta will occur to consume the excess energy and reduce the slope between these two cases possible combination of fluvial tidal river meandering and deltaic formation is possible further explanation of fluvial tidal influenced river mouths and or estuaries is given as follows the river reach further upstream of the sea has high momentum or high energy high energy slope and where the river meets the sea it would have small momentum or small energy due to collision with the sea water a transition zone must therefore exist between the zone of high energy and the zone of small energy at the sea the river is trying to stop or slow down as if the river is trying to push the brakes before reaching the sea and it needs enough friction to do that however enough friction might not always be available if there is not enough friction the river channel would try to dissipate its excess energy through meandering thus forming a fluvial tidal meandering river reach this meandering is constrained by bank resistance and sediment availability the following hypothetical numerical example is given as an illustration suppose the fluvial tidal meandering reach has length of 40 km and energy head of 1 2 m i e assuming at 40 km upstream of the sea the river is at 1 2 m 120 cm stage above the mean sea level and assuming also that the velocity head is small so the energy head is equal to the river stage the river reach needs then 3 cm km of energy expenditure to reach to the sea 120 cm 40 km 3 cm km assuming further that longitudinal resistance grain and form roughness in this tidally influenced reach produces an energy loss slope friction slope of 2 cm km this results in excess energy of 1 cm km to spend before reaching to the sea one possible way of energy expenditure is through meandering and in this case the transverse energy slope needed for equilibrium would be 1 cm km i e the ratio of s s 0 5 sinuosity would be 1 5 according to eq 35 in this case 0 8 m of energy head is spent on longitudinal resistance while 0 4 m is spent on transverse resistance due to meandering eq 10 for fluvial meandering could be applied in the case of fluvial tidal meandering this is done by the replacement of the valley slope sv by the steep slope of the upstream channel reach and the regime channel slope sr is replaced by the flat slope of the downstream tidally influenced meandering reach it should be noted that in fluvial tidal meandering the excess energy comes from differences or imbalances in energy through the longitudinal profile along the river spatial differences while the excess energy in case of fluvial meandering as in eq 10 comes from differences in energy through time variations due to changing flow and sediment conditions from one flood episode to another or from one flow regime to another temporal differences in either case this excess energy has to be consumed by forming a meandering curved channel in the absence of abundant sediment load and the extent of curvature meandering is limited by bank erodibility da silva 2006 reported that from the debates on meandering theories eventually the idea settled that any theory should explain i why the wave length of meanders λ 6b and ii why meanders occur even when there is no sediment transport such as at meltwater channels of surface glaciers and the gulf stream firstly indeed λ 6b is an oversimplification and eq 29b and eq 30 offer a more general relation of the channel wavelength where many important factors affect the wavelength as well as the channel width in other words the relation λ 6b could be considered as a special case of either of eq 29b and eq 30 table 5 shows measured values of λ b very different from 6 reaching as high as about λ b 21 so λ b 6 should be considered with caution the data in table 5 suggests that λ b 6 could be taken as a minimum value subjected to further research confirmation secondly the developed approach herein does not require the existence of sediment transport as meander occurrence is induced by the difference between the valley slope and the regime channel slope it should be noted that the formulation allows either the existence of sediment transport or also non existance of sediment transport at all when there is sediment transport the effects of sediment inflows as an upstream boundary condition appears in the determination of the channel regime slope as shown in eqs 17a and 17b eq 17a and 17b allow also for zero sediment transport in meandering channels for non alluvial channels the regime slope is the slope from resistance formulas such as manning s equation which is required to transport the water or the fluid da silva 2006 noted that past researchers used a minimization of some energy related quantity to which the stream adjusts its channel geometry including the plan form geometry for example chang 1988 used the stream power γ q s yang et al 1981 used the unit stream power u s yalin 1992 used the flow froude number and yalin and da silva 2001 used the average velocity u however in the present approach direct energy balance is used without resorting to minimization techniques which are complicated and often require computer programming the topic of optimal transport networks needs sophisticated mathematical tools such as a variational approach see e g birnir et al 2001 and chen et al 2014 to obtain reliable results a correction factor c ω can be added to eq 35 that accounts for effects of bank resistance and compensates for the assumptions or simplifications made herein eq 35 can be written as 37 ω 1 c ω s s the correction factor c ω can be determined based on fitting actual meander sinuosity data to s s similarly when the second term on the right hand side of eqs 23 and 27 is multiplied by a suitable correction coefficient cω to account for the simplifications and assumptions made herein this will shift the analysis from idealized regular meanders to natural irregular meanders further research is recommended for selecting such coefficient based on large river data sets eq 37 can be derived from the definition of meander sinuosity which can be written as follows 38 ω c l v l v l δ c l v l 1 δ c l v l 1 m λ λ where δ c l cl vl is the excess of the curved length than the straight channel length it can be assumed that the length in each path of the channel is proportional to the corresponding energy loss slope in other words the excess curved length δ c l is proportional to the transverse energy loss due to curvature and the straight length λ is proportional to longitudinal energy slope loss thus eq 38 can be written as 39 ω 1 m λ λ 1 c 1 s c 2 s 1 c ω s s where c1 and c2 are constants of the proportionality and c1 c2 cω eq 39 is identical to eq 37 and its derivation from the basic definition of the sinuosity of meandering channels supports the equations derived from the excess energy theory and consequently supports the excess energy theory itself some theories assume that it takes small perturbation or deviation or small flow curvature to generate river meandering for example howard and knutson 1984 assumed that when there is flow curvature bank erosion will start and meandering growth will take place and develop they assumed then bank erosion to depend on r b radius width ratio however what really drives r to begin with what is the mechanism that generates flow curvature in the first place they started from straight channel and superimposed on it small random perturbations to produce meandering channel pattern also bogoni et al 2017 in their meander morphodynamic model applied perturbations in the transverse direction to straight channel with small random fluctuations assuming they are normally distributed with zero mean and standard deviation as 0 01 of half the width no physical mechanism or physical law exists behind these perturbations which are artificially induced in the form of statistical or mathematical functions in this way the real causes or the origins of river meandering are not addressed differences between causes and effects results should be carefully understood here flow curvature and bank erosion are effects or results from the mechanism that initiates the meandering process most theories on meandering emphasize some special phenomena observed in meandering channels and neglect the physical meaning which creates them yang s 1971 in general all the theories can explain how the meandering rivers continue to meander but fail to explain how meanders initiate khatsuria 2010 the excess energy theory is really addressing the above issue as it advocates that when there is a difference between the valley slope and the regime channel slope this would be the driving or initiating mechanism for river meandering and this is the triggering mechanism for starting flow curvature bank erosion and meandering in order to consume the excess energy through transverse energy loss therefore bank erosion based models do not explain the causes of river meandering however these models are very useful tools in describing the meandering process itself and its development over time after its initiation bank erosion should be understood that it is a constraint on river meandering not a cause of meandering nor it is a meandering sustaining mechanism for if the banks are extremely weak occurrence of freely complete meandering might not necessarily happen as the process is governed by different mechanisms such as the flow and sediment conditions also if the banks are extremely rigid and the flow and sediment conditions require meandering then according to bank erosion methods nothing would happen this is in spite that flow curvature might take place and meandering of the thalweg is one possibility while formation of alternate bars if sediment exists is another possibility since the excess energy theory provides meander initiation while bank erosion or river meander dynamic models provide the tools for simulating meander development with time the two could be integrated together the excess energy theory can aid such models as by providing them with an analytical relation for the channel radius of curvature in terms of the meandering generating mechanism sv sr roughness and flow variables velocity discharge width depth and sediment load it might be argued that perfectly straight flows in nature are rare because some small topographic irregularities always exist and this would suffice in creating flow instabilities the same question by the author is still valid what is are the cause s of these small topographic irregularities what caused them how did they originate whether these perturbations are due to some physical small topographic irregularities or mathematical or statistical functions in all these cases there are unexplained initial perturbations which were created in the form of micro meandering shape like a sine curve with very small amplitude the excess energy solves this paradox by showing that starting from a perfectly straight line path meander inception could be generated due to the slope imbalance sv sr the argument should be that any theory on the cause of river meandering should start with a perfect straight line and looks for ways to generate a curving or meandering path in fact the excess energy theory does this perfectly it complements previous theories by providing a cause of river meandering which is the difference of the valley and regime slopes sv sr for very small sv sr then according to eq 10 the radius of curvature will have a value and this could be the cause for these small perturbations needed in river migration models interestingly also the same result could be obtained from eq 30 for sv sr 0 λmax would be infinity perfect straight line as sv sr increases slightly above zero λmax would start to have a large value which creates a perturbed channel with very small amplitude r is also large with the increase of the slope difference λmax and r would decrease creating the typical meander shape curve note this analysis could not be made with the classic equation λ 6b finally it should be emphasized that eq 3 constitutes the excess energy theory model for curvature meandering equations like eqs 7 and 8 for the transverse energy loss or eqs 17a and 17b for the regime slope required for transporting a given water and sediment discharge or eq 24 for expressing curvature ratio r b in terms of the width depth ratio b d are just auxiliary or closure equations to eq 3 in addition eq 28 is developed as a closure equation to facilitate the prediction of the meander wave length these auxiliary equations were used to allow for workable or applicable equations that can be compared to the corresponding equations developed by previous researchers and also to obtain form of equations that permit comparison with field data to reemphasize on the limitation of these equations eqs 7 and 8 chang 1988 for the transverse energy loss are based on the assumption of wide rectangular cross section super elevation and transverse variations of the longitudinal and transverse velocities are not considered and a linear vertical distribution of the transverse velocity is assumed eq 16 as a bed load equation has the well known limitations of bed load equations as that it is developed for uniform sediment mixture and wide rectangular channels under steady and uniform flow conditions eq 24 is reported to be applicable to width depth ratios less than 16 so further testing is needed for rivers that are wider than this ratio eq 28 is based on the model results of chang 1984 meander path model which is applicable to non braided rivers with uniform width and mean depth further research in the context of applicability of these closure equations to the excess energy theory is recommended to either support the use of these equations or to find better applicable equations as the source of the excess energy theory equations is the saint venant steady one dimensional equation and also the fact that the auxiliary relations are also one dimensionally based the most significant limitations of the excess energy theory are those due to the one dimensional assumption in other words all the considered variables herein such as the depth width velocity discharge and roughness are only allowed to vary along the channel centerline therefore the developed excess energy theory cannot account for transverse variations of the influencing variables for example such as depth or roughness lateral variation the theory gives the final equilibrium meandering geometry without determining the time needed to reach final equilibrium conditions on the other hand the time needed to reach equilibrium conditions can be determined by meander dynamic models 6 conclusions this study provides a physically based theory of river curvature and meandering based on the concept of excess energy the excess energy theory is based onphysical reasoning solid mathematical foundation the saint venant equation and field observations unlike earlier theoretical papers this approach does not require an optimization i e minimization or maximization of a particular hydraulic property it is shown herein by the excess energy theory that the imbalance between the valley and the regime channel slopes is the primary cause of river curvature meandering when the sediment load is less than the load transporting capacity and bank erodibility permits the theory is based on the assumption that if the sediment supply is less than the channel sediment transporting capacity and bank erodibility permits river channels curve or meander in order to maintain uniformity in energy expenditure when confronted by steep valley slopes by expending the excess energy through formation of curved channel reach an advantage of this approach is that the inflows of the hydrologic variables of water and sediment discharges are included in the determination of the regime slope which in turn affects meander geometry and this opens the doors for investigating effects of climate change and man made events on river plan forms novel analytical expressions are developed for the channel radius of curvature sinuosity wave length arc length initial arc angle meander path and a modified sine generated curve the theory expresses the channel radius of curvature in terms of channel depth flow froude number friction function and the difference between the valley slope and the channel regime slope channel sinuosity on the other hand is expressed in terms of a function of the channel width depth ratio a friction function and a friction coefficient such as darcy weisbach friction factor both equations describe correctly direction of change in meander geometry due to changes in the influential factors the equations for prediction of channel sinuosity and wave length proved successful when tested against existing field data and mathematical model results the developed theory showed that a decrease in the channel regime slope in relation to the valley slope leads to increase in channel curvature and meandering this condition is the primary cause for river curvature and meandering signaling the initiating mechanism for curvature or meandering the developed theory answers the question which was raised by da silva 2006 about why meanders occur even when there is no sediment transport the excess energy theory explained fluvial tidal meandering and channel straightening river processes one of the main conclusions of this study that it shows it is not sufficient to study and analyze river meandering using only geometrical data collected nowadays through satellite imagery such as meander geometry radius of curvature wave length migration rates etc and channel width the reason for such insufficiency is that these geometrical variables except for the width are effects of meandering rather than causes while width alone cannot be the sole influencing or causable or surrogate variable the excess energy theory has shown that the hydraulic variables such as flow discharge depth velocity slope valley and channel and sediment variables such as sediment load type and size of sediment load are very important influencing variables that cause curvature and meander formation and development therefore complete geometry and hydraulic data collection is necessary for a thorough

3507,it is shown that the imbalance between the valley slope and the regime channel slope is the primary cause of river meandering when the sediment load is less than the load transporting capacity and if bank erodibility permits when a river reach is confronted by a steep valley slope it tries to maintain uniformity in energy expenditure by expending the excess energy through channel curvature novel equations are analytically developed for the channel radius of curvature sinuosity wave length arc length initial arc angle the meander path and a modified sine generated curve based on width depth flow sediment load and roughness these equations are more general than geometrical correlations between meander variables and width that were previously proposed in the literature the developed channel sinuosity and wave length equations compare well with the available field data meandering in both alluvial and tidal channels as well as in sediment less environments supraglacial channels could be explained by the theory keywords meandering radius of curvature sinuosity channel wave length arc length angle sine generated curve 1 introduction lazarus and constantine 2013 stated that winding curving channels are a universal landscape pattern from the amazonian flood plains to the aeolis planum a ridged region of mars they added that wriggling grooves are cut into the bedrock of utah and the volcanic valleys of the lunar surface thus wherever there are rivers and natural open channels there are river bends curved reaches and meandering sections even in a straight river either the channel thalweg or the flow path usually wanders back and forth from one bank to another chang 1988 the rise of river meanders on earth has been linked to riverbank stabilization driven by the palaeozoic evolution of plant life about 440 million years ago ielpi and lapôtre 2020 gibling and davies 2012 also concluded that the banks of rivers and streams were stabilized by the development of plant roots over 250 million years where the appearance of vascular plants with root systems was associated with developments of meandering rivers this calls for a great need to understand why and how do rivers meander and how they change their plan form such understanding helps in managing rivers more effectively this study focuses on a theoretical analysis of river meandering it is aimed to highlight herein how the valley and regime channel slope imbalance affects meander bend geometry this is the condition through which the excess energy theory explains meander inception and initiation novel equations are analytically developed for the channel radius of curvature see fig 1 sinuosity wave length arc length initial arc angle the meander path and a modified sine generated curve based on the width depth flow discharge sediment load and roughness these equations are more general than the geometrical correlations between meander variables and width that were previously proposed in the literature the developed theory could explain why meanders occur even in non alluvial channels such as the meltwater channels of surface glaciers and the gulf stream the theory could explain two river processes namely channel straightening and fluvial tidal meandering an index used to describe channel planform is the sinuosity ω defined as the ratio of channel length to valley length i e ω cl vl where cl is the channel length and vl is the valley length as seen in fig 2 red river catfishing 2014 three major channel patterns classified by leopold and wolman 1957 are straight or sinuous meandering and braided a straight river has sinuosity less than 1 5 while a meandering river has sinuosity greater than 1 5 the scope is limited here to sinuous and meandering river reaches while braided conditions are beyond the scope of this research past work on river curvature meandering included 1 description of river meander plan form through empirical equations regression based equations field data based equations models 2 theories or doctrines for describing and explaining river meanders and 3 meander migration models the most important findings which are related to this study are summarized as follows the empirical equations relate the meander variables to the bankfull width of the channel such as those relations by leopold and wolman 1960 for the fully developed meanders an example is that for the relation between the channel center line of curvature rc and the channel width b as 1 r c 2 4 b the empirical equations such as eq 1 mainly describe relations between the meander variables and channel width but they do not explain the causes of meandering i e why and how rivers meander most of the empirical equations use channel width to correlate to river meander curvature variables this is due to difficulty to access data other than the width such as channel depth or flow discharge or roughness or sediment load especially using remote sensing analyses however factors other than the channel width such as the channel depth slope roughness and sediment load should be considered in any river meandering studies the well known and widely used manning s roughness equation for estimating the flow discharge q can be written assuming a wide rectangular channel as q 1 n d 5 3 s 1 2 b according to the manning s roughness equation the discharge correlates not only with the width b but also to the depth d the slope s and the manning s roughness coefficient n if a single variable has to represent the size of the river channel it would be the discharge and in its absence not only the width but also all of the above variables b d s and n have to replace the discharge lagasse et al 2002 stated that the major factors affecting alluvial stream channel forms are stream discharge magnitude and duration temperature and viscosity of the water sediment mixture sediment load including types and caliber of sediments longitudinal valley slope bank and bed resistance to erosion vegetation geology including bedrock outcrops clay plugs and changes of valley slope and finally human activities just like the regime or empirical equations statistical or field data based models such as those by howard and hemberger 1991 and finotello et al 2020 though very useful in pointing the degree of correlation between the meander variables have their limitations as they do not provide the cause effect explanation of the meander dynamics in addition the relationships between morphometric variables are usually explored for variables which can be readily and easily measured such as meander geometry variables and channel width while some equally important variables such as channel depth roughness flow discharge and sediment load typically remain unconsidered due to difficulties in their measurement the theories or doctrines for describing and explaining river meanders included mostly least work the most probable path minimum variance secondary currents dynamic stability bank erosion the coriolis force perturbation theory and silt clay content the reader is advised to look into chang 1988 and da silva and ebrahimi 2017 for more details on these theories only the points related to this study are discussed below leopold and langbein 1966 suggested that meanders are no accident and that they appear to be in the form in which a river does the least work in turning yalin 1971 proposed that meanders could be attributed to the law governing the spatial correlations among perturbations in turbulent flows he considered that macro turbulent eddies presumably secondary flow cells would produce a sequence of periodical reverses along the direction of the flow he suggested that the wavelength λ could be related to the channel width b by 2 λ 2 π b or λ b 2 π 6 following the same line as yalin 1971 da silva 2006 considered the initiation of meandering being due to the action of horizontal turbulence bursts on the deformable banks da silva 2006 noticed that the average horizontal burst length was 6b which is analogous to the meandering wave length being also 6b langbein and leopold 1966 presented the theory of minimum variance in which meander planform corresponds to that of a random walk whose most frequent form minimizes the sum of the squares of the changes in direction in each successive unit length the direction angles are then sine functions of channel distance the sine generated curve this yields a meander shape typically present in meandering rivers and has the characteristic that the ratio of meander length to average radius of curvature in the bend is 4 7 chang 1988 stated that because the controlling variables of water and sediment inflows are not included in deriving the sine generated curve equation it does not explain the cause of meandering he further added that since the shape parameter maximum angle a path makes with mean down path direction needs to be prescribed in the equation the sine generated curve does not predict the channel slope or the sinuosity of the meander path among bank erosion models is that by ikeda et al 1981 who used a stability analysis of a sinuous channel with erodible banks many researchers followed the inspiring work of ikeda et al 1981 to study the dynamics of meandering rivers such as seminara et al 2001 seminara 2006 camporeale et al 2007 frascati and lanzoni 2009 and pittaluga and seminara 2011 in the meander path model by chang 1984 which is based on growth and decay of the secondary currents the shape parameter sinuosity has to be prescribed as an independent variable so the sinuosity or channel slope is not determined by secondary currents in the two major doctrines the most probable path and secondary currents one shape parameter has to be assumed a priori while the second one is determined according to the corresponding doctrine various other models have been developed to simulate the dynamics of meandering rivers e g howard and knutson 1984 abad and garcía 2006 schwenk et al 2015 bogoni et al 2017 and monegaglia and tubino 2019 the work of hasegawa 1977 and ikeda et al 1981 who first introduced a dynamic approach for bank erosion and a linearized flow field model in sinuous channels provided a relatively simple framework for computational modelling a suite of models has emerged following their pioneering work that share the following morphodynamic model for bank erosion ζ eoub ikeda et al 1981 in which the lateral migration rate ζ at a point along a channel centerline is the product of a bank erodibility coefficient eo and an excess bank velocity ub resulting from perturbations in channel curvature and bar formation frascati and lanzoni 2009 schwenk et al 2015 and bogoni et al 2017 used excess bank velocity as the criterion for bank erosion in their meander migration models the criterion that excess velocity or excess shear stress leads to bank migration is a necessary condition for meander evolution and yet is not sufficient to explain meander formation of course when critical values of either bank velocities or bank shear stress are exceeded bank erosion would occur but there are two possibilities and lateral meander migration is just one of them the other possibility is the occurrence of channel width widening and associated bed rising without necessarily going toward lateral meander migration the eroded bank material could be deposited either at the same cross section or at sections further downstream therefore this approach does not determine the initiation of meandering but it determines how much meandering is occurring after its initiation via bank erosion processes numerical models in general and specifically meander dynamics or migration models are useful when there are sufficient data for performing model calibration as the erosion rate coefficient and the critical shear stress are site specific and are not known a priori in the calibration process the soil parameters such as the erosion rate coefficient or the soil critical shear stress parameters are adjusted so that a known historic river centerline run through the model matches a known recent river centerline these models are useful to study the long time evolution of river meandering dynamics in the order of hundreds to thousands of years schwenk et al 2015 made a long term model simulation of river meandering of 30 000 years in their study of the life of a meander bend while camporeale et al 2007 simulated meander evolution for 3000 years however calibration data might not be always available abad and garcía 2006 in their river meander model rvr stated several limitations of their model such as using a constant water discharge no bed aggradation or degradation no sediment effects a constant channel width and a constant application of the specified model parameters e g the river migration coefficient with time even though natural or man made perturbation could alter the results in this case such models have their limitations and a simpler approach such as the one offered by the excess energy theory herein is needed for prediction of at least the final equilibrium river meander geometry the above review demonstrates that either there have been empirical relations that are insufficient for the explanation of the causes and mechanics of river meandering or merely qualitative explanations that fall short in helping the practical engineer or numerical models that demand detailed data for their calibration and assume automatic initiation of meandering now useful observations by past researchers that furnish the floor for the excess energy theory is presented as follows leopold and wolman 1960 p 787 postulated that meandering is a principal means of dissipating stream energy schumm 1968 stated that the ancestral river and the murrumbidgee river developed a very sinuous course as a result of dissipating the energy no longer required for the transport of bedload he further added that for a river to dissipate its excess energy by decreasing its gradient by incision over the entire length of its channel would have involved much work and large quantities of sediment would have to be removed from the system during a short period of time a reduction of gradient by degradation would have been only partly effective for with incision the stream would have reached the coarser sediments transported during a previous regime and these would have acted as armor against further degradation while the development of a sinuous course appears to have been the only alternative by reworking of the alluvium a river could develop a meandering course of low gradient without having to transport large quantities of sediment from the system schumm 1968 among what could be considered as a useful qualitative explanation of river meandering is that by chang 1988 among the options by which the natural river channel tries to maintain a nearly smooth water surface profile when confronted by a downstream steep slope is either depositing its sediment load or meandering in the first case of deposition the bed slope is reduced and the stream power is consequently reduced in the case of meandering the induced curvature increases the energy loss consequently reducing the stream power and meanders provide the adjustment in channel pattern so that a river of flatter channel slope may exist on a steeper valley slope chang 1988 he added also that any thesis on the origin of meandering must explain why the channel slope must be flatter than the alluvially formed valley slope and that this slope relationship is the necessary and sufficient condition for the occurrence of meanders chang 1988 such statements will be useful in the theory developed herein da silva 2006 also considered that the decrement of the slope from sv valley slope to sr regime slope sr is the slope where equilibrium exists between the inflow of sediment and water discharges and the channel sediment transporting capacity can only be achieved either by degradation aggradation or by meandering she stated that the regime slope of large sand bed rivers is usually rather small and reduction of channel slope through incision would require tremendous degradation for these reasons the river channel usually adjusts by developing a flatter slope through meandering da silva 2006 chang 1988 and da silva 2006 observed that meandering river reaches have valley slopes that are higher or steeper than the curved flatter meandering channel although the foregoing paragraphs stated that the difference between the valley and regime channel slopes is the key to river meandering and curvature yet no quantification has been made of the above observations for occurrence of meandering in order to reduce the energy slope due to the steeper valley slope in other words no previous work provided a quantitative relation of the difference between the steeper valley slope and the channel regime slope on one hand to the degree of channel curvature meandering on the other hand although the connection between the two was recognized however such statement contributed to the basic framework for the excess energy theory which provides the required quantification in a novel manner the suggested theoretical approach herein provides explanation of why the regime channel slope must be flatter than the alluvially formed valley slope during the formation of curved meandering reaches an excess energy theory is developed showing how the imbalance between the valley slope and regime channel slope is the primary cause for river curvature and meandering when the sediment load is less than the load capacity and bank erodibility permits it gives more general expressions for example for the channel radius of curvature as a function of not only the channel width but also of the channel roughness channel depth froude number and difference between the valley and regime channel slopes this is an improvement to the simple relations r b 2 4 and λ 6b as the newly developed equations provide more general framework by inclusion of more influencing variables other than the width the presented novel relations of the meander geometry variables are in terms of all the influential factors such as channel roughness width depth velocity water discharge and sediment discharge in addition a meander path model is developed and useful modifications of the classic sine generated curve are presented also the developed equations from the excess energy theory can be useful to meander migration modelling in addition explaining fluvial tidal meandering channel straightening and non alluvial meandering is made possible by the developed theory 2 development of the excess energy theory for river meandering the excess energy theory states when the sediment load is less than the channel sediment transporting capacity the river channel when confronted by a steep valley slope sv is the valley slope tries to maintain equilibrium or uniformity in energy expenditure by expending the excess energy this is done through curvature meandering development limited by bank resistance for which the induced curvature increases the energy loss and thus decreases the energy slope in other words the steeper valley slope relative to the regime channel slope sv sr where sr is the regime channel slope causes the river channel to meander or deform laterally or horizontally in order to increase the energy loss this leads to reduction of the energy slope and consequently the stream power if there is not enough sediment load to cause deposition and if the bank resistance allows for meander development therefore meander formation is a case of horizontal channel adjustment if there was enough sediment supply the river channel would try to restore its slope to the pre steepening conditions through sediment deposition vertical channel adjustment or deformation bank resistance on the other hand may limit the full development of meandering and in this case thalweg meandering might be an option for the river to spend the excess energy while large scale degradation would be another option thus meander formation depends on horizontal river channel adjustment while aggradation and degradation are cases of vertical river channel adjustments different combinations of all the above mechanisms with various degrees are also possible depending on the relative magnitudes of the influencing variables but scope is limited here only to meandering it should be noted that it is not the absolute value of the valley slope that determines meandering conditions but it is the difference between the valley and regime channel slopes sv sr which is the controlling factor if a valley slope is steep but the inflow quantities of water and sediment require high regime slope then the difference of slopes excess energy is negligible causing straight at low sediment load or braiding at high sediment load channel conditions to occur this may justify why there are no widespread meandering rivers in mountain landscapes where slopes are typically larger conversely if the inflow quantities of water and sediment require small regime slope then the difference of slopes excess energy could be significant and meandering conditions occur in order to expend this excess energy it should be emphasized that chang 1988 assumed uniformity in the water surface profile while in the developed theory herein uniformity of the excess energy is assumed which is more general in addition chang 1988 was pointing to the situation where the upstream channel is confronted by a downstream steep valley slope this special case can also be considered by the excess energy theory in this case the regime channel slope sr is taken equal to the upstream channel slope when using the excess energy theory equations developed hereinafter at very high floods during geologic time scales the alluvial valley is formed and the channel slope is nearly equal to the valley slope indicating straight planform it can be assumed in that case the energy loss slope friction slope is equal to the bed slope and hence no excess energy is available for meandering at such condition the river channel planform is nearly straight and the channel slope can be considered as the regime slope sr under the imposed flow and sediment discharges due to the high value of such floods the valley or channel slope is relatively high in order to transport the very large amounts of water and sediment discharges when this period of high floods is followed by periods of relatively low floods the river channel requires a regime slope that is less than the existing steep valley slope thus there is an excess energy for the river channel to spend in this case pittaluga and seminara 2011 in their investigation of effects of nonlinearity and unsteadiness on river meandering found a channel that is subjected to a repeated sequence of floods reaches a dynamic equilibrium if there is an increase in energy head excess energy there are two possible ways for the river channel to respond and restore the equilibrium conditions by absorbing the increase in energy one way is reducing the bed slope through sediment deposition or significant channel incision aggradation or degradation forming vertical channel adjustments and the second way is through increasing the energy loss via channel curvature and meandering development horizontal channel adjustment as was stated before according to schumm 1968 chang 1988 and da silva 2006 that in order to reduce the excess energy reduction of channel slope through incision would require tremendous degradation aggradation requires large amounts of sediment that could not be available and the river channel usually adjusts by developing a flatter slope through meandering this occurs when the sediment load is less than the transporting capacity so aggradation is not possible therefore quantification of the meandering process is dealt with in this study initially it is assumed that the valley and channel slopes were uniform and being equal to each other along the length of a river reach then for some reasons geologic or climatic or hydrologic or man made the regime slope of the channel sr required to transport the imposed water and sediment inflows is less than the steeper valley slope sv this causes the river channel to perform maximum stretching or lengthening through curving and meandering in order to spend the excess energy subjected to the constraints of sediment load and bank erodibility according to the excess energy theory the river channel will tend to curve or meander i e deviating from the straight path and taking a curved path when the sediment load is less than capacity and bank erodibility permits in this case based on physical reasoning and observations by past researchers leopold and wolman 1960 schumm 1968 chang 1988 and da silva 2006 the excess energy which is sv sr will be converted to transverse energy loss due to curvature this physically based statement is expressed in terms of the energy slopes as 3 s s v s r δ s where s is the transverse energy slope due to loss in energy induced by curvature and δ s is the difference in slopes between the steep valley slope sv and the relatively flat regime channel slope sr it should be noted that s is the slope of loss in energy mainly due to the internal fluid friction resulted from the transverse secondary current circulation and the transverse boundary shear eq 3 where all the terms have units of slope indicates that the excess energy due to an increase in the bed slope the valley slope is greater than the regime channel slope required to transport the inflows of water and sediment is dissipated through the tendency of the river channel to meander and consequently expending some energy loss upon doing the curving it should be noted that meandering occurs when there is a change of river regime which induces imbalance between the valley and regime channel slopes for every regime slope there is a certain meandering geometry and therefore meandering can occur even under uniform longitudinal river conditions when the regime channel slope is equal to the valley slope straight conditions will occur with the disappearance of meandering channel straightening conditions through increasing the wave length or formation of cutoffs eq 3 can be derived from the momentum conservation law as follows first consider the well known one dimensional steady saint venant equation the saint venant equation expresses conservation of the linear momentum in one dimension and is given by 4 u g d u d x d y d x s o s f δ s d d x u 2 2 g y where u is the cross sectional average longitudinal velocity g is the gravitational acceleration x is the longitudinal distance along the channel y is the water depth so is the bed slope sf is the energy loss slope friction slope and δ s is excess energy slope it is assumed that before the initiation of meandering the river channel reach is initially straight and under equilibrium or regime conditions the available water and sediment inflows to the reach are transported under the channel regime slope the channel energy loss slope must be equal to this regime slope i e sf sr this means that the energy lost is just the energy spent on transporting the water and sediment inflows by overcoming the channel resistance in addition it is clear that the channel bed slope in this case is equal to the valley bed slope i e so sv this means that the driving force for transporting the inflows of water and sediment is the channel slope gravitational flow which under straight planform conditions is equal to the valley slope when there is any imbalance of the water and sediment inflows the channel regime slope will change and formation of meandering or curved reach will be resulted in to accommodate this change the channel regime slope by definition is the slope at which water and sediment are transported along the channel for stable meanders under equilibrium conditions it follows that the energy loss slope is equal to the channel regime slope i e sf sr to illustrate that so sv consider a lab experiment in which an alluvial meandering channel exists on a longitudinally tilted flume under uniform or equilibrium conditions in this case the bed slope of the channel is the slope of the titled flume which controls velocity and depth gravitational effect slope of the tilted flume is similar to the valley slope and hence it can be stated that so sv therefore in the case of channel curvature and meandering it is still true that sf sr and so sv the quantity so sf in eq 4 and throughout herein will be made equal to sv sr i e so sf sv sr always the quantity so sf or its equivalent sv sr is defined here as the excess energy δ s if so sf sv sr 0 then the quantity u 2 2 g y specific energy should have a constant value along the river reach this establishes that when the regime slope is equal to the valley slope uniform specific energy condition along the river length is attained the river channel adjusts its velocity and depth accordingly to maintain this uniformity this confirms the validity of assuming uniform conditions it should be noted that the quantity sf which is considered here as the regime slope sr is the energy loss friction slope due to the bed skin roughness or friction it is usually termed as s and it is considered as the energy loss slope required to transporting the imposed water and sediment discharges along the river channel based on the above it can be considered that for straight channel river reaches 5 δ s s v s r s v s 0 this means that sv sr s at the straight channel condition now if there is a decrease in the inflow of water or sediment or channel roughness then the quantity s sr will accordingly decrease as less energy is required due to less water or sediment inflow or less channel roughness there will be imbalance between the valley slope and the channel regime slope and an excess energy exists δ s 0 as explained before this imbalance is absorbed through energy loss due to transverse circulation which occurs when the channel reach becomes curved or meandering i e tendency toward making the excess energy zero δ s 0 there will be transverse energy loss due to the transverse circulation with its slope called s in that case eq 4 becomes 6 δ s s v s s 0 o r s v s r s 0 eq 6 is equivalent to eq 3 and this equivalency and the derivation of eq 6 from the well known and the very established saint venant equation supports the validity of eq 3 at least conceptually it can also be stated that the excess energy theory is physically based as it was derived from the physical law of momentum conservation by saint venant equation it is well known that curvature meander formation induces secondary currents or circulation which causes the transverse energy loss rozovskii s 1957 or chang s 1988 approach can be used to express the transverse energy expenditure in curved reaches s via 7 s φ r d r 2 f 2 where φ r is a function representing the channel bed roughness r d is the channel axis water depth r is the radius of curvature of the channel axis and f is the flow froude number for uniform meander plan shape r should be the radius of curvature of the channel center line and for non uniform meander plan shape r should be the radius of curvature at the apex of the meandering pattern chang 1988 analytically developed an expression for the roughness function φ r in terms of the darcy weisbach friction factor i e r f and was given as 8 φ f 2 07 f 4 68 f 1 83 f 3 2 0 565 f rozovskii s 1957 friction function may be used in place of eq 8 in terms of the chezy coefficient r c as by 9 φ c 12 g c 30 g c 2 the chezy coefficient c is related to the friction factor f by c 8 g f substituting s from eq 7 while using r f into eq 3 and solving for r yields 10 r d f φ f δ s d f φ f s v s r in eq 10 and the equations to follow the friction factor is used as the roughness factor because it is dimensionless while the chezy s and manning s roughness coefficients have dimensions it should be noted also that eq 10 can be applied at any given local point along the meander path or applied to the whole meander loop in an average sense in the first case the variables in eq 10 are local values at any given point along the meander path where due to the non uniformity of these variables an irregular meander pattern would occur i e different r values result due to different friction water depth and velocity along the meander path therefore the dependency of the roughness coefficient flow depth and longitudinal velocity on the stream wise coordinate s seems to be the best option for inclusion of stream wise variability of r in the second case if the variables are selected as averages along the whole meander loop the radius of curvature will be the average radius of curvature and this implies treating the meander as a regular meander with circular shape the reason for the explicit absence of the stream wise curvilinear coordinate s in eq 10 is that the original equation eq 7 for the transverse energy loss does not contain the stream wise coordinate s because the analysis is made for a regular meander pattern it is beyond the scope of this work to find such relation for non regular meander pattern and this is left for future research therefore the dependency of the roughness coefficient flow depth and longitudinal velocity on the stream wise curvilinear coordinate s seems to be the best option for inclusion of stream wise variability eq 10 in dimensionless form becomes 11 r d f φ f δ s o r r d f φ f s v s r another dimensionless form of eq 11 in terms of r b the radius width ratio is 12 r b 1 b d f φ f s v s r eq 12 should be compared to eq 1 where the generality of eq 11 is more evident as r b depends now on the width depth ratio froude number channel roughness and slope imbalance the curvature of the curved meandering channel is 1 r can be obtained from eq 10 via 13 1 r 1 d 1 f δ s φ f o r 1 r 1 d 1 f s v s r φ f substituting f u g d in eq 13 yields 14 1 r g d 1 u δ s φ f o r 1 r g d 1 u s v s r φ f it is assumed in eq 14 that the channel is very wide hydraulic radius is similar to water depth for channels that are not wide the water depth is substituted by the hydraulic radius the regime or equilibrium channel slope sr can be calculated in different ways one way is directly through the regime equations such as by lacey 1958 via 15 s r 1 6 d 1 2 5 3 1830 q 1 6 where d is the median bed material size in millimeters and q is the flow discharge cfs chang 1988 used the bed load transport formula of duboys 1879 to evaluate the equilibrium channel slope sr via 16 q s q s b 0 173 d 4 3 γ r s r γ r s r τ c b where qs is the bed load sediment discharge qs is the unit bed load discharge d is the median bed size in millimeters γ is the water unit weight r is the channel hydraulic radius equals the water depth for very wide channels and τc is the critical shear stress for incipient motion the solution of this quadratic equation for sr is 17a s r τ c τ c 2 4 d 4 3 q s 0 173 2 γ r the plus sign should be used in eq 17a above as sr is by definition a positive quantity eq 17a shows the bed material properties through d and τ c the shields parameter through τ c the sediment load through qs and the flow depth through r affect the regime slope and consequently affect meander development assuming wide channel conditions allows replacing the hydraulic radius r in eq 17a by the average flow depth d solving for the flow depth from the manning s roughness equation n is the manning s roughness coefficient and substituting this in eq 17a results in 17b s r τ c τ c 2 4 d 4 3 q s 0 173 b 2 γ n 2 q 2 b 2 s 3 10 the right hand side in eq 17b includes many influencing variables on river meandering in this case effects of sediment load qs water discharge q channel width b the flow energy slope s which can be approximated by the water surface slope manning s roughness coefficient n critical shear stress τ c sediment size d and water unit weight γ on meander development are clear the changes of the inflows of water and sediment due to maybe geologic hydrologic climate change or man made activities such as deforestation urbanization and damming will thus affect directly sr and consequently affect river plan form as inferred from eq 10 17a and 17b for a given sediment load or water discharge and all the other variables in eqs 17a and 17b are also known the equilibrium slope sr is calculated and if it is less than the valley slope then curvature or meandering would occur subjected to bank resistance constraints thus the excess energy theory provides a basis for determining the initiation of meandering if sr from eqs 17a and 17b is greater than the valley slope no curvature meandering would occur and cutoff conditions might happen or braiding conditions if sr is equal to the valley slope then the river channel reach would be straight in this way the slope difference sv sr determines the inception or initiation of meandering which is similar to the incipient motion criteria for bed sediment particles movement τ τc thus the excess energy theory provides criterion for meander inception the advantage of the present approach is that the inflows of water and sediment discharges are included in the determination of the regime slope in this way the effects of climate change and man made activities which influence the water and sediment discharges on the river channel plan form can be investigated of course other sediment transport formulas than the one by duboys 1879 can be used as well all parameters or factors that will affect the regime channel slope will in turn affect the meander parameters as suggested by the proposed approach therefore the link is established between the controlling variables of water and sediment discharges channel roughness the river channel longitudinal regime slope valley slope and meander plan form a meander path model can be obtained by recognizing the mathematical definition of the curvature which can be given according to swokowski et al 1994 by 18 1 r d θ ds where θ is the angle that the meander path at a given point makes with the mean down path direction and s is a length coordinate along the meander path s is a curvilinear coordinate substituting 1 r from eq 14 into eq 18 rearranging and integrating yield 19a θ o θ d θ 0 s g d 1 u s v s r φ f d s or 19b θ o θ d θ 0 s 1 f s v s r φ f d s where in eq 19a θo is the initial angle the meander path makes with the mean down path direction when the variations of the depth velocity friction factor and sr are known along the meander path a general meander path model is obtained and the degree of irregularity of meandering would depend on the irregularity of the variation of these variables in eq 19b the length coordinate s is made dimensionless using s s d with the result of the appearance of the froude number f the dimensionless eq 19b is applicable to one meander loop as pointed out before the variables f u and d in eq 19a often vary along the meander path the stream wise variability would result in an irregular meander pattern if these variables are uniform a regular meander pattern would occur the sign in eqs 19a or 19b would produce θ values greater than θo along the distance from s m 4 to s 3 m 4 where m is the total arc length along the meander path and the sign would produce θ values less than θo from distance zero to s m 4 and from distance s 3 m 4 to s m after developing the equation for predicting channel radius of curvature and a meander path model attention is now given to finding channel sinuosity sinuosity is defined here as the ratio of valley slope to channel slope chang 1988 i e ω sv sr where ω is the channel sinuosity this can be seen by noting that ω can be written as equal to cl vl δh vl δh cl where δh is the energy drop along the meander path this gives sinuosity as the ratio of valley slope δh vl to channel slope δh cl expressing sinuosity in terms of slopes rather than lengths has the advantage as will be seen hereinafter that through the channel slope sr the influencing variables of velocity width depth roughness flow and sediment discharges are included one can consider that the length defined sinuosity is a geometrical definition while the slope defined sinuosity is a dynamic definition eq 13 can be rewritten as 20 1 r 1 d 1 f s v s r φ f 1 r 1 d 1 f s r s v s r 1 φ f eq 20 in terms of the sinuosity ω can be written as 21 1 r 1 d 1 f s r ω 1 φ f eq 21 is solved for ω resulting in 22 ω 1 d r 2 f 2 1 s r φ f substituting f2 sr 8 f in eq 22 where all quantities refer to channel conditions results in 23 ω 1 d r 2 8 f φ f eq 23 gives the river channel sinuosity in terms of the channel depth radius ratio and the friction factor because eq 23 was derived from eq 13 the two equations are not independent to eliminate the usually unknown radius of curvature r appearing in eq 23 the following equation by chang 1988 can be used 24 r b 2 2 0 15 b d 4 eq 24 was developed theoretically based on chang s energy approach with the channel radius width ranges from 2 2 to 4 while the channel width depth ranges from 4 to 16 eq 24 is multiplied by b d to give 25 r d 2 2 b d 0 15 b d b d 4 the right hand side of eq 25 can be written as 26 r d ψ b d 2 2 b d 0 15 b d b d 4 where ψ b d is a function of b d given as by eq 26 substituting for r d from eq 26 into eq 23 yields 27 ω 1 1 ψ b d 2 8 f φ f eq 27 gives the river channel sinuosity in terms of the channel width depth ratio and the friction factor these two quantities are usually easily known from field data it should be noted that eqs 22 and 23 give the more general equation for sinuosity in which effects of the most significant controlling variables on sinuosity are included such as the regime slope sr velocity u and depth d and hence the discharge u and d are given by the froude number f eq 27 is a simplified form for practical purposes due to data availability the meander arc length m was found by chang 1984 from his mathematical meander path model to be a function of the depth and channel roughness independent of channel curvature or arc angle the dimensionless m d was inversely related to channel roughness as given in table 1 and shown also in fig 3 data in table 1 can be fitted to give the following equation for m d as 28 m d 50 73 f 0 45 the r2 value from the regression analysis of the data in table 1 is 0 9989 since sinuosity m λ then the following equation can be written for the dimensionless wave length as 29a λ d 50 73 f 0 45 1 d r 2 8 f φ f 50 73 f 0 45 1 1 ψ b d 2 8 f φ f eq 29a expresses the dimensionless meander wave length λ d as a function of the channel roughness friction factor and the width depth ratio both sides in eq 29a are divided by b d to obtain 29b λ b 50 73 f 0 45 b d 1 d r 2 8 f φ f 50 73 f 0 45 b d 1 1 ψ b d 2 8 f φ f indeed eq 29b offers a more general representation of the dimensionless channel wave length than that by eq 2 because the effects of channel width depth ratio and roughness could be seen if a circular path is assumed to the curved meandering channel its maximum wave length will occur when the meandering channel is exactly two opposite half circles in one cycle this indicates that the maximum wave length λmax 4 r which compares with λ 4 7 r by leopold and wolman 1957 if r 2 4b is used then λmax 9 6 b which is close to the estimates of λ 10 b by leopold and wolman 1957 it is well known that the leopold and wolman 1957 relationship was derived by correlating data from many meanders and therefore it represents an average indicator thus the results using the assumption of circular arcs or regular meander pattern is not far from previous findings from field data substituting eq 10 for r in λmax 4 r yields 30 λ m a x 4 d f φ f s v s r eq 30 offers a more general expression than by eq 2 for the wavelength by taking several factors in influencing the meander wavelength the sine generated curve by langbein and leopold 1966 is given as 31 θ θ o sin 2 π s m eq 28 can be used to substitute for m in eq 31 and after rearranging one obtains 32 θ θ o sin 2 π f 0 45 50 73 d s eq 32 is an improvement of the sine generated curve as now effects of channel depth and friction factor are included the needed data such as channel friction factor and depth on the right hand side of eq 32 are usually easy to find instead of the hard to calculate arc length m which is required in the equation by langbein and leopold 1966 if a circular or regular meander is assumed then at a distance s m 4 the angle θ would be zero eq 19 at this condition becomes 33 θ o 0 d θ 0 m 4 g d 1 u s v s r φ f d s assuming the integrand on the right hand side of eq 33 to be constant with respect to s carrying out the integration and solving for the initial arc angle θ o yield 34 θ o g d 1 u s v s r φ f m 4 50 73 g d 4 u s v s r φ f f 0 45 eq 34 can be substituted in the modified sine generated curve given in eq 32 to the best of the author s knowledge there has not been any equation to predict the initial arc angle only eq 34 offers this the original or current form of the sine generated curve has disadvantages that the initial arc angle and the meander length θ o and m which are required as an input data for use in the sine curve are not known a priori these disadvantages are now overcome by the excess energy theory which provides predictions to those two variables resulting in all the influencing hydraulic and roughness variables to appear explicitly in the modified sine curve the sine generated curve is thus transformed from a geometrically based curve to a physically based curve 3 theoretical results related to the excess energy theory eq 10 indicates that channels characterized by high froude numbers have higher radius of curvature more straight and lower sinuous channels having more friction have higher radius of curvature more straight and lower sinuous and channels having larger difference between the valley and regime channel slopes have smaller radius of curvature and are more sinuous such information is evident from field observations as shown in knighton 1984 and chang 1988 these findings could not be inferred from the simple relation in eq 1 eq 12 establishes a more general form for the channel radius width ratio than is given by eq 1 if eq 12 is applied while assuming that the valley slope is 3 times the channel slope as can be seen in the data by schumm 1968 the friction factor is assumed 0 4 resulting in a friction function φ f with a value approximately as 3 0 the channel gradient is assumed 0 0001 the width depth ratio is assumed 10 and the froude number is assumed in the typical range between 0 2 and 0 3 this yields r b from 2 to 3 this finding is in agreement with the field observations by leopold et al 1964 williams 1986 chang 1988 and the sine generated curve the following observations can be made from eqs 10 13 and 14 if sr is equal to sv then channel curvature 1 r would be zero or alternatively r indicating perfectly straight river reach if sr is slightly less than sv then r will be very large and sinuosity would be small the more the difference or imbalance between sv and sr the more channel curvature and meandering in agreement with field observations this establishes that the imbalance between the valley slope and channel regime slope is the cause of channel curvature and meandering maximum curvature or fully developed meandering occurs when the quantity sv sr is at maximum this may occur according to eq 17b when the bed sediment load qs is zero i e near clear water conditions this indicates that when there is no sediment inflow small energy slope is needed just to carry water this situation resembles conditions downstream of dams that trap sediments where it is observed the river channel becomes more sinuous compared to the pre dam conditions chang 1988 parallel to the above point it is seen that channel curvature 1 r is directly proportional to the square root of the difference between the valley and regime channel slopes the steeper the valley slope with respect to the regime channel slope the more curved is the river channel the case of the chippewa river schumm and beathard 1976 supports that finding where the upper meandering reach between durand to eau claire had a flatter channel slope of 0 000278 and a steeper valley slope of 0 000333 with a sinuosity of 1 45 channel curvature is inversely proportional to the square root of friction as φ f is monotonically increasing function as seen in fig 4 channels with smooth beds or less friction tend to curve more than channels with rougher beds with more friction this is because more friction increases the longitudinal energy loss s leaving less excess energy to be dissipated through curvature and meandering for example sand bed channels under flat bed conditions become more curved or meandering than gravel bed channels for the same bed material type the coarsening of the bed material particles reduces channel curvature channel curvature 1 r is inversely proportional to velocity u as seen in eq 14 high velocity or discharge conditions assuming no bank over flow conditions may eliminate or reduce meandering or curvature of the channel which explains the occurrence of channel straightening of meandering river reaches this may occur for example due to increase of flows resulting from deforestation or climate change with increased flooding or high flow release downstream of dams under high velocity or high flows the river channel seeks to increase its energy slope in order to be able to transport the increased inflows of water and sediment in contrary to this river reaches downstream of dams will tend to be more sinuous in case of water discharge and sediment load reduction as also stated by chang 1988 increase of water discharges with associated increase in velocity would also lead to straightening of the thalweg navigation channel meandering which occur inside straight river reaches with rigid or non erosive banks for wide rectangular channels with constant discharge and constant channel width velocity is inversely proportional to water depth i e u α 1 d or 1 u α d substituting this in eq 14 results in 1 r d i e deeper channels become more meandering but with a slow rate due to the square root variation than shallow channels under constant discharge and width conditions for wide rectangular channels with constant discharge and constant water depth velocity is inversely proportional to channel width i e u α 1 b or 1 u α b where b is the channel width substituting this in eq 14 results in 1 r b i e wide channels become more meandering than narrow channels but this occurs under constant discharge constant water depth conditions and free migrating meander conditions this may delineate the observation by da silva and ebrahimi 2017 that alluvial meandering streams are usually rather wide channels the excess energy theory may explain the process of channel straightening as follows if the inflows of water and sediment discharges are high enough to cause high channel regime slope sr in order to transport the water and sediment then sr could approach the valley slope sv 1 r s v s r in this case according to eq 14 1 r approaches zero indicating a nearly straight channel path whether channel straightening of a meander reach occurs through change of fluvial style significant increase in the wave length toward a straight channel path or through cutoff process either neck cutoff or chute cutoff as long as bank erosion permits that depends on the relative magnitudes of all the variables and is left for further research constantine et al 2014 based on landsat imagery spanning 1985 2013 concluded that imposed sediment loads influence planform changes in lowland rivers across the amazon they found that rivers with higher sediment loads experience higher annual migration rates and more frequent occurrence of meander cutoffs ielpi et al 2021 investigated cutoff kinematics along the humboldt river nevada a stream that from 1994 to 2019 hosted an exceptionally high number of cutoffs they found that a coincidence between major floods and cutoff incidence is first suggestive of hydrographic modulation the developed theory answers the question which was raised by da silva 2006 about why meanders occur even when there is no sediment transport such as at meltwater channels of surface glaciers and the gulf stream as what is required for meandering is existence of excess energy even if the sediment load is zero for alluvial channels with no sediment transport eq 10 and eqs 17a and 17b include the possibility of having zero bed load and yet occurrence of meandering is possible due to existence of excess energy sv sr where sr τc γ r for non alluvial channels such as meltwater channels of surface glaciers and the gulf stream the equilibrium or regime slope sr is the energy slope which can be given according to non alluvial channels resistance formulas such as manning s or chezy s equations in this case the channel adjusts its longitudinal regime slope sr to accommodate or transport the given quantity of water discharge simply any stream even if it has a small flow which flows under gravity requires energy slope calculated for example from a roughness formula such as manning s formula to flow which is the regime slope if the slope of the plane on which this stream flows similar to the valley slope in fluvial streams is greater than the regime slope there would be excess energy to spend and this energy expenditure is done through curving and meandering of the stream in order to illustrate the use of eq 14 a hypothetical river reach is assumed with d 5 m u 1 m s and sr 6 10 5 the resulting darcy weisbach friction factor becomes f 0 0235 and φ f 1 057 table 2 shows the prediction by eq 14 of the radius of curvature of the hypothetical meandering channel resulting from slope imbalance between the valley and regime slopes δs interestingly table 2 shows for very small slope difference δs 0 001 10 5 the radius of curvature is 7340 m a nearly straight plan form while when the slope difference is relatively large as 10 10 5 the radius of curvature is 73 m very sharp bend a ratio of 100 times fold is there between the radii of curvatures in these two cases this indicates that the excess energy theory can predict not only highly curvature and meandering conditions but also channel straightening conditions needles to stress the importance of the constraints of sediment availability and bank resistance which in real life might have considerable effects in real life the slope imbalance increase could be for example due to valley steepening or improper design of a canal slope where the bed slope is steeper than the equilibrium regime bed slope or increase of the navigational channel slope after dredging or occurrence of a meander cutoff in a high flood year followed by low flood in the next year eqs 23 and 27 for the sinuosity indicate the following inverse variation of sinuosity against width depth ratio is clear from eq 27 as also noted in schumm s 1968 data from the great plains rivers murrumbidgee river australia and prior stream victoria australia according to eq 27 if the width depth ratio approaches infinity theoretically speaking or has a very large value field conditions sinuosity would approach unity indicating a straight plan form river channel sinuosity increases non linearly with increasing channel depth decreases non linearly with increasing channel width and with increasing channel radius of curvature in accordance with the findings of knighton 1984 chang 1988 stated that rivers with a small width depth ratio or channel roughness or both can be more sinuous which can also be inferred from eq 23 noting that φ f f versus f is a decreasing function as seen in fig 5 da silva and ebrahimi 2017 addressed the importance when investigating either experimentally or numerically the mechanics of alluvial meandering stream to a priori reflect on the plan shape and width to depth ratio it should be noted that eq 23 can be written as 35 ω 1 s s where s is the longitudinal energy loss slope due to skin friction which in addition can also include bed form resistance it can be assumed that s is equal to sr eq 35 can be a quick way for determining the transverse energy loss slope given the channel sinuosity from aerial maps or satellite images and the longitudinal channel slope eq 35 indicates that sinuosity can have different values depending on the ratio of s s for straight river reaches where no curvature occurs s 0 and therefore sinuosity would be exactly equal to 1 0 according to eq 35 chang 1983 states that the transverse velocity component in meandering channels is generally lower than the longitudinal or primary velocity but such is not the case for the energy expenditure he added that the loss due to transverse circulation may be of the same order of magnitude as the longitudinal loss at a higher depth to radius ratio or lower channel roughness or both camporeale et al 2007 reviewed the importance of the physical mechanisms involved in river meandering by comparing some existing linear models and extensions thereof the analysis of the models shows the importance of the closure of secondary currents especially in the modeling of eddy viscosity the close connection between the secondary currents and the transverse energy loss cause effect relation supports the role that the transverse energy loss plays in river meandering as a surrogate variable to the secondary currents if s is equal to s as could be inferred according to chang 1983 sinuosity will then become equal to 2 0 this is the case of equality of the longitudinal and transverse energy losses grime 2015 reported that the average sinuosity of 258 rivers was found to be 1 94 which is close to 2 0 if it is argued that grime s finding was based on crowed sourced data which could come from rivers that maybe impacted by man made activities the large number of data points 258 is nonetheless very large enough for accepting this postulate 4 theory application using field and mathematical modeling data chang 1988 stated that it is rare to find complete river data required for comparison with his analytical equations for meandering which is the case also with the equations developed herein this is due to the fact that published data about plan geometry of sinuous streams seldom contains valuable information such as channel roughness and flow parameters although these are the most basic data the author finds this true up to now as researchers focused on satellite images which show the geometrical meander variables in addition to channel width such as for example in ielpi and lapôtre 2020 they selected channel width to reflect channel size unfortunately no data were recorded for channel depth discharge slope and roughness williams 1986 presented 48 valuable data points but showing only the channel cross sectional and meander features without flow discharge and channel roughness howard and hemberger 1991 in their multivariate characterization of meanders used 40 morphometric variables that have been measured on 57 sections of freely meandering channels from 33 rivers these objective variables are computed from digitized traces of the channel centerline and include measures of sinuosity meander wave length curvature moments meander asymmetry and pattern irregularity unfortunately hydraulic variables and roughness data were not collected in addition lazarus and constantine 2013 compiled sinuosity data for 20 rivers all over the world but in terms of valley slope and flood plain manning s roughness coefficient recently finotello et al 2020 collected a remotely sensed planforms of about 10 000 fluvial and tidal meanders worldwide they considered four main variables of sinuosity intrinsic wave length curvature and asymmetry index in spite of all these detailed data no hydraulic and roughness data were collected in summary complete data even on the average scale of one meander loop are hard to find let alone any local data in which channel roughness and flow variables change along the meander path river data as an averages over meander bends seen in table 3 was compiled by ponce 1976 and schumm 1968 with measured sinuosity ω width depth ratio b d and friction factor f the data are sorted according to the width depth ratio interestingly the data shows that sinuosity is inversely proportional to the width depth ratio as also can be seen from eq 27 these data are used for comparison with the present approach prediction equation eq 27 the data by ponce were measured from three of the link canals in pakistan these canals are essentially straight sand bed channels with a meandering thalweg and they all have width depth ratio of 24 the other set of data for meandering rivers compiled by schumm include 12 rivers in the midwestern united states three murrumbidgee river sections and one ancestral river section these rivers have flat slopes non braided channel pattern and width depth ratios between 4 and 21 the friction factor ranges from 0 025 smooth bed channels to 0 4 rough bed channels it should be noted that the data by ponce 1976 is based on large sample of wave lengths from each canal to determine the predominant mode wavelength of the thalweg while schumm 1968 data are at river cross sections table 3 shows the results of applying eq 27 for calculating sinuosity supplemented by using either eqs 8 or 9 for the friction function both approaches give very close results to the field data with the predictions using eq 8 being relatively better the close predictions by both friction functions illustrate near independency of the results on the equation selected for the friction function the maximum absolute relative error was 8 in case of using eq 8 and 14 in case of using eq 9 one possible source of the errors in the use of eqs 8 or 9 is that they are developed for steady and uniform flow conditions in actual river cases conditions could be different i e unsteady and non uniform however the small magnitude of the errors suggests the validity of this approximation the agreement with field data could be considered excellent in both approaches as seen also from figs 6 and 7 where most points are close to the line of perfect agreement thus the agreement with these field data of natural rivers supports the proposed theory interestingly table 3 shows the excess energy theory is able to predict wide range of sinuosity values as predicting large sinuosity meanders ω 2 37 and 2 2 to sinuosity values close to unity ω 1 01 and 1 02 this indicates that the excess energy theory can predict not only highly curvature and meandering conditions but also channel straightening conditions using the same equation table 4 shows that there is a good agreement between the prediction by eq 29a versus the measured dimensionless channel wave length λ d the data are sorted according to the friction factor table 4 also shows that there is no noticeable difference between the predictions using either of the friction functions although eq 28 which was incorporated into eq 29a was developed using only six data values the good match between eq 29a predictions and the field data is very promising keeping in mind the complexity of the meandering phenomenon some errors are as high as 44 but many are below 17 eq 2 after multiplying λ b by b d to obtain λ d highly under predicts the wave length and its prediction errors reaches 70 the superiority of eq 29a which is based on the excess energy theory over the regime equation eq 2 is evident from table 4 table 5 shows the predicted by eq 29b versus measured dimensionless wave length λ b the dimensionless measured values of λ d were divided by b d to obtain λ b like the last case good agreement with the field data is also obtained by using eq 29b chang 1984 developed a meander path mathematical model based on the equation of motion for transverse circulation in channels the scale parameter arc length was analytically determined from the channel length required for the decay and growth of the transverse circulation therefore only the shape parameter arc angle or curvature at apex was needed to be specified for a given radius of channel curvature at the apex and other required quantities the depth velocity friction factor f the meander path was obtained by solving the general equation for the spatial variation of the transverse surface velocity along the meander path using the method of finite differences chang 1984 presented sample regular meander paths using his mathematical model which are shown in table 6 along with the present approach predictions using eq 23 in using eq 23 the data about the friction factor and r d provided by chang 1984 were used it is noted that the data included the depth radius ratio and therefore eq 23 was used directly good agreement between the two approaches is obtained except at the very sharp bend where r d was as low as 15 and flow separation might be expected 5 discussion eqs 3 and 10 hold locally at any given point along the meander path or along the whole path in an average sense when considering the first situation eq 10 can be rewritten as 36 r t s 1 g u t s d t s φ f t s s v s r t s 1 g d t s q t s b t s φ f t s s v s r t s where t is time s is the curvilinear distance along the meander path q is the water discharge and the valley slope is assumed being constant the notation t s means dependence of the variables upon space and time thus eq 36 allows for considering unsteady and non uniform conditions when eq 36 is applied at two consecutive times t1 and t2 and at a given point the change in the channel radius of curvature over time is obtained i e δ r s r t 2 s r t 1 s the quantity δ r s represents meander development over time at a given location which is similar to the bank change for lateral meander migration δ r s also represents lateral bank shift the effect of water discharge q and sediment load through sr in eq 17a b provides the link between the hydrologic variables of water and sediment discharges and the meander shape variables further research is needed for validation of this work for channels with higher width depth ratios where an equation other than eq 24 is needed eq 24 was reported by chang 1988 for maximum width depth ratio of 16 for river cases with width depth ratio of 24 used in this study eq 24 was assumed still applicable i e it was extrapolated in lack of another alternative the foregoing analysis assumed that the river banks are free to move so the river banks are not constituting a limiting value for river meandering this occurs if the river banks resistance to erosion is relatively low when the river banks have high relative resistance to erosion this will limit the formation of fully developed meanders or may force the river channel to follow an irregular path dictated by the local topography and bank resistance in this case the river channel might migrate in the downstream direction searching for weaker banks to erode while consuming the excess energy using eq 7 along with eqs 8 or 9 which were developed as transverse resistance equations under steady and uniform flow conditions should not pose significant problem in investigating meandering under unsteady and non uniform conditions this is similar to using the longitudinal flow resistance formulas such as manning s darcy weisbach s and chezy s equations in flow and sediment models when investigating unsteady and non uniform conditions although these formulas were developed under steady and uniform flow conditions this has been well accepted and is a common practice approach it is also similar to using bed load and sediment transport formulas in unsteady and non uniform water and sediment models while these formulas were developed under steady and uniform flow conditions various researchers in their dynamic meandering modeling studies have used the uniform flow formulas such as schwenk et al 2015 bogoni et al 2017 monegaglia and tubino 2019 and ielpi et al 2021 in other words the use of these equations locally and instantaneously is a valid assumption and justified due to the small errors resulting from comparing the theoretical results by the theory and actual field conditions which are assumed to be changing gradually the case of tidally influenced river mouths and or estuaries could be considered herein when there is a downstream control such as the existence of a sea level also a lake or a reservoir the slope of river reach further upstream of the sea often will be greater than the downstream reach adjacent to the sea in the case where there is not enough sediment supply and no or little bank resistance the river channel will tend to meander in the downstream reach the tidally influenced reach to consume the excess energy coming from the upstream alluvial reach in case of existence of enough sediment formation of a delta will occur to consume the excess energy and reduce the slope between these two cases possible combination of fluvial tidal river meandering and deltaic formation is possible further explanation of fluvial tidal influenced river mouths and or estuaries is given as follows the river reach further upstream of the sea has high momentum or high energy high energy slope and where the river meets the sea it would have small momentum or small energy due to collision with the sea water a transition zone must therefore exist between the zone of high energy and the zone of small energy at the sea the river is trying to stop or slow down as if the river is trying to push the brakes before reaching the sea and it needs enough friction to do that however enough friction might not always be available if there is not enough friction the river channel would try to dissipate its excess energy through meandering thus forming a fluvial tidal meandering river reach this meandering is constrained by bank resistance and sediment availability the following hypothetical numerical example is given as an illustration suppose the fluvial tidal meandering reach has length of 40 km and energy head of 1 2 m i e assuming at 40 km upstream of the sea the river is at 1 2 m 120 cm stage above the mean sea level and assuming also that the velocity head is small so the energy head is equal to the river stage the river reach needs then 3 cm km of energy expenditure to reach to the sea 120 cm 40 km 3 cm km assuming further that longitudinal resistance grain and form roughness in this tidally influenced reach produces an energy loss slope friction slope of 2 cm km this results in excess energy of 1 cm km to spend before reaching to the sea one possible way of energy expenditure is through meandering and in this case the transverse energy slope needed for equilibrium would be 1 cm km i e the ratio of s s 0 5 sinuosity would be 1 5 according to eq 35 in this case 0 8 m of energy head is spent on longitudinal resistance while 0 4 m is spent on transverse resistance due to meandering eq 10 for fluvial meandering could be applied in the case of fluvial tidal meandering this is done by the replacement of the valley slope sv by the steep slope of the upstream channel reach and the regime channel slope sr is replaced by the flat slope of the downstream tidally influenced meandering reach it should be noted that in fluvial tidal meandering the excess energy comes from differences or imbalances in energy through the longitudinal profile along the river spatial differences while the excess energy in case of fluvial meandering as in eq 10 comes from differences in energy through time variations due to changing flow and sediment conditions from one flood episode to another or from one flow regime to another temporal differences in either case this excess energy has to be consumed by forming a meandering curved channel in the absence of abundant sediment load and the extent of curvature meandering is limited by bank erodibility da silva 2006 reported that from the debates on meandering theories eventually the idea settled that any theory should explain i why the wave length of meanders λ 6b and ii why meanders occur even when there is no sediment transport such as at meltwater channels of surface glaciers and the gulf stream firstly indeed λ 6b is an oversimplification and eq 29b and eq 30 offer a more general relation of the channel wavelength where many important factors affect the wavelength as well as the channel width in other words the relation λ 6b could be considered as a special case of either of eq 29b and eq 30 table 5 shows measured values of λ b very different from 6 reaching as high as about λ b 21 so λ b 6 should be considered with caution the data in table 5 suggests that λ b 6 could be taken as a minimum value subjected to further research confirmation secondly the developed approach herein does not require the existence of sediment transport as meander occurrence is induced by the difference between the valley slope and the regime channel slope it should be noted that the formulation allows either the existence of sediment transport or also non existance of sediment transport at all when there is sediment transport the effects of sediment inflows as an upstream boundary condition appears in the determination of the channel regime slope as shown in eqs 17a and 17b eq 17a and 17b allow also for zero sediment transport in meandering channels for non alluvial channels the regime slope is the slope from resistance formulas such as manning s equation which is required to transport the water or the fluid da silva 2006 noted that past researchers used a minimization of some energy related quantity to which the stream adjusts its channel geometry including the plan form geometry for example chang 1988 used the stream power γ q s yang et al 1981 used the unit stream power u s yalin 1992 used the flow froude number and yalin and da silva 2001 used the average velocity u however in the present approach direct energy balance is used without resorting to minimization techniques which are complicated and often require computer programming the topic of optimal transport networks needs sophisticated mathematical tools such as a variational approach see e g birnir et al 2001 and chen et al 2014 to obtain reliable results a correction factor c ω can be added to eq 35 that accounts for effects of bank resistance and compensates for the assumptions or simplifications made herein eq 35 can be written as 37 ω 1 c ω s s the correction factor c ω can be determined based on fitting actual meander sinuosity data to s s similarly when the second term on the right hand side of eqs 23 and 27 is multiplied by a suitable correction coefficient cω to account for the simplifications and assumptions made herein this will shift the analysis from idealized regular meanders to natural irregular meanders further research is recommended for selecting such coefficient based on large river data sets eq 37 can be derived from the definition of meander sinuosity which can be written as follows 38 ω c l v l v l δ c l v l 1 δ c l v l 1 m λ λ where δ c l cl vl is the excess of the curved length than the straight channel length it can be assumed that the length in each path of the channel is proportional to the corresponding energy loss slope in other words the excess curved length δ c l is proportional to the transverse energy loss due to curvature and the straight length λ is proportional to longitudinal energy slope loss thus eq 38 can be written as 39 ω 1 m λ λ 1 c 1 s c 2 s 1 c ω s s where c1 and c2 are constants of the proportionality and c1 c2 cω eq 39 is identical to eq 37 and its derivation from the basic definition of the sinuosity of meandering channels supports the equations derived from the excess energy theory and consequently supports the excess energy theory itself some theories assume that it takes small perturbation or deviation or small flow curvature to generate river meandering for example howard and knutson 1984 assumed that when there is flow curvature bank erosion will start and meandering growth will take place and develop they assumed then bank erosion to depend on r b radius width ratio however what really drives r to begin with what is the mechanism that generates flow curvature in the first place they started from straight channel and superimposed on it small random perturbations to produce meandering channel pattern also bogoni et al 2017 in their meander morphodynamic model applied perturbations in the transverse direction to straight channel with small random fluctuations assuming they are normally distributed with zero mean and standard deviation as 0 01 of half the width no physical mechanism or physical law exists behind these perturbations which are artificially induced in the form of statistical or mathematical functions in this way the real causes or the origins of river meandering are not addressed differences between causes and effects results should be carefully understood here flow curvature and bank erosion are effects or results from the mechanism that initiates the meandering process most theories on meandering emphasize some special phenomena observed in meandering channels and neglect the physical meaning which creates them yang s 1971 in general all the theories can explain how the meandering rivers continue to meander but fail to explain how meanders initiate khatsuria 2010 the excess energy theory is really addressing the above issue as it advocates that when there is a difference between the valley slope and the regime channel slope this would be the driving or initiating mechanism for river meandering and this is the triggering mechanism for starting flow curvature bank erosion and meandering in order to consume the excess energy through transverse energy loss therefore bank erosion based models do not explain the causes of river meandering however these models are very useful tools in describing the meandering process itself and its development over time after its initiation bank erosion should be understood that it is a constraint on river meandering not a cause of meandering nor it is a meandering sustaining mechanism for if the banks are extremely weak occurrence of freely complete meandering might not necessarily happen as the process is governed by different mechanisms such as the flow and sediment conditions also if the banks are extremely rigid and the flow and sediment conditions require meandering then according to bank erosion methods nothing would happen this is in spite that flow curvature might take place and meandering of the thalweg is one possibility while formation of alternate bars if sediment exists is another possibility since the excess energy theory provides meander initiation while bank erosion or river meander dynamic models provide the tools for simulating meander development with time the two could be integrated together the excess energy theory can aid such models as by providing them with an analytical relation for the channel radius of curvature in terms of the meandering generating mechanism sv sr roughness and flow variables velocity discharge width depth and sediment load it might be argued that perfectly straight flows in nature are rare because some small topographic irregularities always exist and this would suffice in creating flow instabilities the same question by the author is still valid what is are the cause s of these small topographic irregularities what caused them how did they originate whether these perturbations are due to some physical small topographic irregularities or mathematical or statistical functions in all these cases there are unexplained initial perturbations which were created in the form of micro meandering shape like a sine curve with very small amplitude the excess energy solves this paradox by showing that starting from a perfectly straight line path meander inception could be generated due to the slope imbalance sv sr the argument should be that any theory on the cause of river meandering should start with a perfect straight line and looks for ways to generate a curving or meandering path in fact the excess energy theory does this perfectly it complements previous theories by providing a cause of river meandering which is the difference of the valley and regime slopes sv sr for very small sv sr then according to eq 10 the radius of curvature will have a value and this could be the cause for these small perturbations needed in river migration models interestingly also the same result could be obtained from eq 30 for sv sr 0 λmax would be infinity perfect straight line as sv sr increases slightly above zero λmax would start to have a large value which creates a perturbed channel with very small amplitude r is also large with the increase of the slope difference λmax and r would decrease creating the typical meander shape curve note this analysis could not be made with the classic equation λ 6b finally it should be emphasized that eq 3 constitutes the excess energy theory model for curvature meandering equations like eqs 7 and 8 for the transverse energy loss or eqs 17a and 17b for the regime slope required for transporting a given water and sediment discharge or eq 24 for expressing curvature ratio r b in terms of the width depth ratio b d are just auxiliary or closure equations to eq 3 in addition eq 28 is developed as a closure equation to facilitate the prediction of the meander wave length these auxiliary equations were used to allow for workable or applicable equations that can be compared to the corresponding equations developed by previous researchers and also to obtain form of equations that permit comparison with field data to reemphasize on the limitation of these equations eqs 7 and 8 chang 1988 for the transverse energy loss are based on the assumption of wide rectangular cross section super elevation and transverse variations of the longitudinal and transverse velocities are not considered and a linear vertical distribution of the transverse velocity is assumed eq 16 as a bed load equation has the well known limitations of bed load equations as that it is developed for uniform sediment mixture and wide rectangular channels under steady and uniform flow conditions eq 24 is reported to be applicable to width depth ratios less than 16 so further testing is needed for rivers that are wider than this ratio eq 28 is based on the model results of chang 1984 meander path model which is applicable to non braided rivers with uniform width and mean depth further research in the context of applicability of these closure equations to the excess energy theory is recommended to either support the use of these equations or to find better applicable equations as the source of the excess energy theory equations is the saint venant steady one dimensional equation and also the fact that the auxiliary relations are also one dimensionally based the most significant limitations of the excess energy theory are those due to the one dimensional assumption in other words all the considered variables herein such as the depth width velocity discharge and roughness are only allowed to vary along the channel centerline therefore the developed excess energy theory cannot account for transverse variations of the influencing variables for example such as depth or roughness lateral variation the theory gives the final equilibrium meandering geometry without determining the time needed to reach final equilibrium conditions on the other hand the time needed to reach equilibrium conditions can be determined by meander dynamic models 6 conclusions this study provides a physically based theory of river curvature and meandering based on the concept of excess energy the excess energy theory is based onphysical reasoning solid mathematical foundation the saint venant equation and field observations unlike earlier theoretical papers this approach does not require an optimization i e minimization or maximization of a particular hydraulic property it is shown herein by the excess energy theory that the imbalance between the valley and the regime channel slopes is the primary cause of river curvature meandering when the sediment load is less than the load transporting capacity and bank erodibility permits the theory is based on the assumption that if the sediment supply is less than the channel sediment transporting capacity and bank erodibility permits river channels curve or meander in order to maintain uniformity in energy expenditure when confronted by steep valley slopes by expending the excess energy through formation of curved channel reach an advantage of this approach is that the inflows of the hydrologic variables of water and sediment discharges are included in the determination of the regime slope which in turn affects meander geometry and this opens the doors for investigating effects of climate change and man made events on river plan forms novel analytical expressions are developed for the channel radius of curvature sinuosity wave length arc length initial arc angle meander path and a modified sine generated curve the theory expresses the channel radius of curvature in terms of channel depth flow froude number friction function and the difference between the valley slope and the channel regime slope channel sinuosity on the other hand is expressed in terms of a function of the channel width depth ratio a friction function and a friction coefficient such as darcy weisbach friction factor both equations describe correctly direction of change in meander geometry due to changes in the influential factors the equations for prediction of channel sinuosity and wave length proved successful when tested against existing field data and mathematical model results the developed theory showed that a decrease in the channel regime slope in relation to the valley slope leads to increase in channel curvature and meandering this condition is the primary cause for river curvature and meandering signaling the initiating mechanism for curvature or meandering the developed theory answers the question which was raised by da silva 2006 about why meanders occur even when there is no sediment transport the excess energy theory explained fluvial tidal meandering and channel straightening river processes one of the main conclusions of this study that it shows it is not sufficient to study and analyze river meandering using only geometrical data collected nowadays through satellite imagery such as meander geometry radius of curvature wave length migration rates etc and channel width the reason for such insufficiency is that these geometrical variables except for the width are effects of meandering rather than causes while width alone cannot be the sole influencing or causable or surrogate variable the excess energy theory has shown that the hydraulic variables such as flow discharge depth velocity slope valley and channel and sediment variables such as sediment load type and size of sediment load are very important influencing variables that cause curvature and meander formation and development therefore complete geometry and hydraulic data collection is necessary for a thorough

not clearly understood warmer climates will likely result in increased fire frequency and associated erosion frequent high intensity rainfall events and infrequent low intensity snowmelt elliot et al 2016a hydrologic models are commonly used to understand the impacts of forest disturbances and climate change on water quality borrelli 2021 elliot 2013 elliot et al 2016b sidman et al 2015 however forest watershed managers often lack the skills or the time to apply complex models elliot 2004 robichaud and ashmun 2013 the water erosion prediction project wepp model is a process based hydrology and erosion model used by many researchers and land managers to predict surface runoff and soil erosion from croplands rangelands and forests laflen et al 1997 the wepp model simulates surface hydrology and hydraulics subsurface hydrology vegetation growth residue accumulation and decay and sediment detachment and transport along each hillslope and channel segment using four major input files climate slope soil and vegetation wepp maintains a continuous daily water balance of surface runoff subsurface lateral flow soil evaporation plant transpiration residue evaporation total soil water deep percolation snow accumulation and melt and frozen soils the wepp model has been in use for several decades and there exists a plethora of publications describing the model development and applicability to a wide range of management conditions for both croplands and forests brooks et al 2016 covert et al 2005 dun et al 2009 elliot 2013 elliot et al 2015 flanagan and livingston 1995 flanagan and nearing 1995 laflen et al 1997 miller et al 2011 miller et al 2019 robichaud et al 2007 srivastava et al 2013 2017 2018 2020 wang et al 2010 zhang et al 2009 detailed descriptions of each of the erosion processes simulated by wepp are provided in flanagan and nearing 1995 lastly wepp can simulate individual hillslope profiles as well as small to large watersheds flanagan and livingston 1995 several interfaces have been developed for the wepp hillslope version to address specific forest and rangeland disturbances the most widely used wepp interfaces for forestry applications are those developed by the usda forest service fswepp elliot 2004 2013 elliot et al 2015 flanagan et al 2013 frankenberger et al 2011 robichaud et al 2007 managers currently apply these targeted interfaces to predict erosion and sediment delivery and make management decisions based on probability risk analysis specifically wepp road allows users to simulate roads and buffers ermit erosion risk management tool to simulate post wildfire erosion with and without erosion mitigation treatments in forest rangeland and chaparral landscapes disturbed wepp to simulate disturbances in forestlands and rangelands and wepp fume fuel management erosion analysis to simulate fuel management practices including thinning prescribed burns with or without road networks follow https forest moscowfsl wsu edu fswepp these interfaces are simplistic requiring users to specify hillslope topography and select the soil texture land cover and climate from an abbreviated list of options the soil and land cover databases for the fswepp interfaces are based on us field observations since their initial development these hillslope tools have completed more than 1 3 million runs across the us with additional runs from europe australia and anywhere else where users could describe the local climate concomitantly with these efforts was the development of several interfaces for the wepp model such as geowepp geo spatial interface for wepp qwepp qgis interface for wepp and wepp online gis geowepp is an arcgis dependent tool designed to automatically discretize a watershed into multiple hillslopes and channel segments and then assign a specific slope shape soil weather and landcover management file for each hillslope as well as for the entire watershed renschler 2003 flanagan et al 2013 qwepp was developed to run on the open source qgis platform instead of arcmap miller et al 2019 and is customized to use landscape soil and cover layers from the rapid response erosion database rred miller et al 2016 rred provides wepp formatted soil files in the wepp 1997 format version 97 3 merged with the ssurgo soil survey geographic database or statsgo2 state soil geographic database reybold and teselle 1989 soil data and the usgs land cover layer or post wildfire soil burn severity map qwepp can be applied to both burned and unburned conditions using wepp formatted soil and management files the wepp online gis tool was developed at the usda ars national soil erosion research laboratory nserl as an online gis application for running the wepp watershed model frankenberger et al 2011 the application uses openlayers for mapping and hypertext preprocessor php for file management https milford nserl purdue edu ol wepp index php this interface accesses google maps for spatial orientation the online nrcs ssurgo soils database reybold and teselle 1989 and 2011 usgs national land cover database nlcd maps homer et al 2015 to facilitate and automate wepp model setups and runs to predict runoff and erosion users only need a computer or tablet connected to the internet these tools were mainly developed for small agricultural field sized watersheds and are currently running with a wepp version that does not include baseflow an important component of the streamflow hydrographs in larger forested watersheds elliot et al 2016a web based applications are becoming increasingly common to support information commerce and services this has also been the case for watershed managers with the development of the ssurgo soils database and the usgs land cover and topographic databases providing spatial information for watershed modelers web based models and hydrologic modeling tools are now available for users that have limited modeling capabilities and recently several tools have emerged for acquiring and sharing data hydroshare cuahsi https www hydroshare org wikiwatersheds https wikiwatershed org streamstats https streamstats usgs gov ss that help land managers delineate watersheds and gather useful information from freely available databases watershed managers are now familiar with accessing spatial data online that are readily available web based tools have been developed that utilize machine to machine translation of data with limited human intervention eliminating many of the difficulties involved in applying standalone gis watershed tools these developments motivated us to build an enhanced online interface to the wepp watershed model to support forest watershed management in this paper we present a new online interface for the wepp model weppcloud and a framework wepppy that allows the incorporation and the development of several other hydrologic models and applications our goal was to make complex models more accessible to land managers to facilitate the decision making process weppcloud is complementary to the previously described wepp tools but it incorporates additional data sources e g gridded climate national databases such as prism parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model daly et al 2000 2008 daymet daily surface weather and climatological summaries thornton et al 2016 and gridmet gridded surface meteorological abatzoglou 2011 algorithms e g baseflow pollutant ash transport hourly seepage computations to improve lateral flow and computations of frost and ability to alter input files e g post disturbance ground cover channel properties and saturated hydraulic conductivity of the restricting layer which make the model more applicable to larger forested watersheds 300 10 000 ha and accessible to novice users wepp modeling can be complex however from our experience reasonable results can be obtained using default parameters dobre et al 2022b additionally weppcloud also provides enough flexibility to refine models with further parameterization weppcloud is open source and has a full open source modular software stack watershed delineation and processing of climates soils and land covers are done independently of weppcloud which can be coupled with other hydrologic models and decision support tools such as the rangeland hydrology and erosion model nearing et al 2011 the weppcloud modeling tool is presented in two parts part i weppcloud system description this paper and part ii weppcloud and wepp performance assessment and applications to forest managements and wildfires dobre et al 2022b part i of this manuscript presents the model platform description data inputs and outputs and modeled processes while part ii presents modeling results of streamflow sediment and phosphorus yield from 28 relatively undisturbed gauged forested watersheds in the states of california nevada oregon washington and idaho additionally part ii of this manuscript demonstrates the applicability of the weppcloud interface as a decision support tool to evaluate the effects of forest management and wildfires on water quality and quantity from ungauged watersheds 2 weppcloud development and structure 2 1 platform description weppcloud https wepp cloud is a web application implemented in the python programming language https python org that uses flask https flask palletsprojects com to provide a web interface and web api application programming interface for hydrologic models the weppcloud interface is powered by wepppy which is an open source bsd 3 license scientific python module for wepp modeling lew 2021 implemented specifically to support weppcloud unlike all other existing wepp interfaces geowepp wepp online gis and qwepp wepppy does not rely on topwepp a c application responsible for preparing input files for wepp from topaz topographic parameterization garbrecht and martz 1997 and mapping output files flanagan et al 2013 this functionality has been supplanted by wepppy which greatly enhances the flexibility and error handling of the platform a common problem with topwepp is segmentation faults when model inputs are not properly formatted the object oriented wepppy codebase improves code re use resulting in a codebase less than 1 10 that of the previous online interfaces with a reliance on procedural php scripts because of the modular architecture wepppy can be used for the online development of other hydrologic models that rely on freely available environmental data as shown by the inclusion of the rangeland hydrology and erosion model rhem nearing et al 2011 table 1 in the suite of weppcloud tools wepppy can also support batch processing of watersheds with simple python scripts the wepppy sub modules can be used independently of weppcloud to work with geospatial datasets prepare and run hydrologic models and aggregate and analyze model results the components of wepppy can be described as belonging to five functional categories as described below fig 1 2 1 1 weppcloud interface frontend the weppcloud interface is served by a python flask app and has views and controls defined using jinja templates html with templating the weppcloud frontend also includes javascript controllers for communicating with the flask app the web clients make use of bootstrap https getbootstrap com for formatting leaflet js https leafletjs com for maps jquery https jquery com for asynchronous communication and dynamic views and d3 js https d3js org for charts fig 1 a notable feature of the frontend is the ability to support both si international system of units and english units in the jinja templates the values are unitized by specifying the value and their units when the page is rendered in the browser the html contains the value in a variety of units e g kg lb and grams with all but one hidden from view users can change their unit preferences and the correct value and units are displayed 2 1 2 weppcloud interface backend weppcloud uses a postgresql database to manage user accounts and permissions with the assistance of flask security individual weppcloud projects however function independently from any centralized relational databases allowing them to be migrated by simply moving the files in fact all users can export their projects in their entirety to conduct further analyses or make modifications and rerun wepp on their own machines in the cloud projects are stored in a file directory structure and users can browse the files from a web based file explorer the independence is made possible by taking a nodb approach to the organization storage and manipulation of project parameters and data and is a key component to the flexibility provided by wepppy the wepppy nodb classes serialize project metadata in json javascript object notation the json files reside in the project folder and can be rapidly deserialized into python class instances in layman s terms this provides a pythonic interface for creating and manipulating weppcloud projects in the form of the wepppy nodb classes from a programmatic perspective a user can simply assign values to object attributes e g topaz mcl 5 and behind the scenes those assignments are made persistent by writing to the json serialized representations of the class objects this process is made robust by locking the json files to prevent more than one instance from making simultaneous changes in contrast the php based online interface for wepp relies on sessions for tracking model parameters these parameters must be manually passed from page to page and no longer exist after the session expires when users interact with the weppcloud web interface jquery sends asynchronous requests to a python flask service the flask service utilizes the wepppy nodb classes to acquire data transform data create inputs run models analyze model outputs and provide reports even for non programmatically inclined users this approach provides tremendous flexibility by clicking through a series of web based controls users can obtain a stack of rasters and other files with terrain topographic analyses soils landuse and climate without having to perform any actual programming 2 1 3 webservices weppcloud acquires many datasets on the fly as users build projects however some datasets are stored on weppcloud servers and made available via webservices a service called wmesque provides several raster layers like the 2016 usgs ned national elevation dataset as well as a ssurgo mukey mapunit key raster layer for geolocating soil parameters the service allows for easily obtaining georeferenced raster stacks for areas of interest the wmesque service is public facing allowing acquisition via other means like a reflective object oriented programming curl a web browser and r software weppcloud can access many climate datasets and utilizing these with a stochastic weather generator cligen climate generator nicks et al 1995 requires obtaining monthly normals for a set of locations a metquery webservice provides monthly climate normals daily maximum temperature daily minimum temperature precipitation for several meteorological datasets other webservices are implemented to allow the weppcloud frontend to query elevation data elevationquery as well as to transform coordinates from utm to wgs geo transformer lastly webservices are implemented to build wepp soil files using ssurgo statsgo2 datasets weppsoilbuilder and to build cligen climate files cligen 2 1 4 data clients and data handlers wepppy core modules as anyone who has worked with gis datasets can attest they can come in a variety of different formats with a plethora of different options with regards to data types georeferencing and units the wepppy core modules provide pythonic object oriented classes for reading writing and manipulating data the intent of these is to provide higher level abstractions for working with the data and encapsulating the intricacies of dealing with different data formats unit conversions and geo referencing they are implemented such that they can be used independently of the wepppy nodb classes 2 1 5 model command line interface adapters we refer to weppcloud as an online interface for wepp because it allows users to run the wepp model and other models like topaz topographic parameterization program taudem terrain analysis using digital elevation models cligen and rhem without having to install or type commands into a command prompt the command line interface cli wrappers use python s subprocess popen to run these command line applications the wrappers read the unix standard output stdout and error stderr data streams from the models to provide error tracing when the models crash the previous wepp interfaces do not have this ability which makes troubleshooting much more difficult 2 2 interfaces the weppcloud site is hosted on the research computing and data services servers at university of idaho https hpc uidaho edu weppcloud is available to users worldwide and supports locales in the us europe and australia users can create projects anonymously or create a weppcloud account and private projects users with accounts can be granted access to advanced poweruser features or to find and collaborate on model runs with other users by default runs can be easily shared via the unique url uniform resource locator or web address link that is assigned to each project perhaps the most important feature of weppcloud is its ability to automate the acquisition and processing of data for running wepp all the data processing for the wepp model is done within the weppcloud interface to allow users to create and store wepp model runs with our primary un disturbed interface users first select an area of interest or upload a soil burn severity sbs map which will automatically zoom in to the area of interest then a channel network is built and displayed on the map users can then select an outlet location and wepppy automates the delineation of hillslopes by running digital elevation models 10 or 30 m dems through the topaz or taudem tools to create a series of hillslopes and channels for the desired watershed based on the watershed outlet selected by the user further wepppy accesses online or uploaded landuse maps and online databases for soils and climates information from these databases is used to automatically create wepp specific input files by assigning respective soil management and climate files to each hillslope and channel segment the cligen model builds a daily stochastic climate from weather station statistics wepppy also identifies the land cover and soil layers and then builds the wepp management and soil files for each hillslope and channel segment users can then use the interfaces to run wepp to simulate streamflow peak runoff soil erosion and sediment and phosphorus delivery from hillslopes channels and watersheds for various management conditions undisturbed current conditions or disturbed for pre and post fire management operations to simulate post wildfire conditions users can upload a sbs map of four burn classes unburned low moderate and high severity these maps are created by the us forest service geospatial technology and applications center gtac and burned area emergency response baer imagery support initially gtac creates dnbr delta nbr maps from pre and post fire satellite nbr normalized burn ratio maps parsons et al 2010 miller et al 2016 which are further converted to barc256 burned area reflectance classification of 256 unique classes or barc4 4 classes maps the sbs maps are simply barc4 maps that have been field validated users can download barc256 or sbs maps from a central national database https burnseverity cr usgs gov baer baer imagery support data download with 256 class maps users specify break points to obtain four soil burn severity classes see fig 2 alternatively where sbs maps are not available users can download barc4 maps from the monitoring trends in burn severity https www mtbs gov website which hosts post wildfire maps for the continental us alaska hawaii and puerto rico from 1984 till present when using barc256 or barc4 maps users should be cautious as these reflect conditions of vegetation burn severity and not soil burn severity only the sbs maps are field validated and should be used for post fire erosion management several model interfaces exist on weppcloud table 1 these interfaces have been developed for specific geographic regions i e united states australia european union or site specific regions in the us i e lake tahoe basin california nevada seattle public utilities washington the interfaces utilize configuration files to specify what soil climate and landcover databases are used for specific locales table 1 the wepp model runs in the backend of all these interfaces except rhem based on the input data created by wepppy 2 3 other tools and utilities 2 3 1 debris flow the risk of debris flows occurring and the amount of sediment delivered from those debris flows is estimated by the cannon et al 2010 method based on burn severity soil properties topography and weather not shown the method is intended for general guidance only as the usgs currently carries out debris flow analyses for most large us wildfires using an advanced methodology staley et al 2016 2018 2 3 2 combined watershed viewer the combined watershed viewer allows users to visualize the runoff and erosion predictions across multiple watershed runs not shown the combined watershed viewer has a companion utility for creating hyperlinks to visualize a set of runs that can be easily shared 2 3 3 export projects arcmap the model runs use a file based project structure in conjunction with python model controllers serialized to json files the projects can be exported from the interface as zip archives or downloaded using wget weppcloud also has functionality for creating esri shapefiles containing sub catchments with model output attributes the shapefiles can be opened in gis to merge multiple runs develop gis storyboards or prepare maps for presentations reports or publications 2 3 4 ermit batch exportation the erosion risk management tool ermit provides probabilistic predictions of delivered sediment from hillslopes for each of the five years following a wildfire robichaud et al 2007 ermit has a batch processing tool that allows users to import hillslopes from weppcloud https forest moscowfsl wsu edu fswepp batch bermit html the ermit tool is particularly useful for evaluating the benefits of post wildfire applications of mulch or seeding or the installation of contour logs or straw wattles for erosion control results from the ermit batch processor can be merged with the exported shapefile in a gis should users want to present the ermit results spatially 2 3 5 wepppy win bootstrap wepppy win bootstrap lew 2021 is a lightweight open source python package available for advanced users that allows them to download previously run weppcloud projects and rerun them on windows computers without installing wepppy and its dependencies users can download multiple runs at the same time in batch mode make desired changes to the input files and then rerun the desired projects this is a useful and unique tool for experienced wepp users that allows them to further parameterize individual model runs with additional site specific data 3 modeled processes the most important hydrology and erosion processes for the weppcloud simulations are summarized in table 2 along with the data inputs and outputs associated with those processes a detailed description of these processes can be found in flanagan and nearing 1995 4 model input and simulations 4 1 basic processing options 4 1 1 watershed delineation the first step for running the weppcloud interface requires delineating a watershed into representative hillslopes and channels fig 3 and describing the structure that links hillslopes and channel segments to the overall stream network weppcloud uses either topaz or taudem to conduct topographic analysis with digital elevation models dems to identify the sub catchments and flowpaths within a watershed a wepppy routine then abstracts hillslope profiles from the outputs by tracing and aggregating flowpaths as described by cochrane 1999 topaz weppcloud uses topaz to abstract topographic data from digital elevation models dems for the continental us 30 or 10 m dems are available australia has a 30 m dem and europe has a 25 m dem topaz delineates a channel network from the dem based on the steepest downslope path from each raster cell pixel from the 8 cells surrounding it garbrecht and martz 1997 adjustments can be made to the detail of the channel network by changing values of the minimum source channel length mscl and the critical source area csa setting these to low values will increase the density of channels which is useful when defining small watersheds cao et al 2021 taudem additionally users can select the taudem terrain analysis using digital elevation models tarboton and baker 2008 wallis et al 2009 tool for the extraction and analysis of hydrologic information from topography as represented by a dem to use taudem for delineation go to https wepp cloud weppcloud create taudem is similar to topaz but more recent in its implementation taudem supports larger catchment areas and defines a binary channel network that eliminates more than three channels entering a single junction 4 1 2 landuse managements with the wepp model the most sensitive vegetation variables are the ground cover leaf area index lai and canopy cover as these all directly affect surface and subsurface hydrology and subsequently runoff and erosion miller et al 2011 nearing et al 1990 srivastava et al 2018 2020 the canopy and ground cover are specified in the wepp management file wepp can simulate daily vegetation conditions in detail including forest recovery following wildfire dun et al 2009 or timber harvest followed by prescribed fire srivastava et al 2020 both dun et al 2009 and srivastava et al 2020 simulated regenerating forest vegetation using observed weather however should a user want to estimate erosion from a disturbance using a stochastic climate as typical of the applications on weppcloud vegetation regeneration would quickly mask any effects of disturbance and the erosion associated with that disturbance would likely be underestimated in all but the first year if modeling with a stochastic climate miller et al 2011 noted that erosivity of the cligen stochastic climate in the first one to two years resulted in erosion rates less than the long term average further aggravating erosion underprediction if modeling with regenerating vegetation to better understand the likely erosion associated with a given disturbance the weppcloud interface assumes a fixed cover value for both canopy and ground cover for a wepp run of 20 100 years or more each simulation effectively represents another potential weather scenario that could occur following a disturbance this allows the model to provide both long term average output as well as output for any return period event that may occur with a given land cover or disturbance condition weppcloud is unique in that it supports several databases of management files each interface has crosswalk tables that specify which management file is used for each nlcd landuse class or equivalent for non us locales and soil burn severity class to assist the user in initiating a modeling run the interface first determines the dominant landuse for each hillslope based on the 2016 nlcd map or uploaded soil burn severity map the user can modify the canopy cover and ground cover value from the default values if desired this feature is particularly useful in the post fire environment where ground cover is highly variable robichaud et al 2007 or for fuel management operations where the disturbance from forest operations may not be the same as the default ground or canopy cover values provided by the interface the user can also select a different land cover from the database and adjust the cover to describe a unique condition some of the weppcloud interfaces allow the user to apply treatments to specific hillslopes for novel applications such as modeling vegetation regeneration the user can download the entire run to wepp windows and use a custom built management file alshantiri 2011 srivastava et al 2020 in the future weppcloud will allow users to provide or build their management files in a management editor 4 1 3 soils for the us two databases for soils are available in weppcloud ssurgo and statsgo2 reybold and teselle 1989 the ssurgo database is used as default and is queried during the watershed delineation process alternatively where the ssurgo database is not available the statsgo2 database is used to build the soil files a wepp soil file has two main categories with one line describing the rill and interrill erodibility and hydraulic conductivity and then several lines describing each layer in the soil profile flanagan and livingston 1995 the soil components sand clay very fine sand organic matter and cation exchange capacity were used to estimate the hydraulic conductivity and erodibility properties for the topmost soil layer flanagan and livingston 1995 when the lateral flow routines within wepp were modified by dun et al 2009 a second option was offered to allow users to specify the hydraulic conductivity bulk density anisotropy factor i e ratio of lateral to vertical saturated hydraulic conductivity within a soil horizon field capacity and wilting point of each of the profile layers and called it the 7778 soil file format the 7778 formatted files tend to result in better estimations of lateral flow boll et al 2015 weppcloud is novel in its ability to generate 7778 soils from the ssurgo statsgo2 databases whereas the other interfaces still use the original soil file format 4 1 4 climate the daily weather variables needed for the wepp model are daily precipitation depth prcp mm storm duration dur h ratio of time to peak intensity to total storm duration tp ratio of storm peak intensity to average intensity ip maximum tmax c and minimum tmin c daily air temperatures dew point temperature tdew c solar radiation rad langleys day wind velocity w vl m s and wind direction w dir degrees flanagan and livingston 1995 the weppcloud online interface offers users options for multiple climate data sources cligen prism daymet gridmet future or single storm cligen is a stochastic weather generator nicks et al 1995 flanagan et al 2001 srivastava et al 2019 that can be used to create weather input files formatted for wepp based on the observed weather statistics from 2765 stations across the us and 7673 international stations prism is a database that provides values for mean monthly precipitation and maximum and minimum temperatures on an 800 m grid for the lower 48 us states the values are interpolated from nearby weather stations and incorporate the effects of elevation and other topographic variables in estimating monthly values daymet and gridmet are gridded data sets based on interpolation of historic records available for the entire us at resolutions of 1 and 4 km respectively these datasets provide interpolated daily precipitation and maximum and minimum temperatures from multiple weather stations between 1980 and present the other weather variables needed by wepp are stochastically generated based on the nearest cligen weather station the cligen daymet and gridmet weather files can be altered based on the prism s monthly values of precipitation and maximum and minimum temperatures the future climate option uses coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 downscaled climate model daily series abatzoglou and brown 2012 to generate future climates between 2006 and 2099 for all climate options users can adjust the precipitation and minimum and maximum temperatures based on 1980 2018 values from the prism data set in addition to running in a continuous simulation mode using daily climate records weppcloud also provides an option to run a single storm mode weppcloud allows users to specify single storm climate files by defining a storm date total precipitation the duration of the storm and intensity users can use the single storm option to assess how a watershed will respond to a storm of a specified intensity and duration 4 1 5 representing changes in landuse or management the reasons for applying any erosion model are usually to evaluate erosion risk s for the current condition and then evaluate the impacts of alternative management practices on runoff erosion and sediment delivery the weppcloud interfaces were mainly developed to support forest watershed management however some of the interfaces can also be used for rangelands and croplands though additional management files may be needed for the relevant management practices generally forest erosion rates and sediment delivery are very low elliot 2013 and it is only when disturbances occur that erosion increases the four dominant forest disturbances are mechanical thinning or harvest prescribed fire wildfire and roads elliot 2013 the weppcloud interfaces do not include road erosion at this time however another fswepp interface wepp road allows for road analysis scenario testing and evaluation of treatment scenarios such as mulching after a wildfire thinning and even prescribed burns are vital components of land management land management not only alters vegetation but also soil properties e g soil erodibility therefore when modeling disturbances it is important to modify management and soil properties in tandem to properly represent disturbances and treatments elliot 2004 weppcloud un disturbed makes use of a parameter database with un disturbed classes and soil textures to parameterize wepp managements and soils based on field validated measures elliot 2004 modeling management alternatives with weppcloud usually starts with modeling undisturbed conditions followed by modifications to the land use to simulate disturbed conditions table 3 the un disturbed and wepp pep interfaces allow users to alter individual hillslopes the weppcloud interface provides functionality for cloning projects so current and treated conditions can be compared on a hillslope by hillslope basis these results can be exported and compared using desktop gis applications or other tools such as pi vat prioritization interactive visualization and analysis tool a shiny app companion tool for aggregating weppcloud results deval et al 2022 for wildfire mitigation with mulching users can change the high severity polygons by increasing the ground cover to the suggested value or a value in line with field observations from previous mulch applications for a more detailed analysis of management practices most of the weppcloud interfaces can export a file containing the information necessary to run every hillslope in a batch program for either the ermit model robichaud et al 2007 for post fire erosion mitigation analysis or disturbed wepp elliot 2004 for timber harvest or fuel management analyses advanced gis users will be able to combine the results of the ermit or disturbed wepp results in the arcmap or qgis programs that have downloaded the gis files from weppcloud the ermit model can evaluate the benefits of seeding log erosion barriers and mulching as well as predict the likelihood of sediment delivery from hillslopes for the five years following a wildfire disturbed wepp can allow fuel managers to incorporate undisturbed riparian buffers and more easily evaluate the effects of different amounts of ground cover associated with mechanical treatments or the timing of prescribed burns 4 2 advanced processing options extensive testing has demonstrated that weppcloud can consistently provide reasonable estimates within a magnitude order for areas with minimal site specific knowledge or hydrologic expertise from the users part ii dobre et al 2022b however several advanced options are available to allow users to further adjust default parameters to calibrate models or obtain additional information 4 2 1 flowpath processing weppcloud allows users to run simulations for each flowpath in the sub catchments similar to cochrane and flanagan 1999 flanagan et al 2013 available in the online gis wepp interface the outlet from one flowpath is assumed to exist for each pixel adjacent to a channel pixel if the subsequent flow path up the hill splits into more than a single pixel width the length of the flowpath is increased as the sum of the two combined lengths this option will produce gridded output results that can be used by managers to identify areas prone to erosion within individual hillslopes fig 4 for each flowpath the distribution of erosion or deposition along that flowpath is generated by wepp for at least 100 points from this distribution the erosion or deposition for each pixel is determined if more than one flowpath runs through a particular pixel the deposition loss estimates are aggregated by taking the average of the non zero values for that pixel a gis map of the erosion or deposition at each pixel is then generated fig 4b the number of flowpaths is 10 to 20 times the number of hillslope polygons so frequently flow path runs are only done for one or two years to determine the distribution of soil erosion on the landscape but not necessarily to get an accurate erosion estimate the watershed output for part of a watershed after the 2020 riverside fire in oregon indicates which hillslope polygons may be at risk of erosion fig 4a the darker areas in the flowpath result fig 4b may help users target mitigation treatment 4 2 2 hourly seepage computations the hourly seepage algorithms are based on the work of boll et al 2015 where it was demonstrated that drainage computed based on quasi steady state assumptions from particularly steep short hillslopes was not accurate and could lead to erroneous lateral flow and runoff predictions the use of these options also triggers modified drainage routines which assume unsaturated water flow is primarily vertical until the soil moisture of the soil layer exceeds field capacity moisture content the net result is that the hourly routines tend to simulate the initiation of lateral flow at the deeper depths above a restricting soil layer instead of lateral flow initiating in near surface soil layers under largely unsaturated conditions this algorithm will slightly increase runtimes and therefore it continues to be an option for users who are particularly interested in steep shallow soil landscapes 4 2 3 frost users are provided with the option for simulating the reduction in infiltration due to soil freezing based on the work of singh et al 2009 and dun et al 2010 soil freezing can greatly reduce infiltration rates particularly in wet compacted fine textured soils in some landscapes such as the loess soils in the dryland agricultural dominated region of the inland pacific northwest hillslope profiles are highly susceptible to runoff and erosion from thawing soils singh et al 2009 mccool and roe 2005 brooks et al 2012 with the thick insulating duff layers in forests low soil bulk density and porous soil structure soil freezing does not necessarily reduce infiltration dingman 1975 therefore we allow users to specifically determine whether or not they would like the model to simulate impacts of soil freezing 4 2 4 baseflow processing baseflow is estimated assuming a dynamic groundwater storage reservoir with a storage volume s mm where the input to the reservoir is from deep seepage from the soil profile estimated by the wepp model and daily flow from the reservoir into the stream channel as baseflow is a fraction of the total volume stored in the reservoir on the previous day brooks et al 2016 srivastava et al 2013 2020 in some geologies there is water loss from the systems as deep seepage which is estimated as a fraction lost from the reservoir each day that is not baseflow the default parameters for the baseflow calculations are the initial groundwater storage si mm baseflow coefficient kb day 1 deep seepage coefficient ks day 1 and the watershed groundwater baseflow threshold area ta ha the initial groundwater storage si is not a sensitive parameter in the model a default value of 200 mm can be used in most applications the linear coefficient kb can be best estimated from the slope of the ln t i m e vs ln f l o w hydrograph for the falling limb of the hydrograph during dry periods for gauged streams in the area the default parameter for the linear coefficient is 0 04 day 1 in cases where the groundwater aquifer leaks water to a deeper regional aquifer or laterally across the watershed boundary or below the stream gage users can optionally define a secondary aquifer loss defined by a second deep seepage linear coefficient ks in day 1 based on the same storage amount s if the upslope area above a point in the stream network is greater than the user defined critical watershed area baseflow is then simulated both at the watershed outlet and within the stream network the default critical area for baseflow is 1 0 ha this value can be greater in more arid watersheds 4 2 5 channel properties in wepp sediment detached from hillslopes will either be deposited downslope or will be routed to channels where it can be deposited or transported to the watershed s outlet additionally the model can estimate detachment and transport within the channel segments as well as the total sediment yield at the watershed s outlet the most sensitive parameters for channel erosion are channel soil erodibility and channel critical shear srivastava et al 2013 2020 found that the wepp model estimated reasonable results with a channel soil erodibility of 1 0 10 6 s m 1 we found similar results while modeling 28 forested watersheds in the pacific northwest dobre et al 2022b srivastava et al 2020 also demonstrated that there is a direct relationship between the channel critical shear and the d50 particle size from pebble count data to account for these findings the weppcloud interface was designed to allow users to enter the channel bed median particle size d50 which is used to estimate a critical bed shear stress value following berenbrock and tranmer 2008 4 2 6 saturated hydraulic conductivity of the restrictive layer most hydrologic models simulate runoff through infiltration excess runoff or hortonian overland flow however in areas where soils have high hydraulic conductivity or where shallow soils are overlaying geologically restrictive layers saturation excess runoff becomes an important runoff process the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the restrictive layer k sat is a critical parameter in wepp to accurately capture the subsurface lateral flow in mountainous regions dobre et al 2022b dun et al 2009 srivastava et al 2013 this value depends on the type of the underlying geology and can be specified by the user based on additional knowledge of the geology of the watershed 4 2 7 pollutant processing weppcloud uses a version of wepp with pollutant load modeling this is an optional selection that allows users to estimate pollutant losses based on known pollutant concentrations provided by the user dobre et al 2022a dobre et al 2022b elliot et al 2015 the estimates are simplistic and do not account for sorption desorption mineralization or immobilization they only provide rough estimates of the pollutant being transported by both water via surface runoff lateral flow and baseflow and adsorbed to sediments 4 3 model outputs the user is provided with the basic output from model simulations both at the hillslope and at the watershed scale the raw outputs from wepp plain text files are accessible via the online interface and the projects can be exported with all of the input and outputs included for further analyses or report preparation with a gis spreadsheet database or word processer on weppcloud model outputs such as water balance soil erosion sediment yield return period analysis are summarized for users both in tabular and graphical format for decision making these are similar to outputs from the wepp online gis interface frankenberger et al 2011 except for the water balance report see below which is unique to weppcloud 4 3 1 watershed loss summary the first table of this output page shows an average annual summary of precipitation amount hillslope and channel soil loss streamflow sediment and total phosphorus discharge fig 5 the second and third output tables on the same page are average annual summaries of the above mentioned variables for all hillslope and channel segments this report utilizes wepp s loss output but provides additional metrics as well as the ability to provide annual averages excluding the first couple of years when the simulation is stabilizing 4 3 2 return periods report the return period of an event of a given magnitude is the average recurrence interval between events equaling or exceeding a specified magnitude chow et al 1988 return periods reports provide daily precipitation runoff sediment yield and pollutant loads and rainfall intensities and peak runoff rates for recurrence intervals up to half the length of run for example a 20 year run will generate 2 5 and 10 year return period estimates the return period report is not provided by wepp but is provided by other wepp interfaces including the online gis wepp interface the values are estimated from the annual maxima series of wepp daily output values assuming a weibull distribution natural resource conservation service nrcs 2007 other recurrence intervals can also be specified by the user this report has an accompanying culvert diameter sizing spreadsheet tool that assumes orifice flow at the inlet is limiting and is intended to be used with the peak runoff rate estimates fig 6 shows that the return periods for one parameter do not necessarily occur from the same event as another for example the 5 year return period peak discharge for undisturbed conditions occurred on may 15th 1984 fig 6a whereas the 5 year return period for sediment yield occurred on january 4th1980 fig 6b 4 3 3 sediment characteristics report wepp internally routes sediment according to five class sizes clay particles silt particles small aggregates consisting of clay silt and organic matter sand particles and large aggregates consisting of clay silt sand particles and organic matter the sediment characteristics report provides mean diameter specific gravity and composition sand silt clay organic matter statistics for the sediments leaving the channel as well as the distribution of class sediment particles that are leaving the outlet not shown separate statistics are provided to describe the sediment classes leaving the hillslopes the sediment size distribution is used to improve estimates of particulate pollutant delivery and aid in evaluating the potential impacts of sand particles on aquatic health 4 3 4 water balance water year weppcloud has a water balance report that provides precipitation surface runoff lateral flow the sum of evaporation from the soil ground cover and transpiration of the vegetation et and percolation by hillslope averaged over the simulated water years weppcloud also has interactive plotting for daily runoff lateral flow and baseflow time series fig 7 4 3 5 spatial visualization weppcloud uses leaflet js to provide interactive maps for each model run a map interface displays the location of the outlet the channels and the subcatchments the interface can generate thematic maps to visualize landuse types soil types and topographic parameters slope aspect fig 8 once wepp has been run choropleth maps for surface runoff sediment yield and pollutant loads are available weppcloud also can combine maps of multiple watershed runs into a single map these maps can be downloaded in a gis format for further manipulation for analysis or inclusion in reports or presentations 5 implications for management and applications the weppcloud platform allows land managers to access a complex hydrologic and erosion model for land use decision making at the watershed scale the functionality of the interface and the various output options allow for comparing management scenarios the modeling is beneficial for post disturbance decision support for assessing risks to climate change and natural hazards like fire drought and high intensity storms for example undisturbed forest conditions can be compared to a forest thinning operation and its effect on stream discharge or sediment yield wildfire affected watersheds can be evaluated by uploading a soil burn severity map into the weppcloud platform and the effects of post fire mulching on runoff and erosion can readily be evaluated post fire results can be compared with an unburned condition with all other input conditions remaining the same to compare changes in runoff peak flow or sediment yield due to the wildfire and treatment currently weppcloud is used by the united states forest service usfs burned area emergency response baer teams department of interior doi emergency stabilization teams es teams state agencies e g california department of forestry and fire protection watershed emergency response team calfire wert to predict peak flows and the spatial distribution of erosion within watersheds and also to download hillslope specific information e g soil burn severity category slope length soil type vegetation etc which are further imported into the ermit batch tool to evaluate long term post fire treatments such as mulching weppcloud has also been applied to site specific locations to evaluate soil erosion from proposed future management scenarios or potential wildfires for example in the lake tahoe basin the model has been used to evaluate the risks from increasing mechanized thinning on slopes greater than 30 and the benefits of such treatments when compared to wildfire scenarios dobre et al 2022a water utilities from areas that have not experienced historic wildfires e g seattle public utilities portland water bureau are now using the model to better understand the potential increase in sediment yield from hypothetical fire scenarios the newest model development i e the ash transport model will also be applicable to water utilities and watershed managers interested in the contamination of their drinking water supply reservoirs with ash and nutrients weppcloud supports basic hydrology and erosion research by enabling researchers to establish base simulations that can be calibrated and manipulated to test various hydrological models or modeling approaches these findings are continuously integrated into wepppy weppcloud to improve model estimates weppcloud has primarily been used for forested areas but is also being used for croplands and rangelands weppcloud and its ability to quickly acquire and process site specific dem climate soils and landuse data are also useful for supporting models outside of weppcloud 6 future developments the weppcloud interface has considerable potential for further supporting forested watershed management recent studies supporting advanced watershed analyses as presented in the weppcloud site specific resources like lake tahoe in california included a simulated wildfire or soil burn severity for current conditions and treated conditions we intend to add a simulated wildfire option similar to the proof of concept burn severity simulator developed by the michigan technological research institute https apps mtri org burnsev get m miller personal communication in the absence of wildfire the road network is usually the greatest source of sediment in a forest watershed gis methodologies have been developed to link gis road layers to wepp to estimate sediment delivery from road networks elliot et al 2019 we intend to incorporate this advanced technology into weppcloud and link road erosion to overall watershed sediment delivery cao et al 2020 the interface also lends itself to supporting agricultural watershed analyses cropland applications will require a larger database of cropland management files to support the extremely diverse range of crops and tillage options that are common in the us we will explore the ability to link weppcloud with the usda nrcs conservation resource land management operations database cr lmod developed during the past five years to be used with wepp and weps wind erosion prediction system in nrcs field applications of these models cr lmod contains about 25 000 crop rotation templates across 75 crop management zones about 120 crops and 550 farming operations just as applications have been developed from western europe and australia there is also the goal of expanding the applications to asia south america and elsewhere in the western hemisphere if local collaborators can be found to assist in database development additional international collaboration can also be used to develop interfaces in other languages such as spanish or french other developments are planned for the near future weppcloud will incorporate multiple overland flow elements ofes to allow wepp to provide better deposition and soil loss modeling for long hillslopes additionally we intend to incorporate relationships between canopy cover lai and above ground live biomass similar to srivastava et al 2020 that will allow vegetation recovery following disturbance we also plan on utilizing gridmet s daily climate time series available up to yesterday for near real time prediction and erosion warning weppcloud could also serve as a platform to readily expand the daily erosion project https www dailyerosion org well beyond the midwest allowing estimation of erosion every day based on the previous day s nexrad next generation weather radar precipitation data such a feature would be particularly useful for providing near real time downstream estimates of post fire flooding we also plan on allowing users to select additional future climate models weppcloud is also slated to offer the ability for users to utilize their management files for increased customization of watershed models 7 summary and conclusions the weppcloud online suites of watershed interfaces are the latest development in online watershed modeling these powerful tools provide managers with the ability to comprehensively examine impacts of site specific management with a process based hydrologic model driven by the most accurate publicly available soil landuse and topographic maps gridded climate inputs representing topographic variation across complex watersheds for historic future and near real time weather data can be utilized weppcloud does not require expensive software that needs to be upgraded every year it runs and stores watershed simulations on a large server network avoiding issues with desktop memory and storage synthesizes outputs into maps tables and figures that are readily available for end users and can currently be used to simulate the hydrology anywhere across multiple continents in a manner of minutes the tools are intended to support forest and rangeland watershed management in evaluating the impacts of timber harvest fuel management and post wildfire watershed management in addition the rhem interface supports runoff and erosion analysis of rangeland hillslopes preliminary applications of the interface have been encouraging the large databases covering the continental us western europe and australia make the weppcloud interface readily usable in those regions future expansion to other erosion applications such as roads and croplands and other regions of the world are anticipated credit authorship contribution statement roger lew conceptualization methodology software writing

3508,we developed a new online interface for the water erosion prediction project wepp model weppcloud with a framework that allows the incorporation and development of several other models and applications to make hydrologic models more accessible to land managers and facilitate the decision making process all inputs to wepp such as topography soils land use and weather are automatically created from publicly available online international databases and converted into input formats readable by the model the weppcloud interface can be applied to forested cropland and rangeland conditions but it is specialized for undisturbed forest conditions post wildfire and pre and post wildfire management scenarios such as forest thinning prescribed fire or post wildfire mulching users only need a computer or device with a web browser and an internet connection to perform advanced hydrologic simulations all the model runs are stored remotely on weppcloud which can be accessed by the users at any given time this modeling tool is presented in two parts part i model description and parameterization and part ii model performance assessment and applications to forest management and wildfires keywords decision support tools water erosion prediction project weppcloud gauged ungauged watersheds soil erosion forest management post fire 1 introduction one of the critical ecosystem services provided by forests is clean water which from undisturbed forests is of high quality however forest disturbances such as wildfire timber harvest and fuel reduction often result in increased upland and channel erosion leading to a deterioration in water quality elliot 2013 climate change is also impacting forest hydrologic processes and the impacts of climate change on water quality are not clearly understood warmer climates will likely result in increased fire frequency and associated erosion frequent high intensity rainfall events and infrequent low intensity snowmelt elliot et al 2016a hydrologic models are commonly used to understand the impacts of forest disturbances and climate change on water quality borrelli 2021 elliot 2013 elliot et al 2016b sidman et al 2015 however forest watershed managers often lack the skills or the time to apply complex models elliot 2004 robichaud and ashmun 2013 the water erosion prediction project wepp model is a process based hydrology and erosion model used by many researchers and land managers to predict surface runoff and soil erosion from croplands rangelands and forests laflen et al 1997 the wepp model simulates surface hydrology and hydraulics subsurface hydrology vegetation growth residue accumulation and decay and sediment detachment and transport along each hillslope and channel segment using four major input files climate slope soil and vegetation wepp maintains a continuous daily water balance of surface runoff subsurface lateral flow soil evaporation plant transpiration residue evaporation total soil water deep percolation snow accumulation and melt and frozen soils the wepp model has been in use for several decades and there exists a plethora of publications describing the model development and applicability to a wide range of management conditions for both croplands and forests brooks et al 2016 covert et al 2005 dun et al 2009 elliot 2013 elliot et al 2015 flanagan and livingston 1995 flanagan and nearing 1995 laflen et al 1997 miller et al 2011 miller et al 2019 robichaud et al 2007 srivastava et al 2013 2017 2018 2020 wang et al 2010 zhang et al 2009 detailed descriptions of each of the erosion processes simulated by wepp are provided in flanagan and nearing 1995 lastly wepp can simulate individual hillslope profiles as well as small to large watersheds flanagan and livingston 1995 several interfaces have been developed for the wepp hillslope version to address specific forest and rangeland disturbances the most widely used wepp interfaces for forestry applications are those developed by the usda forest service fswepp elliot 2004 2013 elliot et al 2015 flanagan et al 2013 frankenberger et al 2011 robichaud et al 2007 managers currently apply these targeted interfaces to predict erosion and sediment delivery and make management decisions based on probability risk analysis specifically wepp road allows users to simulate roads and buffers ermit erosion risk management tool to simulate post wildfire erosion with and without erosion mitigation treatments in forest rangeland and chaparral landscapes disturbed wepp to simulate disturbances in forestlands and rangelands and wepp fume fuel management erosion analysis to simulate fuel management practices including thinning prescribed burns with or without road networks follow https forest moscowfsl wsu edu fswepp these interfaces are simplistic requiring users to specify hillslope topography and select the soil texture land cover and climate from an abbreviated list of options the soil and land cover databases for the fswepp interfaces are based on us field observations since their initial development these hillslope tools have completed more than 1 3 million runs across the us with additional runs from europe australia and anywhere else where users could describe the local climate concomitantly with these efforts was the development of several interfaces for the wepp model such as geowepp geo spatial interface for wepp qwepp qgis interface for wepp and wepp online gis geowepp is an arcgis dependent tool designed to automatically discretize a watershed into multiple hillslopes and channel segments and then assign a specific slope shape soil weather and landcover management file for each hillslope as well as for the entire watershed renschler 2003 flanagan et al 2013 qwepp was developed to run on the open source qgis platform instead of arcmap miller et al 2019 and is customized to use landscape soil and cover layers from the rapid response erosion database rred miller et al 2016 rred provides wepp formatted soil files in the wepp 1997 format version 97 3 merged with the ssurgo soil survey geographic database or statsgo2 state soil geographic database reybold and teselle 1989 soil data and the usgs land cover layer or post wildfire soil burn severity map qwepp can be applied to both burned and unburned conditions using wepp formatted soil and management files the wepp online gis tool was developed at the usda ars national soil erosion research laboratory nserl as an online gis application for running the wepp watershed model frankenberger et al 2011 the application uses openlayers for mapping and hypertext preprocessor php for file management https milford nserl purdue edu ol wepp index php this interface accesses google maps for spatial orientation the online nrcs ssurgo soils database reybold and teselle 1989 and 2011 usgs national land cover database nlcd maps homer et al 2015 to facilitate and automate wepp model setups and runs to predict runoff and erosion users only need a computer or tablet connected to the internet these tools were mainly developed for small agricultural field sized watersheds and are currently running with a wepp version that does not include baseflow an important component of the streamflow hydrographs in larger forested watersheds elliot et al 2016a web based applications are becoming increasingly common to support information commerce and services this has also been the case for watershed managers with the development of the ssurgo soils database and the usgs land cover and topographic databases providing spatial information for watershed modelers web based models and hydrologic modeling tools are now available for users that have limited modeling capabilities and recently several tools have emerged for acquiring and sharing data hydroshare cuahsi https www hydroshare org wikiwatersheds https wikiwatershed org streamstats https streamstats usgs gov ss that help land managers delineate watersheds and gather useful information from freely available databases watershed managers are now familiar with accessing spatial data online that are readily available web based tools have been developed that utilize machine to machine translation of data with limited human intervention eliminating many of the difficulties involved in applying standalone gis watershed tools these developments motivated us to build an enhanced online interface to the wepp watershed model to support forest watershed management in this paper we present a new online interface for the wepp model weppcloud and a framework wepppy that allows the incorporation and the development of several other hydrologic models and applications our goal was to make complex models more accessible to land managers to facilitate the decision making process weppcloud is complementary to the previously described wepp tools but it incorporates additional data sources e g gridded climate national databases such as prism parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model daly et al 2000 2008 daymet daily surface weather and climatological summaries thornton et al 2016 and gridmet gridded surface meteorological abatzoglou 2011 algorithms e g baseflow pollutant ash transport hourly seepage computations to improve lateral flow and computations of frost and ability to alter input files e g post disturbance ground cover channel properties and saturated hydraulic conductivity of the restricting layer which make the model more applicable to larger forested watersheds 300 10 000 ha and accessible to novice users wepp modeling can be complex however from our experience reasonable results can be obtained using default parameters dobre et al 2022b additionally weppcloud also provides enough flexibility to refine models with further parameterization weppcloud is open source and has a full open source modular software stack watershed delineation and processing of climates soils and land covers are done independently of weppcloud which can be coupled with other hydrologic models and decision support tools such as the rangeland hydrology and erosion model nearing et al 2011 the weppcloud modeling tool is presented in two parts part i weppcloud system description this paper and part ii weppcloud and wepp performance assessment and applications to forest managements and wildfires dobre et al 2022b part i of this manuscript presents the model platform description data inputs and outputs and modeled processes while part ii presents modeling results of streamflow sediment and phosphorus yield from 28 relatively undisturbed gauged forested watersheds in the states of california nevada oregon washington and idaho additionally part ii of this manuscript demonstrates the applicability of the weppcloud interface as a decision support tool to evaluate the effects of forest management and wildfires on water quality and quantity from ungauged watersheds 2 weppcloud development and structure 2 1 platform description weppcloud https wepp cloud is a web application implemented in the python programming language https python org that uses flask https flask palletsprojects com to provide a web interface and web api application programming interface for hydrologic models the weppcloud interface is powered by wepppy which is an open source bsd 3 license scientific python module for wepp modeling lew 2021 implemented specifically to support weppcloud unlike all other existing wepp interfaces geowepp wepp online gis and qwepp wepppy does not rely on topwepp a c application responsible for preparing input files for wepp from topaz topographic parameterization garbrecht and martz 1997 and mapping output files flanagan et al 2013 this functionality has been supplanted by wepppy which greatly enhances the flexibility and error handling of the platform a common problem with topwepp is segmentation faults when model inputs are not properly formatted the object oriented wepppy codebase improves code re use resulting in a codebase less than 1 10 that of the previous online interfaces with a reliance on procedural php scripts because of the modular architecture wepppy can be used for the online development of other hydrologic models that rely on freely available environmental data as shown by the inclusion of the rangeland hydrology and erosion model rhem nearing et al 2011 table 1 in the suite of weppcloud tools wepppy can also support batch processing of watersheds with simple python scripts the wepppy sub modules can be used independently of weppcloud to work with geospatial datasets prepare and run hydrologic models and aggregate and analyze model results the components of wepppy can be described as belonging to five functional categories as described below fig 1 2 1 1 weppcloud interface frontend the weppcloud interface is served by a python flask app and has views and controls defined using jinja templates html with templating the weppcloud frontend also includes javascript controllers for communicating with the flask app the web clients make use of bootstrap https getbootstrap com for formatting leaflet js https leafletjs com for maps jquery https jquery com for asynchronous communication and dynamic views and d3 js https d3js org for charts fig 1 a notable feature of the frontend is the ability to support both si international system of units and english units in the jinja templates the values are unitized by specifying the value and their units when the page is rendered in the browser the html contains the value in a variety of units e g kg lb and grams with all but one hidden from view users can change their unit preferences and the correct value and units are displayed 2 1 2 weppcloud interface backend weppcloud uses a postgresql database to manage user accounts and permissions with the assistance of flask security individual weppcloud projects however function independently from any centralized relational databases allowing them to be migrated by simply moving the files in fact all users can export their projects in their entirety to conduct further analyses or make modifications and rerun wepp on their own machines in the cloud projects are stored in a file directory structure and users can browse the files from a web based file explorer the independence is made possible by taking a nodb approach to the organization storage and manipulation of project parameters and data and is a key component to the flexibility provided by wepppy the wepppy nodb classes serialize project metadata in json javascript object notation the json files reside in the project folder and can be rapidly deserialized into python class instances in layman s terms this provides a pythonic interface for creating and manipulating weppcloud projects in the form of the wepppy nodb classes from a programmatic perspective a user can simply assign values to object attributes e g topaz mcl 5 and behind the scenes those assignments are made persistent by writing to the json serialized representations of the class objects this process is made robust by locking the json files to prevent more than one instance from making simultaneous changes in contrast the php based online interface for wepp relies on sessions for tracking model parameters these parameters must be manually passed from page to page and no longer exist after the session expires when users interact with the weppcloud web interface jquery sends asynchronous requests to a python flask service the flask service utilizes the wepppy nodb classes to acquire data transform data create inputs run models analyze model outputs and provide reports even for non programmatically inclined users this approach provides tremendous flexibility by clicking through a series of web based controls users can obtain a stack of rasters and other files with terrain topographic analyses soils landuse and climate without having to perform any actual programming 2 1 3 webservices weppcloud acquires many datasets on the fly as users build projects however some datasets are stored on weppcloud servers and made available via webservices a service called wmesque provides several raster layers like the 2016 usgs ned national elevation dataset as well as a ssurgo mukey mapunit key raster layer for geolocating soil parameters the service allows for easily obtaining georeferenced raster stacks for areas of interest the wmesque service is public facing allowing acquisition via other means like a reflective object oriented programming curl a web browser and r software weppcloud can access many climate datasets and utilizing these with a stochastic weather generator cligen climate generator nicks et al 1995 requires obtaining monthly normals for a set of locations a metquery webservice provides monthly climate normals daily maximum temperature daily minimum temperature precipitation for several meteorological datasets other webservices are implemented to allow the weppcloud frontend to query elevation data elevationquery as well as to transform coordinates from utm to wgs geo transformer lastly webservices are implemented to build wepp soil files using ssurgo statsgo2 datasets weppsoilbuilder and to build cligen climate files cligen 2 1 4 data clients and data handlers wepppy core modules as anyone who has worked with gis datasets can attest they can come in a variety of different formats with a plethora of different options with regards to data types georeferencing and units the wepppy core modules provide pythonic object oriented classes for reading writing and manipulating data the intent of these is to provide higher level abstractions for working with the data and encapsulating the intricacies of dealing with different data formats unit conversions and geo referencing they are implemented such that they can be used independently of the wepppy nodb classes 2 1 5 model command line interface adapters we refer to weppcloud as an online interface for wepp because it allows users to run the wepp model and other models like topaz topographic parameterization program taudem terrain analysis using digital elevation models cligen and rhem without having to install or type commands into a command prompt the command line interface cli wrappers use python s subprocess popen to run these command line applications the wrappers read the unix standard output stdout and error stderr data streams from the models to provide error tracing when the models crash the previous wepp interfaces do not have this ability which makes troubleshooting much more difficult 2 2 interfaces the weppcloud site is hosted on the research computing and data services servers at university of idaho https hpc uidaho edu weppcloud is available to users worldwide and supports locales in the us europe and australia users can create projects anonymously or create a weppcloud account and private projects users with accounts can be granted access to advanced poweruser features or to find and collaborate on model runs with other users by default runs can be easily shared via the unique url uniform resource locator or web address link that is assigned to each project perhaps the most important feature of weppcloud is its ability to automate the acquisition and processing of data for running wepp all the data processing for the wepp model is done within the weppcloud interface to allow users to create and store wepp model runs with our primary un disturbed interface users first select an area of interest or upload a soil burn severity sbs map which will automatically zoom in to the area of interest then a channel network is built and displayed on the map users can then select an outlet location and wepppy automates the delineation of hillslopes by running digital elevation models 10 or 30 m dems through the topaz or taudem tools to create a series of hillslopes and channels for the desired watershed based on the watershed outlet selected by the user further wepppy accesses online or uploaded landuse maps and online databases for soils and climates information from these databases is used to automatically create wepp specific input files by assigning respective soil management and climate files to each hillslope and channel segment the cligen model builds a daily stochastic climate from weather station statistics wepppy also identifies the land cover and soil layers and then builds the wepp management and soil files for each hillslope and channel segment users can then use the interfaces to run wepp to simulate streamflow peak runoff soil erosion and sediment and phosphorus delivery from hillslopes channels and watersheds for various management conditions undisturbed current conditions or disturbed for pre and post fire management operations to simulate post wildfire conditions users can upload a sbs map of four burn classes unburned low moderate and high severity these maps are created by the us forest service geospatial technology and applications center gtac and burned area emergency response baer imagery support initially gtac creates dnbr delta nbr maps from pre and post fire satellite nbr normalized burn ratio maps parsons et al 2010 miller et al 2016 which are further converted to barc256 burned area reflectance classification of 256 unique classes or barc4 4 classes maps the sbs maps are simply barc4 maps that have been field validated users can download barc256 or sbs maps from a central national database https burnseverity cr usgs gov baer baer imagery support data download with 256 class maps users specify break points to obtain four soil burn severity classes see fig 2 alternatively where sbs maps are not available users can download barc4 maps from the monitoring trends in burn severity https www mtbs gov website which hosts post wildfire maps for the continental us alaska hawaii and puerto rico from 1984 till present when using barc256 or barc4 maps users should be cautious as these reflect conditions of vegetation burn severity and not soil burn severity only the sbs maps are field validated and should be used for post fire erosion management several model interfaces exist on weppcloud table 1 these interfaces have been developed for specific geographic regions i e united states australia european union or site specific regions in the us i e lake tahoe basin california nevada seattle public utilities washington the interfaces utilize configuration files to specify what soil climate and landcover databases are used for specific locales table 1 the wepp model runs in the backend of all these interfaces except rhem based on the input data created by wepppy 2 3 other tools and utilities 2 3 1 debris flow the risk of debris flows occurring and the amount of sediment delivered from those debris flows is estimated by the cannon et al 2010 method based on burn severity soil properties topography and weather not shown the method is intended for general guidance only as the usgs currently carries out debris flow analyses for most large us wildfires using an advanced methodology staley et al 2016 2018 2 3 2 combined watershed viewer the combined watershed viewer allows users to visualize the runoff and erosion predictions across multiple watershed runs not shown the combined watershed viewer has a companion utility for creating hyperlinks to visualize a set of runs that can be easily shared 2 3 3 export projects arcmap the model runs use a file based project structure in conjunction with python model controllers serialized to json files the projects can be exported from the interface as zip archives or downloaded using wget weppcloud also has functionality for creating esri shapefiles containing sub catchments with model output attributes the shapefiles can be opened in gis to merge multiple runs develop gis storyboards or prepare maps for presentations reports or publications 2 3 4 ermit batch exportation the erosion risk management tool ermit provides probabilistic predictions of delivered sediment from hillslopes for each of the five years following a wildfire robichaud et al 2007 ermit has a batch processing tool that allows users to import hillslopes from weppcloud https forest moscowfsl wsu edu fswepp batch bermit html the ermit tool is particularly useful for evaluating the benefits of post wildfire applications of mulch or seeding or the installation of contour logs or straw wattles for erosion control results from the ermit batch processor can be merged with the exported shapefile in a gis should users want to present the ermit results spatially 2 3 5 wepppy win bootstrap wepppy win bootstrap lew 2021 is a lightweight open source python package available for advanced users that allows them to download previously run weppcloud projects and rerun them on windows computers without installing wepppy and its dependencies users can download multiple runs at the same time in batch mode make desired changes to the input files and then rerun the desired projects this is a useful and unique tool for experienced wepp users that allows them to further parameterize individual model runs with additional site specific data 3 modeled processes the most important hydrology and erosion processes for the weppcloud simulations are summarized in table 2 along with the data inputs and outputs associated with those processes a detailed description of these processes can be found in flanagan and nearing 1995 4 model input and simulations 4 1 basic processing options 4 1 1 watershed delineation the first step for running the weppcloud interface requires delineating a watershed into representative hillslopes and channels fig 3 and describing the structure that links hillslopes and channel segments to the overall stream network weppcloud uses either topaz or taudem to conduct topographic analysis with digital elevation models dems to identify the sub catchments and flowpaths within a watershed a wepppy routine then abstracts hillslope profiles from the outputs by tracing and aggregating flowpaths as described by cochrane 1999 topaz weppcloud uses topaz to abstract topographic data from digital elevation models dems for the continental us 30 or 10 m dems are available australia has a 30 m dem and europe has a 25 m dem topaz delineates a channel network from the dem based on the steepest downslope path from each raster cell pixel from the 8 cells surrounding it garbrecht and martz 1997 adjustments can be made to the detail of the channel network by changing values of the minimum source channel length mscl and the critical source area csa setting these to low values will increase the density of channels which is useful when defining small watersheds cao et al 2021 taudem additionally users can select the taudem terrain analysis using digital elevation models tarboton and baker 2008 wallis et al 2009 tool for the extraction and analysis of hydrologic information from topography as represented by a dem to use taudem for delineation go to https wepp cloud weppcloud create taudem is similar to topaz but more recent in its implementation taudem supports larger catchment areas and defines a binary channel network that eliminates more than three channels entering a single junction 4 1 2 landuse managements with the wepp model the most sensitive vegetation variables are the ground cover leaf area index lai and canopy cover as these all directly affect surface and subsurface hydrology and subsequently runoff and erosion miller et al 2011 nearing et al 1990 srivastava et al 2018 2020 the canopy and ground cover are specified in the wepp management file wepp can simulate daily vegetation conditions in detail including forest recovery following wildfire dun et al 2009 or timber harvest followed by prescribed fire srivastava et al 2020 both dun et al 2009 and srivastava et al 2020 simulated regenerating forest vegetation using observed weather however should a user want to estimate erosion from a disturbance using a stochastic climate as typical of the applications on weppcloud vegetation regeneration would quickly mask any effects of disturbance and the erosion associated with that disturbance would likely be underestimated in all but the first year if modeling with a stochastic climate miller et al 2011 noted that erosivity of the cligen stochastic climate in the first one to two years resulted in erosion rates less than the long term average further aggravating erosion underprediction if modeling with regenerating vegetation to better understand the likely erosion associated with a given disturbance the weppcloud interface assumes a fixed cover value for both canopy and ground cover for a wepp run of 20 100 years or more each simulation effectively represents another potential weather scenario that could occur following a disturbance this allows the model to provide both long term average output as well as output for any return period event that may occur with a given land cover or disturbance condition weppcloud is unique in that it supports several databases of management files each interface has crosswalk tables that specify which management file is used for each nlcd landuse class or equivalent for non us locales and soil burn severity class to assist the user in initiating a modeling run the interface first determines the dominant landuse for each hillslope based on the 2016 nlcd map or uploaded soil burn severity map the user can modify the canopy cover and ground cover value from the default values if desired this feature is particularly useful in the post fire environment where ground cover is highly variable robichaud et al 2007 or for fuel management operations where the disturbance from forest operations may not be the same as the default ground or canopy cover values provided by the interface the user can also select a different land cover from the database and adjust the cover to describe a unique condition some of the weppcloud interfaces allow the user to apply treatments to specific hillslopes for novel applications such as modeling vegetation regeneration the user can download the entire run to wepp windows and use a custom built management file alshantiri 2011 srivastava et al 2020 in the future weppcloud will allow users to provide or build their management files in a management editor 4 1 3 soils for the us two databases for soils are available in weppcloud ssurgo and statsgo2 reybold and teselle 1989 the ssurgo database is used as default and is queried during the watershed delineation process alternatively where the ssurgo database is not available the statsgo2 database is used to build the soil files a wepp soil file has two main categories with one line describing the rill and interrill erodibility and hydraulic conductivity and then several lines describing each layer in the soil profile flanagan and livingston 1995 the soil components sand clay very fine sand organic matter and cation exchange capacity were used to estimate the hydraulic conductivity and erodibility properties for the topmost soil layer flanagan and livingston 1995 when the lateral flow routines within wepp were modified by dun et al 2009 a second option was offered to allow users to specify the hydraulic conductivity bulk density anisotropy factor i e ratio of lateral to vertical saturated hydraulic conductivity within a soil horizon field capacity and wilting point of each of the profile layers and called it the 7778 soil file format the 7778 formatted files tend to result in better estimations of lateral flow boll et al 2015 weppcloud is novel in its ability to generate 7778 soils from the ssurgo statsgo2 databases whereas the other interfaces still use the original soil file format 4 1 4 climate the daily weather variables needed for the wepp model are daily precipitation depth prcp mm storm duration dur h ratio of time to peak intensity to total storm duration tp ratio of storm peak intensity to average intensity ip maximum tmax c and minimum tmin c daily air temperatures dew point temperature tdew c solar radiation rad langleys day wind velocity w vl m s and wind direction w dir degrees flanagan and livingston 1995 the weppcloud online interface offers users options for multiple climate data sources cligen prism daymet gridmet future or single storm cligen is a stochastic weather generator nicks et al 1995 flanagan et al 2001 srivastava et al 2019 that can be used to create weather input files formatted for wepp based on the observed weather statistics from 2765 stations across the us and 7673 international stations prism is a database that provides values for mean monthly precipitation and maximum and minimum temperatures on an 800 m grid for the lower 48 us states the values are interpolated from nearby weather stations and incorporate the effects of elevation and other topographic variables in estimating monthly values daymet and gridmet are gridded data sets based on interpolation of historic records available for the entire us at resolutions of 1 and 4 km respectively these datasets provide interpolated daily precipitation and maximum and minimum temperatures from multiple weather stations between 1980 and present the other weather variables needed by wepp are stochastically generated based on the nearest cligen weather station the cligen daymet and gridmet weather files can be altered based on the prism s monthly values of precipitation and maximum and minimum temperatures the future climate option uses coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 downscaled climate model daily series abatzoglou and brown 2012 to generate future climates between 2006 and 2099 for all climate options users can adjust the precipitation and minimum and maximum temperatures based on 1980 2018 values from the prism data set in addition to running in a continuous simulation mode using daily climate records weppcloud also provides an option to run a single storm mode weppcloud allows users to specify single storm climate files by defining a storm date total precipitation the duration of the storm and intensity users can use the single storm option to assess how a watershed will respond to a storm of a specified intensity and duration 4 1 5 representing changes in landuse or management the reasons for applying any erosion model are usually to evaluate erosion risk s for the current condition and then evaluate the impacts of alternative management practices on runoff erosion and sediment delivery the weppcloud interfaces were mainly developed to support forest watershed management however some of the interfaces can also be used for rangelands and croplands though additional management files may be needed for the relevant management practices generally forest erosion rates and sediment delivery are very low elliot 2013 and it is only when disturbances occur that erosion increases the four dominant forest disturbances are mechanical thinning or harvest prescribed fire wildfire and roads elliot 2013 the weppcloud interfaces do not include road erosion at this time however another fswepp interface wepp road allows for road analysis scenario testing and evaluation of treatment scenarios such as mulching after a wildfire thinning and even prescribed burns are vital components of land management land management not only alters vegetation but also soil properties e g soil erodibility therefore when modeling disturbances it is important to modify management and soil properties in tandem to properly represent disturbances and treatments elliot 2004 weppcloud un disturbed makes use of a parameter database with un disturbed classes and soil textures to parameterize wepp managements and soils based on field validated measures elliot 2004 modeling management alternatives with weppcloud usually starts with modeling undisturbed conditions followed by modifications to the land use to simulate disturbed conditions table 3 the un disturbed and wepp pep interfaces allow users to alter individual hillslopes the weppcloud interface provides functionality for cloning projects so current and treated conditions can be compared on a hillslope by hillslope basis these results can be exported and compared using desktop gis applications or other tools such as pi vat prioritization interactive visualization and analysis tool a shiny app companion tool for aggregating weppcloud results deval et al 2022 for wildfire mitigation with mulching users can change the high severity polygons by increasing the ground cover to the suggested value or a value in line with field observations from previous mulch applications for a more detailed analysis of management practices most of the weppcloud interfaces can export a file containing the information necessary to run every hillslope in a batch program for either the ermit model robichaud et al 2007 for post fire erosion mitigation analysis or disturbed wepp elliot 2004 for timber harvest or fuel management analyses advanced gis users will be able to combine the results of the ermit or disturbed wepp results in the arcmap or qgis programs that have downloaded the gis files from weppcloud the ermit model can evaluate the benefits of seeding log erosion barriers and mulching as well as predict the likelihood of sediment delivery from hillslopes for the five years following a wildfire disturbed wepp can allow fuel managers to incorporate undisturbed riparian buffers and more easily evaluate the effects of different amounts of ground cover associated with mechanical treatments or the timing of prescribed burns 4 2 advanced processing options extensive testing has demonstrated that weppcloud can consistently provide reasonable estimates within a magnitude order for areas with minimal site specific knowledge or hydrologic expertise from the users part ii dobre et al 2022b however several advanced options are available to allow users to further adjust default parameters to calibrate models or obtain additional information 4 2 1 flowpath processing weppcloud allows users to run simulations for each flowpath in the sub catchments similar to cochrane and flanagan 1999 flanagan et al 2013 available in the online gis wepp interface the outlet from one flowpath is assumed to exist for each pixel adjacent to a channel pixel if the subsequent flow path up the hill splits into more than a single pixel width the length of the flowpath is increased as the sum of the two combined lengths this option will produce gridded output results that can be used by managers to identify areas prone to erosion within individual hillslopes fig 4 for each flowpath the distribution of erosion or deposition along that flowpath is generated by wepp for at least 100 points from this distribution the erosion or deposition for each pixel is determined if more than one flowpath runs through a particular pixel the deposition loss estimates are aggregated by taking the average of the non zero values for that pixel a gis map of the erosion or deposition at each pixel is then generated fig 4b the number of flowpaths is 10 to 20 times the number of hillslope polygons so frequently flow path runs are only done for one or two years to determine the distribution of soil erosion on the landscape but not necessarily to get an accurate erosion estimate the watershed output for part of a watershed after the 2020 riverside fire in oregon indicates which hillslope polygons may be at risk of erosion fig 4a the darker areas in the flowpath result fig 4b may help users target mitigation treatment 4 2 2 hourly seepage computations the hourly seepage algorithms are based on the work of boll et al 2015 where it was demonstrated that drainage computed based on quasi steady state assumptions from particularly steep short hillslopes was not accurate and could lead to erroneous lateral flow and runoff predictions the use of these options also triggers modified drainage routines which assume unsaturated water flow is primarily vertical until the soil moisture of the soil layer exceeds field capacity moisture content the net result is that the hourly routines tend to simulate the initiation of lateral flow at the deeper depths above a restricting soil layer instead of lateral flow initiating in near surface soil layers under largely unsaturated conditions this algorithm will slightly increase runtimes and therefore it continues to be an option for users who are particularly interested in steep shallow soil landscapes 4 2 3 frost users are provided with the option for simulating the reduction in infiltration due to soil freezing based on the work of singh et al 2009 and dun et al 2010 soil freezing can greatly reduce infiltration rates particularly in wet compacted fine textured soils in some landscapes such as the loess soils in the dryland agricultural dominated region of the inland pacific northwest hillslope profiles are highly susceptible to runoff and erosion from thawing soils singh et al 2009 mccool and roe 2005 brooks et al 2012 with the thick insulating duff layers in forests low soil bulk density and porous soil structure soil freezing does not necessarily reduce infiltration dingman 1975 therefore we allow users to specifically determine whether or not they would like the model to simulate impacts of soil freezing 4 2 4 baseflow processing baseflow is estimated assuming a dynamic groundwater storage reservoir with a storage volume s mm where the input to the reservoir is from deep seepage from the soil profile estimated by the wepp model and daily flow from the reservoir into the stream channel as baseflow is a fraction of the total volume stored in the reservoir on the previous day brooks et al 2016 srivastava et al 2013 2020 in some geologies there is water loss from the systems as deep seepage which is estimated as a fraction lost from the reservoir each day that is not baseflow the default parameters for the baseflow calculations are the initial groundwater storage si mm baseflow coefficient kb day 1 deep seepage coefficient ks day 1 and the watershed groundwater baseflow threshold area ta ha the initial groundwater storage si is not a sensitive parameter in the model a default value of 200 mm can be used in most applications the linear coefficient kb can be best estimated from the slope of the ln t i m e vs ln f l o w hydrograph for the falling limb of the hydrograph during dry periods for gauged streams in the area the default parameter for the linear coefficient is 0 04 day 1 in cases where the groundwater aquifer leaks water to a deeper regional aquifer or laterally across the watershed boundary or below the stream gage users can optionally define a secondary aquifer loss defined by a second deep seepage linear coefficient ks in day 1 based on the same storage amount s if the upslope area above a point in the stream network is greater than the user defined critical watershed area baseflow is then simulated both at the watershed outlet and within the stream network the default critical area for baseflow is 1 0 ha this value can be greater in more arid watersheds 4 2 5 channel properties in wepp sediment detached from hillslopes will either be deposited downslope or will be routed to channels where it can be deposited or transported to the watershed s outlet additionally the model can estimate detachment and transport within the channel segments as well as the total sediment yield at the watershed s outlet the most sensitive parameters for channel erosion are channel soil erodibility and channel critical shear srivastava et al 2013 2020 found that the wepp model estimated reasonable results with a channel soil erodibility of 1 0 10 6 s m 1 we found similar results while modeling 28 forested watersheds in the pacific northwest dobre et al 2022b srivastava et al 2020 also demonstrated that there is a direct relationship between the channel critical shear and the d50 particle size from pebble count data to account for these findings the weppcloud interface was designed to allow users to enter the channel bed median particle size d50 which is used to estimate a critical bed shear stress value following berenbrock and tranmer 2008 4 2 6 saturated hydraulic conductivity of the restrictive layer most hydrologic models simulate runoff through infiltration excess runoff or hortonian overland flow however in areas where soils have high hydraulic conductivity or where shallow soils are overlaying geologically restrictive layers saturation excess runoff becomes an important runoff process the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the restrictive layer k sat is a critical parameter in wepp to accurately capture the subsurface lateral flow in mountainous regions dobre et al 2022b dun et al 2009 srivastava et al 2013 this value depends on the type of the underlying geology and can be specified by the user based on additional knowledge of the geology of the watershed 4 2 7 pollutant processing weppcloud uses a version of wepp with pollutant load modeling this is an optional selection that allows users to estimate pollutant losses based on known pollutant concentrations provided by the user dobre et al 2022a dobre et al 2022b elliot et al 2015 the estimates are simplistic and do not account for sorption desorption mineralization or immobilization they only provide rough estimates of the pollutant being transported by both water via surface runoff lateral flow and baseflow and adsorbed to sediments 4 3 model outputs the user is provided with the basic output from model simulations both at the hillslope and at the watershed scale the raw outputs from wepp plain text files are accessible via the online interface and the projects can be exported with all of the input and outputs included for further analyses or report preparation with a gis spreadsheet database or word processer on weppcloud model outputs such as water balance soil erosion sediment yield return period analysis are summarized for users both in tabular and graphical format for decision making these are similar to outputs from the wepp online gis interface frankenberger et al 2011 except for the water balance report see below which is unique to weppcloud 4 3 1 watershed loss summary the first table of this output page shows an average annual summary of precipitation amount hillslope and channel soil loss streamflow sediment and total phosphorus discharge fig 5 the second and third output tables on the same page are average annual summaries of the above mentioned variables for all hillslope and channel segments this report utilizes wepp s loss output but provides additional metrics as well as the ability to provide annual averages excluding the first couple of years when the simulation is stabilizing 4 3 2 return periods report the return period of an event of a given magnitude is the average recurrence interval between events equaling or exceeding a specified magnitude chow et al 1988 return periods reports provide daily precipitation runoff sediment yield and pollutant loads and rainfall intensities and peak runoff rates for recurrence intervals up to half the length of run for example a 20 year run will generate 2 5 and 10 year return period estimates the return period report is not provided by wepp but is provided by other wepp interfaces including the online gis wepp interface the values are estimated from the annual maxima series of wepp daily output values assuming a weibull distribution natural resource conservation service nrcs 2007 other recurrence intervals can also be specified by the user this report has an accompanying culvert diameter sizing spreadsheet tool that assumes orifice flow at the inlet is limiting and is intended to be used with the peak runoff rate estimates fig 6 shows that the return periods for one parameter do not necessarily occur from the same event as another for example the 5 year return period peak discharge for undisturbed conditions occurred on may 15th 1984 fig 6a whereas the 5 year return period for sediment yield occurred on january 4th1980 fig 6b 4 3 3 sediment characteristics report wepp internally routes sediment according to five class sizes clay particles silt particles small aggregates consisting of clay silt and organic matter sand particles and large aggregates consisting of clay silt sand particles and organic matter the sediment characteristics report provides mean diameter specific gravity and composition sand silt clay organic matter statistics for the sediments leaving the channel as well as the distribution of class sediment particles that are leaving the outlet not shown separate statistics are provided to describe the sediment classes leaving the hillslopes the sediment size distribution is used to improve estimates of particulate pollutant delivery and aid in evaluating the potential impacts of sand particles on aquatic health 4 3 4 water balance water year weppcloud has a water balance report that provides precipitation surface runoff lateral flow the sum of evaporation from the soil ground cover and transpiration of the vegetation et and percolation by hillslope averaged over the simulated water years weppcloud also has interactive plotting for daily runoff lateral flow and baseflow time series fig 7 4 3 5 spatial visualization weppcloud uses leaflet js to provide interactive maps for each model run a map interface displays the location of the outlet the channels and the subcatchments the interface can generate thematic maps to visualize landuse types soil types and topographic parameters slope aspect fig 8 once wepp has been run choropleth maps for surface runoff sediment yield and pollutant loads are available weppcloud also can combine maps of multiple watershed runs into a single map these maps can be downloaded in a gis format for further manipulation for analysis or inclusion in reports or presentations 5 implications for management and applications the weppcloud platform allows land managers to access a complex hydrologic and erosion model for land use decision making at the watershed scale the functionality of the interface and the various output options allow for comparing management scenarios the modeling is beneficial for post disturbance decision support for assessing risks to climate change and natural hazards like fire drought and high intensity storms for example undisturbed forest conditions can be compared to a forest thinning operation and its effect on stream discharge or sediment yield wildfire affected watersheds can be evaluated by uploading a soil burn severity map into the weppcloud platform and the effects of post fire mulching on runoff and erosion can readily be evaluated post fire results can be compared with an unburned condition with all other input conditions remaining the same to compare changes in runoff peak flow or sediment yield due to the wildfire and treatment currently weppcloud is used by the united states forest service usfs burned area emergency response baer teams department of interior doi emergency stabilization teams es teams state agencies e g california department of forestry and fire protection watershed emergency response team calfire wert to predict peak flows and the spatial distribution of erosion within watersheds and also to download hillslope specific information e g soil burn severity category slope length soil type vegetation etc which are further imported into the ermit batch tool to evaluate long term post fire treatments such as mulching weppcloud has also been applied to site specific locations to evaluate soil erosion from proposed future management scenarios or potential wildfires for example in the lake tahoe basin the model has been used to evaluate the risks from increasing mechanized thinning on slopes greater than 30 and the benefits of such treatments when compared to wildfire scenarios dobre et al 2022a water utilities from areas that have not experienced historic wildfires e g seattle public utilities portland water bureau are now using the model to better understand the potential increase in sediment yield from hypothetical fire scenarios the newest model development i e the ash transport model will also be applicable to water utilities and watershed managers interested in the contamination of their drinking water supply reservoirs with ash and nutrients weppcloud supports basic hydrology and erosion research by enabling researchers to establish base simulations that can be calibrated and manipulated to test various hydrological models or modeling approaches these findings are continuously integrated into wepppy weppcloud to improve model estimates weppcloud has primarily been used for forested areas but is also being used for croplands and rangelands weppcloud and its ability to quickly acquire and process site specific dem climate soils and landuse data are also useful for supporting models outside of weppcloud 6 future developments the weppcloud interface has considerable potential for further supporting forested watershed management recent studies supporting advanced watershed analyses as presented in the weppcloud site specific resources like lake tahoe in california included a simulated wildfire or soil burn severity for current conditions and treated conditions we intend to add a simulated wildfire option similar to the proof of concept burn severity simulator developed by the michigan technological research institute https apps mtri org burnsev get m miller personal communication in the absence of wildfire the road network is usually the greatest source of sediment in a forest watershed gis methodologies have been developed to link gis road layers to wepp to estimate sediment delivery from road networks elliot et al 2019 we intend to incorporate this advanced technology into weppcloud and link road erosion to overall watershed sediment delivery cao et al 2020 the interface also lends itself to supporting agricultural watershed analyses cropland applications will require a larger database of cropland management files to support the extremely diverse range of crops and tillage options that are common in the us we will explore the ability to link weppcloud with the usda nrcs conservation resource land management operations database cr lmod developed during the past five years to be used with wepp and weps wind erosion prediction system in nrcs field applications of these models cr lmod contains about 25 000 crop rotation templates across 75 crop management zones about 120 crops and 550 farming operations just as applications have been developed from western europe and australia there is also the goal of expanding the applications to asia south america and elsewhere in the western hemisphere if local collaborators can be found to assist in database development additional international collaboration can also be used to develop interfaces in other languages such as spanish or french other developments are planned for the near future weppcloud will incorporate multiple overland flow elements ofes to allow wepp to provide better deposition and soil loss modeling for long hillslopes additionally we intend to incorporate relationships between canopy cover lai and above ground live biomass similar to srivastava et al 2020 that will allow vegetation recovery following disturbance we also plan on utilizing gridmet s daily climate time series available up to yesterday for near real time prediction and erosion warning weppcloud could also serve as a platform to readily expand the daily erosion project https www dailyerosion org well beyond the midwest allowing estimation of erosion every day based on the previous day s nexrad next generation weather radar precipitation data such a feature would be particularly useful for providing near real time downstream estimates of post fire flooding we also plan on allowing users to select additional future climate models weppcloud is also slated to offer the ability for users to utilize their management files for increased customization of watershed models 7 summary and conclusions the weppcloud online suites of watershed interfaces are the latest development in online watershed modeling these powerful tools provide managers with the ability to comprehensively examine impacts of site specific management with a process based hydrologic model driven by the most accurate publicly available soil landuse and topographic maps gridded climate inputs representing topographic variation across complex watersheds for historic future and near real time weather data can be utilized weppcloud does not require expensive software that needs to be upgraded every year it runs and stores watershed simulations on a large server network avoiding issues with desktop memory and storage synthesizes outputs into maps tables and figures that are readily available for end users and can currently be used to simulate the hydrology anywhere across multiple continents in a manner of minutes the tools are intended to support forest and rangeland watershed management in evaluating the impacts of timber harvest fuel management and post wildfire watershed management in addition the rhem interface supports runoff and erosion analysis of rangeland hillslopes preliminary applications of the interface have been encouraging the large databases covering the continental us western europe and australia make the weppcloud interface readily usable in those regions future expansion to other erosion applications such as roads and croplands and other regions of the world are anticipated credit authorship contribution statement roger lew conceptualization methodology software writing

3509,iron manganese binary oxides fe mn oxides have the potential to immobilize arsenite arsenate as iii v in situ in natural environments however the as iii v immobilization performances of fe mn oxides in the presence of indigenous metal reducing bacteria in reducing groundwater systems have received limited attention here as iii v immobilization by fe mn oxides and the interactions of fe and mn oxide components in groundwater in the presence of a newly isolated indigenous metal reducing bacterium bacillus sp fmr were investigated microcosm experiments were performed with artificial groundwater and mineral phases fe mn and fe mn oxides with as iii or as v in the presence or absence of strain fmr under anoxic conditions the fe oxides in anaerobic cultures without bacteria exhibited better immobilization performances for as iii 69 as t removal efficiency and as v 70 than mn oxides 19 and 17 respectively comparably the involvement of bacteria induced the re release of arsenic adsorbed on the single fe and mn oxides under anoxic conditions whereas this shift in arsenic adsorption desorption was not observed in fe mn oxide systems because the mn oxide components inhibited the reductive dissolution of the fe oxide components the as t removal efficiencies of fe mn oxides in the presence of bacteria increased by 17 for as iii and 16 for as v compared with anaerobic incubation without bacteria the interaction of fe and mn oxides in fe mn oxides resulted in a slightly increased mobilization of as iii v in the absence of bacteria whereas there was a synergistic effect in the presence of bacteria the favorability of indigenous bacteria for as iii v immobilization and the synergy between fe and mn oxides provide novel insights for in situ as iii v immobilization in high arsenic containing groundwater keywords arsenic immobilization indigenous bacteria fe mn binary oxides biostimulation high arsenic groundwater 1 introduction arsenic as a prevalent pollutant in soil and groundwater dia et al 2015 liao et al 2021 mccann et al 2018 threatens human health because of its high toxicity and potential carcinogenicity guo et al 2008 hou et al 2017 xie et al 2018 in groundwater as primarily occurs in two inorganic forms arsenate and arsenite which are negatively charged or neutral in normal ph ranges bai et al 2016 arsenite as iii is more toxic soluble and mobile than arsenate as v he et al 2019 zhang et al 2007b thus the oxidation process of as iii plays a very critical role in the natural remediation of as in groundwater he et al 2019 villalobos et al 2014 however as v produced by oxidation is still hazardous therefore oxidation coupled with subsequent adsorption represents a potential strategy for the in situ immobilization of as in groundwater he et al 2019 the adsorption of as by iron fe and manganese mn oxides is a vital pathway in restricting as migration in contaminated environments ehlert et al 2014 parikh et al 2010 in natural aquatic ecosystems fe oxides are mainly produced through the chemical oxidation of soluble fe ii borch et al 2010 whereas mn oxides are formed through the bio oxidation of mn ii learman et al 2011 tebo et al 2005 tran et al 2018 yu and leadbetter 2020 however soluble mn ii and fe ii commonly coexist in the groundwater environment and fe oxides bind with mn oxides to form fe mn oxides in situ through coprecipitation mccann et al 2018 accordingly fe mn oxides play vital roles in as immobilization in groundwater recently studies have focused on immobilizing as from contaminated soil and groundwater through natural and synthetic fe mn oxides under oxygenated conditions demonstrating that fe mn oxides possess excellent oxidation capacities and high adsorption abilities corresponding to those of single mn oxides and fe oxides respectively learman et al 2011 siddiqui et al 2019 zheng et al 2020 which simultaneously causes the oxidation of as iii and the effective adsorption of the formed as v moreover fe mn oxides do a better job of immobilizing as than single phases mccann et al 2018 which is unpredictable because mn oxides have very poor adsorption performances for as zhang et al 2014 therefore it is necessary to investigate simultaneously the contribution of each component of the fe mn oxides and the interaction between them to assess their removal of as the as cycle is closely related to microbial activities in the groundwater environment guo et al 2013 metal reducing and metal oxidizing bacteria play crucial roles in the oxidation and adsorption of as through mn or fe oxides he et al 2019 liao et al 2013 the biogenic fe mn oxides produced by mn oxidizing bacteria have the potential for the oxidation and adsorption of as owing to their high oxidizing power and specific surface area bai et al 2016 chang et al 2018 wang et al 2020 furthermore the bioaugmentation of mn oxidizing bacteria effectively decreases the pollutants of groundwater thereby improving its quality and producing drinking water bai et al 2016 however reducing bacteria causes the reduction and release of as from groundwater minerals including iron oxy hydroxides and mn oxides benner et al 2002 dia et al 2015 tufano and fendorf 2008 the bio reduction of as bearing fe mn oxides decreases the surface area of minerals and along with changes in as species causes the release of adsorbed arsenic on the minerals into the aqueous phase under anaerobic conditions tufano and fendorf 2008 however the reductive transformation of fe oxides initially decreases as elution owing to as incorporation during mineral restructuring coker et al 2006 continued anaerobic reduction eventually results in both the dissolution of fe oxides and the release of as tufano and fendorf 2008 however single fe oxides or mn oxides have mainly been studied with limited attention being paid to the fe mn oxides under anoxic conditions in this study we investigated the immobilization of as iii v in high as containing groundwater by fe mn oxides in the presence of indigenous metal reducing bacteria under anoxic conditions the objectives of this paper were as follows 1 to highlight the respective contributions and interactions of fe and mn oxide components in as immobilization in the groundwater system 2 to explore the mechanism of the reduction and release of fe and mn from fe mn oxides in the presence of indigenous bacteria and 3 to determine the effects of the reductive transformation of fe mn oxides caused by indigenous bacteria on the immobilization of as

xie et al 2013 the detailed isolation and purification steps for strain fmr are described in the supplementary information text s1 strain fmr s abilities to reduce fe iii ferric citrate 28 mg l 1 mn iv mno2 28 mg l 1 and as v na2haso4 7h2o 1 mg l 1 were measured under anaerobic conditions furthermore the effects of as iii as naaso2 0 1 5 10 and 30 mg l 1 and as v as naaso4 12h2o 0 1 5 10 and 30 mg l 1 on the growth of strain fmr were determined by measuring the optical density of the cultures at 600 nm od600 nm using an ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer the experiments were performed in triplicate all the manipulations were conducted in an anoxic glovebox containing 5 co2 10 h2 and 85 n2 to provide an anaerobic environment the strain was inoculated into a slightly modified minimal salts medium mmsm cai et al 2020 this medium contained the following components mg l nacl 1 000 nh4cl 250 kh2po4 20 kcl 500 cacl2 10 mgcl2 6h2o 60 sodium acetate 800 yeast extract 200 n 2 hydroxylpiperazine n 2 ethanesulfonic acid hepes 2 383 at ph 7 20 the removal effectiveness of as iii naaso2 1 mg l 1 or as v naaso4 12h2o 1 mg l 1 through single and binary fe and mn oxides was determined using a series of batch experiments the mmsm approximately 200 ml amended with as iii v was distributed into 250 ml serum bottles under a high nitrogen atmosphere after autoclaving for 20 min at 121 c the log phase bacterial cultures were washed with 0 8 nacl three times and then inoculated 2 into the mmsm the bacterial cell number was determined by counting the colony forming units on the luria bertani lb solid culture medium using dilution plating rathod et al 2019a ye et al 2020 for batch experiments 200 mg l 1 of fe mn or fe mn oxides were added in batches to the mmsm in sealed serum bottles in which strain fmr had reached an initial cell density of 106 cells ml in an anoxic glove box control groups without bacterial inoculum were run to compare for evidence of any abiotic changes each experimental condition was used in triplicate sampling was performed at regular intervals in the anoxic glove box between samplings the bottles were cultured in the dark in a shaking incubator 30 c and 150 rpm outside the glove box ehlert et al 2014 2 4 aqueous sample analysis concentrations of fe total t fe ii mn ii as total t and different as species as iii and as v remaining in the medium were monitored for the aqueous samples each was filtered through 0 22 μm membrane as iii and as v were separated in accordance with le et al 2000 and the concentrations of different as species were analyzed using hydride generation atomic fluorescence spectroscopy afs 9700 beijing haiguang instrument co ltd china the soluble fe ii and fe t concentrations were measured by ferrozine spectrophotometry at 562 nm in accordance with viollier et al 2000 the fe iii concentration was calculated using the difference between the concentrations of fe t and fe ii whereas fe iii was precipitated at ph 2 in the absence of a ligand he et al 2018 the dissolved mn ii level was determined by formaldehyde oxime spectrophotometry he et al 2019 removal kinetics of as iii v via fe mn oxides were fitted via pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models in the absence of bacteria xu et al 2020 2 5 statistical analysis the results are presented as means standard deviations of at least three independent replicates data were analyzed using an analysis of variance spss 17 0 usa with statistically significant differences set at p less than 0 05 3 results 3 1 isolation and identification of indigenous metal reducing bacteria the colonies of strain fmr were both white and round on lb solid culture medium fig s1 table s1 the sem images fig s2 showed that the cell morphology was a straight long rod shape with a width of 0 8 1 0 μm and a length of 3 0 4 5 μm the physiological and biochemical properties of strain fmr table s2 were consistent with the general description of bacillus species cai et al 2016 xie et al 2013 furthermore the 16s rrna gene sequences of strain fmr were analyzed using basic local alignment search tool blast the results revealed that strain fmr was highly homologous with bacillus cereus strain 19 w 99 the phylogenetic analysis also showed that strain fmr clustered together with these bacillus species fig s3 indicating strain fmr was a member of the bacillus family these corroborating identification indicators allowed the final identification of strain fmr as bacillus sp fmr the strain bacillus sp fmr genbank 16s rrna accession number ol598581 was preserved at the state key laboratory of biogeology and environmental geology china university of geosciences wuhan china the capacity of strain fmr for reducing fe iii fig s4a and mn iv fig s4b in the mmsm were investigated strain fmr reduced 76 of fe iii to fe ii in a ferric citrate solution 28 mg l 1 dissolved fe iii throughout the experiment 0 11 days moreover the mn bio reduction efficiency in an mno2 suspension solution 28 mg l 1 insoluble mn iv reached 81 in control groups without bacterial cells fe ii was not appreciably detected in the solution and mn ii reached as low as approximately 1 83 mg l 1 the soluble mn ii released in the control groups was likely due to the reductive dissolution with the ligand assisted dissolution of mn iv mno2 because sodium acetate was present in the culture medium biver and shotyk 2012 carrasco et al 2008 kiczka et al 2010 zhang et al 2007b the growth of strain fmr under different as v or as iii concentrations is shown in fig s5 we observed that bacterial growth slowed down as the as iii v concentration increased from 1 to 30 mg l 1 suggesting that increasing as iii v concentration inhibited the strain s growth kinetics however strain fmr demonstrated tolerable growth at up to 30 mg l 1 as v fig s5a and 30 mg l as iii fig s5b furthermore strain fmr had similar growth kinetics during the 1 mg l 1 as v and 1 mg l 1 as iii indicating that the effects of as species on the growth of strain fmr was negligible at 1 mg l 1 as v iii 3 2 characterization of initial minerals the specific surface areas of mn fe and fe mn oxides were 78 8 212 1 and 265 1 m2 g 1 respectively the xrd analysis of fe mn oxides and their components revealed that both fe and mn oxides in the fe mn oxides mainly exist in their non crystalline form fig s6 the xrd patterns of the initial fe oxides exhibited two broad peaks 35 and 63 of 2 θ which were indexed to the amorphous 2 line ferrihydrite the mn oxides near 37 and 66 of 2 θ were interpreted as amorphous δ mno2 the sem analysis revealed that the surfaces of fe oxides fig s7a and fe mn oxides fig s7c were very rough and contained porous structures indicating that fe oxides and fe mn oxides have the potential to provide abundant active sites for as adsorption the energy dispersion spectrum showed that the molar ratio of fe mn in fe mn oxides was about 3 0 which was similar to the value about 3 3 detected after digestion 3 3 as v removal compared with the control groups without bacteria strain fmr liberated fe ii into solution from fe oxides during as v immobilization fig 1 a however the release of fe ii from fe mn oxides in the presence of fmr began to increase slowly after approximately 4 days until the maximum concentration of only 0 93 mg l 1 was reached on day 11 fig 1a the variation trend of fe t liberated from fe mn oxides and single fe oxides were similar to those of corresponding fe ii during the experiment fig 1a and b and dissolved fe iii was not detected in any filtration solution mn ii was obviously released from fe mn oxides and single mn oxides in the presence of strain fmr reaching maximum concentrations of 38 33 and 16 97 mg l 1 respectively fig 1c during the experiment the fe ii and mn ii were not appreciably released from fe mn and fe mn oxides in the absence of strain fmr the buffers used in the medium in all the reaction systems ensured that the ph changed remained relatively stable changing from an initial ph of 7 20 to a final ph of 7 04 7 13 fig s9b the medium containing only strain fmr and as v revealed that fmr alone did not result in the reduction and adsorption of as v fig s8a during as v immobilization by fe oxides without strain fmr the aqueous as v concentration decreased rapidly from 1 000 to 364 00 μg l 1 within 2 days and then stabilized after 4 days the final as t removal efficiency was 70 fig 2 b the removal of as v by fe oxides with strain fmr in the first 4 days fig 2a was similar to that of the system without bacteria in the solution however aqueous as v began to desorb after 4 days and then the as t removal efficiency decreased to 54 unlike fe oxides mn oxides exhibited very low adsorption performances for as v in the absence 17 as removal efficiency and presence 8 of strain fmr fig 2c and d for fe mn oxides the as v concentration decreased from 1 000 to 281 61 μg l 1 in the absence of bacteria fig 2f and from 1000 to 163 66 μg l 1 in the presence of strain fmr fig 2e resulting in as t removal efficiencies of 72 and 84 respectively as iii was not detected in any of the as v immobilization reaction systems during the 11 day incubation period fig 2a f furthermore the kinetic model for as v immobilization with fe mn oxides in the absence of bacteria table s3 showed that both pseudo first order r2 0 954 and pseudo second order kinetic models r2 0 987 well described the as v adsorption kinetic 3 4 as iii removal the change trends of soluble fe ii and mn ii in the as iii immobilization system fig 3 a c were similar to those of the corresponding as v system fig 1a c fe ii was significantly released from fe oxides with strain fmr whereas the bio reduction of fe iii from fe mn oxides was not observed fig 3a during the entire test period the ph of the as iii systems did not change significantly fig s10b the incubation containing only strain fmr and as iii revealed that the oxidation and adsorption capacities of strain fmr for as iii were not significant fig s8b the trend of fe oxides to remove as iii fig 4 a and b was similar to that of as v fig 2a and b during as iii immobilization by fe oxides without bacteria the aqueous as iii concentration decreased rapidly and then stabilized after 4 days resulting in an as t removal efficiency of 69 corresponding to the as t concentration decreasing from 1 000 to 310 99 μg l 1 fig 4b however as iii was desorbed after 3 days and then the as t removal efficiency decreased to 53 in the fe oxide system with strain fmr as v was not detected in any of the as iii immobilization systems with fe oxides implying that fe oxides had no as iii oxidation capacities unlike fe oxides mn oxides exhibited low adsorption capacities but high oxidation activities for as iii and the as t removal efficiencies were 19 and 9 in the absence and presence of strain fmr respectively fig 4c and d the fe mn oxides integrated the chemical properties of both fe and mn oxides and thus they could not only rapidly oxidize but also effectively adsorb as species fig 4 moreover the as t adsorption capacities of fe mn oxides mediated by strain fmr were higher than that without bacteria with as t removal efficiencies of 86 and 74 respectively fig 4e and f furthermore the kinetic model for as iii immobilization with fe mn oxides in the absence of bacteria table s4 showed that both pseudo first order r2 0 950 and pseudo second order kinetic models r2 0 986 well described the as iii adsorption kinetic 3 5 surface analysis of fe mn oxides the x ray diffraction xrd analysis of fe mn oxides indicated that no significant mineral phase transition occurred in amorphous fe mn oxides after reaction with as iii v or after incubation with strain fmr fig s11 a sem analysis was conducted using mineral particles after incubation with bacteria under anaerobic conditions to verify the morphology of bacteria and fe mn oxides as well as the effective contacts between strain fmr and fe mn oxides rathod et al 2019a fe mn oxides maintained their original granular particles without significant changes in morphology after incubation without fmr fig 5 a and s7c whereas bio reduced fe mn oxides showed some morphological changes fig 5b these sem observations of incubated minerals demonstrated that the direct contact between the bacterial cells and the mineral surface induced mineral agglomeration through biological activities rathod et al 2019b and the resulting fe mn oxides were a complex of embedded fe mn oxide microparticles and bacterial cells fig 5b furthermore the bet specific surface areas of fe mn oxides increased from 265 0 m2 g 1 initially to 286 1 m2 g 1 after incubation with fmr the xps analysis was performed to determine the surface compositions on fe mn oxides the binding energy of the fe 2p spectrum on the initial fe mn oxides surface was 711 0 electron volt ev which was attributed to fe iii hou et al 2020 indicating that fe iii was the predominant fe species fig 6 a the binding energies of the fe 2p spectra on the fe mn oxides surfaces did not change significantly after reaction with as iii v or bio reduction the mn 2p spectrum 642 6 ev on the initial fe mn oxides surface suggested that mn iv was the predominant mn species fig 6b the mn 2p spectra showed that no obvious change occurred for the binding energies of mn 2p spectra on the surfaces of fe mn oxides without strain fmr after reacting with as iii v fig 6b nevertheless the binding energies of mn 2p spectra with strain fmr decreased from 642 6 to 642 1 and 642 0 ev relative to that of the initial fe mn oxides after reacting with as v and as iii respectively fig 6b indicating that bacteria induced an increase in the proportion of reduced mn mn ii mn iii compared with tetravalent mn commonly the binding energies of as 3d at 44 2 44 5 and 45 2 45 6 ev in as oxides are attributed to as iii and as v respectively zheng et al 2020 the as 3d spectra indicated that as v was the predominant as species adsorbed by fe mn oxides with fig 7 b or without fig 7a strain fmr after reacting with as v the as 3d spectrum of fe mn oxides in the as iii immobilization system fig 8 b was similar to that in the as v immobilization system fig 7a in the absence of fmr suggesting that the dominant as species adsorbed on fe mn oxides without strain fmr in as iii immobilization was as v with a binding energy of 45 4 ev this further confirmed that as iii was oxidized effectively to as v through fe mn oxides in the absence of strain fmr nevertheless the as 3d spectrum of fe mn oxides with strain fmr in as iii immobilization showed two peaks fig 8a which were attributed to as iii 44 4 ev and as v 45 5 ev 4 discussion in this study the indigenous bacterium bacillus sp fmr isolated from as rich aquifer sediment exhibited high resistance to as iii v fig s5 and demonstrated a high reducing capacity for dissolved fe iii and insoluble mn iv fig s4 similar metal reducing bacteria such as bacillus sp ht 1 kocar et al 2006 and bacillus subterraneus sp nov kanso et al 2002 have also been isolated and reported in previous studies the present results demonstrated that strain fmr induced the release of fe ii and mn ii from the single fe and mn oxides into solution during the immobilization of as iii v for fe mn oxides mn ii was significantly released into the solution in the presence of strain fmr whereas fe ii was only slightly released at the later stage of the experiment implying that mn oxides inhibited the formation and release of fe ii in fe mn oxides with strain fmr there are three possible reasons for this reaction first the bio reduction of fe iii and mn iv followed thermodynamic properties in which the reduction of mn iv took precedence over fe iii borch et al 2010 second microbially generated fe ii was rapidly re oxidized to ferrihydrite by the mn oxide component ehlert et al 2014 this reason is supported by the abiotic fe ii oxidation which demonstrated that fe ii feso4 7h2o 0 02 g l 1 was almost completely oxidized by mn oxides 0 2 g l 1 within 10 min under anoxic conditions fig s12 similar results were also observed by ehlert et al 2014 during an abiotic oxidation experiment in which about 95 of fe ii was almost instantly oxidized by birnessite furthermore the xrd analysis revealed that the diffraction patterns of fe mn oxides were identical before and after bio reduction fig s11 indicating that the fe oxide phase was still ferrihydrite in fe mn oxides after bio reduction these normal xrd analyses are insufficient to identify new mineral phases owing to bacterial weathering rathod et al 2019a techniques such as synchrotron nano diffraction have high potential to characterize the localized surface modification of minerals owing to bacterial weathering rathod et al 2019b the xps analysis revealed that the main fe species on the fe mn oxides surface was still fe iii after biological reduction fig 6a which also supported this reason third the metal reduction capacities of the bacteria were weakened owing to the decrease in bacterial biomass and activity level in the later stage of the experiment despite mn oxides being consumed zhang et al 2018 this was supported by the decreased bacterial cell density in the later stage of incubation figs s9a and s10a thus the inhibition of the mn oxide component on the formation and release of fe ii induced by bacteria in fe mn oxides might result from a combination of the thermodynamic priority for the reduction of mn iv the reoxidation of fe ii by mn oxides and the attenuation of bacterial activity during the later incubation stages fe mn oxides are widely present in shallow groundwater environments and their fe and mn oxide components play different roles in as immobilization amirbahman et al 2006 hou et al 2017 in this study the fe oxide components of fe mn oxides mainly acted as adsorbents for as immobilization whereas the mn oxide components only acted as oxidants figs 2 and 4 similar results have been reported in which the fe oxide components of fe mn oxides were mainly responsible for as adsorption bai et al 2016 mn oxides can effectively adsorb a variety of metal cations such as zn cd and pb bai et al 2016 zhou et al 2015 however single mn oxides showed a low adsorption capacity for as in this study figs 2 and 4 which may be due to as being an oxygen anion song et al 2021 as iii exists mainly as uncharged h3aso3 0 at a neutral ph whereas as v exists primarily in anionic forms as haso4 2 and h2aso4 bai et al 2016 the roles of the fe and mn oxide components of fe mn oxides in as iii v immobilization in the presence of strain fmr were similar to those of the corresponding controls without bacteria figs 2 and 4 however bacteria induced the adsorption desorption shift during the reaction of single fe mn oxides with as which was mainly attributed to the bio reduction of single fe mn oxides cai et al 2020 in addition in some cases there is an interaction between fe and mn oxide components during the adsorption of as by fe mn oxides zheng et al 2020 the interaction of the two elements generally includes antagonism synergy or additive effect zhao et al 2020 in this study the as t removal efficiency of fe mn oxides increased slightly to 72 and 74 in as v fig 2b d and f and as iii fig 4b d and f immobilization systems respectively without fmr relative to the single phases implying that additive effect between fe and mn oxide components was observed with a slight increase in as v as iii immobilization in the absence of strain fmr remarkably in the presence of strain fmr the as t removal efficiencies of the fe mn oxides were clearly greater than those of the single fe and mn oxides in the as v fig 2a c and e and as iii fig 4a c and e immobilization systems indicating that the synergy between fe and mn oxide components was present in as immobilization in the presence of strain fmr this result is mainly attributed to the bio reduction of single fe mn oxides weakening the immobilization of as whereas the bacteria do not decrease the as immobilization of fe mn oxides owing to the mn oxide component inhibiting the reductive dissolution of the fe oxide component the results indicated that strain fmr had negligible effects on the redox and adsorption of as iii v fig s6a b this result is similar to that of bai et al 2016 in which the oxidation and adsorption of as species were attributed to biogenic fe mn minerals formed in situ in aerobic cultures rather than to pseudomonas sp qjx 1 conversely other studies have reported that certain bacteria can effectively bioaccumulate as iii v in solution ayangbenro and babalola 2017 rathod et al 2019b the inconsistent conclusions on the bioaccumulation abilities of bacteria for as can be attributed to differences in as concentrations bacterial biomasses and bacterial as binding capacities rathod et al 2019a the present results showed that both the free fig 2e and f and adsorbed as species fig 7a and b were as v in as v immobilization by fe mn oxides with or without strain fmr therefore the immobilization mechanism of fe mn oxides on as v is mainly adsorption removal for as iii immobilization fe mn oxides were found to be able to not only oxidize as iii effectively but also adsorb it fig 4 this result is further supported by the xps analysis fig 8b in which as iii adsorbed on the surface of fe mn oxides was completely oxidized to as v by the mn oxide component without strain fmr both as iii and as v species were adsorbed on the surfaces of fe mn oxides in as iii immobilization with strain fmr given that as iii was not completely oxidized fig 8a the abiotic oxidation activity of the mn oxide component to adsorbed as iii was reduced in the presence of bacteria and this decrease was attributable to i bio reduction of the mn oxide component in the fe mn oxides fig 6b and ii passivation of the mn oxide component by cell coating and mineral agglomeration fig 5 hence the immobilization mechanism of fe mn oxides on as iii is an approach of oxidation coupled with adsorption as follows first aqueous as iii is adsorbed onto the surface of fe mn oxides second adsorbed as iii is oxidized to as v by the mn oxide component on the surface third the as v generated by oxidation is released from the surface of fe mn oxides into the solution ultimately the generated as v is re adsorbed onto other sites on the surfaces of fe mn oxides the kinetic model fitting results showed that as iii v immobilization by fe mn oxides tables s3 and s4 without bacteria was well described by both pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models suggesting that the as iii v adsorption process by fe mn oxides was a combination of physical and chemical adsorption dawodu and akpomie 2016 xu et al 2020 compared with the control groups without bacteria the removal efficiencies of as iii v by single fe and mn oxides with strain fmr were reduced mainly owing to the desorption of as adsorbed by single fe and mn oxides induced by bacteria for fe mn oxides bacteria did not induce the as adsorption desorption shift because the mn oxide component inhibited the reduction of the fe oxide component resulting in the synergistic promotion of as iii v immobilization via fe and mn oxide components moreover the present study indicated that the bacteria induced an increase in the removal efficiencies of both as iii and as v by fe mn oxides similar results were also observed by zhang et al 2007a in which more fresh adsorption sites were created owing to the abiotic reduction of the mn oxide components in synthetic fe mn oxides using na2so3 resulting in an increase in as v uptake under acidic conditions this reason is further supported mn ii being significantly released into the solution owing to biological reduction in as iii v immobilization by fe mn oxides with strain fmr figs 1c and 3c however for the as iii system zhang et al 2007a found that the as iii removal declined as the extent of the na2so3 treatment related abiotic mn iv reduction increased under acidic conditions the na2so3 treatment inhibited the oxidation of as iii by mn oxides to as v which is generally more effectively removed by fe oxides this is not similar to our results probably because the fe oxides have no significant differences in as iii and as v removal efficiencies and comparatively low initial contents in the present study figs 2b and 4b furthermore the sem analysis revealed that the bacterial cells adhered tightly to the fe mn oxide microparticles and the resulting fe mn oxides were a complex of embedded fe mn oxide microparticles and bacterial cells fig 5b implying that the involvement of cell induced fe mn oxides have the potential to supply more active sites for as iii v adsorption banfield et al 1999 lee and parsons 1999 zheng et al 2020 this is further supported by the bet specific surface areas of fe mn oxides increasing from 265 0 m2 g 1 initially to 286 1 m2 g 1 after biological reduction bai et al 2016 and hou et al 2020 studied fe mn oxides mediated by metal oxidizing bacteria under aerobic conditions the cycling of mn is expected in an anaerobic system like those used by bai et al 2016 and hou et al 2020 mn ii is released during the oxidation of as iii by fe mn oxides and the released mn ii can be re oxidized to mn iii or mn iv by metal oxidizing bacteria consequently creating more active adsorption sites for as v and as iii if secondary fe minerals are formed furthermore the newly precipitated ferrihydrite owing to the re oxidation of fe ii by the mn oxide component could enhance as iii v immobilization which is similar to the increase in as immobilization by sediment owing to the oxidation of fe ii by mn oxides he and hering 2009 therefore the bacteria induced increase in the immobilization of as iii v by fe mn oxides was likely caused by the combined effect of the creation of more fresh adsorption sites and the adsorption of as iii v by newly precipitated ferrihydrite in natural groundwater systems fe and mn oxides usually coexist and form fe mn oxides by co precipitation in the sediments bai et al 2016 fe mn oxides with high surface reactivity are crucial natural sinks of pollutants including as xue et al 2019 therefore according to our study fe mn oxides may be critical factors in the in situ immobilization of as iii v in as rich groundwater it has been hypothesized that as adsorbed on fe mn oxides would be re released into the aqueous phase owing to the reductive transformation of minerals and the change of as species induced by bacteria cai et al 2020 tufano and fendorf 2008 however we found that indigenous metal reducing bacteria with fe iii mn iv reducing abilities did not induce the shift of as adsorption desorption during the immobilization of as iii v by fe mn oxides this may be because the mn oxide component inhibited the reduction of the fe oxide component ehlert et al 2014 used a fe iii mn iii iv mixture system with which as v was pre equilibrated to understand how the presence of shewanella sp ana 3 as the famous model metal reducing strain that is also capable of respiring arsenate in addition to fe iii and mn iii iv minerals influences the mobility of as they found that increasing mn iii iv concentrations inhibited the formation and release of both fe ii and as iii at the beginning but ultimately the oxidation and sequestration of as iii in water logged soils and sediments is limited by the formation of secondary fe minerals and surface passivation processes on mn iii iv this is not entirely consistent with our results here we found that strain fmr induced an increase in as t removal during the immobilization of as iii by fe mn oxides compared with the control groups without bacteria despite the passivation of the mn oxide component caused by cell coating and mineral agglomeration did lead to a decrease in the oxidation of as iii adsorbed on the minerals these differences may be related to the capabilities of bacteria to reduce as v fe iii mn iv the species and contents of as fe mn the amount of secondary fe mineral coatings and the biomasses and activities of bacteria shewanella sp ana 3 is an as v respiring strain but strain fmr cannot reduce as v perhaps owing to the lack of the arra gene malasarn et al 2004 have demonstrated that the arra gene is required to catalyze the conversion of as v to as iii in fe rich systems with strain shewanella sp ana 3 furthermore the involvement of indigenous metal reducing bacteria enhanced the immobilization of as v by fe mn oxides compared with the control groups without bacteria thus our findings highlight the important role of mn oxides and indigenous metal reducing bacteria in the in situ immobilization of as iii v in as rich groundwater based on our findings we suggest two strategies for in situ remediation of reductive as rich groundwater soil i using biostimulation technology appropriately increasing the activity and intensity of environmentally friendly indigenous reducing bacteria in high as containing groundwater soil where fe mn oxides are widely distributed and ii appropriately increasing the production of mn oxides in high as containing groundwater soil 5 conclusions our study focused on as iii v immobilization by fe mn oxides in high arsenic groundwater systems in the presence of a newly isolated indigenous metal reducing bacteria bacillus sp fmr the results revealed that as v immobilization by fe mn oxides occurred through adsorption whereas the immobilization of as iii occurred though an oxidation coupled to adsorption approach in high as containing groundwater systems in which fe mn oxides are widespread the fe oxide component mainly acted as an adsorbent for as immobilization in situ whereas the mn oxide component dominated as iii oxidation the mn oxide component inhibited the bacteria induced reductive dissolution of the fe oxide component thus preventing the desorption of adsorbed as and causing a synergy between the two components to promote as iii v immobilization in addition indigenous bacteria induced increases in the specific surface area and active adsorption sites of fe mn oxides which enhanced the immobilization of as iii v indicating that indigenous metal reducing bacteria played vital roles in the in situ immobilization of as iii v in reductive as rich groundwater therefore biostimulation with indigenous metal reducing bacteria and the promotion of mn oxide production have powerful potential for in situ remediation of high as containing groundwater credit authorship contribution statement xinxin zhao conceptualization methodology software investigation writing original draft zuoming xie writing

3509,iron manganese binary oxides fe mn oxides have the potential to immobilize arsenite arsenate as iii v in situ in natural environments however the as iii v immobilization performances of fe mn oxides in the presence of indigenous metal reducing bacteria in reducing groundwater systems have received limited attention here as iii v immobilization by fe mn oxides and the interactions of fe and mn oxide components in groundwater in the presence of a newly isolated indigenous metal reducing bacterium bacillus sp fmr were investigated microcosm experiments were performed with artificial groundwater and mineral phases fe mn and fe mn oxides with as iii or as v in the presence or absence of strain fmr under anoxic conditions the fe oxides in anaerobic cultures without bacteria exhibited better immobilization performances for as iii 69 as t removal efficiency and as v 70 than mn oxides 19 and 17 respectively comparably the involvement of bacteria induced the re release of arsenic adsorbed on the single fe and mn oxides under anoxic conditions whereas this shift in arsenic adsorption desorption was not observed in fe mn oxide systems because the mn oxide components inhibited the reductive dissolution of the fe oxide components the as t removal efficiencies of fe mn oxides in the presence of bacteria increased by 17 for as iii and 16 for as v compared with anaerobic incubation without bacteria the interaction of fe and mn oxides in fe mn oxides resulted in a slightly increased mobilization of as iii v in the absence of bacteria whereas there was a synergistic effect in the presence of bacteria the favorability of indigenous bacteria for as iii v immobilization and the synergy between fe and mn oxides provide novel insights for in situ as iii v immobilization in high arsenic containing groundwater keywords arsenic immobilization indigenous bacteria fe mn binary oxides biostimulation high arsenic groundwater 1 introduction arsenic as a prevalent pollutant in soil and groundwater dia et al 2015 liao et al 2021 mccann et al 2018 threatens human health because of its high toxicity and potential carcinogenicity guo et al 2008 hou et al 2017 xie et al 2018 in groundwater as primarily occurs in two inorganic forms arsenate and arsenite which are negatively charged or neutral in normal ph ranges bai et al 2016 arsenite as iii is more toxic soluble and mobile than arsenate as v he et al 2019 zhang et al 2007b thus the oxidation process of as iii plays a very critical role in the natural remediation of as in groundwater he et al 2019 villalobos et al 2014 however as v produced by oxidation is still hazardous therefore oxidation coupled with subsequent adsorption represents a potential strategy for the in situ immobilization of as in groundwater he et al 2019 the adsorption of as by iron fe and manganese mn oxides is a vital pathway in restricting as migration in contaminated environments ehlert et al 2014 parikh et al 2010 in natural aquatic ecosystems fe oxides are mainly produced through the chemical oxidation of soluble fe ii borch et al 2010 whereas mn oxides are formed through the bio oxidation of mn ii learman et al 2011 tebo et al 2005 tran et al 2018 yu and leadbetter 2020 however soluble mn ii and fe ii commonly coexist in the groundwater environment and fe oxides bind with mn oxides to form fe mn oxides in situ through coprecipitation mccann et al 2018 accordingly fe mn oxides play vital roles in as immobilization in groundwater recently studies have focused on immobilizing as from contaminated soil and groundwater through natural and synthetic fe mn oxides under oxygenated conditions demonstrating that fe mn oxides possess excellent oxidation capacities and high adsorption abilities corresponding to those of single mn oxides and fe oxides respectively learman et al 2011 siddiqui et al 2019 zheng et al 2020 which simultaneously causes the oxidation of as iii and the effective adsorption of the formed as v moreover fe mn oxides do a better job of immobilizing as than single phases mccann et al 2018 which is unpredictable because mn oxides have very poor adsorption performances for as zhang et al 2014 therefore it is necessary to investigate simultaneously the contribution of each component of the fe mn oxides and the interaction between them to assess their removal of as the as cycle is closely related to microbial activities in the groundwater environment guo et al 2013 metal reducing and metal oxidizing bacteria play crucial roles in the oxidation and adsorption of as through mn or fe oxides he et al 2019 liao et al 2013 the biogenic fe mn oxides produced by mn oxidizing bacteria have the potential for the oxidation and adsorption of as owing to their high oxidizing power and specific surface area bai et al 2016 chang et al 2018 wang et al 2020 furthermore the bioaugmentation of mn oxidizing bacteria effectively decreases the pollutants of groundwater thereby improving its quality and producing drinking water bai et al 2016 however reducing bacteria causes the reduction and release of as from groundwater minerals including iron oxy hydroxides and mn oxides benner et al 2002 dia et al 2015 tufano and fendorf 2008 the bio reduction of as bearing fe mn oxides decreases the surface area of minerals and along with changes in as species causes the release of adsorbed arsenic on the minerals into the aqueous phase under anaerobic conditions tufano and fendorf 2008 however the reductive transformation of fe oxides initially decreases as elution owing to as incorporation during mineral restructuring coker et al 2006 continued anaerobic reduction eventually results in both the dissolution of fe oxides and the release of as tufano and fendorf 2008 however single fe oxides or mn oxides have mainly been studied with limited attention being paid to the fe mn oxides under anoxic conditions in this study we investigated the immobilization of as iii v in high as containing groundwater by fe mn oxides in the presence of indigenous metal reducing bacteria under anoxic conditions the objectives of this paper were as follows 1 to highlight the respective contributions and interactions of fe and mn oxide components in as immobilization in the groundwater system 2 to explore the mechanism of the reduction and release of fe and mn from fe mn oxides in the presence of indigenous bacteria and 3 to determine the effects of the reductive transformation of fe mn oxides caused by indigenous bacteria on the immobilization of as

xie et al 2013 the detailed isolation and purification steps for strain fmr are described in the supplementary information text s1 strain fmr s abilities to reduce fe iii ferric citrate 28 mg l 1 mn iv mno2 28 mg l 1 and as v na2haso4 7h2o 1 mg l 1 were measured under anaerobic conditions furthermore the effects of as iii as naaso2 0 1 5 10 and 30 mg l 1 and as v as naaso4 12h2o 0 1 5 10 and 30 mg l 1 on the growth of strain fmr were determined by measuring the optical density of the cultures at 600 nm od600 nm using an ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer the experiments were performed in triplicate all the manipulations were conducted in an anoxic glovebox containing 5 co2 10 h2 and 85 n2 to provide an anaerobic environment the strain was inoculated into a slightly modified minimal salts medium mmsm cai et al 2020 this medium contained the following components mg l nacl 1 000 nh4cl 250 kh2po4 20 kcl 500 cacl2 10 mgcl2 6h2o 60 sodium acetate 800 yeast extract 200 n 2 hydroxylpiperazine n 2 ethanesulfonic acid hepes 2 383 at ph 7 20 the removal effectiveness of as iii naaso2 1 mg l 1 or as v naaso4 12h2o 1 mg l 1 through single and binary fe and mn oxides was determined using a series of batch experiments the mmsm approximately 200 ml amended with as iii v was distributed into 250 ml serum bottles under a high nitrogen atmosphere after autoclaving for 20 min at 121 c the log phase bacterial cultures were washed with 0 8 nacl three times and then inoculated 2 into the mmsm the bacterial cell number was determined by counting the colony forming units on the luria bertani lb solid culture medium using dilution plating rathod et al 2019a ye et al 2020 for batch experiments 200 mg l 1 of fe mn or fe mn oxides were added in batches to the mmsm in sealed serum bottles in which strain fmr had reached an initial cell density of 106 cells ml in an anoxic glove box control groups without bacterial inoculum were run to compare for evidence of any abiotic changes each experimental condition was used in triplicate sampling was performed at regular intervals in the anoxic glove box between samplings the bottles were cultured in the dark in a shaking incubator 30 c and 150 rpm outside the glove box ehlert et al 2014 2 4 aqueous sample analysis concentrations of fe total t fe ii mn ii as total t and different as species as iii and as v remaining in the medium were monitored for the aqueous samples each was filtered through 0 22 μm membrane as iii and as v were separated in accordance with le et al 2000 and the concentrations of different as species were analyzed using hydride generation atomic fluorescence spectroscopy afs 9700 beijing haiguang instrument co ltd china the soluble fe ii and fe t concentrations were measured by ferrozine spectrophotometry at 562 nm in accordance with viollier et al 2000 the fe iii concentration was calculated using the difference between the concentrations of fe t and fe ii whereas fe iii was precipitated at ph 2 in the absence of a ligand he et al 2018 the dissolved mn ii level was determined by formaldehyde oxime spectrophotometry he et al 2019 removal kinetics of as iii v via fe mn oxides were fitted via pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models in the absence of bacteria xu et al 2020 2 5 statistical analysis the results are presented as means standard deviations of at least three independent replicates data were analyzed using an analysis of variance spss 17 0 usa with statistically significant differences set at p less than 0 05 3 results 3 1 isolation and identification of indigenous metal reducing bacteria the colonies of strain fmr were both white and round on lb solid culture medium fig s1 table s1 the sem images fig s2 showed that the cell morphology was a straight long rod shape with a width of 0 8 1 0 μm and a length of 3 0 4 5 μm the physiological and biochemical properties of strain fmr table s2 were consistent with the general description of bacillus species cai et al 2016 xie et al 2013 furthermore the 16s rrna gene sequences of strain fmr were analyzed using basic local alignment search tool blast the results revealed that strain fmr was highly homologous with bacillus cereus strain 19 w 99 the phylogenetic analysis also showed that strain fmr clustered together with these bacillus species fig s3 indicating strain fmr was a member of the bacillus family these corroborating identification indicators allowed the final identification of strain fmr as bacillus sp fmr the strain bacillus sp fmr genbank 16s rrna accession number ol598581 was preserved at the state key laboratory of biogeology and environmental geology china university of geosciences wuhan china the capacity of strain fmr for reducing fe iii fig s4a and mn iv fig s4b in the mmsm were investigated strain fmr reduced 76 of fe iii to fe ii in a ferric citrate solution 28 mg l 1 dissolved fe iii throughout the experiment 0 11 days moreover the mn bio reduction efficiency in an mno2 suspension solution 28 mg l 1 insoluble mn iv reached 81 in control groups without bacterial cells fe ii was not appreciably detected in the solution and mn ii reached as low as approximately 1 83 mg l 1 the soluble mn ii released in the control groups was likely due to the reductive dissolution with the ligand assisted dissolution of mn iv mno2 because sodium acetate was present in the culture medium biver and shotyk 2012 carrasco et al 2008 kiczka et al 2010 zhang et al 2007b the growth of strain fmr under different as v or as iii concentrations is shown in fig s5 we observed that bacterial growth slowed down as the as iii v concentration increased from 1 to 30 mg l 1 suggesting that increasing as iii v concentration inhibited the strain s growth kinetics however strain fmr demonstrated tolerable growth at up to 30 mg l 1 as v fig s5a and 30 mg l as iii fig s5b furthermore strain fmr had similar growth kinetics during the 1 mg l 1 as v and 1 mg l 1 as iii indicating that the effects of as species on the growth of strain fmr was negligible at 1 mg l 1 as v iii 3 2 characterization of initial minerals the specific surface areas of mn fe and fe mn oxides were 78 8 212 1 and 265 1 m2 g 1 respectively the xrd analysis of fe mn oxides and their components revealed that both fe and mn oxides in the fe mn oxides mainly exist in their non crystalline form fig s6 the xrd patterns of the initial fe oxides exhibited two broad peaks 35 and 63 of 2 θ which were indexed to the amorphous 2 line ferrihydrite the mn oxides near 37 and 66 of 2 θ were interpreted as amorphous δ mno2 the sem analysis revealed that the surfaces of fe oxides fig s7a and fe mn oxides fig s7c were very rough and contained porous structures indicating that fe oxides and fe mn oxides have the potential to provide abundant active sites for as adsorption the energy dispersion spectrum showed that the molar ratio of fe mn in fe mn oxides was about 3 0 which was similar to the value about 3 3 detected after digestion 3 3 as v removal compared with the control groups without bacteria strain fmr liberated fe ii into solution from fe oxides during as v immobilization fig 1 a however the release of fe ii from fe mn oxides in the presence of fmr began to increase slowly after approximately 4 days until the maximum concentration of only 0 93 mg l 1 was reached on day 11 fig 1a the variation trend of fe t liberated from fe mn oxides and single fe oxides were similar to those of corresponding fe ii during the experiment fig 1a and b and dissolved fe iii was not detected in any filtration solution mn ii was obviously released from fe mn oxides and single mn oxides in the presence of strain fmr reaching maximum concentrations of 38 33 and 16 97 mg l 1 respectively fig 1c during the experiment the fe ii and mn ii were not appreciably released from fe mn and fe mn oxides in the absence of strain fmr the buffers used in the medium in all the reaction systems ensured that the ph changed remained relatively stable changing from an initial ph of 7 20 to a final ph of 7 04 7 13 fig s9b the medium containing only strain fmr and as v revealed that fmr alone did not result in the reduction and adsorption of as v fig s8a during as v immobilization by fe oxides without strain fmr the aqueous as v concentration decreased rapidly from 1 000 to 364 00 μg l 1 within 2 days and then stabilized after 4 days the final as t removal efficiency was 70 fig 2 b the removal of as v by fe oxides with strain fmr in the first 4 days fig 2a was similar to that of the system without bacteria in the solution however aqueous as v began to desorb after 4 days and then the as t removal efficiency decreased to 54 unlike fe oxides mn oxides exhibited very low adsorption performances for as v in the absence 17 as removal efficiency and presence 8 of strain fmr fig 2c and d for fe mn oxides the as v concentration decreased from 1 000 to 281 61 μg l 1 in the absence of bacteria fig 2f and from 1000 to 163 66 μg l 1 in the presence of strain fmr fig 2e resulting in as t removal efficiencies of 72 and 84 respectively as iii was not detected in any of the as v immobilization reaction systems during the 11 day incubation period fig 2a f furthermore the kinetic model for as v immobilization with fe mn oxides in the absence of bacteria table s3 showed that both pseudo first order r2 0 954 and pseudo second order kinetic models r2 0 987 well described the as v adsorption kinetic 3 4 as iii removal the change trends of soluble fe ii and mn ii in the as iii immobilization system fig 3 a c were similar to those of the corresponding as v system fig 1a c fe ii was significantly released from fe oxides with strain fmr whereas the bio reduction of fe iii from fe mn oxides was not observed fig 3a during the entire test period the ph of the as iii systems did not change significantly fig s10b the incubation containing only strain fmr and as iii revealed that the oxidation and adsorption capacities of strain fmr for as iii were not significant fig s8b the trend of fe oxides to remove as iii fig 4 a and b was similar to that of as v fig 2a and b during as iii immobilization by fe oxides without bacteria the aqueous as iii concentration decreased rapidly and then stabilized after 4 days resulting in an as t removal efficiency of 69 corresponding to the as t concentration decreasing from 1 000 to 310 99 μg l 1 fig 4b however as iii was desorbed after 3 days and then the as t removal efficiency decreased to 53 in the fe oxide system with strain fmr as v was not detected in any of the as iii immobilization systems with fe oxides implying that fe oxides had no as iii oxidation capacities unlike fe oxides mn oxides exhibited low adsorption capacities but high oxidation activities for as iii and the as t removal efficiencies were 19 and 9 in the absence and presence of strain fmr respectively fig 4c and d the fe mn oxides integrated the chemical properties of both fe and mn oxides and thus they could not only rapidly oxidize but also effectively adsorb as species fig 4 moreover the as t adsorption capacities of fe mn oxides mediated by strain fmr were higher than that without bacteria with as t removal efficiencies of 86 and 74 respectively fig 4e and f furthermore the kinetic model for as iii immobilization with fe mn oxides in the absence of bacteria table s4 showed that both pseudo first order r2 0 950 and pseudo second order kinetic models r2 0 986 well described the as iii adsorption kinetic 3 5 surface analysis of fe mn oxides the x ray diffraction xrd analysis of fe mn oxides indicated that no significant mineral phase transition occurred in amorphous fe mn oxides after reaction with as iii v or after incubation with strain fmr fig s11 a sem analysis was conducted using mineral particles after incubation with bacteria under anaerobic conditions to verify the morphology of bacteria and fe mn oxides as well as the effective contacts between strain fmr and fe mn oxides rathod et al 2019a fe mn oxides maintained their original granular particles without significant changes in morphology after incubation without fmr fig 5 a and s7c whereas bio reduced fe mn oxides showed some morphological changes fig 5b these sem observations of incubated minerals demonstrated that the direct contact between the bacterial cells and the mineral surface induced mineral agglomeration through biological activities rathod et al 2019b and the resulting fe mn oxides were a complex of embedded fe mn oxide microparticles and bacterial cells fig 5b furthermore the bet specific surface areas of fe mn oxides increased from 265 0 m2 g 1 initially to 286 1 m2 g 1 after incubation with fmr the xps analysis was performed to determine the surface compositions on fe mn oxides the binding energy of the fe 2p spectrum on the initial fe mn oxides surface was 711 0 electron volt ev which was attributed to fe iii hou et al 2020 indicating that fe iii was the predominant fe species fig 6 a the binding energies of the fe 2p spectra on the fe mn oxides surfaces did not change significantly after reaction with as iii v or bio reduction the mn 2p spectrum 642 6 ev on the initial fe mn oxides surface suggested that mn iv was the predominant mn species fig 6b the mn 2p spectra showed that no obvious change occurred for the binding energies of mn 2p spectra on the surfaces of fe mn oxides without strain fmr after reacting with as iii v fig 6b nevertheless the binding energies of mn 2p spectra with strain fmr decreased from 642 6 to 642 1 and 642 0 ev relative to that of the initial fe mn oxides after reacting with as v and as iii respectively fig 6b indicating that bacteria induced an increase in the proportion of reduced mn mn ii mn iii compared with tetravalent mn commonly the binding energies of as 3d at 44 2 44 5 and 45 2 45 6 ev in as oxides are attributed to as iii and as v respectively zheng et al 2020 the as 3d spectra indicated that as v was the predominant as species adsorbed by fe mn oxides with fig 7 b or without fig 7a strain fmr after reacting with as v the as 3d spectrum of fe mn oxides in the as iii immobilization system fig 8 b was similar to that in the as v immobilization system fig 7a in the absence of fmr suggesting that the dominant as species adsorbed on fe mn oxides without strain fmr in as iii immobilization was as v with a binding energy of 45 4 ev this further confirmed that as iii was oxidized effectively to as v through fe mn oxides in the absence of strain fmr nevertheless the as 3d spectrum of fe mn oxides with strain fmr in as iii immobilization showed two peaks fig 8a which were attributed to as iii 44 4 ev and as v 45 5 ev 4 discussion in this study the indigenous bacterium bacillus sp fmr isolated from as rich aquifer sediment exhibited high resistance to as iii v fig s5 and demonstrated a high reducing capacity for dissolved fe iii and insoluble mn iv fig s4 similar metal reducing bacteria such as bacillus sp ht 1 kocar et al 2006 and bacillus subterraneus sp nov kanso et al 2002 have also been isolated and reported in previous studies the present results demonstrated that strain fmr induced the release of fe ii and mn ii from the single fe and mn oxides into solution during the immobilization of as iii v for fe mn oxides mn ii was significantly released into the solution in the presence of strain fmr whereas fe ii was only slightly released at the later stage of the experiment implying that mn oxides inhibited the formation and release of fe ii in fe mn oxides with strain fmr there are three possible reasons for this reaction first the bio reduction of fe iii and mn iv followed thermodynamic properties in which the reduction of mn iv took precedence over fe iii borch et al 2010 second microbially generated fe ii was rapidly re oxidized to ferrihydrite by the mn oxide component ehlert et al 2014 this reason is supported by the abiotic fe ii oxidation which demonstrated that fe ii feso4 7h2o 0 02 g l 1 was almost completely oxidized by mn oxides 0 2 g l 1 within 10 min under anoxic conditions fig s12 similar results were also observed by ehlert et al 2014 during an abiotic oxidation experiment in which about 95 of fe ii was almost instantly oxidized by birnessite furthermore the xrd analysis revealed that the diffraction patterns of fe mn oxides were identical before and after bio reduction fig s11 indicating that the fe oxide phase was still ferrihydrite in fe mn oxides after bio reduction these normal xrd analyses are insufficient to identify new mineral phases owing to bacterial weathering rathod et al 2019a techniques such as synchrotron nano diffraction have high potential to characterize the localized surface modification of minerals owing to bacterial weathering rathod et al 2019b the xps analysis revealed that the main fe species on the fe mn oxides surface was still fe iii after biological reduction fig 6a which also supported this reason third the metal reduction capacities of the bacteria were weakened owing to the decrease in bacterial biomass and activity level in the later stage of the experiment despite mn oxides being consumed zhang et al 2018 this was supported by the decreased bacterial cell density in the later stage of incubation figs s9a and s10a thus the inhibition of the mn oxide component on the formation and release of fe ii induced by bacteria in fe mn oxides might result from a combination of the thermodynamic priority for the reduction of mn iv the reoxidation of fe ii by mn oxides and the attenuation of bacterial activity during the later incubation stages fe mn oxides are widely present in shallow groundwater environments and their fe and mn oxide components play different roles in as immobilization amirbahman et al 2006 hou et al 2017 in this study the fe oxide components of fe mn oxides mainly acted as adsorbents for as immobilization whereas the mn oxide components only acted as oxidants figs 2 and 4 similar results have been reported in which the fe oxide components of fe mn oxides were mainly responsible for as adsorption bai et al 2016 mn oxides can effectively adsorb a variety of metal cations such as zn cd and pb bai et al 2016 zhou et al 2015 however single mn oxides showed a low adsorption capacity for as in this study figs 2 and 4 which may be due to as being an oxygen anion song et al 2021 as iii exists mainly as uncharged h3aso3 0 at a neutral ph whereas as v exists primarily in anionic forms as haso4 2 and h2aso4 bai et al 2016 the roles of the fe and mn oxide components of fe mn oxides in as iii v immobilization in the presence of strain fmr were similar to those of the corresponding controls without bacteria figs 2 and 4 however bacteria induced the adsorption desorption shift during the reaction of single fe mn oxides with as which was mainly attributed to the bio reduction of single fe mn oxides cai et al 2020 in addition in some cases there is an interaction between fe and mn oxide components during the adsorption of as by fe mn oxides zheng et al 2020 the interaction of the two elements generally includes antagonism synergy or additive effect zhao et al 2020 in this study the as t removal efficiency of fe mn oxides increased slightly to 72 and 74 in as v fig 2b d and f and as iii fig 4b d and f immobilization systems respectively without fmr relative to the single phases implying that additive effect between fe and mn oxide components was observed with a slight increase in as v as iii immobilization in the absence of strain fmr remarkably in the presence of strain fmr the as t removal efficiencies of the fe mn oxides were clearly greater than those of the single fe and mn oxides in the as v fig 2a c and e and as iii fig 4a c and e immobilization systems indicating that the synergy between fe and mn oxide components was present in as immobilization in the presence of strain fmr this result is mainly attributed to the bio reduction of single fe mn oxides weakening the immobilization of as whereas the bacteria do not decrease the as immobilization of fe mn oxides owing to the mn oxide component inhibiting the reductive dissolution of the fe oxide component the results indicated that strain fmr had negligible effects on the redox and adsorption of as iii v fig s6a b this result is similar to that of bai et al 2016 in which the oxidation and adsorption of as species were attributed to biogenic fe mn minerals formed in situ in aerobic cultures rather than to pseudomonas sp qjx 1 conversely other studies have reported that certain bacteria can effectively bioaccumulate as iii v in solution ayangbenro and babalola 2017 rathod et al 2019b the inconsistent conclusions on the bioaccumulation abilities of bacteria for as can be attributed to differences in as concentrations bacterial biomasses and bacterial as binding capacities rathod et al 2019a the present results showed that both the free fig 2e and f and adsorbed as species fig 7a and b were as v in as v immobilization by fe mn oxides with or without strain fmr therefore the immobilization mechanism of fe mn oxides on as v is mainly adsorption removal for as iii immobilization fe mn oxides were found to be able to not only oxidize as iii effectively but also adsorb it fig 4 this result is further supported by the xps analysis fig 8b in which as iii adsorbed on the surface of fe mn oxides was completely oxidized to as v by the mn oxide component without strain fmr both as iii and as v species were adsorbed on the surfaces of fe mn oxides in as iii immobilization with strain fmr given that as iii was not completely oxidized fig 8a the abiotic oxidation activity of the mn oxide component to adsorbed as iii was reduced in the presence of bacteria and this decrease was attributable to i bio reduction of the mn oxide component in the fe mn oxides fig 6b and ii passivation of the mn oxide component by cell coating and mineral agglomeration fig 5 hence the immobilization mechanism of fe mn oxides on as iii is an approach of oxidation coupled with adsorption as follows first aqueous as iii is adsorbed onto the surface of fe mn oxides second adsorbed as iii is oxidized to as v by the mn oxide component on the surface third the as v generated by oxidation is released from the surface of fe mn oxides into the solution ultimately the generated as v is re adsorbed onto other sites on the surfaces of fe mn oxides the kinetic model fitting results showed that as iii v immobilization by fe mn oxides tables s3 and s4 without bacteria was well described by both pseudo first order and pseudo second order kinetic models suggesting that the as iii v adsorption process by fe mn oxides was a combination of physical and chemical adsorption dawodu and akpomie 2016 xu et al 2020 compared with the control groups without bacteria the removal efficiencies of as iii v by single fe and mn oxides with strain fmr were reduced mainly owing to the desorption of as adsorbed by single fe and mn oxides induced by bacteria for fe mn oxides bacteria did not induce the as adsorption desorption shift because the mn oxide component inhibited the reduction of the fe oxide component resulting in the synergistic promotion of as iii v immobilization via fe and mn oxide components moreover the present study indicated that the bacteria induced an increase in the removal efficiencies of both as iii and as v by fe mn oxides similar results were also observed by zhang et al 2007a in which more fresh adsorption sites were created owing to the abiotic reduction of the mn oxide components in synthetic fe mn oxides using na2so3 resulting in an increase in as v uptake under acidic conditions this reason is further supported mn ii being significantly released into the solution owing to biological reduction in as iii v immobilization by fe mn oxides with strain fmr figs 1c and 3c however for the as iii system zhang et al 2007a found that the as iii removal declined as the extent of the na2so3 treatment related abiotic mn iv reduction increased under acidic conditions the na2so3 treatment inhibited the oxidation of as iii by mn oxides to as v which is generally more effectively removed by fe oxides this is not similar to our results probably because the fe oxides have no significant differences in as iii and as v removal efficiencies and comparatively low initial contents in the present study figs 2b and 4b furthermore the sem analysis revealed that the bacterial cells adhered tightly to the fe mn oxide microparticles and the resulting fe mn oxides were a complex of embedded fe mn oxide microparticles and bacterial cells fig 5b implying that the involvement of cell induced fe mn oxides have the potential to supply more active sites for as iii v adsorption banfield et al 1999 lee and parsons 1999 zheng et al 2020 this is further supported by the bet specific surface areas of fe mn oxides increasing from 265 0 m2 g 1 initially to 286 1 m2 g 1 after biological reduction bai et al 2016 and hou et al 2020 studied fe mn oxides mediated by metal oxidizing bacteria under aerobic conditions the cycling of mn is expected in an anaerobic system like those used by bai et al 2016 and hou et al 2020 mn ii is released during the oxidation of as iii by fe mn oxides and the released mn ii can be re oxidized to mn iii or mn iv by metal oxidizing bacteria consequently creating more active adsorption sites for as v and as iii if secondary fe minerals are formed furthermore the newly precipitated ferrihydrite owing to the re oxidation of fe ii by the mn oxide component could enhance as iii v immobilization which is similar to the increase in as immobilization by sediment owing to the oxidation of fe ii by mn oxides he and hering 2009 therefore the bacteria induced increase in the immobilization of as iii v by fe mn oxides was likely caused by the combined effect of the creation of more fresh adsorption sites and the adsorption of as iii v by newly precipitated ferrihydrite in natural groundwater systems fe and mn oxides usually coexist and form fe mn oxides by co precipitation in the sediments bai et al 2016 fe mn oxides with high surface reactivity are crucial natural sinks of pollutants including as xue et al 2019 therefore according to our study fe mn oxides may be critical factors in the in situ immobilization of as iii v in as rich groundwater it has been hypothesized that as adsorbed on fe mn oxides would be re released into the aqueous phase owing to the reductive transformation of minerals and the change of as species induced by bacteria cai et al 2020 tufano and fendorf 2008 however we found that indigenous metal reducing bacteria with fe iii mn iv reducing abilities did not induce the shift of as adsorption desorption during the immobilization of as iii v by fe mn oxides this may be because the mn oxide component inhibited the reduction of the fe oxide component ehlert et al 2014 used a fe iii mn iii iv mixture system with which as v was pre equilibrated to understand how the presence of shewanella sp ana 3 as the famous model metal reducing strain that is also capable of respiring arsenate in addition to fe iii and mn iii iv minerals influences the mobility of as they found that increasing mn iii iv concentrations inhibited the formation and release of both fe ii and as iii at the beginning but ultimately the oxidation and sequestration of as iii in water logged soils and sediments is limited by the formation of secondary fe minerals and surface passivation processes on mn iii iv this is not entirely consistent with our results here we found that strain fmr induced an increase in as t removal during the immobilization of as iii by fe mn oxides compared with the control groups without bacteria despite the passivation of the mn oxide component caused by cell coating and mineral agglomeration did lead to a decrease in the oxidation of as iii adsorbed on the minerals these differences may be related to the capabilities of bacteria to reduce as v fe iii mn iv the species and contents of as fe mn the amount of secondary fe mineral coatings and the biomasses and activities of bacteria shewanella sp ana 3 is an as v respiring strain but strain fmr cannot reduce as v perhaps owing to the lack of the arra gene malasarn et al 2004 have demonstrated that the arra gene is required to catalyze the conversion of as v to as iii in fe rich systems with strain shewanella sp ana 3 furthermore the involvement of indigenous metal reducing bacteria enhanced the immobilization of as v by fe mn oxides compared with the control groups without bacteria thus our findings highlight the important role of mn oxides and indigenous metal reducing bacteria in the in situ immobilization of as iii v in as rich groundwater based on our findings we suggest two strategies for in situ remediation of reductive as rich groundwater soil i using biostimulation technology appropriately increasing the activity and intensity of environmentally friendly indigenous reducing bacteria in high as containing groundwater soil where fe mn oxides are widely distributed and ii appropriately increasing the production of mn oxides in high as containing groundwater soil 5 conclusions our study focused on as iii v immobilization by fe mn oxides in high arsenic groundwater systems in the presence of a newly isolated indigenous metal reducing bacteria bacillus sp fmr the results revealed that as v immobilization by fe mn oxides occurred through adsorption whereas the immobilization of as iii occurred though an oxidation coupled to adsorption approach in high as containing groundwater systems in which fe mn oxides are widespread the fe oxide component mainly acted as an adsorbent for as immobilization in situ whereas the mn oxide component dominated as iii oxidation the mn oxide component inhibited the bacteria induced reductive dissolution of the fe oxide component thus preventing the desorption of adsorbed as and causing a synergy between the two components to promote as iii v immobilization in addition indigenous bacteria induced increases in the specific surface area and active adsorption sites of fe mn oxides which enhanced the immobilization of as iii v indicating that indigenous metal reducing bacteria played vital roles in the in situ immobilization of as iii v in reductive as rich groundwater therefore biostimulation with indigenous metal reducing bacteria and the promotion of mn oxide production have powerful potential for in situ remediation of high as containing groundwater credit authorship contribution statement xinxin zhao conceptualization methodology software investigation writing original draft zuoming xie writing
