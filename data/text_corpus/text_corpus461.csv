2305,with increasing urban flood risk due to urbanisation and climate change flood hazard prediction is ever more crucial for flood risk management and emergency response however when sufficient high quality data are lacking a standard flood inundation modelling approach has significant uncertainties therefore this study develops a bottom up approach for urban flood hazard mapping at multiple levels grid kilometre district built upon the integration of grid based flood modelling with data acquisition from open sources this reduces the adverse effects of data scarcity and quality on hazard modelling in the paper we first set out an integrated approach for gridded inundation mapping in an urban basin using a hydrodynamic model supported by crowd sourced social media data then applying the model to flooding in chengdu in august 2020 we articulate how input data bias and parameter uncertainty both affect urban inundation modelling the results show that the choice of terrain data and the quantification of urban drainage flows significantly influence the modelled urban inundation extent depth and duration this indicates the potential for large variation when using urban inundation mapping merely relying on a single scale flood hydrodynamic modelling even when supported by crowd sourced data the multilevel hazard mapping approach developed here presents multi layered and comprehensive inundation mapping thus the effects of data bias or availability are reduced and the coarser hazard mapping shows less sensitivity to the data input quality and model uncertainty indicating relatively higher reliability at this higher spatial scale the grid kilometre district three level approach provides more reliable flood hazard mapping which can support rainstorm induced flood management in data scarce cities keywords urban flooding social media flood modelling multilevel inundation mapping data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction recent evidence has shown that urban flooding is becoming more frequent and severe due to urban development and climate change fowler et al 2021 ipcc 2021 tellman et al 2021 as a global hazard urban flooding causes significant damage and socio economic impact kundzewicz et al 2020 tellman et al 2021 for example an extreme rainstorm triggered severe flooding in zhengzhou on july 20 2021 causing at least 398 deaths and cny 120 billion direct economic losses disaster investigation team of the state council of china 2022 during and shortly after a flood event information on the flood extent and its impact is generally scarce however rapid assessment of inundation hazard is vital for flood and emergency managers to allocate resources to the affected areas in a timely manner as previously studied real time or pre post mapping the flooded regions is critical for flood hazard assessment and emergency response and is thus indispensable for flood resilience and preparedness currently the most common means of mapping flood hazard are empirical methods data driven models decision making models and physical based models mudashiru et al 2021 recent studies have increasingly investigated the applicability of data driven models in flood hazard mapping for example kabir et al 2020 proposed a deep convolutional neural network cnn model for rapid prediction of fluvial flood inundation extent and depths lin et al 2020 developed an artificial neural network ann to create fluvial inundation maps using multiple high resolution discharge inflows as input these studies demonstrate the merits of data driven models in terms of high computational efficiency nonetheless most existing studies only applied such models in fluvial rather than urban flood mapping this may be due to the model training relying heavily on the prior simulations of hydrodynamic models which experience large limitations caused by data availability and bias the lack of sufficient data may hinder their application in urban inundation mapping in data scarce cities a recent study by lin et al 2022 attempted to develop deep neural networks for rapid urban scale flood risk mapping with the aid of scarce social media data as a training dataset but uncertainties are still significant due to data scarcity other empirical models such as the multi criteria decision making mcdm method has also been successfully applied in mapping flood hazard at a large scale these have ranked uncertainties associated with model components with the help of gis remote sensing data and even different expert viewpoints e g franci et al 2016 rahmati et al 2019 ekmekcioglu et al 2021 ekmekcioglu et al 2021 proposed a new hierarchical procedure to generate district based flood risk map by considering 13 flood vulnerability and hazard criteria these studies show a way to quickly map flood hazard or risk at a large scale but they are more often used as prior flood hazard mapping based on historical events they are thus also subject to the challenge data availability mudashiru et al 2021 and are not feasible for generating inundation maps in real time or shortly after an event physical based flood hydrodynamic models were rapidly developed and increasingly used for urban inundation simulation dosallas et al 2022 including the shallow water based dynamic models e g guan et al 2013 glenis et al 2018 sanders and schubert 2019 xia et al 2019 simplified or complexity reduced dynamic models e g bates et al 2010 coles et al 2017 leandro et al 2009 and other commercially available software also studies have widely focused on flood simulations at multiple scales e g hydrology based fluvial inundation modelling at large scale e g yamazaki et al 2014 coarser scale hydrodynamic modelling to reduce computational costs e g chen et al 2012 pe√±a and nardi 2018 as well as multiscale fluvial inundation modelling from the perspective of adaptive mesh refinement e g kirstetter et al 2020 dasallas et al 2022 however physical based flood models rely heavily on the accuracy and resolution of the terrain data digital surface elevation models whose quality is not assured in many city regions grohmann 2018 high quality topographic data for main flow pathways such as urban rivers are rarely available even in developed countries moramarco et al 2019 and targeted field surveys are expensive and limited to local scale therefore as key underlying data of flood dynamic models the errors and uncertainties in the terrain data are still significant for modelling of inundation extents and depths in addition models with detailed pipe networks are affected by the availability and quality of the required pipe data which complicates the modelling significantly qiang et al 2021 particularly for city scale modelling parameters related to land use and infiltration e g manning s roughness infiltration rate are also sources of uncertainty for large scale flood modelling the modelled inundation is influenced by both these parameters and their combination with the terrain resolution thus physical based flood modelling suffers to a considerable extent from the limitations caused by data availability particularly the availability of inundation information bed terrain models and the physical properties of the underlying surfaces such as roughness capacity of drainage and infiltration in some cases this is even more significant than the structure of a model willis et al 2019 additionally a rainstorm s resolution also has significant implications for inundation model accuracy radar rainfall measurement is now increasingly available but in general has a spatial resolution of 1 km previous studies have indicated that a sophisticated high resolution dynamic model does not necessarily imply higher accuracy in the simulated results if the rainfall resolution is lower than the model resolution e g peleg et al 2017 only when the similar or higher spatial resolution of rainfall is input to drive the model is there a chance of achieving more accurate results but still only under the conditions of good quality underlying data mentioned above overall hydrodynamic modelling has become the preferred option for inundation mapping dasallas et al 2022 despite the uncertain factors and a wide range of variabilities the lack of adequate high quality validation data can further amplify these uncertainties however public open source data from social media are increasingly available for flood events as a supplementary data source alongside remote sensing imagery despite some limitations crowd sourced data sources can capture severe inundation observed at multiple locations in a timely manner without expensive or prior investment e g brown et al 2021 smith et al 2017 guo et al 2022 the improvements in the quality of the crowd sourced data enable them to serve as a robust references for model validation in data scarce cities thereby enabling the rapid estimation of inundation of flood affected areas guo et al 2022 as already mentioned it is challenging to map urban inundation in data scarce cities particularly during or shortly after an extreme event traditional inundation mapping merely uses inundation extents and depths at a single spatial scale which may bring in greater uncertainties as with modelling inundation at a broader city scale the local dynamic deviation e g in terms of water depth becomes less important than the inundation extent which directly reports the sites affected by a flood in order to inform emergency response therefore the reliability of flood hazard assessment could be improved by developing an appropriate broader hazard assessment approach at multiple levels based on traditional hydrodynamic modelling in this regard this study seeks to develop a multi level bottom up urban flood hazard mapping approach to reduce the adverse effects of data availability and bias it aims to do this by a grid level mapping based on hydrodynamic modelling with support of social media data b kilometre level mapping the same resolution as the rainfall radar c district level mapping a community based scale hazard mapping taking the 2020 chengdu flooding as a case study we first present a two dimensional 2d flood hydrodynamic model and apply it to explore how input data bias and parameters uncertainties affect urban inundation modelling then we validate the modelled inundation using 232 flood points previously detected from multiple social data sources guo et al 2022 finally we verify how and to what extent the developed multi level hazard mapping approach upscaling from the hydrodynamic modelling diminishes the adverse effects of data availability and modelling variabilities it is noted that the study is mapping the flood hazard which is the threat of an area being inundated by a flooding but not mapping the flood risk which involves flood hazard exposure and vulnerability 2 methodology 2 1 study area chengdu a city of flat terrain experienced severe flooding in august 2020 with cumulative rainfall of over 580 mm guo et al 2022 the greater chengdu basin has a catchment area of 14335 km2 fig 1 a and it is a mainly flat urbanised area with about 70 urbanisation fig 1b also there are 12 rivers in the basin given the flat terrain dense river networks and humid climate chengdu has always been a hotspot of flood risk 2 2 data acquisition the data used in this study are summarised in table 1 including terrain data as the underlying bed surfaces rainfall data as the model driver and inundation data for model verification terrain data the terrain data used include 1 the processed digital terrain model dtm fig a1a based on the original alos world 3d 30 m aw3d30 data for chengdu with a resolution of 30 m and 2 a new source of bare earth digital elevation model dem fabdem hawker et al 2022 as a cross reference rainfall data the data includes 1 time series data at 1 min interval in five rain gauge stations as shown in fig 1 b and 2 rainfall radar product with 1 km spatial resolution and 1 h temporal resolution the rainfall period covers 10 august 2022 to 18 august 2022 the rainfall radar was compared with the monitored rainfall data at the five gauge stations to verify its spatiotemporal accuracy the comparison in figure s1 supplementary materials shows that both datasets match very well in both trend and peak values throughout the whole rainfall period apart from the xindu station where the rainfall radar has larger peak values and the wenjiang station where one event has a mismatch in the occurrence time for the wenjiang station it was confirmed that the gauge station data have an error in timing because the rainfall event in fact occurred at midnight 15 august rather than 14 august as shown in the other four stations for the mismatch between the radar and the local gauge station at wenjiang we found that the radar data of these storm events are highly unevenly distributed spatially figure s1 this demonstrates the importance of using spatial rainfall distribution as flood model input in general the verification ensures the spatial rainfall radar with 1 km resolution represents the actual rainfall conditions reasonably well inundation data from open sources for the 2020 chengdu flooding guo et al 2022 have developed a crowd sourced approach to successfully collect 232 geo tagged inundation spots across the greater chengdu basin the approach effectively filters and excludes the intervention of unrepresentative data we found that most of these spots are in the chengdu city area because that is where most of the participants live these flood spots provide key information on where the flooding occurred although the exact flood extent is not obtained such data can still be used as a flood indicator for inundation modelling in addition water depths are extracted from the images gathered by referring to the heights of the corresponding structures and buildings figure s2 provided in supplementary materials e g water depths at 8 points were roughly estimated and they are used for validating the simulated depths in the same locations section 3 3 2 3 urban surface water hydrodynamic model 2 3 1 governing equations a 2d flood dynamic model based on shallow water equations swes was adopted for simulating the city scale urban inundation guan et al 2016 guo et al 2021 the governing equations are expressed by 1 h t h u x h v y i i d model 2 h u t x h u 2 1 2 g h 2 h u v y s bx s fx 3 h v t h u v x y h v 2 1 2 g h 2 s by s fy where x and y are the two cartesian directions t is time h is the water depth u and v are the x and y components of the flow velocity g is the gravitational acceleration i denotes the rainfall intensity i is the infiltration term and dmodel represents the grid based maximum drainage capacity defined by a model below sbx and sby are the bed slope terms in the x and y directions respectively sfx and sfy are frictional source terms in the x and y directions respectively the discretisation of both bed slope and frictional slope terms has been investigated thoroughly in past studies and a well balanced approach developed by xia et al 2019 is used in this study 2 3 2 infiltration treatment infiltration is particularly important for hydrological processes driven by light rainfall during flooding soil is generally considered to be saturated although the effect of infiltration on inundation mapping is weak or even negligible infiltration loss over saturated soils i in eq 1 is estimated in this research by the commonly used green ampt infiltration equation eq 4 4 f t k s œÜ f h o z f 1 where ks is the hydraulic conductivity of the soil at field saturation œÜ f is the capillary potential across the wetting front ho is the ponding water on the soil surface and zf is cumulative depth of infiltration the value of capillary potential is kept at a constant of 0 73 m yu et al 2016 2 3 3 specification of drainage capacity urban stormwater drainage systems play a crucial role in draining rainfall induced surface water the system s maximum drainage capacity significantly affects the urban inundation extent depth and duration on urban surfaces however existing inundation models with the inclusion of detailed pipe networks are rarely applied to a city scale event due to the significant amount of pipe data required typically millions of service holes and pipes yu et al 2016 therefore a simplified treatment is usually developed for a city scale inundation model as each pipe network has a specific drainage capacity that is represented by specifying the amount of surface runoff drained by the network butler davies 2018 yu et al 2016 yu et al 2016 and yu coulthard 2015 suggested using a maximum design drainage capacity and no loss of capacity due to service hole surcharge on a cell by cell basis however drainage capacity is rarely uniform and constant during a flood event driven by a varying rainfall thus this study implements a distributed varying drainage capacity depending on the relation between rainfall intensity and design drainage capacity of pipe network as set out below at the first stage of rainfall if rainfall intensity i is smaller than the maximum drainage capacity dmax and the cell is dry the actual drainage capacity dmodel is set to equal to rainfall intensity i e if i dmax dmodel i if surface inundation occurs and rainfall intensity is larger than maximum drainage capacity the maximum drainage capacity is applied to drain surface water i e if i dmax dmodel dmax during the recession period if the grid cell is still wet water depth is larger than the wet dry depth htol the drainage capacity at such model grid will remain at a maximum in the model i e if h htol and i dmax dmodel dmax 2 4 bottom up inundation hazard mapping as articulated in the introduction data scarcity and availability are an issue for detailed urban inundation modelling particularly in data scarce cities there is a limit on how far data can be used to calibrate and validate an inundation model therefore inundation mapping that relies merely on the simulated water depths may lead to considerable discrepancies a dynamic flood model can simulate both water depth and velocity but direct use of these variables as indicators for flood hazard can be challenging with low terrain accuracy and uncertain model parameters also inundation modelling is driven by the spatiotemporal resolution of rainfall which is the main model driver thus here we propose to use multilevel inundation hazard mapping through upscaling from the grid based hydrodynamic modelling to diminish the data and model effects three spatial levels are proposed fig 2 namely a grid based hazard mapping based on fine hydrodynamic modelling with support of social media data b kilometre level hazard mapping which has the same spatial resolution as the rainfall radar c district level hazard mapping based on the city s community divisions where the general public generally are in receipt of frequent communication the three level upscaling approach grid kilometre district allows for use of the fine scale model at a lower resolution where the uncertainties are less the mapping method at each level is described below based on fig 2 2 4 1 grid level hazard mapping a major cause of death in flood events is when people attempt to walk or drive in the floodwaters arrighi et al 2019 therefore grid level hazard assessment criteria are analysed considering both factors pedestrians and vehicles for pedestrians we applied a commonly used empirical expression eq 5 for rating inundation hazards wade et al 2005 that is based on water depth and flow velocity 5 hr 0 001 h v 0 5 d f where hr is the flood hazard parameter h is water depth mm v is the velocity of flow m s and df is a coefficient depending on the threat posed by debris and the value is assumed to be 0 5 wade et al 2005 the hazard class for pedestrians fp is divided into four parts wade et al 2005 as shown in table 2 below for vehicles pregnolato et al 2017 developed a relationship eq 6 between vehicle speed and submerged water depth based on a review of experimental observational and modelling data 6 w h 0 0009 h 2 0 5529 h 86 9448 where h is water depth mm w is maximum safe velocity km h of a vehicle at specific water depths using the speed limit level in transport networks the detailed hazard class for vehicles fv is shown in the table 2 combining the two parts of flood hazard criteria the comprehensive flood hazard rating fr approach eq 7 was adopted to rate grid level hazards for human safety three classes l m h are categorised table 2 which corresponds to orange red and dark red in fig 2 b 7 fr max f p f v i f h 300 f r f p i f h 300 2 4 2 kilometre level hazard mapping kilometre level mapping is used in alignment with the spatial resolution 1 km of rainfall radar which is the main driver of the grid based hydrodynamic model to perform the upscaling we introduce a hazard frequency ratio denoted as hfr of a flood hazard class rather than inundation depths hfr is defined as the ratio of a category s percentage of flooded area to total at hazard area in a domain of 1 km2 using the outcome of the grid level hazard distribution akay 2021 considering the magnitude of the three hazard levels the kilometre level hazard assessment criteria are established as follows 1 if the hfr of high hazard is larger than 1 the flood hazard of the 1 km2 domain is treated as high h 2 otherwise if the hfr of medium hazard is larger than 10 the flood hazard of the 1 km2 domain is considered medium m 3 otherwise if the hfr of low hazard is larger than 50 the flood hazard of the 1 km2 domain is treated as low l 4 otherwise the area is defined as safe 2 4 3 district level hazard mapping districts are an important community based unit where people communicate frequently in a city such as chengdu chengdu has 156 districts based on the community information from the national geomatics centre of china 2018 http www ngcc cn ngcc hazard mapping at the district level is helpful for community based flood management and information exchange ekmekcioƒülu et al 2021 at this level we applied a multi criteria decision making mcdm method vikor opricovic tzeng 2004 to prioritise the flood hazard level at all the districts the vikor method carries out the following steps first database normalisation is applied to the area proportion of each hazard class l m h in each district f ij 8 f ij f ij i 1 m f ij 2 where j l m h indicates the hazard class defined in table 1 i 1 2 156 indicates the serial number of each district f ij indicates the normalised area proportion of each hazard class in various districts second we determine the best value denoted as f j and the worst value denoted as f j of the normalised area proportion f ij using eq 9 it is noted that a smaller area proportion of each hazard class means the safer condition thus the negative ideal solution nis is applied stating that the minimum f ij is best and the maximum f ij is worst 9 f j min i f ij f j max i f ij third the values for the group utility denoted as si and individual regret denoted as ri are calculated using equations below 10 s i j 1 n w j f j f ij f j f j 11 r i max j w j f j f ij f j f j where w j are the weights of each criteria hazard class expressing their relative importance the weights are set to 0 2 to hazard class l 0 3 to hazard class m and 0 5 to hazard class h fourth the vikor index qi is an evaluation parameter to prioritise the district flood hazards its values are then calculated using the eqs 12 eq 14 below 12 q i v s i s s s 1 v r i r r r 13 s max i s i s min i s i 14 r max i r i r min i r i v is taken here to be 0 5 opricovic tzeng 2004 finally the calculated vikor index qi is used to prioritise the flood hazard ranking for all the 156 districts the higher the vikor index the higher the flood hazard level of the corresponding district is 2 5 simulation scenarios key parameters used for inundation modelling are set out in table 3 including the infiltration parameter ks the drainage network capacity and the manning s roughness coefficient as the city scale is large and it is hard to determine the exact value of the parameters a few sets of values are used for these parameters in this study based on the land use type and guideline reference engman 1986 zeng et al 2020 specifically maximum and minimum values are used for ks in table 3 besides using the full design drainage capacity in urban areas urbanised portion in fig 1a we also assume 50 and 80 of full drainage network capacity in the modelling if the system cannot fully drain floodwaters e g due to blockage sensitivities of flood models based on dynamic and diffusive wave flood models have been widely evaluated in past studies e g neal et al 2012 willis et al 2019 model sensitivity was tested with mesh size 20 m 30 m and 60 m which indicated that the results are less affected by mesh size than they are by input data bias and the choice of terrain data based on the known relations and the unknown exact parameters in this study we simulated a possible range of inundation extents and depths rather than fixed values using the parameters in table 3 in these ranges the lower bound of the range denotes the simulated areas under high infiltration and drainage scenarios and the upper bound indicates the simulated areas under low infiltration and drainage scenarios it is noted that the model domain for the sensitivity analysis is selected to be the chengdu city centre fig 1b which is further elaborated in section 3 2 this reduced domain is adequate to reproduce the surface inundation processes during the events considered without exhausting the computation resources as compared to modelling the entirety of chengdu 3 results and discussion 3 1 inundation modelling with input data scarcity and bias 3 1 1 role of dem data the resolution of dems influences the simulated inundation depth and extent due to the misrepresentation of urban surfaces such as building treatment in flood modelling jiang et al 2022 however as reviewed above the key challenge for urban inundation modelling is that of obtaining high quality terrain data which are not readily available especially in developing countries fig 3 shows that the simulated urban inundation using different dems lead to obvious deviations it is seen that the inundation depths using the processed dem aw3d30 level2 without refinement of river channels fig 3a are greater than that using aw3d30 level3 with refined channel bathymetries fig 3b for most areas of the city more floodwaters gather around the rivers in the modelled result based on aw3d30 level2 fig 3a this is caused by the less smooth surfaces with bumps and pits on the terrain of the riverbed and floodplains as well as discontinuities caused by roads and bridges these obstacles and discontinuities significantly hinder the floodwater conveyance within the basins and outside alongside this the upstream terrain features are the same for aw3d30 level2 and aw3d30 level3 therefore more floodwaters accumulate near the river channels while less accumulates further upstream in addition fig 3 c shows the simulated inundation using the recently produced dem fabdem which removes buildings and forests from copdem30 hawker et al 2022 the results lead to more floodwater accumulation through gullies with less on urban surfaces however the inundation area still covers about 78 of the 232 flood hotspots that were collected from social media this is smaller than 85 coverage by the inundation modelled in fig 3 b the widespread difference shown in fig 3 e indicates that a clear deviation exists even if the same set of model parameters are used this is because the terrain surface of fabdem is much more bare and smoother than the other dem sources i e it is a pure earth terrain without much variation due to infrastructure and vegetation thus it is easier for surface floodwaters to flow into streams as shown in fig 3 c by contrast the original terrain data aw3d30 includes buildings and urban infrastructures which despite the processing of terrain surfaces are unavoidable due to the limitation of the grid resolution and the slope based algorithm although being more faithful to surface obstacles water pathways may be distorted under a fine spatial scale due to the spurious local terrain slope connectivity recent studies indicate considerable simulation errors when the dem grid size is larger than the building width jiang et al 2022 muthusamy et al 2021 the comparison confirms that the choice of terrain data processing method can lead to discrepancies in the modelled inundation if the area of interest lacks high quality data with sufficient land surface detail as input 3 1 2 role of drainage capacity it is important but challenging to include complex pipe networks in a flood model at city scale because of data scarcity and data size qiang et al 2021 yu et al 2016 yu coulthard 2015 particularly for data scarce cities when detailed modelling for drainage flows is not feasible simplified treatment is required as service hole blockages frequently occur the designed drainage capacity may not be achieved in reality coles et al 2017 in view of this concern our study has tested 0 50 80 and 100 of the designed maximum drainage capacity in flood modelling as a comparison fig 4 plots the percentage of the simulated inundation area to the total urban area varying with time it shows that the consideration of pipe drainage with its full design capacity drains floodwaters quickly during and immediately after the rainfall event the simulated inundation area in general increases with more rainfall events if drainage is restricted only a slight decrease occurs during the no rainfall period due to the infiltration fig 4 but pipe drainage plays a crucial role in draining floodwaters away from urban surfaces for simulations with 50 80 and 100 of the drainage capacity and the effects are particularly significant when the rainstorms stop this leads to a recession in urban inundation areas for simulations with drainage flows fig 4 the differences can also be observed from the simulated spatial inundation depths and extent illustrated in fig 5 inundation depths significantly increase due to the accumulated storage of floodwaters on urban surfaces fig 5b c it is seen that both inundation extent and depths are larger under a smaller drainage capacity implying a greater potential flood hazard the results demonstrate that errors on inundation extent and depth can be caused by the common practice of treating drainage flows as a sink term for city scale flood modelling e g yu et al 2016 xing et al 2019 3 2 cross boundary effects on inundation modelling common practice for inundation prediction is to perform the modelling based on the domain of interest upon which both the dem and model meshes are built however unlike natural catchments urban catchments have many surfaces that have been subject to human intervention the city boundary may be different from the corresponding basin boundary which might bring in further discrepancies when modelling inundation based only on the city domain errors may still exist even if modelling is performed on an urban basin that is generated using the available dem data owing to the data bias compared with reality the effects of cross boundary surface water flows i e additional floodwaters may enter or leave the simulated domain are investigated here by performing inundation modelling using the dems of the city centre and of the greater chengdu basin fig 1 fig 6 shows that the overall trends of the percentage of inundation area over urban area and water depths are broadly similar for both scenarios there is a slight difference in the inundation area across the city during the first series of rainfall events 11 and 12 august and the more local simulation which is only based on chengdu city generates a slightly broader inundation area in other words more floodwaters leave the simulated domain when we upscale the modelling from only chengdu city centre to the greater chengdu basin however the differences are not significant during the rainfall events thereafter the direct comparison of inundation area and depths figure s3 shows small differences within 0 1 m with the difference mostly in the northwest of chengdu and around the urban rivers and the domain boundary fig s3a however when assuming zero drainage flows the differences between inundation scenarios of the city centre and the greater basin domain fig s3b are more apparent but still insignificant compared with those caused by input data bias and uncertain parameters thus the simulations for analysis below are conducted using only the chengdu city area for reason of high computational efficiency 3 3 model validation with crowd sourced data one of the challenges for any urban inundation model is obtaining good quality validation data given uncertainties from the multiple data and parameters discussed above in section 3 1 as well as data availability it is not feasible to conduct exact model calibration and validation with the support of the crowd sourced flood spots presented in section 2 2 evaluations of the grid based inundation model are performed first the 232 flood hotpots are successfully collected and identified from social media using crowd sourced approach previously developed by the authors guo et al 2022 a circular buffer area with a radius of 300 m is set to these points considering the uncertainty of the data reported by public source i e an area within 300 m of each hotspot is considered to be flooded second the 232 flood hotspots and their buffer area are then used to compare with the modelled inundation then we calculate the percentage of the coverage points by the simulated inundation to the total 232 flood hotspots and list the results in table s1 it is noted that this is to evaluate the general model performance in the identification of spatial urban inundation fig 7 shows that the simulated maximum inundation area covers most of the crowd sourced flood hotspots despite the effects of model parameters the simulated minimum inundation water depth greater than 2 cm under high infiltration and drainage scenarios still covers over 76 of the reported flood locations fig 7a and table s1 in the case of the low drainage and infiltration there are more flood hotspots 88 8 table s1 falling within the simulated inundation regions for scenarios in between fig 7b the coverage percentage does not differ markedly however the inundation depth and flooded area clearly increase with the smaller drainage and infiltration this implies that inappropriate quantification of drainage and infiltration flows can lead to poor estimations on inundation magnitude and extent overall among all simulation scenarios the model simulated an inundation region in the city that covers 76 89 of the crowd sourced flood points in addition we estimate a range of water depths for each flood hotspot location identified from social media figure s2 by taking objects e g cars persons in the images as a reference of water level the estimated ranges of the water depths are compared with the simulated water depths at the similar locations and the comparison is plotted in fig 8 it shows similar magnitudes in the water depths but the exact values still differ between the modelled and extracted results we consider the results to be acceptable if the depth magnitudes are broadly similar for the modelled results ensemble depths by a variety of parameter setups are plotted it shows that the simulated and estimated water depths agree generally well despite the acceptable discrepancy the test cases show overall agreement between the modelled inundation and the estimated flood hotspots the validation is anticipated not to be perfect with errors because of the identified causes in a variety of limitations in data and model variables it is also manifest that we cannot merely rely on the simulated depths at a single scale as inundation mapping upscaling to diminish the effects of such errors would be appreciated 4 multilevel urban inundation mapping as mentioned above the scarcity of data in many cities particularly in emerging and developing economies creates challenges for urban flood modelling when used for enhancing resilience as the results above demonstrate this data scarcity can lead to levels of uncertainty that make it difficult use the results with confidence in view of this the existing flood mapping approaches using grid based hydrodynamic modelling e g glenis et al 2018 xia et al 2019 sanders and schubert 2019 might lead to large uncertainties in data scarce cities it is even much more challenging to apply data driven models such as ann or cnn e g lin et al 2021 kabir et al 2021 lin et al 2022 to map urban flood hazard given that they are also dependent data availability whilst coarse scale hydrology based models are available for flood mapping e g yamazaki et al 2014 they are more for fluvial flooding with the support of river discharge data validations therefore taking grid based flood modelling as a basis the upscaling approach grid kilometre district proposed here can improve the reliability of the flood mapping in data scarce cities here we have investigated how the results with uncertainties at the finest level based on scarce data can be upscaled to a level where the results are more certain and where despite being at a coarser resolution they are fit for purpose unlike the results at a finer scale as well as reducing resolution we also convert the inundation variables into a hazard mapping specifically a bottom up multi level dynamic hazard mapping over time we investigate whether this can go some way towards reducing the effects of model result variability using the approach proposed in section 2 4 we produce hazard mapping at three spatial levels from the simulated grid level to the upscaled district level the three level hazard mapping for the maximum inundation of the 2020 chengdu flooding is generated and illustrated in fig 9 overall it shows that the increase in spatial scale mitigates the impact of the variabilities in the model outputs making the hazard mapping less sensitive to the uncertainties of modelled results by comparing grid level hazard mapping under low and high infiltration and drainage flows fig 9a b we can see that the variation of the modelled results directly leads to a difference in the gridded level hazard mapping i e there are differences for the hazard classes in the 60 m grids however when upscaling the hazard map from 60 m to kilometre level fig 9c d the difference is diminished it is seen that the high risk cells are roughly similar for both conservative modelling high infiltration and drainage and riskiest modelling low infiltration and drainage and many low and medium hazard cells are well represented by both simulation scenarios this implies that the coarser hazard mapping shows less sensitivity to the uncertainty of data input and model indicating higher reliability moreover a further upscaling of the hazard map to district level fig 9e f can further diminish the variation because the new mapping approach at district level can take the priority of the districts to be flooded into consideration rather than just considering the modelled values of water depth and velocities moreover it is noted that the three level approach can generate dynamic inundation mapping over time i e the grid kilometre district mapping changes with the flooding time thus it has the strength of grid based flood models in tracking the hazard zones dynamically and the outcome is multi layered and more comprehensive but less uncertain once an extreme rainfall is nowcast or recorded e g rainfall radar nowcasting product the proposed approach can convert the predicted rainfall to three level hazard mapping which supports flood management ahead of during or immediately after a flooding first at district level the districts with relative potential of flooding can be identified suggesting the areas in the city that should be given more attention for flood emergency response and rescue and the community can also efficiently communicate the potential severity of a flooding to raise people s awareness second at kilometre and grid levels the hazard mappings can suggest more specific hazard areas for emergency response despite the relative higher variability of the results due to data bias and availability as discussed above specific preparedness could be suggested based on the hazard mapping particularly for critical infrastructures and vulnerable facilities e g utilities power plants hospitals potentially exposure to a flooding 5 conclusions it is common that high quality underlying datasets to support urban inundation modelling are not readily available in many cities across the world this leads to a wide range of variations in urban inundation modelling this study examined this challenge by first exploring how the data or chosen model can lead to modelling discrepancies based on comprehensive modelling using a series of designed scenarios in the 2020 chengdu flooding table 2 to diminish the adverse effects of data scarcity and bias on modelling results this study then developed a three level bottom up approach grid kilometre district for urban inundation mapping based on the integrated dynamic inundation modelling and open source data the main conclusions drawn from the results are the grid based flood hydrodynamic model can simulate detailed inundation depths and velocities dynamically over time however the simulated results demonstrate substantial variations when the supporting data is scarce to be specific the choice of the data processing approach for terrain data can lead to discrepancies in modelled inundation if the area of interest lacks high resolution dem data as flood model input out of all the key model variables drainage flow quantification plays the key role in urban inundation recession thereby influencing the modelled inundation area and floodwater depths significantly however the cross boundary effect is relatively insignificant compared with other uncertain parameter effects it is manifest that urban inundation mapping cannot merely reply on the simulated depths at a single grid scale by a flood hydrodynamic model in data scarce cities crowd sourced flood data flood locations estimated depths can be used to support the verification of a flood model despite inherent errors the data could reasonably suggest where and to what extent flooding occurs which is the most important concern for flood response the three level bottom up approach for urban flood mapping developed in this study diminishes modelling variations due to data bias or availability the method can provide inundation mapping dynamically over time at all grid kilometre and district levels the coarser hazard mapping shows less sensitivity to the uncertainty of data input and model choice indicating relevant higher reliability at a higher spatial scale the multi level method can generate more comprehensive but less uncertain dynamic hazard maps which in turn provides more reliable warnings for emergency response and more efficient resource allocation for flood resilience overall our findings help to improve understanding of how and to what extent input data such as terrain data drainage flow quantification influences grid based urban inundation modelling in view of this an upscaling multilevel model framework can help to reduce the adverse effects so providing more reliable urban inundation mapping the model can support rainstorm induced flood management in data scarce cities with greater confidence credit authorship

2305,with increasing urban flood risk due to urbanisation and climate change flood hazard prediction is ever more crucial for flood risk management and emergency response however when sufficient high quality data are lacking a standard flood inundation modelling approach has significant uncertainties therefore this study develops a bottom up approach for urban flood hazard mapping at multiple levels grid kilometre district built upon the integration of grid based flood modelling with data acquisition from open sources this reduces the adverse effects of data scarcity and quality on hazard modelling in the paper we first set out an integrated approach for gridded inundation mapping in an urban basin using a hydrodynamic model supported by crowd sourced social media data then applying the model to flooding in chengdu in august 2020 we articulate how input data bias and parameter uncertainty both affect urban inundation modelling the results show that the choice of terrain data and the quantification of urban drainage flows significantly influence the modelled urban inundation extent depth and duration this indicates the potential for large variation when using urban inundation mapping merely relying on a single scale flood hydrodynamic modelling even when supported by crowd sourced data the multilevel hazard mapping approach developed here presents multi layered and comprehensive inundation mapping thus the effects of data bias or availability are reduced and the coarser hazard mapping shows less sensitivity to the data input quality and model uncertainty indicating relatively higher reliability at this higher spatial scale the grid kilometre district three level approach provides more reliable flood hazard mapping which can support rainstorm induced flood management in data scarce cities keywords urban flooding social media flood modelling multilevel inundation mapping data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction recent evidence has shown that urban flooding is becoming more frequent and severe due to urban development and climate change fowler et al 2021 ipcc 2021 tellman et al 2021 as a global hazard urban flooding causes significant damage and socio economic impact kundzewicz et al 2020 tellman et al 2021 for example an extreme rainstorm triggered severe flooding in zhengzhou on july 20 2021 causing at least 398 deaths and cny 120 billion direct economic losses disaster investigation team of the state council of china 2022 during and shortly after a flood event information on the flood extent and its impact is generally scarce however rapid assessment of inundation hazard is vital for flood and emergency managers to allocate resources to the affected areas in a timely manner as previously studied real time or pre post mapping the flooded regions is critical for flood hazard assessment and emergency response and is thus indispensable for flood resilience and preparedness currently the most common means of mapping flood hazard are empirical methods data driven models decision making models and physical based models mudashiru et al 2021 recent studies have increasingly investigated the applicability of data driven models in flood hazard mapping for example kabir et al 2020 proposed a deep convolutional neural network cnn model for rapid prediction of fluvial flood inundation extent and depths lin et al 2020 developed an artificial neural network ann to create fluvial inundation maps using multiple high resolution discharge inflows as input these studies demonstrate the merits of data driven models in terms of high computational efficiency nonetheless most existing studies only applied such models in fluvial rather than urban flood mapping this may be due to the model training relying heavily on the prior simulations of hydrodynamic models which experience large limitations caused by data availability and bias the lack of sufficient data may hinder their application in urban inundation mapping in data scarce cities a recent study by lin et al 2022 attempted to develop deep neural networks for rapid urban scale flood risk mapping with the aid of scarce social media data as a training dataset but uncertainties are still significant due to data scarcity other empirical models such as the multi criteria decision making mcdm method has also been successfully applied in mapping flood hazard at a large scale these have ranked uncertainties associated with model components with the help of gis remote sensing data and even different expert viewpoints e g franci et al 2016 rahmati et al 2019 ekmekcioglu et al 2021 ekmekcioglu et al 2021 proposed a new hierarchical procedure to generate district based flood risk map by considering 13 flood vulnerability and hazard criteria these studies show a way to quickly map flood hazard or risk at a large scale but they are more often used as prior flood hazard mapping based on historical events they are thus also subject to the challenge data availability mudashiru et al 2021 and are not feasible for generating inundation maps in real time or shortly after an event physical based flood hydrodynamic models were rapidly developed and increasingly used for urban inundation simulation dosallas et al 2022 including the shallow water based dynamic models e g guan et al 2013 glenis et al 2018 sanders and schubert 2019 xia et al 2019 simplified or complexity reduced dynamic models e g bates et al 2010 coles et al 2017 leandro et al 2009 and other commercially available software also studies have widely focused on flood simulations at multiple scales e g hydrology based fluvial inundation modelling at large scale e g yamazaki et al 2014 coarser scale hydrodynamic modelling to reduce computational costs e g chen et al 2012 pe√±a and nardi 2018 as well as multiscale fluvial inundation modelling from the perspective of adaptive mesh refinement e g kirstetter et al 2020 dasallas et al 2022 however physical based flood models rely heavily on the accuracy and resolution of the terrain data digital surface elevation models whose quality is not assured in many city regions grohmann 2018 high quality topographic data for main flow pathways such as urban rivers are rarely available even in developed countries moramarco et al 2019 and targeted field surveys are expensive and limited to local scale therefore as key underlying data of flood dynamic models the errors and uncertainties in the terrain data are still significant for modelling of inundation extents and depths in addition models with detailed pipe networks are affected by the availability and quality of the required pipe data which complicates the modelling significantly qiang et al 2021 particularly for city scale modelling parameters related to land use and infiltration e g manning s roughness infiltration rate are also sources of uncertainty for large scale flood modelling the modelled inundation is influenced by both these parameters and their combination with the terrain resolution thus physical based flood modelling suffers to a considerable extent from the limitations caused by data availability particularly the availability of inundation information bed terrain models and the physical properties of the underlying surfaces such as roughness capacity of drainage and infiltration in some cases this is even more significant than the structure of a model willis et al 2019 additionally a rainstorm s resolution also has significant implications for inundation model accuracy radar rainfall measurement is now increasingly available but in general has a spatial resolution of 1 km previous studies have indicated that a sophisticated high resolution dynamic model does not necessarily imply higher accuracy in the simulated results if the rainfall resolution is lower than the model resolution e g peleg et al 2017 only when the similar or higher spatial resolution of rainfall is input to drive the model is there a chance of achieving more accurate results but still only under the conditions of good quality underlying data mentioned above overall hydrodynamic modelling has become the preferred option for inundation mapping dasallas et al 2022 despite the uncertain factors and a wide range of variabilities the lack of adequate high quality validation data can further amplify these uncertainties however public open source data from social media are increasingly available for flood events as a supplementary data source alongside remote sensing imagery despite some limitations crowd sourced data sources can capture severe inundation observed at multiple locations in a timely manner without expensive or prior investment e g brown et al 2021 smith et al 2017 guo et al 2022 the improvements in the quality of the crowd sourced data enable them to serve as a robust references for model validation in data scarce cities thereby enabling the rapid estimation of inundation of flood affected areas guo et al 2022 as already mentioned it is challenging to map urban inundation in data scarce cities particularly during or shortly after an extreme event traditional inundation mapping merely uses inundation extents and depths at a single spatial scale which may bring in greater uncertainties as with modelling inundation at a broader city scale the local dynamic deviation e g in terms of water depth becomes less important than the inundation extent which directly reports the sites affected by a flood in order to inform emergency response therefore the reliability of flood hazard assessment could be improved by developing an appropriate broader hazard assessment approach at multiple levels based on traditional hydrodynamic modelling in this regard this study seeks to develop a multi level bottom up urban flood hazard mapping approach to reduce the adverse effects of data availability and bias it aims to do this by a grid level mapping based on hydrodynamic modelling with support of social media data b kilometre level mapping the same resolution as the rainfall radar c district level mapping a community based scale hazard mapping taking the 2020 chengdu flooding as a case study we first present a two dimensional 2d flood hydrodynamic model and apply it to explore how input data bias and parameters uncertainties affect urban inundation modelling then we validate the modelled inundation using 232 flood points previously detected from multiple social data sources guo et al 2022 finally we verify how and to what extent the developed multi level hazard mapping approach upscaling from the hydrodynamic modelling diminishes the adverse effects of data availability and modelling variabilities it is noted that the study is mapping the flood hazard which is the threat of an area being inundated by a flooding but not mapping the flood risk which involves flood hazard exposure and vulnerability 2 methodology 2 1 study area chengdu a city of flat terrain experienced severe flooding in august 2020 with cumulative rainfall of over 580 mm guo et al 2022 the greater chengdu basin has a catchment area of 14335 km2 fig 1 a and it is a mainly flat urbanised area with about 70 urbanisation fig 1b also there are 12 rivers in the basin given the flat terrain dense river networks and humid climate chengdu has always been a hotspot of flood risk 2 2 data acquisition the data used in this study are summarised in table 1 including terrain data as the underlying bed surfaces rainfall data as the model driver and inundation data for model verification terrain data the terrain data used include 1 the processed digital terrain model dtm fig a1a based on the original alos world 3d 30 m aw3d30 data for chengdu with a resolution of 30 m and 2 a new source of bare earth digital elevation model dem fabdem hawker et al 2022 as a cross reference rainfall data the data includes 1 time series data at 1 min interval in five rain gauge stations as shown in fig 1 b and 2 rainfall radar product with 1 km spatial resolution and 1 h temporal resolution the rainfall period covers 10 august 2022 to 18 august 2022 the rainfall radar was compared with the monitored rainfall data at the five gauge stations to verify its spatiotemporal accuracy the comparison in figure s1 supplementary materials shows that both datasets match very well in both trend and peak values throughout the whole rainfall period apart from the xindu station where the rainfall radar has larger peak values and the wenjiang station where one event has a mismatch in the occurrence time for the wenjiang station it was confirmed that the gauge station data have an error in timing because the rainfall event in fact occurred at midnight 15 august rather than 14 august as shown in the other four stations for the mismatch between the radar and the local gauge station at wenjiang we found that the radar data of these storm events are highly unevenly distributed spatially figure s1 this demonstrates the importance of using spatial rainfall distribution as flood model input in general the verification ensures the spatial rainfall radar with 1 km resolution represents the actual rainfall conditions reasonably well inundation data from open sources for the 2020 chengdu flooding guo et al 2022 have developed a crowd sourced approach to successfully collect 232 geo tagged inundation spots across the greater chengdu basin the approach effectively filters and excludes the intervention of unrepresentative data we found that most of these spots are in the chengdu city area because that is where most of the participants live these flood spots provide key information on where the flooding occurred although the exact flood extent is not obtained such data can still be used as a flood indicator for inundation modelling in addition water depths are extracted from the images gathered by referring to the heights of the corresponding structures and buildings figure s2 provided in supplementary materials e g water depths at 8 points were roughly estimated and they are used for validating the simulated depths in the same locations section 3 3 2 3 urban surface water hydrodynamic model 2 3 1 governing equations a 2d flood dynamic model based on shallow water equations swes was adopted for simulating the city scale urban inundation guan et al 2016 guo et al 2021 the governing equations are expressed by 1 h t h u x h v y i i d model 2 h u t x h u 2 1 2 g h 2 h u v y s bx s fx 3 h v t h u v x y h v 2 1 2 g h 2 s by s fy where x and y are the two cartesian directions t is time h is the water depth u and v are the x and y components of the flow velocity g is the gravitational acceleration i denotes the rainfall intensity i is the infiltration term and dmodel represents the grid based maximum drainage capacity defined by a model below sbx and sby are the bed slope terms in the x and y directions respectively sfx and sfy are frictional source terms in the x and y directions respectively the discretisation of both bed slope and frictional slope terms has been investigated thoroughly in past studies and a well balanced approach developed by xia et al 2019 is used in this study 2 3 2 infiltration treatment infiltration is particularly important for hydrological processes driven by light rainfall during flooding soil is generally considered to be saturated although the effect of infiltration on inundation mapping is weak or even negligible infiltration loss over saturated soils i in eq 1 is estimated in this research by the commonly used green ampt infiltration equation eq 4 4 f t k s œÜ f h o z f 1 where ks is the hydraulic conductivity of the soil at field saturation œÜ f is the capillary potential across the wetting front ho is the ponding water on the soil surface and zf is cumulative depth of infiltration the value of capillary potential is kept at a constant of 0 73 m yu et al 2016 2 3 3 specification of drainage capacity urban stormwater drainage systems play a crucial role in draining rainfall induced surface water the system s maximum drainage capacity significantly affects the urban inundation extent depth and duration on urban surfaces however existing inundation models with the inclusion of detailed pipe networks are rarely applied to a city scale event due to the significant amount of pipe data required typically millions of service holes and pipes yu et al 2016 therefore a simplified treatment is usually developed for a city scale inundation model as each pipe network has a specific drainage capacity that is represented by specifying the amount of surface runoff drained by the network butler davies 2018 yu et al 2016 yu et al 2016 and yu coulthard 2015 suggested using a maximum design drainage capacity and no loss of capacity due to service hole surcharge on a cell by cell basis however drainage capacity is rarely uniform and constant during a flood event driven by a varying rainfall thus this study implements a distributed varying drainage capacity depending on the relation between rainfall intensity and design drainage capacity of pipe network as set out below at the first stage of rainfall if rainfall intensity i is smaller than the maximum drainage capacity dmax and the cell is dry the actual drainage capacity dmodel is set to equal to rainfall intensity i e if i dmax dmodel i if surface inundation occurs and rainfall intensity is larger than maximum drainage capacity the maximum drainage capacity is applied to drain surface water i e if i dmax dmodel dmax during the recession period if the grid cell is still wet water depth is larger than the wet dry depth htol the drainage capacity at such model grid will remain at a maximum in the model i e if h htol and i dmax dmodel dmax 2 4 bottom up inundation hazard mapping as articulated in the introduction data scarcity and availability are an issue for detailed urban inundation modelling particularly in data scarce cities there is a limit on how far data can be used to calibrate and validate an inundation model therefore inundation mapping that relies merely on the simulated water depths may lead to considerable discrepancies a dynamic flood model can simulate both water depth and velocity but direct use of these variables as indicators for flood hazard can be challenging with low terrain accuracy and uncertain model parameters also inundation modelling is driven by the spatiotemporal resolution of rainfall which is the main model driver thus here we propose to use multilevel inundation hazard mapping through upscaling from the grid based hydrodynamic modelling to diminish the data and model effects three spatial levels are proposed fig 2 namely a grid based hazard mapping based on fine hydrodynamic modelling with support of social media data b kilometre level hazard mapping which has the same spatial resolution as the rainfall radar c district level hazard mapping based on the city s community divisions where the general public generally are in receipt of frequent communication the three level upscaling approach grid kilometre district allows for use of the fine scale model at a lower resolution where the uncertainties are less the mapping method at each level is described below based on fig 2 2 4 1 grid level hazard mapping a major cause of death in flood events is when people attempt to walk or drive in the floodwaters arrighi et al 2019 therefore grid level hazard assessment criteria are analysed considering both factors pedestrians and vehicles for pedestrians we applied a commonly used empirical expression eq 5 for rating inundation hazards wade et al 2005 that is based on water depth and flow velocity 5 hr 0 001 h v 0 5 d f where hr is the flood hazard parameter h is water depth mm v is the velocity of flow m s and df is a coefficient depending on the threat posed by debris and the value is assumed to be 0 5 wade et al 2005 the hazard class for pedestrians fp is divided into four parts wade et al 2005 as shown in table 2 below for vehicles pregnolato et al 2017 developed a relationship eq 6 between vehicle speed and submerged water depth based on a review of experimental observational and modelling data 6 w h 0 0009 h 2 0 5529 h 86 9448 where h is water depth mm w is maximum safe velocity km h of a vehicle at specific water depths using the speed limit level in transport networks the detailed hazard class for vehicles fv is shown in the table 2 combining the two parts of flood hazard criteria the comprehensive flood hazard rating fr approach eq 7 was adopted to rate grid level hazards for human safety three classes l m h are categorised table 2 which corresponds to orange red and dark red in fig 2 b 7 fr max f p f v i f h 300 f r f p i f h 300 2 4 2 kilometre level hazard mapping kilometre level mapping is used in alignment with the spatial resolution 1 km of rainfall radar which is the main driver of the grid based hydrodynamic model to perform the upscaling we introduce a hazard frequency ratio denoted as hfr of a flood hazard class rather than inundation depths hfr is defined as the ratio of a category s percentage of flooded area to total at hazard area in a domain of 1 km2 using the outcome of the grid level hazard distribution akay 2021 considering the magnitude of the three hazard levels the kilometre level hazard assessment criteria are established as follows 1 if the hfr of high hazard is larger than 1 the flood hazard of the 1 km2 domain is treated as high h 2 otherwise if the hfr of medium hazard is larger than 10 the flood hazard of the 1 km2 domain is considered medium m 3 otherwise if the hfr of low hazard is larger than 50 the flood hazard of the 1 km2 domain is treated as low l 4 otherwise the area is defined as safe 2 4 3 district level hazard mapping districts are an important community based unit where people communicate frequently in a city such as chengdu chengdu has 156 districts based on the community information from the national geomatics centre of china 2018 http www ngcc cn ngcc hazard mapping at the district level is helpful for community based flood management and information exchange ekmekcioƒülu et al 2021 at this level we applied a multi criteria decision making mcdm method vikor opricovic tzeng 2004 to prioritise the flood hazard level at all the districts the vikor method carries out the following steps first database normalisation is applied to the area proportion of each hazard class l m h in each district f ij 8 f ij f ij i 1 m f ij 2 where j l m h indicates the hazard class defined in table 1 i 1 2 156 indicates the serial number of each district f ij indicates the normalised area proportion of each hazard class in various districts second we determine the best value denoted as f j and the worst value denoted as f j of the normalised area proportion f ij using eq 9 it is noted that a smaller area proportion of each hazard class means the safer condition thus the negative ideal solution nis is applied stating that the minimum f ij is best and the maximum f ij is worst 9 f j min i f ij f j max i f ij third the values for the group utility denoted as si and individual regret denoted as ri are calculated using equations below 10 s i j 1 n w j f j f ij f j f j 11 r i max j w j f j f ij f j f j where w j are the weights of each criteria hazard class expressing their relative importance the weights are set to 0 2 to hazard class l 0 3 to hazard class m and 0 5 to hazard class h fourth the vikor index qi is an evaluation parameter to prioritise the district flood hazards its values are then calculated using the eqs 12 eq 14 below 12 q i v s i s s s 1 v r i r r r 13 s max i s i s min i s i 14 r max i r i r min i r i v is taken here to be 0 5 opricovic tzeng 2004 finally the calculated vikor index qi is used to prioritise the flood hazard ranking for all the 156 districts the higher the vikor index the higher the flood hazard level of the corresponding district is 2 5 simulation scenarios key parameters used for inundation modelling are set out in table 3 including the infiltration parameter ks the drainage network capacity and the manning s roughness coefficient as the city scale is large and it is hard to determine the exact value of the parameters a few sets of values are used for these parameters in this study based on the land use type and guideline reference engman 1986 zeng et al 2020 specifically maximum and minimum values are used for ks in table 3 besides using the full design drainage capacity in urban areas urbanised portion in fig 1a we also assume 50 and 80 of full drainage network capacity in the modelling if the system cannot fully drain floodwaters e g due to blockage sensitivities of flood models based on dynamic and diffusive wave flood models have been widely evaluated in past studies e g neal et al 2012 willis et al 2019 model sensitivity was tested with mesh size 20 m 30 m and 60 m which indicated that the results are less affected by mesh size than they are by input data bias and the choice of terrain data based on the known relations and the unknown exact parameters in this study we simulated a possible range of inundation extents and depths rather than fixed values using the parameters in table 3 in these ranges the lower bound of the range denotes the simulated areas under high infiltration and drainage scenarios and the upper bound indicates the simulated areas under low infiltration and drainage scenarios it is noted that the model domain for the sensitivity analysis is selected to be the chengdu city centre fig 1b which is further elaborated in section 3 2 this reduced domain is adequate to reproduce the surface inundation processes during the events considered without exhausting the computation resources as compared to modelling the entirety of chengdu 3 results and discussion 3 1 inundation modelling with input data scarcity and bias 3 1 1 role of dem data the resolution of dems influences the simulated inundation depth and extent due to the misrepresentation of urban surfaces such as building treatment in flood modelling jiang et al 2022 however as reviewed above the key challenge for urban inundation modelling is that of obtaining high quality terrain data which are not readily available especially in developing countries fig 3 shows that the simulated urban inundation using different dems lead to obvious deviations it is seen that the inundation depths using the processed dem aw3d30 level2 without refinement of river channels fig 3a are greater than that using aw3d30 level3 with refined channel bathymetries fig 3b for most areas of the city more floodwaters gather around the rivers in the modelled result based on aw3d30 level2 fig 3a this is caused by the less smooth surfaces with bumps and pits on the terrain of the riverbed and floodplains as well as discontinuities caused by roads and bridges these obstacles and discontinuities significantly hinder the floodwater conveyance within the basins and outside alongside this the upstream terrain features are the same for aw3d30 level2 and aw3d30 level3 therefore more floodwaters accumulate near the river channels while less accumulates further upstream in addition fig 3 c shows the simulated inundation using the recently produced dem fabdem which removes buildings and forests from copdem30 hawker et al 2022 the results lead to more floodwater accumulation through gullies with less on urban surfaces however the inundation area still covers about 78 of the 232 flood hotspots that were collected from social media this is smaller than 85 coverage by the inundation modelled in fig 3 b the widespread difference shown in fig 3 e indicates that a clear deviation exists even if the same set of model parameters are used this is because the terrain surface of fabdem is much more bare and smoother than the other dem sources i e it is a pure earth terrain without much variation due to infrastructure and vegetation thus it is easier for surface floodwaters to flow into streams as shown in fig 3 c by contrast the original terrain data aw3d30 includes buildings and urban infrastructures which despite the processing of terrain surfaces are unavoidable due to the limitation of the grid resolution and the slope based algorithm although being more faithful to surface obstacles water pathways may be distorted under a fine spatial scale due to the spurious local terrain slope connectivity recent studies indicate considerable simulation errors when the dem grid size is larger than the building width jiang et al 2022 muthusamy et al 2021 the comparison confirms that the choice of terrain data processing method can lead to discrepancies in the modelled inundation if the area of interest lacks high quality data with sufficient land surface detail as input 3 1 2 role of drainage capacity it is important but challenging to include complex pipe networks in a flood model at city scale because of data scarcity and data size qiang et al 2021 yu et al 2016 yu coulthard 2015 particularly for data scarce cities when detailed modelling for drainage flows is not feasible simplified treatment is required as service hole blockages frequently occur the designed drainage capacity may not be achieved in reality coles et al 2017 in view of this concern our study has tested 0 50 80 and 100 of the designed maximum drainage capacity in flood modelling as a comparison fig 4 plots the percentage of the simulated inundation area to the total urban area varying with time it shows that the consideration of pipe drainage with its full design capacity drains floodwaters quickly during and immediately after the rainfall event the simulated inundation area in general increases with more rainfall events if drainage is restricted only a slight decrease occurs during the no rainfall period due to the infiltration fig 4 but pipe drainage plays a crucial role in draining floodwaters away from urban surfaces for simulations with 50 80 and 100 of the drainage capacity and the effects are particularly significant when the rainstorms stop this leads to a recession in urban inundation areas for simulations with drainage flows fig 4 the differences can also be observed from the simulated spatial inundation depths and extent illustrated in fig 5 inundation depths significantly increase due to the accumulated storage of floodwaters on urban surfaces fig 5b c it is seen that both inundation extent and depths are larger under a smaller drainage capacity implying a greater potential flood hazard the results demonstrate that errors on inundation extent and depth can be caused by the common practice of treating drainage flows as a sink term for city scale flood modelling e g yu et al 2016 xing et al 2019 3 2 cross boundary effects on inundation modelling common practice for inundation prediction is to perform the modelling based on the domain of interest upon which both the dem and model meshes are built however unlike natural catchments urban catchments have many surfaces that have been subject to human intervention the city boundary may be different from the corresponding basin boundary which might bring in further discrepancies when modelling inundation based only on the city domain errors may still exist even if modelling is performed on an urban basin that is generated using the available dem data owing to the data bias compared with reality the effects of cross boundary surface water flows i e additional floodwaters may enter or leave the simulated domain are investigated here by performing inundation modelling using the dems of the city centre and of the greater chengdu basin fig 1 fig 6 shows that the overall trends of the percentage of inundation area over urban area and water depths are broadly similar for both scenarios there is a slight difference in the inundation area across the city during the first series of rainfall events 11 and 12 august and the more local simulation which is only based on chengdu city generates a slightly broader inundation area in other words more floodwaters leave the simulated domain when we upscale the modelling from only chengdu city centre to the greater chengdu basin however the differences are not significant during the rainfall events thereafter the direct comparison of inundation area and depths figure s3 shows small differences within 0 1 m with the difference mostly in the northwest of chengdu and around the urban rivers and the domain boundary fig s3a however when assuming zero drainage flows the differences between inundation scenarios of the city centre and the greater basin domain fig s3b are more apparent but still insignificant compared with those caused by input data bias and uncertain parameters thus the simulations for analysis below are conducted using only the chengdu city area for reason of high computational efficiency 3 3 model validation with crowd sourced data one of the challenges for any urban inundation model is obtaining good quality validation data given uncertainties from the multiple data and parameters discussed above in section 3 1 as well as data availability it is not feasible to conduct exact model calibration and validation with the support of the crowd sourced flood spots presented in section 2 2 evaluations of the grid based inundation model are performed first the 232 flood hotpots are successfully collected and identified from social media using crowd sourced approach previously developed by the authors guo et al 2022 a circular buffer area with a radius of 300 m is set to these points considering the uncertainty of the data reported by public source i e an area within 300 m of each hotspot is considered to be flooded second the 232 flood hotspots and their buffer area are then used to compare with the modelled inundation then we calculate the percentage of the coverage points by the simulated inundation to the total 232 flood hotspots and list the results in table s1 it is noted that this is to evaluate the general model performance in the identification of spatial urban inundation fig 7 shows that the simulated maximum inundation area covers most of the crowd sourced flood hotspots despite the effects of model parameters the simulated minimum inundation water depth greater than 2 cm under high infiltration and drainage scenarios still covers over 76 of the reported flood locations fig 7a and table s1 in the case of the low drainage and infiltration there are more flood hotspots 88 8 table s1 falling within the simulated inundation regions for scenarios in between fig 7b the coverage percentage does not differ markedly however the inundation depth and flooded area clearly increase with the smaller drainage and infiltration this implies that inappropriate quantification of drainage and infiltration flows can lead to poor estimations on inundation magnitude and extent overall among all simulation scenarios the model simulated an inundation region in the city that covers 76 89 of the crowd sourced flood points in addition we estimate a range of water depths for each flood hotspot location identified from social media figure s2 by taking objects e g cars persons in the images as a reference of water level the estimated ranges of the water depths are compared with the simulated water depths at the similar locations and the comparison is plotted in fig 8 it shows similar magnitudes in the water depths but the exact values still differ between the modelled and extracted results we consider the results to be acceptable if the depth magnitudes are broadly similar for the modelled results ensemble depths by a variety of parameter setups are plotted it shows that the simulated and estimated water depths agree generally well despite the acceptable discrepancy the test cases show overall agreement between the modelled inundation and the estimated flood hotspots the validation is anticipated not to be perfect with errors because of the identified causes in a variety of limitations in data and model variables it is also manifest that we cannot merely rely on the simulated depths at a single scale as inundation mapping upscaling to diminish the effects of such errors would be appreciated 4 multilevel urban inundation mapping as mentioned above the scarcity of data in many cities particularly in emerging and developing economies creates challenges for urban flood modelling when used for enhancing resilience as the results above demonstrate this data scarcity can lead to levels of uncertainty that make it difficult use the results with confidence in view of this the existing flood mapping approaches using grid based hydrodynamic modelling e g glenis et al 2018 xia et al 2019 sanders and schubert 2019 might lead to large uncertainties in data scarce cities it is even much more challenging to apply data driven models such as ann or cnn e g lin et al 2021 kabir et al 2021 lin et al 2022 to map urban flood hazard given that they are also dependent data availability whilst coarse scale hydrology based models are available for flood mapping e g yamazaki et al 2014 they are more for fluvial flooding with the support of river discharge data validations therefore taking grid based flood modelling as a basis the upscaling approach grid kilometre district proposed here can improve the reliability of the flood mapping in data scarce cities here we have investigated how the results with uncertainties at the finest level based on scarce data can be upscaled to a level where the results are more certain and where despite being at a coarser resolution they are fit for purpose unlike the results at a finer scale as well as reducing resolution we also convert the inundation variables into a hazard mapping specifically a bottom up multi level dynamic hazard mapping over time we investigate whether this can go some way towards reducing the effects of model result variability using the approach proposed in section 2 4 we produce hazard mapping at three spatial levels from the simulated grid level to the upscaled district level the three level hazard mapping for the maximum inundation of the 2020 chengdu flooding is generated and illustrated in fig 9 overall it shows that the increase in spatial scale mitigates the impact of the variabilities in the model outputs making the hazard mapping less sensitive to the uncertainties of modelled results by comparing grid level hazard mapping under low and high infiltration and drainage flows fig 9a b we can see that the variation of the modelled results directly leads to a difference in the gridded level hazard mapping i e there are differences for the hazard classes in the 60 m grids however when upscaling the hazard map from 60 m to kilometre level fig 9c d the difference is diminished it is seen that the high risk cells are roughly similar for both conservative modelling high infiltration and drainage and riskiest modelling low infiltration and drainage and many low and medium hazard cells are well represented by both simulation scenarios this implies that the coarser hazard mapping shows less sensitivity to the uncertainty of data input and model indicating higher reliability moreover a further upscaling of the hazard map to district level fig 9e f can further diminish the variation because the new mapping approach at district level can take the priority of the districts to be flooded into consideration rather than just considering the modelled values of water depth and velocities moreover it is noted that the three level approach can generate dynamic inundation mapping over time i e the grid kilometre district mapping changes with the flooding time thus it has the strength of grid based flood models in tracking the hazard zones dynamically and the outcome is multi layered and more comprehensive but less uncertain once an extreme rainfall is nowcast or recorded e g rainfall radar nowcasting product the proposed approach can convert the predicted rainfall to three level hazard mapping which supports flood management ahead of during or immediately after a flooding first at district level the districts with relative potential of flooding can be identified suggesting the areas in the city that should be given more attention for flood emergency response and rescue and the community can also efficiently communicate the potential severity of a flooding to raise people s awareness second at kilometre and grid levels the hazard mappings can suggest more specific hazard areas for emergency response despite the relative higher variability of the results due to data bias and availability as discussed above specific preparedness could be suggested based on the hazard mapping particularly for critical infrastructures and vulnerable facilities e g utilities power plants hospitals potentially exposure to a flooding 5 conclusions it is common that high quality underlying datasets to support urban inundation modelling are not readily available in many cities across the world this leads to a wide range of variations in urban inundation modelling this study examined this challenge by first exploring how the data or chosen model can lead to modelling discrepancies based on comprehensive modelling using a series of designed scenarios in the 2020 chengdu flooding table 2 to diminish the adverse effects of data scarcity and bias on modelling results this study then developed a three level bottom up approach grid kilometre district for urban inundation mapping based on the integrated dynamic inundation modelling and open source data the main conclusions drawn from the results are the grid based flood hydrodynamic model can simulate detailed inundation depths and velocities dynamically over time however the simulated results demonstrate substantial variations when the supporting data is scarce to be specific the choice of the data processing approach for terrain data can lead to discrepancies in modelled inundation if the area of interest lacks high resolution dem data as flood model input out of all the key model variables drainage flow quantification plays the key role in urban inundation recession thereby influencing the modelled inundation area and floodwater depths significantly however the cross boundary effect is relatively insignificant compared with other uncertain parameter effects it is manifest that urban inundation mapping cannot merely reply on the simulated depths at a single grid scale by a flood hydrodynamic model in data scarce cities crowd sourced flood data flood locations estimated depths can be used to support the verification of a flood model despite inherent errors the data could reasonably suggest where and to what extent flooding occurs which is the most important concern for flood response the three level bottom up approach for urban flood mapping developed in this study diminishes modelling variations due to data bias or availability the method can provide inundation mapping dynamically over time at all grid kilometre and district levels the coarser hazard mapping shows less sensitivity to the uncertainty of data input and model choice indicating relevant higher reliability at a higher spatial scale the multi level method can generate more comprehensive but less uncertain dynamic hazard maps which in turn provides more reliable warnings for emergency response and more efficient resource allocation for flood resilience overall our findings help to improve understanding of how and to what extent input data such as terrain data drainage flow quantification influences grid based urban inundation modelling in view of this an upscaling multilevel model framework can help to reduce the adverse effects so providing more reliable urban inundation mapping the model can support rainstorm induced flood management in data scarce cities with greater confidence credit authorship

2306,reducing nutrient input in aquatic ecosystems has been widely recognized as a way to mitigate eutrophication the paradigm of nutrient limitation by n and p is pervasively accepted without considering the possibility of c limitation however our assumption that c might affect the aquatic biological composition lacks fieldwork support we tested the co limitation of c n p on the growth of submerged macrophytes and phytoplankton in the caohai lake a typical shallow karst lake in southwestern china this study documented the seasonal variations in the concentration and comparative availability of nutrients c n p in addition to physicochemical parameters submerged macrophytes biomass and phytoplankton composition in the lake our results show that dissolved inorganic carbon plays a substantial role in enhancing the primary production of phytoplankton and macrophytes which suggests that primary production can be suppressed not only by p and or n as generally believed but also by c owing to the unique physicochemical characteristics that prevail in typical karst regions additionally submerged macrophytes have been found to inhibit phytoplankton growth further analysis showed that the proportion of cyanobacteria over chlorophyta and bacillariophyta throughout the year was reduced at dissolved carbon dioxide total nitrogen co2 tn ratios 0 2 and dissolved carbon dioxide total phosphorus co2 tp ratios 10 in this study isotopic evidence further indicated that the abundance of cyanobacteria was reduced when co2 30 ¬µmol l in summary the combined results suggest that when controlling n and p co2 fertilization may significantly affect both the growth and composition of phytoplankton communities submerged macrophytes and carbon sequestration in karst surface water ecosystems this implies a new paradigm in the mitigation of cyanobacteria blooms by adding more co2 to aquatic ecosystems with low pco2 during which carbon sequestration may also be enhanced

have permission to share data 1 introduction the concentration of atmospheric co2 which has been dramatically increasing on average to 408 ppm ipcc 2018 myers et al 2014 schimel et al 2000 is exacerbated by human activities resulting in an increase in eutrophication anderson et al 2002 smith 2003 tang et al 2012 since the 1980s evidence of consistent relationships between p and phytoplankton biomass has supported the phosphorus p limitation paradigm edmondson 1970 hecky and kilham 1988 schindler and fee 1973 it is generally believed that a natural mechanism compensates for nitrogen n and carbon c deficiencies in eutrophic lakes schindler 1971 however without an external source p does not participate in the atmospheric gas phase cycle which forms the theoretical basis of this paradigm schindler 1977 smith 1983 in recent decades there has been growing evidence that contradicts this with an emphasis on n limitation or np co limitation particularly in marine ecosystems conley et al 2009 lewis jr and wurtsbaugh 2008 liang et al 2020 smith et al 2016 many lakes are supersaturated with co2 leading to the misconception that the co2 in freshwater systems is sufficient to support the carbon needs of aquatic plants through photosynthesis causing c limitation to be overlooked cole et al 1994 schindler 1971 sobek et al 2005 however inorganic carbon potentially limits photosynthesis in aquatic systems in fact previous understanding of carbon limits was based on investigations of oligo mesotrophic waters cyanobacterial blooms can easily transform a supersaturated lake with co2 into an undersaturated one balmer and downing 2017 the diffusion of co2 is 104 fold lower in water than in air stumm and morgan 1981 zagarese et al 2021 the atmospheric co2 invasion rate

1993 zeng et al 2019 particularly in the karst aquatic ecosystems where alkalinity is high and co2 concentrations is low furthermore co2 can deplete locally and seasonally when aquatic plants grow rapidly zeng et al 2019 or in highly eutrophic lakes where c supply cannot meet demand flynn and raven 2016 talling 2010 low d√©carie et al 2014 previous studies have divided the factors limiting production into rate and yield limiting factors king 1970 schindler 1971 schindler and fee 1973 smith 1983 sterner 2008 whereas c was defined as the rate limiting resource owing to its concentration affected growth rates n and p were defined as yield limiting resources because their concentrations limit the potential maximum biomass the absolute concentrations of these nutrients and their comparative availability c n c p and n p have important implications for limiting aquatic plant growth bao et al 2022 bhavya et al 2017 elser et al 2009 gulis et al 2017 and water quality regulation dodds and oakes 2008 smith 1983 in addition increases in n and p in many modern ecosystems may reduce their restrictions on productivity and correspondingly increase the importance of limited co2 low d√©carie et al 2015 the concept of a biological carbon pump bcp was first proposed in the 1980s by marine scientists who studied the ocean carbon cycle it refers to the transfer of c from the water surface to depth via a series of biological processes including organic matter production consumption transmission deposition and decomposition longhurst and harrison 1989 liu et al 2010 2015 2018 showed that a strong bcp effect also exists in karst surface water ecosystems through photosynthesis of aquatic plants which fixes part of the carbonate weathering dic and forms stable carbon sinks as sedimentary organic carbon the terrestrial bcp effect describes the impact of dic fertilization on the processes andintensity of biomass accumulation the higherthe dic concentration the strongerthe c

and dixit 2009 song et al 2019 the redfield ratio c n p 106 16 1 is considered the average value of marine phytoplankton c n and p ratios but several studies have found that this ratio is not suitable for freshwater systems elser et al 2000 hecky et al 1993 previous studies have shown that nutrient limitations of phytoplankton can be observed in pure species continuous cultures when the nutrient ratios deviate from the redfield ratio howarth 1988 changes in c n p in the water body change the elemental proportions enzyme activities and composition of chemical substances in aquatic plants thereby restricting their growth and affecting the composition of phytoplankton communities hall et al 2005 kilham et al 1997 more importantly phytoplankton taxa exhibit a wide range of capacity for absorbing inorganic c spijkerman et al 2005 some of these are carbon concentrating mechanisms ccms with carbonic anhydrase ca such as in cyanobacteria which can overcome low co2 conditions badger and price 1994 vogt et al 2017 in contrast bacillariophyta and chlorophyta favor higher co2 conditions with their greater c requirements low d√©carie et al 2011 2014 shapiro 1973 previous studies have focused on the standing stock absolute concentrations of nutrients in surface water to relate primary production to hydrophyte abundance kragh and sand jensen 2018 numerous hydrological and biogeochemical processes can change the concentration of nutrient c n and p concentrations in lakes moreover as noted above the nutrient limitation paradigm has been largely based on p and or n studies rather than c nutrient limitation is related to the regular growth rates of phytoplankton populations possible shifts in phytoplankton species composition and the net production of the ecosystem howarth et al 1988 in particular the absolute nutrient concentrations of the water samples measured were those after consumption by hydrophytes i e the result which do not represent the original limiting factors i e the reason moreover the load rate or initial concentration is generally difficult to obtain for natural fresh water ecosystems therefore both the absolute concentration and relative availability of c total n and total p c n c p and n p were used to better understand the co limitation of nutrients on primary production and biological structure composition

al 2015 schindler 2006 shi et al 2017 dense algal blooms are generally caused by toxigenic cyanobacteria catherine et al 2013 monchamp et al 2018 svrcek and smith 2004 thus we suggest that the ratio of cyanobacterial abundance chlorophyta abundance bacillariophyta abundance cya chl bac indicates the degree of water quality deterioration by cyanobacterial bloom in the lake bao et al 2022 when the ratio increases the lake water quality deterioration intensifies and is alleviated when the ratio decreases studies on the effects of seasonal variability on the coupling of c n and p limitation and the response of phytoplankton community composition in karst aquatic ecosystems are scarce therefore this study assessed the seasonal changes in bcp effects with co2 fertilization in a typical shallow karst surface water ecosystem caohai lake with a particular emphasis on the effect of c abundance physicochemical parameters phytoplankton and the main submerged macrophytes samples were collected from 12 sites in the karst lake during the four seasons of 2020 our objectives were to 1 understand the limitations of concentration and stoichiometric elemental ratios c n p on the growth of phytoplankton and submerged macrophytes in water 2 explore the coupling mechanisms and relationships between c n p and the community structures of phytoplankton and submerged macrophytes and 3 reveal the effects of bcp on the mitigation of cyanobacteria blooms and enhancement of carbon sequestration in these waters specifically we sought to verify the hypothesis that carbon sink enhancement and reduction of cyanobacteria blooms by bcp with co2 fertilization in karst water provides new scientific support for this win win situation and a new paradigm of c neutralization and cyanobacteria

bacillariophyta however there were large differences between the sample sites phytoplankton abundance ranged from 557 to 4716 cells ml a seasonal peak was observed at site c4 in summer 4716 cells ml and autumn 4264 cells ml these peaks were attributed mainly to chlorophyta coelastrum chlamydomonas scenedesmus and selenastrum bibraianum and bacillariophyta cyclotella melosira and synedra in contrast the lowest average annual abundance was observed at site c7 932 464 cells ml which had a relatively high submerged macrophytes dry weight figs 4 and 5 cyanobacteria developed best in summer

chara braunii and myriophyllum spicatum was determined by measuring the samples from the 12 sites during winter and summer we defined winter as the dormant season and summer as the growing season fig

increased by approximately 38 from the dormant season 33 2 10 9 g m2 to the growing season 52 5 30 8 g m2 in the growing season the variability of dry weight between the sample sites was relatively high with the lowest average dry weight being observed at c4 9 2 2 8 g m2 and the highest at c11 116 7 17 0 g m2 the dry weight of submerged macrophytes were the lowest at sites c1 to c4 which were close to urban and cultivated lands fig 5 at the highest external load of nutrients site c4 macrophyte cover was exceptionally low with large unvegetated areas and a high chl a concentration 3 3 effects of nutrient concentrations and ratios on phytoplankton and submerged macrophytes the relationships between chl a and c n or p concentrations were examined the results are shown in fig s1 there were positive correlations between chl a and dissolved co2 during all seasons except winter spring r 2 0 76 p 0 01 summer r 2 0 72 p 0 01 autumn r 2 0 74 p 0 01 fig s1b meanwhile the correlations between chl a and tn during spring and summer were positive fig s1c the positive correlations between chl a and tp during the four seasons are shown in fig s1d these results indicate that c n and p affect the primary productivity of phytoplankton in the lakes to further investigate the co limitation of c n p and the type of nutrients that play a significant role in phytoplankton primary productivity we analyzed the correlation between chl a and nutrient ratio the correlation between chl a and nutrients c n c p and n p ratios was largely influenced by season fig 6 there was a significant positive linear correlation between chl a concentrations and dic c to tn ratios during summer r2 0 72 p 0 001 and autumn r2 0 48 p 0 01 but a negative linear correlation during spring r2 0 12 p 0 01 fig 6a in contrast chl a did not show any positive or negative correlation with the ratios of dic c to tp in these three seasons r2 0 01 p 0 86 r2 0 06 p 0 43 and r2 0 19 p 0 15 respectively fig 6b our study also revealed a significant positive linear relationship between co2 tn and chl a in the spring summer and autumn datasets r2 0 58 p 0 01 r2 0 71 p 0 001 and r2 0 70 p 0 001 respectively fig 6d co2 tp displayed the same trend but with a low r2 fig 6e however co2 tn and co2 tp had little or no negative effect on chl a concentration in winter r2 0 02 p 0 68 r2 0 24 p 0 10 when pco2 was over 400 Œºatm at most sites our research classifies cyanobacteria cya as harmful algae and chlorophyta chl and bacillariophyta bac as harmless algae and compared their ratios cya chl bac with the nutrient concentrations during the different seasons fig s2 the results revealed a significant negative correlation between the co2 and cya chl bac ratios during summer and autumn r2 0 55 p 0 01 and r2 0 33 p 0 05 fig s2a indicating that co2 may influence cyanobacteria blooms during the rapid phytoplankton growth period in karst ecosystems there was almost no correlation between tn tp and cya chl bac ratios throughoutthe year p 0 05 fig s2a and 2b furthermore we analyzed the relationship between phytoplankton communities and nutrient molar ratios fig 7 the increase in the co2 tn and co2 tp ratios is attributed to a decrease in the cya chl bac ratios especially in summer r2 0 57 p 0 01 and r2 0 49 p 0 01 respectively and winter r2 0 51 p 0 01 and r2 0 37 p 0 05 respectively there was little or no seasonal correlation between cya chl bac and the tn tp ratio except in summer which yielded a significant positive relationship r2 0 54 p 0 01 fig 7c the correlations between the submerged macrophytes dry weight variables and nutrient ratios are shown in fig 8 the dic c tn ratio did not affect submerged macrophytes dry weight p 0 05 fig 8a however there was a significant positive linear relationship between the submerged macrophytes dry weight dic c tp ratio in both seasons especially during the growing season r2 0 79 p 0 001 fig 8b 4 discussion 4 1 limitation of elemental stoichiometric ratios c n p on phytoplankton and submerged macrophyte growth several studies on karst shallow water ecosystems have focused on n or p camacho et al 2003 elser et al 2009 however our investigation of the nutrient concentrations and stoichiometric ratios of the principal elements emphasized the role of c reflecting the unique physicochemical characteristics of carbonate karst surface water ecosystems high ph but low co2 as noted productivity limits are determined by rate limiting resources such as c or the yield limiting resources such as p and n low d√©carie et al 2014 riebesell et al 1993 the ph of most of the caohai sampling sites reached 8 0 n 34 during the growing season spring summer and autumn indicating that dissolved co2 was 1 dic riebesell et al 1993 zeng et al 2019 this carbon limitation may occur in aquatic ecosystems when tn and tp are relatively abundant bogard et al 2017 hammer et al 2019 verspagen et al 2014 zagarese et al 2021 at least locally or over a short timescale e g lakes or reservoirs schindler and fee 1973 mitigating eutrophication in already eutrophic lakes by controlling n and p concentrations may not be effective in the short term huser et al 2016 there are many forms of c in water bodies riebesell et al 1993 and dissolved co2 which is used preferentially by most plants bao et al 2022 hillebrand et al 1999 low d√©carie et al 2014 riebesell et al 2007 schindler 1977 zeng et al 2019 is extremely scarce in karst water bodies during the growing season surface water co2 tn and co2 tp molar ratios ranged from 0 01 to 1 19 and 0 44 to 11 49 over the four seasons fig 6d and e far below the redfield ratio redfield et al 1963 we found a significant effect of co2 tn and co2 tp on chl a fig 6d and e indicating that c n and p co limited primary productivity in these karst shallow surface waters the tn to tp ratio is the most commonly used index for describing the nutrient limitations of phytoplankton phillips et al 2008 prairie et al 1989 a decreasing trend in tn tp with chl a was observed in three of the seasonal datasets fig 6c which is consistent with previous research dove and chapra 2015 downing and mccauley 1992 liang et al 2020 yan et al 2016 this study confirms that inorganic c promotes an increase in primary production chl a in shallow karst lakes andrade et al 2021 hamdan et al 2018 jansson et al 2012 schippers et al 2004 indicating a higher capacity for carbon sequestration anderson et al 2014 although several studies have suggested that temperature increases the mineralization of organic carbon gudasz et al 2010 the deposition rate of organic carbon i e the high deposition flux could offset the mineralization effect caused by temperature which has been demonstrated in numerous studies such as those in fuxian lake china he et al 2020 and global lakes cole et al 2007 tranvik et al 2009 an important finding was that the nutrient limitation of phytoplankton in the karst surface water ecosystem was in the order c p n expect in winter therefore it has been suggested that carbon should be emphasized as a rate limiting factor low d√©carie et al 2014 in mesotrophic and eutrophic freshwater vallentyne 1974 zeng et al 2019 light limitations have been emphasized in other studies havens et al 2003 huisman et al 2002 karlsson et al 2009 lehman et al 1975 but most have been in oligotrophic lakes which are light limited by definition karlsson et al 2009 caohai lake is a mesotrophic to eutrophic water body where light limitation is not a factor nutrient limitation was detected within individual seasons when light penetration was similar at all sampling sites both carbon dioxide co2 and bicarbonate hco3 are available for use by submerged macrophytes maberly and gontero 2017 pedersen et al 2013 we considered dic to be of prime importance in macrophyte growth because of the presence of submerged macrophyte species in the study area pagano and titus 2007 the increase in submerged macrophytes dry weight by dic c tp was mentioned above indicating that relatively high dic concentrations promoted growth nutrient limitation was in the order of c p and n p thus we showed that the growth of both phytoplankton and submerged macrophytes was limited by the availability of inorganic c during the study period similar trends were observed at the shawan karst test site sw china zeng et al 2019 bao et al 2022 showing carbon limitation on aquatic photosynthesis thus we suggest that c limitation in small karst water bodies such as lakes and reservoirs should be emphasized in further research and the comparative availability of nutrients c n c p and n p and available c for aquatic plants should also be considered 4 2 coupling relationships and mechanisms between c n p and community structures of the phytoplankton and submerged macrophytes we have previously reported that a low ratio of cya chl bac indicated that the lake cyanobacteria blooms were alleviated cyanobacteria such as microcystis aeruginosa and cylindrospermopsis raciborskii are the primary groups responsible for algal blooms during eutrophication paerl 2008 after growth and death some cyanobacteria release toxic substances into host water bodies which are detrimental to aquatic ecosystems and human health huisman et al 2018 ross et al 2006 thus even if blooms occur we hope that they are diatom or green algae blooms rather than cyanobacteria blooms our study revealed a significant negative relationship between cya chl bac for co2 tn and co2 tp respectively fig 7a and b as expected cyanobacteria tended to grow best at low co2 tn and co2 tp ratios whereas chlorophyta and bacillariophyta preferred high co2 tn and co2 tp ratios particularly when the ratios were higher than 0 2 and 10 cyanobacteria have been observed to bloom when the excess of n p is low downing et al 2001 smith 1983 which is consistent with the results in caohai lake in addition the use of hco3 by different phytoplankton can result in changes in Œ¥13cdic and Œ¥13cpoc in the euphotic layer cyanobacteria have a higher capacity to utilize hco3 which allows them to thrive more than chlorophyta and bacillariophyta when Œ¥13c is positive xiao et al 2021 there was a significant negative correlation between Œ¥13cdic Œ¥13cpoc and the abundance of chlorophyta bacillariophyta fig 9 a when co2 aq concentrations were lower than 30 ¬µmol l the dominant species shifted from chlorophyta and bacillariophyta to cyanobacteria fig 9b thus an appropriate increase in co2 aq concentrations can significantly enhance photosynthetic carbon sequestration and reduce the proportion of cyanobacteria when controlling n and p seasonal samples from all 12 sites were used in a redundancy analysis rda of the effects of environmental factors co2 tn co2 tp dic tn dic tp tn tp and temperature on phytoplankton communities cyanobacterial abundance chlorophyta abundance and bacillariophyta abundance chl a and the submerged macrophytes dry weight rda confirmed that the response of cyanobacteria to nutrients differs from that of chlorophyta and bacillariophyta in the growing season chlorophyta and bacillariophyta abundance increased when the c n and c p ratios increased whereas the cyanobacteria mass decreased in the spring summer and autumn samples site c4 differed from the other sampling sites the sample taken near the wharf had the highest pollution level of all the caohai lake samples as indicated by high chl a c n and c p values the analysis revealed that cyanobacteria favored low co2 conditions whereas chlorophyta and bacillariophyta favored higher co2 conditions previous studies have indicated that p and n concentrations dominate phytoplankton growth and strongly influence community composition and structure guildford and hecky 2000 kangur et al 2003 wejnerowski et al 2018 however the possible role of abundant c is ignored the principal phytoplankton taxa differ in their ability to fix inorganic c and adjust their growth response to elevated co2 concentrations falkowski and raven 2013 hare et al 2007 verschoor et al 2013 chlorophyta have higher c n p ratios 375 23 1 than cyanobacteria 160 22 1 as shown by king 1970 that is chlorophyta requires more carbon than cyanobacteria to grow shapiro 1973 the strongest cyanobacteria blooms tend to occur in water bodies with low co2 concentrations owing to the ccms that exploit both co2 and hco3 for carbonic anhydrase photosynthesis on cell surfaces aizawa and miyachi 1986 burnap et al 2015 price et al 1998 reinfelder 2011 shapiro 1990 van dam et al 2018 phytoplankton ccm is species specific raven et al 2020 chlorophyta and bacillariophyta favor higher co2 concentrations with low ccms and ribulose 1 5 bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase rubisco specificity low d√©carie et al 2011 2015 tortell et al 2002 it has been demonstrated that cyanobacteria has a higher rubisco maximum carboxylation rate than chlorophyta and bacillariophyta savir et al 2010 young et al 2016 consequently the limited availability of co2 may lead phytoplankton to shift from being dominated by chlorophyta and bacillariophyta which indicate relatively good water quality to being dominated by cyanobacteria which are associated with bad water quality thus forcing phytoplankton to use hco3 as an inorganic c source riebesell 2004 shi et al 2017 this finding may explain the increase in chlorophyta and bacillariophyta with increasing co2 concentrations reinfelder 2011 low d√©carie et al 2015 and the competitive advantages of low concentrations of co2 for the growth of cyanobacteria in summary cyanobacteria were more competitive than the other two phyla under low co2 conditions in addition changes in the concentrations of inorganic c and nutrients in the water significantly affect the growth of submerged plants d√ºlger et al 2017 the relationship between dic tp tn tp fig 8 and submerged macrophytes dry weight in caohai lake revealed that more c or n promoted macrophytes growth this finding is consistent with that of o hare et al 2010 who found that macrophyte biomass increased with an increase in the amount of carbon present as hco3 in 14 rivers across the uk improving the water quality and promoting the carbon sink more p inhibited the growth of submerged macrophytes which was not conducive to good water quality thus c n p ratios play a significant role in regulating phytoplankton and the biological structure composition of the submerged macrophyte biomass finally the negative correlation between submerged macrophytes dry weight and chl a observed in figs 5 and 10 demonstrates that submerged macrophytes can inhibit phytoplankton growth which can occur directly via allelopathy or indirectly via competition for nutrients dahlgren and kautsky 2004 k√∂rner and nicklisch 2002 vanderstukken et al 2011 this phenomenon offers another way to mitigate cyanobacteria bloomsin freshwater environments 4 3 possibilities and implications of mitigating cyanobacteria blooms and enhancing carbon sequestration by the bcp with co2 fertilization the below

sequestration of atmospheric co2 1 ca 2 2 hco 3 photos caco 3 x co 2 h 2 o 1 x ch 2 o o 2 the bcp effect refers to photosynthesis caused by dic concentration dic fertilization effect which increases the aquatic biomass and enhances its carbon sequestration liu et al 2010 2018 the presence of inorganic c promotes an increase in primary production chl a and submerged macrophyte biomass in shallow karst lakes brothers et al 2013 hamdan et al 2018 jansson et al 2012 schippers et al 2004 vogt et al 2017 as verified in this study our analysis of the elemental ratios co2 tn co2 tp and tn tp and phytoplankton relationships revealed that the composition of phytoplankton communities varied as a function of co2 concentrations and ratios which is consistent with our hypothesis and the predictions of previous theoretical and experimental studies low d√©carie et al 2011 2014 2015 shi et al 2016 wolfe and siver 2013 efforts to decrease n and or p inputs into aquatic ecosystems to control eutrophication often result in reduced agricultural yields globally hossain and singh 2000 lu and tian 2017 our observations suggest that cyanobacteria blooms can be mitigated by regulating phytoplankton composition by injecting co2 into water bao et al 2022 which has no impact on agricultural productivity our findings in caohai lake show that c n and p co limit primary production and regulate the biological structure composition of phytoplankton and submerged macrophytes by the bcp effect which has significant implications for cyanobacteria blooms control and carbon neutralization a win win situation 5 conclusions in this study we investigated seasonal variations in the absolute and relative availability of nutrient concentrations c n c p and n p physicochemical parameters submerged macrophyte biomass and phytoplankton composition in caohai lake a typical karst lake in southwest china our results indicate that dissolved inorganic carbon promotes the primary production of phytoplankton chl a and macrophyte biomass therefore primary production may be limited not only by p and or n but also by c as a consequence of the distinct water chemistry characteristics of carbonate karst regions furthermore submerged macrophytes that inhibited phytoplankton growth were identified in this lake the increase in c n and c p ratios led to a reduction in the proportion of cyanobacteria over chlorophyta and bacillariophyta cya chl bac throughout the year particularly when the co2 tn and co2 tp ratios were higher than 0 2 and 10 respectively based on isotopic evidence the abundance of cyanobacteria was reduced by co2 fertilization especially when the co2 exceeded 30 ¬µmol l our study revealed that bcp on co2 fertilization in karst surface water ecosystems have synergistic effects on biological structure composition and carbon sequestration potentially a win win situation in contrast to the traditional approach of reducing n and or p we suggest that this is a possible step towards alleviating cyanobacteria blooms by adding emitted industrial co2 to water bodies after they are thoroughly treated from a variety of pollutants with a simple low cost and passive option in low pco2 aquatic ecosystems however further controlled experiments are needed to examine the effects of artificial addition of co2 on biological composition and carbon sequestration

2306,reducing nutrient input in aquatic ecosystems has been widely recognized as a way to mitigate eutrophication the paradigm of nutrient limitation by n and p is pervasively accepted without considering the possibility of c limitation however our assumption that c might affect the aquatic biological composition lacks fieldwork support we tested the co limitation of c n p on the growth of submerged macrophytes and phytoplankton in the caohai lake a typical shallow karst lake in southwestern china this study documented the seasonal variations in the concentration and comparative availability of nutrients c n p in addition to physicochemical parameters submerged macrophytes biomass and phytoplankton composition in the lake our results show that dissolved inorganic carbon plays a substantial role in enhancing the primary production of phytoplankton and macrophytes which suggests that primary production can be suppressed not only by p and or n as generally believed but also by c owing to the unique physicochemical characteristics that prevail in typical karst regions additionally submerged macrophytes have been found to inhibit phytoplankton growth further analysis showed that the proportion of cyanobacteria over chlorophyta and bacillariophyta throughout the year was reduced at dissolved carbon dioxide total nitrogen co2 tn ratios 0 2 and dissolved carbon dioxide total phosphorus co2 tp ratios 10 in this study isotopic evidence further indicated that the abundance of cyanobacteria was reduced when co2 30 ¬µmol l in summary the combined results suggest that when controlling n and p co2 fertilization may significantly affect both the growth and composition of phytoplankton communities submerged macrophytes and carbon sequestration in karst surface water ecosystems this implies a new paradigm in the mitigation of cyanobacteria blooms by adding more co2 to aquatic ecosystems with low pco2 during which carbon sequestration may also be enhanced

exacerbated by human activities resulting in an increase in eutrophication anderson et al 2002 smith 2003 tang et al 2012 since the 1980s evidence of consistent relationships between p and phytoplankton biomass has supported the phosphorus p limitation paradigm edmondson 1970 hecky and kilham 1988 schindler and fee 1973 it is generally believed that a natural mechanism compensates for nitrogen n and carbon c deficiencies in eutrophic lakes schindler 1971 however without an external source p does not participate in the atmospheric gas phase cycle which forms the theoretical basis of this paradigm schindler 1977 smith 1983 in recent decades there has been growing evidence that contradicts this with an emphasis on n limitation or np co limitation particularly in marine ecosystems conley et al 2009 lewis jr and wurtsbaugh 2008 liang et al 2020 smith et al 2016 many lakes are supersaturated with co2 leading to the misconception that the co2 in freshwater systems is sufficient to support the carbon needs of aquatic plants through photosynthesis causing c limitation to be overlooked cole et al 1994 schindler 1971 sobek et al 2005 however inorganic carbon potentially limits photosynthesis in aquatic systems in fact previous understanding of carbon limits was based on investigations of oligo mesotrophic waters cyanobacterial blooms can easily transform a supersaturated lake with co2 into an undersaturated one balmer and downing 2017 the diffusion of co2 is 104 fold lower in water than in air stumm and morgan 1981 zagarese et al 2021 the atmospheric co2 invasion rate

1993 zeng et al 2019 particularly in the karst aquatic ecosystems where alkalinity is high and co2 concentrations is low furthermore co2 can deplete locally and seasonally when aquatic plants grow rapidly zeng et al 2019 or in highly eutrophic lakes where c supply cannot meet demand flynn and raven 2016 talling 2010 low d√©carie et al 2014 previous studies have divided the factors limiting production into rate and yield limiting factors king 1970 schindler 1971 schindler and fee 1973 smith 1983 sterner 2008 whereas c was defined as the rate limiting resource owing to its concentration affected growth rates n and p were defined as yield limiting resources because their concentrations limit the potential maximum biomass the absolute concentrations of these nutrients and their comparative availability c n c p and n p have important implications for limiting aquatic plant growth bao et al 2022 bhavya et al 2017 elser et al 2009 gulis et al 2017 and water quality regulation dodds and oakes 2008 smith 1983 in addition increases in n and p in many modern ecosystems may reduce their restrictions on productivity and correspondingly increase the importance of limited co2 low d√©carie et al 2015 the concept of a biological carbon pump bcp was first proposed in the 1980s by marine scientists who studied the ocean carbon cycle it refers to the transfer of c from the water surface to depth via a series of biological processes including organic matter production consumption transmission deposition and decomposition longhurst and harrison 1989 liu et al 2010 2015 2018 showed that a strong bcp effect also exists in karst surface water ecosystems through photosynthesis of aquatic plants which fixes part of the carbonate weathering dic and forms stable carbon sinks as sedimentary organic carbon the terrestrial bcp effect describes the impact of dic fertilization on the processes andintensity of biomass accumulation the higherthe dic concentration the strongerthe c stabilization and formation of csinks liu et al 2010 2018 furthermore it has been proven that macrophytes the principal bcp effect product can improve water quality and alleviate eutrophication dhote and dixit 2009 song et al 2019 the redfield ratio c n p 106 16 1 is considered the average value of marine phytoplankton c n and p ratios but several studies have found that this ratio is not suitable for freshwater systems elser et al 2000 hecky et al 1993 previous studies have shown that nutrient limitations of phytoplankton can be observed in pure species continuous cultures when the nutrient ratios deviate from the redfield ratio howarth 1988 changes in c n p in the water body change the elemental proportions enzyme activities and composition of chemical substances in aquatic plants thereby restricting their growth and affecting the composition of phytoplankton communities hall et al 2005 kilham et al 1997 more importantly phytoplankton taxa exhibit a wide range of capacity for absorbing inorganic c spijkerman et al 2005 some of these are carbon concentrating mechanisms ccms with carbonic anhydrase ca such as in cyanobacteria which can overcome low co2 conditions badger and price 1994 vogt et al 2017 in contrast bacillariophyta and chlorophyta favor higher co2 conditions with their greater c requirements low d√©carie et al 2011 2014 shapiro 1973 previous studies have focused on the standing stock absolute concentrations of nutrients in surface water to relate primary production to hydrophyte abundance kragh and sand jensen 2018 numerous hydrological and biogeochemical processes can change the concentration of nutrient c n and p concentrations in lakes moreover as noted above the nutrient limitation paradigm has been largely based on p and or n studies rather than c nutrient limitation is related to the regular growth rates of phytoplankton populations possible shifts in phytoplankton species composition and the net production of the ecosystem howarth et al 1988 in particular the absolute nutrient concentrations of the water samples measured were those after consumption by hydrophytes i e the result which do not represent the original limiting factors i e the reason moreover the load rate or initial concentration is generally difficult to obtain for natural fresh water ecosystems therefore both the absolute concentration and relative availability of c total n and total p c n c p and n p were used to better understand the co limitation of nutrients on primary production and biological structure composition

al 2015 schindler 2006 shi et al 2017 dense algal blooms are generally caused by toxigenic cyanobacteria catherine et al 2013 monchamp et al 2018 svrcek and smith 2004 thus we suggest that the ratio of cyanobacterial abundance chlorophyta abundance bacillariophyta abundance cya chl bac indicates the degree of water quality deterioration by cyanobacterial bloom in the lake bao et al 2022 when the ratio increases the lake water quality deterioration intensifies and is alleviated when the ratio decreases studies on the effects of seasonal variability on the coupling of c n and p limitation and the response of phytoplankton community composition in karst aquatic ecosystems are scarce therefore this study assessed the seasonal changes in bcp effects with co2 fertilization in a typical shallow karst surface water ecosystem caohai lake with a particular emphasis on the effect of c abundance physicochemical parameters phytoplankton and the main submerged macrophytes samples were collected from 12 sites in the karst lake during the four seasons of 2020 our objectives were to 1 understand the limitations of concentration and stoichiometric elemental ratios c n p on the growth of phytoplankton and submerged macrophytes in water 2 explore the coupling mechanisms and relationships between c n p and the community structures of phytoplankton and submerged macrophytes and 3 reveal the effects of bcp on the mitigation of cyanobacteria blooms and enhancement of carbon sequestration in these waters specifically we sought to verify the hypothesis that carbon sink enhancement and reduction of cyanobacteria blooms by bcp with co2 fertilization in karst water provides new scientific support for this win win situation and a new paradigm of c neutralization and cyanobacteria

of phytoplankton and submerged macrophytes phytoplankton samples for the qualitative study were collected directly from the water using a phytoplankton net mesh size 0 064 mm in an shape for at least ten minutes and then preserved in 50 ml centrifuge tubes fixed with a formaldehyde solution 4 surface water samples 1 5 l were concentrated to 30 ml using lugol iodine for quantitative analysis to identify genera all subsamples were inspected using an inverted microscope at 400 magnification hillebrand et al 1999 for analysis the genera were aggregated at the levels of cyanobacteria chlorophyta bacillariophyta pyrrophyta englenophyta and chrysphyta because these six groups made up most of the community biomass the submerged macrophytes were collected using a pettersen grab bucket port area 0 19 m2 along one or two quadrats of 1 m2 each all the macrophytes were collected within 0 19 m2 which was repeated three to six times within the transect to reduce the error caused by uneven growth kept in the dark in a cooling box in the field and frozen for 24 h to avoid deterioration all samples were cleaned with ultrapure water and placed in a drying oven 60 until they reached constant weight dry weight at least 48 h the dry weight of the plants was used as a proxy for the macrophytes biomass 2 4 statistical analysis the mean and standard deviation were used to calculate the average

chl a concentration peaked from late spring to summer but it was likely that the absolute chl a concentration was also high during autumn being compensated by higher grazing pressures and larger submerged plants biomass sampling site c4 had the highest chl a 20 58 26 29 Œºg l and tp 0 071 0 154 mg l during all seasons fig 3 and table s1 Œ¥13cdic ranged from 7 20 to 1 28 with an average of 3

composition and submerged macrophytes dry weight in the study lake phytoplankton composition and abundance are shown in fig 4 and table s2 for this analysis genera were aggregated at the cyanobacteria chlorophyta bacillariophyta pyrrophyta euglenophyta and chrysophyta levels as these six groups constituted the majority of the biomass the community was dominated by cyanobacteria chlorophyta and bacillariophyta however there were large differences between the sample sites phytoplankton abundance ranged from 557 to 4716 cells ml a seasonal peak was observed at site c4 in summer 4716 cells ml and autumn 4264 cells ml these peaks were attributed mainly to chlorophyta coelastrum chlamydomonas scenedesmus and selenastrum bibraianum and bacillariophyta cyclotella melosira and synedra in contrast the lowest average annual abundance was observed at site c7 932 464 cells ml which had a relatively high submerged macrophytes dry weight figs 4 and 5 cyanobacteria developed best in summer with the most common taxa being microcystis ichthyoblabe pseudanabaena merismopedia sp and gomphosphaeria lacustris furthermore the concentration of chl a was consistent with phytoplankton abundance throughout the year r 0 79 p 0 001 indicating that both parameters represented the primary production of phytoplankton very well the dry weight of the submerged macrophytes mainly potamogeton lucens chara braunii and myriophyllum spicatum was determined by measuring the samples from the 12 sites during winter and summer we defined winter as the dormant season and summer as the growing season fig 5 the submerged macrophytes dry weight ranged from 15 05 to 53 94 g m2 in the dormant season and from 9 22 to 116 73 g m2 in the growing season n 12 the average submerged macrophytes dry weight increased by approximately 38 from the dormant season 33 2 10 9 g m2 to the growing season 52 5 30 8 g m2 in the growing season the variability of dry weight between the sample sites was relatively high with the lowest average dry weight being observed at c4 9 2 2 8 g m2 and the highest at c11 116 7 17 0 g m2 the dry weight of submerged macrophytes were the lowest at sites c1 to c4 which were close to urban and cultivated lands fig 5 at the highest external load of nutrients site c4 macrophyte cover was exceptionally low with large unvegetated areas and a high chl a concentration 3 3 effects of nutrient concentrations and ratios on phytoplankton and submerged macrophytes the relationships between chl a and c n or p concentrations were examined the results are shown in fig s1 there were positive correlations between chl a and dissolved co2 during all seasons except winter spring r 2 0 76 p 0 01 summer r 2 0 72 p 0 01 autumn r 2 0 74 p 0 01 fig s1b meanwhile the correlations between chl a and tn during spring and summer were positive fig s1c the positive correlations between chl a and tp during the four seasons are shown in fig s1d these results indicate that c n and p affect the primary productivity of phytoplankton in the lakes to further investigate the co limitation of c n p and the type of nutrients that play a significant role in phytoplankton primary productivity we analyzed the correlation between chl a and nutrient ratio the correlation between chl a and nutrients c n c p and n p ratios was largely influenced by season fig 6 there was a significant positive linear correlation between chl a concentrations and dic c to tn ratios during summer r2 0 72 p 0 001 and autumn r2 0 48 p 0 01 but a negative linear correlation during spring r2 0 12 p 0 01 fig 6a in contrast chl a did not show any positive or negative correlation with the ratios of dic c to tp in these three seasons r2 0 01 p 0 86 r2 0 06 p 0 43 and r2 0 19 p 0 15 respectively fig 6b our study also revealed a significant positive linear relationship between co2 tn and chl a in the spring summer and autumn datasets r2 0 58 p 0 01 r2 0 71 p 0 001 and r2 0 70 p 0 001 respectively fig 6d co2 tp displayed the same trend but with a low r2 fig 6e however co2 tn and co2 tp had little or no negative effect on chl a concentration in winter r2 0 02 p 0 68 r2 0 24 p 0 10 when pco2 was over 400 Œºatm at most sites our research classifies cyanobacteria cya as harmful algae and chlorophyta chl and bacillariophyta bac as harmless algae and compared their ratios cya chl bac with the nutrient concentrations during the different seasons fig s2 the results revealed a significant negative correlation between the co2 and cya chl bac ratios during summer and autumn r2 0 55 p 0 01 and r2 0 33 p 0 05 fig s2a indicating that co2 may influence cyanobacteria blooms during the rapid phytoplankton growth period in karst ecosystems there was almost no correlation between tn tp and cya chl bac ratios throughoutthe year p 0 05 fig s2a and 2b furthermore we analyzed the relationship between phytoplankton communities and nutrient molar ratios fig 7 the increase in the co2 tn and co2 tp ratios is attributed to a decrease in the cya chl bac ratios especially in summer r2 0 57 p 0 01 and r2 0 49 p 0 01 respectively and winter r2 0 51 p 0 01 and r2 0 37 p 0 05 respectively there was little or no seasonal correlation between cya chl bac and the tn tp ratio except in summer which yielded a significant positive relationship r2 0 54 p 0 01 fig 7c the correlations between the submerged macrophytes dry weight variables and nutrient ratios are shown in fig 8 the dic c tn ratio did not affect submerged macrophytes dry weight p 0 05 fig 8a however there was a significant positive linear relationship between the submerged macrophytes dry weight dic c tp ratio in both seasons especially during the growing season r2 0 79 p 0 001 fig 8b 4 discussion 4 1 limitation of elemental stoichiometric ratios c n p on phytoplankton and submerged macrophyte growth several studies on karst shallow water ecosystems have focused on n or p camacho et al 2003 elser et al 2009 however our investigation of the nutrient concentrations and stoichiometric ratios of the principal elements emphasized the role of c reflecting the unique physicochemical characteristics of carbonate karst surface water ecosystems high ph but low co2 as noted productivity limits are determined by rate limiting resources such as c or the yield limiting resources such as p and n low d√©carie et al 2014 riebesell et al 1993 the ph of most of the caohai sampling sites reached 8 0 n 34 during the growing season spring summer and autumn indicating that dissolved co2 was 1 dic riebesell et al 1993 zeng et al 2019 this carbon limitation may occur in aquatic ecosystems when tn and tp are relatively abundant bogard et al 2017 hammer et al 2019 verspagen et al 2014 zagarese et al 2021 at least locally or over a short timescale e g lakes or reservoirs schindler and fee 1973 mitigating eutrophication in already eutrophic lakes by controlling n and p concentrations may not be effective in the short term huser et al 2016 there are many forms of c in water bodies riebesell et al 1993 and dissolved co2 which is used preferentially by most plants bao et al 2022 hillebrand et al 1999 low d√©carie et al 2014 riebesell et al 2007 schindler 1977 zeng et al 2019 is extremely scarce in karst water bodies during the growing season surface water co2 tn and co2 tp molar ratios ranged from 0 01 to 1 19 and 0 44 to 11 49 over the four seasons fig 6d and e far below the redfield ratio redfield et al 1963 we found a significant effect of co2 tn and co2 tp on chl a fig 6d and e indicating that c n and p co limited primary productivity in these karst shallow surface waters the tn to tp ratio is the most commonly used index for describing the nutrient limitations of phytoplankton phillips et al 2008 prairie et al 1989 a decreasing trend in tn tp with chl a was observed in three of the seasonal datasets fig 6c which is consistent with previous research dove and chapra 2015 downing and mccauley 1992 liang et al 2020 yan et al 2016 this study confirms that inorganic c promotes an increase in primary production chl a in shallow karst lakes andrade et al 2021 hamdan et al 2018 jansson et al 2012 schippers et al 2004 indicating a higher capacity for carbon sequestration anderson et al 2014 although several studies have suggested that temperature increases the mineralization of organic carbon gudasz et al 2010 the deposition rate of organic carbon i e the high deposition flux could offset the mineralization effect caused by temperature which has been demonstrated in numerous studies such as those in fuxian lake china he et al 2020 and global lakes cole et al 2007 tranvik et al 2009 an important finding was that the nutrient limitation of phytoplankton in the karst surface water ecosystem was in the order c p n expect in winter therefore it has been suggested that carbon should be emphasized as a rate limiting factor low d√©carie et al 2014 in mesotrophic and eutrophic freshwater vallentyne 1974 zeng et al 2019 light limitations have been emphasized in other studies havens et al 2003 huisman et al 2002 karlsson et al 2009 lehman et al 1975 but most have been in oligotrophic lakes which are light limited by definition karlsson et al 2009 caohai lake is a mesotrophic to eutrophic water body where light limitation is not a factor nutrient limitation was detected within individual seasons when light penetration was similar at all sampling sites both carbon dioxide co2 and bicarbonate hco3 are available for use by submerged macrophytes maberly and gontero 2017 pedersen et al 2013 we considered dic to be of prime importance in macrophyte growth because of the presence of submerged macrophyte species in the study area pagano and titus 2007 the increase in submerged macrophytes dry weight by dic c tp was mentioned above indicating that relatively high dic concentrations promoted growth nutrient limitation was in the order of c p and n p thus we showed that the growth of both phytoplankton and submerged macrophytes was limited by the availability of inorganic c during the study period similar trends were observed at the shawan karst test site sw china zeng et al 2019 bao et al 2022 showing carbon limitation on aquatic photosynthesis thus we suggest that c limitation in small karst water bodies such as lakes and reservoirs should be emphasized in further research and the comparative availability of nutrients c n c p and n p and available c for aquatic plants should also be considered 4 2 coupling relationships and mechanisms between c n p and community structures of the phytoplankton and submerged macrophytes we have previously reported that a low ratio of cya chl bac indicated that the lake cyanobacteria blooms were alleviated cyanobacteria such as microcystis aeruginosa and cylindrospermopsis raciborskii are the primary groups responsible for algal blooms during eutrophication paerl 2008 after growth and death some cyanobacteria release toxic substances into host water bodies which are detrimental to aquatic ecosystems and human health huisman et al 2018 ross et al 2006 thus even if blooms occur we hope that they are diatom or green algae blooms rather than cyanobacteria blooms our study revealed a significant negative relationship between cya chl bac for co2 tn and co2 tp respectively fig 7a and b as expected cyanobacteria tended to grow best at low co2 tn and co2 tp ratios whereas chlorophyta and bacillariophyta preferred high co2 tn and co2 tp ratios particularly when the ratios were higher than 0 2 and 10 cyanobacteria have been observed to bloom when the excess of n p is low downing et al 2001 smith 1983 which is consistent with the results in caohai lake in addition the use of hco3 by different phytoplankton can result in changes in Œ¥13cdic and Œ¥13cpoc in the euphotic layer cyanobacteria have a higher capacity to utilize hco3 which allows them to thrive more than chlorophyta and bacillariophyta when Œ¥13c is positive xiao et al 2021 there was a significant negative correlation between Œ¥13cdic Œ¥13cpoc and the abundance of chlorophyta bacillariophyta fig 9 a when co2 aq concentrations were lower than 30 ¬µmol l the dominant species shifted from chlorophyta and bacillariophyta to cyanobacteria fig 9b thus an appropriate increase in co2 aq concentrations can significantly enhance photosynthetic carbon sequestration and reduce the proportion of cyanobacteria when controlling n and p seasonal samples from all 12 sites were used in a redundancy analysis rda of the effects of environmental factors co2 tn co2 tp dic tn dic tp tn tp and temperature on phytoplankton communities cyanobacterial abundance chlorophyta abundance and bacillariophyta abundance chl a and the submerged macrophytes dry weight rda confirmed that the response of cyanobacteria to nutrients differs from that of chlorophyta and bacillariophyta in the growing season chlorophyta and bacillariophyta abundance increased when the c n and c p ratios increased whereas the cyanobacteria mass decreased in the spring summer and autumn samples site c4 differed from the other sampling sites the sample taken near the wharf had the highest pollution level of all the caohai lake samples as indicated by high chl a c n and c p values the analysis revealed that cyanobacteria favored low co2 conditions whereas chlorophyta and bacillariophyta favored higher co2 conditions previous studies have indicated that p and n concentrations dominate phytoplankton growth and strongly influence community composition and structure guildford and hecky 2000 kangur et al 2003 wejnerowski et al 2018 however the possible role of abundant c is ignored the principal phytoplankton taxa differ in their ability to fix inorganic c and adjust their growth response to elevated co2 concentrations falkowski and raven 2013 hare et al 2007 verschoor et al 2013 chlorophyta have higher c n p ratios 375 23 1 than cyanobacteria 160 22 1 as shown by king 1970 that is chlorophyta requires more carbon than cyanobacteria to grow shapiro 1973 the strongest cyanobacteria blooms tend to occur in water bodies with low co2 concentrations owing to the ccms that exploit both co2 and hco3 for carbonic anhydrase photosynthesis on cell surfaces aizawa and miyachi 1986 burnap et al 2015 price et al 1998 reinfelder 2011 shapiro 1990 van dam et al 2018 phytoplankton ccm is species specific raven et al 2020 chlorophyta and bacillariophyta favor higher co2 concentrations with low ccms and ribulose 1 5 bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase rubisco specificity low d√©carie et al 2011 2015 tortell et al 2002 it has been demonstrated that cyanobacteria has a higher rubisco maximum carboxylation rate than chlorophyta and bacillariophyta savir et al 2010 young et al 2016 consequently the limited availability of co2 may lead phytoplankton to shift from being dominated by chlorophyta and bacillariophyta which indicate relatively good water quality to being dominated by cyanobacteria which are associated with bad water quality thus forcing phytoplankton to use hco3 as an inorganic c source riebesell 2004 shi et al 2017 this finding may explain the increase in chlorophyta and bacillariophyta with increasing co2 concentrations reinfelder 2011 low d√©carie et al 2015 and the competitive advantages of low concentrations of co2 for the growth of cyanobacteria in summary cyanobacteria were more competitive than the other two phyla under low co2 conditions in addition changes in the concentrations of inorganic c and nutrients in the water significantly affect the growth of submerged plants d√ºlger et al 2017 the relationship between dic tp tn tp fig 8 and submerged macrophytes dry weight in caohai lake revealed that more c or n promoted macrophytes growth this finding is consistent with that of o hare et al 2010 who found that macrophyte biomass increased with an increase in the amount of carbon present as hco3 in 14 rivers across the uk improving the water quality and promoting the carbon sink more p inhibited the growth of submerged macrophytes which was not conducive to good water quality thus c n p ratios play a significant role in regulating phytoplankton and the biological structure composition of the submerged macrophyte biomass finally the negative correlation between submerged macrophytes dry weight and chl a observed in figs 5 and 10 demonstrates that submerged macrophytes can inhibit phytoplankton growth which can occur directly via allelopathy or indirectly via competition for nutrients dahlgren and kautsky 2004 k√∂rner and nicklisch 2002 vanderstukken et al 2011 this phenomenon offers another way to mitigate cyanobacteria bloomsin freshwater environments 4 3 possibilities and implications of mitigating cyanobacteria blooms and enhancing carbon sequestration by the bcp with co2 fertilization the below processes reflect the nature of photosynthesis in the aquatic ecosystem and the bcp concept liu et al 2010 2018 this emphasizes the role of c fertilization in photosynthesis and as a mechanism for the sequestration of atmospheric co2 1 ca 2 2 hco 3 photos caco 3 x co 2 h 2 o 1 x ch 2 o o 2 the bcp effect refers to photosynthesis caused by dic concentration dic fertilization effect which increases the aquatic biomass and enhances its carbon sequestration liu et al 2010 2018 the presence of inorganic c promotes an increase in primary production chl a and submerged macrophyte biomass in shallow karst lakes brothers et al 2013 hamdan et al 2018 jansson et al 2012 schippers et al 2004 vogt et al 2017 as verified in this study our analysis of the elemental ratios co2 tn co2 tp and tn tp and phytoplankton relationships revealed that the composition of phytoplankton communities varied as a function of co2 concentrations and ratios which is consistent with our hypothesis and the predictions of previous theoretical and experimental studies low d√©carie et al 2011 2014 2015 shi et al 2016 wolfe and siver 2013 efforts to decrease n and or p inputs into aquatic ecosystems to control eutrophication often result in reduced agricultural yields globally hossain and singh 2000 lu and tian 2017 our observations suggest that cyanobacteria blooms can be mitigated by regulating phytoplankton composition by injecting co2 into water bao et al 2022 which has no impact on agricultural productivity our findings in caohai lake show that c n and p co limit primary production and regulate the biological structure composition of phytoplankton and submerged macrophytes by the bcp effect which has significant implications for cyanobacteria blooms control and carbon neutralization a win win situation 5 conclusions in this study we investigated seasonal variations in the absolute and relative availability of nutrient concentrations c n c p and n p physicochemical parameters submerged macrophyte biomass and phytoplankton composition in caohai lake a typical karst lake in southwest china our results indicate that dissolved inorganic carbon promotes the primary production of phytoplankton chl a and macrophyte biomass therefore primary production may be limited not only by p and or n but also by c as a consequence of the distinct water chemistry characteristics of carbonate karst regions furthermore submerged macrophytes that inhibited phytoplankton growth were identified in this lake the increase in c n and c p ratios led to a reduction in the proportion of cyanobacteria over chlorophyta and bacillariophyta cya chl bac throughout the year particularly when the co2 tn and co2 tp ratios were higher than 0 2 and 10 respectively based on isotopic evidence the abundance of cyanobacteria was reduced by co2 fertilization especially when the co2 exceeded 30 ¬µmol l our study revealed that bcp on co2 fertilization in karst surface water ecosystems have synergistic effects on biological structure composition and carbon sequestration potentially a win win situation in contrast to the traditional approach of reducing n and or p we suggest that this is a possible step towards alleviating cyanobacteria blooms by adding emitted industrial co2 to water bodies after they are thoroughly treated from a variety of pollutants with a simple low cost and passive option in low pco2 aquatic ecosystems however further controlled experiments are needed to examine the effects of artificial addition of co2 on biological composition and carbon sequestration

2307,as one of the driest regions in the asia the ecological conditions in northwest china are very fragile although relative humidity rh plays a vital role in the environment the lack of long term rh records hinders the development of reliable scenarios for future extreme environmental conditions in this region we developed a new method for quantitative regional rh reconstruction in this method the signals of precipitation oxygen isotope ratios Œ¥18o and temperature in the tree ring Œ¥18o series are removed to extract the rh signal from the tree ring Œ¥18o records to the greatest extent we then combined published millennium tree ring Œ¥18o ice core Œ¥18o and paleo temperature data to reconstruct a new millennium long rh record around delingha qinghai china on the edge of the northeastern tibetan plateau tp the reconstructed rh was closely related to both temperature and rainfall and revealed cycles of approximately 35 85 130 160 and 200 years which are associated with solar insolation variations pacific decadal oscillation and the atlantic multidecadal variability with continuous global warming rh may decrease as the contribution of the temperature increase becomes

hydrological regulation and variations fan et al 2016 lu and takle 2010 shi et al 2018 the annual mean temperature and precipitation in arid regions such as qinghai liu et al 2013 wang et al 2014 have shown increasing trends during the past decades however local rh variations typically remain stable although the temperature in arid regions may increase significantly with continuous global warming in the future huang et al 2017 the response of rh to global warming is still unclear regional rh reconstructions in the past millennium such as the medieval climatic anomaly and the little ice age can help evaluate the impact of current climate change on ecosystems however long term quantitative rh data are rare paleo rh reconstructions with annual and decadal resolutions were primarily derived from historical documents and tree rings peng et al 2020 zheng et al 2014 but due to the interference from other climatic signals further effort is needed for these proxies to be used as quantitative rh indicators climate event distributions recorded by historic documents only indirectly indicate paleo rh variations as the frequently used drought flood index is typically categorized into five levels zheng et al 2014 namely extreme drought drought normal flood and extreme flood although proxies can qualitatively indicate the dry or wet conditions in a region establishing a quantitative relationship between the climate and a potential climate proxy for regression based rh reconstruction is difficult dendroclimatological studies could reveal continuous relative changes of climate

control Œ¥18ocell roden et al 2000 waterhouse et al 2002 these factors vary with climatic conditions and geographical locations firstly the source water Œ¥18os is primarily derived from precipitation Œ¥18o Œ¥18op waterhouse et al 2002 which shows clear interannual variations in china particularly in arid and semi arid areas for example 14 year monitoring of Œ¥18op at delingha meteorological station showed that annual mean Œ¥18op ranges from 10 10 to 6 06 yao et al 2013 because trees take in precipitation through their roots interannual variations in Œ¥18op can make an important contribution to interannual Œ¥18ocell variance secondly rh variations can control the evaporative enrichment of leaf water in 18o via stomatal transpiration dongmann et al 1974 and lower higher rh increases decreases evaporative Œ¥18o in leaf water result in increased decreased Œ¥18ocell qin et al 2015 thirdly the biological fractionation factor Œµ0 between xylem water and exchanged oxygen in the carbohydrate is temperature sensitive and Œµ0 changes little between 20 c and 30 c but increases at low temperatures sternberg and ellsworth 2011 thus the biological fractionation factor Œµ0 affects Œ¥18ocell in a low temperature environment consequently rh could be isolated from Œ¥18ocell records if the Œ¥18op signal and the temperature dependent biological fractionation can be removed in this study a new method is proposed for the quantitative reconstruction of regional rh by removing the signals of Œ¥18op and temperature in Œ¥18ocell we compiled the Œ¥18ocell records of recent decades and removed the biological fractionation factor effect the Œ¥18op signal was further removed from Œ¥18ocell to isolate rh related Œ¥Œ¥18o the influence of both the biological fractionation factor and Œ¥18op have been removed from the Œ¥18ocell signals we then analyzed the relationship between Œ¥Œ¥18o and rh and established their quantitative relationship using this method the rh signal can be isolated from the Œ¥18ocell records to the greatest extent based on corrected Œ¥18ocell we reconstructed a millennium rh variation around delingha qinghai china on the edge of the northeastern tibetan plateau tp using published 1000 year Œ¥18ocell wang et al 2019 paleo temperature wang et al 2015a and ice core Œ¥18o Œ¥18oice core thompson et al 2003 records 2 location data and methods 2 1 location the study area is located in the northeastern tp an arid semi arid transition zone with low temperature and precipitation the instrumental climate data between 1956 and 2016 ce from the meteorological station in delingha 37 37 n 97 37 e 2981 m a s l fig 1 a were used in this study fig 1b show an average annual mean temperature and precipitation of 3 94 c and 176 55 mm respectively most 85 of precipitation falls from may to september the annual mean rh is 38 49 with the highest and lowest values observed in july 46 80 and april 29 11 respectively fig 1b 2 2 data the instrumental observation Œ¥18op Œ¥18oice core and Œ¥18ocell data used in this study were collected from the various sites around delingha city qinghai china the sources and detailed information are provided in table 1 modern instrumental data including temperature precipitation and rh were obtained from a meteorological station in delingha fig 1a and downloaded from the china meteorological data service centre https data cma cn a 14 year Œ¥18op observation in the delingha meteorological station yao et al 2013 was used to investigate their contributions to Œ¥18ocell since the station is close to the tree ring sampling sites the Œ¥18o comparison between tree ring and precipitation is more reasonable the Œ¥18oice core record of the dunde 38 10 n 96 40 e 5325 m a s l located 150 km from delingha meteorological station was also used in this study the dataset covers the period 1010 1987 ce with a resolution of 10 year thompson et al 2003 ice caps are the products of rainfall or snow with similar Œ¥18o variations in precipitation tian et al 2006 yao et al 2013 yao et al 2013 as the location of the dunde ice core experiences similar climatic and circulation conditions the dunde Œ¥18oice core record should reflect Œ¥18op variations over the past millennium therefore the Œ¥18op from the delingha meteorological station and the dunde Œ¥18oice core are regarded as the Œ¥18os for the tree ring isotope series the resolutions of the three tree ring isotope records are annual namely Œ¥18odhl1 from the delingha1 sampling site dlh1 37 43 n 98 05 e 3670 m a s l wang et al 2019 Œ¥18omnt from the manitu sampling site mnt 37 46 n 97 68 e 3550 4050 m a s l qin et al 2015 and Œ¥18otj from the tianjun sampling site tj 37 3 n 98 4 e 3569 3600 m a s l xu et al 2011b a millennium Œ¥18ocell record from the delingha2 sampling site dhl2 37 27 n 97 53 e 4000 m a s l wang et al 2019 with a three year resolution is referred to Œ¥18odlh2 the common species of all Œ¥18ocell records used in this study is sabina przewalskii kom qilian juniper and were all measured by 5 20 individual tree ring isotope series wang et al 2019 qin et al 2015 xu et al 2011b wang et al 2013b the isotope series are significantly correlated with rh or pdsi during the growing season primarily in the summer table 1 as the locations of the three annually resolved records are considerably close to each other and their Œ¥18ocell variations are strongly correlated from 1992 to 2005 ce r 0 82 n 14 we averaged the data collected from these sites Œ¥18odhl1 Œ¥18omnt and Œ¥18otj to form a composite Œ¥18ocell sequence namely Œ¥18odmt 2 3 methods 2 3 1 correction of Œ¥18os we removed Œ¥18os including Œ¥18op and dunde Œ¥18oice core in tree ring Œ¥18o to obtain the local rh signal although the sites of Œ¥18op and dunde Œ¥18oice core were close to the tree ring sampling sites in our study area elevations were different from site to site before precipitation and ice core data can be used to remove Œ¥18os from Œ¥18ocell the altitude effect of Œ¥18op should be corrected to evaluate the influence of altitude on Œ¥18os we used the observed Œ¥18op and Œ¥18oice core located on the tp or surrounding areas north of 35 n more details in table 2 in the correlation analysis all data of Œ¥18op and Œ¥18oice core were obtained from the global network of isotopes in precipitation the national tibetan plateau data center and references therein thompson et al 2003 thompson et al 2018 tian et al 2006 wang et al 2006 we used the annual weighted average value of Œ¥18op and annual Œ¥18oice core to establish correlations with latitude longitude and altitude as shown in fig 2 altitude is most strongly correlated with Œ¥18o r 0 97 p 0 01 n 9 while the effects of latitude and longitude are less significant the slope 0 15 100 m of the altitude effect of Œ¥18o is close to that 0 17 100 m in an earlier study yao et al 2013 therefore we used this slope to correct for the altitude effects the altitudes of the delingha meteorological station and dunde ice core are 2981 m a s l and 5325 m a s l respectively and their altitude differences 1019 m a s l and 1325 m a s l respectively were corrected to an elevation of 4000 m a s l close to the elevation of the tree ring locations thus 1 53 and 1 99 were added to the raw data of the Œ¥18op and dunde Œ¥18oice core series respectively 2 3 2 calculation of biological fractionation factor Œµ0 the biological fractionation factor Œµ0 is sensitive to temperature changes sternberg and ellsworth 2011 and it increases at lower temperatures temperature variations may affect the transfer of the leaf water isotope signal to organic matter through their effects on Œµ0 gessler et al 2014 thus the temperature effect in Œ¥18ocell should be removed particularly in the growing season in terms of tree physiology the monitored growing season of qilian juniper on the tp occurs from may to august wang et al 2015b he et al 2016 Œ¥18ocell including Œ¥18odlh1 Œ¥18omnt Œ¥18otj and Œ¥18odlh2 records show a significant negative correlation with moisture variations although the durations of growing season from tree ring records are different table 1 for example the growing season of Œ¥18odlh1 Œ¥18omnt Œ¥18otj and Œ¥18odlh2 occurs from june to july wang et al 2019 may to september qin et al 2015 and july to august xu et al 2011b wang et al 2013b respectively meaning summer is the main stem radial increment period during the summer june august the temperature anomalies wang et al 2015a of the eastern tp and instrumental temperature of the delingha meteorological station show a correlation of 0 53 p 0 01 from 1956 to 2005 ce based on this correlation the millennial summer temperature in delingha region was obtained by linear regression the millennium temperature record of the delingha was then used to derive the biological fractionation factor Œµ0 using the following equation sternberg and ellsworth 2011 1 Œµ 0 0 0084 t 2 0 51 t 33 17 where t is the temperature during cellulose synthesis thus we removed the effect of temperature on Œ¥18ocell 2 3 3 Œ¥18ocell isotope fractionation model according to the Œ¥18ocell isotope fractionation model roden et al 2000 waterhouse et al 2002 the relationships between rh Œ¥18os and Œ¥18ocell can be presented as follows 2 Œ¥ 18 o cell 1 f 0 Œ¥ 18 o s Œµ e Œµ k 1 r h Œµ 0 f 0 Œ¥ 18 o s Œµ 0 where f0 is the transition ratio between the cellulose molecule and stem water Œ¥18o and Œµe and Œµk are the equilibrium and dynamic fractionation factors respectively these three factors are constant contrastingly Œµ0 the biological Œ¥18o fractionation factor is sensitive to temperature sternberg and ellsworth 2011 Œ¥18op showed high temporal and spatial variability liu et al 2008b yao et al 2013 and the observed temperature and paleo temperature reconstruction changed at interannual to decadal timescales thus a negative relationship between the Œ¥18o difference Œ¥Œ¥18o Œ¥18ocell Œµ0 Œ¥18os and rh is established and the equation is expressed as follows 3 Œ¥ 18 o cell Œµ 0 Œ¥ 18 o s r h Œµ e Œµ k f 0 Œµ e f 0 Œµ k 1 f 0 Œµ e Œµ k 2 3 4 modern and millennial Œ¥Œ¥18o the oxygen isotope difference of Œ¥Œ¥18odmt 1 Œ¥18odmt Œµ0 and Œ¥Œ¥18odmt 2 Œ¥18odmt Œµ0 Œ¥18os was obtained by subtracting the biological fractionation factor Œµ0 from the Œ¥18odmt fig 3 a and subtracting both the biological fractionation factor Œµ0 and Œ¥18os i e the Œ¥18op corrected by the altitude effect from the Œ¥18odmt during the common period 1992 2005 a d the correlations between monthly rh from the delingha meteorological station and Œ¥18odmt Œ¥Œ¥18odmt 1 and Œ¥Œ¥18odmt 2 fig 3b during the growing season were analyzed to explore the response of Œ¥Œ¥18o to the local rh the linear regression equation could be established fig 3c and its robustness evaluated using the leave one out method michaelsen 1987 the original paleoclimatic records including tree ring ice core and paleo temperature reconstructions in our study area exhibited different temporal resolutions over the past millennium to reconstruct the rh the above mentioned records had to be synchronized to a decadal resolution we interpolated the 3 year resolution record of Œ¥18odlh2 wang et al 2019 to form an annual record from delingha over the past millennium and then averaged the 10 year blocks of annual Œ¥18odlh2 similarly we converted the annual data to 10 year averaged data of the biological fractionation factor Œµ0 from 1010 to 1990 ce after applying the same approach to obtain Œ¥Œ¥18o Œ¥18odmt Œµ0 Œ¥18op in the modern records fig 4 the final millennial Œ¥Œ¥18o Œ¥18odlh2 Œµ0 Œ¥18oice core record was created by subtracting both the biological fractionation factor Œµ0 and the altitude adjusted Œ¥18oice core thompson et al 2003 from tree ring Œ¥18odlh2 wang et al 2019 using the linear regression equation based on the modern correlation between Œ¥Œ¥18odmt 2 and rh the Œ¥Œ¥18o sequence can be transferred to a quantitative rh record 3 results 3 1 Œ¥Œ¥18o response to rh the correlation results between the monthly rh records and the original tree ring cellulose Œ¥18odmt Œ¥Œ¥18odmt 1 adjusted by temperature effect and Œ¥Œ¥18odmt 2 adjusted by both temperature effect and Œ¥18op from 1992 to 2005 ce are shown as yellow gray and blue columns respectively in fig 3b for example between june and august the correlation coefficient between Œ¥18odmt and summer rh was 0 40 it is improved to 0 46 if Œ¥18odmt was replaced by Œ¥Œ¥18odmt 1 as the influence of temperature is removed when Œ¥18odmt was replaced by Œ¥Œ¥18odmt 2 after being adjusted by both temperature and Œ¥18op the correlation coefficient improved significantly to 0 63 p 0 05 the correlations between Œ¥Œ¥18o and temperature or rainfall failed to pass any significance tests indicating that the Œ¥Œ¥18o is more sensitive to rh compared with Œ¥18odmt and Œ¥Œ¥18odmt 1 the correlation coefficients between Œ¥Œ¥18odmt 2 and rh in different seasonal windows such as may september and april october still passed a significance level of 0 01 thus Œ¥Œ¥18odmt 2 is used to improve the rh reconstruction in the past millennium 3 2 rh reconstruction the rh reconstruction was calculated based on the linear regression equation in fig 3c the leave one out method michaelsen 1987 was used to test the robustness of the derived climate proxy relationship the reconstructed average rh of the leave one out method was 44 74 similar to the observed average rh of 44 88 from the june august climate data in delingha with a correlation coefficient of 0 49 with the instrumental dataset these test results suggest that the equation can be applied to reconstruct the rh in delingha region the Œ¥18odlh2 fig 5 a biological fractionation factor Œµ0 fig 5b and Œ¥18oice core fig 5c records were used to reconstruct the rh record fig 5d for the northeastern tp over the last millennium the average rh value was 45 73 1 66 with a maximum rh value of 49 99 1840 ce and a minimum rh value of 41 29 1310 ce the reconstructed rh record witnessed six humid periods blue shades during 1010 1110 ce 1220 1260 ce 1360 1390 ce 1550 1650 ce 1700 1775 ce and 1830 1960 ce and five dry periods orange shades from 1110 to 1220 ce 1260 1360 ce 1390 1550 ce 1650 1700 ce and 1775 1830 ce we calculated the periodicity of the rh reconstruction via the multi taper method the results revealed distinct cycles of approximately 35 year 130 160 year 200 year at confidence levels of 99 and approximately 85 year at 95 confidence fig 6 a 4 discussions 4 1 uncertainties in rh reconstruction two sources of errors contribute to the uncertainty to the rh reconstruction namely the analytical errors of both tree ring and ice core Œ¥18o and the uncertain of ice core chronology the analytical errors standard deviation of Œ¥18ocell wang et al 2019 and Œ¥18oice core thompson et al 2003 tian et al 2006 are 0 3 and 0 2 respectively and a conservative estimate of error is 0 36 in Œ¥Œ¥18odmt 2 equivalent to 0 57 in rh the shift of the ice core age off tree ring chronology may decouple Œ¥18ocell with Œ¥18oice core resulting in the error in the final millennial Œ¥Œ¥18o to evaluate the rh reconstruction error caused by the uncertainty of chronology we shifted the ice core records off tree ring chronology for 20 10 0 10 and 20 years respectively and calculated their Œ¥Œ¥18o values in the past millennium we averaged all five sets of Œ¥Œ¥18o and calculated their standard deviations then converted to the rh and its uncertainty based on the Œ¥Œ¥18odmt 2 rh relationship mentioned above we found that rh reconstruction fig 7 b is similar to the rh without considering the age uncertainty fig 5d with a correlation coefficient of 0 93 n 99 p 0 01 indicating that the age error within 20 years has negligible effect on our reconstructed rh record we assessed average Œ¥Œ¥18o errors 0 61 using the following equation 4 and evaluated the uncertainty of rh reconstruction as 0 97 based on the rh Œ¥Œ¥18o relationship 4 Œ¥ Œ¥ 18 o e r r o r a 2 b 2 c 2 n 1 where a is the chronology error b and c are isotopic measurement errors in the tree ring and ice core respectively n is the number of errors that is equal to 3 in this study 4 2 effect of temperature and precipitation on rh the reconstructed rh revealed multidecadal to centennial fluctuations coincident with the trend of tree ring Œ¥18odlh2 wang et al 2019 solar insolation variations steinhilber et al 2009 precipitation from the mt qilian region yang et al 2014 and reconstructed streamflow amount from the yellow river li et al 2019 over the past millennium fig 7 the periodical analysis also revealed approximately 35 year and centennial cycles the 35 year cycle was reported from tree ring based pdsi and streamflow amount reconstructions in arid and semi arid areas cai et al 2013 gou et al 2010 fang et al 2010 liu et al 2019a these reconstructions are related to the interaction between temperature and precipitation the 35 year cycle is also related to the periodicity of the pacific decadal oscillation mantua et al 1997 an interdecadal mode of the north pacific sea surface temperature suggesting possible atmosphere ocean interactions centennial cycles of 130 160 year and 200 year were generally stable during the last millennium fig 6b these centennial cycles are related to the precipitation variation influenced by the asm li 2020 sun et al 2015 yang et al 2014 which are also associated with solar insolation variations sun et al 2015 as an external driving force owing to the land sea thermal contrast the asm transfers large amounts of moisture to the asian continent leading to an increase in precipitation and high rh conditions within the asm realm in our study site and surrounding areas li 2020 yang et al 2014 a cycle of approximately 85 year is associated with atlantic multidecadal variability wang et al 2017 which also influences air temperature and precipitation to some degree lu et al 2006 wang et al 2013a sang et al 2020 indirectly impacting the local rh variations in most periods of high rh precipitation was above average while the temperature was below average and vice versa we propose that the rh is the interaction between temperature and precipitation in this arid region to assess this relationship a binary regression function rh 86 37 2 61 temperature 0 09 precipitation r 0 48 fig 8 was developed for the delingha region based on our rh reconstruction the corrected summer temperature c fig 5f wang et al 2015a and precipitation fig 5e yang et al 2014 in this function rh had a negative correlation with temperature rh decreased by 2 61 per degree of warming and a positive correlation with precipitation rh increased by 0 09 per one percent increase in precipitation the atmospheric water vapor content increased with air temperature by approximately 7 c according to the clausius clapeyron relation thus precipitation increases more easily under warming conditions if precipitation is expected to increase by 7 per degree of warming the regional rh may increase by 0 63 via our binary regression function overall the effect of temperature on regional rh is stronger than that of precipitation in our study region in contrast to the increasing trends of temperature and rainfall during the current warm period the instrumental rh shows a decreasing trend consistent with that of the moisture reconstructions from sugan lake li 2020 and the hexi corridor yang et al 2019 we argue that rh will decrease in the near future as global warming reaches or exceeds 1 5 c through the special report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change and sulfate aerosols produced by humans may decrease the intensity of the asm liu et al 2019b 5 conclusions tree ring Œ¥18ocell contains local including temperature and humidity conditions and moisture sources signals we presented the foundation for a new method of extracting the local rh signal from Œ¥18ocell records to the greatest extent we found that 1 Œ¥18ocell responded to rh after removing the influence of temperature and Œ¥18os and provided a potential proxy to reconstruct rh 2 the reconstructed millennium rh record based on the new method revealed cycles of approximately 35 85 130 160 and 200 years consistent with local hydrothermal changes and are influenced by solar insolation variations pacific decadal oscillation and atlantic multidecadal variabilities 3 with continuous global warming rh values in the study region may further decrease as the contribution of temperature becomes greater than that of the precipitation credit authorship contribution statement yaling wu methodology validation formal analysis

2307,as one of the driest regions in the asia the ecological conditions in northwest china are very fragile although relative humidity rh plays a vital role in the environment the lack of long term rh records hinders the development of reliable scenarios for future extreme environmental conditions in this region we developed a new method for quantitative regional rh reconstruction in this method the signals of precipitation oxygen isotope ratios Œ¥18o and temperature in the tree ring Œ¥18o series are removed to extract the rh signal from the tree ring Œ¥18o records to the greatest extent we then combined published millennium tree ring Œ¥18o ice core Œ¥18o and paleo temperature data to reconstruct a new millennium long rh record around delingha qinghai china on the edge of the northeastern tibetan plateau tp the reconstructed rh was closely related to both temperature and rainfall and revealed cycles of approximately 35 85 130 160 and 200 years which are associated with solar insolation variations pacific decadal oscillation and the atlantic multidecadal variability with continuous global warming rh may decrease as the contribution of the temperature increase becomes larger than that of the precipitation over the northeastern tp this study provides a basis for a new method of rh reconstruction based on different paleoclimate archives keywords tree ring ice core

change owing to their fragile regional ecosystems wang and cheng 2000 huang et al 2015 climatic factors including temperature precipitation and relative humidity rh play important roles in hydrological regulation and variations fan et al 2016 lu and takle 2010 shi et al 2018 the annual mean temperature and precipitation in arid regions such as qinghai liu et al 2013 wang et al 2014 have shown increasing trends during the past decades however local rh variations typically remain stable although the temperature in arid regions may increase significantly with continuous global warming in the future huang et al 2017 the response of rh to global warming is still unclear regional rh reconstructions in the past millennium such as the medieval climatic anomaly and the little ice age can help evaluate the impact of current climate change on ecosystems however long term quantitative rh data are rare paleo rh reconstructions with annual and decadal resolutions were primarily derived from historical documents and tree rings peng et al 2020 zheng et al 2014 but due to the interference from other climatic signals further effort is needed for these proxies to be used as quantitative rh indicators climate event distributions recorded by historic documents only indirectly indicate paleo rh variations as the frequently used drought flood index is typically categorized into five levels zheng et al 2014 namely extreme drought drought normal flood and extreme flood although proxies can qualitatively indicate the dry or wet conditions in a region establishing a quantitative relationship between the climate and a potential climate proxy for regression based rh reconstruction is difficult dendroclimatological studies could reveal continuous relative changes of climate suggesting that changes in tree ring width trw may respond to rh variations he et al 2019 thus trw has been applied to reconstruct drought indices such as the palmer drought severity index pdsi or rh directly liu et al 2016 peng et al 2020 yang et al 2019 however the trw series may have limitations in preserving low frequency climate signals because biological growth can possibly overlap with climate induced growth variations he et al 2019 stable oxygen isotope ratios Œ¥18o in tree ring cellulose Œ¥18ocell can preserve low frequency climate signals b√ºntgen et al 2021 yang et al 2021 as Œ¥18ocell are considerably less influenced by inherent biological trends sano et al 2013 xu et al 2016 allowing Œ¥18ocell to provide precisely dated high resolution time series that are typically highly sensitive to climate change mccarroll and loader 2004 the mechanisms of oxygen isotope fractionation between tree ring cells and water are well understood gessler et al 2014 making Œ¥18ocell a good indicator of variations in climate parameters such as temperature huang et al 2019 precipitation foroozan et al 2020 liu et al 2008a xu et al 2016 pumijumnong et al 2020 xu et al 2015 and rh liu et al 2015 wernicke et al 2014 grieŒ≤inger et al 2019 hence it has been used to reconstruct more complex climatic phenomena such as asian summer monsoon asm grieŒ≤inger et al 2011 shi et al 2016 and the el ni√±o southern oscillation liu et al 2017 xu et al 2019 xu et al 2011a pumijumnong et al 2021 contributing to the better understanding of the occurrence of regional droughts and their driving mechanisms wang et al 2020 xu et al 2014 the Œ¥18ocell isotope fractionation model demonstrates that three major factors namely source water Œ¥18o Œ¥18os rh and biological fractionation factor Œµ0 control Œ¥18ocell roden et al 2000 waterhouse et al 2002 these factors vary with climatic conditions and geographical locations firstly the source water Œ¥18os is primarily derived from precipitation Œ¥18o Œ¥18op waterhouse et al 2002 which shows clear interannual variations in china particularly in arid and semi arid areas for example 14 year monitoring of Œ¥18op at delingha meteorological station showed that annual mean Œ¥18op ranges from 10 10 to 6 06 yao et al 2013 because trees take in precipitation through their roots interannual variations in Œ¥18op can make an important contribution to interannual Œ¥18ocell variance secondly rh variations can control the evaporative enrichment of leaf water in 18o via stomatal transpiration dongmann et al 1974 and lower higher rh increases decreases evaporative Œ¥18o in leaf water result in increased decreased Œ¥18ocell qin et al 2015 thirdly the biological fractionation factor Œµ0 between xylem water and exchanged oxygen in the carbohydrate is temperature sensitive and Œµ0 changes little between 20 c and 30 c but increases at low temperatures sternberg and ellsworth 2011 thus the biological fractionation factor Œµ0 affects Œ¥18ocell in a low temperature environment consequently rh could be isolated from Œ¥18ocell records if the Œ¥18op signal and the temperature dependent biological fractionation can be removed in this study a new method is proposed for the quantitative reconstruction of regional rh by removing the signals of Œ¥18op and temperature in Œ¥18ocell we compiled the Œ¥18ocell records of recent decades and removed the biological fractionation factor effect the Œ¥18op signal was further removed from Œ¥18ocell to isolate rh related Œ¥Œ¥18o the influence of both the biological fractionation factor and Œ¥18op have been removed from the Œ¥18ocell signals we then analyzed the relationship between Œ¥Œ¥18o and rh and established their quantitative relationship using this method the rh signal can be isolated from the Œ¥18ocell records to the greatest extent based on corrected Œ¥18ocell we reconstructed a millennium rh variation around delingha qinghai china on the edge of the northeastern tibetan plateau tp using published 1000 year Œ¥18ocell wang et al 2019 paleo temperature wang et al 2015a and ice core Œ¥18o Œ¥18oice core thompson et al 2003 records 2 location data and methods 2 1

most 85 of precipitation falls from may to september the annual mean rh is 38 49 with the highest and lowest values observed in july 46 80 and april 29 11 respectively fig 1b 2 2 data the instrumental observation Œ¥18op Œ¥18oice core and Œ¥18ocell data used in this study were collected from the various sites around delingha city qinghai china the sources and detailed information are provided in table 1 modern instrumental data including temperature precipitation and rh were obtained from a meteorological station in delingha fig 1a and downloaded from the china meteorological data service centre https data cma cn a 14 year Œ¥18op observation in the delingha meteorological station yao et al 2013 was used to investigate their contributions to Œ¥18ocell since the station is close to the tree ring sampling sites the Œ¥18o comparison between tree ring and precipitation is more reasonable the Œ¥18oice core record of the dunde 38 10 n 96 40 e 5325 m a s l located 150 km from delingha meteorological station was also used in this study the dataset covers the period 1010 1987 ce with a resolution of 10 year thompson et al 2003 ice caps are the products of rainfall or snow with similar Œ¥18o variations in precipitation tian et al 2006 yao et al 2013 yao et al 2013 as the location of the dunde ice core experiences similar climatic and circulation conditions the dunde Œ¥18oice core record should reflect Œ¥18op variations over the past millennium therefore the Œ¥18op from the delingha meteorological station and the dunde Œ¥18oice core are regarded as the Œ¥18os for the tree ring isotope series the resolutions of the three tree ring isotope records are annual namely Œ¥18odhl1 from the delingha1 sampling site dlh1 37 43 n 98 05 e 3670 m a s l wang et al 2019 Œ¥18omnt from the manitu sampling site mnt 37 46 n 97 68 e 3550 4050 m a s l qin et al 2015 and Œ¥18otj from the tianjun sampling site tj 37 3 n 98 4 e 3569 3600 m a s l xu et al 2011b a millennium Œ¥18ocell record from the delingha2 sampling site dhl2 37 27 n 97 53 e 4000 m a s l wang et al 2019 with a three year resolution is referred to Œ¥18odlh2 the common species of all Œ¥18ocell records used in this study is sabina przewalskii kom qilian juniper and were all measured by 5 20 individual tree ring isotope series wang et al 2019 qin et al 2015 xu et al 2011b wang et al 2013b the isotope series are significantly correlated with rh or pdsi during the growing season primarily in the summer table 1 as the locations of the three annually resolved records are considerably close to each other and their Œ¥18ocell variations are strongly correlated from 1992 to 2005 ce r 0 82 n 14 we averaged the data collected from these sites Œ¥18odhl1 Œ¥18omnt and Œ¥18otj to form a composite Œ¥18ocell sequence namely Œ¥18odmt 2 3 methods 2 3 1 correction of Œ¥18os we removed Œ¥18os including Œ¥18op and dunde Œ¥18oice core in tree ring Œ¥18o to obtain the local rh signal although the sites of Œ¥18op and dunde Œ¥18oice core were close to the tree ring sampling sites in our study area elevations were different from site to site before precipitation and ice core data can be used to remove Œ¥18os from Œ¥18ocell the altitude effect of Œ¥18op should be corrected to evaluate the influence of altitude on Œ¥18os we used the observed Œ¥18op and Œ¥18oice core located on the tp or surrounding areas north of 35 n more details in table 2 in the correlation analysis all data of Œ¥18op and Œ¥18oice core were obtained from the global network of isotopes in precipitation the national tibetan plateau data center and references therein thompson et al 2003 thompson et al 2018 tian et al 2006 wang et al 2006 we used the annual weighted average value of Œ¥18op and annual Œ¥18oice core to establish correlations with latitude longitude and altitude as shown in fig 2 altitude is most strongly correlated with Œ¥18o r 0 97 p 0 01 n 9 while the effects of latitude and longitude are less significant the slope 0 15 100 m of the altitude effect of Œ¥18o is close to that 0 17 100 m in an earlier study yao et al 2013 therefore we used this slope to correct for the altitude effects the altitudes of the delingha meteorological station and dunde ice core are 2981 m a s l and 5325 m a s l respectively and their altitude differences 1019 m a s l and 1325 m a s l respectively were corrected to an elevation of 4000 m a s l close to the elevation of the tree ring locations thus 1 53 and 1 99 were added to the raw data of the Œ¥18op and dunde Œ¥18oice core series respectively 2 3 2 calculation of biological fractionation factor Œµ0 the biological fractionation factor Œµ0 is sensitive to temperature changes sternberg and ellsworth 2011 and it increases at lower temperatures temperature variations may affect the transfer of the leaf water isotope signal to organic matter through their effects on Œµ0 gessler et al 2014 thus the temperature effect in Œ¥18ocell should be removed particularly in the growing season in terms of tree physiology the monitored growing season of qilian juniper on the tp occurs from may to august wang et al 2015b he et al 2016 Œ¥18ocell including Œ¥18odlh1 Œ¥18omnt Œ¥18otj and Œ¥18odlh2 records show a significant negative correlation with moisture variations although the durations of growing season from tree ring records are different table 1 for example the growing season of Œ¥18odlh1 Œ¥18omnt Œ¥18otj and Œ¥18odlh2 occurs from june to july wang et al 2019 may to september qin et al 2015 and july to august xu et al 2011b wang et al 2013b respectively meaning summer is the main stem radial increment period during the summer june august the temperature anomalies wang et al 2015a of the eastern tp and instrumental temperature of the delingha meteorological station show a correlation of 0 53 p 0 01 from 1956 to 2005 ce based on this correlation the millennial summer temperature in delingha region was obtained by linear regression the millennium temperature record of the delingha was then used to derive the biological fractionation factor Œµ0 using the following equation sternberg and ellsworth 2011 1 Œµ 0 0 0084 t 2 0 51 t 33 17 where t is the temperature during cellulose synthesis thus we removed the effect of temperature on Œ¥18ocell 2 3 3 Œ¥18ocell isotope fractionation model according to the Œ¥18ocell isotope fractionation model roden et al 2000 waterhouse et al 2002 the relationships between rh Œ¥18os and Œ¥18ocell can be presented as follows 2 Œ¥ 18 o cell 1 f 0 Œ¥ 18 o s Œµ e Œµ k 1 r h Œµ 0 f 0 Œ¥ 18 o s Œµ 0 where f0 is the transition ratio between the cellulose molecule and stem water Œ¥18o and Œµe and Œµk are the equilibrium and dynamic fractionation factors respectively these three factors are constant contrastingly Œµ0 the biological Œ¥18o fractionation factor is sensitive to temperature sternberg and ellsworth 2011 Œ¥18op showed high temporal and spatial variability liu et al 2008b yao et al 2013 and the observed temperature and paleo temperature reconstruction changed at interannual to decadal timescales thus a negative relationship between the Œ¥18o difference Œ¥Œ¥18o Œ¥18ocell Œµ0 Œ¥18os and rh is established and the equation is expressed as follows 3 Œ¥ 18 o cell Œµ 0 Œ¥ 18 o s r h Œµ e Œµ k f 0 Œµ e f 0 Œµ k 1 f 0 Œµ e Œµ k 2 3 4 modern and millennial Œ¥Œ¥18o the oxygen isotope difference of Œ¥Œ¥18odmt 1 Œ¥18odmt Œµ0 and Œ¥Œ¥18odmt 2 Œ¥18odmt Œµ0 Œ¥18os was obtained by subtracting the biological fractionation factor Œµ0 from the Œ¥18odmt fig 3 a and subtracting both the biological fractionation factor Œµ0 and Œ¥18os i e the Œ¥18op corrected by the altitude effect from the Œ¥18odmt during the common period 1992 2005 a d the correlations between monthly rh from the delingha meteorological station and Œ¥18odmt Œ¥Œ¥18odmt 1 and Œ¥Œ¥18odmt 2 fig 3b during the growing season were analyzed to explore the response of Œ¥Œ¥18o to the local rh the linear regression equation could be established fig 3c and its robustness evaluated using the leave one out method michaelsen 1987 the original paleoclimatic records including tree ring ice core and paleo temperature reconstructions in our study area exhibited different temporal resolutions over the past millennium to reconstruct the rh the above mentioned records had to be synchronized to a decadal resolution we interpolated the 3 year resolution record of Œ¥18odlh2 wang et al 2019 to form an annual record from delingha over the past millennium and then averaged the 10 year blocks of annual Œ¥18odlh2 similarly we converted the annual data to 10 year averaged data of the biological fractionation factor Œµ0 from 1010 to 1990 ce after applying the same approach to obtain Œ¥Œ¥18o Œ¥18odmt Œµ0 Œ¥18op in the modern records fig 4 the final millennial Œ¥Œ¥18o Œ¥18odlh2 Œµ0 Œ¥18oice core record was created by subtracting both the biological fractionation factor Œµ0 and the altitude adjusted Œ¥18oice core thompson et al 2003 from tree ring Œ¥18odlh2 wang et al 2019 using the linear regression equation based on the modern correlation between Œ¥Œ¥18odmt 2 and rh the Œ¥Œ¥18o sequence can be transferred to a quantitative rh record 3 results 3 1 Œ¥Œ¥18o response to rh the correlation results between the monthly rh records and the original tree ring cellulose Œ¥18odmt Œ¥Œ¥18odmt 1 adjusted by temperature effect and Œ¥Œ¥18odmt 2 adjusted by both temperature effect and Œ¥18op from 1992 to 2005 ce are shown as yellow gray and blue columns respectively in fig 3b for example between june and august the correlation coefficient between Œ¥18odmt and summer rh was 0 40 it is improved to 0 46 if Œ¥18odmt was replaced by Œ¥Œ¥18odmt 1 as the influence of temperature is removed when Œ¥18odmt was replaced by Œ¥Œ¥18odmt 2 after being adjusted by both temperature and Œ¥18op the correlation coefficient improved significantly to 0 63 p 0 05 the correlations between Œ¥Œ¥18o and temperature or rainfall failed to pass any significance tests indicating that the Œ¥Œ¥18o is more sensitive to rh compared with Œ¥18odmt and Œ¥Œ¥18odmt 1 the correlation coefficients between Œ¥Œ¥18odmt 2 and rh in different seasonal windows such as may september and april october still passed a significance level of 0 01 thus Œ¥Œ¥18odmt 2 is used to improve the rh reconstruction in the past millennium 3 2 rh reconstruction the rh reconstruction was calculated based on the linear regression equation in fig 3c the leave one out method michaelsen 1987 was used to test the robustness of the derived climate proxy relationship the reconstructed average rh of the leave one out method was 44 74 similar to the observed average rh of 44 88 from the june august climate data in delingha with a correlation coefficient of 0 49 with the instrumental dataset these test results suggest that the equation can be applied to reconstruct the rh in delingha region the Œ¥18odlh2 fig 5 a biological fractionation factor Œµ0 fig 5b and Œ¥18oice core fig 5c records were used to reconstruct the rh record fig 5d for the northeastern tp over the last millennium the average rh value was 45 73 1 66 with a maximum rh value of 49 99 1840 ce and a minimum rh value of 41 29 1310 ce the reconstructed rh record witnessed six humid periods blue shades during 1010 1110 ce 1220 1260 ce 1360 1390 ce 1550 1650 ce 1700 1775 ce and 1830 1960 ce and five dry periods orange shades from 1110 to 1220 ce 1260 1360 ce 1390 1550 ce 1650 1700 ce and 1775 1830 ce we calculated the periodicity of the rh reconstruction via the multi taper method the results revealed distinct cycles of approximately 35 year 130 160 year 200 year at confidence levels of 99 and approximately 85 year at 95 confidence fig 6 a 4 discussions 4 1 uncertainties in rh reconstruction two sources of errors contribute to the uncertainty to the rh reconstruction namely the analytical errors of both tree ring and ice core Œ¥18o and the uncertain of ice core chronology the analytical errors standard deviation of Œ¥18ocell wang et al 2019 and Œ¥18oice core thompson et al 2003 tian et al 2006 are 0 3 and 0 2 respectively and a conservative estimate of error is 0 36 in Œ¥Œ¥18odmt 2 equivalent to 0 57 in rh the shift of the ice core age off tree ring chronology may decouple Œ¥18ocell with Œ¥18oice core resulting in the error in the final millennial Œ¥Œ¥18o to evaluate the rh reconstruction error caused by the uncertainty of chronology we shifted the ice core records off tree ring chronology for 20 10 0 10 and 20 years respectively and calculated their Œ¥Œ¥18o values in the past millennium we averaged all five sets of Œ¥Œ¥18o and calculated their standard deviations then converted to the rh and its uncertainty based on the Œ¥Œ¥18odmt 2 rh relationship mentioned above we found that rh reconstruction fig 7 b is similar to the rh without considering the age uncertainty fig 5d with a correlation coefficient of 0 93 n 99 p 0 01 indicating that the age error within 20 years has negligible effect on our reconstructed rh record we assessed average Œ¥Œ¥18o errors 0 61 using the following equation 4 and evaluated the uncertainty of rh reconstruction as 0 97 based on the rh Œ¥Œ¥18o relationship 4 Œ¥ Œ¥ 18 o e r r o r a 2 b 2 c 2 n 1 where a is the chronology error b and c are isotopic measurement errors in the tree ring and ice core respectively n is the number of errors that is equal to 3 in this study 4 2 effect of temperature and precipitation on rh the reconstructed rh revealed multidecadal to centennial fluctuations coincident with the trend of tree ring Œ¥18odlh2 wang et al 2019 solar insolation variations steinhilber et al 2009 precipitation from the mt qilian region yang et al 2014 and reconstructed streamflow amount from the yellow river li et al 2019 over the past millennium fig 7 the periodical analysis also revealed approximately 35 year and centennial cycles the 35 year cycle was reported from tree ring based pdsi and streamflow amount reconstructions in arid and semi arid areas cai et al 2013 gou et al 2010 fang et al 2010 liu et al 2019a these reconstructions are related to the interaction between temperature and precipitation the 35 year cycle is also related to the periodicity of the pacific decadal oscillation mantua et al 1997 an interdecadal mode of the north pacific sea surface temperature suggesting possible atmosphere ocean interactions centennial cycles of 130 160 year and 200 year were generally stable during the last millennium fig 6b these centennial cycles are related to the precipitation variation influenced by the asm li 2020 sun et al 2015 yang et al 2014 which are also associated with solar insolation variations sun et al 2015 as an external driving force owing to the land sea thermal contrast the asm transfers large amounts of moisture to the asian continent leading to an increase in precipitation and high rh conditions within the asm realm in our study site and surrounding areas li 2020 yang et al 2014 a cycle of approximately 85 year is associated with atlantic multidecadal variability wang et al 2017 which also influences air temperature and precipitation to some degree lu et al 2006 wang et al 2013a sang et al 2020 indirectly impacting the local rh variations in most periods of high rh precipitation was above average while the temperature was below average and vice versa we propose that the rh is the interaction between temperature and precipitation in this arid region to assess this relationship a binary regression function rh 86 37 2 61 temperature 0 09 precipitation r 0 48 fig 8 was developed for the delingha region based on our rh reconstruction the corrected summer temperature c fig 5f wang et al 2015a and precipitation fig 5e yang et al 2014 in this function rh had a negative correlation with temperature rh decreased by 2 61 per degree of warming and a positive correlation with precipitation rh increased by 0 09 per one percent increase in precipitation the atmospheric water vapor content increased with air temperature by approximately 7 c according to the clausius clapeyron relation thus precipitation increases more easily under warming conditions if precipitation is expected to increase by 7 per degree of warming the regional rh may increase by 0 63 via our binary regression function overall the effect of temperature on regional rh is stronger than that of precipitation in our study region in contrast to the increasing trends of temperature and rainfall during the current warm period the instrumental rh shows a decreasing trend consistent with that of the moisture reconstructions from sugan lake li 2020 and the hexi corridor yang et al 2019 we argue that rh will decrease in the near future as global warming reaches or exceeds 1 5 c through the special report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change and sulfate aerosols produced by humans may decrease the intensity of the asm liu et al 2019b 5 conclusions tree ring Œ¥18ocell contains local including temperature and humidity conditions and moisture sources signals we presented the foundation for a new method of extracting the local rh signal from Œ¥18ocell records to the greatest extent we found that 1 Œ¥18ocell responded to rh after removing the influence of temperature and Œ¥18os and provided a potential proxy to reconstruct rh 2 the reconstructed millennium rh record based on the new method revealed cycles of approximately 35 85 130 160 and 200 years consistent with local hydrothermal changes and are influenced by solar insolation variations pacific decadal oscillation and atlantic multidecadal variabilities 3 with continuous global warming rh values in the study region may further decrease as the contribution of temperature becomes greater than that of the precipitation credit authorship contribution statement yaling wu methodology validation formal analysis

2308,well fields along rivers withdrawing groundwater through riverbank filtration rbf are popular for urban water supply due to their good performance in assurance for both water quantity and quality however rbf sites are susceptible to flood inundation which has been found to cause increase of n fe and mn contents in groundwater and threatens water safety but the geochemical processes have not been fully understood to bridge this gap in situ monitoring of hydrodynamics hydrochemistry and stable isotopes for river water and groundwater were employed in a rbf site ne china to investigate into the geochemical processes in groundwater in rbf sites under long term inundation the results indicated that during long term inundation recharge from river water increased significantly and a large amount of o2 no3 and organic carbon oc from oxidizing river water could recharge far shore groundwater vertically whereas less nh4 were input from regional groundwater leading to a high content of no3 and low content of the nh4 in the groundwater meanwhile limited nh4 would be produced through dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra and mineralization of organic nitrogen mon moreover along the infiltration path aerobic respiration and denitrification dnf occurred rapidly co2 generated from oc oxidization in the two processes enhanced the dissolution of carbonate minerals which could be used to trace the oxidizing reducing o r interface between river water and groundwater as indicated the inundation can cause the o r interface which usually distributed near shore to extend to the entire well field during inundation in this situation the redox condition of groundwater used to be suitable for so4 2 reduction in non inundation period decreases to the level favoring the reduction of mn iv fe iii oxides during inundation and the process of fe2 precipitation by reacting with hs is weaken as the inhabitation of so4 2 reduction leading to a significant increase in fe2 mn2 and as contents putting well field groundwater at risk of contamination keywords rbf flood inundation hydrogeochemistry o r interface tracing data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction rbf is an important concept for utilization of groundwater providing a guarantee of both water quantity and quality for urban water supply tufenkji et al 2002 greskowiak et al 2006 farnsworth et al 2011 as the groundwater is usually of poor quality due to naturally occurred high contents of fe mn and as in the aquifer which are sensitive to redox conditions and nowadays a large scale application of nitrogen n fertilizer and manure in agriculture and discharge of municipal sewage has lead n entered into rivers and redox sensitive groundwater in rbf sites intensively the safety of water quality is under risk both have posed a major threat to the safety of water quality during the non inundation period when river continuously recharge groundwater horizontally groffman et al 2002 canfield et al 2010 zenagui et al 2020 moreover since most rbf sites are usually low lying they are susceptible to flood inundation in wet seasons inundation can cause significant changes in redox conditions of groundwater in rbf system ray et al 2002 eckert and irmscher 2006 sprenger et al 2011 ascott et al 2016 van driezum et al 2018 and kondrat eva andreeva 2018 have indicated that rbf is vulnerable to inundation and the groundwater is at risk to be polluted directly in fact flood inundation can change river water filtration and the redox condition of groundwater in rbf sites thus geochemical reactions controlled by water mixing and redox conditions such as removal of no3 and enrichment of nh4 in groundwater as well as releasing and precipitation of fe and mn in aquifers would be affected significantly burt et al 2002 massmann et al 2004 2006 2008 kumar et al 2012 ascott et al 2016 muz et al 2019 covatti and grischek 2021 in rbf sites groundwater is generally recharged by river water regional groundwater and local precipitation hiscock and grischek 2002 engelhardt et al 2011 su et al 2020 chen et al 2022a these recharges would change synchronously during flood inundation as the vadose zone becomes saturated the vertical recharge from precipitation will be substituted by river water vekerdy et al 1998 schubert 2002 malama et al 2010 van driezum et al 2018 with a much larger recharge flux induced by inundation and will dilute no3 in phreatic aquifers when no3 concentration of groundwater is higher than that of surface water weng et al 2003 more commonly as most rbf sites are characteristic of a reducing environment with high nh4 and low no3 contents the vertical recharge may also cause an increase in no3 ascott et al 2016 covatti and grischek 2021 meanwhile elevated level of groundwater in rbf sites would decrease the hydraulic gradient between the well field and the regional groundwater thus decrease the regional groundwater recharge usually with high load of nh4 fe2 and mn2 sprenger et al 2011 wett et al 2002 su et al 2020 as water isotopes Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o of river water and regional groundwater are significantly different they have been widely used as a tracer for the identification of mixing process in rbf sites burt et al 2002 n√©grel et al 2003 masse dufresne et al 2021 river water usually carries large amounts of dissolved oxygen do and organic carbon oc which are brought into the groundwater during filtration for rbf sites there usually form a stable horizontal redox zonation in near shore groundwater 0 30 m within the shore along river filtration path when there are no inundation events massmann et al 2004 2006 2008 rudolf et al 2014 burke et al 2014 henzler et al 2016 and oc is regarded as an electron donor playing essential role in sequential reduction of o2 no3 mn iv oxides fe iii oxides and so4 2 forming o r interfaces in rbf sites gandy et al 2007 kohfahl et al 2009 zhu et al 2020 in contrast during flood inundation period the river water covers the rbf sites is non hydrostatic but flows fast the o r interface would shift as well baldwin and mitchell 2000 williams et al 2000 figura et al 2013 this is different from hydrostatic inundation by precipitation or small fluctuation of river water level occurred far away from the river bank which usually forms lakes or wetlands with nearly stagnant surface water covering only part of the rbf sites where the concentration of do is generally low as has been gradually consumed from water surface vertically downward therefore under the condition of non hydrostatic inundation the o r interface extends to the entire area of the inundated site not limited to the near shore region the flowing river water maintains high concentrations of do oc and pollutants which are recharged continuously into the aquifer vertically ray et al 2002 sprenger et al 2011 ascott et al 2016 under this condition the sequential reduction zonation is no longer horizontal but in vertical direction accompanying river water filtration unfortunately researches focused on this issue are few mechanism of mixing and geochemical reactions around o r interface during rbf have provided the basis for further investigations i dnf and dnra occurred near the o r interface in rbf sites is the key mechanism for removal of no3 infiltrated with the oxidizing river water buzek et al 2012 trauth et al 2017 zhai et al 2017 silver et al 2018 upreti et al 2022 chen et al 2022a ii nh4 is usually originates from reducing regional groundwater dnra and mon of soil dhondt et al 2003 evans et al 2011 sgouridis et al 2011 gupta et al 2015 lewis et al 2021 chen et al 2022a iii fe2 and mn2 are controlled by reduction of fe iii and mn iv oxides in aquifer media as well as mixing petrunic et al 2005 gandy et al 2007 su et al 2020 and the consumption of oc and do no3 is an important factor affecting the migration of fe2 and mn2 in rbf sites by changing the redox conditions kedziorek and bourg 2009 diem et al 2013 henzler et al 2016 another important factor regulating fe2 in groundwater is reduction of so4 2 to hs which can cause precipitation of fe2 jakobsen and postma 1999 massmann et al 2006 2008 burke et al 2014 robertson et al 2016 however how do these reactions and the redox conditions change with the shift of the o r interface during inundation is still not clear needing further studies to bridge the knowledge gap of the geochemical and mixing processes controlling no3 nh4 mn and fe concentrations in groundwater in rbf sites during inundation the present research take a typical rbf site i e the kaladian well field ne china as a case study the groundwater there has been withdrawn for industrial and emergency domestic water supply the nh4 n fe2 and mn2 concentrations in the groundwater were 0 45 2 92 0 66 13 2 0 32 4 26 mg l respectively ren et al 2020 su et al 2020 chen et al 2022a mostly cannot meet the quality standard for drinking water with respect to who drinking water quality guidelines 0 5 2 0 and 0 4 mg l respectively moreover these indices are significantly higher during inundation than non inundation periods the well field subjects to non hydrostatic inundation every year according to the monitoring data between 2015 and 2021 the inundation lasted for at least 10 days and some year it reached up to 40 60 days therefore it is necessary to investigate the risks posed by flood inundation to groundwater quality which would provide a basis for optimizing rbf performance accordingly this study investigated the hydrodynamic and hydrochemistry processes during inundation and non inundation periods the main objectives of this work are as follows i to determine the hydrodynamic and recharge conditions during both inundation and non inundation periods based on monitoring of river water and groundwater level and water isotopes ii to analyze the variations in redox and acid base conditions of groundwater induced by inundation though investigation of hydrogeochemical parameters of river water and groundwater iii to identify the key mixing and biogeochemical processes controlling no3 nh4 fe2 and mn2 concentrations in groundwater during inundation period and iv to establish a conceptual model illustrating the effects of inundation on biogeochemical processes in groundwater during riverbank filtration 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the kaladian rbf well field is located in the alluvial plain of the lower second songhua river ne china fig 1 a the terrain is relatively flat and slopes gradually from the southeast to the northwest the elevation is 124 129 m a s l and less than 125 5 m in ca 70 of the area the second songhua river runs from southeast to northwest the well field is located on a river island to the left side of the main stream surrounded by the main stream and a tributary in total eight full year pumping wells are arranged along the river shore the cumulative yields of well c1 c8 is 6 000 10 000 m3 d the pumping facilities are arranged 3 m above the ground to ensure pumping safety during inundation the target aquifer for pumping is a phreatic aquifer with a total thickness of 17 21 m and can be divided into upper and lower parts which consists of fine sand and medium sand respectively with an average hydraulic conductivity k of 28 49 and 40 45 m d respectively fig 1b the aquifer is underlain by a continuous stable clay layer of ca 24 m in thickness the groundwater in the well field has a close hydraulic connection with the river water the groundwater is mainly recharged by the river water lateral regional groundwater and local precipitation the main discharge items are pumping and evaporation and a groundwater depression cone has formed with the long axis parallel to the river by long term pumping of the pumping wells moreover the well field comprises 24 groundwater monitoring wells numbered as o1 to o24 with depths of 8 10 m and screen lengths of 2 3 m fig 1a ren et al 2020 su et al 2020 chen et al 2022a the study area has a continental semi arid monsoon climate it is dry and windy in spring hot and rainy in summer cool in autumn with early frost and the winter is cold and long with a freezing period of ca 150 d the annual average temperature is 4 7 c the average temperature is 23 3 c in july and 17 5 c in january the annual average precipitation is 425 7 mm of which greater than 70 is concentrated in june to august while the evaporation is 1689 8 mm the river flow of the second songhua river is controlled by climate and upstream water conservancy projects the annual average runoff is 476 0 m3 s the width of the river water surface is 400 450 m and the water depth is 3 7 m in summer the water level often exceeds 125 m a s l leading to inundation of the river island and river shores 2 2 sampling and analysis field campaigns were conducted in january may august and november 2016 and january 2017 respectively the river water samples were collected 0 5 m below the water surface the groundwater was sampled after 3 times the volume of the well pipe was pumped to ensure that the groundwater retained in the well was removed the water samples were filtered with a 0 45 Œºm filter membrane and the sampling bottles were sealed with no air left in the headspace in particular concentrated sulfuric acid was added to the samples for nh4 testing to lower the ph to less than 2 while mn2 samples were collected with brown glass bottles and added with dilute hydrochloric acid to lower the ph to less than 2 and samples for water isotope analysis were collected with a 50 ml polyethylene bottle sealed and stored at 4 c the ph and do were measured with a portable multimeter hach hq40d hach company usa total fe and fe2 were measured in situ with a portable spectrophotometer hach dr1900 hach company usa mn2 was measured with an atomic absorption

netherlands hco3 was measured with the titration method the charge balance error for the major ions ranges from 10 to 10 water isotopes were measured with an isotope analyzer l2130 i picarro usa with a precision of 0 1 vsmow and 0 025 vsmow for Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of groundwater regime during inundation river rises in summer would put the rbf well fields at a high risk of being inundated this situation is more common where the precipitation is concentrated or the river flow is manually controlled in the upstream or downstream the groundwater level in the rbf well field usually responds to the change of the river level quickly under the condition of long term inundation the recharge scheme of river water to the groundwater would change significantly 3 1 1 dynamics of river water and groundwater in the non inundation period the water level fluctuated between 122 0 and 124 5 m a s l due to long term pumping of wells c1 c8 a stable cone of depression has formed in the river island the long axis of the cone was parallel to the river bank while the center was located near wells c5 and c6 fig 2 a however in the inundation period the river level could rise up to 125 5 m a s l which is higher than the land surface of most areas in the well field according to aerial photography 65 75 of the river island was inundated during the inundation period mainly in august 2016 lasting for ca 30 40 days fig 2b the direction of surface water runoff within the inundation area was consistent with that of the river flow with a velocity of 0 5 1 2 m s in the area outside the cone of depression the groundwater level in non inundation period varied between 121 and 124 m a s l while the thickness of the vadose zone varied between 2 5 and 3 2 m with a hydraulic gradient of 2 3 3 5 in contrast the groundwater level in the inundation period was 123 5 125 5 m i e 1 2 m higher than that in the non inundation period while the thickness of the vadose zone was generally less than 1 5 m the hydraulic gradient could reach up to 4 5 7 8 3 1 2 mixing processes during inundation river water and regional groundwater are two major recharge end members for the groundwater in the kaladian well field the isotopic composition of the two end members shows significant spatiotemporal variations as the second songhua river originates from the changbai mountains with an elevation reaches up to 2749 m the river water is depleted compared to local precipitation Œ¥d 80 96 to 78 84 whereas the regional groundwater is enriched Œ¥d 71 63 to 62 62 due to evaporation su et al 2020 chen et al 2022a the isotopic composition of the groundwater in the well field generally extends between the river water and regional groundwater fig 3 a and 3b indicating that the groundwater is affected by the long term mixing of the two end members engelhardt et al 2011 su et al 2020 in near shore groundwater wells o1 o5 o6 o8 o9 and o11 less than 10 m from the shore the isotopic composition of groundwater was close to the river water in both the non inundation and inundation periods fig 3a indicating that the near shore groundwater was mainly recharged by the river water all year round however in the far shore groundwater wells o4 o7 o10 o12 and o13 30 m away from the shore the isotopic composition of groundwater in the inundation period was more depleted compared to those in the non inundation period fig 3b the points were closer to the river water in the inundation period with respect to that in the non inundation period it s indicated that in the inundation period when 65 of the ground surface was inundated the river water would rapidly and directly recharge the well field groundwater vertically 3 2 variation of o r interface influenced by inundation during continuous rbf process in the non inundation period sequential reduction would occur and form a stable redox zonation as gibbs free energy required for o2 no3 mn iv fe iii and so4 2 reduction decreases table 1 these species would be reduced sequentially in groundwater leading to a more and more reducing environment massmann et al 2004 kohfahl et al 2009 diem et al 2013 su et al 2020 chen et al 2022a here the transition area from oxidizing river water to reducing groundwater favoring for so4 2 reduction is defined as o r interface 3 2 1 method for tracing o r interface during rbf in the o r interface do decreased quickly during river water infiltration in the well field it ranged from 0 5 to 1 1 mg l and 1 0 to 1 5 mg l in the non inundation and inundation periods respectively showing a wide overlap and restricting it from effectively indicating the change of the redox conditions do concentration can t be used to trace the redox condition of groundwater though it was usually thought as a good indicator of the redox condition since fe iii reduction is located in the middle of the sequential reduction chain table 1 fe2 fe3 ratio was expected to reflect the changes of the redox conditions either furthermore during sequential reduction processes river water provided abundant electron acceptors such as o2 and no3 then oc is believed to be the primary electron donor for all reactions facilitating the rapid oxidization of oc to co2 ray et al 2002 ascott et al 2016 van driezum et al 2018 wett et al 2002 subsequently the balance of carbonic acid was disrupted by the dissolution of the produced co2 facilitating the production of hco3 decrease of ph and dissolution of caco3 in the aquifer medium appelo 1994 kedziorek and bourg 2009 kohfahl et al 2009 baldwin et al 2010 recently researches has postulated that the decrease of ph usually occurs in rapid reductions of o2 and no3 at a zone within 0 3 5 m from the surface of the river bed and significantly influence the carbonate dissolution revsbech et al 2005 gardner et al 2006 massmann et al 2008 kohfahl et al 2009 kumar et al 2012 trauth et al 2017 su et al 2020 3 2 2 distribution of o r interface influenced by inundation the fe2 fe3 ratio of the near shore groundwater was 3 51 6 71 averaged 5 38 and 4 02 6 22 averaged 5 19 in the non inundation and inundation periods respectively fig 4 a indicating only small changes had occurred in the reducing environment i e the region within 50 m from the river bank is part of the o r interface in both inundation and non inundation periods in this region ph hco3 and ca2 contents changed slightly in different seasons fig 4b 4c and 4d which ranged from 6 85 to 7 83 mg l 95 2 to 263 4 mg l and 22 9 to 63 4 mg l respectively and were relatively lower than that of the far shore zone which were 6 95 7 93 115 5 396 7 mg l and 40 2 74 2 mg l respectively showing that groundwater inside the o r interface within 50 m away from the shore is more acidic in the far shore region between 50 and 800 m away from the river bank the redox state of the groundwater facilitates so4 2 reduction during the non inundation period the fe2 fe3 ratio ranged from 4 43 to 10 18 averaged 7 15 which was significantly higher than that in the inundation period 3 77 6 90 averaged 5 59 indicating during vertical filtration of the oxidizing river water in the inundation period the reducing environment suitable for so4 2 reduction of groundwater was significantly weakened and fe2 fe3 ratio and hco3 concentration were negatively correlated also confirm that fig 5 a wett et al 2002 massmann et al 2006 figura et al 2013 moreover the ph was 7 21 7 93 averaged 7 48 in the non inundation period higher than that in the inundation period 6 95 7 54 averaged 7 24 while the ca2 concentrations in the non inundation period were 40 2 68 7 mg l averaged 55 8 mg l lower than that in the inundation period 59 8 74 2 mg l averaged 66 2 mg l and there was a negative correlation between ca2 concentration and ph fig 5b indicating the activity of oc oxidation in far shore groundwater was significantly enhanced overall the o r interface between river water and groundwater extended from the near shore zone during non inundation period to the whole well field during inundation 3 3 redox level and biogeochemical reactions influenced by inundation river water characterized of an oxidizing environment showed a high content of no3 and so4 as well as low content of nh4 mn2 and fe2 approaching the detection limit which was reserved in the reducing environment of regional groundwater in most rbf sites groffman et al 2002 diem et al 2013 muz et al 2019 covatti and grischek 2021 no3 nh4 mn2 and fe2 concentration in the well field groundwater would be controlled by mixing and biogeochemical reactions schubert 2002 engelhardt et al 2011 silver et al 2018 chen et al 2022b these biogeochemical reactions include no3 removal through dnf and dnra nh4 enrichment through min and dnra increase of fe and mn through fe iii and mn iv reduction decrease of fe though fe2 precipitation etc during the mixing processes solutes would theoretically be mixed in a similar proportion regarding the relationship between conserved solutes and Œ¥18o the well field groundwater would fall on the mixing line of river water and regional groundwater burt et al 2002 n√©grel et al 2003 engelhardt et al 2011 masse dufresne et al 2021 however it often derivate from the mixing line influenced by biogeochemical reactions and the degree of deviation would vary according to the intensity of the reactions su et al 2020 chen et al 2022a 3 3 1 reducing level influenced by variation of o r interface massmann et al 2004 2006 greskowiak et al 2006 and su et al 2020 had demonstrated that the increasing trend of fe2 and mn2 usually indicates the end of no3 reduction zone whereas the decreasing trend of fe2 and mn2 indicates either an increase of o2 from vertical recharge or hs from so4 2 reduction therefore dynamics of fe2 and mn2 plays as a good indicator of the reducing level of groundwater spatially fe2 and mn2 contents in the near shore zone were 0 66 3 18 mg l and 0 32 2 74 mg l respectively both lower than those in the far shore zone 9 47 13 12 mg l and 2 17 4 26 mg l respectively showing the continuous recharge of fe2 and mn2 from fe iii and mn iv oxides reduction along the filtration flow path fig 6 a and 6b temporally contents of fe2 and mn2 in near shore groundwater changes little i e less than 20 in contrast fe2 and mn2 in far shore groundwater changes significantly in the non inundation period fe2 and mn2 ranges 8 38 10 55 mg l and 2 17 3 98 mg l respectively both lower than those in the inundation period 10 15 13 12 mg l and 2 86 4 26 mg l respectively thus both fe2 and mn2 concentrations in the far shore zone groundwater increased significantly under the influence of inundation when the o r interface expand to the whole well field moreover fe2 and mn2 concentrations were much higher above the mixing line in both inundation and non inundation periods fig 6c and 6d and were further away from the mixing line in the inundation period than that in the non inundation period which indicated that after the rapid reduction of o2 and no3 received from river water the reducing environment of groundwater increased to a level suitable for fe iii reduction leading to the reduction of fe iii and mn iv oxides during the inundation period sprenger et al 2011 ascott et al 2016 kondrat eva and andreeva 2018 su et al 2020 3 3 2 fe release and precipitating influenced by variation of o r interface in the non inundation period the reducing level of the far shore zone dropped to a level suitable for so4 2 reduction nitzsche et al 2015 henzler et al 2016 su et al 2020 resulting in the precipitation of hs with the produced fe2 formed by fe iii reduction reducing the concentration of fe2 in well field groundwater jakobsen and postma 1999 robertson et al 2016 due to inhibition of so4 2 reduction the formation of hs is inhibited too leading to more fe2 being retained in the groundwater which directly increased the contents of mn2 and fe2 fig 6 although very little fe2 may be oxidized by the vertically recharged no3 wells et al 2016 covatti and grischek 2021 moreover mn iv and fe iii reduction may also lead to the release of as in the iron manganese lattice in the aquifer medium nitzsche et al 2015 o day et al 2004 pedersen et al 2006 xia et al 2023 during the non inundation period the content of as is 0 012 0 104 mg l averaged 0 034 mg l whereas in inundation period it rises to 0 151 0 985 mg l averaged 0 412 mg l which increased by more than 10 folds these processes will pose threats to the groundwater quality in rbf well fields during influenced by inundation 3 3 3 no3 removal influenced by variation of o r interface the no3 originates from river water reduced gradually by dnf and dnra driving the removal of no3 from the rbf system through conversion to n2 or nh4 trauth et al 2017 rivett et al 2008 ib√°nhez and rocha 2017 rahman et al 2019 chen et al 2022a 2022b leading the change in no3 concentration was quite small in the near shore groundwater both in the non inundation and inundation periods fig 7 a showing that the concentration of no3 in groundwater was higher in the near shore zone 0 81 1 89 mg l than that in the far shore zone 0 36 1 80 mg l however in far shore groundwater that change in no3 concentration was significant larger when the o r interface changed no3 concentration in the far shore zone was 0 36 1 45 mg l averaged 0 83 mg l during non inundation period which was quite lower than that in the inundation period 0 65 1 78 mg l averaged 1 35 mg l the far shore groundwater distributed below the mixing line indicating the influence of no3 reduction fig 7c the no3 content of the far shore groundwater in the inundation period was closer to the theoretical mixing line as well as the river water indicating that a large flux of no3 several times higher than that in the inundation period recharged this no3 flux had exceeded the capacity of no3 reduction leading to a great increase in no3 content in well field groundwater during the inundation period indicating that oxidative substances i e no3 and o2 in river water can be strongly affected by the change of the o r interface and this effect will fast disappear during their rapid reduction processes 3 3 4 nh4 enrichment influenced by variation of o r interface the origin of nh4 in groundwater of rbf sites was complex including i dnra in the near shore groundwater ii min along the entire flow path and iii contribution from high nh4 regional groundwater through mixing silver et al 2018 elena and llu√≠s 2021 chen et al 2022b leading to nh4 concentration of far shore groundwater 0 98 2 92 mg l higher than the near shore groundwater 0 45 1 69 mg l fig 7b however there was no significant difference in nh4 concentration of the near shore groundwater between non inundation and inundation period indicating less influence to dnra in the inundation period however nh4 concentration of the far shore groundwater was obviously higher in the non inundation period 1 17 2 92 mg l averaged 2 07 mg l than that in the inundation period 0 98 1 81 mg l averaged 1 32 mg l indicating that the less recharge of regional groundwater in flood inundation period is the major factor moreover nh4 of well field groundwater in the two periods were slightly above the theoretical line of mixing with similar deviation fig 7d which could be attributed to the slow release of nh4 produced by min or dnra i min is mainly controlled by the organic c n ratio of the aquifer medium while the c n kept 7 1 8 2 through different periods which is not easily to be affected by inundation dhondt et al 2003 schimel and bennett 2004 evans et al 2011 elena and llu√≠s 2021 ii the dnra is mainly controlled by functional microorganisms and restricted environmental conditions i e strictly anaerobic higher carbon load higher temperature and lower ph diem et al 2013 lewis et al 2021 upreti et al 2022 chen et al 2022a which are not formed in short inundation times less than 30 d nh4 content of well field groundwater in the inundation period were slightly further from the regional groundwater indicating that under the transformation of the o r interface reductive substance i e nh4 is still mainly constrained by mixing of river water and regional groundwater around the o r interface 4 conclusions the results of this survey identified the effect of flood inundation on the geochemistry of groundwater in rbf sites it shows that the river island rbf well field is extremely vulnerable to long term flood inundation inundation of the rbf site can cause fundamental change in hydrodynamic regime which can significantly increase river recharge and provide abundant input of o2 and no3 to well field groundwater during inundation which leads to the extension of the o r interface from the near shore zone to the entire flow path and weaken the reducing level of the far shore groundwater facilitating aerobic respiration dnf and dnra occur around the narrow o r interface increasing the content of no3 n fe2 mn2 and as in well field groundwater fig 8 these processes will bring a risk on the quality of the well field groundwater therefore continuous monitoring of well field groundwater is necessary meanwhile measures for preventing the deterioration of the groundwater quality should be further studied as the study area is located in cold region the temperature of river water and groundwater has significant seasonal variations which would affect the geochemical flux between river water and groundwater and intensity of biogeochemical reactions thus the temperature effect should be studied further moreover metagenomic sequencing are necessary for future focus to investigate the structure and functioning of the microbial community mediating the biogeochemical reactions controlling n fe and mn etc credit

2308,well fields along rivers withdrawing groundwater through riverbank filtration rbf are popular for urban water supply due to their good performance in assurance for both water quantity and quality however rbf sites are susceptible to flood inundation which has been found to cause increase of n fe and mn contents in groundwater and threatens water safety but the geochemical processes have not been fully understood to bridge this gap in situ monitoring of hydrodynamics hydrochemistry and stable isotopes for river water and groundwater were employed in a rbf site ne china to investigate into the geochemical processes in groundwater in rbf sites under long term inundation the results indicated that during long term inundation recharge from river water increased significantly and a large amount of o2 no3 and organic carbon oc from oxidizing river water could recharge far shore groundwater vertically whereas less nh4 were input from regional groundwater leading to a high content of no3 and low content of the nh4 in the groundwater meanwhile limited nh4 would be produced through dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium dnra and mineralization of organic nitrogen mon moreover along the infiltration path aerobic respiration and denitrification dnf occurred rapidly co2 generated from oc oxidization in the two processes enhanced the dissolution of carbonate minerals which could be used to trace the oxidizing reducing o r interface between river water and groundwater as indicated the inundation can cause the o r interface which usually distributed near shore to extend to the entire well field during inundation in this situation the redox condition of groundwater used to be suitable for so4 2 reduction in non inundation period decreases to the level favoring the reduction of mn iv fe iii oxides during inundation and the process of fe2 precipitation by reacting with hs is weaken as the inhabitation of so4 2 reduction leading to a significant increase in fe2 mn2 and as contents putting well field groundwater at risk of contamination keywords rbf flood inundation hydrogeochemistry o r interface tracing data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction rbf is an important concept for utilization of groundwater providing a guarantee of both water quantity and quality for urban water supply tufenkji et al 2002 greskowiak et al 2006 farnsworth et al 2011 as the groundwater is usually of poor quality due to naturally occurred high contents of fe mn and as in the aquifer which are sensitive to redox conditions and nowadays a large scale application of nitrogen n fertilizer and manure in agriculture and discharge of municipal sewage has lead n entered into rivers and redox sensitive groundwater in rbf sites intensively the safety of water quality is under risk both have posed a major threat to the safety of water quality during the non inundation period when river continuously recharge groundwater horizontally groffman et al 2002 canfield et al 2010 zenagui et al 2020 moreover since most rbf sites are usually low lying they are susceptible to flood inundation in wet seasons inundation can cause significant changes in redox conditions of groundwater in rbf system ray et al 2002 eckert and irmscher 2006 sprenger et al 2011 ascott et al 2016 van driezum et al 2018 and kondrat eva andreeva 2018 have indicated that rbf is vulnerable to inundation and the groundwater is at risk to be polluted directly in fact flood inundation can change river water filtration and the redox condition of groundwater in rbf sites thus geochemical reactions controlled by water mixing and redox conditions such as removal of no3 and enrichment of nh4 in groundwater as well as releasing and precipitation of fe and mn in aquifers would be affected significantly burt et al 2002 massmann et al 2004 2006 2008 kumar et al 2012 ascott et al 2016 muz et al 2019 covatti and grischek 2021 in rbf sites groundwater is generally recharged by river water regional groundwater and local precipitation hiscock and grischek 2002 engelhardt et al 2011 su et al 2020 chen et al 2022a these recharges would change synchronously during flood inundation as the vadose zone becomes saturated the vertical recharge from precipitation will be substituted by river water vekerdy et al 1998 schubert 2002 malama et al 2010 van driezum et al 2018 with a much larger recharge flux induced by inundation and will dilute no3 in phreatic aquifers when no3 concentration of groundwater is higher than that of surface water weng et al 2003 more commonly as most rbf sites are characteristic of a reducing environment with high nh4 and low no3 contents the vertical recharge may also cause an increase in no3 ascott et al 2016 covatti and grischek 2021 meanwhile elevated level of groundwater in rbf sites would decrease the hydraulic gradient between the well field and the regional groundwater thus decrease the regional groundwater recharge usually with high load of nh4 fe2 and mn2 sprenger et al 2011 wett et al 2002 su et al 2020 as water isotopes Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o of river water and regional groundwater are significantly different they have been widely used as a tracer for the identification of mixing process in rbf sites burt et al 2002 n√©grel et al 2003 masse dufresne et al 2021 river water usually carries large amounts of dissolved oxygen do and organic carbon oc which are brought into the groundwater during filtration for rbf sites there usually form a stable horizontal redox zonation in near shore groundwater 0 30 m within the shore along river filtration path when there are no inundation events massmann et al 2004 2006 2008 rudolf et al 2014 burke et al 2014 henzler et al 2016 and oc is regarded as an electron donor playing essential role in sequential reduction of o2 no3 mn iv oxides fe iii oxides and so4 2 forming o r interfaces in rbf sites gandy et al 2007 kohfahl et al 2009 zhu et al 2020 in contrast during flood inundation period the river water covers the rbf sites is non hydrostatic but flows fast the o r interface would shift as well baldwin and mitchell 2000 williams et al 2000 figura et al 2013 this is different from hydrostatic inundation by precipitation or small fluctuation of river water level occurred far away from the river bank which usually forms lakes or wetlands with nearly stagnant surface water covering only part of the rbf sites where the concentration of do is generally low as has been gradually consumed from water surface vertically downward therefore under the condition of non hydrostatic inundation the o r interface extends to the entire area of the inundated site not limited to the near shore region the flowing river water maintains high concentrations of do oc and pollutants which are recharged continuously into the aquifer vertically ray et al 2002 sprenger et al 2011 ascott et al 2016 under this condition the sequential reduction zonation is no longer horizontal but in vertical direction accompanying river water filtration unfortunately researches focused on this issue are few mechanism of mixing and geochemical reactions around o r interface during rbf have provided the basis for further investigations i dnf and dnra occurred near the o r interface in rbf sites is the key mechanism for removal of no3 infiltrated with the oxidizing river water buzek et al 2012 trauth et al 2017 zhai et al 2017 silver et al 2018 upreti et al 2022 chen et al 2022a ii nh4 is usually originates from reducing regional groundwater dnra and mon of soil dhondt et al 2003 evans et al 2011 sgouridis et al 2011 gupta et al 2015 lewis et al 2021 chen et al 2022a iii fe2 and mn2 are controlled by reduction of fe iii and mn iv oxides in aquifer media as well as mixing petrunic et al 2005 gandy et al 2007 su et al 2020 and the consumption of oc and do no3 is an important factor affecting the migration of fe2 and mn2 in rbf sites by changing the redox conditions kedziorek and bourg 2009 diem et al 2013 henzler et al 2016 another important factor regulating fe2 in groundwater is reduction of so4 2 to hs which can cause precipitation of fe2 jakobsen and postma 1999 massmann et al 2006 2008 burke et al 2014 robertson et al 2016 however how do these reactions and the redox conditions change with the shift of the o r interface during inundation is still not clear needing further studies to bridge the knowledge gap of the geochemical and mixing processes controlling no3 nh4 mn and fe concentrations in groundwater in rbf sites during inundation the present research take a typical rbf site i e the kaladian well field ne china as a case study the groundwater there has been withdrawn for industrial and emergency domestic water supply the nh4 n fe2 and mn2 concentrations in the groundwater were 0 45 2 92 0 66 13 2 0 32 4 26 mg l respectively ren et al 2020 su et al 2020 chen et al 2022a mostly cannot meet the quality standard for drinking water with respect to who drinking water quality guidelines 0 5 2 0 and 0 4 mg l respectively moreover these indices are significantly higher during inundation than non inundation periods the well field subjects to non hydrostatic inundation every year according to the monitoring data between 2015 and 2021 the inundation lasted for at least 10 days and some year it reached up to 40 60 days therefore it is necessary to investigate the risks posed by flood inundation to groundwater quality which would provide a basis for optimizing rbf performance accordingly this study investigated the hydrodynamic and hydrochemistry processes during inundation and non inundation periods the main objectives of this work are as follows i to determine the hydrodynamic and recharge conditions during both inundation and non inundation periods based on monitoring of river water and groundwater level and water isotopes ii to analyze the variations in redox and acid base conditions of groundwater induced by inundation though investigation of hydrogeochemical parameters of river water and groundwater iii to identify the key mixing and biogeochemical processes controlling no3 nh4 fe2 and mn2 concentrations in groundwater during inundation period and iv to establish a conceptual model illustrating the effects of inundation on biogeochemical processes in groundwater during riverbank filtration 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the kaladian rbf well field is located in the alluvial plain of the lower second songhua river ne china fig 1 a the terrain is relatively flat and slopes gradually from the southeast to the northwest the elevation is 124 129 m a s l and less than 125 5 m in ca 70 of the area the second songhua river runs from southeast to northwest the well field is located on a river island to the left side of the main stream surrounded by the main stream and a tributary in total eight full year pumping wells are arranged along the river shore the cumulative yields of well c1 c8 is 6 000 10 000 m3 d the pumping facilities are arranged 3 m above the ground to ensure pumping safety during inundation the target aquifer for pumping is a phreatic aquifer with a total thickness of 17 21 m and can be divided into upper and lower parts which consists of fine sand and medium sand respectively with an average hydraulic conductivity k of 28 49 and 40 45 m d respectively fig 1b the aquifer is underlain by a continuous stable clay layer of ca 24 m in thickness the groundwater in the well field has a close hydraulic connection with the river water the groundwater is mainly recharged by the river water lateral regional groundwater and local precipitation the main discharge items are pumping and evaporation and a groundwater depression cone has formed with the long axis parallel to the river by long term pumping of the pumping wells moreover the well field comprises 24 groundwater monitoring wells numbered as o1 to o24 with depths of 8 10 m and screen lengths of 2 3 m fig 1a ren et al 2020 su et al 2020 chen et al 2022a the study area has a continental semi arid monsoon climate it is dry and windy in spring hot and rainy in summer cool in autumn with early frost and the winter is cold and long with a freezing period of ca 150 d the annual average temperature is 4 7 c the average temperature is 23 3 c in july and 17 5 c in january the annual average precipitation is 425 7 mm of which greater than 70 is concentrated in june to august while the evaporation is 1689 8 mm the river flow of the second songhua river is controlled by climate and upstream water conservancy projects the annual average runoff is 476 0 m3 s the width of the river water surface is 400 450 m and the water depth is 3 7 m in summer the water level often exceeds 125 m a s l leading to inundation of the river island and river shores 2 2 sampling and analysis field campaigns were conducted in january may august and november 2016 and january 2017 respectively the river water samples were collected 0 5 m below the water surface the groundwater was sampled after 3 times the volume of the well pipe was pumped to ensure that the groundwater retained in the well was removed the water samples were filtered with a 0 45 Œºm filter membrane and the sampling bottles were sealed with no air left in the headspace in particular concentrated sulfuric acid was added to the samples for nh4 testing to lower the ph to less than 2 while mn2 samples were collected with brown glass bottles and added with dilute hydrochloric acid to lower the ph to less than 2 and samples for water isotope analysis were collected with a 50 ml polyethylene bottle sealed and stored at 4 c the ph and do were measured with a portable multimeter hach hq40d hach company usa total fe and fe2 were measured in situ with a portable spectrophotometer hach dr1900 hach company usa mn2 was measured with an atomic absorption spectrometer scientific ice 3300 thermo germany ca2 was measured with an ion chromatography 881 compact ic pro metrohm switzerland no3 and nh4 were measured with a continuous flow analyzer san skalar netherlands hco3 was measured with the titration method the charge balance error for the major ions ranges from 10 to 10 water isotopes were measured with an isotope analyzer l2130 i picarro usa with a precision of 0 1 vsmow and 0 025 vsmow for Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of groundwater regime during inundation river rises in summer would put the rbf well fields at a high risk of being inundated this situation is more common where the precipitation is concentrated or the river flow is manually controlled in the upstream or downstream the groundwater level in the rbf well field usually responds to the change of the river level quickly under the condition of long term inundation the recharge scheme of river water to the groundwater would change significantly 3 1 1 dynamics of river water and groundwater in the non inundation period the water level fluctuated between 122 0 and 124 5 m a s l due to long term pumping of wells c1 c8 a stable cone of depression has formed in the river island the long axis of the cone was parallel to the river bank while the center was located near wells c5 and c6 fig 2 a however in the inundation period the river level could rise up to 125 5 m a s l which is higher than the land surface of most areas in the well field according to aerial photography 65 75 of the river island was inundated during the inundation period mainly in august 2016 lasting for ca 30 40 days fig 2b the direction of surface water runoff within the inundation area was consistent with that of the river flow with a velocity of 0 5 1 2 m s in the area outside the cone of depression the groundwater level in non inundation period varied between 121 and 124 m a s l while the thickness of the vadose zone varied between 2 5 and 3 2 m with a hydraulic gradient of 2 3 3 5 in contrast the groundwater level in the inundation period was 123 5 125 5 m i e 1 2 m higher than that in the non inundation period while the thickness of the vadose zone was generally less than 1 5 m the hydraulic gradient could reach up to 4 5 7 8 3 1 2 mixing processes during inundation river water and regional groundwater are two major recharge end members for the groundwater in the kaladian well field the isotopic composition of the two end members shows significant spatiotemporal variations as the second songhua river originates from the changbai mountains with an elevation reaches up to 2749 m the river water is depleted compared to local precipitation Œ¥d 80 96 to 78 84 whereas the regional groundwater is enriched Œ¥d 71 63 to 62 62 due to evaporation su et al 2020 chen et al 2022a the isotopic composition of the groundwater in the well field generally extends between the river water and regional groundwater fig 3 a and 3b indicating that the groundwater is affected by the long term mixing of the two end members engelhardt et al 2011 su et al 2020 in near shore groundwater wells o1 o5 o6 o8 o9 and o11 less than 10 m from the shore the isotopic composition of groundwater was close to the river water in both the non inundation and inundation periods fig 3a indicating that the near shore groundwater was mainly recharged by the river water all year round however in the far shore groundwater wells o4 o7 o10 o12 and o13 30 m away from the shore the isotopic composition of groundwater in the inundation period was more depleted compared to those in the non inundation period fig 3b the points were closer to the river water in the inundation period with respect to that in the non inundation period it s indicated that in the inundation period when 65 of the ground surface was inundated the river water would rapidly and directly recharge the well field groundwater vertically 3 2 variation of o r interface influenced by inundation during continuous rbf process in the non inundation period sequential reduction would occur and form a stable redox zonation as gibbs free energy required for o2 no3 mn iv fe iii and so4 2 reduction decreases table 1 these species would be reduced sequentially in groundwater leading to a more and more reducing environment massmann et al 2004 kohfahl et al 2009 diem et al 2013 su et al 2020 chen et al 2022a here the transition area from oxidizing river water to reducing groundwater favoring for so4 2 reduction is defined as o r interface 3 2 1 method for tracing o r interface during rbf in the o r interface do decreased quickly during river water infiltration in the well field it ranged from 0 5 to 1 1 mg l and 1 0 to 1 5 mg l in the non inundation and inundation periods respectively showing a wide overlap and restricting it from effectively indicating the change of the redox conditions do concentration can t be used to trace the redox condition of groundwater though it was usually thought as a good indicator of the redox condition since fe iii reduction is located in the middle of the sequential reduction chain table 1 fe2 fe3 ratio was expected to reflect the changes of the redox conditions either furthermore during sequential reduction processes river water provided abundant electron acceptors such as o2 and no3 then oc is believed to be the primary electron donor for all reactions facilitating the rapid oxidization of oc to co2 ray et al 2002 ascott et al 2016 van driezum et al 2018 wett et al 2002 subsequently the balance of carbonic acid was disrupted by the dissolution of the produced co2 facilitating the production of hco3 decrease of ph and dissolution of caco3 in the aquifer medium appelo 1994 kedziorek and bourg 2009 kohfahl et al 2009 baldwin et al 2010 recently researches has postulated that the decrease of ph usually occurs in rapid reductions of o2 and no3 at a zone within 0 3 5 m from the surface of the river bed and significantly influence the carbonate dissolution revsbech et al 2005 gardner et al 2006 massmann et al 2008 kohfahl et al 2009 kumar et al 2012 trauth et al 2017 su et al 2020 3 2 2 distribution of o r interface influenced by inundation the fe2 fe3 ratio of the near shore groundwater was 3 51 6 71 averaged 5 38 and 4 02 6 22 averaged 5 19 in the non inundation and inundation periods respectively fig 4 a indicating only small changes had occurred in the reducing environment i e the region within 50 m from the river bank is part of the o r interface in both inundation and non inundation periods in this region ph hco3 and ca2 contents changed slightly in different seasons fig 4b 4c and 4d which ranged from 6 85 to 7 83 mg l 95 2 to 263 4 mg l and 22 9 to 63 4 mg l respectively and were relatively lower than that of the far shore zone which were 6 95 7 93 115 5 396 7 mg l and 40 2 74 2 mg l respectively showing that groundwater inside the o r interface within 50 m away from the shore is more acidic in the far shore region between 50 and 800 m away from the river bank the redox state of the groundwater facilitates so4 2 reduction during the non inundation period the fe2 fe3 ratio ranged from 4 43 to 10 18 averaged 7 15 which was significantly higher than that in the inundation period 3 77 6 90 averaged 5 59 indicating during vertical filtration of the oxidizing river water in the inundation period the reducing environment suitable for so4 2 reduction of groundwater was significantly weakened and fe2 fe3 ratio and hco3 concentration were negatively correlated also confirm that fig 5 a wett et al 2002 massmann et al 2006 figura et al 2013 moreover the ph was 7 21 7 93 averaged 7 48 in the non inundation period higher than that in the inundation period 6 95 7 54 averaged 7 24 while the ca2 concentrations in the non inundation period were 40 2 68 7 mg l averaged 55 8 mg l lower than that in the inundation period 59 8 74 2 mg l averaged 66 2 mg l and there was a negative correlation between ca2 concentration and ph fig 5b indicating the activity of oc oxidation in far shore groundwater was significantly enhanced overall the o r interface between river water and groundwater extended from the near shore zone during non inundation period to the whole well field during inundation 3 3 redox level and biogeochemical reactions influenced by inundation river water characterized of an oxidizing environment showed a high content of no3 and so4 as well as low content of nh4 mn2 and fe2 approaching the detection limit which was reserved in the reducing environment of regional groundwater in most rbf sites groffman et al 2002 diem et al 2013 muz et al 2019 covatti and grischek 2021 no3 nh4 mn2 and fe2 concentration in the well field groundwater would be controlled by mixing and biogeochemical reactions schubert 2002 engelhardt et al 2011 silver et al 2018 chen et al 2022b these biogeochemical reactions include no3 removal through dnf and dnra nh4 enrichment through min and dnra increase of fe and mn through fe iii and mn iv reduction decrease of fe though fe2 precipitation etc during the mixing processes solutes would theoretically be mixed in a similar proportion regarding the relationship between conserved solutes and Œ¥18o the well field groundwater would fall on the mixing line of river water and regional groundwater burt et al 2002 n√©grel et al 2003 engelhardt et al 2011 masse dufresne et al 2021 however it often derivate from the mixing line influenced by biogeochemical reactions and the degree of deviation would vary according to the intensity of the reactions su et al 2020 chen et al 2022a 3 3 1 reducing level influenced by variation of o r interface massmann et al 2004 2006 greskowiak et al 2006 and su et al 2020 had demonstrated that the increasing trend of fe2 and mn2 usually indicates the end of no3 reduction zone whereas the decreasing trend of fe2 and mn2 indicates either an increase of o2 from vertical recharge or hs from so4 2 reduction therefore dynamics of fe2 and mn2 plays as a good indicator of the reducing level of groundwater spatially fe2 and mn2 contents in the near shore zone were 0 66 3 18 mg l and 0 32 2 74 mg l respectively both lower than those in the far shore zone 9 47 13 12 mg l and 2 17 4 26 mg l respectively showing the continuous recharge of fe2 and mn2 from fe iii and mn iv oxides reduction along the filtration flow path fig 6 a and 6b temporally contents of fe2 and mn2 in near shore groundwater changes little i e less than 20 in contrast fe2 and mn2 in far shore groundwater changes significantly in the non inundation period fe2 and mn2 ranges 8 38 10 55 mg l and 2 17 3 98 mg l respectively both lower than those in the inundation period 10 15 13 12 mg l and 2 86 4 26 mg l respectively thus both fe2 and mn2 concentrations in the far shore zone groundwater increased significantly under the influence of inundation when the o r interface expand to the whole well field moreover fe2 and mn2 concentrations were much higher above the mixing line in both inundation and non inundation periods fig 6c and 6d and were further away from the mixing line in the inundation period than that in the non inundation period which indicated that after the rapid reduction of o2 and no3 received from river water the reducing environment of groundwater increased to a level suitable for fe iii reduction leading to the reduction of fe iii and mn iv oxides during the inundation period sprenger et al 2011 ascott et al 2016 kondrat eva and andreeva 2018 su et al 2020 3 3 2 fe release and precipitating influenced by variation of o r interface in the non inundation period the reducing level of the far shore zone dropped to a level suitable for so4 2 reduction nitzsche et al 2015 henzler et al 2016 su et al 2020 resulting in the precipitation of hs with the produced fe2 formed by fe iii reduction reducing the concentration of fe2 in well field groundwater jakobsen and postma 1999 robertson et al 2016 due to inhibition of so4 2 reduction the formation of hs is inhibited too leading to more fe2 being retained in the groundwater which directly increased the contents of mn2 and fe2 fig 6 although very little fe2 may be oxidized by the vertically recharged no3 wells et al 2016 covatti and grischek 2021 moreover mn iv and fe iii reduction may also lead to the release of as in the iron manganese lattice in the aquifer medium nitzsche et al 2015 o day et al 2004 pedersen et al 2006 xia et al 2023 during the non inundation period the content of as is 0 012 0 104 mg l averaged 0 034 mg l whereas in inundation period it rises to 0 151 0 985 mg l averaged 0 412 mg l which increased by more than 10 folds these processes will pose threats to the groundwater quality in rbf well fields during influenced by inundation 3 3 3 no3 removal influenced by variation of o r interface the no3 originates from river water reduced gradually by dnf and dnra driving the removal of no3 from the rbf system through conversion to n2 or nh4 trauth et al 2017 rivett et al 2008 ib√°nhez and rocha 2017 rahman et al 2019 chen et al 2022a 2022b leading the change in no3 concentration was quite small in the near shore groundwater both in the non inundation and inundation periods fig 7 a showing that the concentration of no3 in groundwater was higher in the near shore zone 0 81 1 89 mg l than that in the far shore zone 0 36 1 80 mg l however in far shore groundwater that change in no3 concentration was significant larger when the o r interface changed no3 concentration in the far shore zone was 0 36 1 45 mg l averaged 0 83 mg l during non inundation period which was quite lower than that in the inundation period 0 65 1 78 mg l averaged 1 35 mg l the far shore groundwater distributed below the mixing line indicating the influence of no3 reduction fig 7c the no3 content of the far shore groundwater in the inundation period was closer to the theoretical mixing line as well as the river water indicating that a large flux of no3 several times higher than that in the inundation period recharged this no3 flux had exceeded the capacity of no3 reduction leading to a great increase in no3 content in well field groundwater during the inundation period indicating that oxidative substances i e no3 and o2 in river water can be strongly affected by the change of the o r interface and this effect will fast disappear during their rapid reduction processes 3 3 4 nh4 enrichment influenced by variation of o r interface the origin of nh4 in groundwater of rbf sites was complex including i dnra in the near shore groundwater ii min along the entire flow path and iii contribution from high nh4 regional groundwater through mixing silver et al 2018 elena and llu√≠s 2021 chen et al 2022b leading to nh4 concentration of far shore groundwater 0 98 2 92 mg l higher than the near shore groundwater 0 45 1 69 mg l fig 7b however there was no significant difference in nh4 concentration of the near shore groundwater between non inundation and inundation period indicating less influence to dnra in the inundation period however nh4 concentration of the far shore groundwater was obviously higher in the non inundation period 1 17 2 92 mg l averaged 2 07 mg l than that in the inundation period 0 98 1 81 mg l averaged 1 32 mg l indicating that the less recharge of regional groundwater in flood inundation period is the major factor moreover nh4 of well field groundwater in the two periods were slightly above the theoretical line of mixing with similar deviation fig 7d which could be attributed to the slow release of nh4 produced by min or dnra i min is mainly controlled by the organic c n ratio of the aquifer medium while the c n kept 7 1 8 2 through different periods which is not easily to be affected by inundation dhondt et al 2003 schimel and bennett 2004 evans et al 2011 elena and llu√≠s 2021 ii the dnra is mainly controlled by functional microorganisms and restricted environmental conditions i e strictly anaerobic higher carbon load higher temperature and lower ph diem et al 2013 lewis et al 2021 upreti et al 2022 chen et al 2022a which are not formed in short inundation times less than 30 d nh4 content of well field groundwater in the inundation period were slightly further from the regional groundwater indicating that under the transformation of the o r interface reductive substance i e nh4 is still mainly constrained by mixing of river water and regional groundwater around the o r interface 4 conclusions the results of this survey identified the effect of flood inundation on the geochemistry of groundwater in rbf sites it shows that the river island rbf well field is extremely vulnerable to long term flood inundation inundation of the rbf site can cause fundamental change in hydrodynamic regime which can significantly increase river recharge and provide abundant input of o2 and no3 to well field groundwater during inundation which leads to the extension of the o r interface from the near shore zone to the entire flow path and weaken the reducing level of the far shore groundwater facilitating aerobic respiration dnf and dnra occur around the narrow o r interface increasing the content of no3 n fe2 mn2 and as in well field groundwater fig 8 these processes will bring a risk on the quality of the well field groundwater therefore continuous monitoring of well field groundwater is necessary meanwhile measures for preventing the deterioration of the groundwater quality should be further studied as the study area is located in cold region the temperature of river water and groundwater has significant seasonal variations which would affect the geochemical flux between river water and groundwater and intensity of biogeochemical reactions thus the temperature effect should be studied further moreover metagenomic sequencing are necessary for future focus to investigate the structure and functioning of the microbial community mediating the biogeochemical reactions controlling n fe and mn etc credit

2309,rain on snow ros events can accelerate snow melting which in turn leads to disasters such as floods avalanches and landslides however little is known about the characteristics of and changes in ros events in china in this study the temporal and spatial variations of ros days in china from 2001 to 2018 were investigated using the improved moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer snow cover data and china meteorological forcing dataset the results suggested that ros days in china mainly occurred from november to june and were mainly distributed in northern xinjiang 6 1 days year qinghai tibet plateau 2 8 days year northeast china 3 5 days year and east china 1 1 days year ros days in each region have different seasonal distribution patterns in the past 18 years ros days have shown a trend of increasing at higher latitudes and decreasing at lower latitudes in china especially in northern xinjiang and the qinghai tibet plateau ros days are decreasing below 3000 m in northern xinjiang 0 16 days year and below 4000 m in the qinghai tibet plateau 0 21 days year which is explained by the decrease of snow days and rain days ros days are increasing at 3000 4000 m altitudes 0 15 days year in the tianshan mountains and 4000 5500 m altitudes 0 06 days year in the eastern tibetan mountains mainly explained by more snowfall converted to rainfall the ros days along the greater khingan mountains in northeast china showed a decreasing trend 0 12 days year and along the changbai mountains showed an increasing trend 0 07 days year the variation of snow cover days is the dominant factor east china as a whole shows a decreasing trend 0 1 days year explained by a decrease in snow cover time in china ros days at low altitudes are negatively correlated with annual average temperature and positively at high altitudes the changes of ros were also correlated with arctic oscillation and north atlantic oscillation this study reveals the response of ros to climate change in china and provides an important reference for coping with the related disasters and changes caused by ros events keywords rain on snow events change pattern rainfall snow snowfall rainfall ratio china data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction rainfall during the snow cover period is known as a rain on snow ros event ohba and kawase 2020 ros events are more complex hydrological phenomena than extreme rainfall events huang et al 2021 and can have extreme effects such as accelerating melting of snow eiriksson et al 2013 singh et al 1997 which in turn can lead to disasters such as floods avalanches and landslides harr 1981 marks et al 2015 stimberis and rubin 2011 for example in february 2017 the oroville dam in california collapsed due to extreme ros events resulting in the evacuation of approximately 190 000 people vahedifard et al 2017 in the long run the heat released by rainfall will accelerate the warming of snow cover making it more susceptible to later rainfall rennert et al 2009 then the accumulated rainfall and snowmelt water on the soil surface will release heat to accelerate permafrost thawing rennert et al 2009 which in turn can accelerate the release of soil carbon into the atmosphere in the form of dissolved organic matter or gas hobbie et al 2000 in addition surface ice formed by rain hinders the growth of vegetation and foraging of ungulates berger et al 2018 putkonen and roe 2003 therefore it is critical to study the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of ros and evaluate the response process of ros events under climate change for snowmelt disasters and ecological processes because ros events mainly occur in high altitude mountainous areas with complex terrain and few monitoring sites it is difficult to capture the exact process of ros events therefore at present most studies on the temporal and spatial changes in ros events use the number of ros days generally defined as rainfall and snow cover in a single day exceeding a certain threshold e g rainfall snow cover snow depth and snow water equivalent swe pall et al 2018 other studies use the phase changes of the snow surface detected by microwave remote sensing data to establish indicators such as snow surface humidity and thresholds dolant et al 2016 langlois et al 2017 pan et al 2018 these thresholds are often related to the characteristics of the study area and the purpose of the study the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics of ros days and their changes in response to climate warming have been investigated using observational data lu et al 2021 mccabe et al 2007 mor√°n tejeda et al 2017 pradhanang et al 2013 ye et al 2008 reanalysis data bieniek et al 2018 jeong and sushama 2018 and model simulation l√≥pez moreno et al 2021 musselman et al 2018 ohba and kawase 2020 pall et al 2018 mccabe et al 2007 revealed the spatial pattern and seasonal characteristics of ros days in the western united states using meteorological station data which suggested that the trends in ros event frequency are generally positive for high altitude sites and negative for low altitude sites further increasing temperature appears to be a contributing factor to this trend musselman et al 2018 used the weather research and forecasting wrf model and a land surface model to simulate future changes in ros days in western north america and found that ros events became less frequent at lower altitudes due to reduced snow cover under warmer climate conditions in contrast ros events became more frequent at higher altitudes due to the shift from snow to rain in regions of persistent seasonal snow cover using data from meteorological stations ye et al 2008 found that in europe and russia ros mostly occurred in winter and the number of ros days increased mainly due to increases in the number of rainfall days while air temperature is the main cause of these changes the north atlantic oscillation has some influence on ros and rainfall in northern europe and northern russia pall et al 2018 simulated the temporal and spatial characteristics of ros days in norway using a hydrological model and suggested that winter spring ros events broadly correlate with the north atlantic oscillation while the scandinavia pattern more strongly correlates with the arctic oscillation using remote sensing information from the advanced microwave scanning radiometer sensors amsr e pan et al 2018 found that the frequency and extent of wet snow and ros events increased at high latitudes with increasing temperature especially in southwestern and inland alaska using regional model simulations ohba et al 2020 suggested that ros events in the mountains of hokuriku japan will increase in the future these studies suggested that ros exhibits strong regional patterns with varying driving forces indicating that in depth research on ros changes and their effects in different regions is needed cold regions account for 43 5 of the land area of china chen et al 2006 and rain snow mixed floods have increased in frequency in recent years chen et al 2021 however the spatial distribution frequency and variation of ros in china have rarely been reported accessible in situ observation sites for analyzing ros changes in high altitude mountainous areas are limited and thus some local changes may be missed using this method melgar and meza 2020 however there are also large uncertainties in the extraction of ros events by monitoring the snow surface state by microwave remote sensing because the driving factor for the phase change of snow state is not limited to rainfall events and the spatial resolution of the snow depth obtained by microwave remote sensing is relatively coarse such as amsr e 0 25 which makes it difficult to reflect changes in snow cover with varying terrain wang et al 2016 the evolution of snow cover simulated by hydrological or land surface models is coarse and it is difficult to reflect the complex snow cover distribution with varying terrain guo et al 2021 toure et al 2018 indeed the spatial distribution and frequency of ros days simulated by different models in the same area are varied bieniek et al 2018 pan et al 2018 with the development of remote sensing technology satellite missions including the tropical rainfall measurement mission trmm and the global precipitation measurement gpm mission have acquired large scale and continuous precipitation data battaglia et al 2020 some reanalysis data such as era5 hersbach et al 2020 cfsr sorrel 2010 and cmip5 taylor et al 2011 are also produced and widely used at the same time data assimilation technology based on multi source data has also developed rapidly for example the china meteorological forcing dataset he et al 2020 was made through fusion of remote sensing products reanalysis datasets and in situ station data these multi source fusion data provides a strong support for us to better understand the temperature and precipitation patterns in data scarce areas in snow information acquisition remote sensing research for snow information extraction snow mapping snow depth calculation snow water equivalent estimation and other snow parameter inversions has developed rapidly and a large number of remote sensing snow products have been produced and verified wang et al 2016 therefore we combined improved moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis snow cover and china meteorological forcing dataset cmfd to extract ros days in china we investigated the spatial distribution of ros at different altitude intervals on a 500 m grid and the change patterns and mechanisms of ros the remainder of the paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the data and methods section 3 discusses the distribution and change patterns of ros events in china and section 4 discusses the relationship between ros and temperature rise arctic oscillation index aoi north atlantic oscillation index naoi and oceanic ni√±o index oni as well as limitations and future work 2 data and methods 2 1 study area the study area of this study is mainland china fig 1 china is located in the west coast of the pacific ocean eastern eurasia climate is complex and diverse china s terrain is high in the west and low in the east roughly stepped distribution the terrain of high in the west and low in the east is conducive to the warm and humid airflow of the pacific ocean penetrating into the inland area the cold air in the north can drive southward for a long time which makes it easy to form abundant precipitation in the southeast the northwest region is deep inland far from the sea and is more affected by the terrain the precipitation generally decreases from southeast to northwest china s total snow cover area is as high as 9 million square kilometers and the stable season snow cover area reaches 4 2 million square kilometers li and mi 1983 the main areas are the qinghai tibet plateau northeast china northern and western xinjiang northern and eastern inner mongolia 2 2 modis daily cloudless snow cover dataset the recent modis daily cloudless snow cover dataset gao et al 2019 is based on the modis reflectance product mod myd09ga and developed a multi index combined snow cover discrimination algorithm under different land cover types simultaneously the hidden markov algorithm and multi source data fusion method were used to realize the complete cloud free acquisition of the product the validation against 362 china meteorological administration cma stations shows that during snow seasons the overall accuracy oa values of the datasets are larger than 93 the omission error oe values are constrained within 9 the commission error ce values are constrained within 10 bias values of 1 02 demonstrate on a whole that there is no significant overestimation nor a significant underestimation hao et al 2022 based on the same ground reference data the new product accuracies are obviously higher than standard modis snow products therefore this dataset has virtually provided more reliable snow knowledge over china thereby using this dataset instead of the initial modis snow cover product can improve the accuracy of ros identification more information about this dataset can be found in hao et al 2022 data were obtained from the national glacier and permafrost science data center https sdb casnw net portal 2 3 the china meteorological forcing dataset the cmfd he et al 2020 is the first high spatial temporal resolution gridded near surface meteorological dataset developed specifically for studying land surface processes in china the dataset was created through the fusion of remote sensing products reanalysis datasets and in situ observation data it includes data from january 1979 and is ongoing currently up to december 2018 with a temporal resolution of three hours and a spatial resolution of 0 1 data on seven near surface meteorological elements are provided in the cmfd including 2 meter air temperature surface pressure specific humidity 10 meter wind speed downward shortwave radiation downward longwave radiation and precipitation rate validations against observations measured at independent stations show that the cmfd is of superior quality than the global land data assimilation system gldas because a larger number of stations are used to generate the cmfd than are used in the gldas owing to its continuous temporal coverage and consistent quality the cmfd is one of the most widely used climate datasets in china he et al 2020 has many studies du et al 2022 he et al 2021 li et al 2022a yan et al 2021 yang et al 2021 zhang et al 2022 evaluated the accuracy of the cmfd and other products and found that the data provided by the cmfd have higher accuracy than those from other products in china this study mainly uses three elements of daily precipitation daily temperature and daily specific humidity in the cmfd from 2001 to 2018 daily precipitation is used to extract rain days daily temperature and daily specific humidity are used to calculate the type of precipitation 2 4 downscaling of cmfd in this study the spatial resolution of precipitation air temperature and specific humidity data was 10 km while that of snow cover data was 500 m however ros is determined by precipitation temperature and snow cover and its changes are strongly correlated with topographic in order to analyze the variation of ros with terrain the daily precipitation daily temperature and daily specific humidity data of cmfd were downscaled to 500 m by terrain correction however the gradient varies in different regions and seasons therefore we define the gradient considering the spatiotemporal variation for air temperature firstly the monthly average temperature is calculated by cmfd temperature data from 2001 to 2018 secondly a sliding window of 5x5 size is defined and the gradient of the target grid is calculated from the temperature and elevation data of the nearest 21 cells in order to ensure the consistency of the data the 0 1 resolution dem provided by cmfd is used to obtain elevation for each cell the monthly gradient is calculated in the same way which means that each cell of 0 1 has its own gradient and changes with the month fig 2 a shows the gradient of march temperature in china calculated by sliding window finally we use a 500 m dem resampled by 30 m aster gdem v2 data tachikawa et al 2011 to obtain a 500 m temperature by gradient correction fig 3 shows the cmfd daily temperature a and downscaled cmfd daily temperature b in the east tianshan area on january 1 2001 for precipitation we use the same way as the temperature to get the monthly precipitaion gradient fig 2b shows the gradient of may precipitation in china calculated by sliding window however for precipitation data it is necessary to correct the outliers caused by downscaling e g rainfall 0 or extremely heavy rainfall therefore the correction of rainfall defines a relatively conservative interval for daily precipitation we define a 3 3 sliding window to find the maximum and minimum precipitation from the nine nearest grids of the target grid which is the range that the target grid can be corrected this can avoid the abnormal value of precipitation during downscaling and ensure the continuity of rainfall with terrain changes in space fig 3 shows the cmfd daily precipitation c and downscaled cmfd daily precipitation d in east tianshan on may 19 2001 for specific humidity we downscale it in the same way as the temperature similarly using terrain correction for specific humidity also results in outliers however because we use relative humidity when judging the type of precipitation we need to convert specific humidity to relative humidity and the range of relative humidity is 0 to 1 we assign the value less than 0 to 0 and the value greater than 1 to 1 through this correction a reasonable relative humidity is obtained and the outliers caused by specific humidity in downscaling are corrected 2 5 identification of precipitation types the difficulty in extracting ros days lies in distinguishing the types of precipitation which largely affects the accuracy of temporal and spatial changes in ros this is because many precipitation datasets cannot identify precipitation type in most field or small watershed studies rain and snow are often separated using the temperature threshold which varies according to the study area most hydrological models such as swat soil and water assessment tool vic variable infiltration capacity model also use this strategy however many studies ding et al 2014 jennings et al 2018 sun et al 2022 ye et al 2013 have shown that the method of precipitation type division combined with relative humidity is superior to the strategy of only considering temperature ding et al 2014 developed a new scheme to distinguish precipitation types based on more than 400 000 precipitation type samples collected from different climatic conditions and altitudes in china this method can calculate the corresponding precipitation type by inputting wet bulb temperature relative humidity and elevation studies ding et al 2014 sun et al 2022 have shown that the ding method shows high accuracy in distinguishing precipitation types in china therefore in this study we used the ding method to determine the type of precipitation two threshold temperatures tmin and tmax were defined in this method so that the precipitation type is determined by the following factors type snow t w t m i n s l e e t t m i n t w t m a x r a i n t w t m a x tw is the daily wet bulb temperature and tmin and tmax are two threshold temperatures that depend on relative humidity and elevation the calculation of tw tmin and tmax can be found in ding et al 2014 2 6 definition of ros day in previous studies bieniek et al 2018 jeong and sushama 2018 lu et al 2021 mccabe et al 2007 musselman et al 2018 ohba and kawase 2020 pall et al 2018 pradhanang et al 2013 ye et al 2008 ros days were usually defined as a day with both snow cover and rainfall however the thresholds of snow cover and rainfall differed among studies and was closely related to different study areas and research objectives for example when studying ros induced flooding events large thresholds for rainfall and snow rainfall 10 mm d 1 falling on snowpack 10 mm snow water equivalent are used and snowmelt needs to be considered musselman et al 2018 we defined an ros day as a day with daily rainfall 1 mm falling on snow covered cells we used lower thresholds of rainfall and snow cover to identify ros days as we wanted to reveal the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of all possible ros events following the methods of previous studies lu et al 2021 ye et al 2008 2 7 analysis of spatiotemporal changes of ros we developed a ros identification program based on improved modis snow data and cmfd data to extract the spatial distribution of daily ros in china from 2001 to 2018 the changing trend of ros was analyzed using the mann kendall m k trend test hirsch and slack 1984 the theil sen slope sen and kumar 1968 which is often used to determine the slope of the trend line in hydrological time series mohsin and gough 2010 was applied to further quantify the rate of change of this trend as this method provides a more robust slope and reduces the effect of outliers or extreme values in the time series compared to the least squares method sen and kumar 1968 we also analyzed variations in snow cover days rain days and snowfall rainfall ratio to understand the changes in ros days finally we used correlation analysis to explore the response of ros to temperature rise and the relation of ros with aoi naoi and oni we obtained aoi naoi and oni from the united states climate prediction center website https climatedataguide ucar edu aoi and oni use the average value from december to may each year and naoi is an annual value 3 results 3 1 spatial distribution of ros in china 3 1 1 spatial distribution of yearly average annual ros days the spatial distribution of annual average annual ros days in china from 2001 to 2018 fig 4 a suggested that ros in china mostly occurred in four regions northern xinjiang qinghai tibet plateau northeast china and east china therefore this study focused on the changes in ros levels in these four regions in general since the relatively stable long term snow cover in china s three major snow covered regions northern xinjiang qinghai tibet plateau and northeast china provides more opportunities for the occurrence of ros events ros days were more frequent in northern xinjiang 6 1 days year qinghai tibet plateau 2 8 days year and northeast china 3 5 days year than in east china 1 1 days year alpine areas are prone to ros days owing to sufficient rain and snow conditions fig 4 ros days in northern xinjiang mostly occurred in the altay mountains and tianshan mountains at the same time there are also more ros days in the ili river valley and northern tacheng those in northeast china mostly occurred in the daxing an mountains xiaoxing an mountains and changbai mountains there are also more ros days in the northern part of the northeast plain ros days in qinghai tibet plateau mostly occurred in the qilian mountains and high mountains of southeastern tibet the overall number of ros days in east china was relatively small mainly in shandong henan and anhui the spatial pattern of the average annual ros rainfall sum of annual ros rainfall in china is similar to the number of ros days fig 4b generally areas with more ros days experienced more ros rainfall in particular the altai mountains tianshan mountains and ili river valley in northern xinjiang western hengduan mountains of the qinghai tibet plateau the east of northeast china 3 1 2 spatial distribution of monthly ros days the average monthly ros days in china from 2001 to 2018 fig 5 suggest that ros events in china mainly occurred from november to june from july to october with only a few ros events occurring in the high mountains of southeastern tibet which are not shown from the perspective of china as a whole the variation in monthly ros starts in november peaks in march and subsides in june however the monthly ros in sub regions of china showed different patterns figs 5 and 6 in northern xinjiang there were few rain days in november fig 5 and only a few ros days occurred in the lower altitude area fig 6 from december to february the increase in the number of rain days and snow days led to an increase in ros days in areas below 1500 m figs 6 and 7 ros was mainly active in junggar basin and yili valley ros days in the lower altitude area 1500 m reached the most during this period december to february fig 7 from march to may the continuous reduction of snow days resulted in a significant decrease in ros days in the lower altitude area 1500 m fig 6 there is almost no ros in the jungar basin and the ili river valley in april fig 5 during this period march to may due to the continuous increase of rain days fig 7 ros days increased substantially in higher altitude area 1500 m and were significantly more active than in lower altitude 1500 m figs 6 and 7b mainly in the tianshan mountains and altai mountains in june the number of snow days in higher altitude area 1500 m also decreased fig 7b resulting in fewer ros days in this area fig 6 in tibetan plateau ros is mainly distributed in southeastern tibet a few ros was detected in november and december on the southwest of the hengduan mountains fig 5 ros days began to appear in large numbers on the southwest of the hengduan mountains in january and showed a monotonically increasing trend from january to april fig 7b with a fan shaped expansion from the south edge to the north in space fig 5 the number of ros days in each altitude area increased with the month and the distribution of ros tended to high altitude area fig 6 during this period january to april snow days on the qinghai tibet plateau were relatively stable fig 7b and the dominant factor for this monotonically increasing ros trend was the rapid increase in the number of rain days fig 7a simultaneously increased rain days on the qilian mountains and the southern slope of the west himalayas led to an increase in the number of ros days in march and april the increase in the number of ros days switched to a decreasing trend in may from may to june rain days continued to increase fig 7a but snow days decreased fig 7b ros mainly occurred at higher altitude area 4000 m fig 6 and the reduction in snow days was responsible for the reduction in ros days in northeast china in december the number of snow days increased significantly the number of rain days increased slightly fig 7b and ros days began to appear in the eastern part of the northeast plain from december to march rain days increased monotonically and the region had consistently high snow cover fig 7 consequently the number of ros days showed a monotonous upward trend from december to march and spatially expanded to the daxing an mountains xiaoxing an mountains and changbai mountains figs 5 and 6 from april to may ros is mainly distributed in the daxing an mountains the number of rain days increased fig 7a but the number of snow days decreased significantly figs 5 and 7b during this period the number of ros days exhibited a monotonically decreasing trend therefore the rapid melting of snow caused the rapid reduction in ros days in east china ros mainly occurred from november to february although there was a large coverage area fig 5 the number of ros days was low figs 6 and 7 the seasonal variation of snow days dominates the seasonal variation of ros days in this area fig 7b this can be explained by the area always having a high number of rain days fig 7a but having a short snow cover period about 1 3 days fig 7b which greatly reduces the possibility of the coexistence of rainfall and snow cover 3 2 changes in ros days in china fig 8 shows the variation of ros days in china from 2001 to 2018 on the whole the variation of ros days has great spatial heterogeneity especially in mountainous areas different altitude areas may show the opposite trend such as the altay mountains the ili river valley the greater khingan mountains and the hengduan mountains have observed a significant decrease in ros an increasing trend of ros was observed in tianshan mountains changbai mountains and qilian mountains specifically in northern xinjiang 0 3000 m altitude 0 16 days year 3000 4500 m altitude 0 15 days year 4500 5500 m altitude 0 34 days year in qinghai tibet plateau 0 4000 m altitude 0 21 days year 4000 5500 m altitude 0 06 days year 5500 6000 m altitude 0 07 days year in northeast china 0 500 m altitude 0 07 days year 500 2000 m altitude 0 12 days year 2000 2500 m altitude 0 25 days year in east china 0 3000 m altitude 0 1 days year fig 9 shows the changes of rain days snow days and snowfall rainfall ratio in china from 2001 to 2008 fig 10 shows the changes of ros days rain days snow days and snowfall rainfall ratio in different altitudes the causes of ros changes can be analyzed by comparing the changes of these elements in northern xinjiang ros showed an increasing trend in low altitude areas 500 m mainly in junggar basin which was due to the increase of rain days and snow days in the 500 3000 m altitude area ros showed a decreasing trend among them 500 1500 m altitude areas such as the ili river valley and the middle and low mountains of the altai mountains the decrease in ros is due to the combined reduction of rain days and snow days in the 1500 3000 m elevation area such as the altai mountains and the middle mountains of the tianshan mountains it is mainly due to the decrease of rain days the snow days in this elevation range are increasing at the altitude of 3000 4000 m especially in the middle of the eastern tianshan mountains ros showed an increasing trend and the snowfall rainfall ratio showed a significant decreasing trend while the rain days were increasing therefore we speculate that the conversion of more snowfall to rainfall and the increase of snow cover days increase ros in the 4000 5500 m altitude area ros showed a decreasing trend and the snowfall rainfall ratio was significantly increased 5000 5500 m altitude area also found a greatly increase in the snow rain ratio but did not pass the 95 confidence level at the same time the significant decrease of rain days and the significant increase of snow days so we infer that the decrease of ros is due to more rainfall conversion to snowfall in the qinghai tibet plateau ros changes with altitude are more regular than those in northern xinjiang ros decreased at lower elevations 4000 m especially in the hengduan mountains mainly due to the decrease in rain days and snow days ros showed an increasing trend at higher altitudes 4000 5500 m mainly in the north of the hengduan mountains and the qilian mountains however we found a decrease in snow days a significant increase in the snowfall rainfall ratio and a further increase in rain days so we believe that more snowfall conversion to rainfall increases ros at very high altitudes 5500 6000 m reduced snow days and more rain being converted to snowfall reduce ros in the northeast at low elevations 500 m mainly at the junction of the northeast plain and the changbai mountains ros showed an increasing trend which can be explained by an increase in rain days and snow days a decrease in ros was observed in the middle elevations 500 1500 m mainly in the daxing an mountains and xiaoxing an mountains due to a decrease in snow days at high altitudes 2000 m mainly in the changbai mountains a decreasing trend in ros was found attributed to an increase in the number of snow days rain days also increased but did not pass the 95 confidence level in addition we found that all altitudes in northeast china showed a trend of slight rainfall conversion to snowfall in east china ros decreases at all altitudes 0 300 m although there is a tendency to shift from snowfall to rainfall at altitudes below 2500 m however the snow days in all altitude areas are decreasing which further reduces the already short period of snow cover resulting in a decrease in ros 4 discussion 4 1 relationship between ros and temperature rise fig 11 shows the correlation between ros days and annual average temperature in china from 2001 to 2018 fig 12 shows the correlation between ros days and annual average temperature at different altitudes in the subregion from 2001 to 2018 overall we found that ros days were negatively correlated with annual average temperature at lower altitudes and positively correlated with annual average at higher altitudes especially in northern xinjiang and qinghai tibet plateau previous studies gao et al 2021 you et al 2020 have found that over the past decade high asia has experienced significant warming especially in the past two decades the higher the altitude the faster the warming rate in the southeast of qinghai tibet plateau li et al 2020 and the annual average snowfall rainfall ratio has shown a significant downward trend hou et al 2022 these trends are obvious in different seasons and altitudes but most obvious in warm seasons and higher altitudes dong and ming 2022 in our study we also found a decreasing trend in the snowfall rainfall ratio in high asian mountains fig 10 in addition we also found some interesting phenomena although the snowfall rainfall ratio in the high altitude of the tianshan mountains is decreasing fig 10 the snow cover time is increasing tao et al also found that the snowfall and snow accumulation in the high altitude of the tianshan mountains are increasing li et al 2022b yang et al 2022 some studies suggest that this may because the total precipitation is increasing dong and ming 2022 combined with our analysis in section 3 2 we believe that in the context of climate warming ros in high altitude areas will increase this is due to the increase in temperature at high altitudes will lead to more snowfall into rainfall increasing the emergence of ros this ros increase mechanism is widely present in the tianshan mountains in northern xinjiang at an altitude of 3000 m to 4000 m and the eastern tibetan plateau at an altitude of 4000 m to 5500 m on the other hand climate warming will lead to a decrease in ros at lower altitudes which can be mainly explained by the fact that warming leads to less snow duration and reduces the occurrence of ros which is mainly reflected in the northeast and north china the reduction of ros in the lower elevations of northern xinjiang and the qinghai tibet plateau is more complicated because we observed a decrease in snow cover days and rain days so we believe that the reduction of ros is their combined effect however at the current stage we believe that the effect of decreasing rainfall days is still greater than the effect of decreasing snow cover days because there are still higher snow cover days in the lower elevation areas of northern xinjiang and the qinghai tibet plateau fig 4 in the future if temperatures continue to warm less snow cover time may become the dominant factor there also have been interesting results regarding ros changes in regions outside china musselman et al 2018 found that in the future the sierra nevada headwaters of the colorado river and canadian rockies in north america ros became more frequent due to the persistence of seasonal snow cover and more snowfall turned to rain however at lower altitudes owing to reduced snow cover ros became less frequent especially in warmer regions such as the pacific ocean jeong and sushama 2018 found that ros generally increased in most of canada and northwestern united states from 1976 to 2005 under the projected future temperature increase scenario with an increase in rainfall frequency ros will accelerate snowmelt and future ros runoff will exceed rainfall volume especially in northeastern parts of north america l√≥pez moreno et al 2021 found that ros frequency may increase or decrease under a warmer climate depending on the changing balance between more frequent rain events caused by warmer more humid air and the shortening snow cover duration with climate warming these studies suggest that air temperature is the main driver of ros changes therefore in the context of temperature rise it is necessary to study ros events in order to better cope with the impact of climate change 4 2 relationship between ros and aoi naoi and oni thompason et al thompson and wallace 1998 wallace 2000 proposed that ao nao is the main mode affecting the winter climate variability in the northern hemisphere when ao is in a negative phase the pressure in the arctic is abnormally high and the pressure in the middle latitudes is abnormally low which makes cold air transport from higher latitudes to lower latitudes resulting in lower temperature in the middle latitudes the opposite is true when ao is in positive phase nao and ao have almost the same spatial structure over the north atlantic resulting in a high correlation between their time series nao is considered to be a form of ao wallace 2000 enso el ni√±o southern oscillation is an inverse pressure oscillation that occurs between the southeast pacific and the indian ocean and indonesia and its occurrence often causes global climate anomalies philander 1983 in this study we use aoi naoi and oni to reflect ao nao and enso respectively fig 13 shows the interannual variation of ros and aoi naoi oni we found that the change of ros has a significant negative correlation with aoi and naoi on the interannual scale but only in the northern and northeastern regions in previous studies many studies chen et al 2022 fang et al 2013 huang et al 2016 li and fang 2005 zhang et al 2015 have found that ao and nao have a significant impact on temperature precipitation and snow cover in northern china when ao and nao are high it will lead to high temperature and less snow cover in northern china when ao and nao are low it will lead to low temperature and more snow in northern china especially in winter in this study we found that ros was negatively correlated with aoi and naoi on the interannual scale in the northern and northeastern xinjiang we speculate that this is mainly due to the fact that low aoi and naoi will lead to low winter temperatures and deep snow cover increasing the melting period of snow and increasing the probability of ros occurrence especially in 2010 a significant negative correlation between ros and aoi and naoi in northern xinjiang fig 13 in the winter of 2010 there was the largest snowfall and serious snow disaster in northern xinjiang since the meteorological record li et al 2015 and the snow melting in the same year caused serious flood disaster chen et al 2021 zhou et al 2021a similarly ye et al 2008 found that naoi influenced ros and rainfall in the northern part of european russia pall et al 2018 found that ros events in winter and spring in norway were broadly related to naoi and more closely related to aoi therefore ao and nao may also be important reasons for the interannual changes of ros 4 3 limitations and further work the uncertainty of ros change in this study mainly comes from the uncertainty of climate data especially in the western part of china due to the complex terrain and the scarcity of meteorological observation stations especially the precipitation in the western mountainous areas has great spatial variability therefore the creation and verification of climate data in western china has been facing great challenges in addition the snow cover on the tibetan plateau changes rapidly and there is still a lot of uncertainty in the extraction of snow cover information during the snowmelt period by optical remote sensing which means that rainfall may not exist at the same time as snow cover in addition we must also recognize that the downscaling method and the judgment method of precipitation type also bring uncertainty which is also limited by the scarcity of measured data in addition in terms of changes in ros and its causes this paper is only a comparative analysis of china s four sub regions carried out a rough analysis of the overall general law in fact the changes of snow snow duration rainfall temperature and terrain lead to the changes of ros which may be different in different regions and different seasons therefore more detailed research on the changes of ros in small regions needs to be further studied for example the qinghai tibet plateau and the tianshan mountains constitute the largest glacierized regions outside the earth s polar regions the changes of ros events at the top of glaciers are worth exploring similarly this paper discusses the relationship between temperature change and ros and the possible changes of ros under the background of temperature rise however the effect of temperature rise and rainfall change on ros at different altitudes still needs further study and this study simply discussed the correlation between ros and the interannual variation of aoi naoi and oni but we did not draw a conclusion for the specific mechanism in fact the relationship between ros and aoi naoi and oni is very complex considering their relationship in seasonal changes and whether there is a lag in this relationship need further study exploring the relationship and influence mechanism between ros and ao nao and enso in china is also an important aspect to reveal the causes of ros changes in addition ros in the tibetan plateau is concentrated in spring and summer and the winter westerly index and summer monsoon index may also affect ros which is worthy of further study it is also worth noting that the impact of ros on regional water resources and the mechanism of its induced disasters especially the mechanism of ros induced flood disasters still need further study zhou et al 2021b 5 conclusions in this study we extracted the frequency and spatial distribution of ros in china from 2001 to 2018 based on improved modis snow data and cmfd data we compared and analyzed the spatial distribution and seasonal variation mechanism of ros days in different regions of china and discussed the changes and causes of ros days under the background of temperature rise and the relation of ros and aoi naoi and oni the main conclusions are as follows 1 ros days mainly appeared from november to june and were mainly distributed in the mountainous areas of northern xinjiang 6 1 days year and qinghai tibet plateau 2 8 days year northeast china 3 5 days year and east china 1 1 days year there were distinct seasonal variation patterns in ros days in different regions of china 2 ros days have shown a trend of increasing at higher latitudes in china especially in northern xinjiang and the qinghai tibet plateau ros days are increasing at 3000 4000 m altitudes 0 15 days year in the tianshan mountains and 4000 5500 altitudes 0 06 days year in the eastern tibetan mountains mainly explained by more snowfall converted to rainfall 3 ros days have shown a trend of decreasing at lower and extremely high latitudes and in china ros days are decreasing below 3000 m in northern xinjiang 0 16 days year and below 4000 m in the qinghai tibet plateau 0 21 days year which is explained by the decrease of snow days and rainfall days ros days are decreasing above 4500 m in northern xinjiang 0 34 days year and above 5500 m in the qinghai tibet plateau 0 07 days year which is explained by the decrease rain days the ros days along the greater khingan mountains in northeast china showed a decreasing trend 0 12 days year and all latitudes in east china shows a decreasing trend 0 1 days year explained by a decrease in snow cover time 4 in china ros days at low altitudes are negatively correlated with annual average temperature and positively at high altitudes this is because the warming reduces the duration of snow cover in the low altitude area and makes the precipitation in the higher altitude area change from snowfall to rainfall author contributions gang zhou conceptualization methodology validation visualization writing original draft

2309,rain on snow ros events can accelerate snow melting which in turn leads to disasters such as floods avalanches and landslides however little is known about the characteristics of and changes in ros events in china in this study the temporal and spatial variations of ros days in china from 2001 to 2018 were investigated using the improved moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer snow cover data and china meteorological forcing dataset the results suggested that ros days in china mainly occurred from november to june and were mainly distributed in northern xinjiang 6 1 days year qinghai tibet plateau 2 8 days year northeast china 3 5 days year and east china 1 1 days year ros days in each region have different seasonal distribution patterns in the past 18 years ros days have shown a trend of increasing at higher latitudes and decreasing at lower latitudes in china especially in northern xinjiang and the qinghai tibet plateau ros days are decreasing below 3000 m in northern xinjiang 0 16 days year and below 4000 m in the qinghai tibet plateau 0 21 days year which is explained by the decrease of snow days and rain days ros days are increasing at 3000 4000 m altitudes 0 15 days year in the tianshan mountains and 4000 5500 m altitudes 0 06 days year in the eastern tibetan mountains mainly explained by more snowfall converted to rainfall the ros days along the greater khingan mountains in northeast china showed a decreasing trend 0 12 days year and along the changbai mountains showed an increasing trend 0 07 days year the variation of snow cover days is the dominant factor east china as a whole shows a decreasing trend 0 1 days year explained by a decrease in snow cover time in china ros days at low altitudes are negatively correlated with annual average temperature and positively at high altitudes the changes of ros were also correlated with arctic oscillation and north atlantic oscillation this study reveals the response of ros to climate change in china and provides an important reference for coping with the related disasters and changes caused by ros events keywords rain on snow events change pattern rainfall snow snowfall rainfall ratio china data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction rainfall during the snow cover period is known as a rain on snow ros event ohba and kawase 2020 ros events are more complex hydrological phenomena than extreme rainfall events huang et al 2021 and can have extreme effects such as accelerating melting of snow eiriksson et al 2013 singh et al 1997 which in turn can lead to disasters such as floods avalanches and landslides harr 1981 marks et al 2015 stimberis and rubin 2011 for example in february 2017 the oroville dam in california collapsed due to extreme ros events resulting in the evacuation of approximately 190 000 people vahedifard et al 2017 in the long run the heat released by rainfall will accelerate the warming of snow cover making it more susceptible to later rainfall rennert et al 2009 then the accumulated rainfall and snowmelt water on the soil surface will release heat to accelerate permafrost thawing rennert et al 2009 which in turn can accelerate the release of soil carbon into the atmosphere in the form of dissolved organic matter or gas hobbie et al 2000 in addition surface ice formed by rain hinders the growth of vegetation and foraging of ungulates berger et al 2018 putkonen and roe 2003 therefore it is critical to study the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of ros and evaluate the response process of ros events under climate change for snowmelt disasters and ecological processes because ros events mainly occur in high altitude mountainous areas with complex terrain and few monitoring sites it is difficult to capture the exact process of ros events therefore at present most studies on the temporal and spatial changes in ros events use the number of ros days generally defined as rainfall and snow cover in a single day exceeding a certain threshold e g rainfall snow cover snow depth and snow water equivalent swe pall et al 2018 other studies use the phase changes of the snow surface detected by microwave remote sensing data to establish indicators such as snow surface humidity and thresholds dolant et al 2016 langlois et al 2017 pan et al 2018 these thresholds are often related to the characteristics of the study area and the purpose of the study the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics of ros days and their changes in response to climate warming have been investigated using observational data lu et al 2021 mccabe et al 2007 mor√°n tejeda et al 2017 pradhanang et al 2013 ye et al 2008 reanalysis data bieniek et al 2018 jeong and sushama 2018 and model simulation l√≥pez moreno et al 2021 musselman et al 2018 ohba and kawase 2020 pall et al 2018 mccabe et al 2007 revealed the spatial pattern and seasonal characteristics of ros days in the western united states using meteorological station data which suggested that the trends in ros event frequency are generally positive for high altitude sites and negative for low altitude sites further increasing temperature appears to be a contributing factor to this trend musselman et al 2018 used the weather research and forecasting wrf model and a land surface model to simulate future changes in ros days in western north america and found that ros events became less frequent at lower altitudes due to reduced snow cover under warmer climate conditions in contrast ros events became more frequent at higher altitudes due to the shift from snow to rain in regions of persistent seasonal snow cover using data from meteorological stations ye et al 2008 found that in europe and russia ros mostly occurred in winter and the number of ros days increased mainly due to increases in the number of rainfall days while air temperature is the main cause of these changes the north atlantic oscillation has some influence on ros and rainfall in northern europe and northern russia pall et al 2018 simulated the temporal and spatial characteristics of ros days in norway using a hydrological model and suggested that winter spring ros events broadly correlate with the north atlantic oscillation while the scandinavia pattern more strongly correlates with the arctic oscillation using remote sensing information from the advanced microwave scanning radiometer sensors amsr e pan et al 2018 found that the frequency and extent of wet snow and ros events increased at high latitudes with increasing temperature especially in southwestern and inland alaska using regional model simulations ohba et al 2020 suggested that ros events in the mountains of hokuriku japan will increase in the future these studies suggested that ros exhibits strong regional patterns with varying driving forces indicating that in depth research on ros changes and their effects in different regions is needed cold regions account for 43 5 of the land area of china chen et al 2006 and rain snow mixed floods have increased in frequency in recent years chen et al 2021 however the spatial distribution frequency and variation of ros in china have rarely been reported accessible in situ observation sites for analyzing ros changes in high altitude mountainous areas are limited and thus some local changes may be missed using this method melgar and meza 2020 however there are also large uncertainties in the extraction of ros events by monitoring the snow surface state by microwave remote sensing because the driving factor for the phase change of snow state is not limited to rainfall events and the spatial resolution of the snow depth obtained by microwave remote sensing is relatively coarse such as amsr e 0 25 which makes it difficult to reflect changes in snow cover with varying terrain wang et al 2016 the evolution of snow cover simulated by hydrological or land surface models is coarse and it is difficult to reflect the complex snow cover distribution with varying terrain guo et al 2021 toure et al 2018 indeed the spatial distribution and frequency of ros days simulated by different models in the same area are varied bieniek et al 2018 pan et al 2018 with the development of remote sensing technology satellite missions including the tropical rainfall measurement mission trmm and the global precipitation measurement gpm mission have acquired large scale and continuous precipitation data battaglia et al 2020 some reanalysis data such as era5 hersbach et al 2020 cfsr sorrel 2010 and cmip5 taylor et al 2011 are also produced and widely used at the same time data assimilation technology based on multi source data has also developed rapidly for example the china meteorological forcing dataset he et al 2020 was made through fusion of remote sensing products reanalysis datasets and in situ station data these multi source fusion data provides a strong support for us to better understand the temperature and precipitation patterns in data scarce areas in snow information acquisition remote sensing research for snow information extraction snow mapping snow depth calculation snow water equivalent estimation and other snow parameter inversions has developed rapidly and a large number of remote sensing snow products have been produced and verified wang et al 2016 therefore we combined improved moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis snow cover and china meteorological forcing dataset cmfd to extract ros days in china we investigated the spatial distribution of ros at different altitude intervals on a 500 m grid and the change patterns and mechanisms of ros the remainder of the paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the data and methods section 3 discusses the distribution and change patterns of ros events in china and section 4 discusses the relationship between ros and temperature rise arctic oscillation index aoi north atlantic oscillation index naoi and oceanic ni√±o index oni as well as limitations and future work 2 data and methods 2 1 study area the study area of this study is mainland china fig 1 china is located in the west coast of the pacific ocean eastern eurasia climate is complex and diverse china s terrain is high in the west and low in the east roughly stepped distribution the terrain of high in the west and low in the east is conducive to the warm and humid airflow of the pacific ocean penetrating into the inland area the cold air in the north can drive southward for a long time which makes it easy to form abundant precipitation in the southeast the northwest region is deep inland far from the sea and is more affected by the terrain the precipitation generally decreases from southeast to northwest china s total snow cover area is as high as 9 million square kilometers and the stable season snow cover area reaches 4 2 million square kilometers li and mi 1983 the main areas are the qinghai tibet plateau northeast china northern and western xinjiang northern and eastern inner mongolia 2 2 modis daily cloudless snow cover dataset the recent modis daily cloudless snow cover dataset gao et al 2019 is based on the modis reflectance product mod myd09ga and developed a multi index combined snow cover discrimination algorithm under different land cover types simultaneously the hidden markov algorithm and multi source data fusion method were used to realize the complete cloud free acquisition of the product the validation against 362 china meteorological administration cma stations shows that during snow seasons the overall accuracy oa values of the datasets are larger than 93 the omission error oe values are constrained within 9 the commission error ce values are constrained within 10 bias values of 1 02 demonstrate on a whole that there is no significant overestimation nor a significant underestimation hao et al 2022 based on the same ground reference data the new product accuracies are obviously higher than standard modis snow products therefore this dataset has virtually provided more reliable snow knowledge over china thereby using this dataset instead of the initial modis snow cover product can improve the accuracy of ros identification more information about this dataset can be found in hao et al 2022 data were obtained from the national glacier and permafrost science data center https sdb casnw net portal 2 3 the china meteorological forcing dataset the cmfd he et al 2020 is the first high spatial temporal resolution gridded near surface meteorological dataset developed specifically for studying land surface processes in china the dataset was created through the fusion of remote sensing products reanalysis datasets and in situ observation data it includes data from january 1979 and is ongoing currently up to december 2018 with a temporal resolution of three hours and a spatial resolution of 0 1 data on seven near surface meteorological elements are provided in the cmfd including 2 meter air temperature surface pressure specific humidity 10 meter wind speed downward shortwave radiation downward longwave radiation and precipitation rate validations against observations measured at independent stations show that the cmfd is of superior quality than the global land data assimilation system gldas because a larger number of stations are used to generate the cmfd than are used in the gldas owing to its continuous temporal coverage and consistent quality the cmfd is one of the most widely used climate datasets in china he et al 2020 has many studies du et al 2022 he et al 2021 li et al 2022a yan et al 2021 yang et al 2021 zhang et al 2022 evaluated the accuracy of the cmfd and other products and found that the data provided by the cmfd have higher accuracy than those from other products in china this study mainly uses three elements of daily precipitation daily temperature and daily specific humidity in the cmfd from 2001 to 2018 daily precipitation is used to extract rain days daily temperature and daily specific humidity are used to calculate the type of precipitation 2 4 downscaling of cmfd in this study the spatial resolution of precipitation air temperature and specific humidity data was 10 km while that of snow cover data was 500 m however ros is determined by precipitation temperature and snow cover and its changes are strongly correlated with topographic in order to analyze the variation of ros with terrain the daily precipitation daily temperature and daily specific humidity data of cmfd were downscaled to 500 m by terrain correction however the gradient varies in different regions and seasons therefore we define the gradient considering the spatiotemporal variation for air temperature firstly the monthly average temperature is calculated by cmfd temperature data from 2001 to 2018 secondly a sliding window of 5x5 size is defined and the gradient of the target grid is calculated from the temperature and elevation data of the nearest 21 cells in order to ensure the consistency of the data the 0 1 resolution dem provided by cmfd is used to obtain elevation for each cell the monthly gradient is calculated in the same way which means that each cell of 0 1 has its own gradient and changes with the month fig 2 a shows the gradient of march temperature in china calculated by sliding window finally we use a 500 m dem resampled by 30 m aster gdem v2 data tachikawa et al 2011 to obtain a 500 m temperature by gradient correction fig 3 shows the cmfd daily temperature a and downscaled cmfd daily temperature b in the east tianshan area on january 1 2001 for precipitation we use the same way as the temperature to get the monthly precipitaion gradient fig 2b shows the gradient of may precipitation in china calculated by sliding window however for precipitation data it is necessary to correct the outliers caused by downscaling e g rainfall 0 or extremely heavy rainfall therefore the correction of rainfall defines a relatively conservative interval for daily precipitation we define a 3 3 sliding window to find the maximum and minimum precipitation from the nine nearest grids of the target grid which is the range that the target grid can be corrected this can avoid the abnormal value of precipitation during downscaling and ensure the continuity of rainfall with terrain changes in space fig 3 shows the cmfd daily precipitation c and downscaled cmfd daily precipitation d in east tianshan on may 19 2001 for specific humidity we downscale it in the same way as the temperature similarly using terrain correction for specific humidity also results in outliers however because we use relative humidity when judging the type of precipitation we need to convert specific humidity to relative humidity and the range of relative humidity is 0 to 1 we assign the value less than 0 to 0 and the value greater than 1 to 1 through this correction a reasonable relative humidity is obtained and the outliers caused by specific humidity in downscaling are corrected 2 5 identification of precipitation types the difficulty in extracting ros days lies in distinguishing the types of precipitation which largely affects the accuracy of temporal and spatial changes in ros this is because many precipitation datasets cannot identify precipitation type in most field or small watershed studies rain and snow are often separated using the temperature threshold which varies according to the study area most hydrological models such as swat soil and water assessment tool vic variable infiltration capacity model also use this strategy however many studies ding et al 2014 jennings et al 2018 sun et al 2022 ye et al 2013 have shown that the method of precipitation type division combined with relative humidity is superior to the strategy of only considering temperature ding et al 2014 developed a new scheme to distinguish precipitation types based on more than 400 000 precipitation type samples collected from different climatic conditions and altitudes in china this method can calculate the corresponding precipitation type by inputting wet bulb temperature relative humidity and elevation studies ding et al 2014 sun et al 2022 have shown that the ding method shows high accuracy in distinguishing precipitation types in china therefore in this study we used the ding method to determine the type of precipitation two threshold temperatures tmin and tmax were defined in this method so that the precipitation type is determined by the following factors type snow t w t m i n s l e e t t m i n t w t m a x r a i n t w t m a x tw is the daily wet bulb temperature and tmin and tmax are two threshold temperatures that depend on relative humidity and elevation the calculation of tw tmin and tmax can be found in ding et al 2014 2 6 definition of ros day in previous studies bieniek et al 2018 jeong and sushama 2018 lu et al 2021 mccabe et al 2007 musselman et al 2018 ohba and kawase 2020 pall et al 2018 pradhanang et al 2013 ye et al 2008 ros days were usually defined as a day with both snow cover and rainfall however the thresholds of snow cover and rainfall differed among studies and was closely related to different study areas and research objectives for example when studying ros induced flooding events large thresholds for rainfall and snow rainfall 10 mm d 1 falling on snowpack 10 mm snow water equivalent are used and snowmelt needs to be considered musselman et al 2018 we defined an ros day as a day with daily rainfall 1 mm falling on snow covered cells we used lower thresholds of rainfall and snow cover to identify ros days as we wanted to reveal the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of all possible ros events following the methods of previous studies lu et al 2021 ye et al 2008 2 7 analysis of spatiotemporal changes of ros we developed a ros identification program based on improved modis snow data and cmfd data to extract the spatial distribution of daily ros in china from 2001 to 2018 the changing trend of ros was analyzed using the mann kendall m k trend test hirsch and slack 1984 the theil sen slope sen and kumar 1968 which is often used to determine the slope of the trend line in hydrological time series mohsin and gough 2010 was applied to further quantify the rate of change of this trend as this method provides a more robust slope and reduces the effect of outliers or extreme values in the time series compared to the least squares method sen and kumar 1968 we also analyzed variations in snow cover days rain days and snowfall rainfall ratio to understand the changes in ros days finally we used correlation analysis to explore the response of ros to temperature rise and the relation of ros with aoi naoi and oni we obtained aoi naoi and oni from the united states climate prediction center website https climatedataguide ucar edu aoi and oni use the average value from december to may each year and naoi is an annual value 3 results 3 1 spatial distribution of ros in china 3 1 1 spatial distribution of yearly average annual ros days the spatial distribution of annual average annual ros days in china from 2001 to 2018 fig 4 a suggested that ros in china mostly occurred in four regions northern xinjiang qinghai tibet plateau northeast china and east china therefore this study focused on the changes in ros levels in these four regions in general since the relatively stable long term snow cover in china s three major snow covered regions northern xinjiang qinghai tibet plateau and northeast china provides more opportunities for the occurrence of ros events ros days were more frequent in northern xinjiang 6 1 days year qinghai tibet plateau 2 8 days year and northeast china 3 5 days year than in east china 1 1 days year alpine areas are prone to ros days owing to sufficient rain and snow conditions fig 4 ros days in northern xinjiang mostly occurred in the altay mountains and tianshan mountains at the same time there are also more ros days in the ili river valley and northern tacheng those in northeast china mostly occurred in the daxing an mountains xiaoxing an mountains and changbai mountains there are also more ros days in the northern part of the northeast plain ros days in qinghai tibet plateau mostly occurred in the qilian mountains and high mountains of southeastern tibet the overall number of ros days in east china was relatively small mainly in shandong henan and anhui the spatial pattern of the average annual ros rainfall sum of annual ros rainfall in china is similar to the number of ros days fig 4b generally areas with more ros days experienced more ros rainfall in particular the altai mountains tianshan mountains and ili river valley in northern xinjiang western hengduan mountains of the qinghai tibet plateau the east of northeast china 3 1 2 spatial distribution of monthly ros days the average monthly ros days in china from 2001 to 2018 fig 5 suggest that ros events in china mainly occurred from november to june from july to october with only a few ros events occurring in the high mountains of southeastern tibet which are not shown from the perspective of china as a whole the variation in monthly ros starts in november peaks in march and subsides in june however the monthly ros in sub regions of china showed different patterns figs 5 and 6 in northern xinjiang there were few rain days in november fig 5 and only a few ros days occurred in the lower altitude area fig 6 from december to february the increase in the number of rain days and snow days led to an increase in ros days in areas below 1500 m figs 6 and 7 ros was mainly active in junggar basin and yili valley ros days in the lower altitude area 1500 m reached the most during this period december to february fig 7 from march to may the continuous reduction of snow days resulted in a significant decrease in ros days in the lower altitude area 1500 m fig 6 there is almost no ros in the jungar basin and the ili river valley in april fig 5 during this period march to may due to the continuous increase of rain days fig 7 ros days increased substantially in higher altitude area 1500 m and were significantly more active than in lower altitude 1500 m figs 6 and 7b mainly in the tianshan mountains and altai mountains in june the number of snow days in higher altitude area 1500 m also decreased fig 7b resulting in fewer ros days in this area fig 6 in tibetan plateau ros is mainly distributed in southeastern tibet a few ros was detected in november and december on the southwest of the hengduan mountains fig 5 ros days began to appear in large numbers on the southwest of the hengduan mountains in january and showed a monotonically increasing trend from january to april fig 7b with a fan shaped expansion from the south edge to the north in space fig 5 the number of ros days in each altitude area increased with the month and the distribution of ros tended to high altitude area fig 6 during this period january to april snow days on the qinghai tibet plateau were relatively stable fig 7b and the dominant factor for this monotonically increasing ros trend was the rapid increase in the number of rain days fig 7a simultaneously increased rain days on the qilian mountains and the southern slope of the west himalayas led to an increase in the number of ros days in march and april the increase in the number of ros days switched to a decreasing trend in may from may to june rain days continued to increase fig 7a but snow days decreased fig 7b ros mainly occurred at higher altitude area 4000 m fig 6 and the reduction in snow days was responsible for the reduction in ros days in northeast china in december the number of snow days increased significantly the number of rain days increased slightly fig 7b and ros days began to appear in the eastern part of the northeast plain from december to march rain days increased monotonically and the region had consistently high snow cover fig 7 consequently the number of ros days showed a monotonous upward trend from december to march and spatially expanded to the daxing an mountains xiaoxing an mountains and changbai mountains figs 5 and 6 from april to may ros is mainly distributed in the daxing an mountains the number of rain days increased fig 7a but the number of snow days decreased significantly figs 5 and 7b during this period the number of ros days exhibited a monotonically decreasing trend therefore the rapid melting of snow caused the rapid reduction in ros days in east china ros mainly occurred from november to february although there was a large coverage area fig 5 the number of ros days was low figs 6 and 7 the seasonal variation of snow days dominates the seasonal variation of ros days in this area fig 7b this can be explained by the area always having a high number of rain days fig 7a but having a short snow cover period about 1 3 days fig 7b which greatly reduces the possibility of the coexistence of rainfall and snow cover 3 2 changes in ros days in china fig 8 shows the variation of ros days in china from 2001 to 2018 on the whole the variation of ros days has great spatial heterogeneity especially in mountainous areas different altitude areas may show the opposite trend such as the altay mountains the ili river valley the greater khingan mountains and the hengduan mountains have observed a significant decrease in ros an increasing trend of ros was observed in tianshan mountains changbai mountains and qilian mountains specifically in northern xinjiang 0 3000 m altitude 0 16 days year 3000 4500 m altitude 0 15 days year 4500 5500 m altitude 0 34 days year in qinghai tibet plateau 0 4000 m altitude 0 21 days year 4000 5500 m altitude 0 06 days year 5500 6000 m altitude 0 07 days year in northeast china 0 500 m altitude 0 07 days year 500 2000 m altitude 0 12 days year 2000 2500 m altitude 0 25 days year in east china 0 3000 m altitude 0 1 days year fig 9 shows the changes of rain days snow days and snowfall rainfall ratio in china from 2001 to 2008 fig 10 shows the changes of ros days rain days snow days and snowfall rainfall ratio in different altitudes the causes of ros changes can be analyzed by comparing the changes of these elements in northern xinjiang ros showed an increasing trend in low altitude areas 500 m mainly in junggar basin which was due to the increase of rain days and snow days in the 500 3000 m altitude area ros showed a decreasing trend among them 500 1500 m altitude areas such as the ili river valley and the middle and low mountains of the altai mountains the decrease in ros is due to the combined reduction of rain days and snow days in the 1500 3000 m elevation area such as the altai mountains and the middle mountains of the tianshan mountains it is mainly due to the decrease of rain days the snow days in this elevation range are increasing at the altitude of 3000 4000 m especially in the middle of the eastern tianshan mountains ros showed an increasing trend and the snowfall rainfall ratio showed a significant decreasing trend while the rain days were increasing therefore we speculate that the conversion of more snowfall to rainfall and the increase of snow cover days increase ros in the 4000 5500 m altitude area ros showed a decreasing trend and the snowfall rainfall ratio was significantly increased 5000 5500 m altitude area also found a greatly increase in the snow rain ratio but did not pass the 95 confidence level at the same time the significant decrease of rain days and the significant increase of snow days so we infer that the decrease of ros is due to more rainfall conversion to snowfall in the qinghai tibet plateau ros changes with altitude are more regular than those in northern xinjiang ros decreased at lower elevations 4000 m especially in the hengduan mountains mainly due to the decrease in rain days and snow days ros showed an increasing trend at higher altitudes 4000 5500 m mainly in the north of the hengduan mountains and the qilian mountains however we found a decrease in snow days a significant increase in the snowfall rainfall ratio and a further increase in rain days so we believe that more snowfall conversion to rainfall increases ros at very high altitudes 5500 6000 m reduced snow days and more rain being converted to snowfall reduce ros in the northeast at low elevations 500 m mainly at the junction of the northeast plain and the changbai mountains ros showed an increasing trend which can be explained by an increase in rain days and snow days a decrease in ros was observed in the middle elevations 500 1500 m mainly in the daxing an mountains and xiaoxing an mountains due to a decrease in snow days at high altitudes 2000 m mainly in the changbai mountains a decreasing trend in ros was found attributed to an increase in the number of snow days rain days also increased but did not pass the 95 confidence level in addition we found that all altitudes in northeast china showed a trend of slight rainfall conversion to snowfall in east china ros decreases at all altitudes 0 300 m although there is a tendency to shift from snowfall to rainfall at altitudes below 2500 m however the snow days in all altitude areas are decreasing which further reduces the already short period of snow cover resulting in a decrease in ros 4 discussion 4 1 relationship between ros and temperature rise fig 11 shows the correlation between ros days and annual average temperature in china from 2001 to 2018 fig 12 shows the correlation between ros days and annual average temperature at different altitudes in the subregion from 2001 to 2018 overall we found that ros days were negatively correlated with annual average temperature at lower altitudes and positively correlated with annual average at higher altitudes especially in northern xinjiang and qinghai tibet plateau previous studies gao et al 2021 you et al 2020 have found that over the past decade high asia has experienced significant warming especially in the past two decades the higher the altitude the faster the warming rate in the southeast of qinghai tibet plateau li et al 2020 and the annual average snowfall rainfall ratio has shown a significant downward trend hou et al 2022 these trends are obvious in different seasons and altitudes but most obvious in warm seasons and higher altitudes dong and ming 2022 in our study we also found a decreasing trend in the snowfall rainfall ratio in high asian mountains fig 10 in addition we also found some interesting phenomena although the snowfall rainfall ratio in the high altitude of the tianshan mountains is decreasing fig 10 the snow cover time is increasing tao et al also found that the snowfall and snow accumulation in the high altitude of the tianshan mountains are increasing li et al 2022b yang et al 2022 some studies suggest that this may because the total precipitation is increasing dong and ming 2022 combined with our analysis in section 3 2 we believe that in the context of climate warming ros in high altitude areas will increase this is due to the increase in temperature at high altitudes will lead to more snowfall into rainfall increasing the emergence of ros this ros increase mechanism is widely present in the tianshan mountains in northern xinjiang at an altitude of 3000 m to 4000 m and the eastern tibetan plateau at an altitude of 4000 m to 5500 m on the other hand climate warming will lead to a decrease in ros at lower altitudes which can be mainly explained by the fact that warming leads to less snow duration and reduces the occurrence of ros which is mainly reflected in the northeast and north china the reduction of ros in the lower elevations of northern xinjiang and the qinghai tibet plateau is more complicated because we observed a decrease in snow cover days and rain days so we believe that the reduction of ros is their combined effect however at the current stage we believe that the effect of decreasing rainfall days is still greater than the effect of decreasing snow cover days because there are still higher snow cover days in the lower elevation areas of northern xinjiang and the qinghai tibet plateau fig 4 in the future if temperatures continue to warm less snow cover time may become the dominant factor there also have been interesting results regarding ros changes in regions outside china musselman et al 2018 found that in the future the sierra nevada headwaters of the colorado river and canadian rockies in north america ros became more frequent due to the persistence of seasonal snow cover and more snowfall turned to rain however at lower altitudes owing to reduced snow cover ros became less frequent especially in warmer regions such as the pacific ocean jeong and sushama 2018 found that ros generally increased in most of canada and northwestern united states from 1976 to 2005 under the projected future temperature increase scenario with an increase in rainfall frequency ros will accelerate snowmelt and future ros runoff will exceed rainfall volume especially in northeastern parts of north america l√≥pez moreno et al 2021 found that ros frequency may increase or decrease under a warmer climate depending on the changing balance between more frequent rain events caused by warmer more humid air and the shortening snow cover duration with climate warming these studies suggest that air temperature is the main driver of ros changes therefore in the context of temperature rise it is necessary to study ros events in order to better cope with the impact of climate change 4 2 relationship between ros and aoi naoi and oni thompason et al thompson and wallace 1998 wallace 2000 proposed that ao nao is the main mode affecting the winter climate variability in the northern hemisphere when ao is in a negative phase the pressure in the arctic is abnormally high and the pressure in the middle latitudes is abnormally low which makes cold air transport from higher latitudes to lower latitudes resulting in lower temperature in the middle latitudes the opposite is true when ao is in positive phase nao and ao have almost the same spatial structure over the north atlantic resulting in a high correlation between their time series nao is considered to be a form of ao wallace 2000 enso el ni√±o southern oscillation is an inverse pressure oscillation that occurs between the southeast pacific and the indian ocean and indonesia and its occurrence often causes global climate anomalies philander 1983 in this study we use aoi naoi and oni to reflect ao nao and enso respectively fig 13 shows the interannual variation of ros and aoi naoi oni we found that the change of ros has a significant negative correlation with aoi and naoi on the interannual scale but only in the northern and northeastern regions in previous studies many studies chen et al 2022 fang et al 2013 huang et al 2016 li and fang 2005 zhang et al 2015 have found that ao and nao have a significant impact on temperature precipitation and snow cover in northern china when ao and nao are high it will lead to high temperature and less snow cover in northern china when ao and nao are low it will lead to low temperature and more snow in northern china especially in winter in this study we found that ros was negatively correlated with aoi and naoi on the interannual scale in the northern and northeastern xinjiang we speculate that this is mainly due to the fact that low aoi and naoi will lead to low winter temperatures and deep snow cover increasing the melting period of snow and increasing the probability of ros occurrence especially in 2010 a significant negative correlation between ros and aoi and naoi in northern xinjiang fig 13 in the winter of 2010 there was the largest snowfall and serious snow disaster in northern xinjiang since the meteorological record li et al 2015 and the snow melting in the same year caused serious flood disaster chen et al 2021 zhou et al 2021a similarly ye et al 2008 found that naoi influenced ros and rainfall in the northern part of european russia pall et al 2018 found that ros events in winter and spring in norway were broadly related to naoi and more closely related to aoi therefore ao and nao may also be important reasons for the interannual changes of ros 4 3 limitations and further work the uncertainty of ros change in this study mainly comes from the uncertainty of climate data especially in the western part of china due to the complex terrain and the scarcity of meteorological observation stations especially the precipitation in the western mountainous areas has great spatial variability therefore the creation and verification of climate data in western china has been facing great challenges in addition the snow cover on the tibetan plateau changes rapidly and there is still a lot of uncertainty in the extraction of snow cover information during the snowmelt period by optical remote sensing which means that rainfall may not exist at the same time as snow cover in addition we must also recognize that the downscaling method and the judgment method of precipitation type also bring uncertainty which is also limited by the scarcity of measured data in addition in terms of changes in ros and its causes this paper is only a comparative analysis of china s four sub regions carried out a rough analysis of the overall general law in fact the changes of snow snow duration rainfall temperature and terrain lead to the changes of ros which may be different in different regions and different seasons therefore more detailed research on the changes of ros in small regions needs to be further studied for example the qinghai tibet plateau and the tianshan mountains constitute the largest glacierized regions outside the earth s polar regions the changes of ros events at the top of glaciers are worth exploring similarly this paper discusses the relationship between temperature change and ros and the possible changes of ros under the background of temperature rise however the effect of temperature rise and rainfall change on ros at different altitudes still needs further study and this study simply discussed the correlation between ros and the interannual variation of aoi naoi and oni but we did not draw a conclusion for the specific mechanism in fact the relationship between ros and aoi naoi and oni is very complex considering their relationship in seasonal changes and whether there is a lag in this relationship need further study exploring the relationship and influence mechanism between ros and ao nao and enso in china is also an important aspect to reveal the causes of ros changes in addition ros in the tibetan plateau is concentrated in spring and summer and the winter westerly index and summer monsoon index may also affect ros which is worthy of further study it is also worth noting that the impact of ros on regional water resources and the mechanism of its induced disasters especially the mechanism of ros induced flood disasters still need further study zhou et al 2021b 5 conclusions in this study we extracted the frequency and spatial distribution of ros in china from 2001 to 2018 based on improved modis snow data and cmfd data we compared and analyzed the spatial distribution and seasonal variation mechanism of ros days in different regions of china and discussed the changes and causes of ros days under the background of temperature rise and the relation of ros and aoi naoi and oni the main conclusions are as follows 1 ros days mainly appeared from november to june and were mainly distributed in the mountainous areas of northern xinjiang 6 1 days year and qinghai tibet plateau 2 8 days year northeast china 3 5 days year and east china 1 1 days year there were distinct seasonal variation patterns in ros days in different regions of china 2 ros days have shown a trend of increasing at higher latitudes in china especially in northern xinjiang and the qinghai tibet plateau ros days are increasing at 3000 4000 m altitudes 0 15 days year in the tianshan mountains and 4000 5500 altitudes 0 06 days year in the eastern tibetan mountains mainly explained by more snowfall converted to rainfall 3 ros days have shown a trend of decreasing at lower and extremely high latitudes and in china ros days are decreasing below 3000 m in northern xinjiang 0 16 days year and below 4000 m in the qinghai tibet plateau 0 21 days year which is explained by the decrease of snow days and rainfall days ros days are decreasing above 4500 m in northern xinjiang 0 34 days year and above 5500 m in the qinghai tibet plateau 0 07 days year which is explained by the decrease rain days the ros days along the greater khingan mountains in northeast china showed a decreasing trend 0 12 days year and all latitudes in east china shows a decreasing trend 0 1 days year explained by a decrease in snow cover time 4 in china ros days at low altitudes are negatively correlated with annual average temperature and positively at high altitudes this is because the warming reduces the duration of snow cover in the low altitude area and makes the precipitation in the higher altitude area change from snowfall to rainfall author contributions gang zhou conceptualization methodology validation visualization writing original draft
