2830,seepage in dispersive soils has contributed to inducing severe damage to hydraulic structures worldwide whereas its targeted quantitative and refined characterizations have long been overlooked this study jointly adopted the laboratory constant head seepage test and hydrus 1d simulation to explore the dynamic seepage behavior in compacted unsaturated salt affected dispersive soil columns lean clay with sand the impacts of two crucial factors including initial soil soluble salt content η 0 0 3 1 0 2 0 and dry density ρ d 1 44 1 53 1 62 g cm3 were considered the matric suction of each experimental case was measured to characterize initial unsaturation and the post seepage particle and pore distributions of a representative case were measured to clarify the seepage consequence furthermore the spatiotemporal evolutions of water soluble salt and hydraulic conductivity during seepage were captured laboratory results suggested that the advance of the wetting front conformed to a power function increasing η 0 and ρ d reduced and prolonged the total test duration by 19 2 38 2 and 4 4 38 6 respectively since dispersive soil features a water sensitive skeleton fine particles could be dragged downward by water flow thus simplifying the pore microstructure near the soil column top under such a low head of 2 cm here this finding implied that the threshold hydraulic gradient corresponding to the formation of internal erosion in dispersive soil can be quite low based on simulation results rapid salt accumulation formed where the wetting front arrived in contrast to the following slower leaching process higher η 0 contributed to stronger permeability the magnitude order of hydraulic conductivity ranged between 10 16 and 10 7 m s from initially unsaturated state to saturated state and that of saturated soil was mainly 10 8 m s reflecting the poor permeability of dispersive soil these novel findings are expected to deepen the soil water interaction understanding

dispersive soil as a worldwide distributed special soil has become a global concern in water conservancy construction over the last two decades its particularity lies in that while encountering water especially with low salinity the soil particles soon lose their most cohesion and then disintegrate into primary particles the clay particles suspended in water in form of colloid without coagulation resulting in a rapid breakdown of soil structure due to the loss in cementitious material bell and walker 2000 fan and kong 2013 quiñónez samaniego et al 2021 zorluer et al 2010 up to now most efforts with respect to dispersive soil were put into soil improvement by utilizing multifarious chemical or biological additives unfortunately although the dispersity is only shown when interacting with water the insight of its hydro physical properties has not made conspicuous progress dispersive soil mainly destroys the landscape or functional engineering structures in the manner of erosion fell et al 2003 garcía ruiz et al 1997 han et al 2022a masoodi et al 2019 premkumar et al 2016 rui et al 2019 wang and song 2022 and internal erosion failure is prone to be formed in dispersive soil subjected to seepage vakili et al 2020 the erosion consequences induced by seepage are easily identifiable but the seepage characteristics when water transports in soil pores remain qualitative and ambiguous hence it is necessary to conduct purposeful explorations regarding dispersive soil seepage in the aeration zone is one of the most frequently discussed natural hydrologic phenomena on the earth driven by gravity and soil suctions liquid water migrates in the pores and cracks of unsaturated soil and further affects soil properties via increasing saturation yoshimoto et al 2011 and dispersing transporting particles zuo et al 2020 plenty of soil failures are triggered by the seepage process such as erosion chu agor et al 2008 owoputi and stolte 2001 pipping richards and reddy 2012 shallow landslides kim et al 2018 dam deformation jiang et al 2020 li and ming 2004 etc especially when water content and matric suction suffer changes under rainfall situation park 2016 unraveling the seepage characteristics of water in unsaturated soil is the first step to scientifically deal with these disasters whose estimation plays a crucial role in executing unsaturated saturated mass transfer analyses sako and kitamura 2006 in view of the scarce research on the seepage of dispersive soil that of other soil types may well enlighten the current study for instance lin et al 2019 carried out a long term seepage test on loess and observed that the soluble salt migrated and redistributed with water and then leads to structural changes she et al 2019 confirmed that divalent cations in the upper part of expansive soil migrated downward with water flow under unidirectional seepage zeng et al 2020 noticed that when performing column test the seepage velocity close to the container wall was faster than that in the middle at a cross section qin et al 2022 proposed that the seepage process in loess under single point water supply could be divided into four stages including rapid stable slow and preferential infiltration periods in addition numerical simulation can help obtain some necessary parameters that are difficult to accurately capture via laboratory seepage tests such as the widely used hydrus 1d code for solving one dimensional infiltration problems amini et al 2020 ngo cong et al 2021 rahmati et al 2020 young et al 2002 thus the combined application of laboratory test and numerical simulation is believed to provide more convincing and detailed results which is worth trying to understand the to be revealed seepage process in dispersive soil dispersive soil usually contains certain amounts of soluble salt abbaslou et al 2016 compared to anions the cations influence soil properties more as the mainstream indexes used to evaluate dispersity are mainly derived from cations such as sar cross rengasamy and marchuk 2011 charge sparsity melo et al 2020 etc whose valence and quantity thins or thickens the diffuse double layer adhered on the surface of clay particles by alternating the electric potential therein the enrichment of sodium ion is one of the generally accepted essential reasons for soil dispersity gutiérrez et al 2003 marchuk and rengasamy 2011 vakili et al 2018b which has often been discussed in relevant studies since it relates to the erosion initiation and particle breakdown ramezanpour et al 2010 it can be rationally speculated that the redistribution of soluble salt caused by seepage will change the local dispersion potential of dispersive soil so as to change the location of hidden dangers and conversely the change in soil salinity might also impact the seepage field by transforming soil structure therefore it is necessary to consider the influence of soil salinity while studying the seepage characteristics of dispersive soil despite the hydraulic conductivity and its pore scale mechanism of unsaturated dispersive soil in a cold arid region were defined and elaborated han et al 2022b han et al 2020 in which the soil salinity was found crucial to govern the seepage speed this is not enough to describe the dynamic migrations of water and soluble salt since the migration of water and salt in soil is a very complex process zhang et al 2021b the law of how soluble salt migrates with water flow through dispersive soil deserves to investigate besides plus the effect caused by soil density which is a factor often considered in hydraulic constructions the seepage characteristics might be more interesting and complicated aiming at the existing research deficiencies in this study the dynamic seepage process and its consequence in dispersive soil with different initial soluble salt contents and dry densities were investigated by integrating laboratory constant head seepage tests and hydrus 1d numerical simulations two key scientific problems are expected to be unraveled via this work 1 experimental characterization of the seepage law in unsaturated dispersive soil and its refined descriptions based on water salt and permeability redistributions 2 variations in particle composition and microstructure of the water sensitive dispersive soil induced by the seepage process the findings to be obtained may advance a more in depth understanding of the soil water interaction characteristics of dispersive soil that was seldom focused on before 2 laboratory experiments 2 1 soil properties the particle size distribution of dispersive soil samples collected at 123 56 42 e 44 59 58 n in qian an ne china is shown in fig 1 the sand silt and clay particles accounted for 17 73 61 38 and 20 89 of the total respectively according to the conventional criterion that the uniformity coefficient cu d 60 d 10 5 and curvature coefficient cc d 30 2 d 10 d 60 1 3 refers to well graded soil the soil was poorly graded since its cu and cc were 15 07 and 0 64 respectively the particle density was 2 64 g cm3 the maximum dry density was 1 80 g cm3 the plastic and liquid limits were 18 2 and 33 3 respectively the soil was grouped as lean clay with sand as per the unified soil classification system astm 2017 by using 1 5 soil water extract the total soluble salt content was 0 169 na and hco3 were dominant cation and anion with contents of 19 12 and 17 40 mmol kg respectively the total dissolved salts tds k na ca2 mg2 was 4 44 meq l dispersity indexes including sodium adsorption ratio sar percentage sodium ps and cation exchange capacity were 7 2 86 1 and 11 10 cmolc kg respectively the ph was 8 83 the dispersity of this soil sample could be verified from three criteria 1 it was located in the dispersive zone on the tds ps chart sherard et al 1972 2 the sar was 2 4 times the threshold related to spontaneous dispersion of soil as suggested by rengasamy et al 1984 3 the ps exceeded 50 and then could be regarded as dispersive according to astm 2018 2 2 soil column preparation since the sampling site locates in a typical seasonally frozen semiarid salinized region zhang et al 2021a the fluctuating soil salinity is a non ignorable factor when discussing the permeability of dispersive soil han et al 2020 in addition not only for the hydraulic construction needs regional freeze thaw cycling also affects the soil permeability through changing its density based on these practical considerations soluble salt content η 0 mass ratio and dry density ρ d were chosen as variables in this study referring to the experience of pre experiments the initial mass water content ω 0 was set as 11 to concurrently ensure that 1 the soil was in an unsaturated state 2 effective cementation could be formed between soil particles and 3 the wetting front was easy to observe the experimental scheme including all nine cases is listed in table 1 soil samples were successively air dried crushed pulverized sieved 2 mm and evenly mixed such a series of treatments was to avoid the formation of local abnormal soil structure after compaction which might severely influence the trajectory of pore water flow based on the dominant composition of ions analytical pure sodium bicarbonate powder was added to achieve the required η 0 considering the clayey soil is sensitive to the amount of salt ions the dosage accuracy of sodium bicarbonate powder was 0 0001 g distilled water in calculated dosage was used to cement the evenly blended dry soil salt mixtures with the aid of a sprayer to obtain a uniform distribution of salt and water the humidified mixtures were then sealed and cured in a 20 incubator for 24 h column specimens 100 mm in diameter 150 mm in height for the constant head seepage test were prepared in colorless transparent acrylic cylinders fig 2 a the bottom edge of each cylinder was stuck by a piece of hard plastic sheet with several small holes fig 2b these holes could avoid the accumulation of excessive pore air pressure which might cease the water seepage and minimize the water loss of soil as much as possible considering one time compaction would cause the soil density uneven and gradually lower from the upper side to the lower part of the soil column due to particle friction this study employed the widely adopted layered compaction method by using tools as shown in fig 2c according to the target ρ d and the height of each compacted layer the soil salt water mixtures of required dosage were weighed and strictly compacted to the target thickness a total of five layers for compaction were scheduled for each soil column to prevent the soil structure from being discontinuous between every two layers the top surface of the finished layer was randomly and densely scratched before compacting the next layer after compaction and before testing the column top was sealed with a piece of hard plastic sheet to prevent water loss 2 3 matric suction measurement for dispersive soil at each η 0 ρ d case listed in table 1 the filter paper method shuangquan 203 produced in china was adopted for establishing the soil water characteristic curve swcc for this purpose six mass water contents including 5 8 11 14 17 and 20 were scheduled the matric suction ψ kpa was calculated based on the following calibration equation wang et al 2003 1 lg ψ 0 0767 ω p 5 493 ω p 47 lg ψ 0 0120 ω p 2 470 ω p 47 where ω p denotes the mass water content of the filter paper afterwards the van genuchten vg model van genuchten 1980 was employed to establish swccs via retc software 2 θ θ r θ s θ r 1 α ψ β 1 1 β where α kpa 1 and β are fitting parameters θ denotes the volumetric water content θ s and θ r denote saturated and residual volumetric water contents respectively note that the θ s was theoretical and only determined by ρ d and the retc would adjust θ r to 0 automatically if it is 0 1 the matric suctions and fitting parameters of swccs are summarized in table 2 note that the θ r of each case was equal to 0 2 4 constant head seepage test a set of self assembled equipment as depicted in fig 3 was employed for the constant head seepage test seeing that the soil hydraulic conductivity is susceptible to temperature the test was carried out in a room with a constant air temperature of 20 regulated by an air conditioner for each experimental case the compacted soil column without demolding from the transparent acrylic cylinder was directly used where the space above the soil column top inside the transparent acrylic cylinder could store water with a certain height to realize the constant head seepage condition a mariotte bottle fixed by an iron stand was centered above the soil column moreover to ensure that the seepage results were not affected by other than the initial ions contained in the soil distilled water was adopted to generate seepage note that before the test started the short outlet tube of the mariotte bottle was tightly closed by a clip to prevent water leakage after it was inverted then by raising or lowering the crossbar of the iron stand the bottom edge of the long outlet tube was adjusted to approximately 2 cm above the soil column top afterward a 4 megapixel hd video camera connected with a monitor and a disk was placed in front of the soil column through which the trajectory of the upcoming wetting front could be tracked in real time before the clip on the mariotte bottle was removed started the video recording and adjusted the focal length to ensure clear details throughout the test the test duration was synchronously recorded in the video according to the working principle of the mariotte bottle when the water column above the soil column top was about 2 cm high the short outlet tube would temporarily stop supplying water then the water supply would not continue until the top surface of the water column was lower than the bottom edge of the long outlet tube as a result of water infiltration into the soil column note that for a 2 cm height of water the pressure it exerted on the soil column was about 0 2 kpa which was a very low value for lean clays at a relatively dry state such a water head could ensure the safe water flow through soil pores without creating apparent pipping holes as for the erosion susceptible dispersive soil under this premise the 2 cm high water was applied for maintaining continuous infiltration only and it was rational to believe that such a low head water did not cause any additional impact on pressure other than supporting infiltration by comparing the real time picture and the playback video when the wetting front moved to the soil column bottom namely after moving 15 cm the test was terminated meanwhile the water supply was immediately stopped and the water remained on the soil column top was removed by using siphons the same operation was applied for all nine experimental cases to guarantee the comparability of test results 2 5 post seepage tests to understand the impact of seepage on particle composition and pore microstructure a representative soil column ρ d 1 44 g cm3 η 0 0 3 after seepage was transversely cut into five layers and sampled at cross section centers for particle size analysis psa and mercury intrusion porosimetry mip tests in the positions shown in fig 4 a five disturbed samples for psa and three undisturbed samples for mip were obtained note that the thickness of the top layer was slightly 3 cm after long term soaking due to the weak expansibility of dispersive soil the psa samples were directly put into a bt 9300ld laser particle sizer fig 4b measurement range 0 1 1000 μm accuracy and repeatability errors 1 for testing before testing in an autopore iv mercury porosimeter fig 4c measurement range 0 003 1100 μm accuracy 0 1 μl the mip samples were successively subjected to 12 hour lyophilization in liquid nitrogen and 12 hour vacuum drying to maintain the original morphology of pore microstructure 3 hydrus 1d simulation of seepage process 3 1 governing equations water flow equation hydrus 1d adopts the richards equation to describe the one dimensional equilibrium water flow in unsaturated media šimůnek et al 2013 for this study the simplified form is 3 θ t z k u h z 1 where t denotes the time z denotes the coordinate along the seepage direction k u denotes the soil unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and h denotes the pressure head solute transport equation hydrus 1d adopts convection dispersion equation to describe the solute transport šimůnek et al 2013 for this study the simplified form for quantifying soluble salt transport is 4 θ c t q c z z θ d z c z where c denotes the concentration of pore soluble salt solution dz denotes the dispersion coefficient considering the poor permeability of dispersive soil ouhadi and goodarzi 2006 the empirical value of 0 5 cm is taken in this simulation q denotes the infiltration rate 3 2 model building and boundary conditions model information each hydrus 1d model representing the 15 cm soil column was equally divided into 301 nodes with a spacing of 0 05 cm the θ 0 η 0 and ρ d table 1 distributed uniformly everywhere and the temperature was constant at 20 the soil unsaturated characteristics were described by the parameters of vg model included in table 2 other necessary parameters were adopted default or recommended values in the software in order to fully understand the change laws of soil properties during seepage for each η 0 ρ d case the total duration of simulated seepage was set at 105 of that of corresponding laboratory test the initial time was 0 the minimum and maximum time steps were set to 0 036 s and 3600 s respectively note that hydrus 1d can automatically adjust the time step according to the number of iterations during simulation process to accelerate convergence in this study the initial time step was set to 0 1 s upper and lower boundaries of water flow because the soil column was under a constant water head of about 2 cm it is assumed that the water head was able to form soon after the mariotte bottle opened for sake of this the upper boundary condition was set as variable water head therein the pressure head was set to 0 only at 0 2 s and then was adjusted to 2 cm at and after 0 3 s until the end of simulation this height will be substituted into the embedded algorithm of hydrus 1d for calculation and then pose influence on the seepage characteristic since the test was terminated when the wetting front moved to the soil column bottom and the perforated hard plastic sheet allowed pore air to escape hence the lower boundary condition was set as free drainage upper and lower boundaries of solute transport since the concentration of distilled water used for water seepage was 0 the upper boundary condition was set as concentration flux to reflect this considering the lower boundary condition of water flow here zero concentration gradient was set for the lower boundary condition in addition since the soluble salt already existed in the soil column ahead of seepage and no extra ion was supplied during seepage in such case only the change of soil pore salt concentration was involved during seepage so the adsorption and reaction of ions were not considered 3 3 model evaluation in each model five monitoring points were set 3 6 9 12 and 15 cm from the soil column top the model was validated by comparing laboratory and simulated test durations when the wetting front reached the selected monitoring points four indexes including nash suttcliffe efficiency coefficient nse willmott index of agreement wia root mean square error rmse and determination coefficient r 2 were jointly adopted for validation 5 n s e 1 i 1 n t e i t s i 2 i 1 n t e i t e 2 6 w i a 1 i 1 n t e i t s i 2 i 1 n t e i t e t s i t e 2 7 r m s e i 1 n t e i t s i 2 n 8 r 2 i 1 n t e i t e t s i t s i 1 n t e i t e 2 i 1 n t s i t s 2 where t e i and t s i denote the laboratory and simulated test durations taken for the wetting front to arrive at the ith monitoring point i 1 2 3 4 5 from soil column top to bottom one by one the total number n 5 respectively t e and t s denote the average values of corresponding five t e i and t s i in each case respectively the closer the nse wia and r 2 are to 1 and the lower the rmse is the higher the authenticity of the model is 4 results and analyses 4 1 movement of wetting front fig 5 displays the positions of the wetting front of each η 0 ρ d case when the elapsed time t 10 min and 24 h two cases for illustration after the start of seepage it can be seen that due to the soil has a dark color the boundaries of several wetting fronts are slightly blurred and not easy to be distinguished with the naked eye therefore during video playback the real time position of the wetting front is determined by sliding the progress bar quickly and repeatedly together adjusting the brightness and contrast obviously the boundary of each wetting front is basically parallel to that of the soil column top reflecting the soil column underwent one dimensional seepage the moving distance of the wetting front ht at different t is recorded in fig 6 a f note that the seepage was fast at first and then slowed down hence the ht was first recorded when t 1 min 5 min 10 min and 30 min next was recorded every 30 min 30 min t 5 h and then was recorded every 1 h t 5 h when ht 15 cm the t is equal to the total test duration t e results show that when η 0 0 3 fig 6a the position of the wetting front of case ρ d 1 44 g cm3 remains the lowest all the time whereas that of the other two cases 1 53 and 1 62 g cm3 kept close for a long period of seepage which reflects in their maximum and average differences in ht are 0 4 and 0 13 cm from 30 min to 90 h of seepage respectively when η 0 1 0 fig 6b the impact of increasing ρ d on ht begins to be conspicuous which is manifested in that the position of the wetting front of case 1 53 g cm3 is obviously lower than that of 1 62 g cm3 and the difference in ht gradually increases as seepage progressing when the former is at its t e the latter is 1 8 cm above the soil column bottom when η 0 2 0 fig 6c the moving laws of the wetting front of three ρ d cases are similar to that of case η 0 1 0 compared with the ρ d effect on the movement of the wetting front under given η 0 the η 0 effect under given ρ d is more distinct fig 6d f since the differences in ht among η 0 cases 0 3 1 0 and 2 0 are more notable at a same t it should be noted that the concentration of pore salt solution changes due to salt leaching and migration hence the influence of soluble salt content discussed in this section refers to that of its initial value η 0 clearly the wetting front of case η 0 0 3 keeps highest at a same t at the initial stage of seepage the difference in ht among soil columns with three η 0 is inapparent then exhibits a gradual increase trend as time goes by the differences in ht between cases η 0 1 0 and 2 0 as shown in fig 6g i are greater than that between cases η 0 0 3 and 1 0 regardless of ρ d reflecting that the increasing η 0 from 0 3 to 2 0 can significantly enhance the permeability of dispersive soil fig 7 summarizes the t e of each η 0 ρ d case fig 7a illustrates that the t e prolongs within a rate range from 4 4 to 38 6 as ρ d increases overall such influence is more notable when the ρ d increases from 1 53 to 1 62 g cm3 fig 7b shows that the increase in η 0 almost linearly shortens the t e specifically when the η 0 increases from 0 3 to 1 0 the t e of cases ρ d 1 44 1 53 and 1 62 g cm3 are shortened by 22 7 32 4 and 19 2 respectively when the η 0 increases from 1 0 to 2 0 they are shortened by 38 2 38 0 and 37 1 respectively consequently the η 0 affects more markedly on the water seepage in unsaturated dispersive soil than ρ d the downward movement of the wetting front is driven both by the gravity and the soil matric suction however the influences of these two aspects are controlled by the initial soil pore microstructure that is if the pores are poorly connected narrow and tortuous when ρ d is high the pore water will be subjected to great resistance during migrating and it needs to ceaselessly break through the equilibrium state of bottleneck effect to move downward this is reflected in that the wetting front stops moving or merely moves very slightly within a certain duration for example the ht of case ρ d 1 44 g cm3 as shown in fig 6a is maintained at 9 5 cm from 44 to 46 h after seepage starts the soil above the wetting front gradually changes from unsaturated to saturated and the saturation rate is closely related to the initial soil physicochemical properties the pore solution is progressively diluted leading to a decrease in the concentration according to the gouy chapman diffuse double layer theory while interacting with water the water film adhered on the surface of clay particles thickens and repels each other then clay aggregates soon disintegrate and occupy the original pore space as a result the pores become smaller with a worse connectivity and the movement of the wetting front slows down a previous study has stated that under constant head seepage condition the hydraulic conductivity of compacted dispersive soil from unsaturated state to saturated state gradually decreases to a relatively steady value han et al 2020 therefore the formation of saturation zone greatly hinders the downward migration of supplemental water that is from the mariotte bottle resulting in the movement of the wetting front slows down with the progress of seepage 4 2 hydrus 1d model performance in simulation with respect to each selected monitoring point when the θ begins to increase it is regarded that the wetting front has reached the current position after the corresponding t the results of simulated t and validation indexes are listed in table 3 the relationship between simulated and laboratory t is depicted in fig 8 a with an r 2 0 99 it can be seen that for each case the nse 0 97 the wia and r 2 both 0 99 in a study by rahman et al 2012 the model was considered to have good performance as the above three indexes were beyond 0 83 0 95 and 0 85 respectively due to the lack of unified criteria based on this published literature and the definitions of three parameters the model authenticity in this study is acceptable rmse can reflect the comprehensive deviation between simulated and laboratory t as can be seen the result ranges from 0 5478 to 4 1911 with an average of 2 0115 which is relatively discrete the evaluation based on rmse needs to be determined in combination with specific problem since hydrus 1d adopts theoretical calculation the numerical solution is usually invariable as long as the initial and boundary conditions remain unchanged however for the seepage test conducted on real soil columns even if with same properties the characteristics of seepage must be differential the local soil heterogeneity and bottleneck effect also affect the water flow in pores besides when the valve of the mariotte bottle is opened the soil at the top has been rapidly wetted and the water is bound to start infiltration before its height reaches 2 cm such initial conditions are very difficult to be set accurately in the simulation therefore the laboratory seepage process will be influenced by many non idealized factors so that the wetting front cannot move to the selected monitoring points in the calculation time according to theoretical prediction which needs to be simplified during the model building finally resulting in a certain error between the simulated and measured t hence certain errors are acceptable because the simulation results still can provide scientific references for deeply understanding the seepage law in dispersive soil by dividing each rmse by t e it can be seen from fig 8b that the maximum proportion of simulation error is 5 2 and the average is 2 8 based on the above validation indexes the simulation results of hydrus 1d are considered to be applicative for further analyses 4 3 variations of water and salt contents at monitoring points fig 9 displays the variations of soil θ and time dependent soluble salt content η at five selected monitoring points 3 6 9 12 and 15 cm from the soil column top during simulated seepage processes overall for a monitoring point the θ shows a sharp increase gradual saturation trend and the η expresses a sharp increase gradual decrease unimodal trend the η reaches its peak ahead of the appearance of θ s it can be seen that the θ and η both suffer salient sudden changes at the monitoring points where the wetting front has just arrived at a higher ρ d the θ and η curves in the increasing stage behave gentler and more nonlinear and there requests more time for θ and η to reach their maxima besides the peak of η curve becomes flatter meanwhile the decrease after the peak becomes slower however the variation characteristics of θ and η at the monitoring point 15 cm from soil column top are obviously different from that of others this is because the lower boundary of water flow is set as the free drainage in the hydrus 1d model and since there is no soil below the sudden acceleration of seepage occurs the simulation results also show that at high ρ d and low η 0 there exists monitoring points that still remain unsaturated when seepage terminates indicating that the saturated state of soil during seepage cannot be simply judged by the arrival of the wetting front this is because the surface adsorption dispersion and breakthrough of bottleneck effect of clay aggregates all occupy time which delays the saturation progress of pores salt transport is based on water transport initially the soluble salt is almost evenly distributed in soil during seepage the soluble salt in the upper soil migrates downward with water flow resulting in the temporary accumulation at a certain depth driven by the supplemental water it continues to be carried downward thereby the salt accumulation phenomenon at current depth gets relieved as shown in fig 9 the salt accumulation is common in all cases and the peak η increases apparently along the seepage direction take fig 9a for illustration after the wetting front moves 3 6 9 12 and 15 cm the peaks of η are 0 575 0 681 0 741 0 778 and 0 841 respectively reflecting the seepage process in dispersive soil can also be deemed as the leaching process of soluble salt moreover at a certain depth if the increase of θ is slow so does the η hence the peak value cannot be reached such as the monitoring points 15 cm from the soil column top shown in fig 9b in addition when η 0 is the same at a same depth the increase in ρ d weakens salt accumulation which is due to the slower water flow through pores the higher head loss along the seepage path and the limited ability of seepage in transporting and dissolving soluble salt 4 4 spatiotemporal profile characteristics hydrus 1d simulation well reproduces the substance migration and permeability characteristics in dispersive soil during seepage and the results reach the accuracy that is difficult to be measured through laboratory tests fig 10 summarizes the profile variations of θ fig 10a c η fig 10d f and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity k u fig 10g i of all dispersive soil column models during simulated seepage noted that each total duration of simulated seepage is equally divided into 201 record nodes and a 15 cm soil column is longitudinally divided into 301 nodes so each case embraces 201 t axis 301 ht axis 60501 data points 4 4 1 volumetric water content as previously mentioned since the lower boundary condition of water flow was set as free drainage there is a sharp drop of θ near the soil column bottom in some cases included in fig 10a c results demonstrate that the greater the ρ d and the lower the η 0 the slower the water diffusion which is consistent with the law obtained from the laboratory test besides the top soil within about 1 cm depth soon reaches its saturation state shortly after the start of seepage with the increase of depth the time required for soil from initially unsaturated state to saturated state gradually prolongs that is the transition zone as marked in fig 10a widens in horizontal and the influence of ρ d is very conspicuous whereas an increase in η 0 plays the opposite role the underlying reason for above findings lies in that when seepage occurs in the upper part of soil column the pore solution concentration decreases the diffuse double layer of clay particles thickens and the existence of dispersity makes the aggregates cemented by clay particles disintegrate and then occupy more pore spaces although the clay particles get released and the volume of their overlapping water film increases the narrowing of pore channels enhances the viscosity of pore wall and the free energy of passing water decreases which weakens the conduction function of overlapping water film to a certain extent therefore the seepage slows down further the saturation speed of the soil in the lower part decreases which is manifested in the deeper the position the longer the time for soil saturation so that the soil below a specific depth in some cases is not able to achieve saturation when the simulated seepage terminates this reveals that the dispersity of dispersive soil subjected to water infiltration makes its saturation progress lag behind 4 4 2 soluble salt content fig 10d f show that soils at different depths first experience salt accumulation and then leaching and the salt accumulation rate is fast indicating that the arrival of the wetting front can cause a rapid rise of η however the leaching rate is much slower which can be identified by the distribution density of isolines it is also found that when seepage terminates the η at the soil column top is not equal to 0 and the lower the η 0 and ρ d the closer it is to 0 although the ion adsorption condition was not considered during model building such result reflects the reality that the soil will not be completely desalinized due to the selective adsorption effect of clay particles in addition the region with most obvious salt accumulation is not necessarily at the soil column bottom and the ρ d and η 0 can promote its upward and downward movement respectively this is due to the gradual enrichment of soluble salts in pore water and limited to soil permeability the amount of supplemental water from the upper part is low thus it is difficult for water to transport all salts downward within a short period meanwhile the salt solubility limits the synchronous changes of water and salt therefore the η displays a low high low distribution from the top to the bottom of soil column indicating that the entire transport of salt lags behind that of water 4 4 3 unsaturated hydraulic conductivity fig 10g i present the spatiotemporal k u distribution of soil column during simulated seepage in practice the magnitude order of k u is more concerned so the k u in the same magnitude order in the figure is marked with the same color results illustrate that the k u at a certain depth increases when seepage progressing after the start of simulated seepage the k u in a higher magnitude order lasts longer an increase in ρ d and η 0 slows down and accelerates the increase of k u respectively and both two factors can change the range of k u for example when ρ d 1 44 g cm3 and η 0 0 3 the magnitude order of k u before and after seepage is between 1e 16 and 1e 8 m s whereas it is between 1e 16 and 1e 7 m s when η 0 increases to 1 0 that is the soil permeability gets enhanced when seepage terminates note that when θ reaches its θ s the k u is equal to the saturated hydraulic conductivity k sat as given in fig 11 for all experimental cases the k sat varies within the range between 1e 8 and 3e 7 m s moreover the magnitude order of three cases is 1e 7 m s and the other five are 1e 8 m s implying the dominant magnitude order of k sat is 1e 8 m s 4 5 profile changes after seepage the representative soil column with ρ d 1 44 g cm3 and η 0 0 3 after laboratory seepage test was sampled fig 4a to explore the post seepage profile changes in particle composition and pore microstructure 4 5 1 particle composition fig 12 a shows the test results of soil particle size distribution including cumulative and incremental distribution curves each incremental distribution curve exhibits an obvious bimodal shape with peaks a and b whose corresponding particle sizes are near the boundaries of clay silt and silt sand groups respectively and the inflection particle size between the two peaks is near 10 μm the incremental percentages at two peaks change regularly along the seepage direction from p1 to p5 top to bottom fig 4a their incremental percentages at peak a increase monotonously on the whole and that of sample p1 can still be distinguished from the other four even when the particle size is as low as 0 5 μm besides the order at peak b is just opposite to that at peak a this change law reveals that the water flow in pores is able to carry fine clay particles downward thus leading to an increasing relative proportion of silt and sand in situ in soil columns which is the results of the dispersion of dispersive soil particles combined with the laboratory and simulated results it can be reasonably speculated that the increasing ρ d and η 0 may weaken and enhance such changes respectively fig 12b shows the variations of three characteristic particle sizes d 10 d 30 and d 60 corresponding to cumulative percentages of 10 30 and 60 respectively it can be seen that the three all behave a decreasing trend along the seepage direction reflecting that the proportion of fine particles is more where closer to the soil column bottom which is the result of the downward migration of fine particles dragged by water flow fig 12c presents the cc and cu along the seepage direction the cc decreases singly from p1 to p5 with values between 1 2 0 6 the cu shows a trend of first increasing p1 p2 and then decreasing p2 p5 with values 16 so these samples are poorly graded except for p1 since the natural dispersive soil for testing is also poorly graded fig 1 above result suggests that the seepage process mainly changes the homogeneity of top soil within about 3 cm this is related to the earlier saturation occurred within such a depth and subsequent continuous loss of fine particles besides the weak permeability of dispersive soil is also believed to restrict the significant change in soil homogeneity to a certain extent above phenomenon warns that even under such a low head of 2 cm the dispersive soil can still experience detectable particle loss suggesting that the critical hydraulic gradient when dispersive soil forming internal erosion may be extremely low 4 5 2 pore microstructure the mip results of three samples m1 m3 and m5 along the seepage direction are shown in fig 13 a the measured pore size ranges from 0 006 to 350 μm according to the cumulative pore volume curves the total volume of m1 0 4018 ml g is significantly higher than that of m3 0 2796 ml g and m5 0 2747 ml g and that of m3 and m5 are close proving that the seepage mainly affects the pore microstructure near the soil column top within t e the incremental pore volume curves behave bimodal characteristics as a whole the pore size ranges corresponding to the two peaks of m1 are 0 1 20 and 20 350 μm respectively the two peaks of m3 and m5 almost coincide and their ranges are 0 1 5 and 5 350 μm respectively this shows that the seepage has transformed some larger pores right peak into smaller pores left peak near m1 leading to a significant increase in the volume of smaller pores however compared with m3 and m5 the incremental volume curve of m1 moves towards the right side and the pore diameters corresponding to the two peaks increase as a whole reflecting the occurrence of structural collapse of soil skeleton due to dispersion while interacting with water so that the larger pores are filled with dispersed soil particles and then isolated into smaller pores the reason why the pore sizes corresponding to the two peaks of m1 are still higher than that of m3 and m5 is not only determined by the disintegration and downward movement of dispersive clay particles but also related to the weak expansibility of clay minerals under low overburden pressure fig 13b shows the changes of porosity and tortuosity included in mip results of three samples which perform symmetric trends the m1 has the highest porosity 51 0 and lowest tortuosity 4 7201 and the m3 and m5 have close porosity 42 3 43 0 respectively and tortuosity 6 6311 6 0196 respectively a higher tortuosity means that a longer and more curved seepage path exists between two random positions in soil hence a greater viscous resistance needs to be overcome for water flow on the contrary an increase in porosity indicates that some pores in soil are connected inducing the pore channel wider and straighter hence the randomness of water flow moving downward is reduced which is conducive to seepage it can be seen that the average pore diameter shown in fig 13c is larger near the soil column top m1 0 173 μm but there are little changes in another two parts m3 0 113 μm and m5 0 109 μm which echoes the change of porosity presented in fig 13b similarly the backbone fractal dimension shown in fig 13c is obviously different only at m1 2 444 whereas that of m3 and m5 are close 2 808 and 2 787 respectively suggesting that a longer period of seepage can simplify the skeleton of dispersive soil above changes demonstrate that fine particles in dispersive soil will migrate downward during seepage then lead to a loss of fine particles near the soil column top combined with the laboratory and simulated results it can be reasonably inferred that when ρ d and η 0 increase the affected region of soil pore microstructure might be thinner and thicker respectively 5 discussions the process and consequence when water flowing through soils have long been an interesting and important topic especially when solving seepage induced soil failure problems both experimental and analytic approaches were booming in describing the seepage characteristics of different soil types from the second half of the last century for instance klute 1965 assembled a simple apparatus for measuring soil hydraulic conductivity based on the constant head principle biswas et al 1966 analyzed the basic processes of water redistribution of agricultural soils experimentally warrick et al 1971 presented numerical equations for describing the displacement of solutes during infiltration with calibration of experiment data gumbs and warkentin 1972 found a small increase in bulk density of soil column markedly slowed down the inside water movement under a 1 5 cm constant water head seepage regime van den berg 1989 successfully obtained the hydraulic conductivity of silt loam soil columns by employing the infiltration method with a mariotte bottle which was used for creating a 1 3 cm constant head and the methodology of the current study was like theirs in particular the implementation of soil column tests has helped solve soil hydro physical problems chen et al 2021 dikinya et al 2008 mohammadzadeh habili and heidarpour 2015 yang et al 2004 moreover since the hydrus series codes were released many complex progresses including water flow and solute transport have been better understood in unsaturated soils inoue et al 2000 ma et al 2010 shaygan et al 2018 the combined applications of physical tests and numerical simulations gradually became a mature methodology in dealing with the soil water salt interaction processes however the coverage of soil types especially the water sensitive soils that are easy to induce serious engineering problems is not comprehensive and the experimental verification of soil changes at the micro level is insufficient either let alone consider the plus of important soil variables dispersive soil as a water sensitive special soil has greatly threatened the stability of earthen engineering structures in the current study area han et al 2022a and the failure it caused is inseparable from its seepage process which indirectly determines the spatial scale of hydro failure this has become the primary motivation for conducting this study dispersive soils have been found inseparable from plenty of hydro failures of earthen structures worldwide which attracts researchers to examine the function of different additions on inhibiting soil dispersion in previous studies consoli nilo et al 2021 vakili et al 2018a 2021 but how water and soluble salt transport in it during infiltration have been overlooked the refined characterization of the dynamic seepage process as well as its consequence in dispersive soil is the prominent feature of this study and the impacts of two common but important factors were evaluated the seepage characteristics of dispersive soil with analyses of the spatiotemporal variation law and underlying mechanism can promote a more in depth understanding of the soil water interaction process of dispersive soil and further provide new insights for the targeted prevention and control of dispersive soil catastrophes furthermore for the building and experimental verification of complex multi physical field coupling models the results of this study may also be used as positive references it is well known that the measurement of permeation parameters of soils is very sensitive to methodology hence this study has initially tried to ensure the quality of the results presented from the following five aspects 1 careful preparation of dispersive soil soluble salt water mixtures 2 careful compaction of dispersive soil columns 3 stable water supply equipment to maintain a constant head during seepage 4 reasonable selection of boundary conditions for hydrus 1d simulation 5 well accepted instruments for analyzing soil particle and pore distributions yet it should be appreciated that the results presented in this study were obtained by applying a 2 cm water head on the 15 cm dispersive soil columns by comparison the height of the soil column seems insufficient therefore the pressure effect of the ponding water on the soil column top as well as the size effect might impact the results however according to the mohr coulomb criteria the cohesion of soil is equal to its shear strength when no external stress is applied since the cohesion of lean clay with sand at a relatively dry state is usually at a level of at least several tens of kpa especially when the soil ω 0 is below the plastic limit ω 0 11 18 2 in this study the head pressure of 0 2 kpa on the soil column top due to the 2 cm layer of water was almost negligible to the modification of soil structure and did not cause any additional impact on pressure other than supporting uninterrupted infiltration generally speaking under the constant head seepage condition the head height mainly affects the duration of water flowing through a soil column at a given height below the critical water head that can induce piping in dispersive soil a higher water head will accelerate the water flow additionally the length of soil column affects the time required for water to flow out from its bottom when the height of soil column is fully extended and the 2 cm water head becomes insignificant such change mainly prolongs the t e and the relativity of seepage law between different η 0 and ρ d will not change significantly despite this how the scale effect between water head and soil column size influences the seepage characteristics is worth further exploration the follow up related research is expected to better meet the understanding of the seepage characteristics of dispersive soil under different engineering and hydraulic boundary conditions 6 conclusions this study explored the seepage characteristics in unsaturated dispersive soil columns by combining the laboratory constant head seepage test and hydrus 1d simulation effects of three levels of initial soil soluble salt content η 0 0 3 1 0 and 2 0 and dry density ρ d 1 44 1 53 and 1 62 g cm3 were considered emphases were paid on the redistributions of water salt and permeability of dispersive soil the seepage induced particle composition and pore microstructure changes were analyzed based on a representative soil column the predominant conclusions are summarized as follows 1 under a constant head the wetting front moves fast first and then slow in unsaturated dispersive soil there exhibits a power relationship between the moving distance and the elapsed seepage time 2 soluble salt plays a harmful role when η 0 increases an increase of its increment can accelerate the seepage process in current test the η 0 increasing from 0 3 to 1 0 and from 1 0 to 2 0 lead to 19 2 32 4 and at least 37 1 of reductions in the total seepage duration respectively by contrast the impact of ρ d is weaker and opposite to that of η 0 overall 3 the arrival of the wetting front can cause a surge in volumetric water content θ and a rapid increase in soluble salt content η an increase in ρ d significantly delays the salt leaching process the η reaches its maximum ahead of θ at the end of seepage the region with the most severe salt accumulation does not necessarily appear at the soil column bottom 4 within the scope of this study the magnitude order of hydraulic conductivity ranges between 1e 16 to 1e 7 m s when the dispersive soil evolves from initially unsaturated to saturated states mainly 1e 8 m s an increase in ρ d and η 0 weakens and enhances the permeability of dispersive soil respectively 5 even if under a low water head seepage is able to promote the downward migration of fine particles due to the existence of soil dispersity so as to simplify the pore microstructure near the soil column top reflecting that the unstable skeleton of dispersive soil makes the seepage features unsteady evolution this also suggests that the threshold hydraulic gradient corresponding to the formation of internal erosion in dispersive soil can be quite low 6 inspired by the obtained findings in dispersive soil adopting the technology of preventing the upward migration of soluble salt underground and improving the compaction degree can both effectively prevent the occurrence of erosion problems such as piping credit authorship contribution statement yan han writing original draft methodology

2830,seepage in dispersive soils has contributed to inducing severe damage to hydraulic structures worldwide whereas its targeted quantitative and refined characterizations have long been overlooked this study jointly adopted the laboratory constant head seepage test and hydrus 1d simulation to explore the dynamic seepage behavior in compacted unsaturated salt affected dispersive soil columns lean clay with sand the impacts of two crucial factors including initial soil soluble salt content η 0 0 3 1 0 2 0 and dry density ρ d 1 44 1 53 1 62 g cm3 were considered the matric suction of each experimental case was measured to characterize initial unsaturation and the post seepage particle and pore distributions of a representative case were measured to clarify the seepage consequence furthermore the spatiotemporal evolutions of water soluble salt and hydraulic conductivity during seepage were captured laboratory results suggested that the advance of the wetting front conformed to a power function increasing η 0 and ρ d reduced and prolonged the total test duration by 19 2 38 2 and 4 4 38 6 respectively since dispersive soil features a water sensitive skeleton fine particles could be dragged downward by water flow thus simplifying the pore microstructure near the soil column top under such a low head of 2 cm here this finding implied that the threshold hydraulic gradient corresponding to the formation of internal erosion in dispersive soil can be quite low based on simulation results rapid salt accumulation formed where the wetting front arrived in contrast to the following slower leaching process higher η 0 contributed to stronger permeability the magnitude order of hydraulic conductivity ranged between 10 16 and 10 7 m s from initially unsaturated state to saturated state and that of saturated soil was mainly 10 8 m s reflecting the poor permeability of dispersive soil these novel findings are expected to deepen the soil water interaction understanding

dispersive soil as a worldwide distributed special soil has become a global concern in water conservancy construction over the last two decades its particularity lies in that while encountering water especially with low salinity the soil particles soon lose their most cohesion and then disintegrate into primary particles the clay particles suspended in water in form of colloid without coagulation resulting in a rapid breakdown of soil structure due to the loss in cementitious material bell and walker 2000 fan and kong 2013 quiñónez samaniego et al 2021 zorluer et al 2010 up to now most efforts with respect to dispersive soil were put into soil improvement by utilizing multifarious chemical or biological additives unfortunately although the dispersity is only shown when interacting with water the insight of its hydro physical properties has not made conspicuous progress dispersive soil mainly destroys the landscape or functional engineering structures in the manner of erosion fell et al 2003 garcía ruiz et al 1997 han et al 2022a masoodi et al 2019 premkumar et al 2016 rui et al 2019 wang and song 2022 and internal erosion failure is prone to be formed in dispersive soil subjected to seepage vakili et al 2020 the erosion consequences induced by seepage are easily identifiable but the seepage characteristics when water transports in soil pores remain qualitative and ambiguous hence it is necessary to conduct purposeful explorations regarding dispersive soil seepage in the aeration zone is one of the most frequently discussed natural hydrologic phenomena on the earth driven by gravity and soil suctions liquid water migrates in the pores and cracks of unsaturated soil and further affects soil properties via increasing saturation yoshimoto et al 2011 and dispersing transporting particles zuo et al 2020 plenty of soil failures are triggered by the seepage process such as erosion chu agor et al 2008 owoputi and stolte 2001 pipping richards and reddy 2012 shallow landslides kim et al 2018 dam deformation jiang et al 2020 li and ming 2004 etc especially when water content and matric suction suffer changes under rainfall situation park 2016 unraveling the seepage characteristics of water in unsaturated soil is the first step to scientifically deal with these disasters whose estimation plays a crucial role in executing unsaturated saturated mass transfer analyses sako and kitamura 2006 in view of the scarce research on the seepage of dispersive soil that of other soil types may well enlighten the current study for instance lin et al 2019 carried out a long term seepage test on loess and observed that the soluble salt migrated and redistributed with water and then leads to structural changes she et al 2019 confirmed that divalent cations in the upper part of expansive soil migrated downward with water flow under unidirectional seepage zeng et al 2020 noticed that when performing column test the seepage velocity close to the container wall was faster than that in the middle at a cross section qin et al 2022 proposed that the seepage process in loess under single point water supply could be divided into four stages including rapid stable slow and preferential infiltration periods in addition numerical simulation can help obtain some necessary parameters that are difficult to accurately capture via laboratory seepage tests such as the widely used hydrus 1d code for solving one dimensional infiltration problems amini et al 2020 ngo cong et al 2021 rahmati et al 2020 young et al 2002 thus the combined application of laboratory test and numerical simulation is believed to provide more convincing and detailed results which is worth trying to understand the to be revealed seepage process in dispersive soil dispersive soil usually contains certain amounts of soluble salt abbaslou et al 2016 compared to anions the cations influence soil properties more as the mainstream indexes used to evaluate dispersity are mainly derived from cations such as sar cross rengasamy and marchuk 2011 charge sparsity melo et al 2020 etc whose valence and quantity thins or thickens the diffuse double layer adhered on the surface of clay particles by alternating the electric potential therein the enrichment of sodium ion is one of the generally accepted essential reasons for soil dispersity gutiérrez et al 2003 marchuk and rengasamy 2011 vakili et al 2018b which has often been discussed in relevant studies since it relates to the erosion initiation and particle breakdown ramezanpour et al 2010 it can be rationally speculated that the redistribution of soluble salt caused by seepage will change the local dispersion potential of dispersive soil so as to change the location of hidden dangers and conversely the change in soil salinity might also impact the seepage field by transforming soil structure therefore it is necessary to consider the influence of soil salinity while studying the seepage characteristics of dispersive soil despite the hydraulic conductivity and its pore scale mechanism of unsaturated dispersive soil in a cold arid region were defined and elaborated han et al 2022b han et al 2020 in which the soil salinity was found crucial to govern the seepage speed this is not enough to describe the dynamic migrations of water and soluble salt since the migration of water and salt in soil is a very complex process zhang et al 2021b the law of how soluble salt migrates with water flow through dispersive soil deserves to investigate besides plus the effect caused by soil density which is a factor often considered in hydraulic constructions the seepage characteristics might be more interesting and complicated aiming at the existing research deficiencies in this study the dynamic seepage process and its consequence in dispersive soil with different initial soluble salt contents and dry densities were investigated by integrating laboratory constant head seepage tests and hydrus 1d numerical simulations two key scientific problems are expected to be unraveled via this work 1 experimental characterization of the seepage law in unsaturated dispersive soil and its refined descriptions based on water salt and permeability redistributions 2 variations in particle composition and microstructure of the water sensitive dispersive soil induced by the seepage process the findings to be obtained may advance a more in depth understanding of the soil water interaction characteristics of dispersive soil that was seldom focused on before 2 laboratory experiments 2 1 soil properties the particle size distribution of dispersive soil samples collected at 123 56 42 e 44 59 58 n in qian an ne china is shown in fig 1 the sand silt and clay particles accounted for 17 73 61 38 and 20 89 of the total respectively according to the conventional criterion that the uniformity coefficient cu d 60 d 10 5 and curvature coefficient cc d 30 2 d 10 d 60 1 3 refers to well graded soil the soil was poorly graded since its cu and cc were 15 07 and 0 64 respectively the particle density was 2 64 g cm3 the maximum dry density was 1 80 g cm3 the plastic and liquid limits were 18 2 and 33 3 respectively the soil was grouped as lean clay with sand as per the unified soil classification system astm 2017 by using 1 5 soil water extract the total soluble salt content was 0 169 na and hco3 were dominant cation and anion with contents of 19 12 and 17 40 mmol kg respectively the total dissolved salts tds k na ca2 mg2 was 4 44 meq l dispersity indexes including sodium adsorption ratio sar percentage sodium ps and cation exchange capacity were 7 2 86 1 and 11 10 cmolc kg respectively the ph was 8 83 the dispersity of this soil sample could be verified from three criteria 1 it was located in the dispersive zone on the tds ps chart sherard et al 1972 2 the sar was 2 4 times the threshold related to spontaneous dispersion of soil as suggested by rengasamy et al 1984 3 the ps exceeded 50 and then could be regarded as dispersive according to astm 2018 2 2 soil column preparation since the sampling site locates in a typical seasonally frozen semiarid salinized region zhang et al 2021a the fluctuating soil salinity is a non ignorable factor when discussing the permeability of dispersive soil han et al 2020 in addition not only for the hydraulic construction needs regional freeze thaw cycling also affects the soil permeability through changing its density based on these practical considerations soluble salt content η 0 mass ratio and dry density ρ d were chosen as variables in this study referring to the experience of pre experiments the initial mass water content ω 0 was set as 11 to concurrently ensure that 1 the soil was in an unsaturated state 2 effective cementation could be formed between soil particles and 3 the wetting front was easy to observe the experimental scheme including all nine cases is listed in table 1 soil samples were successively air dried crushed pulverized sieved 2 mm and evenly mixed such a series of treatments was to avoid the formation of local abnormal soil structure after compaction which might severely influence the trajectory of pore water flow based on the dominant composition of ions analytical pure sodium bicarbonate powder was added to achieve the required η 0 considering the clayey soil is sensitive to the amount of salt ions the dosage accuracy of sodium bicarbonate powder was 0 0001 g distilled water in calculated dosage was used to cement the evenly blended dry soil salt mixtures with the aid of a sprayer to obtain a uniform distribution of salt and water the humidified mixtures were then sealed and cured in a 20 incubator for 24 h column specimens 100 mm in diameter 150 mm in height for the constant head seepage test were prepared in colorless transparent acrylic cylinders fig 2 a the bottom edge of each cylinder was stuck by a piece of hard plastic sheet with several small holes fig 2b these holes could avoid the accumulation of excessive pore air pressure which might cease the water seepage and minimize the water loss of soil as much as possible considering one time compaction would cause the soil density uneven and gradually lower from the upper side to the lower part of the soil column due to particle friction this study employed the widely adopted layered compaction method by using tools as shown in fig 2c according to the target ρ d and the height of each compacted layer the soil salt water mixtures of required dosage were weighed and strictly compacted to the target thickness a total of five layers for compaction were scheduled for each soil column to prevent the soil structure from being discontinuous between every two layers the top surface of the finished layer was randomly and densely scratched before compacting the next layer after compaction and before testing the column top was sealed with a piece of hard plastic sheet to prevent water loss 2 3 matric suction measurement for dispersive soil at each η 0 ρ d case listed in table 1 the filter paper method shuangquan 203 produced in china was adopted for establishing the soil water characteristic curve swcc for this purpose six mass water contents including 5 8 11 14 17 and 20 were scheduled the matric suction ψ kpa was calculated based on the following calibration equation wang et al 2003 1 lg ψ 0 0767 ω p 5 493 ω p 47 lg ψ 0 0120 ω p 2 470 ω p 47 where ω p denotes the mass water content of the filter paper afterwards the van genuchten vg model van genuchten 1980 was employed to establish swccs via retc software 2 θ θ r θ s θ r 1 α ψ β 1 1 β where α kpa 1 and β are fitting parameters θ denotes the volumetric water content θ s and θ r denote saturated and residual volumetric water contents respectively note that the θ s was theoretical and only determined by ρ d and the retc would adjust θ r to 0 automatically if it is 0 1 the matric suctions and fitting parameters of swccs are summarized in table 2 note that the θ r of each case was equal to 0 2 4 constant head seepage test a set of self assembled equipment as depicted in fig 3 was employed for the constant head seepage test seeing that the soil hydraulic conductivity is susceptible to temperature the test was carried out in a room with a constant air temperature of 20 regulated by an air conditioner for each experimental case the compacted soil column without demolding from the transparent acrylic cylinder was directly used where the space above the soil column top inside the transparent acrylic cylinder could store water with a certain height to realize the constant head seepage condition a mariotte bottle fixed by an iron stand was centered above the soil column moreover to ensure that the seepage results were not affected by other than the initial ions contained in the soil distilled water was adopted to generate seepage note that before the test started the short outlet tube of the mariotte bottle was tightly closed by a clip to prevent water leakage after it was inverted then by raising or lowering the crossbar of the iron stand the bottom edge of the long outlet tube was adjusted to approximately 2 cm above the soil column top afterward a 4 megapixel hd video camera connected with a monitor and a disk was placed in front of the soil column through which the trajectory of the upcoming wetting front could be tracked in real time before the clip on the mariotte bottle was removed started the video recording and adjusted the focal length to ensure clear details throughout the test the test duration was synchronously recorded in the video according to the working principle of the mariotte bottle when the water column above the soil column top was about 2 cm high the short outlet tube would temporarily stop supplying water then the water supply would not continue until the top surface of the water column was lower than the bottom edge of the long outlet tube as a result of water infiltration into the soil column note that for a 2 cm height of water the pressure it exerted on the soil column was about 0 2 kpa which was a very low value for lean clays at a relatively dry state such a water head could ensure the safe water flow through soil pores without creating apparent pipping holes as for the erosion susceptible dispersive soil under this premise the 2 cm high water was applied for maintaining continuous infiltration only and it was rational to believe that such a low head water did not cause any additional impact on pressure other than supporting infiltration by comparing the real time picture and the playback video when the wetting front moved to the soil column bottom namely after moving 15 cm the test was terminated meanwhile the water supply was immediately stopped and the water remained on the soil column top was removed by using siphons the same operation was applied for all nine experimental cases to guarantee the comparability of test results 2 5 post seepage tests to understand the impact of seepage on particle composition and pore microstructure a representative soil column ρ d 1 44 g cm3 η 0 0 3 after seepage was transversely cut into five layers and sampled at cross section centers for particle size analysis psa and mercury intrusion porosimetry mip tests in the positions shown in fig 4 a five disturbed samples for psa and three undisturbed samples for mip were obtained note that the thickness of the top layer was slightly 3 cm after long term soaking due to the weak expansibility of dispersive soil the psa samples were directly put into a bt 9300ld laser particle sizer fig 4b measurement range 0 1 1000 μm accuracy and repeatability errors 1 for testing before testing in an autopore iv mercury porosimeter fig 4c measurement range 0 003 1100 μm accuracy 0 1 μl the mip samples were successively subjected to 12 hour lyophilization in liquid nitrogen and 12 hour vacuum drying to maintain the original morphology of pore microstructure 3 hydrus 1d simulation of seepage process 3 1 governing equations water flow equation hydrus 1d adopts the richards

denotes the infiltration rate 3 2 model building and boundary conditions model information each hydrus 1d model representing the 15 cm soil column was equally divided into 301 nodes with a spacing of 0 05 cm the θ 0 η 0 and ρ d table 1 distributed uniformly everywhere and the temperature was constant at 20 the soil unsaturated characteristics were described by the parameters of vg model included in table 2 other necessary parameters were adopted default or recommended values in the software in order to fully understand the change laws of soil properties during seepage for each η 0 ρ d case the total duration of simulated seepage was set at 105 of that of corresponding laboratory test the initial time was 0 the minimum and maximum time steps were set to 0 036 s and 3600 s respectively note that hydrus 1d can automatically adjust the time step according to the number of iterations during simulation process to accelerate convergence in this study the initial time step was set to 0 1 s upper and lower boundaries of water flow because the soil column was under a constant water head of about 2 cm it is assumed that the water head was able to form soon after the mariotte bottle opened for sake of this the upper boundary condition was set as variable water head therein the pressure head was set to 0 only at 0 2 s and then was adjusted to 2 cm at and after 0 3 s until the end of simulation this height will be substituted into the embedded algorithm of hydrus 1d for calculation and then pose influence on the seepage characteristic since the test was terminated when the wetting front moved to the soil column bottom and the perforated hard plastic sheet allowed pore air to escape hence the lower boundary condition was set as free drainage upper and lower boundaries of solute transport since the concentration of distilled water used for water seepage was 0 the upper boundary condition was set as concentration flux to reflect this considering the lower boundary condition of water flow here zero concentration gradient was set for the lower boundary condition in addition since the soluble salt already existed in the soil column ahead of seepage and no extra ion was supplied during seepage in such case only the change of soil pore salt concentration was involved during seepage so the adsorption and reaction of ions were not considered 3 3 model evaluation in each model five monitoring points were set 3 6 9 12 and 15 cm from the soil column top the model was validated by comparing laboratory and simulated test durations when the wetting front reached the selected monitoring points four indexes including nash suttcliffe efficiency coefficient nse willmott index of agreement wia root mean square error rmse and determination coefficient r 2 were

column top to bottom one by one the total number n 5 respectively t e and t s denote the average values of corresponding five t e i and t s i in each case respectively the closer the nse wia and r 2 are to 1 and the lower the rmse is the higher the authenticity of the model is 4 results and analyses 4 1 movement of wetting front fig 5 displays the positions of the wetting front of each η 0 ρ d case when the elapsed time t 10 min and 24 h two cases for illustration after the start of seepage it can be seen that due to the soil has a dark color the boundaries of several wetting fronts are slightly blurred and not easy to be distinguished with the naked eye therefore during video playback the real time position of the wetting front is determined by sliding the progress bar quickly and repeatedly together adjusting the brightness and contrast obviously the boundary of each wetting front is basically parallel to that of the soil column top reflecting the soil column underwent one dimensional seepage the moving distance of the wetting front ht at different t is recorded in fig 6 a f note that the seepage was fast at first and then slowed down hence the ht was first recorded when t 1 min 5 min 10 min and 30 min next was recorded every 30 min 30 min t 5 h and then was recorded every 1 h t 5 h when ht 15 cm the t is equal to the total test duration t e results show that when η 0 0 3 fig 6a the position of the wetting front of case ρ d 1 44 g cm3 remains the lowest all the time whereas that of the other two cases 1 53 and 1 62 g cm3 kept close for a long period of seepage which reflects in their maximum and average differences in ht are 0 4 and 0 13 cm from 30 min to 90 h of seepage respectively when η 0 1 0 fig 6b the impact of increasing ρ d on ht begins to be conspicuous which is manifested in that the position of the wetting front of case 1 53 g cm3 is obviously lower than that of 1 62 g cm3 and the difference in ht gradually increases as seepage progressing when the former is at its t e the latter is 1 8 cm above the soil column bottom when η 0 2 0 fig 6c the moving laws of the wetting front of three ρ d cases are similar to that of case η 0 1 0 compared with the ρ d effect on the movement of the wetting front under given η 0 the η 0 effect under given ρ d is more distinct fig 6d f since the differences in ht among η 0 cases 0 3 1 0 and 2 0 are more notable at a same t it should be noted that the concentration of pore salt solution changes due to salt leaching and migration hence the influence of soluble salt content discussed in this section refers to that of its initial value η 0 clearly the wetting front of case η 0 0 3 keeps highest at a same t at the initial stage of seepage the difference in ht among soil columns with three η 0 is inapparent then exhibits a gradual increase trend as time goes by the differences in ht between cases η 0 1 0 and 2 0 as shown in fig 6g i are greater than that between cases η 0 0 3 and 1 0 regardless of ρ d reflecting that the increasing η 0 from 0 3 to 2 0 can significantly enhance the permeability of dispersive soil fig 7 summarizes the t e of each η 0 ρ d case fig 7a illustrates that the t e prolongs within a rate range from 4 4 to 38 6 as ρ d increases overall such influence is more notable when the ρ d increases from 1 53 to 1 62 g cm3 fig 7b shows that the increase in η 0 almost linearly shortens the t e specifically when the η 0 increases from 0 3 to 1 0 the t e of cases ρ d 1 44 1 53 and 1 62 g cm3 are shortened by 22 7 32 4 and 19 2 respectively when the η 0 increases from 1 0 to 2 0 they are shortened by 38 2 38 0 and 37 1 respectively consequently the η 0 affects more markedly on the water seepage in unsaturated dispersive soil than ρ d the downward movement of the wetting front is driven both by the gravity and the soil matric suction however the influences of these two aspects are controlled by the initial soil pore microstructure that is if the pores are poorly connected narrow and tortuous when ρ d is high the pore water will be subjected to great resistance during migrating and it needs to ceaselessly break through the equilibrium state of bottleneck effect to move downward this is reflected in that the wetting front stops moving or merely moves very slightly within a certain duration for example the ht of case ρ d 1 44 g cm3 as shown in fig 6a is maintained at 9 5 cm from 44 to 46 h after seepage starts the soil above the wetting front gradually changes from unsaturated to saturated and the saturation rate is closely related to the initial soil physicochemical properties the pore solution is progressively diluted leading to a decrease in the concentration according to the gouy chapman diffuse double layer theory while interacting with water the water film adhered on the surface of clay particles thickens and repels each other then clay aggregates soon disintegrate and occupy the original pore space as a result the pores become smaller with a worse connectivity and the movement of the wetting front slows down a previous study has stated that under constant head seepage condition the hydraulic conductivity of compacted dispersive soil from unsaturated state to saturated state gradually decreases to a relatively steady value han et al 2020 therefore the formation of saturation zone greatly hinders the downward migration of supplemental water that is from the mariotte bottle resulting in the movement of the wetting front slows down with the progress of seepage 4 2 hydrus 1d model performance in simulation with respect to each selected monitoring point when the θ begins to increase it is regarded that the wetting front has reached the current position after the corresponding t the results of simulated t and validation indexes are listed in table 3 the relationship between simulated and laboratory t is depicted in fig 8 a with an r 2 0 99 it can be seen that for each case the nse 0 97 the wia and r 2 both 0 99 in a study by rahman et al 2012 the model was considered to have good performance as the above three indexes were beyond 0 83 0 95 and 0 85 respectively due to the lack of unified criteria based on this published literature and the definitions of three parameters the model authenticity in this study is acceptable rmse can reflect the comprehensive deviation between simulated and laboratory t as can be seen the result ranges from 0 5478 to 4 1911 with an average of 2 0115 which is relatively discrete the evaluation based on rmse needs to be determined in combination with specific problem since hydrus 1d adopts theoretical calculation the numerical solution is usually invariable as long as the initial and boundary conditions remain unchanged however for the seepage test conducted on real soil columns even if with same properties the characteristics of seepage must be differential the local soil heterogeneity and bottleneck effect also affect the water flow in pores besides when the valve of the mariotte bottle is opened the soil at the top has been rapidly wetted and the water is bound to start infiltration before its height reaches 2 cm such initial conditions are very difficult to be set accurately in the simulation therefore the laboratory seepage process will be influenced by many non idealized factors so that the wetting front cannot move to the selected monitoring points in the calculation time according to theoretical prediction which needs to be simplified during the model building finally resulting in a certain error between the simulated and measured t hence certain errors are acceptable because the simulation results still can provide scientific references for deeply understanding the seepage law in dispersive soil by dividing each rmse by t e it can be seen from fig 8b that the maximum proportion of simulation error is 5 2 and the average is 2 8 based on the above validation indexes the simulation results of hydrus 1d are considered to be applicative for further analyses 4 3 variations of water and salt contents at monitoring points fig 9 displays the variations of soil θ and time dependent soluble salt content η at five selected monitoring points 3 6 9 12 and 15 cm from the soil column top during simulated seepage processes overall for a monitoring point the θ shows a sharp increase gradual saturation trend and the η expresses a sharp increase gradual decrease unimodal trend the η reaches its peak ahead of the appearance of θ s it can be seen that the θ and η both suffer salient sudden changes at the monitoring points where the wetting front has just arrived at a higher ρ d the θ and η curves in the increasing stage behave gentler and more nonlinear and there requests more time for θ and η to reach their maxima besides the peak of η curve becomes flatter meanwhile the decrease after the peak becomes slower however the variation characteristics of θ and η at the monitoring point 15 cm from soil column top are obviously different from that of others this is because the lower boundary of water flow is set as the free drainage in the hydrus 1d model and since there is no soil below the sudden acceleration of seepage occurs the simulation results also show that at high ρ d and low η 0 there exists monitoring points that still remain unsaturated when seepage terminates indicating that the saturated state of soil during seepage cannot be simply judged by the arrival of the wetting front this is because the surface adsorption dispersion and breakthrough of bottleneck effect of clay aggregates all occupy time which delays the saturation progress of pores salt transport is based on water transport initially the soluble salt is almost evenly distributed in soil during seepage the soluble salt in the upper soil migrates downward with water flow resulting in the temporary accumulation at a certain depth driven by the supplemental water it continues to be carried downward thereby the salt accumulation phenomenon at current depth gets relieved as shown in fig 9 the salt accumulation is common in all cases and the peak η increases apparently along the seepage direction take fig 9a for illustration after the wetting front moves 3 6 9 12 and 15 cm the peaks of η are 0 575 0 681 0 741 0 778 and 0 841 respectively reflecting the seepage process in dispersive soil can also be deemed as the leaching process of soluble salt moreover at a certain depth if the increase of θ is slow so does the η hence the peak value cannot be reached such as the monitoring points 15 cm from the soil column top shown in fig 9b in addition when η 0 is the same at a same depth the increase in ρ d weakens salt accumulation which is due to the slower water flow through pores the higher head loss along the seepage path and the limited ability of seepage in transporting and dissolving soluble salt 4 4 spatiotemporal profile characteristics hydrus 1d simulation well reproduces the substance migration and permeability characteristics in dispersive soil during seepage and the results reach the accuracy that is difficult to be measured through laboratory tests fig 10 summarizes the profile variations of θ fig 10a c η fig 10d f and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity k u fig 10g i of all dispersive soil column models during simulated seepage noted that each total duration of simulated seepage is equally divided into 201 record nodes and a 15 cm soil column is longitudinally divided into 301 nodes so each case embraces 201 t axis 301 ht axis 60501 data points 4 4 1 volumetric water content as previously mentioned since the lower boundary condition of water flow was set as free drainage there is a sharp drop of θ near the soil column bottom in some cases included in fig 10a c results demonstrate that the greater the ρ d and the lower the η 0 the slower the water diffusion which is consistent with the law obtained from the laboratory test besides the top soil within about 1 cm depth soon reaches its saturation state shortly after the start of seepage with the increase of depth the time required for soil from initially unsaturated state to saturated state gradually prolongs that is the transition zone as marked in fig 10a widens in horizontal and the influence of ρ d is very conspicuous whereas an increase in η 0 plays the opposite role the underlying reason for above findings lies in that when seepage occurs in the upper part of soil column the pore solution concentration decreases the diffuse double layer of clay particles thickens and the existence of dispersity makes the aggregates cemented by clay particles disintegrate and then occupy more pore spaces although the clay particles get released and the volume of their overlapping water film increases the narrowing of pore channels enhances the viscosity of pore wall and the free energy of passing water decreases which weakens the conduction function of overlapping water film to a certain extent therefore the seepage slows down further the saturation speed of the soil in the lower part decreases which is manifested in the deeper the position the longer the time for soil saturation so that the soil below a specific depth in some cases is not able to achieve saturation when the simulated seepage terminates this reveals that the dispersity of dispersive soil subjected to water infiltration makes its saturation progress lag behind 4 4 2 soluble salt content fig 10d f show that soils at different depths first experience salt accumulation and then leaching and the salt accumulation rate is fast indicating that the arrival of the wetting front can cause a rapid rise of η however the leaching rate is much slower which can be identified by the distribution density of isolines it is also found that when seepage terminates the η at the soil column top is not equal to 0 and the lower the η 0 and ρ d the closer it is to 0 although the ion adsorption condition was not considered during model building such result reflects the reality that the soil will not be completely desalinized due to the selective adsorption effect of clay particles in addition the region with most obvious salt accumulation is not necessarily at the soil column bottom and the ρ d and η 0 can promote its upward and downward movement respectively this is due to the gradual enrichment of soluble salts in pore water and limited to soil permeability the amount of supplemental water from the upper part is low thus it is difficult for water to transport all salts downward within a short period meanwhile the salt solubility limits the synchronous changes of water and salt therefore the η displays a low high low distribution from the top to the bottom of soil column indicating that the entire transport of salt lags behind that of water 4 4 3 unsaturated hydraulic conductivity fig 10g i present the spatiotemporal k u distribution of soil column during simulated seepage in practice the magnitude order of k u is more concerned so the k u in the same magnitude order in the figure is marked with the same color results illustrate that the k u at a certain depth increases when seepage progressing after the start of simulated seepage the k u in a higher magnitude order lasts longer an increase in ρ d and η 0 slows down and accelerates the increase of k u respectively and both two factors can change the range of k u for example when ρ d 1 44 g cm3 and η 0 0 3 the magnitude order of k u before and after seepage is between 1e 16 and 1e 8 m s whereas it is between 1e 16 and 1e 7 m s when η 0 increases to 1 0 that is the soil permeability gets enhanced when seepage terminates note that when θ reaches its θ s the k u is equal to the saturated hydraulic conductivity k sat as given in fig 11 for all experimental cases the k sat varies within the range between 1e 8 and 3e 7 m s moreover the magnitude order of three cases is 1e 7 m s and the other five are 1e 8 m s implying the dominant magnitude order of k sat is 1e 8 m s 4 5 profile changes after seepage the representative soil column with ρ d 1 44 g cm3 and η 0 0 3 after laboratory seepage test was sampled fig 4a to explore the post seepage profile changes in particle composition and pore microstructure 4 5 1 particle composition fig 12 a shows the test results of soil particle size distribution including cumulative and incremental distribution curves each incremental distribution curve exhibits an obvious bimodal shape with peaks a and b whose corresponding particle sizes are near the boundaries of clay silt and silt sand groups respectively and the inflection particle size between the two peaks is near 10 μm the incremental percentages at two peaks change regularly along the seepage direction from p1 to p5 top to bottom fig 4a their incremental percentages at peak a increase monotonously on the whole and that of sample p1 can still be distinguished from the other four even when the particle size is as low as 0 5 μm besides the order at peak b is just opposite to that at peak a this change law reveals that the water flow in pores is able to carry fine clay particles downward thus leading to an increasing relative proportion of silt and sand in situ in soil columns which is the results of the dispersion of dispersive soil particles combined with the laboratory and simulated results it can be reasonably speculated that the increasing ρ d and η 0 may weaken and enhance such changes respectively fig 12b shows the variations of three characteristic particle sizes d 10 d 30 and d 60 corresponding to cumulative percentages of 10 30 and 60 respectively it can be seen that the three all behave a decreasing trend along the seepage direction reflecting that the proportion of fine particles is more where closer to the soil column bottom which is the result of the downward migration of fine particles dragged by water flow fig 12c presents the cc and cu along the seepage direction the cc decreases singly from p1 to p5 with values between 1 2 0 6 the cu shows a trend of first increasing p1 p2 and then decreasing p2 p5 with values 16 so these samples are poorly graded except for p1 since the natural dispersive soil for testing is also poorly graded fig 1 above result suggests that the seepage process mainly changes the homogeneity of top soil within about 3 cm this is related to the earlier saturation occurred within such a depth and subsequent continuous loss of fine particles besides the weak permeability of dispersive soil is also believed to restrict the significant change in soil homogeneity to a certain extent above phenomenon warns that even under such a low head of 2 cm the dispersive soil can still experience detectable particle loss suggesting that the critical hydraulic gradient when dispersive soil forming internal erosion may be extremely low 4 5 2 pore microstructure the mip results of three samples m1 m3 and m5 along the seepage direction are shown in fig 13 a the measured pore size ranges from 0 006 to 350 μm according to the cumulative pore volume curves the total volume of m1 0 4018 ml g is significantly higher than that of m3 0 2796 ml g and m5 0 2747 ml g and that of m3 and m5 are close proving that the seepage mainly affects the pore microstructure near the soil column top within t e the incremental pore volume curves behave bimodal characteristics as a whole the pore size ranges corresponding to the two peaks of m1 are 0 1 20 and 20 350 μm respectively the two peaks of m3 and m5 almost coincide and their ranges are 0 1 5 and 5 350 μm respectively this shows that the seepage has transformed some larger pores right peak into smaller pores left peak near m1 leading to a significant increase in the volume of smaller pores however compared with m3 and m5 the incremental volume curve of m1 moves towards the right side and the pore diameters corresponding to the two peaks increase as a whole reflecting the occurrence of structural collapse of soil skeleton due to dispersion while interacting with water so that the larger pores are filled with dispersed soil particles and then isolated into smaller pores the reason why the pore sizes corresponding to the two peaks of m1 are still higher than that of m3 and m5 is not only determined by the disintegration and downward movement of dispersive clay particles but also related to the weak expansibility of clay minerals under low overburden pressure fig 13b shows the changes of porosity and tortuosity included in mip results of three samples which perform symmetric trends the m1 has the highest porosity 51 0 and lowest tortuosity 4 7201 and the m3 and m5 have close porosity 42 3 43 0 respectively and tortuosity 6 6311 6 0196 respectively a higher tortuosity means that a longer and more curved seepage path exists between two random positions in soil hence a greater viscous resistance needs to be overcome for water flow on the contrary an increase in porosity indicates that some pores in soil are connected inducing the pore channel wider and straighter hence the randomness of water flow moving downward is reduced which is conducive to seepage it can be seen that the average pore diameter shown in fig 13c is larger near the soil column top m1 0 173 μm but there are little changes in another two parts m3 0 113 μm and m5 0 109 μm which echoes the change of porosity presented in fig 13b similarly the backbone fractal dimension shown in fig 13c is obviously different only at m1 2 444 whereas that of m3 and m5 are close 2 808 and 2 787 respectively suggesting that a longer period of seepage can simplify the skeleton of dispersive soil above changes demonstrate that fine particles in dispersive soil will migrate downward during seepage then lead to a loss of fine particles near the soil column top combined with the laboratory and simulated results it can be reasonably inferred that when ρ d and η 0 increase the affected region of soil pore microstructure might be thinner and thicker respectively 5 discussions the process and consequence when water flowing through soils have long been an interesting and important topic especially when solving seepage induced soil failure problems both experimental and analytic approaches were booming in describing the seepage characteristics of different soil types from the second half of the last century for instance klute 1965 assembled a simple apparatus for measuring soil hydraulic conductivity based on the constant head principle biswas et al 1966 analyzed the basic processes of water redistribution of agricultural soils experimentally warrick et al 1971 presented numerical equations for describing the displacement of solutes during infiltration with calibration of experiment data gumbs and warkentin 1972 found a small increase in bulk density of soil column markedly slowed down the inside water movement under a 1 5 cm constant water head seepage regime van den berg 1989 successfully obtained the hydraulic conductivity of silt loam soil columns by employing the infiltration method with a mariotte bottle which was used for creating a 1 3 cm constant head and the methodology of the current study was like theirs in particular the implementation of soil column tests has helped solve soil hydro physical problems chen et al 2021 dikinya et al 2008 mohammadzadeh habili and heidarpour 2015 yang et al 2004 moreover since the hydrus series codes were released many complex progresses including water flow and solute transport have been better understood in unsaturated soils inoue et al 2000 ma et al 2010 shaygan et al 2018 the combined applications of physical tests and numerical simulations gradually became a mature methodology in dealing with the soil water salt interaction processes however the coverage of soil types especially the water sensitive soils that are easy to induce serious engineering problems is not comprehensive and the experimental verification of soil changes at the micro level is insufficient either let alone consider the plus of important soil variables dispersive soil as a water sensitive special soil has greatly threatened the stability of earthen engineering structures in the current study area han et al 2022a and the failure it caused is inseparable from its seepage process which indirectly determines the spatial scale of hydro failure this has become the primary motivation for conducting this study dispersive soils have been found inseparable from plenty of hydro failures of earthen structures worldwide which attracts researchers to examine the function of different additions on inhibiting soil dispersion in previous studies consoli nilo et al 2021 vakili et al 2018a 2021 but how water and soluble salt transport in it during infiltration have been overlooked the refined characterization of the dynamic seepage process as well as its consequence in dispersive soil is the prominent feature of this study and the impacts of two common but important factors were evaluated the seepage characteristics of dispersive soil with analyses of the spatiotemporal variation law and underlying mechanism can promote a more in depth understanding of the soil water interaction process of dispersive soil and further provide new insights for the targeted prevention and control of dispersive soil catastrophes furthermore for the building and experimental verification of complex multi physical field coupling models the results of this study may also be used as positive references it is well known that the measurement of permeation parameters of soils is very sensitive to methodology hence this study has initially tried to ensure the quality of the results presented from the following five aspects 1 careful preparation of dispersive soil soluble salt water mixtures 2 careful compaction of dispersive soil columns 3 stable water supply equipment to maintain a constant head during seepage 4 reasonable selection of boundary conditions for hydrus 1d simulation 5 well accepted instruments for analyzing soil particle and pore distributions yet it should be appreciated that the results presented in this study were obtained by applying a 2 cm water head on the 15 cm dispersive soil columns by comparison the height of the soil column seems insufficient therefore the pressure effect of the ponding water on the soil column top as well as the size effect might impact the results however according to the mohr coulomb criteria the cohesion of soil is equal to its shear strength when no external stress is applied since the cohesion of lean clay with sand at a relatively dry state is usually at a level of at least several tens of kpa especially when the soil ω 0 is below the plastic limit ω 0 11 18 2 in this study the head pressure of 0 2 kpa on the soil column top due to the 2 cm layer of water was almost negligible to the modification of soil structure and did not cause any additional impact on pressure other than supporting uninterrupted infiltration generally speaking under the constant head seepage condition the head height mainly affects the duration of water flowing through a soil column at a given height below the critical water head that can induce piping in dispersive soil a higher water head will accelerate the water flow additionally the length of soil column affects the time required for water to flow out from its bottom when the height of soil column is fully extended and the 2 cm water head becomes insignificant such change mainly prolongs the t e and the relativity of seepage law between different η 0 and ρ d will not change significantly despite this how the scale effect between water head and soil column size influences the seepage characteristics is worth further exploration the follow up related research is expected to better meet the understanding of the seepage characteristics of dispersive soil under different engineering and hydraulic boundary conditions 6 conclusions this study explored the seepage characteristics in unsaturated dispersive soil columns by combining the laboratory constant head seepage test and hydrus 1d simulation effects of three levels of initial soil soluble salt content η 0 0 3 1 0 and 2 0 and dry density ρ d 1 44 1 53 and 1 62 g cm3 were considered emphases were paid on the redistributions of water salt and permeability of dispersive soil the seepage induced particle composition and pore microstructure changes were analyzed based on a representative soil column the predominant conclusions are summarized as follows 1 under a constant head the wetting front moves fast first and then slow in unsaturated dispersive soil there exhibits a power relationship between the moving distance and the elapsed seepage time 2 soluble salt plays a harmful role when η 0 increases an increase of its increment can accelerate the seepage process in current test the η 0 increasing from 0 3 to 1 0 and from 1 0 to 2 0 lead to 19 2 32 4 and at least 37 1 of reductions in the total seepage duration respectively by contrast the impact of ρ d is weaker and opposite to that of η 0 overall 3 the arrival of the wetting front can cause a surge in volumetric water content θ and a rapid increase in soluble salt content η an increase in ρ d significantly delays the salt leaching process the η reaches its maximum ahead of θ at the end of seepage the region with the most severe salt accumulation does not necessarily appear at the soil column bottom 4 within the scope of this study the magnitude order of hydraulic conductivity ranges between 1e 16 to 1e 7 m s when the dispersive soil evolves from initially unsaturated to saturated states mainly 1e 8 m s an increase in ρ d and η 0 weakens and enhances the permeability of dispersive soil respectively 5 even if under a low water head seepage is able to promote the downward migration of fine particles due to the existence of soil dispersity so as to simplify the pore microstructure near the soil column top reflecting that the unstable skeleton of dispersive soil makes the seepage features unsteady evolution this also suggests that the threshold hydraulic gradient corresponding to the formation of internal erosion in dispersive soil can be quite low 6 inspired by the obtained findings in dispersive soil adopting the technology of preventing the upward migration of soluble salt underground and improving the compaction degree can both effectively prevent the occurrence of erosion problems such as piping credit authorship contribution statement yan han writing original draft methodology

the amount and quality of doc not only impacts the water quality but also affects biological and chemical reactions occurring in the river and lake system blaurock et al 2021 in headwater catchments stream doc mainly originates from terrestrial sources whereby doc migration results from complex interactions between microbial and physicochemical processes fork et al 2020 saiers et al 2021 changes in nutrient availability redox conditions groundwater levels land cover decomposer activity and climate are important control factors of doc production and impact its transfer from terrestrial sources to stream rivers bahureksa et al 2022 greed et al 2008 paumelle et al 2021 richardson et al 2011 sanwlani et al 2022 assessing and constructing numerical simulation models for doc concentrations are of great importance for the security of ecosystems the dynamic patterns of doc concentrations vary between the dryness and wetness periods dong et al 2021 saiers et al 2021 for example doc concentrations are relatively low during the dry season compared to the wet season blaurock et al 2021 this is because the release of doc from terrestrial ecological systems is inhibited due to lower precipitation and runoff in the dry season compared to the rewetting period the majority of studies e g blaurock et al 2021 ritson et al 2017 negassa et al 2021 typically focus on the following three topics i the dynamic patterns of doc during drought or rewetting periods ii the driving mechanisms of fluvial doc dynamic patterns and iii the variations in the discharge concentration relationship during dryness wetness periods for a single timescale e g at the seasonal or annual scale rather than multiple timescales however dryness wetness periods have multiple timescales for example the commonly used dryness wetness index namely the standardized streamflow index ssi vicente serrano et al 2011 can be characterized to the different timescale features of hydrological processes based on the moving window used the different ssi timescales represent the varying dryness wetness features for example duration and severity which are two key characteristics of the dryness wetness periods brunner et al 2021 wu et al 2019a 2019b previous research has not yet determined the possible variations between the dynamic doc patterns under distinct dryness wetness timescales similarly doc concentration simulations based on the dryness wetness duration and severity remain to be further explored thus the current study focuses on filling in these gaps the responses of stream water doc concentration vary in different catchments during dryness and subsequent rewetting periods clark et al 2006 dong et al 2021 several studies have suggested that decreasing doc concentrations during droughts were attributed to disconnected hydrological flow paths which resulted in the inefficient transport of carbon to the stream water blaurock et al 2021 doc concentrations exhibit a strong linear relationship with hydrological drought duration namely doc concentrations increase with drought duration wu et al 2022 other studies have reported high doc concentration peaks as a consequence of accumulated doc in shallow ground the soil zone and the land surface flushed from terrestrial sources to river streams with rewetting following a drought inamdar et al 2004 tunaley et al 2016 however a depletion of the doc supply is observed prior to the peak flow by the flushing of a finite source of leachable doc hirst et al 2021 the doc is also transferred from enriched streams during the rising hydrograph to less concentrated streams during the falling hydrograph stewart et al 2022 thus the spatial dynamic migration mechanisms of doc may vary with the timescale in the hydrograph process by combining partial least squares regression with multiple linear regression humbert et al 2015 revealed that the dry season characteristics i e length and drawdown determine the annual doc concentrations while annual runoff determines the annual doc load the proportion of major landscape elements e g wetland and forested land also affects the doc dynamics during the different hydrograph stages ulloa cedamanos et al 2022 for example in typical boreal catchments covered by 10 20 wetlands doc originates primarily from wetland sources during low flow conditions and from forested areas during high flows laudon et al 2011 controls on decadal annual and seasonal concentration discharge c q relationships in the sleepers river catchment vermont northeastern united states have been observed to vary whereby the annual c q relationship is strong and c q patterns are distinct among seasons due to the different hydrological processes poter et al 2022 furthermore heterogeneity in land cover or wetland causes spatial variability in stream water doc concentrations ritson et al 2017 while much of the temporal dynamics are typically associated with hydrometeorological conditions ritson et al 2014 lumped or distributed ecohydrology catchment models may simulate doc concentrations dusek et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 however due to the complex model structure and large number of parameters the simulated results are unidentifiable and uncertain as they are based on too few empirical measurements to allow an accurate statistical estimation of the parameter values lan et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 in addition the physically based mode requires models to accurately simulate different flow phases particularly in extreme flows high and low flows saiers et al 2021 which is difficult to achieve de vos et al 2010 zhang et al 2015 although simple statistical regression models lack a direct expression of physical mechanisms they may still be able to achieve a reasonable approximation of the response relationship between doc dynamics and the characteristics of hydrological extremes using a sufficient level of hydro chemical data ni et al 2020 wu et al 2022 for example river flow and doc concentrations can be adopted to construct mathematical models for the simulation or prediction of doc concentrations keller et al 2008 wu et al 2022 employed the autoregressive integrated moving average model to construct the response relationship of doc concentrations for hydrological drought duration and severity the authors demonstrated the ability of the multi variate regression model to simulate doc concentrations during a hydrological drought despite the progress made by the aforementioned studies they failed to consider the different dryness wetness characteristics under multiple timescales in this study we investigate the potential differences in the dynamic patterns of doc concentrations across dryness wetness timescales furthermore we simulate doc concentrations during dryness wetness events based on duration and severity features using statistical models these models are applied to several basins while keeping the model structure unchanged the specific objectives of this study are to i explore the doc concentration patterns during dryness wetness events while considering multiple timescales features ii construct simulation models of doc concentrations based on dryness wetness characteristics and iii provide a framework for the construction validation and application of the model the approach adopted in the study can be applied more broadly to simulate doc concentrations of other basins the results help to understand the importance in considering the different timescales of dryness wetness conditions when predicting event scale doc concentration behavior 2 study case and monitoring data harp lake catchment has an area of 542 ha and is located in south central ontario canada fig 1 such cold region forested ecosystems act as sinks or sources of carbon morison et al 2022 making them an important part of the climate change feedback loop ledesma et al 2018 the harp lake catchment is adjacent to the great lakes and drains into lake huron the second largest of the great lakes thus the harp lake catchment is useful in revealing variations in doc concentration as it represents headwaters related to ecological health and is also sensitive to climate change approximately one third of annual rainfall falls as snow in winter with the majority of rain falling in autumn accounting for 30 of the annual rainfall moreover 50 of the annual runoff comes from spring snowmelt march to may fu and yao 2015 hp3a hp4 and hp6 are three drainage basins in the catchment with control areas of 19 6 ha 122 8 ha and 9 28 ha respectively the water quantity and quality at these catchments was monitored from june 1976 to december 2019 daily streamflow and weekly sometimes biweekly doc concentrations were collected for these sites the data is monitored by the inland waters unit environmental monitoring and reporting branch ontario ministry of environment conservation and parks canada all datasets have undergone strict quality control and have been used in previous studies e g wu et al 2022 morison et al 2022 yao et al 2014 detailed information on geological soil and climatic conditions as well as vegetation can be found in previous reports yao et al 2009 yao et al 2011 james et al 2022 3 methods fig 2 depicts the proposed framework which includes four key components i the daily streamflow was processed into monthly sequences to calculate the standardized streamflow index ssi of different timescales the monthly streamflow was used as this index requires at a least monthly scale vicente serrano et al 2011 ii the ssi was calculated under 1 3 and 12 month timescales representing monthly seasonal and annual timescales respectively monthly mean doc concentrations corresponding to different timescales were obtained using the average moving window method on a weekly dataset iii the dryness wetness characteristics and corresponding to the doc concentrations were extracted run theory yevjevich 1967 and the dryness wetness threshold were used to extract the dryness wetness characteristics that is the duration and severity duration d months denotes the start tstart to end tend time of a specific dryness wetness event severity s dimensionless is defined as the sum of the threshold minus the dryness wetness index during the duration that is 1 s dryness w e t n e s s t start t end t h r e s h o l d s s i i where tstart and tend represent the start and end time of dryness wetness events respectively threshold is the dryness wetness threshold that is 0 5 for dryness and 0 5 for wetness and i is a certain time point between tstart and tend the doc concentrations during the dryness wetness events were then extracted using the following equation 2 doc c o n c e n t r a t i o n s t start t end d o c i where doc i is the doc value at time i during a certain dryness wetness duration iv the response relationship model of the doc concentrations to the dryness wetness characteristics under multiple timescales was constructed validated and tested for the model construction and validation we first analyzed the two dimensional relationship between key variables i e relationship between d and s d s d and doc d doc and s and doc s doc and subsequently constructed the three dimensional response relationship models i e relationship among d s and doc that is d s doc using the data from basin hp3a the cross validation method was used for the construction and validation processes and three evaluation indicators namely the coefficient of determination r 2 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and the mean absolute percentage error mape were used to determine the goodness of fit of the model performance the optimal model was selected and further applied to basins hp4 and hp6 this demonstrates the ability of the proposed framework to adopt various basin datasets to construct and validate simulations models and to further apply these models to other basins 3 1 standardized streamflow index ssi the ssi was used to describe the dryness wetness from a hydrological perspective under multiple timescales vicente serrano et al 2011 different timescales of ssi reflect the different dryness wetness conditions for example short timescales e g 1 and 3 months can effectively characterize the variation of short term dryness wetness conditions while ling timescales e g 12 and 24 months describe the long term dryness wetness conditions wu et al 2018 as the different ssi timescales represent different cumulative streamflow anomalies of consecutive months they can reflect the different timescales of hydrological processes vicente serrano et al 2011 for example the 3 month ssi in may is calculated based on the cumulative streamflow from march to may the ssi timescales of 1 3 and 12 months are commonly used to represent dryness wetness variations at the monthly seasonal and annual scale respectively wu et al 2018 the streamflow probability distribution functions were determined and subsequently used to calculate ssi after normal standardization shukla and wood 2008 reported the better applicability of the log normal distribution function for streamflow at different timescales compared to other probability distribution functions detailed calculation procedures of ssi are presented in previous studies vicente serrano et al 2011 wu et al 2016 table 1 reports the ssi classifications of the dryness wetness events based on the classification of ssi the thresholds 0 5 and 0 5 were adopted to identify the dryness and wetness events and their duration and severity respectively ssi values between 0 5 and 0 5 indicate a normal streamflow values larger than 0 5 denote wet conditions and values lower than 0 5 indicate dry conditions 3 2 construction and validation of simulation models the simulation models for doc concentrations based on dryness wetness duration and severity were constructed as a multivariable linear regression model mlrm for basin hp3a first we analyzed the two dimensional relationship between the dryness wetness characteristics and the corresponding doc concentrations that is d s d doc and s doc to obtain the change patterns of these variables and to determine the main influencing variable for the doc concentration patterns the three dimensional relationships i e d s doc among these variables were then examined the general equation for the mlrm is 3 y β 0 β 1 x 1 a β 2 x 2 a β k x ka ε a where β 0 β 1 β 2 β k represent the regression coefficients x1a xka are independent variables for a given site a and ε a is the error term since there are only two independent variables i e d and s in this study the equation 3 is written as 4 y β 0 β 1 x 1 β 2 x 2 where y x 1 and x 2 represent the doc concentration d and s respectively at hp3a the constructed models were used to simulate the doc concentrations during the dryness and wetness events based on the dryness and wetness characteristics i e d and s under multiple timescales each timescale had its own set of regression coefficient numbers the cross validation method was employed to construct the mlrm more specifically the dryness wetness event samples were divided into different groups and each group was further separated into training and test groups for the construction and validation of the simulation model based on the cross validation principle 2 3 of the samples were set as the training set for the model construction and the remaining 1 3 samples were taken as the test set wu et al 2018 three indicators namely r 2 nse and mape equations 5 7 respectively were employed to evaluate the goodness of fit performance of the simulation models in the test set the model with the best simulation results was chosen to represent the optimal model and was applied to other basins 5 r 2 i 1 n o i o i 1 n s i s i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n s i s 2 6 nse 1 i 1 n o i s i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 7 mape 1 n i 1 n o i s i o i 2 where o and s represent the observed and simulated doc concentrations based on the constructed models under a specific timescale i e monthly seasonal or annual the closer the r 2 and nse values mape are to 1 0 the better the simulated values 3 3 application of the simulation model the optimal mape model for the response of doc concentrations to dryness wetness characteristics was applied to simulate doc concentrations during dryness wetness events at the other two monitored sites hp4 and hp6 simulating the doc concentrations of other sites using the same model and regression parameters coefficients obtained from hp3a will output simulation results with varying magnitudes due to the differences in the basin attributes even under the same climate conditions thus the simulated results were corrected teutschbein and seibert 2012 assuming that y represents the simulated values obtained from the optimal simulation model and x represents the observed values we can construct a relationship between x and y to correct the simulated values as 8 x y b k where k and b represent the correction coefficients 4 results and discussion 4 1 variation of dryness wetness and doc patterns under different timescales the fluctuation magnitudes of ssi varied with the timescale during the 41 year study period fig 3 the 1 and 3 month ssi exhibited large fluctuations while the 12 month ssi was relatively more stable several dryness or wetness events identified by the short timescale ssi were included in the longer duration dryness or wetness events identified by the long timescale ssi the 12 month ssi reveals the trends of the harp lake catchment to have shifted between wet and dry during the study period with the fluctuations dry trend wet trend dry trend wet trend dry trend wet trend during 1978 1982 1983 1985 1986 1987 1988 1995 1996 1999 and 2000 2019 respectively the dry trend denotes a change towards drying while the wet trend indicates a change towards wetting the variations in doc concentrations exhibited a similar pattern generally shifting between decreasing and increasing trends over the four decades in addition low doc values corresponded to low ssi values particularly for the 12 month timescale table 2 summarizes the statistical characteristics of the dryness and wetness events and their corresponding doc concentrations based on the results of fig 3 the number of dryness wetness events decreased with the increasing timescale while the opposite was true for the average duration and severity the maximum duration and severity for dryness wetness events also increased with the ssi timescale based on the three ssi timescales the minimum dryness wetness duration is 1 month while the minimum severity is close to the dryness wetness threshold moreover the mean and minimum doc concentrations during the dryness events increased with the dryness wetness index timescale while the wetness events decreased the maximum doc concentrations during both the dryness and wetness events decreased with the dryness wetness timescale as the sliding window increased based on the method of dryness wetness index the average maximum and minimum doc concentrations during the wetness events exceeded those of the dryness events under each timescale 4 2 simulation models for doc based on dryness wetness characteristics 4 2 1 two and three dimensional relationships fig 4 depicts the two dimensional relationships for the d s d doc and s doc models which passed the significance test p 0 00 at the hp3a site the dryness wetness severity increased with the dryness wetness event duration in addition the doc concentrations during the dryness wetness events increased with the duration and severity of the dryness wetness events the majority of dryness wetness event samples were located in the 95 prediction range of the linear models the 95 prediction range for d doc was smaller or narrower than that of s doc indicating that the importance of dryness wetness duration for the cumulative effect of doc concentration was larger than that of severity the import export of doc in the basin depended more on the length of the dryness wetness duration rather than the magnitude the longer the dryness wetness duration the higher the doc concentrations longer rains for example can wash out more terrestrial chemicals into rivers while rainfall intensity may play a secondary role in these processes murphy et al 2015 the three dimensional relationships among d s doc during the dryness wetness events were also strong fig 5 that is doc concentrations increased with d and s 4 2 2 construction and validation of simulation models according to the cross validation principles the dryness wetness event samples were divided into three groups for each ssi timescale at the hp3 site for example there were 65 dryness event samples for the 1 month scale table 2 for hp3 site these 65 dryness events were initially sorted into chronological order i e from 1 to 65 the upper 2 3 samples from 1 to 43 middle 2 3 from 12 to 54 and lower 2 3 from 45 65 and 1 11 i e 43 samples in each group were set as the training groups and the remaining 1 3 samples i e 22 samples were taken as the test groups this cross validation was also applied to the remaining two timescales thus we constructed three models with the same structure but varying parameters for each dryness wetness timescale the optimal model was then selected based on the evaluation indicators table 3 reports the statistics of the evaluation indicators for each simulation model under different timescales from the evaluation indicators for the dryness events the goodness of fit performance of the simulation models in group 3 of the 1 month timescale group 1 of the 3 month timescale and group 3 of the 12 month timescale are better than the other groups in the same timescale for the wetness events the evaluation indicators of group 1 of the 1 month timescale group 1 of the 3 month timescale and group 2 of the 12 month timescale indicate a better performance than the other group models based on this the best performing models were selected as the optimal models to simulate the doc concentrations during the dryness wetness events in the corresponding timescales table 4 lists the optimal doc concentration simulation models based on the dryness wetness characteristics under different timescales at the hp3a site the variations in the simulated and observed doc concentrations exhibited a similar trend in each timescale for the test events fig 6 the doc concentrations during the dryness wetness events can be simulated well with the calibrated models 4 2 3 application of the simulation models hp4 and hp6 the optimal simulation model of the doc concentrations constructed based on the hp3a dataset was applied to monitoring sites hp4 and hp6 we compared the simulated results corrected and uncorrected and observed values fig 7 the corrected equations for the simulated doc concentrations at hp4 and hp6 are reported in table s1 and table s2 respectively although both the uncorrected and corrected simulated doc concentrations in different timescales exhibited a good relationship with the observed values the corrected values were closer to the 1 1 line and better than the uncorrected values which had obvious underestimating bias all the evaluation indicators indicated a good performance for the corrected values table 5 the optimal simulation models combined with the proposed correction method can be applied to simulate doc concentrations during dryness wetness events for study catchments 4 3 discussion 4 3 1 simulation models of doc concentrations in dryness wetness periods in this study we constructed the simulation models of doc concentration responses to dryness wetness characteristics under multiple timescales the commonly used ssi was used to describe the dryness wetness at the monthly seasonal and annual scales the models exhibited a good performance in simulating doc concentrations during dryness wetness events under different timescales by considering the correction coefficients of the simulation models the optimal models from one basin could be applied to other nearby basins previous research has constructed response relationship models of doc concentrations to hydrological drought i e streamflow deficits characteristics wu et al 2022 however they did not simultaneously consider both dryness and wetness characteristics and failed to account for the multiple timescales of hydrological processes the current study improved on these limitations the continuous daily process of doc can be simulated by constructing a physically process based basin model such as the semi distributed model swat zhang et al 2020 the lumped model hbv shih et al 2019 or the regional hydro ecological simulation system rouhani et al 2021 however such models with a complex structure and extensive parameters need to be calibrated which proves to be a difficult task in addition even when calibrated these models cannot guarantee the simulation accuracy of different phase flow processes vrugt et al 2005 relatively simple statistical regression models can simulate doc concentrations by considering hydrochemistry factors closely related to doc concentrations if the long term measurements are available this has been confirmed in previous studies in the boreal shield lakes canada keller et al 2008 harp lake catchment canada wu et al 2022 and the upper yangtze river china ni et al 2020 as well as in the present case study this is because the observed streamflow and doc concentrations contain key information driven by controlling physical mechanisms and hydrological characteristics such as event duration and severity have a strong influence on the formulation of doc concentrations the proposed framework has the following four advantages i the standardized dryness wetness index was used in the framework which facilitates the modelling of other catchments when the correction coefficients are considered ii multiple dryness wetness timescales were considered helping to understand the dynamic patterns of doc concentration responses to different hydrological processes and stages iii the cross validation method was employed in the model construction and validation process which can minimize the uncertainty of the model results and iv most importantly the proposed framework may be applied to other basins in different regions if the data is available using the same model structure but different parameters to construct the simulation models of other catchments is also feasible if there are sufficient measurements i e biondi and de luca 2015 wu et al 2022 however we employed the correction coefficient method in this study as it is able to deal with insufficient lacking data of other basins although the correction coefficient method needs to be calibrated to the measured data it is able to demonstrate the usefulness of the constructed models in particular it highlights the process of simulating doc concentrations in a data free catchment 4 3 2 variation of doc concentrations and dryness wetness patterns the variation of dryness wetness in the harp lake catchment generally exhibits six phases of changing trends namely dry wet dry wet dry wet during 1978 1982 1983 1985 1986 1987 1988 1995 1996 1999 and 2000 2019 these variation patterns with streamflow should be addressed in the doc calculations and assessments in terms of long term changes following 2000 a wetting trend was generally observed for the 1 year ssi the annual streamflow increased slightly without a significant trend in the past four decades nalley et al 2016 wu et al 2022 yao et al 2011 previous studies argue that the annual streamflow will increase by 12 in the future compared to that over the base period from 1961 to 1990 in the detroit river southern ontario due to global warming rahman et al 2012 we also observed large variations in the average doc concentrations during the dryness and wetness periods more specifically average doc concentrations during dryness events were lower than those of the wetness events this agrees with previous studies e g blaurock et al 2021 dong et al 2021 ritson et al 2017 the release of doc from terrestrial ecological systems is inhibited or restricted during periods of low precipitation and runoff but subsequently increases in the rewetting period blaurock et al 2021 dalzell et al 2005 majidzadeh et al 2017 although it will take some time for the doc export import response to be activated following variations in the streamflow process average doc concentrations are generally low high during the dryness wetness periods the average duration and severity of dryness wetness increased with the ssi timescales this can be attributed to the moving window method used to calculate the ssi process leading to a short duration dryness wetness event extracted by the short term ssi being included in a long duration dryness wetness event identified by the long term ssi wu et al 2018 the average annual doc concentrations at sites hp3a hp4 and hp6 increased significantly by 0 10 mg l p 0 02 0 34 mg l p 0 00 and 0 69 mg l p 0 00 per 10 years during the study period fig s1 respectively this supports the doc concentration increase under the 12 month moving average scenario fig 3 d e f in our previous studies we attributed the increases in doc concentrations in the harp lake catchment to decreases in so4 due to changes in temperature and ph wu et al 2022 in fact doc concentrations have increased in rivers throughout the world clark et al 2006 morison et al 2022 worral and burt 2008 with most reported changes occurring in catchments that may experience increased temperature and decreases in ionic strength and soil solution acidity fenner et al 2021 hruska et al 2009 monteith et al 2007 moreover changes in land use and biogeochemical boundary conditions have also enhanced doc concentrations in surface waters and altered water quality ahearn et al 2005 cookson et al 2007 dhillon and inamdar 2013 the simulation performance in hp6 site was weaker than that in hp4 table 5 we suspected that the performance differences between the sites were related to the two households upstream of site hp6 whose domestic sewage may have interfered with the natural doc concentration dynamics for example hp6 exhibits higher average doc concentrations but has smaller catchment than hp4 the routine management of doc concentrations during dryness wetness events can therefore help to comply with water quality directives and reduce the costs of drinking water purification however knowledge on how doc changes and moves within and across terrestrial aquatic interfaces is still limited and in particular its link to carbon cycles at the event scale remains unclear this is beyond the scope of this study and will be explored in future work 4 3 3 limitations and further work the framework proposed in the current study provides a newer perspective to improve our understanding on the dynamic patterns of doc concentrations during dryness wetness events however it also has several limitations first we did not consider the impacts of different return periods of dryness wetness events on the dynamic patterns of doc concentrations for example the driving mechanism of extreme hydrometeorological events on the doc export import from land to rivers is extremely complex under different spatial and temporal conditions for the same event or different return period at the event scale clark et al 2006 monteith et al 2007 worral and burt 2008 further analysis on the influence mechanism on doc dynamic patterns can help us to better understand the variations of doc patterns under changing environments second although the ssi is commonly used as a dryness wetness index from the hydrological perspective it is associated with several bottlenecks for example it is sensitive to the quantity and reliability of data used to fit the distribution functions vicente serrano et al 2011 and assumes that all dry and wet levels have the same occurrence probability in different months wu et al 2018 shukla wood 2008 however ssi still remains the most widely used dryness wetness index further research is required to improve the index or to propose a new index third our methods simulated doc concentrations over a dryness or wetness event that is several months long providing the cumulative doc over an event however they do not provide daily doc results or details within an event this is reserved for future research 5 conclusions the present study is among the first to assess the doc dynamic patterns during different timescales of dryness wetness events an integrated framework for the construction validation and application of statistical simulation models from multiple timescales is proposed the key conclusions are summarized as follows i doc dynamic patterns vary between the dryness and wetness periods in which the dryness period exhibits lower average doc concentrations compared to the wetness period for the monthly seasonal and annual scales the average maximum and minimum doc concentrations during the dryness events increased with the dryness wetness index timescales but decreased during the wetness events ii a clear and strong three dimensional relationship for d s doc during dryness wetness events is observed and doc concentrations increase with d and s the importance of the dryness wetness duration is larger than that of severity iii based on the corresponding dryness wetness characteristics the doc concentration simulation models for the dryness wetness periods can accurately simulate the doc concentrations in the harp lake catchment the optimal models can be directly applied to other basins with similar climate and basin features when the correction coefficients are considered iv although there are still many challenges in the simulation of doc concentrations during extreme hydrometeorological events the results of this study indicate the potential in simulating doc concentrations during the dryness wetness periods credit

2831,understanding and simulating dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations is a challenge with important implications for water quality projections and carbon balance estimates particularly at the event scale hydrological dryness wetness represents water shortage surplus in surface water previous studies have analyzed the dynamic patterns of doc concentrations during either dryness or wetness or rewetting periods however the dynamic patterns of doc concentrations and corresponding simulations during both dryness and wetness events based on their characteristics i e duration and severity remain to be fully understood particularly under multiple timescales this study proposed a framework to help overcome this limitation the standardized streamflow index ssi combined with run theory was used to describe the dryness wetness characteristics at the monthly seasonal and annual scales simulation models were constructed and validated based on the multivariable linear regression model and cross validation method three evaluation indicators namely the coefficient of determination r 2 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and mean absolute percentage error mape were employed to determine the optimal model this model was then applied to additional basins based on the correction coefficient method three nearby basins hp3a hp4 and hp6 with different catchment areas 9 28 to 122 80 ha and long term 41 years daily streamflow and weekly or biweekly doc measurements in the harp lake catchment south central ontario canada were used to demonstrate the usefulness of the framework data from hp3a was used to construct and validate the simulation model and the model was applied to the hp4 and hp6 basins results show that the average doc concentration during the dryness events is lower than that in the wetness events at the monthly seasonal and annual scales the average maximum and minimum doc concentrations during the dryness events increased with the dryness wetness index timescales but decreased during the wetness events the optimal model was able to accurately simulate the doc concentrations r 2 0 90 nse 0 90 and mape 10 at the monthly seasonal and annual scales based on the hydrological characteristics during the dryness and wetness periods respectively and the application results exhibit a good performance the proposed framework can help improve the forecasting of doc

precipitation and runoff in the dry season compared to the rewetting period the majority of studies e g blaurock et al 2021 ritson et al 2017 negassa et al 2021 typically focus on the following three topics i the dynamic patterns of doc during drought or rewetting periods ii the driving mechanisms of fluvial doc dynamic patterns and iii the variations in the discharge concentration relationship during dryness wetness periods for a single timescale e g at the seasonal or annual scale rather than multiple timescales however dryness wetness periods have multiple timescales for example the commonly used dryness wetness index namely the standardized streamflow index ssi vicente serrano et al 2011 can be characterized to the different timescale features of hydrological processes based on the moving window used the different ssi timescales represent the varying dryness wetness features for example duration and severity which are two key characteristics of the dryness wetness periods brunner et al 2021 wu et al 2019a 2019b previous research has not yet determined the possible variations between the dynamic doc patterns under distinct dryness wetness timescales similarly doc concentration simulations based on the dryness wetness duration and severity remain to be further explored thus the current study focuses on filling in these gaps the responses of stream water doc concentration vary in different catchments during dryness and subsequent rewetting periods clark et al 2006 dong et al 2021 several studies have suggested that decreasing doc concentrations during droughts were attributed to disconnected hydrological flow paths which resulted in the inefficient transport of carbon to the stream water blaurock et al 2021 doc concentrations exhibit a strong linear relationship with hydrological drought duration namely doc concentrations increase with drought duration wu et al 2022 other studies have reported high doc concentration peaks as a consequence of accumulated doc in shallow ground the soil zone and the land surface flushed from terrestrial sources to river streams with rewetting following a drought inamdar et al 2004 tunaley et al 2016 however a depletion of the doc supply is observed prior to the peak flow by the flushing of a finite source of leachable doc hirst et al 2021 the doc is also transferred from enriched streams during the rising hydrograph to less concentrated streams during the falling hydrograph stewart et al 2022 thus the spatial dynamic migration mechanisms of doc may vary with the timescale in the hydrograph process by combining partial least squares regression with multiple linear regression humbert et al 2015 revealed that the dry season characteristics i e length and drawdown determine the annual doc concentrations while annual runoff determines the annual doc load the proportion of major landscape elements e g wetland and forested land also affects the doc dynamics during the different hydrograph stages ulloa cedamanos et al 2022 for example in typical boreal catchments covered by 10 20 wetlands doc originates primarily from wetland sources during low flow conditions and from forested areas during high flows laudon et al 2011 controls on decadal annual and seasonal concentration discharge c q relationships in the sleepers river catchment vermont northeastern united states have been observed to vary whereby the annual c q relationship is strong and c q patterns are distinct among seasons due to the different hydrological processes poter et al 2022 furthermore heterogeneity in land cover or wetland causes spatial variability in stream water doc concentrations ritson et al 2017 while much of the temporal dynamics are typically associated with hydrometeorological conditions ritson et al 2014 lumped or distributed ecohydrology catchment models may simulate doc concentrations dusek et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 however due to the complex model structure and large number of parameters the simulated results are unidentifiable and uncertain as they are based on too few empirical measurements to allow an accurate statistical estimation of the parameter values lan et al 2018 zhang et al 2020 in addition the physically based mode requires models to accurately simulate different flow phases particularly in extreme flows high and low flows saiers et al 2021 which is difficult to achieve de vos et al 2010 zhang et al 2015 although simple statistical regression models lack a direct expression of physical mechanisms they may still be able to achieve a reasonable approximation of the response relationship between doc dynamics and the characteristics of hydrological extremes using a sufficient level of hydro chemical data ni et al 2020 wu et al 2022 for example river flow and doc concentrations can be adopted to construct mathematical models for the simulation or prediction of doc concentrations keller et al 2008 wu et al 2022 employed the autoregressive integrated moving average model to construct the response relationship of doc concentrations for hydrological drought duration and severity the authors demonstrated the ability of the multi variate regression model to simulate doc concentrations during a hydrological drought despite the progress made by the aforementioned studies they failed to consider the different dryness wetness characteristics under multiple timescales in this study we investigate the potential differences in the dynamic patterns of doc concentrations across dryness wetness timescales furthermore we simulate doc concentrations during dryness wetness events based on duration and severity features using statistical models these models are applied to several basins while keeping the model structure unchanged the specific objectives of this study are to i explore the doc concentration patterns during dryness wetness events while considering multiple timescales features ii construct simulation models of doc concentrations based on dryness wetness characteristics and iii provide a framework for the construction validation and application of the model the approach adopted in the study can be applied more broadly to simulate doc concentrations of other basins the results help to understand the importance in considering the different timescales of dryness wetness conditions when predicting event scale doc concentration behavior 2 study case and monitoring data harp lake catchment has an area of 542 ha and is located in south central ontario canada fig 1 such cold region forested ecosystems act as sinks or sources of carbon morison et al 2022 making them an important part of the climate change feedback loop ledesma et al 2018 the harp lake catchment is adjacent to the great lakes and drains into lake huron the second largest of the great lakes thus the harp lake catchment is useful in revealing variations in doc concentration as it represents headwaters related to ecological health and is also sensitive to climate change approximately one third of annual rainfall falls as snow in winter with the majority of rain falling in autumn accounting for 30 of the annual rainfall moreover 50 of the annual runoff comes from spring snowmelt march to may fu and yao 2015 hp3a hp4 and hp6 are three drainage basins in the catchment with control areas of 19 6 ha 122 8 ha and 9 28 ha respectively the water quantity and quality at these catchments was monitored from june 1976 to december 2019 daily streamflow and weekly sometimes biweekly doc concentrations were collected for these sites the data is monitored by the inland waters unit environmental monitoring and reporting branch ontario ministry of environment conservation and parks canada all datasets have undergone strict quality control and have been used in previous studies e g wu et al 2022 morison et al 2022 yao et al 2014 detailed information on geological soil and climatic conditions as well as vegetation can be found in previous reports yao et al 2009 yao et al 2011 james et al 2022 3 methods fig 2 depicts the proposed framework which includes four key components i the daily streamflow was processed into monthly sequences to calculate the standardized streamflow index ssi of different timescales the monthly streamflow was used as this index requires at a least monthly scale vicente serrano et al 2011 ii the ssi was calculated under 1 3 and 12 month timescales representing monthly seasonal and annual timescales respectively monthly mean doc concentrations corresponding to different timescales were obtained using the average moving window method on a weekly dataset iii the dryness wetness characteristics and corresponding to the doc concentrations were extracted run theory yevjevich 1967 and the dryness wetness threshold were used to extract the dryness wetness characteristics that is the duration and severity duration d months denotes the start tstart to end tend time of a specific dryness wetness event severity s dimensionless is defined as the sum of the threshold minus the dryness wetness index during the duration that is 1 s dryness w e t n e s s t start t end t h r e s h o l d s s i i where tstart and tend represent the start and end time of dryness wetness events respectively threshold is the dryness wetness threshold that is 0 5 for dryness and 0 5 for wetness and i is a certain time point between tstart and tend the doc concentrations during the dryness wetness events were then extracted using the following equation 2 doc c o n c e n t r a t i o n s t start t end d o c i where doc i is the doc value at time i during a certain dryness wetness duration iv the response relationship model of the doc concentrations to the dryness wetness characteristics under multiple timescales was constructed validated and tested for the model construction and validation we first analyzed the two dimensional relationship between key variables i e relationship between d and s d s d and doc d doc and s and doc s doc and subsequently constructed the three dimensional response relationship models i e relationship among d s and doc that is d s doc using the data from basin hp3a the cross validation method was used for the construction and validation processes and three evaluation indicators namely the coefficient of determination r 2 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and the mean absolute percentage error mape were used to determine the goodness of fit of the model performance the optimal model was selected and further applied to basins hp4 and hp6 this demonstrates the ability of the proposed framework to adopt various basin datasets to construct and validate simulations models and to further apply these models to other basins 3 1 standardized streamflow index ssi the ssi was used to describe the dryness wetness from a hydrological perspective under multiple timescales vicente serrano et al 2011 different timescales of ssi reflect the different dryness wetness conditions for example short timescales e g 1 and 3 months can effectively characterize the variation of short term dryness wetness conditions while ling timescales e g 12 and 24 months describe the long term dryness wetness conditions wu et al 2018 as the different ssi timescales represent different cumulative streamflow anomalies of consecutive months they can reflect the different timescales of hydrological processes vicente serrano et al 2011 for example the 3 month ssi in may is calculated based on the cumulative streamflow from march to may the ssi timescales of 1 3 and 12 months are commonly used to represent dryness wetness variations at the monthly seasonal and annual scale respectively wu et al 2018 the streamflow probability distribution functions were determined and subsequently used to calculate ssi after normal standardization shukla and wood 2008 reported the better applicability of the log normal distribution function for streamflow at different timescales compared to other probability distribution functions detailed calculation procedures of ssi are presented in previous studies vicente serrano et al 2011 wu et al 2016 table 1 reports the ssi classifications of the dryness wetness events based on the classification of ssi the thresholds 0 5 and 0 5 were adopted to identify the dryness and wetness events and their duration and severity respectively ssi values between 0 5 and 0 5 indicate a normal streamflow values larger than 0 5 denote wet conditions and values lower than 0 5 indicate dry conditions 3 2 construction and validation of simulation models the simulation models for doc concentrations based on dryness wetness duration and severity were constructed as a multivariable linear regression model mlrm for basin hp3a first we analyzed the two dimensional relationship between the dryness wetness characteristics and the corresponding doc concentrations that is d s d doc and s doc to obtain the change patterns of these variables and to determine the main influencing variable for the doc concentration patterns the three dimensional relationships i e d s doc among these variables were then examined the general equation for the mlrm is 3 y β 0 β 1 x 1 a β 2 x 2 a β k x ka ε a where β 0 β 1 β 2 β k represent the regression coefficients x1a xka are independent variables for a given site a and ε a is the error term since there are only two independent variables i e d and s in this study the equation 3 is written as 4 y β 0 β 1 x 1 β 2 x 2 where y x 1 and x 2 represent the doc concentration d and s respectively at hp3a the constructed models were used to simulate the doc concentrations during the dryness and wetness events based on the dryness and wetness characteristics i e d and s under multiple timescales each timescale had its own set of regression coefficient numbers the cross validation method was employed to construct the mlrm more specifically the dryness wetness event samples were divided into different groups and each group was further separated into training and test groups for the construction and validation of the simulation model based on the cross validation principle 2 3 of the samples were set as the training set for the model construction and the remaining 1 3 samples were taken as the test set wu et al 2018 three indicators namely r 2 nse and mape equations 5 7 respectively were employed to evaluate the goodness of fit performance of the simulation models in the test set the model with the best simulation results was chosen to represent the optimal model and was applied to other basins 5 r 2 i 1 n o i o i 1 n s i s i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n s i s 2 6 nse 1 i 1 n o i s i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 7 mape 1 n i 1 n o i s i o i 2 where o and s represent the observed and simulated doc concentrations based on the constructed models under a specific timescale i e monthly seasonal or annual the closer the r 2 and nse values mape are to 1 0 the better the simulated values 3 3 application of the simulation model the optimal mape model for the response of doc concentrations to dryness wetness characteristics was applied to simulate doc concentrations during dryness wetness events at the other two monitored sites hp4 and hp6 simulating the doc concentrations of other sites using the same model and regression parameters coefficients obtained from hp3a will output simulation results with varying magnitudes due to the differences in the basin attributes even under the same climate conditions thus the simulated results were corrected teutschbein and seibert 2012 assuming that y represents the simulated values obtained from the optimal simulation model and x represents the observed values we can construct a relationship between x and y to correct the simulated values as 8 x y b k where k and b represent the correction coefficients 4 results and discussion 4 1 variation of dryness wetness and doc patterns under different timescales the fluctuation magnitudes of ssi varied with the timescale during the 41 year study period fig 3 the 1 and 3 month ssi exhibited large fluctuations while the 12 month ssi was relatively more stable several dryness or wetness events identified by the short timescale ssi were included in the longer duration dryness or wetness events identified by the long timescale ssi the 12 month ssi reveals the trends of the harp lake catchment to have shifted between wet and dry during the study period with the fluctuations dry trend wet trend dry trend wet trend dry trend wet trend during 1978 1982 1983 1985 1986 1987 1988 1995 1996 1999 and 2000 2019 respectively the dry trend denotes a change towards drying while the wet trend indicates a change towards wetting the variations in doc concentrations exhibited a similar pattern generally shifting between decreasing and increasing trends over the four decades in addition low doc values corresponded to low ssi values particularly for the 12 month timescale table 2 summarizes the statistical characteristics of the dryness and wetness events and their corresponding doc concentrations based on the results of fig 3 the number of dryness wetness events decreased with the increasing timescale while the opposite was true for the average duration and severity the maximum duration and severity for dryness wetness events also increased with the ssi timescale based on the three ssi timescales the minimum dryness wetness duration is 1 month while the minimum severity is close to the dryness wetness threshold moreover the mean and minimum doc concentrations during the dryness events increased with the dryness wetness index timescale while the wetness events decreased the maximum doc concentrations during both the dryness and wetness events decreased with the dryness wetness timescale as the sliding window increased based on the method of dryness wetness index the average maximum and minimum doc concentrations during the wetness events exceeded those of the dryness events under each timescale 4 2 simulation models for doc based on dryness wetness characteristics 4 2 1 two and three dimensional relationships fig 4 depicts the two dimensional relationships for the d s d doc and s doc models which passed the significance test p 0 00 at the hp3a site the dryness wetness severity increased with the dryness wetness event duration in addition the doc concentrations during the dryness wetness events increased with the duration and severity of the dryness wetness events the majority of dryness wetness event samples were located in the 95 prediction range of the linear models the 95 prediction range for d doc was smaller or narrower than that of s doc indicating that the importance of dryness wetness duration for the cumulative effect of doc concentration was larger than that of severity the import export of doc in the basin depended more on the length of the dryness wetness duration rather than the magnitude the longer the dryness wetness duration the higher the doc concentrations longer rains for example can wash out more terrestrial chemicals into rivers while rainfall intensity may play a secondary role in these processes murphy et al 2015 the three dimensional relationships among d s doc during the dryness wetness events were also strong fig 5 that is doc concentrations increased with d and s 4 2 2 construction and validation of simulation models according to the cross validation principles the dryness wetness event samples were divided into three groups for each ssi timescale at the hp3 site for example there were 65 dryness event samples for the 1 month scale table 2 for hp3 site these 65 dryness events were initially sorted into chronological order i e from 1 to 65 the upper 2 3 samples from 1 to 43 middle 2 3 from 12 to 54 and lower 2 3 from 45 65 and 1 11 i e 43 samples in each group were set as the training groups and the remaining 1 3 samples i e 22 samples were taken as the test groups this cross validation was also applied to the remaining two timescales thus we constructed three models with the same structure but varying parameters for each dryness wetness timescale the optimal model was then selected based on the evaluation indicators table 3 reports the statistics of the evaluation indicators for each simulation model under different timescales from the evaluation indicators for the dryness events the goodness of fit performance of the simulation models in group 3 of the 1 month timescale group 1 of the 3 month timescale and group 3 of the 12 month timescale are better than the other groups in the same timescale for the wetness events the evaluation indicators of group 1 of the 1 month timescale group 1 of the 3 month timescale and group 2 of the 12 month timescale indicate a better performance than the other group models based on this the best performing models were selected as the optimal models to simulate the doc concentrations during the dryness wetness events in the corresponding timescales table 4 lists the optimal doc concentration simulation models based on the dryness wetness characteristics under different timescales at the hp3a site the variations in the simulated and observed doc concentrations exhibited a similar trend in each timescale for the test events fig 6 the doc concentrations during the dryness wetness events can be simulated well with the calibrated models 4 2 3 application of the simulation models hp4 and hp6 the optimal simulation model of the doc concentrations constructed based on the hp3a dataset was applied to monitoring sites hp4 and hp6 we compared the simulated results corrected and uncorrected and observed values fig 7 the corrected equations for the simulated doc concentrations at hp4 and hp6 are reported in table s1 and table s2 respectively although both the uncorrected and corrected simulated doc concentrations in different timescales exhibited a good relationship with the observed values the corrected values were closer to the 1 1 line and better than the uncorrected values which had obvious underestimating bias all the evaluation indicators indicated a good performance for the corrected values table 5 the optimal simulation models combined with the proposed correction method can be applied to simulate doc concentrations during dryness wetness events for study catchments 4 3 discussion 4 3 1 simulation models of doc concentrations in dryness wetness periods in this study we constructed the simulation models of doc concentration responses to dryness wetness characteristics under multiple timescales the commonly used ssi was used to describe the dryness wetness at the monthly seasonal and annual scales the models exhibited a good performance in simulating doc concentrations during dryness wetness events under different timescales by considering the correction coefficients of the simulation models the optimal models from one basin could be applied to other nearby basins previous research has constructed response relationship models of doc concentrations to hydrological drought i e streamflow deficits characteristics wu et al 2022 however they did not simultaneously consider both dryness and wetness characteristics and failed to account for the multiple timescales of hydrological processes the current study improved on these limitations the continuous daily process of doc can be simulated by constructing a physically process based basin model such as the semi distributed model swat zhang et al 2020 the lumped model hbv shih et al 2019 or the regional hydro ecological simulation system rouhani et al 2021 however such models with a complex structure and extensive parameters need to be calibrated which proves to be a difficult task in addition even when calibrated these models cannot guarantee the simulation accuracy of different phase flow processes vrugt et al 2005 relatively simple statistical regression models can simulate doc concentrations by considering hydrochemistry factors closely related to doc concentrations if the long term measurements are available this has been confirmed in previous studies in the boreal shield lakes canada keller et al 2008 harp lake catchment canada wu et al 2022 and the upper yangtze river china ni et al 2020 as well as in the present case study this is because the observed streamflow and doc concentrations contain key information driven by controlling physical mechanisms and hydrological characteristics such as event duration and severity have a strong influence on the formulation of doc concentrations the proposed framework has the following four advantages i the standardized dryness wetness index was used in the framework which facilitates the modelling of other catchments when the correction coefficients are considered ii multiple dryness wetness timescales were considered helping to understand the dynamic patterns of doc concentration responses to different hydrological processes and stages iii the cross validation method was employed in the model construction and validation process which can minimize the uncertainty of the model results and iv most importantly the proposed framework may be applied to other basins in different regions if the data is available using the same model structure but different parameters to construct the simulation models of other catchments is also feasible if there are sufficient measurements i e biondi and de luca 2015 wu et al 2022 however we employed the correction coefficient method in this study as it is able to deal with insufficient lacking data of other basins although the correction coefficient method needs to be calibrated to the measured data it is able to demonstrate the usefulness of the constructed models in particular it highlights the process of simulating doc concentrations in a data free catchment 4 3 2 variation of doc concentrations and dryness wetness patterns the variation of dryness wetness in the harp lake catchment generally exhibits six phases of changing trends namely dry wet dry wet dry wet during 1978 1982 1983 1985 1986 1987 1988 1995 1996 1999 and 2000 2019 these variation patterns with streamflow should be addressed in the doc calculations and assessments in terms of long term changes following 2000 a wetting trend was generally observed for the 1 year ssi the annual streamflow increased slightly without a significant trend in the past four decades nalley et al 2016 wu et al 2022 yao et al 2011 previous studies argue that the annual streamflow will increase by 12 in the future compared to that over the base period from 1961 to 1990 in the detroit river southern ontario due to global warming rahman et al 2012 we also observed large variations in the average doc concentrations during the dryness and wetness periods more specifically average doc concentrations during dryness events were lower than those of the wetness events this agrees with previous studies e g blaurock et al 2021 dong et al 2021 ritson et al 2017 the release of doc from terrestrial ecological systems is inhibited or restricted during periods of low precipitation and runoff but subsequently increases in the rewetting period blaurock et al 2021 dalzell et al 2005 majidzadeh et al 2017 although it will take some time for the doc export import response to be activated following variations in the streamflow process average doc concentrations are generally low high during the dryness wetness periods the average duration and severity of dryness wetness increased with the ssi timescales this can be attributed to the moving window method used to calculate the ssi process leading to a short duration dryness wetness event extracted by the short term ssi being included in a long duration dryness wetness event identified by the long term ssi wu et al 2018 the average annual doc concentrations at sites hp3a hp4 and hp6 increased significantly by 0 10 mg l p 0 02 0 34 mg l p 0 00 and 0 69 mg l p 0 00 per 10 years during the study period fig s1 respectively this supports the doc concentration increase under the 12 month moving average scenario fig 3 d e f in our previous studies we attributed the increases in doc concentrations in the harp lake catchment to decreases in so4 due to changes in temperature and ph wu et al 2022 in fact doc concentrations have increased in rivers throughout the world clark et al 2006 morison et al 2022 worral and burt 2008 with most reported changes occurring in catchments that may experience increased temperature and decreases in ionic strength and soil solution acidity fenner et al 2021 hruska et al 2009 monteith et al 2007 moreover changes in land use and biogeochemical boundary conditions have also enhanced doc concentrations in surface waters and altered water quality ahearn et al 2005 cookson et al 2007 dhillon and inamdar 2013 the simulation performance in hp6 site was weaker than that in hp4 table 5 we suspected that the performance differences between the sites were related to the two households upstream of site hp6 whose domestic sewage may have interfered with the natural doc concentration dynamics for example hp6 exhibits higher average doc concentrations but has smaller catchment than hp4 the routine management of doc concentrations during dryness wetness events can therefore help to comply with water quality directives and reduce the costs of drinking water purification however knowledge on how doc changes and moves within and across terrestrial aquatic interfaces is still limited and in particular its link to carbon cycles at the event scale remains unclear this is beyond the scope of this study and will be explored in future work 4 3 3 limitations and further work the framework proposed in the current study provides a newer perspective to improve our understanding on the dynamic patterns of doc concentrations during dryness wetness events however it also has several limitations first we did not consider the impacts of different return periods of dryness wetness events on the dynamic patterns of doc concentrations for example the driving mechanism of extreme hydrometeorological events on the doc export import from land to rivers is extremely complex under different spatial and temporal conditions for the same event or different return period at the event scale clark et al 2006 monteith et al 2007 worral and burt 2008 further analysis on the influence mechanism on doc dynamic patterns can help us to better understand the variations of doc patterns under changing environments second although the ssi is commonly used as a dryness wetness index from the hydrological perspective it is associated with several bottlenecks for example it is sensitive to the quantity and reliability of data used to fit the distribution functions vicente serrano et al 2011 and assumes that all dry and wet levels have the same occurrence probability in different months wu et al 2018 shukla wood 2008 however ssi still remains the most widely used dryness wetness index further research is required to improve the index or to propose a new index third our methods simulated doc concentrations over a dryness or wetness event that is several months long providing the cumulative doc over an event however they do not provide daily doc results or details within an event this is reserved for future research 5 conclusions the present study is among the first to assess the doc dynamic patterns during different timescales of dryness wetness events an integrated framework for the construction validation and application of statistical simulation models from multiple timescales is proposed the key conclusions are summarized as follows i doc dynamic patterns vary between the dryness and wetness periods in which the dryness period exhibits lower average doc concentrations compared to the wetness period for the monthly seasonal and annual scales the average maximum and minimum doc concentrations during the dryness events increased with the dryness wetness index timescales but decreased during the wetness events ii a clear and strong three dimensional relationship for d s doc during dryness wetness events is observed and doc concentrations increase with d and s the importance of the dryness wetness duration is larger than that of severity iii based on the corresponding dryness wetness characteristics the doc concentration simulation models for the dryness wetness periods can accurately simulate the doc concentrations in the harp lake catchment the optimal models can be directly applied to other basins with similar climate and basin features when the correction coefficients are considered iv although there are still many challenges in the simulation of doc concentrations during extreme hydrometeorological events the results of this study indicate the potential in simulating doc concentrations during the dryness wetness periods credit

2832,flood is one of the most prevalent natural disasters and extreme precipitation events are the principal cause of most flooding understanding climate change impacts on extreme precipitation is vital for sustainable infrastructure development and water resources management there are different methods to downscale precipitation to local scale from the global climate models simulations available at coarse resolution the change factor cf method is one of those widely used methods for downscaling extreme precipitation however there are many variations in the cf method and no study is available reporting the best cf method for downscaling extreme precipitation until today consequently this study aims to evaluate different variants of four change factor methods namely additive constant scaling acs additive daily scaling ads multiplicative constant scaling mcs and multiplicative daily scaling mds for simulating extreme precipitation over india further the optimum size of the baseline period for all four change factor methods and the optimum number of change factors for the daily scaling method are also evaluated a total of 80 variants of four change factor methods namely acs ads mcs and mds are formulated by varying the size of the baseline period and the number of change factors in the daily scaling method change factor methods are evaluated in terms of their capability in downscaling the annual maximum am precipitation series and four extreme precipitation series extracted with peaks over threshold pot method the results indicate that the daily scaling methods ads and mds are the best change factor method for more than 75 3713 out of 4948 of imd grids for downscaling extreme precipitation it is also observed that the variants of the daily scaling method having 100 change factors are alone the best change factor method for 35 1708 out of 4948 of imd grids for downscaling extreme precipitation however change factor methods having a smaller number of change factors including constant scaling variants are consistent compared to the variants of the daily scaling method having 100 change factors keywords change factor method climate change downscaling extreme precipitation data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction flood is one of the most prevalent natural disasters and the principal cause of most flooding is extreme precipitation duan et al 2017 climate change contributes to fluctuations in the global water cycle leading to higher flood risk milly et al 2002 a significant proportion of climate related destruction caused by extreme precipitation alone has a more extensive impact than other precipitation events kunkel et al 1999 the precipitation records obtained primarily from rain gauges over land indicate that most of the world s extreme precipitation series have a significant increasing trend asadieh and krakauer 2015 o gorman 2015 studies suggest that anthropogenic factors like the rise in atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases have led to the worldwide intensification of extreme precipitation lin et al 2016 o gorman 2015 willett et al 2007 as the global temperature increases it is expected that the atmospheric water holding capacity will rise roughly exponentially leading to an increase in extreme precipitation ali and mishra 2017 min et al 2011 further the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc suggests that the proportion of total precipitation from extreme events is estimated to increase in the 21st century over various parts of the globe especially in tropical regions and high latitudes and in the northern mid latitudes during winter field et al 2011 the annual maximum precipitation over majority of india exhibits an increasing trend in recent periods which is more prominent in southern india than northern india mukherjee et al 2018 several previous studies suggest a substantial rise in extreme precipitation in terms of intensity and frequency in the last few decades in india ali et al 2019 goswami et al 2006 krishnamurthy et al 2009 rajendran et al 2013 therefore understanding the climate change impacts on extreme precipitation is vital to study the climate change impacts the global climate models gcm simulations under different ipcc scenarios are used however since the climate models simulations are available only at coarse scale the climate models simulations should be downscaled to the local scale for the climate change impact studies several literatures use different downscaling approaches to study the impacts of climate change on precipitation dynamic and statistical approaches are the two main approaches to downscale climate data however since statistical downscaling methods are computationally efficient and easy to use fowler et al 2007 salvi et al 2013 the statistical downscaling techniques are preferred over the dynamic downscaling method for impact assessment studies and projecting the changes in extreme precipitation agilan and umamahesh 2016 madsen et al 2014 researchers have modelled the climate change impacts on extreme precipitation using different approaches for example the change factor method agilan and umamahesh 2016 hansen et al 2017 hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2018 2017 laflamme et al 2015 sunyer et al 2015 maria antonia sunyer et al 2015 sunyer et al 2012 willems and vrac 2011 yang et al 2012 yilmaz 2017 equidistance quantile matching method şen and kahya 2021 singh et al 2016 srivastav et al 2014 regression based statistical downscaling method herath et al 2016 yang et al 2012 weather typing method boé et al 2006 willems and vrac 2011 and quantile regression tareghian and rasmussen 2013 sunyer et al 2015 compared three different statistical downscaling methods for analysing the changes in hourly extreme precipitation and highlighted the need to use a range of statistical downscaling methods for accurate downscaling of extreme precipitation among various statistical downscaling methods the change factor cf method is a widely used and relatively straightforward technique for assessment of climate change impacts on extreme precipitation agilan and umamahesh 2016 hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2017 2018 laflamme et al 2015 sunyer et al 2012 2015 yang et al 2012 yilmaz 2017 zahmatkesh et al 2015 the change factor method provides direct scaling of the gcm by integrating data from locally observed records diaz nieto and wilby 2005 karamouz et al 2013 switanek et al 2017 conceptually compared additive and multiplicative change factor methods and suggested a multiplicative change factor method for precipitation and an additive change factor method for temperature however there are different types of change factor methods cfm categorized by temporal scale temporal resolution mathematical formulation or the number of change factors anandhi et al 2011 in specific the change factor method calculates the changes in precipitation as change factors using the gcm simulations for historical and future time periods then the future downscaled precipitation series is obtained by applying these change factors to the observed precipitation data of the historical period however based on how the change factors are calculated from gcm simulations and applied to the observed precipitation data there are many variations in the cfm generally the change factors are calculated using the daily scaling ds and constant scaling cs methods the change factors are either added or multiplied to the observed precipitation data of the historical period this itself creates four variants of change factor methods namely additive constant scaling acs additive daily scaling ads multiplicative constant scaling mcs and multiplicative daily scaling mds further the parameters value of change factor methods such as baseline period and the number of change factors in the daily scaling method also create further cf method variants this leads to the question which change factor method is the best for downscaling extreme precipitation till today no study is available addressing this question consequently the objectives of the study are 1 to evaluate all variants of change factor methods in downscaling extreme precipitation over india 2 to find the optimum size of baseline period for different cf methods 3 to find the optimum number of cfs for the daily scaling method 2 data a high resolution gridded 0 25 longitude 0 25 latitude daily precipitation dataset prepared by the india meteorological department imd is used for this study this gridded data was developed by pai et al 2014 based on the precipitation records from 6955 rain gauges located in india more details on the preparation of this high resolution gridded daily precipitation dataset can be obtained from pai et al 2014 this dataset is increasingly being used in studies on indian precipitation pai et al 2015 though the dataset is available from 1901 as the climate change signals are visible only towards the end of the 20th century mondal and mujumdar 2015 and the data density was relatively higher 3100 stations per day pai et al 2014 after 1951 the period 1952 2019 68 years comprising 4948 grid points is considered for the current study in this study the change factor methods are evaluated using the observed historical data i e imd gridded data from 1952 to 2019 note that the non stationarity in extreme rainfall characteristics over india has been reported in several previous studies ali et al 2019 ali and mishra 2017 goswami et al 2006 khan et al 2019 krishnamurthy et al 2009 mondal and mujumdar 2015 rajendran et al 2013 for example khan et al 2019 analysed the trend in the gridded daily rainfall data 0 25 x 0 25 over india from 1901 to 2015 using the mann kendall trend test and reported a significant increase in the extreme precipitation further mondal and mujumdar 2015 modelled the non stationarity in the extreme rainfall characteristics i e intensity duration and frequency using the gridded daily rainfall data over india moreover in this study the trend in the annual maximum series for 1952 2019 the period considered for evaluating change factor methods is analyzed using the non parametric mann kendall trend test kendall 1962 mann 1945 the spatial variation of the mann kendall test result for the annual maximum series of india is shown in fig s1 and it supports the results of previous studies i e extreme rainfall over india has a non stationary component therefore using imd gridded rainfall data for the period of 1952 2019 to evaluate different change factor methods in downscaling extreme precipitation over india is appropriate 3 methodology this research aims to evaluate the change factor methods in downscaling extreme precipitation for this 80 variants of four change factor methods namely acs ads mcs and mds are formulated by varying the size of the baseline period and the number of change factors in the daily scaling method change factor methods are evaluated in terms of their capability in downscaling the annual maximum am precipitation series and four extreme precipitation series extracted with peaks over threshold pot method the general methodology used to achieve the objectives is shown in fig 1 as a flowchart as mentioned earlier there are different types of cfm categorized by temporal scale temporal resolution mathematical formulation or the number of change factors anandhi et al 2011 in general for downscaling daily precipitation using cfm a baseline period and future period of equal length are chosen representing the base climate and future climate for example if 30 years of data are used as a baseline another 30 years of future data from gcm simulations represent future climate in this study to evaluate the change factor methods the historical daily precipitation data is divided into the baseline and evaluation periods with equal length the performance indicator is calculated between observed and downscaled simulated extreme precipitation series in the evaluation periods to evaluate the change factor methods further four different baseline and evaluation periods are considered to assess the influence of the size of the baseline period on change factor methods the chosen baseline and evaluation periods are shown in table 1 the cfm can also be classified either as additive or multiplicative the arithmetic difference between baseline precipitation and evaluation precipitation is calculated in additive cfm the difference is then added to the observed values to obtain the simulated precipitation in this method a problem may arise due to negative precipitation which can be eliminated by limiting the lower value to zero another concern is when the observed historical precipitation is zero and the corresponding change factor is positive an artificial increase in the number of precipitation events occurs hansen et al 2017 the artificial increase in the precipitation can be prevented by making the downscaled value zero when observed precipitation in the baseline period is zero in multiplicative cfm instead of finding the difference the ratio is calculated between baseline data and evaluation data the observed values are then multiplied by the ratio that is the multiplicative change factor in addition the daily scaling cfm can be categorized based on the number of change factors used in it the details of change factor methods are provided in the following sub sections 3 1 constant scaling the constant scaling method or delta change method implements a constant factor to observed historical daily precipitation data to obtain simulated downscaled precipitation anandhi et al 2011 fowler et al 2007 gooré bi et al 2017 hansen et al 2017 mpelasoka and chiew 2009 the constant factor is estimated as the difference or ratio of baseline precipitation and evaluation precipitation the constant scaling method is graphically depicted in fig 2 the initial step of constant scaling is to determine the mean monthly values of precipitation during the baseline and evaluation periods to estimate additive or multiplicative cf in specific from the daily precipitation series the monthly precipitation series is calculated from the monthly precipitation series the average monthly precipitation for each month is calculated the next step calculates additive or multiplicative change factors i e c f add and c f mul using eq 1 and eq 2 respectively 1 c f add p e p b 2 c f mul p e p b here p b and p e are the mean precipitation during baseline and evaluation periods respectively the downscaled precipitation values are determined by applying cf to the observed precipitation data using either eq 3 or eq 4 3 ls f add i o b s i c f add 4 ls f mul i o b s i c f mul where ls f add i and ls f mul i represent the downscaled values for additive and multiplicative cases respectively the observed precipitation data is denoted by ob s i at each time step i over the time period for example to obtain the downscaled daily precipitation value for january months in the evaluation period the change factor value of january month is added to or multiplied by the observed daily precipitation values of the baseline period as mentioned earlier there may arise a problem for the additive case due to negative precipitation which is eliminated by limiting the lower value to zero further when the observed historical precipitation is zero and the corresponding change factor is positive an artificial increase in the number of precipitation events arises in the additive cf methods hansen et al 2017 the artificial increase in the number of precipitation days is prevented by making the downscaled value zero when observed precipitation in the baseline period is zero 3 2 daily scaling the daily scaling method also called quantile quantile mapping chiew et al 2009 gooré bi et al 2017 mpelasoka and chiew 2009 willems and vrac 2011 similar to cs employs the observed historical daily precipitation series to obtain a future daily precipitation series the ds accounts for changes in the different precipitation percentiles in the daily precipitation series unlike the cs method which employs the same constant factor for all precipitation values occurs in a month fig 3 depicts the procedure for the daily scaling method in daily scaling the first step is to compute the empirical cumulative distribution function cdf of daily precipitation for both baseline and evaluation periods for cdf computation the daily precipitation values above 1 mm are used unlike cs the number of change factors in the daily scaling varies based on the number of divisions we make in the cdf for example we can divide the cdf into ten parts i e 10th 20th 100th percentile and calculate ten change factors or we can divide the cdf into 100 parts i e 1st 2nd 100th percentile and calculate 100 change factors since the study also tries to find the optimum number of change factors in the daily scaling a different possible number of change factors are considered in this study in specific daily scaling methods are evaluated with 100 20 10 6 5 4 3 2 and 1 change factors by dividing the cdf at each 1 5 10 15 20 25 30 50 and 100 percentiles respectively the cfs are calculated using eq 1 and eq 2 however instead of mean precipitation the percentile values are used to find the difference or ratio in eq 1 and eq 2 for example in the case of additive cf if the cdf is divided at every 25th percentile the first cf is obtained by taking the difference of the 25th percentile value in the baseline period and the 25th percentile value in the evaluation period similar to cs the downscaled simulated daily precipitation series is obtained using either eq 3 or eq 4 however the change factor is applied in the following way the cf found for xth percentile is added or multiplied to baseline precipitation which has an intensity greater than x 1 th percentile and less than or equal to xth percentile the percentiles are determined using the cdf of observed precipitation data for the baseline period 3 3 comparison of change factor methods since the manuscript aims to evaluate change factor methods in downscaling extreme precipitation change factor methods are evaluated in terms of their capability in downscaling extreme precipitation series for this different extreme precipitation series have to be extracted from both observed and simulated downscaled daily precipitation series the word extreme may refer to many different things in the climate literature and there is no unique climatological definition for it stephenson 2008 however in the case of precipitation an extreme can be reasonably well defined referring to the values in the tails of the distribution that would be expected to occur infrequently zhang and zwiers 2013 the am and pot are commonly used approaches to extract extreme quantiles therefore in this study the change factor methods are evaluated in simulating downscaling extreme precipitation series extracted with the am and pot methods for the pot method the threshold values are fixed at 90 pot90 92 5 pot92 5 95 pot95 and 97 5 pot97 5 percentile of observed daily precipitation values which are above 1 mm five extreme precipitation series i e one annual maximum series and four extreme precipitation series with pot method are extracted from both observed and simulated downscaled precipitation of evaluation period for each grid point since different extreme percentiles increase at different rates pendergrass 2018 wasko and sharma 2017 and the sample size may vary between observed and simulated downscaled pot series the extreme precipitation series are fitted with empirical cdf and 101 quantiles corresponding to 0 to 100th percentile in the cdf are used for the evaluation the performance of change factor methods is measured using root mean squared error rmse eq 5 in specific the performance indicator rmse is calculated between 101 quantiles of observed and simulated downscaled extreme precipitation series 5 rmse i 1 n x i x i 2 n where x i and x i indicate quantiles of observed precipitation and downscaled precipitation during evaluation period respectively n represents the sample size note that initially the change factor methods are evaluated with three performance indicators i e rmse coefficient of determination and nash sutcliffe efficiency however based on the average value for entire india the change factor methods are better differentiable with rmse than the other two performance indicators i e coefficient of determination and nash sutcliffe efficiency specifically since the manuscript presents the results for entire india the difference in the average value of other two error matrices i e coefficient of determination and nash sutcliffe efficiency is small between the change factor methods therefore the results based on the performance indicator rmse are presented in this manuscript however it is suggested to use multiple performance indicators if the aim is to compare change factor methods for a single a few precipitation station s 4 results and discussion to evaluate the change factor methods in downscaling extreme precipitation 80 variants refer table 2 of the four change factor methods namely acs ads mcs and mds are implemented for the study area i e 4948 imd grids over india as mentioned earlier five extreme precipitation series are extracted for each grid point from observed and downscaled simulated daily precipitation during the evaluation period using the annual maximum and pot methods the performance indicator rmse is calculated between observed and downscaled simulated extreme precipitation series the rmse between observed am series and am series extracted from the downscaled simulated precipitation series using cfm45 multiplicative daily scaling with 100 change factors and 20 years base period for all the 4948 grid points is shown in fig 4 a similarly the rmse between observed pot series and pot series extracted from the downscaled simulated precipitation series using cfm45 for all the 4948 grid points is shown in fig 4 b e as it is impossible to show similar plots for all 80 variants refer table 2 of change factor methods the average rmse for the entire india based on 4948 imd grids is calculated for all change factor methods reported in table 2 from table 2 it is seen that the cfm 7 multiplicative constant scaling with 30 years base period has the lowest average rmse between observed and downscaled simulated annual maximum extreme precipitation series over india similarly from table 2 it is seen that the cfm 62 multiplicative daily scaling with one change factor and 25 years base period is having the lowest average rmse between observed and downscaled simulated pot precipitation series extracted with all four threshold values i e pot90 pot92 5 pot95 and pot97 5 further cfm 6 multiplicative constant scaling with 25 years base period has the minimum average for all five extreme precipitation series rmse note that the best change factor method for an imd grid point could be different from the one which is having the lowest average rmse across india therefore each imd grid point s best change factor method is analyzed for all extreme precipitation series the cfm with the lowest rmse between observed and downscaled simulated extreme precipitation series is considered the best cfm for that extreme precipitation series of that grid point the best cfm for am series of each imd grid is shown in fig 5 a similarly the best cfm method for pot precipitation series extracted with all four threshold values i e pot90 pot92 5 pot95 and pot97 5 is shown in fig 5 b e the best cfm for all five extreme precipitation series is shown in fig 5 f from fig 5 among the 80 variants of cfm it is seen that the best cfm varies significantly with respect to grid point therefore to analyze the best change factor method among acs ads mcs and mds the 80 variants of cfm are broadly classified into these four groups and the best group for each imd grid point is analyzed the best change factor method group among acs ads mcs and mds for am series of each imd grid is shown in fig 6 a similarly the best change factor method group among acs ads mcs and mds for pot precipitation series extracted with all four threshold values i e pot90 pot92 5 pot95 and pot97 5 is shown in fig 6 b e the best change factor method group among acs ads mcs and mds for the all five extreme precipitation series is shown in fig 6 f on an average across five extreme precipitation series among acs ads mcs and mds the mds is the best change factor method for around 50 2465 out of 4948 of imd grids the next best change factor method groups are ads mcs and acs having a share of around 25 1245 out of 4948 24 1176 out of 4948 and 1 59 out of 4948 respectively in other words there exists a spatial dependency in the performance of change factor methods a bar chart of the number of grids for which the change factor method group acs ads mcs and mds is the best for different extreme precipitation series is plotted in fig 7 from fig 7 it is noted that the daily scaling methods ads and mds are the best change factor method for more than 75 of imd grids and the constant scaling methods acs and mcs are the best change factor method for less than 25 of imd grids in the case of constant scaling the number of change factors is constant in all variants of constant scaling cfms cfm1 to cfm8 however in the case of daily scaling the number of change factors varies with respect to the variant of daily scaling this leads to the question what should be the number of change factors in the daily scaling method to address the same the daily scaling methods ads and mds ranked as the best method for more than 75 of imd grids are grouped based on the number of change factors in the respective variant of daily scaling methods for example cfm9 cfm18 cfm27 cfm36 cfm45 cfm54 cfm63 and cfm72 are the different daily scaling variants with 100 change factors are grouped similarly different daily scaling variants are grouped with respect to the number of change factors in that variant the number of grids for which the groups of daily scaling method variants having the same number of change factors are the best for different extreme precipitation series is plotted in fig 8 from fig 8 it is clear that the variants of the daily scaling method having 100 change factors is dominating when compared to other variants of daily scaling method having a different number of change factors specifically on average the variants of the daily scaling method having 100 change factors are alone the best change factor method for 35 1708 out of 4948 of imd grids however from table 2 it is seen that the variants of the daily scaling method having 100 change factors cfm9 cfm18 cfm27 cfm36 cfm45 cfm54 cfm63 and cfm72 have a higher average across india rmse when compared to the variants of daily scaling method having a smaller number of change factors among the daily scaling variants the cfm71 has the lowest average across india rmse and has only one change factor calculated at the 100th percentile even all the constant scaling method variants have lesser average across india rmse compared to the variants of the daily scaling method having 100 change factors it indicates that though the variants of the daily scaling method having 100 change factors are alone the best change factor method for 35 of imd grids their performance is poor compared to other variants for the remaining grids this suggests that the change factor methods having 100 change factors may be overfitting the data it denotes that the change factor methods having a smaller number of change factors including constant scaling variants are better compared to variants of the daily scaling method having 100 change factors as the manuscript also tries to find the optimum size of the baseline period for downscaling extreme precipitation using change factor methods all the variants of change factor method groups acs ads mcs and mds are studied for different possible baseline periods 20 25 30 and 34 years to identify the best baseline period the best cfm of each grid point is grouped based on the baseline period used in the variant of the cfm for all extreme precipitation series the spatial variation of the best baseline period for am series is shown in fig 9 a similarly the spatial variation of the best baseline period for pot precipitation series extracted with all four threshold values i e pot90 pot92 5 pot95 and pot97 5 is shown in fig 9 b e the spatial variation of the best baseline period for all five extreme precipitation series is shown in fig 9 f a bar chart of the number of grids for which the particular baseline period is the best for different extreme precipitation series is plotted in fig 10 from figs 9 and 10 it is noted that each one of the four baseline periods chosen for the study is found to be the best baseline period for more than 20 on an average of imd grids it suggests that the study area is not sensitive to the baseline period however the baseline periods 20 years and 34 years are having a slightly higher share when compared to the other two baseline periods 5 summary and conclusions we evaluated the different variants of the change factor method in downscaling extreme precipitation over india daily precipitation series over india from 68 years 1952 2019 of india meteorological department s high resolution gridded 0 25 longitude 0 25 latitude daily precipitation dataset comprises of 4948 grid points are used to evaluate the change factor methods the total time period is divided into baseline period and evaluation period based on the size of the baseline period used in the change factor method variant four baseline periods i e 20 25 30 and 34 years are considered in this study a total of 80 variants of four change factor methods namely acs ads mcs and mds are formulated by varying the size of the baseline period and the number of change factors in the daily scaling method for each imd grid point all 80 variants of the change factor method are applied to downscale the daily precipitation during evaluation period change factor methods are evaluated in terms of their capability in downscaling the annual maximum precipitation series and four extreme precipitation series corresponding to four threshold values i e pot90 pot92 5 pot95 and pot97 5 extracted with pot method the performance indicator rmse is calculated between observed and downscaled simulated extreme precipitation series in the evaluation periods the cfm with the lowest rmse between observed and downscaled simulated extreme precipitation series is considered the best cfm for that extreme precipitation series of that grid point the results indicate that the mds is the best change factor method for around 50 2465 out of 4948 of imd grids the next best change factor method groups are ads mcs and acs having a share of around 25 1245 out of 4948 24 1176 out of 4948 and 1 59 out of 4948 respectively note that the daily scaling methods ads and mds are the best change factor method for more than 75 of imd grids and the constant scaling methods acs and mcs are the best change factor method for less than 25 of imd grids it is also found that the variants of the daily scaling method having 100 change factors are dominating when compared to other variants of daily scaling having a different number of change factors specifically on average the variants of the daily scaling method having 100 change factors are alone the best change factor method for 35 1708 out of 4948 of imd grids though the variants of the daily scaling method having 100 change factors are alone the best change factor method for 35 of imd grids their performance is poor compared to other variants for the remaining grids it indicates that the change factor methods having a smaller number of change factors including constant scaling variants are consistent compared to the variants of the daily scaling method having 100 change factors furthermore all four baseline periods chosen for the study are found to best baseline period for more than 20 on an average of imd grids however the baseline periods 20 years and 34 years are having a slightly higher share when compared to the other two baseline periods note that this manuscript evaluates the different variants of the change factor methods in downscaling extreme precipitation over india however the readers are recommended to note the limitations of the change factor methods for the appropriate usage for example one of the main limitations of change factor methods is the persistence of the same number of rainy days in the future projections when the historical climate data is used as the baseline graham et al 2007 hansen et al 2017 further diaz nieto and wilby 2005 reported that the change factor methods might not be useful for studying the impacts of event frequency and changes in temporal sequencing in this study as we try to have a holistic evaluation of change factor methods in downscaling extreme precipitation all the variants of change factor methods including additive variants are evaluated in downscaling extreme precipitation over india however additive variants of change factor methods are considered a poor choice for precipitation and multiplicative variants of change factor methods are recommended for precipitation switanek et al 2017 the same is observed from our study results i e the additive variants of change factor methods performed better only for a few grids over india therefore it is suggested to use the multiplicative variants of change factor methods for downscaling precipitation

2832,flood is one of the most prevalent natural disasters and extreme precipitation events are the principal cause of most flooding understanding climate change impacts on extreme precipitation is vital for sustainable infrastructure development and water resources management there are different methods to downscale precipitation to local scale from the global climate models simulations available at coarse resolution the change factor cf method is one of those widely used methods for downscaling extreme precipitation however there are many variations in the cf method and no study is available reporting the best cf method for downscaling extreme precipitation until today consequently this study aims to evaluate different variants of four change factor methods namely additive constant scaling acs additive daily scaling ads multiplicative constant scaling mcs and multiplicative daily scaling mds for simulating extreme precipitation over india further the optimum size of the baseline period for all four change factor methods and the optimum number of change factors for the daily scaling method are also evaluated a total of 80 variants of four change factor methods namely acs ads mcs and mds are formulated by varying the size of the baseline period and the number of change factors in the daily scaling method change factor methods are evaluated in terms of their capability in downscaling the annual maximum am precipitation series and four extreme precipitation series extracted with peaks over threshold pot method the results indicate that the daily scaling methods ads and mds are the best change factor method for more than 75 3713 out of 4948 of imd grids for downscaling extreme precipitation it is also observed that the variants of the daily scaling method having 100 change factors are alone the best change factor method for 35 1708 out of 4948 of imd grids for downscaling extreme precipitation however change factor methods having a smaller number of change factors including constant scaling variants are consistent compared to the variants of the daily scaling method having 100 change factors keywords change factor method climate change downscaling extreme precipitation data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction flood is one of the most prevalent natural disasters and the principal cause of most flooding is extreme precipitation duan et al 2017 climate change contributes to fluctuations in the global water cycle leading to higher flood risk milly et al 2002 a significant proportion of climate related destruction caused by extreme precipitation alone has a more extensive impact than other precipitation events kunkel et al 1999 the precipitation records obtained primarily from rain gauges over land indicate that most of the world s extreme precipitation series have a significant increasing trend asadieh and krakauer 2015 o gorman 2015 studies suggest that anthropogenic factors like the rise in atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases have led to the worldwide intensification of extreme precipitation lin et al 2016 o gorman 2015 willett et al 2007 as the global temperature increases it is expected that the atmospheric water holding capacity will rise roughly exponentially leading to an increase in extreme precipitation ali and mishra 2017 min et al 2011 further the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc suggests that the proportion of total precipitation from extreme events is estimated to increase in the 21st century over various parts of the globe especially in tropical regions and high latitudes and in the northern mid latitudes during winter field et al 2011 the annual maximum precipitation over majority of india exhibits an increasing trend in recent periods which is more prominent in southern india than northern india mukherjee et al 2018 several previous studies suggest a substantial rise in extreme precipitation in terms of intensity and frequency in the last few decades in india ali et al 2019 goswami et al 2006 krishnamurthy et al 2009 rajendran et al 2013 therefore understanding the climate change impacts on extreme precipitation is vital to study the climate change impacts the global climate models gcm simulations under different ipcc scenarios are used however since the climate models simulations are available only at coarse scale the climate models simulations should be downscaled to the local scale for the climate change impact studies several literatures use different downscaling approaches to study the impacts of climate change on precipitation dynamic and statistical approaches are the two main approaches to downscale climate data however since statistical downscaling methods are computationally efficient and easy to use fowler et al 2007 salvi et al 2013 the statistical downscaling techniques are preferred over the dynamic downscaling method for impact assessment studies and projecting the changes in extreme precipitation agilan and umamahesh 2016 madsen et al 2014 researchers have modelled the climate change impacts on extreme precipitation using different approaches for example the change factor method agilan and umamahesh 2016 hansen et al 2017 hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2018 2017 laflamme et al 2015 sunyer et al 2015 maria antonia sunyer et al 2015 sunyer et al 2012 willems and vrac 2011 yang et al 2012 yilmaz 2017 equidistance quantile matching method şen and kahya 2021 singh et al 2016 srivastav et al 2014 regression based statistical downscaling method herath et al 2016 yang et al 2012 weather typing method boé et al 2006 willems and vrac 2011 and quantile regression tareghian and rasmussen 2013 sunyer et al 2015 compared three different statistical downscaling methods for analysing the changes in hourly extreme precipitation and highlighted the need to use a range of statistical downscaling methods for accurate downscaling of extreme precipitation among various statistical downscaling methods the change factor cf method is a widely used and relatively straightforward technique for assessment of climate change impacts on extreme precipitation agilan and umamahesh 2016 hosseinzadehtalaei et al 2017 2018 laflamme et al 2015 sunyer et al 2012 2015 yang et al 2012 yilmaz 2017 zahmatkesh et al 2015 the change factor method provides direct scaling of the gcm by integrating data from locally observed records diaz nieto and wilby 2005 karamouz et al 2013 switanek et al 2017 conceptually compared additive and multiplicative change factor methods and suggested a multiplicative change factor method for precipitation and an additive change factor method for temperature however there are different types of change factor methods cfm categorized by temporal scale temporal resolution mathematical formulation or the number of change factors anandhi et al 2011 in specific the change factor method calculates the changes in precipitation as change factors using the gcm simulations for historical and future time periods then the future downscaled precipitation series is obtained by applying these change factors to the observed precipitation data of the historical period however based on how the change factors are calculated from gcm simulations and applied to the observed precipitation data there are many variations in the cfm generally the change factors are calculated using the daily scaling ds and constant scaling cs methods the change factors are either added or multiplied to the observed precipitation data of the historical period this itself creates four variants of change factor methods namely additive constant scaling acs additive daily scaling ads multiplicative constant scaling mcs and multiplicative daily scaling mds further the parameters value of change factor methods such as baseline period and the number of change factors in the daily scaling method also create further cf method variants this leads to the question which change factor method is the best for downscaling extreme precipitation till today no study is available addressing this question consequently the objectives of the study are 1 to evaluate all variants of change factor methods in downscaling extreme precipitation over india 2 to find the optimum size of baseline period for different cf methods 3 to find the optimum number of cfs for the daily scaling method 2 data a high resolution gridded 0 25 longitude 0 25 latitude daily precipitation dataset prepared by the india meteorological department imd is used for this study this gridded data was developed by pai et al 2014 based on the precipitation records from 6955 rain gauges located in india more details on the preparation of this high resolution gridded daily precipitation dataset can be obtained from pai et al 2014 this dataset is increasingly being used in studies on indian precipitation pai et al 2015 though the dataset is available from 1901 as the climate change signals are visible only towards the end of the 20th century mondal and mujumdar 2015 and the data density was relatively higher 3100 stations per day pai et al 2014 after 1951 the period 1952 2019 68 years comprising 4948 grid points is considered for the current study in this study the change factor methods are evaluated using the observed historical data i e imd gridded data from 1952 to 2019 note that the non stationarity in extreme rainfall characteristics over india has been reported in several previous studies ali et al 2019 ali and mishra 2017 goswami et al 2006 khan et al 2019 krishnamurthy et al 2009 mondal and mujumdar 2015 rajendran et al 2013 for example khan et al 2019 analysed the trend in the gridded daily rainfall data 0 25 x 0 25 over india from 1901 to 2015 using the mann kendall trend test and reported a significant increase in the extreme precipitation further mondal and mujumdar 2015 modelled the non stationarity in the extreme rainfall characteristics i e intensity duration and frequency using the gridded daily rainfall data over india moreover in this study the trend in the annual maximum series for 1952 2019 the period considered for evaluating change factor methods is analyzed using the non parametric mann kendall trend test kendall 1962 mann 1945 the spatial variation of the mann kendall test result for the annual maximum series of india is shown in fig s1 and it supports the results of previous studies i e extreme rainfall over india has a non stationary component therefore using imd gridded rainfall data for the period of 1952 2019 to evaluate different change factor methods in downscaling extreme precipitation over india is appropriate 3 methodology this research aims to evaluate the change factor methods in downscaling extreme precipitation for this 80 variants of four change factor methods namely acs ads mcs and mds are formulated by varying the size of the baseline period and the number of change factors in the daily scaling method change factor methods are evaluated in terms of their capability in downscaling the annual maximum am precipitation series and four extreme precipitation series extracted with peaks over threshold pot method the general methodology used to achieve the objectives is shown in fig 1 as a flowchart as mentioned earlier there are different types of cfm categorized by temporal scale temporal resolution mathematical formulation or the number of change factors anandhi et al 2011 in general for downscaling daily precipitation using cfm a baseline period and future period of equal length are chosen representing the base climate and future climate for example if 30 years of data are used as a baseline another 30 years of future data from gcm simulations represent future climate in this study to evaluate the change factor methods the historical daily precipitation data is divided into the baseline and evaluation periods with equal length the performance indicator is calculated between observed and downscaled simulated extreme precipitation series in the evaluation periods to evaluate the change factor methods further four different baseline and evaluation periods are considered to assess the influence of the size of the baseline period on change factor methods the chosen baseline and evaluation periods are shown in table 1 the cfm can also be classified either as additive or multiplicative the arithmetic difference between baseline precipitation and evaluation precipitation is calculated in additive cfm the difference is then added to the observed values to obtain the simulated precipitation in this method a problem may arise due to negative precipitation which can be eliminated by limiting the lower value to zero another concern is when the observed historical precipitation is zero and the corresponding change factor is positive an artificial increase in the number of precipitation events occurs hansen et al 2017 the artificial increase in the precipitation can be prevented by making the downscaled value zero when observed precipitation in the baseline period is zero in multiplicative cfm instead of finding the difference the ratio is calculated between baseline data and evaluation data the observed values are then multiplied by the ratio that is the multiplicative change factor in addition the daily scaling cfm can be categorized based on the number of change factors used in it the details of change factor methods are provided in the following sub sections 3 1 constant scaling the constant scaling method or delta change method implements a constant factor to observed historical daily precipitation data to obtain simulated downscaled precipitation anandhi et al 2011 fowler et al 2007 gooré bi et al 2017 hansen et al 2017 mpelasoka and chiew 2009 the constant factor is estimated as the difference or ratio of baseline precipitation and evaluation precipitation the constant scaling method is graphically depicted in fig 2 the initial step of constant scaling is to determine the mean monthly values of precipitation during the baseline and evaluation periods to estimate additive or multiplicative cf in specific from the daily precipitation series the monthly precipitation series is calculated from the monthly precipitation series the average monthly precipitation for each month is calculated the next step calculates additive or multiplicative change factors i e c f add and c f mul using eq 1 and eq 2 respectively 1 c f add p e p b 2 c f mul p e p b here p b and p e are the mean precipitation during baseline and evaluation periods respectively the downscaled precipitation values are determined by applying cf to the observed precipitation data using either eq 3 or eq 4 3 ls f add i o b s i c f add 4 ls f mul i o b s i c f mul where ls f add i and ls f mul i represent the downscaled values for additive and multiplicative cases respectively the observed precipitation data is denoted by ob s i at each time step i over the time period for example to obtain the downscaled daily precipitation value for january months in the evaluation period the change factor value of january month is added to or multiplied by the observed daily precipitation values of the baseline period as mentioned earlier there may arise a problem for the additive case due to negative precipitation which is eliminated by limiting the lower value to zero further when the observed historical precipitation is zero and the corresponding change factor is positive an artificial increase in the number of precipitation events arises in the additive cf methods hansen et al 2017 the artificial increase in the number of precipitation days is prevented by making the downscaled value zero when observed precipitation in the baseline period is zero 3 2 daily scaling the daily scaling method also called quantile quantile mapping chiew et al 2009 gooré bi et al 2017 mpelasoka and chiew 2009 willems and vrac 2011 similar to cs employs the observed historical daily precipitation series to obtain a future daily precipitation series the ds accounts for changes in the different precipitation percentiles in the daily precipitation series unlike the cs method which employs the same constant factor for all precipitation values occurs in a month fig 3 depicts the procedure for the daily scaling method in daily scaling the first step is to compute the empirical cumulative distribution function cdf of daily precipitation for both baseline and evaluation periods for cdf computation the daily precipitation values above 1 mm are used unlike cs the number of change factors in the daily scaling varies based on the number of divisions we make in the cdf for example we can divide the cdf into ten parts i e 10th 20th 100th percentile and calculate ten change factors or we can divide the cdf into 100 parts i e 1st 2nd 100th percentile and calculate 100 change factors since the study also tries to find the optimum number of change factors in the daily scaling a different possible number of change factors are considered in this study in specific daily scaling methods are evaluated with 100 20 10 6 5 4 3 2 and 1 change factors by dividing the cdf at each 1 5 10 15 20 25 30 50 and 100 percentiles respectively the cfs are calculated using eq 1 and eq 2 however instead of mean precipitation the percentile values are used to find the difference or ratio in eq 1 and eq 2 for example in the case of additive cf if the cdf is divided at every 25th percentile the first cf is obtained by taking the difference of the 25th percentile value in the baseline period and the 25th percentile value in the evaluation period similar to cs the downscaled simulated daily precipitation series is obtained using either eq 3 or eq 4 however the change factor is applied in the following way the cf found for xth percentile is added or multiplied to baseline precipitation which has an intensity greater than x 1 th percentile and less than or equal to xth percentile the percentiles are determined using the cdf of observed precipitation data for the baseline period 3 3 comparison of change factor methods since the manuscript aims to evaluate change factor methods in downscaling extreme precipitation change factor methods are evaluated in terms of their capability in downscaling extreme precipitation series for this different extreme precipitation series have to be extracted from both observed and simulated downscaled daily precipitation series the word extreme may refer to many different things in the climate literature and there is no unique climatological definition for it stephenson 2008 however in the case of precipitation an extreme can be reasonably well defined referring to the values in the tails of the distribution that would be expected to occur infrequently zhang and zwiers 2013 the am and pot are commonly used approaches to extract extreme quantiles therefore in this study the change factor methods are evaluated in simulating downscaling extreme precipitation series extracted with the am and pot methods for the pot method the threshold values are fixed at 90 pot90 92 5 pot92 5 95 pot95 and 97 5 pot97 5 percentile of observed daily precipitation values which are above 1 mm five extreme precipitation series i e one annual maximum series and four extreme precipitation series with pot method are extracted from both observed and simulated downscaled precipitation of evaluation period for each grid point since different extreme percentiles increase at different rates pendergrass 2018 wasko and sharma 2017 and the sample size may vary between observed and simulated downscaled pot series the extreme precipitation series are fitted with empirical cdf and 101 quantiles corresponding to 0 to 100th percentile in the cdf are used for the evaluation the performance of change factor methods is measured using root mean squared error rmse eq 5 in specific the performance indicator rmse is calculated between 101 quantiles of observed and simulated downscaled extreme precipitation series 5 rmse i 1 n x i x i 2 n where x i and x i indicate quantiles of observed precipitation and downscaled precipitation during evaluation period respectively n represents the sample size note that initially the change factor methods are evaluated with three performance indicators i e rmse coefficient of determination and nash sutcliffe efficiency however based on the average value for entire india the change factor methods are better differentiable with rmse than the other two performance indicators i e coefficient of determination and nash sutcliffe efficiency specifically since the manuscript presents the results for entire india the difference in the average value of other two error matrices i e coefficient of determination and nash sutcliffe efficiency is small between the change factor methods therefore the results based on the performance indicator rmse are presented in this manuscript however it is suggested to use multiple performance indicators if the aim is to compare change factor methods for a single a few precipitation station s 4 results and discussion to evaluate the change factor methods in downscaling extreme precipitation 80 variants refer table 2 of the four change factor methods namely acs ads mcs and mds are implemented for the study area i e 4948 imd grids over india as mentioned earlier five extreme precipitation series are extracted for each grid point from observed and downscaled simulated daily precipitation during the evaluation period using the annual maximum and pot methods the performance indicator rmse is calculated between observed and downscaled simulated extreme precipitation series the rmse between observed am series and am series extracted from the downscaled simulated precipitation series using cfm45 multiplicative daily scaling with 100 change factors and 20 years base period for all the 4948 grid points is shown in fig 4 a similarly the rmse between observed pot series and pot series extracted from the downscaled simulated precipitation series using cfm45 for all the 4948 grid points is shown in fig 4 b e as it is impossible to show similar plots for all 80 variants refer table 2 of change factor methods the average rmse for the entire india based on 4948 imd grids is calculated for all change factor methods reported in table 2 from table 2 it is seen that the cfm 7 multiplicative constant scaling with 30 years base period has the lowest average rmse between observed and downscaled simulated annual maximum extreme precipitation series over india similarly from table 2 it is seen that the cfm 62 multiplicative daily scaling with one change factor and 25 years base period is having the lowest average rmse between observed and downscaled simulated pot precipitation series extracted with all four threshold values i e pot90 pot92 5 pot95 and pot97 5 further cfm 6 multiplicative constant scaling with 25 years base period has the minimum average for all five extreme precipitation series rmse note that the best change factor method for an imd grid point could be different from the one which is having the lowest average rmse across india therefore each imd grid point s best change factor method is analyzed for all extreme precipitation series the cfm with the lowest rmse between observed and downscaled simulated extreme precipitation series is considered the best cfm for that extreme precipitation series of that grid point the best cfm for am series of each imd grid is shown in fig 5 a similarly the best cfm method for pot precipitation series extracted with all four threshold values i e pot90 pot92 5 pot95 and pot97 5 is shown in fig 5 b e the best cfm for all five extreme precipitation series is shown in fig 5 f from fig 5 among the 80 variants of cfm it is seen that the best cfm varies significantly with respect to grid point therefore to analyze the best change factor method among acs ads mcs and mds the 80 variants of cfm are broadly classified into these four groups and the best group for each imd grid point is analyzed the best change factor method group among acs ads mcs and mds for am series of each imd grid is shown in fig 6 a similarly the best change factor method group among acs ads mcs and mds for pot precipitation series extracted with all four threshold values i e pot90 pot92 5 pot95 and pot97 5 is shown in fig 6 b e the best change factor method group among acs ads mcs and mds for the all five extreme precipitation series is shown in fig 6 f on an average across five extreme precipitation series among acs ads mcs and mds the mds is the best change factor method for around 50 2465 out of 4948 of imd grids the next best change factor method groups are ads mcs and acs having a share of around 25 1245 out of 4948 24 1176 out of 4948 and 1 59 out of 4948 respectively in other words there exists a spatial dependency in the performance of change factor methods a bar chart of the number of grids for which the change factor method group acs ads mcs and mds is the best for different extreme precipitation series is plotted in fig 7 from fig 7 it is noted that the daily scaling methods ads and mds are the best change factor method for more than 75 of imd grids and the constant scaling methods acs and mcs are the best change factor method for less than 25 of imd grids in the case of constant scaling the number of change factors is constant in all variants of constant scaling cfms cfm1 to cfm8 however in the case of daily scaling the number of change factors varies with respect to the variant of daily scaling this leads to the question what should be the number of change factors in the daily scaling method to address the same the daily scaling methods ads and mds ranked as the best method for more than 75 of imd grids are grouped based on the number of change factors in the respective variant of daily scaling methods for example cfm9 cfm18 cfm27 cfm36 cfm45 cfm54 cfm63 and cfm72 are the different daily scaling variants with 100 change factors are grouped similarly different daily scaling variants are grouped with respect to the number of change factors in that variant the number of grids for which the groups of daily scaling method variants having the same number of change factors are the best for different extreme precipitation series is plotted in fig 8 from fig 8 it is clear that the variants of the daily scaling method having 100 change factors is dominating when compared to other variants of daily scaling method having a different number of change factors specifically on average the variants of the daily scaling method having 100 change factors are alone the best change factor method for 35 1708 out of 4948 of imd grids however from table 2 it is seen that the variants of the daily scaling method having 100 change factors cfm9 cfm18 cfm27 cfm36 cfm45 cfm54 cfm63 and cfm72 have a higher average across india rmse when compared to the variants of daily scaling method having a smaller number of change factors among the daily scaling variants the cfm71 has the lowest average across india rmse and has only one change factor calculated at the 100th percentile even all the constant scaling method variants have lesser average across india rmse compared to the variants of the daily scaling method having 100 change factors it indicates that though the variants of the daily scaling method having 100 change factors are alone the best change factor method for 35 of imd grids their performance is poor compared to other variants for the remaining grids this suggests that the change factor methods having 100 change factors may be overfitting the data it denotes that the change factor methods having a smaller number of change factors including constant scaling variants are better compared to variants of the daily scaling method having 100 change factors as the manuscript also tries to find the optimum size of the baseline period for downscaling extreme precipitation using change factor methods all the variants of change factor method groups acs ads mcs and mds are studied for different possible baseline periods 20 25 30 and 34 years to identify the best baseline period the best cfm of each grid point is grouped based on the baseline period used in the variant of the cfm for all extreme precipitation series the spatial variation of the best baseline period for am series is shown in fig 9 a similarly the spatial variation of the best baseline period for pot precipitation series extracted with all four threshold values i e pot90 pot92 5 pot95 and pot97 5 is shown in fig 9 b e the spatial variation of the best baseline period for all five extreme precipitation series is shown in fig 9 f a bar chart of the number of grids for which the particular baseline period is the best for different extreme precipitation series is plotted in fig 10 from figs 9 and 10 it is noted that each one of the four baseline periods chosen for the study is found to be the best baseline period for more than 20 on an average of imd grids it suggests that the study area is not sensitive to the baseline period however the baseline periods 20 years and 34 years are having a slightly higher share when compared to the other two baseline periods 5 summary and conclusions we evaluated the different variants of the change factor method in downscaling extreme precipitation over india daily precipitation series over india from 68 years 1952 2019 of india meteorological department s high resolution gridded 0 25 longitude 0 25 latitude daily precipitation dataset comprises of 4948 grid points are used to evaluate the change factor methods the total time period is divided into baseline period and evaluation period based on the size of the baseline period used in the change factor method variant four baseline periods i e 20 25 30 and 34 years are considered in this study a total of 80 variants of four change factor methods namely acs ads mcs and mds are formulated by varying the size of the baseline period and the number of change factors in the daily scaling method for each imd grid point all 80 variants of the change factor method are applied to downscale the daily precipitation during evaluation period change factor methods are evaluated in terms of their capability in downscaling the annual maximum precipitation series and four extreme precipitation series corresponding to four threshold values i e pot90 pot92 5 pot95 and pot97 5 extracted with pot method the performance indicator rmse is calculated between observed and downscaled simulated extreme precipitation series in the evaluation periods the cfm with the lowest rmse between observed and downscaled simulated extreme precipitation series is considered the best cfm for that extreme precipitation series of that grid point the results indicate that the mds is the best change factor method for around 50 2465 out of 4948 of imd grids the next best change factor method groups are ads mcs and acs having a share of around 25 1245 out of 4948 24 1176 out of 4948 and 1 59 out of 4948 respectively note that the daily scaling methods ads and mds are the best change factor method for more than 75 of imd grids and the constant scaling methods acs and mcs are the best change factor method for less than 25 of imd grids it is also found that the variants of the daily scaling method having 100 change factors are dominating when compared to other variants of daily scaling having a different number of change factors specifically on average the variants of the daily scaling method having 100 change factors are alone the best change factor method for 35 1708 out of 4948 of imd grids though the variants of the daily scaling method having 100 change factors are alone the best change factor method for 35 of imd grids their performance is poor compared to other variants for the remaining grids it indicates that the change factor methods having a smaller number of change factors including constant scaling variants are consistent compared to the variants of the daily scaling method having 100 change factors furthermore all four baseline periods chosen for the study are found to best baseline period for more than 20 on an average of imd grids however the baseline periods 20 years and 34 years are having a slightly higher share when compared to the other two baseline periods note that this manuscript evaluates the different variants of the change factor methods in downscaling extreme precipitation over india however the readers are recommended to note the limitations of the change factor methods for the appropriate usage for example one of the main limitations of change factor methods is the persistence of the same number of rainy days in the future projections when the historical climate data is used as the baseline graham et al 2007 hansen et al 2017 further diaz nieto and wilby 2005 reported that the change factor methods might not be useful for studying the impacts of event frequency and changes in temporal sequencing in this study as we try to have a holistic evaluation of change factor methods in downscaling extreme precipitation all the variants of change factor methods including additive variants are evaluated in downscaling extreme precipitation over india however additive variants of change factor methods are considered a poor choice for precipitation and multiplicative variants of change factor methods are recommended for precipitation switanek et al 2017 the same is observed from our study results i e the additive variants of change factor methods performed better only for a few grids over india therefore it is suggested to use the multiplicative variants of change factor methods for downscaling precipitation

2833,recently gridded precipitation datasets gpds have become an essential input in hydrological modeling evaluation of their performance is a priori step before their application when they are applied to a glaciated catchment the glacier mass balance adds another dimension to the evaluation this study has attempted to introduce the turc budyko formula for validating the gpds in glaciated catchments this approach can identify the over or under estimation of catchment precipitation input by the gpds as a case study the approach was applied in upper indus basin uib located in high mountain asia the turc budyko formula and other commonly used evaluation techniques found that aphrodite underestimated the precipitation by 40 although it captured most of inter and intra annual variations of local climatology cc 0 6 cfsr and har were overestimated 106 and 77 and characterize uib as leaky catchment whereas underestimated gpds characterize uib as gaining catchment in leaky conditions glacier storage changes were positive 0 21 0 37 m w e yr 1 while gaining conditions made negative glacier storage changes 0 44 to 0 34 m w e yr 1 in uib none of the gpds represented true conditions of glacio hydrology in uib introducing the turc budyko formula confirmed that direct application of gpds in hydrological modeling is implausible because gpds generally cannot produce rational output of streamflow and mass balance simultaneously it is recommended to locally correct the gpds before any hydrological application in glacierized catchments keywords gridded precipitation

introduction hydrological simulation is almost inevitably used to develop policies and pro actively remediate and mitigate the challenges caused by climate change and its impacts on river basins nowadays immerzeel et al 2020 pritchard 2019 the uncertainties in the hydrological simulation results may affect the understanding and management strategies of the water resources and so the millions of people who are dependent on these resources for hydropower generation domestic industrial and agricultural needs as well as to maintain the ecological systems huss and hock 2018 luo et al 2018 singh et al 2016 viviroli et al 2007 precipitation is the primary input to the hydrological models and the availability of accurate precipitation data is the prerequisite for efficient and reliable simulation results in any catchment koutsouris et al 2016 tong et al 2014 meanwhile it is a fact that observed precipitation data are usually insufficient or even unavailable for effective hydrological simulation especially in the high elevation zones where glaciers exist fortunately scientists have developed gridded precipitation datasets gpds using observed reanalysis or remote sensing data or a combination of them to overcome the problem of data scarcity and distribution biasness dee et al 2011 harris et al 2014 huffman and bolvin 2015 maussion et al 2014 saha et al 2010 yatagai et al 2012 these datasets provide continuous land coverage usually spanning from the 1960s to the present day with daily time steps and thus provide an opportunity for driving the hydrological simulation in the data scarce watersheds however the accuracy of gpds is uncertain due to their development methods sources and spatiotemporal resolution the reliability of these datasets is limited by total number of gauges spatial distribution and coverage data assimilation models and satellite algorithms ehsani and behrangi 2022 kidd et al 2017 pollock et al 2018 sun et al 2018 there are three primary types of gpds based sources and methods gauges based remote sensing and reanalysis datasets each kind of dataset has its advantages and limitations the gauge based observed precipitation is comparatively accurate it is often used as a reference to develop calibrate and evaluate other precipitation datasets the gauge characteristics e g windshield type height size shape and material also affect the accuracy of observations bogart and legates 2009 ehsani and behrangi 2022 sun et al 2018 the meteorological stations are sparse kidd et al 2017 and unevenly distributed in mountain regions most located at low elevations ji et al 2020 salio et al 2015 woldemeskel et al 2013 which induces bias in representing the catchment scale precipitation in mountainous glacierized regions immerzeel et al 2015 wortmann et al 2018 the gauge based gpds cannot be used for real time applications due to their latency and coarser temporal resolution kidd et al 2017 le coz et al 2021 furthermore the extreme values got smoother during interpolation for generating gpds affecting long term trends in regions with low density gauge networks hegerl et al 2015 sun et al 2018 trenberth et al 2017 overall gauge based precipitation is inconsistent between gpds and varies considerably from region to region in contrast remote sensing based gpds have finer spatial resolution and can present accurate precipitation in un gauged regions due to their broader coverage ehsani et al 2022 however they are less sensitive to snowfall and light rain and cannot capture the precipitation over ice and snow adhikari et al 2020 cao and liang 2018 liu et al 2019b the performance of remote sensing based datasets is also restricted under cloud covered conditions kidd et al 2012 and in representing the orographic precipitation processes in mountainous regions shige et al 2013 the satellite precipitation estimates are indirect and can induce significant variability in derived gpds ehsani et al 2021 additionally it is challenging to use satellite based gpds data for long term hydro climatic applications because of their shorter temporal coverage at the same time the reanalysis gpds generally provide more extended temporal coverage which makes them suitable for long term hydro climatic applications saha et al 2010 sheffield et al 2006 sun et al 2018 however source specific assessments showed that reanalysis datasets failed to represent many weather patterns bosilovich et al 2008 in addition reanalysis datasets had a greater degree of variability than the other types of datasets the inherent issues in all types of gpds sun et al 2018 yao et al 2020 make the selection of an appropriate input dataset very challenging for specific hydrological applications therefore priori evaluation of gpds is necessary to ensure whether they represent the local characteristics of hydrometeorology evaluation of the gpds is complicated in glacierized watersheds because of glacier involvement i e mass gain from the precipitation accumulation and mass loss due to melt release that becomes additional water input to streamflow shafeeque et al 2019 arguments arise when only observed rain gauge data are used to evaluate gpds ali et al 2017 anjum et al 2018 blacutt et al 2015 henn et al 2018 hu and chen 2018 hu et al 2016 hussain et al 2017 romilly and gebremichael 2011 because observation data might have been used in generating specific gpds in this case the data from corresponding grid cells may match the rain gauge data very well for some gpds but may fail with the others the differences in observation timing among different regional gauge networks create unlabeled multiday aggregations mekonnen et al 2021 sun et al 2014 that cause such discrepancies for different gpds on the other hand evaluation using rain gauge data cannot be performed in the high elevation zones where the rain gauges suffer from gauge undercatch issues due to wind pollock et al 2018 evaporation ehsani and behrangi 2022 and sublimation fassnacht 2004 or in some cases the data is just unavailable winiger et al 2005 in fact the station observations cannot capture the strong vertical gradients immerzeel et al 2015 because multiple local factors in mountainous regions make it difficult to analyze and understand the spatiotemporal variations in complex hydro climatic regimes lutz et al 2014 using the available gpds to drive the hydrological simulation is another way of evaluating them in both temporal spatial distributions and water balance tong et al 2014 the detailed hydrological simulation outputs can provide rich information for evaluating the gpds and diagnosing potential problems yet the most complicated task due to extensive data and model parameterization ragettli and pellicciotti 2012 therefore previous studies generally ignore the glacier involvement in their analysis data scarcity in the glacierized regions changes in glacier storage and glacial melt as an additional input to streamflow wang et al 2018 together make the hydrological behavior intricate it is noteworthy that ability of gpds to represent the rationality of glacier and hydrological outputs have never been assessed before in precipitation datasets validation studies on a watershed and annual scale a hydrological alternative of the turc budyko theory budyko 1974 turc 1954 represents water and energy balance coron et al 2015 valéry et al 2010 it connects the annual streamflow to the precipitation and evapotranspiration in a formula and provides a simple method to evaluate the annual precipitation by the observed streamflow it is usually applied with the assumption that the annual change in watershed storage is neglected andréassian and perrin 2012 however the relationship among precipitation evapotranspiration and streamflow goes beyond the abovementioned principles if glacier storage variates and meltwater contribute to streamflow glacial storage change can be detected by the turc budyko theory provided that glacial storage changes have been involved in the water balance shafeeque and luo 2021 thus applying the turc budyko theory is the most straightforward technique to estimate the change in glacial storage meanwhile the representation of local climatology and rationality of glacio hydrological outputs are also necessary for confirming the validity of a gpd in glacierized river basins therefore the potential problems of gpds and the involvement of glaciers can thus be detected by combining statistical validation physical diagnosis based on the turc budyko formula and glacio hydrological modeling the paper s main objective was to introduce the turc budyko formula in evaluating the gpds in glacierized catchments the proposed validation approach helps answer whether gpds can directly be applied in hydrological modeling studies in glacierized mountain regions to represent rational glacio hydrological behavior the proposed validation approach was applied as a case study in the highly glacierized upper indus basin uib located in high mountain asia 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area upper indus basin uib is located in high mountain asia and is covered by extensive glaciers 31 37 n and 72 82 e it covers 173 000 km2 and is distributed among china india and pakistan uib hosts the eastern hindukush western himalayas and karakoram mountain ranges inman 2010 khan et al 2015 mukhopadhyay and khan 2014 westerlies and summer monsoon precipitation systems fig 1 a are responsible for the annual precipitation in uib however the effect and contributions of both sources differ temporally and spatially the total number of glaciers is about 12 000 in uib covering 15 000 km2 with a glacier area ratio gar of about 12 bajracharya and shrestha 2011 the snow cover varies seasonally in uib with maximum snow in spring and a minimum in summer gurung et al 2017 the percent of snow covered area of uib ranges from 10 to 70 hasson et al 2014 uib was divided into three sub regions himalaya hmla hindukush hndksh and karakorum krkrm fig 1b to account for the influence of multiple climatic systems and unique interactions among the cryosphere atmosphere and hydrosphere 2 2 data table 1 briefly describes the sources of hydrology climate soil land use dem glacier mass balance and gpds data used in the study further details on these data are provided in the supplementary material 2 3 precipitation adjustment accurate precipitation estimates are pivotal for climate research studies and glacio hydrological modeling applications kidd et al 2012 shafeeque and luo 2021 however observed precipitation is underestimated immerzeel et al 2015 wortmann et al 2018 due to biased vertical distribution of gauges kidd et al 2017 winiger et al 2005 and higher gauge undercatch for solid precipitation ehsani and behrangi 2022 hirabayashi et al 2008 jimeno sáez et al 2020 previous studies suggest that further efforts are needed to reduce gauge undercatch errors pollock et al 2018 by installing more accurate gauges e g disdrometer and radars sun et al 2018 and developing improved methods to correct their undercatch ehsani and behrangi 2022 in the current study observed precipitation was adjusted for the selected stations based on the corrected precipitation in dahri et al 2018 the spatial fields for adjusted observed precipitation obs were generated by interpolating and resampling the point observations fig 1d for comparison with gpds which were also resampled at a common resolution of 0 25 0 25 using a simple resampling technique nearest neighbor the average annual adjusted precipitation was 540 180 mm yr 1 36 higher than the uncorrected during 1951 2017 in uib fig 1e 2 4 validation approach we introduce the turc budyko formula to validate the water energy mass balance of a glaciated catchment in addition we also adopt the commonly used technique such as statistical performance evaluation of gpds against obs for investigating the ability of gpds to represent the local climatology and practical simulation using glacio hydrological models to investigate the rationality of simulated hydrology and glacier changes a schematic diagram of the validation approach is provided in fig 2 incorporating physical diagnosis based on water energy mass balance is the most important contribution to the proposed validation approach the physical diagnosis was performed to identify the actual over and under estimation of the gpds at watershed scale based on the water energy mass balance a hydrological alternative of the turc budyko plot andréassian and perrin 2012 was used to diagnose the gpds for reproducing a plausible water energy balance the most widely used type of representation is proposed by turc 1954 and budyko 1974 finally the water balance equation of a glacierized catchment was used to estimate the change in glacier storage i e mass balance for each dataset this method tests the realistic closure of the water energy balance using precipitation from each dataset long term water yield or runoff coefficient q p was plotted as a function of long term aridity index p etp coron et al 2015 valéry et al 2010 i e 1 q p f p e t p 2 p q α et p w h e r e α 1 where q mm yr 1 p mm yr 1 and etp mm yr 1 represent specific runoff precipitation and evapotranspiration in a catchment respectively plotting the aridity index on the x axis also allows focusing on the wettest and driest catchments based on input precipitation wetter catchment corresponds to a higher p etp value the physical interpretation of this hydrological representation is based on three assumptions 1 q 0 2 q p etp and 3 q p fig 2 in glacierized catchments the simplest water balance equation can be written as 3 δ s δ t p q et a m b where eta mm yr 1 and mb mm w e yr 1 represent actual evapotranspiration and mass balance in the watershed respectively the imbalance in eq 3 is storage change δs the groundwater percolation is compensated by baseflow over multiple years as considered by immerzeel et al 2015 therefore it does not pose a significant impact on overall balance thus all changes in storage are considered as mass balance when δs 0 the catchment is a perfect true catchment meanwhile a true catchment can have a slight positive or negative change in storage depending on the quality of observed mass balance and eta the gaining catchments always have a negative change in storage δs 0 and the leaky catchments always have positive changes in storage δs 0 the negative change in storage results in the melting of glaciers and contributes additional water to total runoff in contrast positive change in storage represents advancing glaciers in a catchment where heavy precipitation falls in solid form and is stored as glaciers the glacio hydrological modeling was included in the validation approach to ensure whether gpds can simultaneously produce balanced outputs of streamflow and glacier changes the observed glacier modis snow cover and hydrology data were used to calibrate the glacio hydrological model details in supplementary material and then the simulated results of runoff and mass balance are analyzed for rationality in a glacierized catchment the spatial processes in hydrology sphy model terink et al 2015 was used for the practical validation of the ability of all the precipitation datasets to simulate rational hydrology and glacier changes six sphy projects were set up for each precipitation dataset i e sphy obs sphy aphrodite sphy cfsr sphy har sphy pgmfd and sphy imerg the detailed calibration and validation for these sphy projects are described in the supplementary material 3 results 3 1 statistical validation based on climatology the amount of precipitation in cfsr and har was overestimated compared to obs in uib average annual precipitation was found as 323 99 to 1115 419 mm yr 1 for gpds smallest for aphrodite and greatest for cfsr over varying periods from 1951 to 2017 respectively fig 3 a the correlation coefficient cc for cfsr was the lowest 0 2 whereas its value of bias 106 was the highest in uib table 2 the performance of har to represent the inter annual variations of obs was unsatisfactory due to higher bias 77 and lower correlation cc 0 3 the performance of aphrodite to represent the pattern of annual variations was better identified in uib with a higher correlation cc 0 6 followed by imerg and pgmfd fig 3g however annual aphrodite precipitation was underestimated by 40 in uib table 2 the most part 61 of annual obs occurred in the winter and spring season in uib fig 3c averagely the winter and spring season precipitation was overestimated by cfsr and har by 133 and 116 respectively whereas it was underestimated by aphrodite 47 pgmfd 29 and imerg 41 3 2 physical validation based on the water energy mass balance the physical realism of gpds was tested by identifying the glacier involvement in the water balance literature and remote sensing mass balance data were used for comparison purposes the overall change in water storage based on grace data was 0 15 m w e yr 1 fig 4 which matched the observed δs 0 17 m w e yr 1 used in water energy and mass balance calculations for each selected gpd the uib was characterized as true gaining and leaky catchment in the gaining catchments which break the water limit q p additional water is added to the water balance which is contributed by glacier melt in the glacierized catchments such catchment behavior results in a negative change in glacier storage δs 0 for example in the hmla sub region all the datasets were gaining and meltwater contributed to the total runoff fig 4a on the other hand in the leaky catchments which break the energy limit q p etp some quantity of water is missing from the expected water balance cfsr and har were identified to make the study area extremely wet based on the aridity index values fig 4a however the observed water balance was less than the expected water balance this missing water was stored in the form of positive glacier storage δs 0 cfsr and har made hindukush and karakorum sub regions and the entire uib domain leaky where missing water from the water balance results in advancing glaciers the δs based on all datasets ranged between 0 44 to 0 37 m w e y 1 fig 4c the etp values used in the hydrological alternative of the turc budyko plot may have a slight effect on the results therefore we performed uncertainty analysis to highlight the extent of the variations caused by variations in etp values a slight increase 0 03 0 01 m w e yr 1 in the estimated mass balance was noted with decreasing etp and vice versa 0 02 0 01 m w e yr 1 in uib fig 5 a the krkrm region did not show any significant effect of variations in etp values on mass balance fig 5a higher etp reduced the aridity index by 0 20 0 12 and moved the catchments towards drier conditions in the hydrological plot fig 5b contrary smaller etp moved catchments towards wetter conditions by increasing the aridity index 0 12 0 05 all the subregions were less sensitive to increasing etp values than decreasing values fig 5b meanwhile hmla subregion responded with lesser sensitivity to the decreasing etp than other subregions fig 5b the observed precipitation was adjusted before using it in evaluation because it was not representing the realistic water and mass balance in uib fig 5c d highlights the sensitivity of results to the observed precipitation adjustment in uib all gpds showed higher cc with corrected precipitation except har which had higher cc with uncorrected precipitation fig 5c in the krkrm subregion the centered rmse and sd were higher in case of corrected precipitation for aphrodite pgmfd and imerg however cc was not affected significantly in the hndksh subregion pgmfd showed a decrease in cc whereas aphrodite correlation was increased in the case of uncorrected precipitation fig 5c the calculated storage changes based on uncorrected observed precipitation were unrealistic compared to the actual situation in uib in the case of uncorrected precipitation the storage changes were 43 32 136 and 108 more negative in hmla hndksh krkrm and uib respectively fig 5d higher glacier involvement in hydrology will translate into higher uncertainty when used uncorrected precipitation for gpd evaluation in glacierized regions such a high difference compared to the realistic conditions would cause significant uncertainty in evaluating gpds overall the precipitation adjustment improved the evaluation results in highly glacierized uib 3 3 rational hydrology and glacier changes the sphy model was calibrated and validated using the snow cover mass balance and streamflow data in uib a rationality technique in which one of the two variables mass balance and streamflow was kept constant to avoid the risk of equifinality was used due to the glacier compensation effect lang 1986 we focused on fixing the average annual mass balance in uib the simulated mass balance by sphy obs sphy aphrodite sphy cfsr sphy har sphy pgmfd and sphy imerg was 0 17 σ where σ 0 10 0 48 m w e y 1 for 2002 2007 respectively fig 6 e the simulated annual runoff 263 23 to 743 71 mm yr 1 was underestimated for all datasets except cfsr and har from 2002 to 2007 fig 6a the pbias of annual runoff for gpds compared to observed data was between 41 underestimated by 33 8 and 69 60 9 for the sphy projects the highest positive pbias was noted for sphy cfsr followed by sphy har in contrast the maximum negative pbias was noticed for the sphy aphrodite project fig 6d the results highlighted that the simulated runoff broke the rationality of glacio hydrological outputs when the simulated mass balance was calibrated with reference mass balance in the basin in uib the total runoff was contributed first by snow runoff in the late spring to early summer and then glacier runoff started contributing to generate maximum flows in summer fig 7 a baseflow joined the total runoff having a recession of more than three and a half months recession days 110 supplementary table s4 after percolation during the melting season on annual scale the glacier snow baseflow and rainfall runoff contributed to total runoff ranging between 44 and 49 30 35 14 20 and 3 5 respectively fig 7a the spatial distribution of total runoff and its components simulated under sphy projects confirmed that the underestimated gpds produced underestimated runoff and vice versa the snow runoff contributions were relatively higher from the hndksh and western parts of the hmla subregion in contrast glacier runoff was contributed by the krkrm subregion fig 7b meanwhile the differences in snowmelt and glacier melt components were higher for different gpds especially in the karakorum sub region these datasets were ranked as aphrodite imerg pgmfd cfsr har based on the overall performance of selected gpds gpds must be corrected to represent local characteristics before being used for further hydrological modeling applications 4 discussions 4 1 representation of local climatology performance evaluation of gpds in representing observed climatology would be beneficial for assessing the expected uncertainties in simulated glacio hydrologic outputs the spatial and temporal distribution of mean annual gpds precipitation shows diverse differences in magnitudes and patterns compared with obs fig 3 aphrodite performed better in representing the patterns in interannual variations cc 0 6 fig 3g however annual precipitation was highly underestimated 40 table 2 the winter and spring precipitation was underestimated in aphrodite 47 imerg 41 and pgmfd 29 whereas it was overestimated in cfsr 133 and har 116 fig 3c most winter and spring precipitation falling in solid form at higher altitudes is underrepresented in most gpds the statistical evaluation indicated that these gpds would cause under or over estimations in simulated glacio hydrological outputs the reliability of statistical approaches in evaluating gpds and the extent of expected uncertainties in hydrological simulations might have low confidence the reasons for such low confidence include observed data that is unevenly distributed insufficient or missing especially at higher elevations some of the data have already been used to generate gpds additionally the runoff peak is significantly different from lags behind the precipitation peak fig 3b although these approaches have been applied in multiple previous studies to evaluate the performance of gpds ali et al 2017 anjum et al 2018 blacutt et al 2015 henn et al 2018 hu and chen 2018 hu et al 2016 hussain et al 2017 romilly and gebremichael 2011 however the authenticity of such statistical evaluation is questionable when the observed data is insufficient or of inferior quality due to the uneven distribution of meteorological stations which is the case in high elevation glacierized river basins moreover observed data have been used in generating or calibrating gpds in one or the other forms dee et al 2011 harris et al 2014 huffman and bolvin 2015 maussion et al 2014 saha et al 2010 yatagai et al 2012 which cause pseudo high performance in grid cells covering observation stations in uib the observed precipitation does not represent the true conditions due to multiple factors including low elevation stations immerzeel et al 2015 complex topography and multiple precipitation systems hasson et al 2017 correcting the precipitation before applying it for such performance evaluations is necessary in the current study the observed precipitation data were adjusted using the corrected precipitation in uib the adjusted precipitation was 36 greater than the uncorrected precipitation fig 1 while using the corrected precipitation as a reference the reanalysis dataset i e cfsr and model based downscaled dataset i e har show overestimation in all the sub regions in contrast the observation based dataset i e aphrodite satellite based dataset i e imerg and reanalysis and observation combined dataset i e pgmfd show underestimations different researchers made similar concluding remarks for reanalysis interpolated and satellite based datasets dahri et al 2016 ji et al 2020 liu et al 2019a liu et al 2018 yao et al 2020 the reanalysis datasets account for both solid and liquid precipitation more consistently which may explain their overestimation in high mountain glacierized regions blacutt et al 2015 however observation interpolated and satellite estimations based datasets have difficulty in detecting the snowfall ehsani and behrangi 2022 rasmussen et al 2012 wang et al 2013 it is important to note that interpolation of gauge observations to generate gpds smooths the extreme values and introduces fake trends and variability into reanalysis outputs bengtsson 2004 hegerl et al 2015 sun et al 2018 trenberth et al 2017 therefore trends and magnitude variabilities from gpds should be treated carefully for hydrological applications although gpds have captured the monthly distribution patterns of obs precipitation these datasets show significant differences in their monthly seasonal and annual magnitudes mismatch in the timing of gauge observations undercatched solid precipitation and precipitation intermittency can cause discrepancies among the gpds ehsani and behrangi 2022 ehsani et al 2021 mekonnen et al 2021 trenberth et al 2017 moreover the large under and over estimations for the gpds over elevational profiles may have been caused by the dynamic climatic system pang et al 2014 precipitation dependency on altitude immerzeel et al 2015 wortmann et al 2018 and the approaches used to generate these datasets harris et al 2014 huffman et al 2010 saha et al 2010 the reason for the better representation of obs climatology by the aphrodite dataset is the use of observed data in its generation however the precipitation at ungauged elevation ranges is not extrapolated in the aphrodite dataset ji et al 2020 yatagai et al 2012 which would affect its direct application in mountain glacierized catchments glaciers contribute significantly to annual runoff fig 7a and the peak of hydrographs lags almost three months from the peak of hyetographs fig 3b in uib in addition to the inherited pros and cons of gpds and complexities in reference data for evaluation the involvement of glaciers highlights that a simple statistical approach alone cannot answer whether gpds can directly be applied in hydrological simulations of glacierized river basins 4 2 representation of water energy mass balance introducing the turc budyko formula into the validation approach helps identify the actual under or over estimation of gpds based on watershed water energy mass balance diagnosing their possible causes and providing directions for local correction in glacierized river basins the physical diagnosis component in the validation approach also helps detect the possible effects of meltwater on the changes in glacier storage based on the water energy mass balance the problems in gpds can be diagnosed by analyzing the physical factors involved in these effects the physical diagnosis identifies the true gaining and leaky catchments based on the water input into the catchment uib was identified as gaining catchment based on aphrodite pgmfd and imerg whereas it was leaky based on cfsr and har fig 4a there are three possible reasons for the case of gaining catchment a additional water contribution from glacier melt characterized by a negative change in glacier storage which is the case in uib immerzeel et al 2015 b underestimated precipitation valéry et al 2010 which is true for aphrodite 40 pgmfd 24 and imerg 43 table 2 and c errors in runoff measurements andréassian and perrin 2012 underestimation of precipitation and additional water term in water balance is evident from previous studies in uib dahri et al 2016 immerzeel et al 2015 lutz et al 2014 similarly rasmussen et al 2012 found that the chances of snow under catch might be as high as 20 50 in high altitude mountainous areas which is the case in uib especially in the hindukush and karakorum sub regions the possibility of runoff measurement errors has also been warned in different studies in the region mukhopadhyay and khan 2014 on the other hand for the leaky catchments there might be four reasons in addition to discharge measurement errors underestimation a errors in the estimation of etp underestimation b overestimated precipitation which is the case for cfsr 106 and har 77 table 2 c higher infiltration or local aquifer recharge or d underground water flow towards another aquifer andréassian and perrin 2012 the impact of inter catchment groundwater flow on the behavior of leaky catchments has been analyzed in france by le moine et al 2007 who suggested that underground water affects the overall water balance however in uib the overestimation of precipitation in these datasets is the most probable reason for leaky catchment behavior under cfsr and har the bed is rocky and vegetation is very low in uib such conditions strengthening the conclusion of overestimated cfsr and har precipitation several researchers blacutt et al 2015 liu et al 2018 silva et al 2011 have provided evidence for overestimated cfsr precipitation in different parts of the world in the hydrological alternative of turc budyko plot the water limit helps identify the additional water term in the water balance or missing water input aphrodite imerg and pgmfd are out of water limit fig 4a and the missing precipitation in these datasets may be due to the undercatched and undetected solid precipitation at higher elevations adhikari et al 2020 ehsani and behrangi 2022 ehsani et al 2021 pollock et al 2018 rasmussen et al 2012 if such datasets were used in hydrological simulations they would result in a highly negative mass balance long term and simulate implausible conditions in the glacierized catchment these datasets are insufficient to close the realistic water energy mass balance in glacierized regions higher negative storage change values up to 0 44 m w e yr 1 prove this claim fig 4c on the other hand cfsr and har are mostly out of energy limit and the overestimated water input will result in higher positive storage change 0 37 m w e yr 1 and it may simulate implausible positive mass balance conditions in glacio hydrological modeling the physical diagnosis of gpds in uib indicates that gpds may not reproduce the true water balance and most of them might be unsuitable for hydrological applications in such glacierized catchments similar concerns were highlighted by dahri et al 2016 who performed an evaluation of gpds and their unsuitability to force the hydrological models in uib the above discussion suggests that the direct application of gpds in hydrological simulations would be inefficient the difference between the actual and estimated mass balance for each dataset helps derive the correction factors for adjusting the magnitude of precipitation in gpds 4 3 rationality of simulated hydrology and glacier changes the practical simulation component in the proposed validation approach ensures the ability of a gpd to represent the balanced outputs of glacier processes and streamflow simultaneously when the gpds are underestimated for example aphrodite imerg and pgmfd table 2 they are insufficient to reproduce the hydrology and mass balance at the same time fig 6 adjusting one of them during the calibration process would cause underestimations in the other in simulated results when the gpds are overestimated for example cfsr and har may overestimate at least one of the simulated streamflow or glacier mass balance fig 6 the inferences are reliable because we dealt with the glacier compensation effect lang 1986 during the calibration and re tuning of the sphy projects the differences in simulated runoff magnitudes are the actual reflections of the differences in precipitation magnitudes for gpds similar percent contributions from runoff components to total annual runoff fig 7a prove that the glacier compensation effect was eliminated effectively otherwise the underestimated precipitation may be compensated with other water balance components e g evapotranspiration snow or glacier melt ragettli and pellicciotti 2012 schaefli 2005 shafeeque et al 2019 a false calibration parameter set would enhance the simulated meltwater to reduce the bias between simulated and observed runoff ragettli and pellicciotti 2012 wang et al 2018 for example in the case of the sphy model forced by aphrodite pgmfd and imerg precipitation datasets to enhance the simulated runoff a higher negative mass balance would result however keeping the average mass balance closer to observed mass balance data fig 6e eliminated such risk of uncertainty hence the uncertainties in the simulated outputs of glacio hydrological applications can be identified using the validation approach based on the quantitative results of the current study it is concluded that gpds generally cannot reproduce the rational output of glacier changes and hydrology in glacierized catchments thus gpds cannot be applied directly in hydrological simulations in such regions therefore correcting the gpds using local physical characteristics such as mass and water balance is recommended before any hydrological application in glacierized catchments seasonal distribution of runoff components helps derive the correction factors for seasonal adjustments of gpds precipitation combined with observed local climatology the spatiotemporal information on snowfall and meltwater distributions during winter and summer would be useful to derive correction factors for a precise correction 4 4 limitations and implications the use of non dimensional hydrological representation is suitable and advantageous because physical data like runoff evapotranspiration and precipitation are frequently measured or calculated in any watershed andréassian and perrin 2012 however the methods applied to calculate etp may affect the overall representation of the hydrological alternative of the turc budyko plot fig 5 coron et al 2015 argued that the energy limit might also depend on the chosen etp formula in the current study we used hargreaves s method hargreaves and samani 1985 which may ignore most climatic parameters and use only temperature data the variations in calculated etp did not cause many variations in estimated mass balance and water energy limits fig 5 that can significantly affect the overall results in our case study additionally precipitation adjustment positively impacted the overall evaluation results fig 5c d apparently the number of selected gpds five datasets looks small however they represent all categories of gpds and serve the purpose of demonstration in our case study as gpds have differences in their spatiotemporal resolutions covered time and underlying methodologies sun et al 2018 the gpds based on various sources and different methods were selected for analysis in this study i e reanalysis cfsr observed interpolation aphrodite the combination of reanalysis and observed interpolations pgmfd satellite observations imerg and downscaled model output har the case study validation with a limited number of gpds is only for demonstration purposes meanwhile the proposed validation approach can be used for any gpds and applies in any mountain glacier region it is essential to highlight that most datasets are not independent of each other as most of them include the same station observations directly or assimilate them somehow however this connection among gpds is a common problem in comparison studies which cannot be avoided the understandings developed using the proposed validation approach are also effective for the data generators and algorithm developers to improve their work keeping in mind the application demands for real time scenarios the actual under or over estimation identified in physical diagnosis can be used to derive correction factors for adjusting the magnitude of annual precipitation in gpds meanwhile seasonal distributions of snowfall and meltwater identified in glacio hydrological modeling combined with observed local climatology can be used to derive correction factors for seasonal corrections of gpds it is important to highlight that adding more explanatory variables would improve the selection of gpds for hydrological modeling applications however adding more explanatory variables requires more data and computations to assess the related uncertainties ragettli and pellicciotti 2012 in lack of sufficient data and complexities in glacier simulation schemes might also increase the overall uncertainty marzeion et al 2020 rounce et al 2020 on one hand adding more explanatory variables might improve the evaluation results with expensive observed data and computation capacity pellicciotti et al 2012 on the other hand there is a likely risk of increasing uncertainties due to insufficient parametrization calibration or validation under complex conditions ragettli et al 2013 in any case the spatiotemporal scope of their application would be limited sufficient data and appropriate computational capacity are prerequisites for recommending the inclusion of more variables in evaluation approaches 5 conclusions involving the turc budyko formula in evaluating the gpds helps determine whether the direct application of gpds in hydrological modeling is plausible in glacierized mountain regions where glacier involvement complicates the hydrology this study quantitatively investigated representative gpds from different categories proposing an advanced validation approach a sequential combination of statistical validation physical diagnosis based on the turc budyko formula and practical application in glacio hydrological simulations the statistical validation identifies the potential problems in the spatiotemporal distribution of the datasets e g aphrodite represents the monthly and seasonal distributions and interannual variations cc 0 6 but was underestimated on the other hand cfsr and har were overestimated and did not represent the inter annual variations in uib cc 0 3 reanalysis based gpds are generally overestimated 77 106 whereas observation and satellite based gpds were underestimated 43 to 24 the underestimated gpds would result in an underestimated hydrology when applied in glacio hydrological simulations the physical diagnosis based on the turc budyko formula identifies that aphrodite imerg and pgmfd datasets make the catchments gaining indicating an additional water source in water balance due to glacier melting results in negative glacier storage 0 44 to 0 34 m w e yr 1 on the other hand cfsr and har make the catchments leaky highlighting a positive change in glacier storage 0 37 and 0 21 m w e yr 1 respectively the actual under and over estimation based on physical diagnosis provides the basic directions for local corrections in magnitudes of gpds in glacierized mountain regions the gaining catchments characterized by underestimated precipitation need more input water higher precipitation to sustain water and mass balance concurrently whereas leaky catchments characterized by overestimated precipitation need lesser input water to reproduce the plausible water energy and mass balance in a glacierized catchment simultaneously the gpds generally cannot concurrently fulfill the requirements of the rational output of streamflow and glacier mass balance calibrating glacio hydrological models based on one of the variables i e runoff and mass balance would make others under or over estimated simulated runoff was underestimated up to 41 for aphrodite pgmfd and imerg and it was overestimated up to 69 for cfsr and har when the sphy model was calibrated for reference mass balance therefore by introducing the turc budyko formula in the evaluation approach we can conclude that gpds cannot be used directly in glacio hydrological modeling in glacierized mountain regions the proposed validation suggests

2833,recently gridded precipitation datasets gpds have become an essential input in hydrological modeling evaluation of their performance is a priori step before their application when they are applied to a glaciated catchment the glacier mass balance adds another dimension to the evaluation this study has attempted to introduce the turc budyko formula for validating the gpds in glaciated catchments this approach can identify the over or under estimation of catchment precipitation input by the gpds as a case study the approach was applied in upper indus basin uib located in high mountain asia the turc budyko formula and other commonly used evaluation techniques found that aphrodite underestimated the precipitation by 40 although it captured most of inter and intra annual variations of local climatology cc 0 6 cfsr and har were overestimated 106 and 77 and characterize uib as leaky catchment whereas underestimated gpds characterize uib as gaining catchment in leaky conditions glacier storage changes were positive 0 21 0 37 m w e yr 1 while gaining conditions made negative glacier storage changes 0 44 to 0 34 m w e yr 1 in uib none of the gpds represented true conditions of glacio hydrology in uib introducing the turc budyko formula confirmed that direct application of gpds in hydrological modeling is implausible because gpds generally cannot produce rational output of streamflow and mass balance simultaneously it is recommended to locally correct the gpds before any hydrological application in glacierized catchments keywords gridded precipitation

sensing data or a combination of them to overcome the problem of data scarcity and distribution biasness dee et al 2011 harris et al 2014 huffman and bolvin 2015 maussion et al 2014 saha et al 2010 yatagai et al 2012 these datasets provide continuous land coverage usually spanning from the 1960s to the present day with daily time steps and thus provide an opportunity for driving the hydrological simulation in the data scarce watersheds however the accuracy of gpds is uncertain due to their development methods sources and spatiotemporal resolution the reliability of these datasets is limited by total number of gauges spatial distribution and coverage data assimilation models and satellite algorithms ehsani and behrangi 2022 kidd et al 2017 pollock et al 2018 sun et al 2018 there are three primary types of gpds based sources and methods gauges based remote sensing and reanalysis datasets each kind of dataset has its advantages and limitations the gauge based observed precipitation is comparatively accurate it is often used as a reference to develop calibrate and evaluate other precipitation datasets the gauge characteristics e g windshield type height size shape and material also affect the accuracy of observations bogart and legates 2009 ehsani and behrangi 2022 sun et al 2018 the meteorological stations are sparse kidd et al 2017 and unevenly distributed in mountain regions most located at low elevations ji et al 2020 salio et al 2015 woldemeskel et al 2013 which induces bias in representing the catchment scale precipitation in mountainous glacierized regions immerzeel et al 2015 wortmann et al 2018 the gauge based gpds cannot be used for real time applications due to their latency and coarser temporal resolution kidd et al 2017 le coz et al 2021 furthermore the extreme values got smoother during interpolation for generating gpds affecting long term trends in regions with low density gauge networks hegerl et al 2015 sun et al 2018 trenberth et al 2017 overall gauge based precipitation is inconsistent between gpds and varies considerably from region to region in contrast remote sensing based gpds have finer spatial resolution and can present accurate precipitation in un gauged regions due to their broader coverage ehsani et al 2022 however they are less sensitive to snowfall and light rain and cannot capture the precipitation over ice and snow adhikari et al 2020 cao and liang 2018 liu et al 2019b the performance of remote sensing based datasets is also restricted under cloud covered conditions kidd et al 2012 and in representing the orographic precipitation processes in mountainous regions shige et al 2013 the satellite precipitation estimates are indirect and can induce significant variability in derived gpds ehsani et al 2021 additionally it is challenging to use satellite based gpds data for long term hydro climatic applications because of their shorter temporal coverage at the same time the reanalysis gpds generally provide more extended temporal coverage which makes them suitable for long term hydro climatic applications saha et al 2010 sheffield et al 2006 sun et al 2018 however source specific assessments showed that reanalysis datasets failed to represent many weather patterns bosilovich et al 2008 in addition reanalysis datasets had a greater degree of variability than the other types of datasets the inherent issues in all types of gpds sun et al 2018 yao et al 2020 make the selection of an appropriate input dataset very challenging for specific hydrological applications therefore priori evaluation of gpds is necessary to ensure whether they represent the local characteristics of hydrometeorology evaluation of the gpds is complicated in glacierized watersheds because of glacier involvement i e mass gain from the precipitation accumulation and mass loss due to melt release that becomes additional water input to streamflow shafeeque et al 2019 arguments arise when only observed rain gauge data are used to evaluate gpds ali et al 2017 anjum et al 2018 blacutt et al 2015 henn et al 2018 hu and chen 2018 hu et al 2016 hussain et al 2017 romilly and gebremichael 2011 because observation data might have been used in generating specific gpds in this case the data from corresponding grid cells may match the rain gauge data very well for some gpds but may fail with the others the differences in observation timing among different regional gauge networks create unlabeled multiday aggregations mekonnen et al 2021 sun et al 2014 that cause such discrepancies for different gpds on the other hand evaluation using rain gauge data cannot be performed in the high elevation zones where the rain gauges suffer from gauge undercatch issues due to wind pollock et al 2018 evaporation ehsani and behrangi 2022 and sublimation fassnacht 2004 or in some cases the data is just unavailable winiger et al 2005 in fact the station observations cannot capture the strong vertical gradients immerzeel et al 2015 because multiple local factors in mountainous regions make it difficult to analyze and understand the spatiotemporal variations in complex hydro climatic regimes lutz et al 2014 using the available gpds to drive the hydrological simulation is another way of evaluating them in both temporal spatial distributions and water balance tong et al 2014 the detailed hydrological simulation outputs can provide rich information for evaluating the gpds and diagnosing potential problems yet the most complicated task due to extensive data and model parameterization ragettli and pellicciotti 2012 therefore previous studies generally ignore the glacier involvement in their analysis data scarcity in the glacierized regions changes in glacier storage and glacial melt as an additional input to streamflow wang et al 2018 together make the hydrological behavior intricate it is noteworthy that ability of gpds to represent the rationality of glacier and hydrological outputs have never been assessed before in precipitation datasets validation studies on a watershed and annual scale a hydrological alternative of the turc budyko theory budyko 1974 turc 1954 represents water and energy balance coron et al 2015 valéry et al 2010 it connects the annual streamflow to the precipitation and evapotranspiration in a formula and provides a simple method to evaluate the annual precipitation by the observed streamflow it is usually applied with the assumption that the annual change in watershed storage is neglected andréassian and perrin 2012 however the relationship among precipitation evapotranspiration and streamflow goes beyond the abovementioned principles if glacier storage variates and meltwater contribute to streamflow glacial storage change can be detected by the turc budyko theory provided that glacial storage changes have been involved in the water balance shafeeque and luo 2021 thus applying the turc budyko theory is the most straightforward technique to estimate the change in glacial storage meanwhile the representation of local climatology and rationality of glacio hydrological outputs are also necessary for confirming the validity of a gpd in glacierized river basins therefore the potential problems of gpds and the involvement of glaciers can thus be detected by combining statistical validation physical diagnosis based on the turc budyko formula and glacio hydrological modeling the paper s main objective was to introduce the turc budyko formula in evaluating the gpds in glacierized catchments the proposed validation approach helps answer whether gpds can directly be applied in hydrological modeling studies in glacierized mountain regions to represent rational glacio hydrological behavior the proposed validation approach was applied as a case study in the highly glacierized upper indus basin uib located in high mountain asia 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area upper indus basin uib is located in high mountain asia and is covered by extensive glaciers 31 37 n and 72 82 e it covers 173 000 km2 and is distributed among china india and pakistan uib hosts the eastern hindukush western himalayas and karakoram mountain ranges inman 2010 khan et al 2015 mukhopadhyay and khan 2014 westerlies and summer monsoon precipitation systems fig 1 a are responsible for the annual precipitation in uib however the effect and contributions of both sources differ temporally and spatially the total number of glaciers is about 12 000 in uib covering 15 000 km2 with a glacier area ratio gar of about 12 bajracharya and shrestha 2011 the snow cover varies seasonally in uib with maximum snow in spring and a minimum in summer gurung et al 2017 the percent of snow covered area of uib ranges from 10 to 70 hasson et al 2014 uib was divided into three sub regions himalaya hmla hindukush hndksh and karakorum krkrm fig 1b to account for the influence of multiple climatic systems and unique interactions among the cryosphere atmosphere and hydrosphere 2 2 data table 1 briefly describes the sources of hydrology climate soil land use dem glacier mass balance and gpds data used in the study further details on these data are provided in the supplementary material 2 3 precipitation adjustment accurate precipitation estimates are pivotal for climate research studies and glacio hydrological modeling applications kidd et al 2012 shafeeque and luo 2021 however observed precipitation is underestimated immerzeel et al 2015 wortmann et al 2018 due to biased vertical distribution of gauges kidd et al 2017 winiger et al 2005 and higher gauge undercatch for solid precipitation ehsani and behrangi 2022 hirabayashi et al 2008 jimeno sáez et al 2020 previous studies suggest that further efforts are needed to reduce gauge undercatch errors pollock et al 2018 by installing more accurate gauges e g disdrometer and radars sun et al 2018 and developing improved methods to correct their undercatch ehsani and behrangi 2022 in the current study observed precipitation was adjusted for the selected stations based on the corrected precipitation in dahri et al 2018 the spatial fields for adjusted observed precipitation obs were generated by interpolating and resampling the point observations fig 1d for comparison with gpds which were also resampled at a common resolution of 0 25 0 25 using a simple resampling technique nearest neighbor the average annual adjusted precipitation was 540 180 mm yr 1 36 higher than the uncorrected during 1951 2017 in uib fig 1e 2 4 validation approach we introduce the turc budyko formula to validate the water energy mass balance of a glaciated catchment in addition we also adopt the commonly used technique such as statistical performance evaluation of gpds against obs for investigating the ability of gpds to represent the local climatology and practical simulation using glacio hydrological models to investigate the rationality of simulated hydrology and glacier changes a schematic diagram of the validation approach is provided in fig 2 incorporating physical diagnosis based on water energy mass balance is the most important contribution to the proposed validation approach the physical diagnosis was performed to identify the actual over and under estimation of the gpds at watershed scale based on the water energy mass balance a hydrological alternative of the turc budyko plot andréassian and perrin 2012 was used to diagnose the gpds for reproducing a plausible water energy balance the most widely used type of representation is proposed by turc 1954 and budyko 1974 finally the water balance equation of a glacierized catchment was used to estimate the change in glacier storage i e mass balance for each dataset this method tests the realistic closure of the water energy balance using precipitation from each dataset long term water yield or runoff coefficient q p was plotted as a function of long term aridity index p etp coron et al 2015 valéry et al 2010 i e 1 q p f p e t p 2 p q α et p w h e r e α 1 where q mm yr 1 p mm yr 1 and etp mm yr 1 represent specific runoff precipitation and evapotranspiration in a catchment respectively plotting the aridity index on the x axis also allows focusing on the wettest and driest catchments based on input precipitation wetter catchment corresponds to a higher p etp value the physical interpretation of this hydrological representation is based on three assumptions 1 q 0 2 q p etp and 3 q p fig 2 in glacierized catchments the simplest water balance equation can be written as 3 δ s δ t p q et a m b where eta mm yr 1 and mb mm w e yr 1 represent actual evapotranspiration and mass balance in the watershed respectively the imbalance in eq 3 is storage change δs the groundwater percolation is compensated by baseflow over multiple years as considered by immerzeel et al 2015 therefore it does not pose a significant impact on overall balance thus all changes in storage are considered as mass balance when δs 0 the catchment is a perfect true catchment meanwhile a true catchment can have a slight positive or negative change in storage depending on the quality of observed mass balance and eta the gaining catchments always have a negative change in storage δs 0 and the leaky catchments always have positive changes in storage δs 0 the negative change in storage results in the melting of glaciers and contributes additional water to total runoff in contrast positive change in storage represents advancing glaciers in a catchment where heavy precipitation falls in solid form and is stored as glaciers the glacio hydrological modeling was included in the validation approach to ensure whether gpds can simultaneously produce balanced outputs of streamflow and glacier changes the observed glacier modis snow cover and hydrology data were used to calibrate the glacio hydrological model details in supplementary material and then the simulated results of runoff and mass balance are analyzed for rationality in a glacierized catchment the spatial processes in hydrology sphy model terink et al 2015 was used for the practical validation of the ability of all the precipitation datasets to simulate rational hydrology and glacier changes six sphy projects were set up for each precipitation dataset i e sphy obs sphy aphrodite sphy cfsr sphy har sphy pgmfd and sphy imerg the detailed calibration and validation for these sphy projects are described in the supplementary material 3 results 3 1 statistical validation based on climatology the amount of precipitation in cfsr and har was overestimated compared to obs in uib average annual precipitation was found as 323 99 to 1115 419 mm yr 1 for gpds smallest for aphrodite and greatest for cfsr over varying periods from 1951 to 2017 respectively fig 3 a the correlation coefficient cc for cfsr was the lowest 0 2 whereas its value of bias 106 was the highest in uib table 2 the performance of har to represent the inter annual variations of obs was unsatisfactory due to higher bias 77 and lower correlation cc 0 3 the performance of aphrodite to represent the pattern of annual variations was better identified in uib with a higher correlation cc 0 6 followed by imerg and pgmfd fig 3g however annual aphrodite precipitation was underestimated by 40 in uib table 2 the most part 61 of annual obs occurred in the winter and spring season in uib fig 3c averagely the winter and spring season precipitation was overestimated by cfsr and har by 133 and 116 respectively whereas it was underestimated by aphrodite 47 pgmfd 29 and imerg 41 3 2 physical validation based on the water energy mass balance the physical realism of gpds was tested by identifying the glacier involvement in the water balance literature and remote sensing mass balance data were used for comparison purposes the overall change in water storage based on grace data was 0 15 m w e yr 1 fig 4 which matched the observed δs 0 17 m w e yr 1 used in water energy and mass balance calculations for each selected gpd the uib was characterized as true gaining and leaky catchment in the gaining catchments which break the water limit q p additional water is added to the water balance which is contributed by glacier melt in the glacierized catchments such catchment behavior results in a negative change in glacier storage δs 0 for example in the hmla sub region all the datasets were gaining and meltwater contributed to the total runoff fig 4a on the other hand in the leaky catchments which break the energy limit q p etp some quantity of water is missing from the expected water balance cfsr and har were identified to make the study area extremely wet based on the aridity index values fig 4a however the observed water balance was less than the expected water balance this missing water was stored in the form of positive glacier storage δs 0 cfsr and har made hindukush and karakorum sub regions and the entire uib domain leaky where missing water from the water balance results in advancing glaciers the δs based on all datasets ranged between 0 44 to 0 37 m w e y 1 fig 4c the etp values used in the hydrological alternative of the turc budyko plot may have a slight effect on the results therefore we performed uncertainty analysis to highlight the extent of the variations caused by variations in etp values a slight increase 0 03 0 01 m w e yr 1 in the estimated mass balance was noted with decreasing etp and vice versa 0 02 0 01 m w e yr 1 in uib fig 5 a the krkrm region did not show any significant effect of variations in etp values on mass balance fig 5a higher etp reduced the aridity index by 0 20 0 12 and moved the catchments towards drier conditions in the hydrological plot fig 5b contrary smaller etp moved catchments towards wetter conditions by increasing the aridity index 0 12 0 05 all the subregions were less sensitive to increasing etp values than decreasing values fig 5b meanwhile hmla subregion responded with lesser sensitivity to the decreasing etp than other subregions fig 5b the observed precipitation was adjusted before using it in evaluation because it was not representing the realistic water and mass balance in uib fig 5c d highlights the sensitivity of results to the observed precipitation adjustment in uib all gpds showed higher cc with corrected precipitation except har which had higher cc with uncorrected precipitation fig 5c in the krkrm subregion the centered rmse and sd were higher in case of corrected precipitation for aphrodite pgmfd and imerg however cc was not affected significantly in the hndksh subregion pgmfd showed a decrease in cc whereas aphrodite correlation was increased in the case of uncorrected precipitation fig 5c the calculated storage changes based on uncorrected observed precipitation were unrealistic compared to the actual situation in uib in the case of uncorrected precipitation the storage changes were 43 32 136 and 108 more negative in hmla hndksh krkrm and uib respectively fig 5d higher glacier involvement in hydrology will translate into higher uncertainty when used uncorrected precipitation for gpd evaluation in glacierized regions such a high difference compared to the realistic conditions would cause significant uncertainty in evaluating gpds overall the precipitation adjustment improved the evaluation results in highly glacierized uib 3 3 rational hydrology and glacier changes the sphy model was calibrated and validated using the snow cover mass balance and streamflow data in uib a rationality technique in which one of the two variables mass balance and streamflow was kept constant to avoid the risk of equifinality was used due to the glacier compensation effect lang 1986 we focused on fixing the average annual mass balance in uib the simulated mass balance by sphy obs sphy aphrodite sphy cfsr sphy har sphy pgmfd and sphy imerg was 0 17 σ where σ 0 10 0 48 m w e y 1 for 2002 2007 respectively fig 6 e the simulated annual runoff 263 23 to 743 71 mm yr 1 was underestimated for all datasets except cfsr and har from 2002 to 2007 fig 6a the pbias of annual runoff for gpds compared to observed data was between 41 underestimated by 33 8 and 69 60 9 for the sphy projects the highest positive pbias was noted for sphy cfsr followed by sphy har in contrast the maximum negative pbias was noticed for the sphy aphrodite project fig 6d the results highlighted that the simulated runoff broke the rationality of glacio hydrological outputs when the simulated mass balance was calibrated with reference mass balance in the basin in uib the total runoff was contributed first by snow runoff in the late spring to early summer and then glacier runoff started contributing to generate maximum flows in summer fig 7 a baseflow joined the total runoff having a recession of more than three and a half months recession days 110 supplementary table s4 after percolation during the melting season on annual scale the glacier snow baseflow and rainfall runoff contributed to total runoff ranging between 44 and 49 30 35 14 20 and 3 5 respectively fig 7a the spatial distribution of total runoff and its components simulated under sphy projects confirmed that the underestimated gpds produced underestimated runoff and vice versa the snow runoff contributions were relatively higher from the hndksh and western parts of the hmla subregion in contrast glacier runoff was contributed by the krkrm subregion fig 7b meanwhile the differences in snowmelt and glacier melt components were higher for different gpds especially in the karakorum sub region these datasets were ranked as aphrodite imerg pgmfd cfsr har based on the overall performance of selected gpds gpds must be corrected to represent local characteristics before being used for further hydrological modeling applications 4 discussions 4 1 representation of local climatology performance evaluation of gpds in representing observed climatology would be beneficial for assessing the expected uncertainties in simulated glacio hydrologic outputs the spatial and temporal distribution of mean annual gpds precipitation shows diverse differences in magnitudes and patterns compared with obs fig 3 aphrodite performed better in representing the patterns in interannual variations cc 0 6 fig 3g however annual precipitation was highly underestimated 40 table 2 the winter and spring precipitation was underestimated in aphrodite 47 imerg 41 and pgmfd 29 whereas it was overestimated in cfsr 133 and har 116 fig 3c most winter and spring precipitation falling in solid form at higher altitudes is underrepresented in most gpds the statistical evaluation indicated that these gpds would cause under or over estimations in simulated glacio hydrological outputs the reliability of statistical approaches in evaluating gpds and the extent of expected uncertainties in hydrological simulations might have low confidence the reasons for such low confidence include observed data that is unevenly distributed insufficient or missing especially at higher elevations some of the data have already been used to generate gpds additionally the runoff peak is significantly different from lags behind the precipitation peak fig 3b although these approaches have been applied in multiple previous studies to evaluate the performance of gpds ali et al 2017 anjum et al 2018 blacutt et al 2015 henn et al 2018 hu and chen 2018 hu et al 2016 hussain et al 2017 romilly and gebremichael 2011 however the authenticity of such statistical evaluation is questionable when the observed data is insufficient or of inferior quality due to the uneven distribution of meteorological stations which is the case in high elevation glacierized river basins moreover observed data have been used in generating or calibrating gpds in one or the other forms dee et al 2011 harris et al 2014 huffman and bolvin 2015 maussion et al 2014 saha et al 2010 yatagai et al 2012 which cause pseudo high performance in grid cells covering observation stations in uib the observed precipitation does not represent the true conditions due to multiple factors including low elevation stations immerzeel et al 2015 complex topography and multiple precipitation systems hasson et al 2017 correcting the precipitation before applying it for such performance evaluations is necessary in the current study the observed precipitation data were adjusted using the corrected precipitation in uib the adjusted precipitation was 36 greater than the uncorrected precipitation fig 1 while using the corrected precipitation as a reference the reanalysis dataset i e cfsr and model based downscaled dataset i e har show overestimation in all the sub regions in contrast the observation based dataset i e aphrodite satellite based dataset i e imerg and reanalysis and observation combined dataset i e pgmfd show underestimations different researchers made similar concluding remarks for reanalysis interpolated and satellite based datasets dahri et al 2016 ji et al 2020 liu et al 2019a liu et al 2018 yao et al 2020 the reanalysis datasets account for both solid and liquid precipitation more consistently which may explain their overestimation in high mountain glacierized regions blacutt et al 2015 however observation interpolated and satellite estimations based datasets have difficulty in detecting the snowfall ehsani and behrangi 2022 rasmussen et al 2012 wang et al 2013 it is important to note that interpolation of gauge observations to generate gpds smooths the extreme values and introduces fake trends and variability into reanalysis outputs bengtsson 2004 hegerl et al 2015 sun et al 2018 trenberth et al 2017 therefore trends and magnitude variabilities from gpds should be treated carefully for hydrological applications although gpds have captured the monthly distribution patterns of obs precipitation these datasets show significant differences in their monthly seasonal and annual magnitudes mismatch in the timing of gauge observations undercatched solid precipitation and precipitation intermittency can cause discrepancies among the gpds ehsani and behrangi 2022 ehsani et al 2021 mekonnen et al 2021 trenberth et al 2017 moreover the large under and over estimations for the gpds over elevational profiles may have been caused by the dynamic climatic system pang et al 2014 precipitation dependency on altitude immerzeel et al 2015 wortmann et al 2018 and the approaches used to generate these datasets harris et al 2014 huffman et al 2010 saha et al 2010 the reason for the better representation of obs climatology by the aphrodite dataset is the use of observed data in its generation however the precipitation at ungauged elevation ranges is not extrapolated in the aphrodite dataset ji et al 2020 yatagai et al 2012 which would affect its direct application in mountain glacierized catchments glaciers contribute significantly to annual runoff fig 7a and the peak of hydrographs lags almost three months from the peak of hyetographs fig 3b in uib in addition to the inherited pros and cons of gpds and complexities in reference data for evaluation the involvement of glaciers highlights that a simple statistical approach alone cannot answer whether gpds can directly be applied in hydrological simulations of glacierized river basins 4 2 representation of water energy mass balance introducing the turc budyko formula into the validation approach helps identify the actual under or over estimation of gpds based on watershed water energy mass balance diagnosing their possible causes and providing directions for local correction in glacierized river basins the physical diagnosis component in the validation approach also helps detect the possible effects of meltwater on the changes in glacier storage based on the water energy mass balance the problems in gpds can be diagnosed by analyzing the physical factors involved in these effects the physical diagnosis identifies the true gaining and leaky catchments based on the water input into the catchment uib was identified as gaining catchment based on aphrodite pgmfd and imerg whereas it was leaky based on cfsr and har fig 4a there are three possible reasons for the case of gaining catchment a additional water contribution from glacier melt characterized by a negative change in glacier storage which is the case in uib immerzeel et al 2015 b underestimated precipitation valéry et al 2010 which is true for aphrodite 40 pgmfd 24 and imerg 43 table 2 and c errors in runoff measurements andréassian and perrin 2012 underestimation of precipitation and additional water term in water balance is evident from previous studies in uib dahri et al 2016 immerzeel et al 2015 lutz et al 2014 similarly rasmussen et al 2012 found that the chances of snow under catch might be as high as 20 50 in high altitude mountainous areas which is the case in uib especially in the hindukush and karakorum sub regions the possibility of runoff measurement errors has also been warned in different studies in the region mukhopadhyay and khan 2014 on the other hand for the leaky catchments there might be four reasons in addition to discharge measurement errors underestimation a errors in the estimation of etp underestimation b overestimated precipitation which is the case for cfsr 106 and har 77 table 2 c higher infiltration or local aquifer recharge or d underground water flow towards another aquifer andréassian and perrin 2012 the impact of inter catchment groundwater flow on the behavior of leaky catchments has been analyzed in france by le moine et al 2007 who suggested that underground water affects the overall water balance however in uib the overestimation of precipitation in these datasets is the most probable reason for leaky catchment behavior under cfsr and har the bed is rocky and vegetation is very low in uib such conditions strengthening the conclusion of overestimated cfsr and har precipitation several researchers blacutt et al 2015 liu et al 2018 silva et al 2011 have provided evidence for overestimated cfsr precipitation in different parts of the world in the hydrological alternative of turc budyko plot the water limit helps identify the additional water term in the water balance or missing water input aphrodite imerg and pgmfd are out of water limit fig 4a and the missing precipitation in these datasets may be due to the undercatched and undetected solid precipitation at higher elevations adhikari et al 2020 ehsani and behrangi 2022 ehsani et al 2021 pollock et al 2018 rasmussen et al 2012 if such datasets were used in hydrological simulations they would result in a highly negative mass balance long term and simulate implausible conditions in the glacierized catchment these datasets are insufficient to close the realistic water energy mass balance in glacierized regions higher negative storage change values up to 0 44 m w e yr 1 prove this claim fig 4c on the other hand cfsr and har are mostly out of energy limit and the overestimated water input will result in higher positive storage change 0 37 m w e yr 1 and it may simulate implausible positive mass balance conditions in glacio hydrological modeling the physical diagnosis of gpds in uib indicates that gpds may not reproduce the true water balance and most of them might be unsuitable for hydrological applications in such glacierized catchments similar concerns were highlighted by dahri et al 2016 who performed an evaluation of gpds and their unsuitability to force the hydrological models in uib the above discussion suggests that the direct application of gpds in hydrological simulations would be inefficient the difference between the actual and estimated mass balance for each dataset helps derive the correction factors for adjusting the magnitude of precipitation in gpds 4 3 rationality of simulated hydrology and glacier changes the practical simulation component in the proposed validation approach ensures the ability of a gpd to represent the balanced outputs of glacier processes and streamflow simultaneously when the gpds are underestimated for example aphrodite imerg and pgmfd table 2 they are insufficient to reproduce the hydrology and mass balance at the same time fig 6 adjusting one of them during the calibration process would cause underestimations in the other in simulated results when the gpds are overestimated for example cfsr and har may overestimate at least one of the simulated streamflow or glacier mass balance fig 6 the inferences are reliable because we dealt with the glacier compensation effect lang 1986 during the calibration and re tuning of the sphy projects the differences in simulated runoff magnitudes are the actual reflections of the differences in precipitation magnitudes for gpds similar percent contributions from runoff components to total annual runoff fig 7a prove that the glacier compensation effect was eliminated effectively otherwise the underestimated precipitation may be compensated with other water balance components e g evapotranspiration snow or glacier melt ragettli and pellicciotti 2012 schaefli 2005 shafeeque et al 2019 a false calibration parameter set would enhance the simulated meltwater to reduce the bias between simulated and observed runoff ragettli and pellicciotti 2012 wang et al 2018 for example in the case of the sphy model forced by aphrodite pgmfd and imerg precipitation datasets to enhance the simulated runoff a higher negative mass balance would result however keeping the average mass balance closer to observed mass balance data fig 6e eliminated such risk of uncertainty hence the uncertainties in the simulated outputs of glacio hydrological applications can be identified using the validation approach based on the quantitative results of the current study it is concluded that gpds generally cannot reproduce the rational output of glacier changes and hydrology in glacierized catchments thus gpds cannot be applied directly in hydrological simulations in such regions therefore correcting the gpds using local physical characteristics such as mass and water balance is recommended before any hydrological application in glacierized catchments seasonal distribution of runoff components helps derive the correction factors for seasonal adjustments of gpds precipitation combined with observed local climatology the spatiotemporal information on snowfall and meltwater distributions during winter and summer would be useful to derive correction factors for a precise correction 4 4 limitations and implications the use of non dimensional hydrological representation is suitable and advantageous because physical data like runoff evapotranspiration and precipitation are frequently measured or calculated in any watershed andréassian and perrin 2012 however the methods applied to calculate etp may affect the overall representation of the hydrological alternative of the turc budyko plot fig 5 coron et al 2015 argued that the energy limit might also depend on the chosen etp formula in the current study we used hargreaves s method hargreaves and samani 1985 which may ignore most climatic parameters and use only temperature data the variations in calculated etp did not cause many variations in estimated mass balance and water energy limits fig 5 that can significantly affect the overall results in our case study additionally precipitation adjustment positively impacted the overall evaluation results fig 5c d apparently the number of selected gpds five datasets looks small however they represent all categories of gpds and serve the purpose of demonstration in our case study as gpds have differences in their spatiotemporal resolutions covered time and underlying methodologies sun et al 2018 the gpds based on various sources and different methods were selected for analysis in this study i e reanalysis cfsr observed interpolation aphrodite the combination of reanalysis and observed interpolations pgmfd satellite observations imerg and downscaled model output har the case study validation with a limited number of gpds is only for demonstration purposes meanwhile the proposed validation approach can be used for any gpds and applies in any mountain glacier region it is essential to highlight that most datasets are not independent of each other as most of them include the same station observations directly or assimilate them somehow however this connection among gpds is a common problem in comparison studies which cannot be avoided the understandings developed using the proposed validation approach are also effective for the data generators and algorithm developers to improve their work keeping in mind the application demands for real time scenarios the actual under or over estimation identified in physical diagnosis can be used to derive correction factors for adjusting the magnitude of annual precipitation in gpds meanwhile seasonal distributions of snowfall and meltwater identified in glacio hydrological modeling combined with observed local climatology can be used to derive correction factors for seasonal corrections of gpds it is important to highlight that adding more explanatory variables would improve the selection of gpds for hydrological modeling applications however adding more explanatory variables requires more data and computations to assess the related uncertainties ragettli and pellicciotti 2012 in lack of sufficient data and complexities in glacier simulation schemes might also increase the overall uncertainty marzeion et al 2020 rounce et al 2020 on one hand adding more explanatory variables might improve the evaluation results with expensive observed data and computation capacity pellicciotti et al 2012 on the other hand there is a likely risk of increasing uncertainties due to insufficient parametrization calibration or validation under complex conditions ragettli et al 2013 in any case the spatiotemporal scope of their application would be limited sufficient data and appropriate computational capacity are prerequisites for recommending the inclusion of more variables in evaluation approaches 5 conclusions involving the turc budyko formula in evaluating the gpds helps determine whether the direct application of gpds in hydrological modeling is plausible in glacierized mountain regions where glacier involvement complicates the hydrology this study quantitatively investigated representative gpds from different categories proposing an advanced validation approach a sequential combination of statistical validation physical diagnosis based on the turc budyko formula and practical application in glacio hydrological simulations the statistical validation identifies the potential problems in the spatiotemporal distribution of the datasets e g aphrodite represents the monthly and seasonal distributions and interannual variations cc 0 6 but was underestimated on the other hand cfsr and har were overestimated and did not represent the inter annual variations in uib cc 0 3 reanalysis based gpds are generally overestimated 77 106 whereas observation and satellite based gpds were underestimated 43 to 24 the underestimated gpds would result in an underestimated hydrology when applied in glacio hydrological simulations the physical diagnosis based on the turc budyko formula identifies that aphrodite imerg and pgmfd datasets make the catchments gaining indicating an additional water source in water balance due to glacier melting results in negative glacier storage 0 44 to 0 34 m w e yr 1 on the other hand cfsr and har make the catchments leaky highlighting a positive change in glacier storage 0 37 and 0 21 m w e yr 1 respectively the actual under and over estimation based on physical diagnosis provides the basic directions for local corrections in magnitudes of gpds in glacierized mountain regions the gaining catchments characterized by underestimated precipitation need more input water higher precipitation to sustain water and mass balance concurrently whereas leaky catchments characterized by overestimated precipitation need lesser input water to reproduce the plausible water energy and mass balance in a glacierized catchment simultaneously the gpds generally cannot concurrently fulfill the requirements of the rational output of streamflow and glacier mass balance calibrating glacio hydrological models based on one of the variables i e runoff and mass balance would make others under or over estimated simulated runoff was underestimated up to 41 for aphrodite pgmfd and imerg and it was overestimated up to 69 for cfsr and har when the sphy model was calibrated for reference mass balance therefore by introducing the turc budyko formula in the evaluation approach we can conclude that gpds cannot be used directly in glacio hydrological modeling in glacierized mountain regions the proposed validation suggests

2834,real time control rtc technology is increasingly applied in rainwater harvesting rwh systems to optimise their performance related to water supply and flood mitigation however most studies to date have focussed on testing the benefits at an individual site scale leaving the potential benefits for downstream stormwater networks largely untested in this study we developed a methodology to predict how at source rtc rwh systems influence the behaviour of a stormwater network simulation was enabled by coupling the drainage model in swmm with an rtc rwh model coded using the r software we modelled two different rtc strategies across a range of system settings e g storage size for rwh and proportion of storage to which rtc is applied under two different climate scenarios current and future climates the simulations showed that rtc reduced flooding volume and peak flow of the stormwater network leading to a potential mitigation of urban flooding risks while also providing a decentralised supplementary water supply implementing rtc in more of rwh storages yielded greater benefits than simply increasing storage capacity in both current and future climates more importantly the rtc systems are capable of more precisely managing the resultant flow regime in reducing the erosion and restoring the pre development conditions in sensitive receiving waters our study suggests that rtc rwh storages distributed throughout a catchment can substantially improve the performance of existing drainage systems potentially avoiding or deferring expensive network upgrades investments in real time control technology would appear to be more promising than investments in detention volume alone keywords real time control rainwater harvesting systems stormwater control measures flood

management water scarcity caused by population growth and dwindling freshwater resources is still a major social and economic challenge in many cities vörösmarty et al 2010 urban flooding risks are increased by the excessive surface runoff and intensified peak flow which result from increased impervious areas in conventional stormwater drainage networks jongman et al 2012 nirupama and simonovic 2006 these conventional stormwater networks which aim to drain stormwater in the quickest possible time through hydraulically efficient infrastructure e g pipes also connect impervious runoff directly to the receiving water grossly altering natural flow regimes through increased frequency and magnitude of stormwater flow bhaskar et al 2016 leopold 1968 along with reduced recession times burns et al

traditional source of primary or supplementary water supply gardner and vieritz 2010 mikkelsen et al 1999 ward et al 2012 they also act as a stormwater control measure scm capturing and storing the runoff from impervious surfaces e g roofs which is then diverted to supply household end uses such a design provides complementary retention to reduce the volume frequency and peak of urban runoff which can reduce stormwater network overflows and mitigate urban flooding risks burns et al 2015 jamali et al 2019 schubert et al 2017 such systems offer benefits in potentially delaying the upgrade of water supply and drainage infrastructure coombes kuczera 2003 although the extent of benefit depends strongly on their storage capacity and characteristics of the household water demand campisano and modica 2016 application of real time control rtc technology has the potential to enhance rwh performance in relation to both water supply and flood mitigation roman et al 2017 xu et al 2020a real time control is a collection of software sensors communication devices and actuators bennett 1994 which can be combined to provide rwh systems with digital information e g rainfall forecast and adapt its operation in real time in response to operating conditions doing so allows rwh systems to evolve from their conventional static nature to highly adaptive kerkez et al 2016 real time controlled rwh systems generally release stored rainwater prior to a rainfall event termed here as pre storm releases through a remotely controlled discharge structure to proactively create sufficient capacity for the predicted inflows thus minimizing the magnitude and frequency of uncontrolled overflows a range of modelling and empirical studies have demonstrated that rtc outperforms conventional rwh systems in stormwater retention and peak flow reduction gee and hunt 2016 oberascher et al 2019 roman et al 2017 with no meaningful impact on water supply performance melville shreeve et al 2016 xu et al 2018 real time control application to rainwater has advanced in recent times to include the use of longer rainfall forecast windows xu et al 2020b modelled three different rtc strategies using a 7 day lead precipitation forecast they found that increasing the rainfall forecast window which extends the predictive horizon of the pre storm releases resulted in a better attenuation of the peak flow this approach also reduced overflow frequency and extended the recession time leading to an rtc outflow regime much closer to that of natural streams xu et al 2020b such an approach could potentially counteract the negative hydrologic impacts caused by urbanisation leopold 1968 poff et al 2010 the focus of rtc application to rwh systems to date has mainly been on the effectiveness at the land parcel leaving its impacts on stormwater networks largely untested xu et al 2020a understanding whether the benefits gained at each parcel can be accumulated and translated to a larger scale such as the catchment is vital to understand the potential cost effectiveness of rtc rwh systems for adapting to a changing climate this requires explicit consideration of the behaviour of a distributed network of rtc rwh systems and the hydraulic behaviour of the stormwater network in this study we evaluated the impact of at source rtc rwh systems on the behaviour of a stormwater network we adopted two different rtc strategies to i mitigate floods and ii deliver a more natural overall flow regime for further details see xu et al 2020b and modelled their impact on a stormwater network across a range of system settings under two different climate scenarios i e current and future climates during a 7 month simulation period network flooding volume and peak flow reduction were characterised with a more detailed analysis on the network outflow regime we hypothesised that operating rwh systems using rtc could reduce flooding volume and peak flow for a stormwater network in both current and future climates which could mitigate the risks of urban flooding while providing a decentralised supplementary water supply our results demonstrated that implementing higher proportions of rtc systems provided larger benefits than simply increasing the storage capacity potentially avoiding or deferring expensive upgrades for stormwater infrastructure our work provides useful insights for application of at source rtc rwh systems in future smart stormwater management 2 methods to predict the impact of rtc rwh systems on the performance of a stormwater network we used a modelling approach which combined outputs from a volumetric rtc rwh behaviour model coded in r software version 4 1 r core team 2021 with the 1 d hydraulic model in the stormwater management model swmm version 5 1 executed by pcswmm 7 4 rossman 2015 a similar modelling tool is also available in python as an integrated library pyswmm mcdonnell et al 2020 the steps are illustrated in fig 1 and details are given below the analysis was undertaken on a stormwater network located in a city in the province of quebec in canada for which the swmm model was adapted from shishegar et al 2021 rwh systems were assumed to only connect to roofs while stormwater runoff from other surfaces e g pavement was conveyed directly to the drainage network 2 1 rtc strategies we adopted two rtc strategies as per xu et al 2020b strategy s1 flood mitigation was designed to minimise storage overflows and strategy s2 longest discharge was designed to attenuate the flashiness and magnitude of pre storm releases to return to a more natural flow regime in strategy s1 overflows predicted to occur within the next seven days are released uniformly over the next 24 hr window in contrast strategy s2 aims to achieve the longest possible duration for each pre storm release i e the pre storm releases start seven days in advance and finish before the predicted rain both rtc strategies are based on 7 day lead rainfall forecast with the forecast assumed to be perfect i e no forecast error was modelled as the forecast error has little impact on overall system performance when a 7 day rolling horizon is applied see more details in section 2 2 2 shishegar et al 2021 2 2 modelling procedure a modelling procedure fig 1 was developed to test the performance of the proposed rtc system this procedure includes three different modules rainfall runoff module m1 rtc module m2 and drainage simulation module m3 m1 utilises a hydrological model providing the 6 min catchment runoff and daily runoff forecast as input to m2 m2 generates the outflow from each at source rtc system using the pre defined control strategies as explained in section 2 1 which is then used by m3 to model the flow dynamics in the stormwater network m1 and m3 were enabled by swmm while m2 was computed by a custom written rtc algorithm in r software 2 2 1 m1 rainfall runoff module in m1 two distinct runoff sources were generated the roof runoff used as the inflow to the rwh system and the surface runoff from the remaining surfaces of the catchment both were simulated by the rainfall runoff model in swmm see more details in section 2 3 study catchment using real rainfall data roof runoff was modelled separately from other land uses i e pavement and pervious areas because the rtc rwh behaviour cannot be implemented directly in swmm the prediction and control of the rtc systems were therefore run in the rtc module m2 roof areas were obtained by mapping each individual household and were grouped by each catchment boundary i e each catchment had one integrated roof area the imperviousness of roofs was assumed to be 100 and with a depression storage of 1 5 mm american society of civil engineers 1992 the imperviousness of each catchment for other surfaces e g pavement and pervious area was then recalculated to exclude the area of roof catchment based on the mapping of the study catchment 2 2 2 m2 real time control module the rtc module m2 determines the pre storm releases through control variables and simulates the performance of rtc systems under different strategies it consists of three steps in the first step rwh prediction operating at a daily time step anticipates system overflows for rtc decision making using the rainwater harvesting behaviour model eqs 1 3 yield after spillage rules were applied to provide a more accurate estimation of yield fewkes butler 2000 equation 1 system inflow was predicted prior to the actual events using a 7 day runoff forecast extracted from the output of m1 the forecast is updated every 24 h overflows are considered as unregulated i e they occurred whenever the maximum capacity is exceeded first flush diversion system was excluded from the model given that the use type and volumetric behaviour of filtration devices if present is highly variable 1 q o i t m a x v i t 1 q a i t s i 0 2 y i t m i n d i t v i t 1 q b i t 3 v i t m i n v i t 1 q a i t y i t q b i t s i y i t q b i t where v i t and v i t 1 are the volume l in system i i n t at the end of time step t current and t 1 previous respectively y i t is the rainwater yield in system i at t l timestep q b i t is the rtc pre storm release control variable from system i at t l timestep q o i t is tank overflow from system i at t l timestep s i is tank storage capacity l of system i d i t is the demand l timestep from tank i at time t q a i t is the system i inflow at time t l timestep n t represents the set of tanks in the second step pre storm release plans are developed to minimize the system overflows based on the developed strategies the overflow volume predicted for the rtc system corresponds to all roof surfaces connected to rtc rwh systems see more details in section 2 3 in the third step the rwh simulation fig 1 models the performance of defined controls using the rwh behaviour model equations 1 3 while the process is similar to rwh prediction this step is run on a 6 min time step to capture system inflow and outflow dynamics it utilised continuous simulation assuming that all systems were empty at the beginning of the entire simulation period meaning that this initial condition will not reset at each event finally outflows i e pre storm releases and any overflows from each system are summed and fed into the drainage simulation module m3 prediction and simulation components are operated on a 7 day rolling horizon this setting also known as receding horizon has been used in the model predictive control of urban drainage systems lund et al 2018 rwh prediction decides the rtc plan for the next 7 day period given its ability to inform controlled releases long before the actual event xu et al 2020b however only the actions in the first 24 hour period of that rolling horizon are implemented in the rwh simulation component which is then renewed recursively on a daily basis when forecast information is updated this approach creates the possibility to account for forecast errors which typically decrease as the forecast window decreases to minimise the impact of these errors on system performance 2 2 3 m3 drainage simulation module combining r and swmm model the drainage simulation module m3 based on swmm aims to model the impact of rtc and rwh systems on flow dynamics in stormwater networks outflow time series data from m2 are fed into each catchment node as external inflow representing the flow from roof areas each roof area is set to be 0 imperviousness with depression storages of 99 mm to ensure zero runoff is produced in the hydrological model as the roof runoff is being modelled by m1 finally model results such as total flooding volume and network outflow are stored and evaluated using a range of assessment metrics see section 2 4 2 3 study catchment the study area is a small urban district with primarily residential land use located in a mid size municipality in the province of quebec canada it is approximately 7 3 ha in area with an average imperviousness of 45 9 and includes 70 houses with an average roof area of 188 8 m2 the swmm model of the drainage network was adapted from shishegar et al 2021 fig 2 the study catchment is drained to a combined sewer system with limited capacity with recorded flooding issues in upstream nodes for this study a separate stormwater system is assumed by excluding the wastewater flow i e set as zero the study catchment consists of 10 subcatchments with an average slope of 2 10 nodes and 10 pipes with diameters varying from 200 mm upstream to 600 mm downstream rainfall observations adopted from shishegar et al 2021 were obtained from a rain gauge near the study stormwater network latitude 46 01 00 n longitude 71 57 00 w environment and climate change canada 2021 an individual rain event was defined as having more than 0 2 mm of rainfall with an antecedent dry period of 6 hr in total 77 rain events were exacted from a 7 month period i e 1st april to 31st oct 2013 with total precipitation of 796 4 mm a domestic water demand profile was adopted from local authority data ministry of municipal affairs and housing 2020 which indicates a daily water consumption of 275 l person day a population of 2 1 person per household was assumed according to the census in the nearby catchment statistics canada 2017 rwh systems were assumed to supply toilet flushing which counts for 30 of the domestic demand with two peak usages at 9 am and 7 pm in the diurnal pattern leading to 173 3 l day for each household although such supply has not been implemented in this study catchment it is commonly used in many countries such as australia europe and america reflecting the general use of rainwater harvesting systems campisano et al 2017 2 4 scenarios and input data a range of scenarios were designed to test the impact of rtc system settings on network performance we considered five rainwater storage capacities relative to the roof areas i e 5 10 20 40 80 l m2 and five different storage capacities to which rtc is applied e g 100 represents all rwh systems are operated by rtc all of these were compared to a baseline scenario i e no rwh system two climate conditions current and future were applied to evaluate the performance of the proposed rtc strategies in the context of climate change future rainfall is projected by adding a fixed factor of 15 to all rainfall data values this simple approach has been adopted by previous studies in the southern québec region bilodeau et al 2018 shishegar et al 2021 although future increases in rainfall intensities are likely in reality to vary by region season ouranos 2015 and return period of rainfall events mailhot et al 2012 2 5 assessment metrics two metrics were adopted to quantitatively evaluate the impact of rtc rwh systems on the drainage network performance namely peak flow and flooding volume reduction table 1 these metrics were both assessed at the catchment scale and quantify respectively the maximum outflow rate m3 s at the network outfall and total network flooding volume i e the sum of flooding volume from each node in m3 standardised by its performance relative to the baseline scenario the network outflow is also characterized using a flow duration curve i e to better understand the distribution of the flows during the 7 month period quinn et al 2021 which compares the outflow regimes of two rtc systems with a conventional rwh system without rtc in addition we assessed the water supply efficiency of the rwh systems at the catchment scale across the full range of scenarios see table 1 below to understand the specific performance gain resulting from rtc implementation flooding volume at each node in one rtc scenario e g 40 l m2 systems operated by strategy s1 was plotted against the baseline scenario moreover three of the most intense rainfall events along with one event that has the longest duration and largest rainfall depth over the simulation period were selected as illustrative examples to demonstrate peak flow reduction 3 results 3 1 network flooding volume as expected the implementation of rwh systems reduced the total network flooding volume fig 3 a conventional systems without rtc i e 0 rtc demonstrated an average of 17 flooding volume reduction compared to the baseline scenario i e 0 l m2 tank size which resulted in total flooding volume of 812 m3 the flooding volume reduction performance of these passively controlled tanks gradually increased with system capacity increasing the use of rtc further reduced the flooding risk by mitigating network flooding volume fig 3a operating all rwh system using rtc s1 i e 100 rtc reduced the network flooding volume up to 82 equipping roof areas with 10 l m2 rtc rwh systems doubled the flooding volume reduction achieved by much bigger 80 l m2 conventional rwh systems with total flooding volume of 352 and 609 m3 respectively more importantly the performance gain from increasing the proportion of controlled tanks was larger for small sized system i e less than 20 l m2 decreasing in relative terms where larger rainwater storages were used a similar trend in flooding volume reduction was modelled under the future climate across all scenarios while both the conventional and rtc demonstrated approximately 5 decrease in performance under future climate the smallest rtc system i e 5 l m2 outperformed the largest conventional system i e 80 l m2 with 29 and 21 flooding volume reduction respectively the enhanced network flooding volume reduction provided by rtc is due to the improved stormwater control at source this is illustrated by the presence of flooding volume in the upstream nodes within the baseline scenario fig 4 a retrofitting with 40 l m2 rtc system fig 4b can completely retain the flooding volume within nodes 3 and 4 while providing 88 and 77 flooding volume reduction to nodes 1 and 2 respectively mitigating a total of 665 m3 node flooding volume for the entire network during the 7 month simulation period 3 2 flow regime 3 2 1 peak flow reduction operating rwh systems by rtc with s1 was shown to effectively reduce the peak flow at the drainage network outfall like the network flooding volume reduction enhancing the proportion of rtc systems improved the peak flow reduction by up to 25 and 22 fig 3b in the current and future climates respectively increasing the storage capacity improved peak flow reduction but the gains achieved were clearly constrained by the proportion of storages operated by rtc with no gain in performance for systems size greater than 5 l m2 for passively controlled systems conversely scenarios with rtc applied to only 25 of storages saw gains in performance with incrementally larger storages real time controlled systems were also modelled to mitigate peak flow in large rainfall events table 2 the flood mitigation strategy s1 with a capacity of 40 l m2 for example was shown to reduce peak flows by 25 to 40 in the most intense events i e 9th august 27th june and 28th june events while achieving a 32 peak reduction during the largest and longest rain event i e 23rd may event which has total rainfall depth of 89 6 mm over 76 3 hr this performance was also resilient against future climate where an increasing of 15 rainfall resulted in an average loss of approximately 2 in the achieved peak flow reduction 3 2 2 outflow characterisation the outflows of two of the modelled rtc scenarios were characterized for illustration by a flow duration curve with a comparison to the conventional systems fig 5 both rtc systems demonstrated similar performance in reducing the magnitude and flashness of high flows compared to the conventional system especially for the highest flow q5 observed less than 5 of the time however the rtc release using s2 longest discharge strategy was able to better attenuate the flows especially for q5 q60 fig 5 the flood mitigation strategy s1 showed higher flows during q5 q20 but with a sudden decrease towards low flow levels in contrast the longest discharge strategy s2 generally produced more muted high flows decreasing more gradually i e lower rate of change until the turning point occurred later at q60 this gives a more constant overall flow regime 3 3 water supply water supply performance was similar for both rtc strategies being somewhat lower than that of conventional systems indeed rtc flood protection demonstrated an average of 74 21 supply efficiency across all scenarios compared to 94 5 3 in conventional systems the decrease in efficiency is relatively larger in small sized systems e g 5 and 10 l m2 diminishing in large systems e g 80 l m2 where the difference is generally less than 2 4 discussion 4 1 impact of rtc increasing the proportion of rwh storages controlled by rtc dramatically improved the performance in terms of peak flow and flooding volume reduction this can also be achieved by increasing storage capacity although a diminishing marginal return occurred when the capacity of the rtc systems exceeded 20 l m2 the magnitude of performance gained from increasing rtc proportion was relatively greater than simply increase tank capacity this observation confirmed that implementation of rtc can make the most of each rwh storage through adaptive management of its capacity improving retention of runoff thus reducing network flooding while maintaining water supply performance although the pre storm release could reduce the security in storage for supply rtc rwh systems have the potential to deliver significant cost savings systems operated by rtc can be built at a smaller size while delivering the same level of service as a larger conventional design doing so can help to reduce the overall cost especially in high density urban environments where space is limited i e insufficient space or high cost for large tanks similarly retrofitting of rtc to existing rwh storages will improve their performance reducing flood risk of the stormwater network without requiring replacement of existing storages increasing storage volume improved peak flow reduction but in conventional storages this occurred only for increases up to around 20 l m2 above that any gain was very small this is because regardless of storage volume the limited water demand means that these tanks remain near full most of the time jones hunt 2010 implementation of rtc overcomes this limitation the rtc systems can better mitigate the peak flow by proactively emptying the storage through the pre storm releases it offers flexibility to create the necessary capacity in real time allowing rtc rwh systems to better reduce the storm runoff at its source prior to the pipe network thus potentially reducing flooding risks for the downstream receiving waters this adaptive approach could also be extended to reduce the risks of combined sewer overflows cso which pose a major hazard to urban water environment ellis hvitved jacobsen 1996 passerat et al 2011 real time control can also be applied to decentralised and centralised stormwater systems that include storage to create resilience in urban drainage networks and cope with increasing impervious runoff caused by changing land use and climate change allowing high cost infrastructure upgrades to be postponed or avoided in theory the maximum peak flow reduction in this study is approximately 40 given that the rwh storages are limited to only control the runoff from roof surfaces which occupies around 40 of the total impervious areas therefore the impact of rtc on the drainage network is constrained by the extent of its application this will likely occur in practical implementation given that rwh systems are generally utilised to manage roof runoff only campisano et al 2017 with ground level runoff being unaffected future work could be undertaken to test approaches to circumvent this physical constraint for example by coupling the rtc rwh systems with other stormwater control measures scms e g biofilters shen et al 2019 and detention basin shishegar et al 2019 real time control could be applied to this network of scms indeed rtc technology is increasingly applied in both nature based and storage based scms with growing interest in investigating the mechanisms and benefits on the collaborative operation of multiple systems at a range of geographical scales di matteo et al 2019 liang et al 2021 mullapudi et al 2018 however maintaining the ecological integrity of an aquatic ecosystem requires not only alleviation of peak flow but restoration of a flow regime as close as possible to its natural pre urbanisation state poff et al 1997 doing so requires consideration of various aspects of the flow regime including magnitude frequency timing duration and flashiness therefore while both developed rtc strategies successfully reduced the magnitude of peak performing the pre storm releases over a longer period at a lower rate as occurred in s2 longest discharge was far more effective in delivering a flow regime more typical of pre urban conditions this outcome also has the benefit of minimising the hydraulic disturbance and subsequent erosion of downstream channels hawley et al 2013 russell et al 2020 4 2 implementation at catchment scale recent advances in low cost sensor technology enable the real time monitoring of environmental conditions e g water level in stormwater networks and streamflow and system dynamics e g water level in the tanks and actuator status providing a feasible and affordable solution for large scale deployment cherqui et al 2019 montserrat et al 2013 shi et al 2021 the collected data can be transmitted via innovative communication technology such as low power wide area networks lpwan which is characterised by low energy consumption and high transmission ranges silva et al 2017 such a technique has begun to be applied in operating multiple site scale rtc rwh systems powered by solar panels and batteries at catchment scale oberascher et al 2021 further gains can likely be made through the integration of sensor data and online hydrodynamic models to improve the network performance of rtc rwh systems bartos kerkez 2021 one important driver of implementation relates to the costs and benefits of rtc rwh systems while the cost of such system is context specific several studies have concluded that rainwater storages retrofitted by rtc technology is a more cost effective solution when broader criteria such as flood control and environmental benefits are considered melville shreeve et al 2016 parker et al 2022 additional benefits could also be obtained from the coordinated control of multiple rainwater storages at network scale given the synergies it can provide xu et al 2022 future research is needed to evaluate the costs and benefit of more complex rtc schemes in specific regulatory and infrastructure contexts 4 3 future research future research is required to investigate the effectiveness of control strategies which permit the spatially distributed rwh systems to collaborate across the catchment this could be achieved by optimisation based control although doing so will require overcoming the computational challenges associated with running optimisation and hydraulic models in real time the performance of such control could also be compared with simpler rule based control as simplicity of implementation will be helpful in opening up the benefits of rtc to a wider range of actors future areas of research should also include a closed loop control where real time monitoring data e g water level in each drainage node could provide feed back to improve the control strategy minimising the impacts of uncertainties in weather forecast and system dynamics another area of future work could be to propagate the sort of 1 d hydraulic modelling carried out here with a 2 d flood model even more complex feedback loops could be investigated if modelling both 1 and 2 d domains 5 conclusion in this study we modelled the impact of at source rtc rwh systems on the behaviour of a stormwater network through the integration of a rtc model in r software and a 1 d hydraulic model in swmm two different rtc strategies one for mitigating floods the other aimed at delivering a more natural flow regime were tested across a range of system settings under two climate scenarios current and future climates we concluded that the use of rtc can substantially reduce the network flooding volume and peak flow in both current and future climates and mitigate the risks of urban flooding while providing a decentralised water supply implementing higher proportions of rtc systems provided larger relative benefits than simply increasing the storage capacity of rwh systems moreover the rtc systems fundamentally modified the flow regimes of the network outflow which reveals a promising potential in reducing erosion and restoring pre development flow regimes in receiving waters our study suggests that rtc storages distributed throughout a stormwater network can substantially improve its performance potentially avoiding or deferring expensive sewer network upgrades investments in rtc technology would appear to be more promising than investments in detention volume alone credit authorship contribution statement wei d xu

2834,real time control rtc technology is increasingly applied in rainwater harvesting rwh systems to optimise their performance related to water supply and flood mitigation however most studies to date have focussed on testing the benefits at an individual site scale leaving the potential benefits for downstream stormwater networks largely untested in this study we developed a methodology to predict how at source rtc rwh systems influence the behaviour of a stormwater network simulation was enabled by coupling the drainage model in swmm with an rtc rwh model coded using the r software we modelled two different rtc strategies across a range of system settings e g storage size for rwh and proportion of storage to which rtc is applied under two different climate scenarios current and future climates the simulations showed that rtc reduced flooding volume and peak flow of the stormwater network leading to a potential mitigation of urban flooding risks while also providing a decentralised supplementary water supply implementing rtc in more of rwh storages yielded greater benefits than simply increasing storage capacity in both current and future climates more importantly the rtc systems are capable of more precisely managing the resultant flow regime in reducing the erosion and restoring the pre development conditions in sensitive receiving waters our study suggests that rtc rwh storages distributed throughout a catchment can substantially improve the performance of existing drainage systems potentially avoiding or deferring expensive network upgrades investments

mitigation source control climate change data availability i have shared the link to my data and code in the supplementary file 1 introduction urbanisation creates critical challenges for water management water scarcity caused by population growth and dwindling freshwater resources is still a major social and economic challenge in many cities vörösmarty et al 2010 urban flooding risks are increased by the excessive surface runoff and intensified peak flow which result from increased impervious areas in conventional stormwater drainage networks jongman et al 2012 nirupama and simonovic 2006 these conventional stormwater networks which aim to drain stormwater in the quickest possible time through hydraulically efficient infrastructure e g pipes also connect impervious runoff directly to the receiving water grossly altering natural flow regimes through increased frequency and magnitude of stormwater flow bhaskar et al 2016 leopold 1968 along with reduced recession times burns et al 2005 and stream baseflow booth and jackson 1997 price 2011 such hydrological changes cause substantial channel erosion hammer 1972 russell et al 2020 habitat loss and ecological degradation in urban streams with subsequent reduction in biodiversity and ecosystem services bunn arthington 2002 king et al 2005 poff et al 1997 walsh et al 2012 rainwater harvesting systems rwh are widely used as a traditional source of primary or supplementary water supply gardner and vieritz 2010 mikkelsen et al 1999 ward et al 2012 they also act as a stormwater control measure scm capturing and storing the runoff from impervious surfaces e g roofs which is then diverted to supply household end uses such a design provides complementary retention to reduce the volume frequency and peak of urban runoff which can reduce stormwater network overflows and mitigate urban flooding risks burns et al 2015 jamali et al 2019 schubert et al 2017 such systems offer benefits in potentially delaying the upgrade of water supply and drainage infrastructure coombes kuczera 2003 although the extent of benefit depends strongly on their storage capacity and characteristics of the household water demand campisano and modica 2016 application of real time control rtc technology has the potential to enhance rwh performance in relation to both water supply and flood mitigation roman et al 2017 xu et al 2020a real time control is a collection of software sensors communication devices and actuators bennett 1994 which can be combined to provide rwh systems with digital information e g rainfall forecast and adapt its operation in real time in response to operating conditions doing so allows rwh systems to evolve from their conventional static nature to highly adaptive kerkez et al 2016 real time controlled rwh systems generally release stored rainwater prior to a rainfall event termed here as pre storm releases through a remotely controlled discharge structure to proactively create sufficient capacity for the predicted inflows thus minimizing the magnitude and frequency of uncontrolled overflows a range of modelling and empirical studies have demonstrated that rtc outperforms conventional rwh systems in stormwater retention and peak flow reduction gee and hunt 2016 oberascher et al 2019 roman et al 2017 with no meaningful impact on water supply performance melville shreeve et al 2016 xu et al 2018 real time control application to rainwater has advanced in recent times to include the use of longer rainfall forecast windows xu et al 2020b modelled three different rtc strategies using a 7 day lead precipitation forecast they found that increasing the rainfall forecast window which extends the predictive horizon of the pre storm releases resulted in a better attenuation of the peak flow this approach also reduced overflow frequency and extended the recession time leading to an rtc outflow regime much closer to that of natural streams xu et al 2020b such an approach could potentially counteract the negative hydrologic impacts caused by urbanisation leopold 1968 poff et al 2010 the focus of rtc application to rwh systems to date has mainly been on the effectiveness at the land parcel leaving its impacts on stormwater networks largely untested xu et al 2020a understanding whether the benefits gained at each parcel can be accumulated and translated to a larger scale such as the catchment is vital to understand the potential cost effectiveness of rtc rwh systems for adapting to a changing climate this requires explicit consideration of the behaviour of a distributed network of rtc rwh systems and the hydraulic behaviour of the stormwater network in this study we evaluated the impact of at source rtc rwh systems on the behaviour of a stormwater network we adopted two different rtc strategies to i mitigate floods and ii deliver a more natural overall flow regime for further details see xu et al 2020b and modelled their impact on a stormwater network across a range of system settings under two different climate scenarios i e current and future climates during a 7 month simulation period network flooding volume and peak flow reduction were characterised with a more detailed analysis on the network outflow regime we hypothesised that operating rwh systems using rtc could reduce flooding volume and peak flow for a stormwater network in both current and future climates which could mitigate the risks of urban flooding while providing a decentralised supplementary water supply our results demonstrated that implementing higher proportions of rtc systems provided larger benefits than simply increasing the storage capacity potentially avoiding or deferring expensive upgrades for stormwater infrastructure our work provides useful insights for application of at source rtc rwh systems in future smart stormwater management 2 methods to predict the impact of rtc rwh systems on the performance of a stormwater network we used a modelling approach which combined outputs from a volumetric rtc rwh behaviour model coded in r software version 4 1 r core team 2021 with the 1 d hydraulic model in the stormwater management model swmm version 5 1 executed by pcswmm 7 4 rossman 2015 a similar modelling tool is also available in python as an integrated library pyswmm mcdonnell et al 2020 the steps are illustrated in fig 1 and details are given below the analysis was undertaken on a stormwater network located in a city in the province of quebec in canada for which the swmm model was adapted from shishegar et al 2021 rwh systems were assumed to only connect to roofs while stormwater runoff from other surfaces e g pavement was conveyed directly to the drainage network 2 1 rtc strategies we adopted two rtc strategies as per xu et al 2020b strategy s1 flood mitigation was designed to minimise storage overflows and strategy s2 longest discharge was designed to attenuate the flashiness and magnitude of pre storm releases to return to a more natural flow regime in strategy s1 overflows predicted to occur within the next seven days are released uniformly over the next 24 hr window in contrast strategy s2 aims to achieve the longest possible duration for each pre storm release i e the pre storm releases start seven days in advance and finish before the predicted rain both rtc strategies are based on 7 day lead rainfall forecast with the forecast assumed to be perfect i e no forecast error was modelled as the forecast error has little impact on overall system performance when a 7 day rolling horizon is applied see more details in section 2 2 2 shishegar et al 2021 2 2 modelling procedure a modelling procedure fig 1 was developed to test the performance of the proposed rtc system this procedure includes three different modules rainfall runoff module m1 rtc module m2 and drainage simulation module m3 m1 utilises a hydrological model providing the 6 min catchment runoff and daily runoff forecast as input to m2 m2 generates the outflow from each at source rtc system using the pre defined control strategies as explained in section 2 1 which is then used by m3 to model the flow dynamics in the stormwater network m1 and m3 were enabled by swmm while m2 was computed by a custom written rtc algorithm in r software 2 2 1 m1 rainfall runoff module in m1 two distinct runoff sources were generated the roof runoff used as the inflow to the rwh system and the surface runoff from the remaining surfaces of the catchment both were simulated by the rainfall runoff model in swmm see more details in section 2 3 study catchment using real rainfall data roof runoff was modelled separately from other land uses i e pavement and pervious areas because the rtc rwh behaviour cannot be implemented directly in swmm the prediction and control of the rtc systems were therefore run in the rtc module m2 roof areas were obtained by mapping each individual household and were grouped by each catchment boundary i e each catchment had one integrated roof area the imperviousness of roofs was assumed to be 100 and with a depression storage of 1 5 mm american society of civil engineers 1992 the imperviousness of each catchment for other surfaces e g pavement and pervious area was then recalculated to exclude the area of roof catchment based on the mapping of the study catchment 2 2 2 m2 real time control module the rtc module m2 determines the pre storm releases through control variables and simulates the performance of rtc systems under different strategies it consists of three steps in the first step rwh prediction operating at a daily time step anticipates system overflows for rtc decision making using the rainwater harvesting behaviour model eqs 1 3 yield after spillage rules were applied to provide a more accurate estimation of yield fewkes butler 2000 equation 1 system inflow was predicted prior to the actual events using a 7 day runoff forecast extracted from the output of m1 the forecast is updated every 24 h overflows are considered as unregulated i e they occurred whenever the maximum capacity is exceeded first flush diversion system was excluded from the model given that the use type and volumetric behaviour of filtration devices if present is highly variable 1 q o i t m a x v i t 1 q a i t s i 0 2 y i t m i n d i t v i t 1 q b i t 3 v i t m i n v i t 1 q a i t y i t q b i t s i y

timestep from tank i at time t q a i t is the system i inflow at time t l timestep n t represents the set of tanks in the second step pre storm release plans are developed to minimize the system overflows based on the developed strategies the overflow volume predicted for the rtc system corresponds to all roof surfaces connected to rtc rwh systems see more details in section 2 3 in the third step the rwh simulation fig 1 models the performance of defined controls using the rwh behaviour model equations 1 3 while the process is similar to rwh prediction this step is run on a 6 min time step to capture system inflow and outflow dynamics it utilised continuous simulation assuming that all systems were empty at the beginning of the entire simulation period meaning that this initial condition will not reset at each event finally outflows i e pre storm releases and any overflows from each system are summed and fed into the drainage simulation module m3 prediction and simulation components are operated on a 7 day rolling horizon this setting also known as receding horizon has been used in the model predictive control of urban drainage systems lund et al 2018 rwh prediction decides the rtc plan for the next 7 day period given its ability to inform controlled releases long before the actual event xu et al 2020b however only the actions in the first 24 hour period of that rolling horizon are implemented in the rwh simulation component which is then renewed recursively on a daily basis when forecast information is updated this approach creates the possibility to account for forecast errors which typically decrease as the forecast window decreases to minimise the impact of these errors on system performance 2 2 3 m3 drainage simulation module combining r and swmm model the drainage simulation module m3 based on swmm aims to model the impact of rtc and rwh systems on flow dynamics in stormwater networks outflow time series data from m2 are fed into each catchment node as external inflow representing the flow from roof areas each roof area is set to be 0 imperviousness with depression storages of 99 mm to ensure zero runoff is produced in the hydrological model as the roof runoff is being modelled by m1 finally model results such as total flooding volume and network outflow are stored and evaluated using a range of assessment metrics see section 2 4 2 3 study catchment the study area is a small urban district with primarily residential land use located in a mid size municipality in the province of quebec canada it is approximately 7 3 ha in area with an average imperviousness of 45 9 and includes 70 houses with an average roof area of 188 8 m2 the swmm model of the drainage network was adapted from shishegar et al 2021 fig 2 the study catchment is drained to a combined sewer system with limited capacity with recorded flooding issues in upstream nodes for this study a separate stormwater system is assumed by excluding the wastewater flow i e set as zero the study catchment consists of 10 subcatchments with an average slope of 2 10 nodes and 10 pipes with diameters varying from 200 mm upstream to 600 mm downstream rainfall observations adopted from shishegar et al 2021 were obtained from a rain gauge near the study stormwater network latitude 46 01 00 n longitude 71 57 00 w environment and climate change canada 2021 an individual rain event was defined as having more than 0 2 mm of rainfall with an antecedent dry period of 6 hr in total 77 rain events were exacted from a 7 month period i e 1st april to 31st oct 2013 with total precipitation of 796 4 mm a domestic water demand profile was adopted from local authority data ministry of municipal affairs and housing 2020 which indicates a daily water consumption of 275 l person day a population of 2 1 person per household was assumed according to the census in the nearby catchment statistics canada 2017 rwh systems were assumed to supply toilet flushing which counts for 30 of the domestic demand with two peak usages at 9 am and 7 pm in the diurnal pattern leading to 173 3 l day for each household although such supply has not been implemented in this study catchment it is commonly used in many countries such as australia europe and america reflecting the general use of rainwater harvesting systems campisano et al 2017 2 4 scenarios and input data a range of scenarios were designed to test the impact of rtc system settings on network performance we considered five rainwater storage capacities relative to the roof areas i e 5 10 20 40 80 l m2 and five different storage capacities to which rtc is applied e g 100 represents all rwh systems are operated by rtc all of these were compared to a baseline scenario i e no rwh system two climate conditions current and future were applied to evaluate the performance of the proposed rtc strategies in the context of climate change future rainfall is projected by adding a fixed factor of 15 to all rainfall data values this simple approach has been adopted by previous studies in the southern québec region bilodeau et al 2018 shishegar et al 2021 although future increases in rainfall intensities are likely in reality to vary by region season ouranos 2015 and return period of rainfall events mailhot et al 2012 2 5 assessment metrics two metrics were adopted to quantitatively evaluate the impact of rtc rwh systems on the drainage network performance namely peak flow and flooding volume reduction table 1 these metrics were both assessed at the catchment scale and quantify respectively the maximum outflow rate m3 s at the network outfall and total network flooding volume i e the sum of flooding volume from each node in m3 standardised by its performance relative to the baseline scenario the network outflow is also characterized using a flow duration curve i e to better understand the distribution of the flows during the 7 month period quinn et al 2021 which compares the outflow regimes of two rtc systems with a conventional rwh system without rtc in addition we assessed the water supply efficiency of the rwh systems at the catchment scale across the full range of scenarios see table 1 below to understand the specific performance gain resulting from rtc implementation flooding volume at each node in one rtc scenario e g 40 l m2 systems operated by strategy s1 was plotted against the baseline scenario moreover three of the most intense rainfall events along with one event that has the longest duration and largest rainfall depth over the simulation period were selected as illustrative examples to demonstrate peak flow reduction 3 results 3 1 network flooding volume as expected the implementation of rwh systems reduced the total network flooding volume fig 3 a conventional systems without rtc i e 0 rtc demonstrated an average of 17 flooding volume reduction compared to the baseline scenario i e 0 l m2 tank size which resulted in total flooding volume of 812 m3 the flooding volume reduction performance of these passively controlled tanks gradually increased with system capacity increasing the use of rtc further reduced the flooding risk by mitigating network flooding volume fig 3a operating all rwh system using rtc s1 i e 100 rtc reduced the network flooding volume up to 82 equipping roof areas with 10 l m2 rtc rwh systems doubled the flooding volume reduction achieved by much bigger 80 l m2 conventional rwh systems with total flooding volume of 352 and 609 m3 respectively more importantly the performance gain from increasing the proportion of controlled tanks was larger for small sized system i e less than 20 l m2 decreasing in relative terms where larger rainwater storages were used a similar trend in flooding volume reduction was modelled under the future climate across all scenarios while both the conventional and rtc demonstrated approximately 5 decrease in performance under future climate the smallest rtc system i e 5 l m2 outperformed the largest conventional system i e 80 l m2 with 29 and 21 flooding volume reduction respectively the enhanced network flooding volume reduction provided by rtc is due to the improved stormwater control at source this is illustrated by the presence of flooding volume in the upstream nodes within the baseline scenario fig 4 a retrofitting with 40 l m2 rtc system fig 4b can completely retain the flooding volume within nodes 3 and 4 while providing 88 and 77 flooding volume reduction to nodes 1 and 2 respectively mitigating a total of 665 m3 node flooding volume for the entire network during the 7 month simulation period 3 2 flow regime 3 2 1 peak flow reduction operating rwh systems by rtc with s1 was shown to effectively reduce the peak flow at the drainage network outfall like the network flooding volume reduction enhancing the proportion of rtc systems improved the peak flow reduction by up to 25 and 22 fig 3b in the current and future climates respectively increasing the storage capacity improved peak flow reduction but the gains achieved were clearly constrained by the proportion of storages operated by rtc with no gain in performance for systems size greater than 5 l m2 for passively controlled systems conversely scenarios with rtc applied to only 25 of storages saw gains in performance with incrementally larger storages real time controlled systems were also modelled to mitigate peak flow in large rainfall events table 2 the flood mitigation strategy s1 with a capacity of 40 l m2 for example was shown to reduce peak flows by 25 to 40 in the most intense events i e 9th august 27th june and 28th june events while achieving a 32 peak reduction during the largest and longest rain event i e 23rd may event which has total rainfall depth of 89 6 mm over 76 3 hr this performance was also resilient against future climate where an increasing of 15 rainfall resulted in an average loss of approximately 2 in the achieved peak flow reduction 3 2 2 outflow characterisation the outflows of two of the modelled rtc scenarios were characterized for illustration by a flow duration curve with a comparison to the conventional systems fig 5 both rtc systems demonstrated similar performance in reducing the magnitude and flashness of high flows compared to the conventional system especially for the highest flow q5 observed less than 5 of the time however the rtc release using s2 longest discharge strategy was able to better attenuate the flows especially for q5 q60 fig 5 the flood mitigation strategy s1 showed higher flows during q5 q20 but with a sudden decrease towards low flow levels in contrast the longest discharge strategy s2 generally produced more muted high flows decreasing more gradually i e lower rate of change until the turning point occurred later at q60 this gives a more constant overall flow regime 3 3 water supply water supply performance was similar for both rtc strategies being somewhat lower than that of conventional systems indeed rtc flood protection demonstrated an average of 74 21 supply efficiency across all scenarios compared to 94 5 3 in conventional systems the decrease in efficiency is relatively larger in small sized systems e g 5 and 10 l m2 diminishing in large systems e g 80 l m2 where the difference is generally less than 2 4 discussion 4 1 impact of rtc increasing the proportion of rwh storages controlled by rtc dramatically improved the performance in terms of peak flow and flooding volume reduction this can also be achieved by increasing storage capacity although a diminishing marginal return occurred when the capacity of the rtc systems exceeded 20 l m2 the magnitude of performance gained from increasing rtc proportion was relatively greater than simply increase tank capacity this observation confirmed that implementation of rtc can make the most of each rwh storage through adaptive management of its capacity improving retention of runoff thus reducing network flooding while maintaining water supply performance although the pre storm release could reduce the security in storage for supply rtc rwh systems have the potential to deliver significant cost savings systems operated by rtc can be built at a smaller size while delivering the same level of service as a larger conventional design doing so can help to reduce the overall cost especially in high density urban environments where space is limited i e insufficient space or high cost for large tanks similarly retrofitting of rtc to existing rwh storages will improve their performance reducing flood risk of the stormwater network without requiring replacement of existing storages increasing storage volume improved peak flow reduction but in conventional storages this occurred only for increases up to around 20 l m2 above that any gain was very small this is because regardless of storage volume the limited water demand means that these tanks remain near full most of the time jones hunt 2010 implementation of rtc overcomes this limitation the rtc systems can better mitigate the peak flow by proactively emptying the storage through the pre storm releases it offers flexibility to create the necessary capacity in real time allowing rtc rwh systems to better reduce the storm runoff at its source prior to the pipe network thus potentially reducing flooding risks for the downstream receiving waters this adaptive approach could also be extended to reduce the risks of combined sewer overflows cso which pose a major hazard to urban water environment ellis hvitved jacobsen 1996 passerat et al 2011 real time control can also be applied to decentralised and centralised stormwater systems that include storage to create resilience in urban drainage networks and cope with increasing impervious runoff caused by changing land use and climate change allowing high cost infrastructure upgrades to be postponed or avoided in theory the maximum peak flow reduction in this study is approximately 40 given that the rwh storages are limited to only control the runoff from roof surfaces which occupies around 40 of the total impervious areas therefore the impact of rtc on the drainage network is constrained by the extent of its application this will likely occur in practical implementation given that rwh systems are generally utilised to manage roof runoff only campisano et al 2017 with ground level runoff being unaffected future work could be undertaken to test approaches to circumvent this physical constraint for example by coupling the rtc rwh systems with other stormwater control measures scms e g biofilters shen et al 2019 and detention basin shishegar et al 2019 real time control could be applied to this network of scms indeed rtc technology is increasingly applied in both nature based and storage based scms with growing interest in investigating the mechanisms and benefits on the collaborative operation of multiple systems at a range of geographical scales di matteo et al 2019 liang et al 2021 mullapudi et al 2018 however maintaining the ecological integrity of an aquatic ecosystem requires not only alleviation of peak flow but restoration of a flow regime as close as possible to its natural pre urbanisation state poff et al 1997 doing so requires consideration of various aspects of the flow regime including magnitude frequency timing duration and flashiness therefore while both developed rtc strategies successfully reduced the magnitude of peak performing the pre storm releases over a longer period at a lower rate as occurred in s2 longest discharge was far more effective in delivering a flow regime more typical of pre urban conditions this outcome also has the benefit of minimising the hydraulic disturbance and subsequent erosion of downstream channels hawley et al 2013 russell et al 2020 4 2 implementation at catchment scale recent advances in low cost sensor technology enable the real time monitoring of environmental conditions e g water level in stormwater networks and streamflow and system dynamics e g water level in the tanks and actuator status providing a feasible and affordable solution for large scale deployment cherqui et al 2019 montserrat et al 2013 shi et al 2021 the collected data can be transmitted via innovative communication technology such as low power wide area networks lpwan which is characterised by low energy consumption and high transmission ranges silva et al 2017 such a technique has begun to be applied in operating multiple site scale rtc rwh systems powered by solar panels and batteries at catchment scale oberascher et al 2021 further gains can likely be made through the integration of sensor data and online hydrodynamic models to improve the network performance of rtc rwh systems bartos kerkez 2021 one important driver of implementation relates to the costs and benefits of rtc rwh systems while the cost of such system is context specific several studies have concluded that rainwater storages retrofitted by rtc technology is a more cost effective solution when broader criteria such as flood control and environmental benefits are considered melville shreeve et al 2016 parker et al 2022 additional benefits could also be obtained from the coordinated control of multiple rainwater storages at network scale given the synergies it can provide xu et al 2022 future research is needed to evaluate the costs and benefit of more complex rtc schemes in specific regulatory and infrastructure contexts 4 3 future research future research is required to investigate the effectiveness of control strategies which permit the spatially distributed rwh systems to collaborate across the catchment this could be achieved by optimisation based control although doing so will require overcoming the computational challenges associated with running optimisation and hydraulic models in real time the performance of such control could also be compared with simpler rule based control as simplicity of implementation will be helpful in opening up the benefits of rtc to a wider range of actors future areas of research should also include a closed loop control where real time monitoring data e g water level in each drainage node could provide feed back to improve the control strategy minimising the impacts of uncertainties in weather forecast and system dynamics another area of future work could be to propagate the sort of 1 d hydraulic modelling carried out here with a 2 d flood model even more complex feedback loops could be investigated if modelling both 1 and 2 d domains 5 conclusion in this study we modelled the impact of at source rtc rwh systems on the behaviour of a stormwater network through the integration of a rtc model in r software and a 1 d hydraulic model in swmm two different rtc strategies one for mitigating floods the other aimed at delivering a more natural flow regime were tested across a range of system settings under two climate scenarios current and future climates we concluded that the use of rtc can substantially reduce the network flooding volume and peak flow in both current and future climates and mitigate the risks of urban flooding while providing a decentralised water supply implementing higher proportions of rtc systems provided larger relative benefits than simply increasing the storage capacity of rwh systems moreover the rtc systems fundamentally modified the flow regimes of the network outflow which reveals a promising potential in reducing erosion and restoring pre development flow regimes in receiving waters our study suggests that rtc storages distributed throughout a stormwater network can substantially improve its performance potentially avoiding or deferring expensive sewer network upgrades investments in rtc technology would appear to be more promising than investments in detention volume alone credit authorship contribution statement wei d xu
