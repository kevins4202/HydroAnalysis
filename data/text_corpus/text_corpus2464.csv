12320,the present work investigated the degradation behavior of chloramphenicol chpl drug at a high concentration in the uv tio2 photocatalytic uvpc process to compare the performance of cleavage of chpl molecule and total organic carbon toc reduction the reduction in toc was mostly resulted from the cleavage of c c homolytic bond which was in the accordance of lc ms spectra the toc removal was trailed by 23 19 than chpl with 100 mgl 1 using tio2 1 25 gl 1 ph 3 and irradiation time of 45 min the mechanistic routes of chpl decomposition in the uvpc process are proposed and its synergy in the fenton oxidation process is also explored total seven intermediates appeared in the mass spectra within the mass to charge ratio of 100 400 the proposed mechanism implied that intermediates were mostly originated by the decomposition of amide chain of chpl molecule the antimicrobial activity of chpl towards the inactivation of e coli xl 10gold was decreased by 67 4 after 45 min of decomposition graphical abstract fx1 keywords photocatalysis drug decomposition total organic carbon antimicrobial activity 1 introduction antibiotic drugs are over administered in developing countries like india the contamination of both surface water and land due to the presence of such drugs is a serious concern of this century antibiotic drugs show poor biodegradability and toxic effects they could contribute to the development of antibiotic resistant bacteria mostly in the aquatic environment liu et al 2009 podder et al 2018 the municipal wastewater treatment plants have been identified as a primary source for the introduction of antibiotics in the aquatic environment having the limitations of poor removal efficiency for these types of compounds thus the antibiotics and their metabolites continuously are entering into the environment parsley et al 2010 chloramphenicol chpl is an antibiotic drug which is effective against both gram positive and gram negative bacteria it acts through the inhibition of the synthesis of protein by the microorganism chpl is banned for its use in food producing animals in the european union and in many other countries including usa canada australia japan and china as it could develop plastic anemia in humans wongtavatchai et al 2004 a monitoring study focusing on the detection of veterinary drugs in manure groundwater soil and

streams parsley et al 2010 new and cost effective technology is a global need for the effective degradation of pharmaceutically active compounds phacs present in water there are many successful stories for the treatment of phacs wastewater by the advanced oxidation processes aops hapeshi et al 2010 elmolla et al 2010 photocatalysis is regarded as one of the important processes for the elimination of phacs present in surface water the heterogeneous semiconductor photocatalysis using tio2 is found be capable of achieving complete oxidation of pollutants through the generation of hydroxyl radicals ho and or valence band vb holes h created when the catalyst is exposed to uv irradiation petala et al 2006 fujishima et al 2008 the high electron hole pair recombination rate controls photocatalytic efficiency the literature on the photo degradation of chpl using pure tio2 nanoparticles zhang et al 2010 is scanty when the mineralization efficiency and antimicrobial activity of treated partially treated effluent are concerned they reported a chpl decomposition efficiency of 85 9 near the neutral ph and a second order polynomial model is used to fit the kinetic data doorslaer and co workers degraded ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin antibiotics in uv 365 nm tio2 process and the fastest degradation is obtained at ph 7 and 10 with a pseudo first order rate constant of 0 072 and 0 058 min 1 respectively doorslaer et al 2011 the cleavage of cefazolin is reported to be 53 with n doped tio2 using uv light of 365 nm gurkan et al 2012 paul et al 2010 reported an inhibition of growth of e coli by 50 after 8 of uv light irradiation using tio2 catalyst so the main aims of this study are to i evaluate the performance of uv photocatalysis uvpc for the decomposition of chpl molecule and its effectiveness for toc reduction and ii identify the degradation products when chpl decomposition was almost invariant the proposed mechanism showed the detailed pathways of chpl cleavage and release of co2 leading to toc reduction in fact the photocatalysis using tio2 and fenton oxidation processes have the common characteristic feature of the generation of ho radicals so it could be anticipated that both the processes should follow the similar pathways for the cleavage of drugs organic molecules the mechanism of chpl cleavage in the uv tio2 photocatalytic uvpc process is studied in order to understand the synergy in the mechanism of chpl decomposition with the fenton oxidation process giri and golder 2014 moreover the antimicrobial activity of chpl and its intermediate products were studied using e coli 2 material and methods 2 1 materials chpl 99 w w was procured from sigma aldrich china the molecular structure and typical

thereafter the faster initial rate i e within the initial linear period of toc removal was resulted from the mineralization of amide chain kavitha and palanivelu 2004 the opening and mineralization of the substituted benzene ring took place in the second stage the decay in the concentration of chpl was around 23 7 chpl in the absence of catalyst but under the uv light irradiation of 45 min at ph 3 and insignificant toc removal was observed in dark there was only 2 3 chpl removal in the presence of the catalyst fig 2 the highest chpl and toc removal were found to be 93 8 and 68 9 respectively fig 2 the lower toc removal is attributable to the formation of refractory intermediates of lower molecular weight as detailed in section 3 2 it is important to mention here that the half life of an acidic solution of chpl at ph 3 0 and 25 c is around 2 h with a constant ionic strength of 0 1 however with the addition of cl ions the half life of the hydrolysis reaction increases significantly

decarbonisation what types of pathways with low errors 0 19 to 0 53 gmol 1 between the proposed mass and exact mass and total nine intermediate products appeared in mass spectra a synergy in uvpc and fenton oxidation processes for the mechanism of chpl degradation was observed due to have the common characteristic feature of ho radicals generation proposed degradation mechanism evidences a significant toc reduction which was resulted from decarboxylation reaction releasing co2 growth of e coli was completely inhibited in the presence of 100 mgl 1 chpl mostly owing to no2 compounds and

12321,the influence of ph on the leaching behaviours of as cd cu mo ni pb se and zn from a lead smelter slag was assessed to understand the ground water pollution potential of slag and the toxicity in geo environmental conditions leaching of slag was investigated by using european en 12457 2 and pren 14429 leaching tests the results obtained from pren 14429 leaching test were used to determine the acid neutralization capacity anc of slag the ph dependent leaching results were further assessed by considering existing geo chemical modeling results of similar types of wastes results indicate that the concentrations of some toxic metal and metalloid species in the leachate are higher than their specified limits prescribed for safe landfill disposal as inert or non reactive hazardous solid waste as well as for safe disposal of effluent in inland surface water the anc values obtained for slag at ph values 7 5 and 4 are 0 75 meqv g 3 72 meqv g and 37 30 meqv g respectively the low anc values as well as the high concentrations of majority of the toxic elements in leachates especially at the ph range of 5 7 indicate hazardous nature of slag for disposal under open atmosphere the leaching behaviours of iron and calcium under varying ph conditions have profound effect on the ph dependent mobilities of most of the trace elements present in the slag the sodium potassium and chloride leaching from slag particularly in the ph range of 4 12 are ph independent and therefore do not have any effect on the mobilities of toxic elements graphical abstract fx1 keywords lead smelter slag heavy metals ph dependent leaching water pollution waste management 1 introduction various types of solid wastes are generated from municipalities and several industrial processes these wastes are categorized based on their properties such as material types hazard potentials or based on their origins e g organic inorganic considering hazard potentials these wastes can be classified into two types inert e g glass bottles excavated soil building and demolition waste and hazardous waste with high concentrations of heavy metals and toxic organic compounds such as nonferrous slags fly ash and apc residue generated in municipality solid waste incineration plants however regardless of the type hazard potential or origin the effective managements of solid wastes are important tasks for an environmentally sound society recycling as construction materials and land filling after detoxification are the major management options for these wastes mitchell et al 1992 chandler et al 1997 ferrous and non ferrous industries are among the most important producers of solid wastes such as metallurgical slag wastes from air pollution control technology applied in these industries and various sludges produced from blast furnaces the disposal of slag after treatment or use of slag as raw materials in road construction and as aggregates in concrete preparations is the major management options of these slags hughes and halliburton 1973 vegas et al 2008 penpolcharoen 2005 morrison et al 2003 atzeni et al 1996 saikia et al 2008 2012 despite the substantial amounts of slags are generated from non ferrous metal pb zn cu ni and cr processing industries very less numbers of studies are so far conducted to use nonferrous slags as raw materials in concrete production or in road construction on the other hand slags and other wastes generated from iron processing industries are widely used in cement and concrete productions the presence of elevated levels of toxic elements like as cd pb and se may be the major reason for not considering these slags as secondary materials in various infrastructure activities the pb and zn slags are produced during pyro metallurgical treatment of sulfide ores most of the pyro metallurgical wastes or metal smelter slags are dispersed in open environment or used in road constructions without any treatment barna et al 2004 jin et al 2014 the natural weathering of slag stored in slag heap can change the mineralogy of slag sobanska et al 2016 the release of toxic elements from slags upon contact with acidic rain water can pollute the soil as well as surface and ground water of nearby locality lewis 1992 sobanska et al 2000 reuter et al 2004 the greatest concentrations of contaminant metal and metalloid species generated from nonferrous metal smelters normally observe on the nearby soil surface of slag disposal sites ettler 2016 high concentrations of some toxic elements such as cd cu pb and zn in the ground water of nearby locality of slag disposal site due to the downward migrations of toxic metal and metalloid species from surface soil were also reported de andrade lima and bernardez 2013 ettler 2016 many studies indicated that the people leaving nearby locality of non ferrous slag dumping sites were affected by the toxic trace metals such as as cd cu pb zn de andrade lima and bernardez 2013 2017 carvalho et al 2003 ettler 2016 the leaching behaviours of majority of toxic elements are dependent on the various physico chemical properties of waste materials different types of leaching tests are normally performed to assess the toxicities of wastes in landfill or other disposal conditions leaching tests are also performed to assess the potential risks of a waste to human health and or ground water tiwari et al 2015 these include some regulatory tests to evaluate the materials for specific use or disposal scenarios all the leaching tests are classified into two classes batch or static and dynamic leaching tests in batch leaching test the size reduced waste is mixed with definite volume of leaching solutions and agitated the mixture for a short period of time typically for a few hours or for a day leaching test such as european en 12457 2 or din test en 12457 3 and american toxicity characteristic leaching procedure tclp test are the examples of regulatory batch leaching tests the results obtained from these types of tests are compared with specified listed values and therefore can be used to classify wastes according to classification types i e hazardous or inert the major objective of such regulatory specification is to prevent or reduce the negative impacts on the environment in particular on soil surface water groundwater and on human health from the landfilling of waste by introducing stringent technical requirements for waste and landfills in dynamic leaching test the leachate solution is renewed after a period and continued for long term tests such as european pren 14429 test and lysimeter or column tests are the examples of dynamic leaching tests in these tests the leaching solution is under continuous flux and therefore represents the field conditions one of the important factors influencing the releases of contaminants from waste materials during leaching evaluations is ph eighmy et al 1995 kosson et al 2002 krol and mizerna 2016 vitkova et al 2009 the solubility of a species from waste materials as well as the formations and precipitations of secondary minerals having contaminant species leached from wastes are normally ph dependent in other words the stability of a species in water or liquid medium can be directly related with the ph of aqueous medium and therefore the leaching behaviours of contaminant species from a waste is reflected by the ph dependence the ph dependence leaching behaviour of a waste thus provides information that can help to understand the fate and behaviour of a contaminant species in geo environmental conditions such results are often more useful than the results obtained from the analysis of total elemental composition or results obtained from simple batch leaching tests such as tclp test for assessing the environmental impacts as well as for determining the suitable management options of waste materials jarošíková et al 2017 the ph of leachates generated in leaching experiments is controlled by a number of factors e g dissolution of atmospheric co2 dissolution of minerals from wastes and secondary mineral formations to evaluate the ph effect on metal leaching a ph dependent static leaching test is commonly performed over a wide range of ph tiwari et al 2015 kosson et al 2002 this type of leaching test also provides information related to the potential buffering capacity of a waste material the test can also be used to evaluate the acid neutralization capacity of a waste cappuyns and swennen 2008 additional information can be obtained by combining the ph dependent leaching results and geochemical modeling and therefore such combination is a powerful tool to understand the solid phase speciations and reactivities of toxic metal or metalloid species in soils sediments and waste materials quina et al 2009 numerous studies have been done to understand the leaching behaviours of several types of waste materials using various types of leaching methodologies astrup et al 2006 cappuyns et al 2014 cornelis et al 2011 dijkstra et al 2006 2008 eighmy et al 1995 engstrom 2010 jarošíková et al 2017 potysz 2016 quina et al 2009 vitkova et al 2009 vitkova et al 2013 the leaching results so far obtained for various non ferrous slags indicate that the majority of the trace elements leached from slags occur at low or high ph regions and the concentrations at natural ph regions are normally low cappuyns et al 2014 cornelis et al 2011 jarošíková et al 2017 potysz 2016 yin et al 2016 factors such as minerals present in slag and atmospheric oxidative conditions during ph dependence leaching tests controls the leachings of various elements or chemical species from lead blast furnace slag and imperial smelting furnace slag cappuyns et al 2014 yin et al 2016 the geo chemical modeling of the results obtained from ph dependence leaching test coupled with the mineralogical compositions of wastes and their residues obtained after ph dependence leaching tests is a powerful tool for understanding the involved chemical processes during leaching schindler et al 2000 meima and comans 1998a hyks et al 2009 astrup et al 2006 dijkstra et al 2006 2008 quina et al 2009 cornelis et al 2011 cappuyns et al 2014 such information can be used for assessing environmental impact of waste materials as well quina et al 2009 potysz 2016 yin et al 2016 from the analysis of ph dependence leaching results of a mswi ash using geo chemical modeling software hyks et al 2009 classified elements as availability controlled solubility controlled and complexation sorption controlled quina et al 2009 used the available geo chemical modeling results of ph dependent leaching data of similar types of waste materials to explain the ph dependence leaching behaviour of mswi fly ash cornelis et al 2009 observed some striking similarities of some properties among the various types of wastes such as non ferrous slags mswi bottom ash and apc residues cornelis et al 2009 smelting of pb in a blast furnace located nearby area of antwerp belgium generates large amounts of slag the dumping of this slag in the vicinity of smelter site is an environmental threat due to presence of very high amounts of some metal and metalloid species the disposal or utilizations of lead slag in construction purposes are considered as the major sources of toxic elements such as as cu pb zn present in the soil as well as the surface and groundwater of nearby locality carvalho et al 2003 sobanska et al 2000 therefore a thorough environmental characterization procedure is necessary before considerations of pb slag for recycling or land filling purposes in our previous investigation a pb smelter slag was considered as a partial substitution of sand fraction in the preparation of cement mortar saikia et al 2008 2012 the slag met the required physical and mechanical properties for application as a partial substitution of sand fraction in cement mortar preparation however the leaching assessments of slag containing cement mortar samples by en12457 2 leaching test indicated that the concentrations of cu pb and zn in the leachate were higher than the specified limit for recycling as construction materials similarly substantial amounts of cu pb and zn were liberated when the slag containing cement mortars were subjected to nen 7345 leaching test saikia et al 2012 considering the toxicity of pb smelter slag as well as the importance of leaching tests in evaluating environmental impacts of wastes and other toxic materials on the soil surface water and groundwater in this investigation the leaching behaviours of a pb smelter slag was assessed using various standard leaching tests the toxicity of lead slag was first evaluated by using a regulatory european short term batch leaching test the ph dependent leaching curves of some toxic metal and metalloid species were eventually determined under anoxic condition by using a ph static test the interpretation of the ph dependent leaching results of toxic elements were done by using existing geo chemical modeling results reported for similar types of wastes it is envisaged that the leaching results presented in this work will be helpful for environmental impacts assessments and risk analyses of similar types of wastes too 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the metallurgical slag used in this investigation was a residue obtained from a lead blast furnace located in the nearby area of antwerp belgium after separation from the bullion the slag was cooled down and broken into finer particles the slag used in this study was a very hard and black coloured granular material having diameter in the range of 0 4 mm all the chemicals used in this investigation were ultrapure grade the ultrapure double distilled deionized milli q water with a very low conductance value was used during the investigation 2 2 characterization of slag 2 2 1 determination of chemical compositions of slag the sio2 so4 2 po4 3 and cl contents in the slag were determined by using standard gravimetric methods vogel 1961 the sulfates chlorides and phosphates were precipitated as baso4 agcl and mgnh4po4 6h2o respectively the total contents of other major and minor elements present in slag were determined by using an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrophotometer icp ms thermo elemental x series similar procedures as described in our previous communication were used to prepare samples saikia et al 2008 the liquid sample of the slag necessary for icp ms analyses was generated by acid digestion method using hno3 hclo4 and hf acids the concentrations obtained g l for most abundant species were converted into the weight percentages of the most abundant oxides for determining ph of slag a solid liquid mixture was prepared by shaking 3 g of powdered slag with 30 ml of water for 24 h using a magnetic stirrer the results presented in this work are the average values of three measurements 2 2 2 identification of minerals to identify the major crystalline components in the slag the x ray diffraction pattern of slag was recorded using a philips pw 1830 diffractometer equipped with a graphite monochromator and a gas proportional detector and using cu kα radiation minerals present in slag were identified using the diffract plus software employing the icdp pdf 2 database 2 3 leaching tests the leaching behaviour of slag was evaluated at 25 c by using european standard regulatory leaching test en 12457 2 saikia et al 2008 the en 12457 2 leaching test is a single step batch leaching test where water is used as a leaching solution the leaching is done at room temperature by using end over end agitation method with 24 h agitation time the liquid to solid ratio is maintained at 10 no clear definition is imposed on the particle size but the diameter of the particle must be less than 4 mm accordingly 15 g of powdered slag sample was mixed with 150 ml distilled deionized water in 250 ml plastic bottle the mixture was then agitated by using an electrical shaker for 24 h the pren 14429 leaching test was used to identify the leaching behaviour of slag under certain ph conditions the test consists of a set of parallel batch extractions of the sample at liquid to solid ratio of 10 ml g 1 in closed plastic containers in this investigation about 15 g samples were mixed with 150 ml aqueous solutions with increasing quantities of hno3 and naoh koh solutions in 250 ml plastic containers and agitated for 72 h using an electrical shaker the agitation was done in a thermostatic chamber to keep the shaking temperature at 20 c after completion of agitation i e leaching process the slag aqueous solution mixtures were separated into two portions a portion of the solution was used for determining the ph and conductivity and other portion was used for elemental analysis all the leaching experiments were done by using flat bottom horizontal shaker with 145 rpm shaking frequency for analyzing elemental concentrations about 100 ml of the leachate was filtered through a 0 45 m membrane filter and separated into two equal volume fractions a fraction was acidified with 1 ml of 65 hno3 acid to bring the ph 2 and kept to analyze the cations by icp ms the other fraction was directly used for analyzing the oxyanions of as mo sb se and v by icp ms and sulfate and chloride by ion chromatography all the samples were kept in a refrigerator until analyses 2 4 analysis of elemental compositions of digested slag solution and leachates 2 4 1 inductively coupled plasma mass spectrophotometric analysis the concentrations of cationic and other anionic species including silica were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrophotometry icp ms for each elemental species the average of total six determinations was reported in this investigation moreover to obtain high quality data from the leaching test several precautionary measures were taken during whole experimental period in all the measurements done by icp ms analysis ultrapure multi elemental freshly prepared standard solutions with appropriate concentrations were used for calibrations and 115in was used as an internal standard adequate numbers of blank and standard solutions were used and calibration was occasionally done for getting high quality data the flushing of rinse blank solution and nebulization of samples were done prior to the analysis of sample until a steady state signal was achieved 2 4 2 ion chromatographic determinations of sulfate and chloride the concentrations of sulfate and chloride in the leachates were measured by a reagent free ion chromatography system with eluent regeneration rfic er model dionex ics 2000 the system can measure liquid samples containing very low amounts of anions e g 5 ppb bromate in drinking water less frequent eluent preparation reduces unintentional variations in the concentrations of anions and therefore increases the reliability and reproducibility during measurements during measurements adequate numbers of blank and standard solutions were used and calibration was occasionally done for getting high quality data for each anionic species the average of three determinations was reported 3 results and discussion 3 1 chemical and mineralogical properties the major and minor elements presents in slag are presented in table 1 the major oxides present in slag are the calcium oxide iron oxide and silica the combined content of these three oxides is about 90 of total oxides present in slag the slag also contains very high amounts of zno 5 01 and pbo 2 47 cuo 0 421 along with considerable amounts of as sb cr v and se the xrd pattern of slag is presented in fig 1 the minerals identified from the xrd patterns are presented in table 2 the detail discussion about the mineralogical composition of slag was already presented in another publication saikia et al 2008 slag contains calcium iron silicates kirschstenite and calcium zinc silicates hardystonite akermanite as the major minerals with substantial amounts of sphalerite zinc sulfide and wuestite feo the presence of considerable amounts of sulfide and wuestite in the slag indicates that the pb slag was formed under reducing condition erb satullo et al 2014 the xrd analysis detects several zn containing crystalline minerals in slag whereas no pb containing crystalline minerals are present in the xrd pattern although the concentrations of both metals in slag are quite high table 1 probably the amounts of pb based crystalline minerals present in slag are below the detection limit of xrd the same observation also indicates the difference in behaviour of these elements during formation of slag because of the similarities of size of fe2 and zn2 ionic radii of fe2 and zn2 are 0 76 and 0 74 å respectively zinc can substitute the divalent fe in several types of iron silicates ettler et al 2001 for the similar reason zn can substitute mg ionic radius 0 72 å in hardystonite ca2 mg zn si2o7 too thus because of the similarities in size most of the zn are mixed with the silicates and oxide melts and therefore incorporated into the crystalline minerals on the other hand because of the larger ionic size pb ionic radius 119 å is incompatible to the above types of silicates and oxide melts and therefore does not dissolve in melts during slag formation ettler et al 2001 zn may also be present as sulfides and possibly some amounts of zn also present as metallic inclusions or in pure metallic states ettler et al 2001 3 2 analysis using en 12457 2 leaching test the concentrations of some elements in the leachate obtained from slag powder after application of european standard en 12457 2 leaching test along with the limit values specified in various standards are presented in table 3 the results were already discussed in another communication considering the flemish nen 7343 leaching limit values for recycling as a granular construction material saikia et al 2008 therefore the comparisons of results with such standard will not be considered in this investigation however the pollution potential of slag is further assessed by comparing the leaching results with a national standard specification for drinking water standard for disposal of effluents of municipal solid wastes in inland surface water and the european standard specifications for landfill acceptance criteria it should be mentioned here that the tests such as lysimeter or column leaching tests are more appropriate for comparing leaching results with the drinking water standards than the results obtained from batch leaching tests such as en 12457 2 leaching test this is because of the fact that a fraction of trace elements present in leachates are normally absorbed by the mineral surfaces during transportation of leachates through the soil layers such processes can reduce the concentrations of trace elements in the leachates therefore the data obtained from batch leaching tests such as en 12457 2 leaching test may not be appropriate to assess the toxicity of waste leachate considering drinking water standards the en 12457 2 leaching test is normally performed to classify the waste according to european landfilled directive and to determine the reusability potential of a solid waste for construction purposes although there are some limitations leaching results obtained from batch leaching tests such as synthetic precipitation leaching procedure splp are occasionally compared with drinking water standards for assessing the trace element leaching potentials of waste materials legret et al 2005 townsend et al 2003 izquierdo et al 2005 obtained comparable leaching results for various trace elements when mswi bottom ash to be used as an unbound granular material for road pavements was subjected to en 12457 2 leaching test and a column type field leaching test table 3 indicates that the concentrations of al as mo ni se and pb in the leachate generated from slag cross the standard specified limits prescribed for drinking water similarly se and pb concentrations in the leachate along with the ph of leachates do not meet the specified limits set for the respective elements for safe disposal of waste effluents in inland surface water the concentrations of se and pb in the leachates do not meet the european landfilled criteria for disposal as inert as well as non reactive hazardous wastes too thus the disposal of investigated slag in open field will severely pollute the nearby ground as well as surface water and therefore some precautions will be necessary during handling and disposal of the pb slag if we consider the total concentration it can be inferred that the concentrations of majority of the toxic elements in the leachates are quite low although their concentrations in slag are very high this indicates that the mineralogical composition influences the leaching of elements from the slag for example the concentration of pb in the leachate is quite high in comparison to the zn concentration although the zn content in the slag is almost twice the amount of pb present in slag the leaching of low amounts of zn despite the high zn content in slag can be related with the stability of zn containing minerals in slag zn is present in some crystalline silicate minerals hardystonite kirchstenite and sulfide mineral sphalerite which are quite stable in applied leaching conditions cappuyns 2014 on the other hand in slag pb is possibly present as easily leachable metallic or intermetallic state and therefore substantial amounts of pb are leached from the slag during leaching barna et al 2004 therefore from the xrd study as well as the leaching behaviour it can be concluded that pb in slag is primarily present as a metallic inclusion trapped in the amorphous glass or in crystalline forms as a pure metal or in intermetallic state or as sulfide compounds ettler et al 2001 3 3 acid neutralization capacity anc the change in ph due to the additions of different volumes of acids and bases into the slag during leaching experiments are presented in fig 2 the figure indicates initial slow increase in ph from 2 5 to 4 5 with large amounts of basicity consumptions followed by a rapid change in ph 4 5 11 8 within a very small range of acid or base consumption zone the changes in ph again slowdowns in the ph range of 11 8 13 2 with increasing base additions the slow change in ph indicates the existence of a buffering zone at high ph region considering the presence of considerable amounts of ca and si in the slag and in the leachates the carbonation and associated interaction of co2 with mineral phases like portlandite as well as the formations of calcium silicate hydrates may be the major reason for such behaviour garrabrants et al 2004 the dissolution of acidic sulfide minerals present in slag due to the addition of base can also increase the h ion concentrations and therefore decrease the ph of leachates by introducing strong acidic environment cappuyns 2014 on the other hand at low ph alkali and alkaline earth metals are liberated due to the dissolution of silicate minerals present in slag the emitted alkali and alkaline earth metals neutralize the added amounts of acids and therefore a weak buffering zone is appeared the acid neutralization capacity anc of a waste i e capacity of waste to neutralize acids is a key property to understand the long term waste behaviour in environment as the dissolutions followed by precipitations of metals are directly related with anc values the results obtained from pren 14429 leaching test can also be used to assess the acid neutralization capacity of a waste material too for this purpose the amount of acid added in ml was converted into the equivalent of acids per gram of dry waste and presented in fig 3 about 0 75 meqv g acid is necessary to reach the ph 7 while for reaching ph 5 this amount increases to 3 92 meqv g acid and for ph 4 the necessary amount of acid is 37 25 meqv g this indicates the existence of a strong buffering zone between ph 5 and 4 moreover in comparison to other waste materials such as municipal incineration ash investigated slag has very low ancph7 which is in accordance with the values reported for other non ferrous slags cornelis et al 2011 table 4 shows the anc values of slag and concentrations of a few toxic elements in leachates obtained in the ph range of 4 0 10 7 in the same table the acceptable limit values for these elements according to european directive for classifying a waste for landfilling purposes are also presented from the results it can be concluded that the addition of small amounts of acid can leached substantial amounts of toxic elements most of which are quite higher than the standard specifications for example when leaching was done by using distilled water as a leaching solution the concentrations of pb and zn in the leachate were 49 1 and 0 9 mg kg respectively and the ph of the leachate was 10 7 the leaching of slag by using 0 745 meqv g acid containing water generated a leachates having ph 7 04 the concentrations of pb and zn in the leachates were 8 4 and 194 mg kg respectively and well above the standard specified limits for disposal as inert waste in landfill the pb and zn concentrations in the leachate further increased to 3909 5 mg kg and 1451 mg kg respectively when leaching was done by using 3 72 meqv g acid containing water the ph of the leachate was also decreased to 5 07 the same behaviours can be observed for the majority of other trace elements the variation of conductivity of leachate generated from slag against the variation of ph values is presented in fig 4 the conductivities of leachates generally low in the ph range of 6 12 with a minimum at ph about 10 9 this range also corresponds to the minimum leaching region for most of the major and minor elements fig 4 also shows strong relationship between the ph dependent conductivity values of leachates with the concentrations of some major and trace elements present in the leachates the dependence of conductivity curve on the concentrations of ca fe si pb and zn also indicates that the ph dependence leaching behaviours of most of the trace elements are probably dependent on the behaviours of these elements 3 4 ph dependent leaching behaviour in order to understand the effect of ph on the leaching behaviour of toxic metal and metalloid species the experimental results of these toxic species obtained from pren 14429 leaching test were analyzed and compared with the leaching behaviour of some major elements present in the slag considering the similarities of leaching properties of alkaline wastes such as mswi bottom ash and apc residue ffc fly ash with metallurgical slags in this investigation therefore an attempt has been made to explain the leaching behaviours of toxic elements of slag by using the existing geo chemical modeling information along with the surface chemistry results for related wastes cornelis et al 2011 quina et al 2009 table 5 shows the solubility controlling mineral phases and physical processes those reported for various types of alkaline wastes the higher leachabilities of elements with increasing acidity and basicity of the leachates from neutral ph as observed from the ph dependent leaching curves indicate that most of the elements are associated with the relatively stable silicates and oxide minerals of slag cappuyns 2014 the ph dependent leaching of most of the major as well as minor metal or metalloid species exhibits a u or v shaped curves characteristics for amphoteric nature vitkova et al 2009 nilsson et al 2016 the leaching amount of each element at extreme acidic condition is more than that observed in extreme basic condition the dissolution of minerals present in slag and consequent formations of secondary mineral phases at different ph conditions are the major processes which control the ph dependent behaviour of various elements in the leachates thus at extreme high and low ph regions ph 4 and ph 13 the equilibrium concentrations of almost all investigated elements are controlled by the solubilization of elements from the slag considering the behaviours of various elements in the ph dependence leaching curves it can be concluded that the upward trend of their concentrations observed in the leaching curve indicates the dissolution of a species from minerals during leaching process on the other hand a downward trend after an upward trend indicates the precipitation of the species due to various physico chemical phenomena ettringite a hydrated calcium aluminosulfate and calcium silicate hydrate are the cement based minerals those can accommodate cations and oxyanions of as mo and se in its structure by various physico chemical processes gougar et al 1996 saikia et al 2006a these minerals are normally precipitated as secondary minerals during leaching of high calcium and silica containing wastes such as coal fly ash and control the mobilities of different toxic elements at various environmental conditions saikia et al 2006a chemical analysis indicates the presence of high amounts of cao sio2 along with the considerable amounts of al2o3 and so4 2 in the slag therefore like some other wastes these species may come into the solution due to the interaction of slag with high alkaline leaching solution and at appropriate chemical environment they can form ettringite and calcium silicate hydrate type minerals dermatas and meng 2003 the concentrations of al ca si and sulfate in the leachate at various ph are presented in fig 5 the more or less similar leaching curves of calcium and silica particularly at high ph region indicate some correlation between these two species therefore at high ph there is a strong possibility of the formation of calcium silicate hydrate type minerals due to the reaction of calcium and silica the formation of such secondary mineral surfaces also controls the leaching behaviour of several minor elements particularly at high ph region engstrom 2010 also observed the formation of calcium silicate hydrate during leaching of eaf slag having similar type of mineral composition in comparison to the behaviours of other three species presented in fig 5 sulfate concentrations in the leachate are relatively constant in the near neutral to alkaline ph zones possibly sulfate does not have any active role on the mobility of minor elements especially at high ph region and therefore the role of ettringite on the mobility of trace elements can be ruled out 3 4 1 ph dependent leaching behaviour of oxyanions fig 6 shows the ph dependent leaching behaviours of as mo and se for comparison purpose the ph dependent leaching curves of some major metal species are also included in the figure the shapes of ph dependent leaching curve of as generates a u or v shaped curve which is characteristic of an amphoteric element and in accordance with the leaching curves of pb and fe the similarities of the behaviour of pb with aso4 2 in the ph range of acidic to ph 10 8 suggest that the formation of pbaso4 and pb3 aso4 2 may be the major solubility controlling minerals for aso4 2 at this ph region cornelis et al 2009 potysz et al 2016 the presence of iron hydroxide surfaces can also absorb substantial amounts of arsenate particularly at near neutral ph range antelo et al 2005 the presence of cationic species such as ca2 zn2 can also increase the as absorption capacity of ferrihydrite due to the change in the electrostatic forces at the solid solution interface antelo et al 2015 carabante et al 2012 the precipitation of zinc hydroxide carbonate at lowly alkaline ph range ph around 8 0 on iron ferrihydrite can also adsorb arsenic from the leachates carabante et al 2012 the similarity of the ph dependent leaching curves of as and fe and zn at ph above 10 0 also indicates the role of these two elements on the behaviour of as at alkaline ph however at ph above 11 0 formation of calcium arsenate can also play an important role on the mobility of as saikia et al 2006a the similarity of the shapes of the leaching curves of as and ca at ph above 12 5 and the stability of calcium arsenate at alkaline ph also indicates the role of ca on the mobility of as at high ph region the presence of considerable amounts of so4 2 in the slag and also in the leachate also indicate the possibilities of presence of competitive effect of sulfate with the oxyanions during their precipitations or sorption s on other mineral surfaces for example sulfate minerals such as pbso3 and pbso4 controlled the solubility of pb at acidic ph and therefore less pb will be available for the formation of pbaso4 table 5 the ph dependent leaching curves of se and mo are more or less similar and quite different from the as the leaching curves of se and mo reveal lower solubilities of these elements at low ph region on the other hand the leaching amount gradually increases with increasing ph particularly at ph above 8 wang et al 2007 also observed similar behaviour for se when coal fly ash was subjected to ph dependent leaching test such se leaching behaviour was related with the formation and behaviour of iron hydroxide surfaces the leaching behaviour of most of the cations and anions are strongly dependent on the solubility behaviour of fe and subsequent formation of surface active secondary iron minerals such as iron hydroxides nilsson et al 2016 adegoke et al 2013 at low ph i e acidic and near neutral conditions the surfaces of iron hydroxides are positively charged which can sorbed the negatively charged oxyanionic species due to attractive interactions cornwell et al 2004 such interactions play an important role on the mobilities of oxyanions on the other hand at higher ph the surfaces of iron hydroxides become negatively charged therefore sites available for sorption are decreased due to the repulsive interactions of oxyanions with the negatively charged iron surfaces however some amounts of oxyanions remains sorbed on the iron surfaces due to the neutralizations of some of the negative surface charges on iron surfaces by the cationic species such as ca2 mg2 zn2 and pb2 present in the leachate sorption desorption of oxyanions on the iron hydroxide surfaces is therefore a plausible mechanism for explaining the ph dependent leaching behaviours of se and mo from slag the minerals such as ca and ba selenite at low and high ph and powellite camoo4 are the some other mineral phases which may control the dissolution and precipitation behaviours of these elements too cornelis et al 2009 nishimura et al 2009 a comparison of leaching behaviour of se with the leaching behaviour of fe ca and ba it can be concluded that fe is the major element which controls the selenium mobility at acidic and alkaline ph region fig 6 it can also be concluded that the mobilities of ca2 and ba2 have also effect on the ph dependent leaching behaviour of selenium from the similarities of ph dependence leaching curves of ca and mo especially at ph 8 5 it can be concluded that the mobility of mo is probably controlled by powellite cornelis et al 2009 3 4 2 ph dependent leaching behaviours of cationic species the ph dependent leaching results of pb zn and cd are presented in fig 7 in the same fig the concentrations of some major elements present in the leachate are also presented the ph dependence leaching curves of pb and zn exhibit characteristics v shaped curves due to their amphoteric natures they also exhibit minimum solubility in the ph range of 8 0 9 5 partly due to the precipitation as hydroxides at extreme high and low ph regions ph 4 and 13 the dissolved amounts of metal species embedded in different minerals present in waste controls the equilibrium conditions an inspection of the ph dependent leaching curves of all three elements reveals that the dissolutions and precipitations are the major mechanism for their behaviours under varying ph conditions the similarities of ph dependent curve of pb with the ph dependent curves of fe and si at the ph 5 0 indicates that the dissolution of pb embedded in the various iron silicate minerals is the major mechanism for the mobility of pb at this ph zone anglesite pbso4 and pbso3 under acidic condition and laurionite pb oh cl under alkaline condition are the major solubility controlling phases of pb leaching from the fly ash generated in secondary pb smelting vitkova et al 2009 on the other hand for mswi apc residue pb2 co 3cl2 pbcloh and pb oh 2so4 are the solubility controlling phases at ph 4 6 6 12 and ph 12 respectively quina et al 2009 from the similarities of the ph dependent leaching curve of pb obtained in this study with the similar curves for pb leaching reported by quina et al 2009 and vitkova et al 2009 it can be concluded that the same types of mineral phases are the solubility controlling phases for pb leaching from slag in the ph range of 4 0 10 5 the weak correlations of the ph dependent leaching curve of pb with the curve of cl at the ph range of 2 5 5 5 and the curve of so4 2 at ph 12 0 also supports such conclusion the surface properties of iron hydroxide and calcium silicate hydrate can have profound effect on the mobility of pb especially at very high ph condition too a close inspection of the ph dependent leaching curves of pb with fe ca and si it can be inferred that the sorption desorption of pb on the iron hydroxide and calcium silicate hydrate partly controls the mobility of pb at ph above 10 5 the mobility of zn from various types of alkaline residues are mainly controlled by the solid mineral phases like znco3 and zno sio2 at ph 6 zn5 oh 8cl2 at ph 6 8 zno at ph 7 13 van der bruggen et al 1998 on the other hand van herck et al 2000 and quina et al 2009 observed zno sio2 znco3 and zn oh 2 as the solubility controlling phases for zn leaching from mswi fly yan et al 2008 observed znsio3 as the only precipitating species in the leachates of mswi fly ash at the ph range of 6 12 liu et al 2016 observed strong ph dependence on the zn sorption by ferrihydrite at ph 6 according to yan et al 2008 only dissolution precipitation mechanism without considering adsorption model is sufficient to explain the leaching behaviour of zn from mswi fly ash considering the similarities of the zn leaching curve obtained in this investigation with the results presented in van herck et al 2000 quina et al 2009 and yan et al 2008 papers it can be concluded that the zn leaching from slag in the ph range of 2 5 10 5 probably follows the dissolution precipitation mechanism involving species reported in these investigations the ph dependent leaching curve of zn is quite similar to the curves of fe si and ca at lower ph 5 5 also support that the dissolution of zn from the mineral phases is the major mechanism for zn behaviour at this region at the ph range of 5 5 10 5 zn is probably precipitated as znsio2 and zn oh 2 the similarities of the behaviour of zn with the behaviours of fe and ca at the ph range of 10 5 13 0 reveals that the surface properties of fe and ca containing minerals are more important than the dissolution precipitation mechanism for zn mobilization at this basic ph region however at ph 13 0 dissolution of zn minerals from the minerals containing zn si and fe is the major solubility controlling mechanism of zn from lead slag cd mobility at ph 9 0 is related with the cdcl2 and cdco3 van der bruggen et al 1998 yan et al 2008 on the other hand cdoh and cd oh 2 are the major phases at ph above 10 0 quina et al 2009 in several investigations cd4 oh 6so4 is considered as the major solubility controlling phases yan et al 2008 zhang et al 2008 similar types of mineral phases are probably responsible for cd mobility in slag especially at ph range of 4 10 however the similarities of ph dependent curves of cd with fe especially at ph above 10 indicate that the cd mobility of slag also dependent on the sorption desorption of cd compounds on iron hydroxide surfaces possibly surfaces of iron hydroxides adsorbed a part of cd at near neutral to alkaline ph dijkstra et al 2006 meima and comans 1998a b yan et al 2008 the ph dependent leaching curves of ni and cu along with fe are presented in fig 8 a comparison of the leaching curves of ni and cu with fe indicates that the mobilities of cu and ni are partly dependent on the ph dependent behaviour of fe according to zhang et al 2008 the sorption desorption of ni on iron hydroxide surfaces is the major solubility controlling mechanism of ni at the ph range of 6 0 9 0 while at ph 7 0 14 0 the ni mobility is controlled by ni oh 2 according to dijkstra et al 2006 2008 ni leaching from bottom ash at ph 10 0 14 0 is controlled by ni oh 2 at the ph range above 6 0 the sorption desorption of ni on the iron hydroxide surfaces partly controls the ni mobility in slag however formation of ni oh 2 is the major solubility controlling mechanism of ni at basic ph region similarly the dissolution precipitation is considered as the major solubility controlling mechanism of cu particularly at ph above 5 0 zhang et al 2008 eighmy et al 1995 dijkstra et al 2006 according to dijkstra et al 2006 at ph 8 0 surface complexation on aluminum hydroxide and iron hydroxide surface might be the major solubility controlling mechanism of cu at high ph probably formations of compounds such as cu oh 2 cu2co3 oh 2 are more important than the sorption desorption for explaining mobility of cu dijkstra et al 2008 from the comparison of cu and fe leaching behaviours as presented in fig 8 it can be concluded that fe compounds have little effect on the solubility of cu especially at ph below 13 0 thus the sorption desorption at low ph and formation of copper hydroxide compounds at high ph are the mechanisms which possibly control the ph dependent cu leaching from slag 3 4 3 ph dependent leaching behaviours of alkali metals chloride and sulfate fig 9 shows the ph dependent leaching behaviours of na k cl and so4 2 the dissolutions of these chemical species are also weakly dependent on the ph of the leachates thus some amounts of these species are occluded in the stable mineral phases which are solubilized at extreme acidic and basic conditions along with the embedding mineral phases however the ph effect is minimal at the at the ph range of 5 0 12 0 the curves reveal that the dissolution precipitation mechanism partly plays a rule for chloride especially at ph 5 0 and for sulfate in the ph range of 4 0 7 0 the striking similarities of the ph dependence leaching curves of na and k with the leaching curve of cl in the acidic to ph of about 12 7 indicates the existences of similar types of solubility controlling mechanisms for the ph dependence mobilizations of these elements however at higher ph chloride mobility is possibly controlled by the precipitations and dissolutions behaviours of some calcium based minerals such as fridel s salt ca2al oh 6cl 2h2o saikia et al 2006b 4 conclusions this study was undertaken to evaluate the toxicity behaviour of a lead smelting slag by evaluating the ph dependent leaching behaviours of some toxic metal and metalloid species the major conclusions of this investigation can be briefly summarized as a the concentrations of some of the toxic metal loid species in the leachates generated from slag are considerably higher than their specified limits for drinking water as well as the limit for inland surface disposal as effluents moreover the concentrations of pb and se in the leachate are higher than their specified limits prescribed for disposal of a waste as inert and non reactive hazardous waste in landfill about 0 745 meqv g acid is necessary to reach the ph 7 while for ph 5 this amount increased to 3 42 meqv g acid and for ph 4 the required amount is 37 3 meqv g the conductivity of leachate is very low at the ph range of 6 0 11 0 with a minimum at ph about 10 9 this ph range also corresponds to the minimum leaching region for almost all toxic elements except se and mo b the shapes of the ph dependent leaching curves reveal that the elements such as pb zn cu and cd present in slag are amphoteric in nature the ph dependent leaching behaviour of as can be related with the leaching behaviour of pb and to some extent with the behaviours of fe and zn the ph dependent leaching curves of se and mo are more or less similar to each other and quite different from as the dissolution of minerals especially ca fe and si containing minerals present in slag and consequent formations of secondary mineral phases at different ph regions are the major processes which control the ph dependent behaviour of various elements the leachings of sodium potassium and chloride from slag particularly in the ph range of 4 0 12 0 are ph independent and therefore their behaviours do not have effect on the mobilities of trace elements c finally it can be concluded that the disposal of pb smelter slag in open field without any treatment is a big threat to nearby area since high amounts of toxic metal and metalloid species especially se pb and zn are leached from slag at the ph range of 5 0 7 0 and very less amounts of acid is necessary to reach this ph range thus atmospheric carbonation followed by acidic rain can leached more than legal limits of these elements and severely pollute the surface as well as ground water similarly the use of slag as a raw material in cement based product development will also create environmental problems since large amounts of toxic elements will be liberated due to the additions of small amounts of alkaline solution into the slag moreover the methodologies applied in this investigation to analyze the ph dependence leaching results can be an effective approach for assessing the environmental impacts of similar types of other waste materials acknowledgement authors

12321,the influence of ph on the leaching behaviours of as cd cu mo ni pb se and zn from a lead smelter slag was assessed to understand the ground water pollution potential of slag and the toxicity in geo environmental conditions leaching of slag was investigated by using european en 12457 2 and pren 14429 leaching tests the results obtained from pren 14429 leaching test were used to determine the acid neutralization capacity anc of slag the ph dependent leaching results were further assessed by considering existing geo chemical modeling results of similar types of wastes results indicate that the concentrations of some toxic metal and metalloid species in the leachate are higher than their specified limits prescribed for safe landfill disposal as inert or non reactive hazardous solid waste as well as for safe disposal of effluent in inland surface water the anc values obtained for slag at ph values 7 5 and 4 are 0 75 meqv g 3 72 meqv g and 37 30 meqv g respectively the low anc values as well as the high concentrations of majority of the toxic elements in leachates especially at the ph range of 5 7 indicate hazardous nature of slag for disposal under open atmosphere the leaching behaviours of iron and calcium under varying ph conditions have profound effect on the ph dependent mobilities of most of the trace elements present in the slag the sodium potassium and chloride leaching from slag particularly in the ph range of 4 12 are ph independent and therefore do not have any effect on the mobilities of toxic elements graphical abstract fx1 keywords lead smelter slag heavy metals ph dependent leaching water pollution waste management 1 introduction various types of solid wastes are generated from municipalities and several industrial processes these wastes are categorized based on their properties such as material types hazard potentials or based on their origins e g organic inorganic considering hazard potentials these wastes can be classified into two types inert e g glass bottles excavated soil building and demolition waste and hazardous waste with high concentrations of heavy metals and toxic organic compounds such as nonferrous slags fly ash and apc residue generated in municipality solid waste incineration plants however regardless of the type hazard potential or origin the effective managements of solid wastes are important tasks for an environmentally sound society recycling as construction materials and land filling after detoxification are the major management options for these wastes mitchell et al 1992 chandler et al 1997 ferrous and non ferrous industries are among the most important producers of solid wastes such as metallurgical slag wastes from air pollution control technology applied in these industries and various sludges produced from blast furnaces the disposal of slag after treatment or use of slag as raw materials in road construction and as aggregates in concrete preparations is the major management options of these slags hughes and halliburton 1973 vegas et al 2008 penpolcharoen 2005 morrison et al 2003 atzeni et al 1996 saikia et al 2008 2012 despite the substantial amounts of slags are generated from non ferrous metal pb zn cu ni and cr processing industries very less numbers of studies are so far conducted to use nonferrous slags as raw materials in concrete production or in road construction on the other hand slags and other wastes generated from iron processing industries are widely used in cement and concrete productions the presence of elevated levels of toxic elements like as cd pb and se may be the major reason for not considering these slags as secondary materials in various infrastructure activities the pb and zn slags are produced during pyro metallurgical treatment of sulfide ores most of the pyro metallurgical wastes or metal smelter slags are dispersed in open environment or used in road constructions without any treatment barna et al 2004 jin et al 2014 the natural weathering of slag stored in slag heap can change the mineralogy of slag sobanska et al 2016 the release of toxic elements from slags upon contact with acidic rain water can pollute the soil as well as surface and ground water of nearby locality lewis 1992 sobanska et al 2000 reuter et al 2004 the greatest concentrations of contaminant metal and metalloid species generated from nonferrous metal smelters normally observe on the nearby soil surface of slag disposal sites ettler 2016 high concentrations of some toxic elements such as cd cu pb and zn in the ground water of nearby locality of slag disposal site due to the downward migrations of toxic metal and metalloid species from surface soil were also reported de andrade lima and bernardez 2013 ettler 2016 many studies indicated that the people leaving nearby locality of non ferrous slag dumping sites were affected by the toxic trace metals such as as cd cu pb zn de andrade lima and bernardez 2013 2017 carvalho et al 2003 ettler 2016 the leaching behaviours of majority of toxic elements are dependent on the various physico chemical properties of waste materials different types of leaching tests are normally performed to assess the toxicities of wastes in landfill or other disposal conditions leaching tests are also performed to assess the potential risks of a waste to human health and or ground water tiwari et al 2015 these include some regulatory tests to evaluate the materials for specific use or disposal scenarios all the leaching tests are classified into two classes batch or static and dynamic leaching tests in batch leaching test the size reduced waste is mixed with definite volume of leaching solutions and agitated the mixture for a short period of time typically for a few hours or for a day leaching test such as european en 12457 2 or din test en 12457 3 and american toxicity characteristic leaching procedure tclp test are the examples of regulatory batch leaching tests the results obtained from these types of tests are compared with specified listed values and therefore can be used to classify wastes according to classification types i e hazardous or inert the major objective of such regulatory specification is to prevent or reduce the negative impacts on the environment in particular on soil surface water groundwater and on human health from the landfilling of waste by introducing stringent technical requirements for waste and landfills in dynamic leaching test the leachate solution is renewed after a period and continued for long term tests such as european pren 14429 test and lysimeter or column tests are the examples of dynamic leaching tests in these tests the leaching solution is under continuous flux and therefore represents the field conditions one of the important factors influencing the releases of contaminants from waste materials during leaching evaluations is ph eighmy et al 1995 kosson et al 2002 krol and mizerna 2016 vitkova et al 2009 the solubility of a species from waste materials as well as the formations and precipitations of secondary minerals having contaminant species leached from wastes are normally ph dependent in other words the stability of a species in water or liquid medium can be directly related with the ph of aqueous medium and therefore the leaching behaviours of contaminant species from a waste is reflected by the ph dependence the ph dependence leaching behaviour of a waste thus provides information that can help to understand the fate and behaviour of a contaminant species in geo environmental conditions such results are often more useful than the results obtained from the analysis of total elemental composition or results obtained from simple batch leaching tests such as tclp test for assessing the environmental impacts as well as for determining the suitable management options of waste materials jarošíková et al 2017 the ph of leachates generated in leaching experiments is controlled by a number of factors e g dissolution of atmospheric co2 dissolution of minerals from wastes and secondary mineral formations to evaluate the ph effect on metal leaching a ph dependent static leaching test is commonly performed over a wide range of ph tiwari et al 2015 kosson et al 2002 this type of leaching test also provides information related to the potential buffering capacity of a waste material the test can also be used to evaluate the acid neutralization capacity of a waste cappuyns and swennen 2008 additional information can be obtained by combining the ph dependent leaching results and geochemical modeling and therefore such combination is a powerful tool to understand the solid phase speciations and reactivities of toxic metal or metalloid species in soils sediments and waste materials quina et al 2009 numerous studies have been done to understand the leaching behaviours of several types of waste materials using various types of leaching methodologies astrup et al 2006 cappuyns et al 2014 cornelis et al 2011 dijkstra et al 2006 2008 eighmy et al 1995 engstrom 2010 jarošíková et al 2017 potysz 2016 quina et al 2009 vitkova et al 2009 vitkova et al 2013 the leaching results so far obtained for various non ferrous slags indicate that the majority of the trace elements leached from slags occur at low or high ph regions and the concentrations at natural ph regions are normally low cappuyns et al 2014 cornelis et al 2011 jarošíková et al 2017 potysz 2016 yin et al 2016 factors such as minerals present in slag and atmospheric oxidative conditions during ph dependence leaching tests controls the leachings of various elements or chemical species from lead blast furnace slag and imperial smelting furnace slag cappuyns et al 2014 yin et al 2016 the geo chemical modeling of the results obtained from ph dependence leaching test coupled with the mineralogical compositions of wastes and their residues obtained after ph dependence leaching tests is a powerful tool for understanding the involved chemical processes during leaching schindler et al 2000 meima and comans 1998a hyks et al 2009 astrup et al 2006 dijkstra et al 2006 2008 quina et al 2009 cornelis et al 2011 cappuyns et al 2014 such information can be used for assessing environmental impact of waste materials as well quina et al 2009 potysz 2016 yin et al 2016 from the analysis of ph dependence leaching results of a mswi ash using geo chemical modeling software hyks et al 2009 classified elements as availability controlled solubility controlled and complexation sorption controlled quina et al 2009 used the available geo chemical modeling results of ph dependent leaching data of similar types of waste materials to explain the ph dependence leaching behaviour of mswi fly ash cornelis et al 2009 observed some striking similarities of some properties among the various types of wastes such as non ferrous slags mswi bottom ash and apc residues cornelis et al 2009 smelting of pb in a blast furnace located nearby area of antwerp belgium generates large amounts of slag the dumping of this slag in the vicinity of smelter site is an environmental threat due to presence of very high amounts of some metal and metalloid species the disposal or utilizations of lead slag in construction purposes are considered as the major sources of toxic elements such as as cu pb zn present in the soil as well as the surface and groundwater of nearby locality carvalho et al 2003 sobanska et al 2000 therefore a thorough environmental characterization procedure is necessary before considerations of pb slag for recycling or land filling purposes in our previous investigation a pb smelter slag was considered as a partial substitution of sand fraction in the preparation of cement mortar saikia et al 2008 2012 the slag met the required physical and mechanical properties for application as a partial substitution of sand fraction in cement mortar preparation however the leaching assessments of slag containing cement mortar samples by en12457 2 leaching test indicated that the concentrations of cu pb and zn in the leachate were higher than the specified limit for recycling as construction materials similarly substantial amounts of cu pb and zn were liberated when the slag containing cement mortars were subjected to nen 7345 leaching test saikia et al 2012 considering the toxicity of pb smelter slag as well as the importance of leaching tests in evaluating environmental impacts of wastes and other toxic materials on the soil surface water and groundwater in this investigation the leaching behaviours of a pb smelter slag was assessed using various standard leaching tests the toxicity of lead slag was first evaluated by using a regulatory european short term batch leaching test the ph dependent leaching curves of some toxic metal and metalloid species were eventually determined under anoxic condition by using a ph static test the interpretation of the ph dependent leaching results of toxic elements were done by using existing geo chemical modeling results reported for similar types of wastes it is envisaged that the leaching results presented in this work will be helpful for environmental impacts assessments and risk analyses of similar types of wastes too 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the metallurgical slag used in this investigation was a residue obtained from a lead blast furnace located in the nearby area of antwerp belgium after separation from the bullion the slag was cooled down and broken into finer particles the slag used in this study was a very hard and black coloured granular material having diameter in the range of 0 4 mm all the chemicals used in this investigation were ultrapure grade the ultrapure double distilled deionized milli q water with a very low conductance value was used during the investigation 2 2 characterization of slag 2 2 1 determination of chemical compositions of slag the sio2 so4 2 po4 3 and cl contents in the slag were determined by using standard gravimetric methods vogel 1961 the sulfates chlorides and phosphates were precipitated as baso4 agcl and mgnh4po4 6h2o respectively the total contents of other major and minor elements present in slag were determined by using an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrophotometer icp ms thermo elemental x series similar procedures as described in our previous communication were used to prepare samples saikia et al 2008 the liquid sample of the slag necessary for icp ms analyses was generated by acid digestion method using hno3 hclo4 and hf acids the concentrations obtained g l for most abundant species were converted into the weight percentages of the most abundant oxides for determining ph of slag a solid liquid mixture was prepared by shaking 3 g of powdered slag with 30 ml of water for 24 h using a magnetic stirrer the results presented in this work are the average values of three measurements 2 2 2 identification of minerals to identify the major crystalline components in the slag the x ray diffraction pattern of slag was recorded using a philips pw 1830 diffractometer equipped with a graphite monochromator and a gas proportional detector and using cu kα radiation minerals present in slag were identified using the diffract plus software employing the icdp pdf 2 database 2 3 leaching tests the leaching behaviour of slag was evaluated at 25 c by using european standard regulatory leaching test en 12457 2 saikia et al 2008 the en 12457 2 leaching test is a single step batch leaching test where water is used as a leaching solution the leaching is done at room temperature by using end over end agitation method with 24 h agitation time the liquid to solid ratio is maintained at 10 no clear definition is imposed on the particle size but the diameter of the particle must be less than 4 mm accordingly 15 g of powdered slag sample was mixed with 150 ml distilled deionized water in 250 ml plastic bottle the mixture was then agitated by using an electrical shaker for 24 h the pren 14429 leaching test was used to identify the leaching behaviour of slag under certain ph conditions the test consists of a set of parallel batch extractions of the sample at liquid to solid ratio of 10 ml g 1 in closed plastic containers in this investigation about 15 g samples were mixed with 150 ml aqueous solutions with increasing quantities of hno3 and naoh koh solutions in 250 ml plastic containers and agitated for 72 h using an electrical shaker the agitation was done in a thermostatic chamber to keep the shaking temperature at 20 c after completion of agitation i e leaching process the slag aqueous solution mixtures were separated into two portions a portion of the solution was used for determining the ph and conductivity and other portion was used for elemental analysis all the leaching experiments were done by using flat bottom horizontal shaker with 145 rpm shaking frequency for analyzing elemental concentrations about 100 ml of the leachate was filtered through a 0 45 m membrane filter and separated into two equal volume fractions a fraction was acidified with 1 ml of 65 hno3 acid to bring the ph 2 and kept to analyze the cations by icp ms the other fraction was directly used for analyzing the oxyanions of as mo sb se and v by icp ms and sulfate and chloride by ion chromatography all the samples were kept in a refrigerator until analyses 2 4 analysis of elemental compositions of digested slag solution and leachates 2 4 1 inductively coupled plasma mass spectrophotometric analysis the concentrations of cationic and other anionic species including silica were determined by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrophotometry icp ms for each elemental species the average of total six determinations was reported in this investigation moreover to obtain high quality data from the leaching test several precautionary measures were taken during whole experimental period in all the measurements done by icp ms analysis ultrapure multi elemental freshly prepared standard solutions with appropriate concentrations were used for calibrations and 115in was used as an internal standard adequate numbers of blank and standard solutions were used and calibration was occasionally done for getting high quality data the flushing of rinse blank solution and nebulization of samples were done prior to the analysis of sample until a steady state signal was achieved 2 4 2 ion chromatographic determinations of sulfate and chloride the concentrations of sulfate and chloride in the leachates were measured by a reagent free ion chromatography system with eluent regeneration rfic er model dionex ics 2000 the system can measure liquid samples containing very low amounts of anions e g 5 ppb bromate in drinking water less frequent eluent preparation reduces unintentional variations in the concentrations of anions and therefore increases the reliability and reproducibility during measurements during measurements adequate numbers of blank and standard solutions were used and calibration was occasionally done for getting high quality data for each anionic species the average of three determinations was reported 3 results and discussion 3 1 chemical and mineralogical properties the major and minor elements presents in slag are presented in table 1 the major oxides present in slag are the calcium oxide iron oxide and silica the combined content of these three oxides is about 90 of total oxides present in slag the slag also contains very high amounts of zno 5 01 and pbo 2 47 cuo 0 421 along with considerable amounts of as sb cr v and se the xrd pattern of slag is presented in fig 1 the minerals identified from the xrd patterns are presented in table 2 the detail discussion about the mineralogical composition of slag was already presented in another publication saikia et al 2008 slag contains calcium iron silicates kirschstenite and calcium zinc silicates hardystonite akermanite as the major minerals with substantial amounts of sphalerite zinc sulfide and wuestite feo the presence of considerable amounts of sulfide and wuestite in the slag indicates that the pb slag was formed under reducing condition erb satullo et al 2014 the xrd analysis detects several zn containing crystalline minerals in slag whereas no pb containing crystalline minerals are present in the xrd pattern although the concentrations of both metals in slag are quite high table 1 probably the amounts of pb based crystalline minerals present in slag are below the detection limit of xrd the same observation also indicates the difference in behaviour of these elements during formation of slag because of the similarities of size of fe2 and zn2 ionic radii of fe2 and zn2 are 0 76 and 0 74 å respectively zinc can substitute the divalent fe in several types of iron silicates ettler et al 2001 for the similar reason zn can substitute mg ionic radius 0 72 å in hardystonite ca2 mg zn si2o7 too thus because of the similarities in size most of the zn are mixed with the silicates and oxide melts and therefore incorporated into the crystalline minerals on the other hand because of the larger ionic size pb ionic radius 119 å is incompatible to the above types of silicates and oxide melts and therefore does not dissolve in melts during slag formation ettler et al 2001 zn may also be present as sulfides and possibly some amounts of zn also present as metallic inclusions or in pure metallic states ettler et al 2001 3 2 analysis using en 12457 2 leaching test the concentrations of some elements in the leachate obtained from slag powder after application of european standard en 12457 2 leaching test along with the limit values specified in various standards are presented in table 3 the results were already discussed in another communication considering the flemish nen 7343 leaching limit values for recycling as a granular construction material saikia et al 2008 therefore the comparisons of results with such standard will not be considered in this investigation however the pollution potential of slag is further assessed by comparing the leaching results with a national standard specification for drinking water standard for disposal of effluents of municipal solid wastes in inland surface water and the european standard specifications for landfill acceptance criteria it should be mentioned here that the tests such as lysimeter or column leaching tests are more appropriate for comparing leaching results with the drinking water standards than the results obtained from batch leaching tests such as en 12457 2 leaching test this is because of the fact that a fraction of trace elements present in leachates are normally absorbed by the mineral surfaces during transportation of leachates through the soil layers such processes can reduce the concentrations of trace elements in the leachates therefore the data obtained from batch leaching tests such as en 12457 2 leaching test may not be appropriate to assess the toxicity of waste leachate considering drinking water standards the en 12457 2 leaching test is normally performed to classify the waste according to european landfilled directive and to determine the reusability potential of a solid waste for construction purposes although there are some limitations leaching results obtained from batch leaching tests such as synthetic precipitation leaching procedure splp are occasionally compared with drinking water standards for assessing the trace element leaching potentials of waste materials legret et al 2005 townsend et al 2003 izquierdo et al 2005 obtained comparable leaching results for various trace elements when mswi bottom ash to be used as an unbound granular material for road pavements was subjected to en 12457 2 leaching test and a column type field leaching test table 3 indicates that the concentrations of al as mo ni se and pb in the leachate generated from slag cross the standard specified limits prescribed for drinking water similarly se and pb concentrations in the leachate along with the ph of leachates do not meet the specified limits set for the respective elements for safe disposal of waste effluents in inland surface water the concentrations of se and pb in the leachates do not meet the european landfilled criteria for disposal as inert as well as non reactive hazardous wastes too thus the disposal of investigated slag in open field will severely pollute the nearby ground as well as surface water and therefore some precautions will be necessary during handling and disposal of the pb slag if we consider the total concentration it can be inferred that the concentrations of majority of the toxic elements in the leachates are quite low although their concentrations in slag are very high this indicates that the mineralogical composition influences the leaching of elements from the slag for example the concentration of pb in the leachate is quite high in comparison to the zn concentration although the zn content in the slag is almost twice the amount of pb present in slag the leaching of low amounts of zn despite the high zn content in slag can be related with the stability of zn containing minerals in slag zn is present in some crystalline silicate minerals hardystonite kirchstenite and sulfide mineral sphalerite which are quite stable in applied leaching conditions cappuyns 2014 on the other hand in slag pb is possibly present as easily leachable metallic or intermetallic state and therefore substantial amounts of pb are leached from the slag during leaching barna et al 2004 therefore from the xrd study as well as the leaching behaviour it can be concluded that pb in slag is primarily present as a metallic inclusion trapped in the amorphous glass or in crystalline forms as a pure metal or in intermetallic state or as sulfide compounds ettler et al 2001 3 3 acid neutralization capacity anc the change in ph due to the additions of different volumes of acids and bases into the slag during leaching experiments are presented in fig 2 the figure indicates initial slow increase in ph from 2 5 to 4 5 with large amounts of basicity consumptions followed by a rapid change in ph 4 5 11 8 within a very small range of acid or base consumption zone the changes in ph again slowdowns in the ph range of 11 8 13 2 with increasing base additions the slow change in ph indicates the existence of a buffering zone at high ph region considering the presence of considerable amounts of ca and si in the slag and in the leachates the carbonation and associated interaction of co2 with mineral phases like portlandite as well as the formations of calcium silicate hydrates may be the major reason for such behaviour garrabrants et al 2004 the dissolution of acidic sulfide minerals present in slag due to the addition of base can also increase the h ion concentrations and therefore decrease the ph of leachates by introducing strong acidic environment cappuyns 2014 on the other hand at low ph alkali and alkaline earth metals are liberated due to the dissolution of silicate minerals present in slag the emitted alkali and alkaline earth metals neutralize the added amounts of acids and therefore a weak buffering zone is appeared the acid neutralization capacity anc of a waste i e capacity of waste to neutralize acids is a key property to understand the long term waste behaviour in environment as the dissolutions followed by precipitations of metals are directly related with anc values the results obtained from pren 14429 leaching test can also be used to assess the acid neutralization capacity of a waste material too for this purpose the amount of acid added in ml was converted into the equivalent of acids per gram of dry waste and presented in fig 3 about 0 75 meqv g acid is necessary to reach the ph 7 while for reaching ph 5 this amount increases to 3 92 meqv g acid and for ph 4 the necessary amount of acid is 37 25 meqv g this indicates the existence of a strong buffering zone between ph 5 and 4 moreover in comparison to other waste materials such as municipal incineration ash investigated slag has very low ancph7 which is in accordance with the values reported for other non ferrous slags cornelis et al 2011 table 4 shows the anc values of slag and concentrations of a few toxic elements in leachates obtained in the ph range of 4 0 10 7 in the same table the acceptable limit values for these elements according to european directive for classifying a waste for landfilling purposes are also presented from the results it can be concluded that the addition of small amounts of acid can leached substantial amounts of toxic elements most of which are quite higher than the standard specifications for example when leaching was done by using distilled water as a leaching solution the concentrations of pb and zn in the leachate were 49 1 and 0 9 mg kg respectively and the ph of the leachate was 10 7 the leaching of slag by using 0 745 meqv g acid containing water generated a leachates having ph 7 04 the concentrations of pb and zn in the leachates were 8 4 and 194 mg kg respectively and well above the standard specified limits for disposal as inert waste in landfill the pb and zn concentrations in the leachate further increased to 3909 5 mg kg and 1451 mg kg respectively when leaching was done by using 3 72 meqv g acid containing water the ph of the leachate was also decreased to 5 07 the same behaviours can be observed for the majority of other trace elements the variation of conductivity of leachate generated from slag against the variation of ph values is presented in fig 4 the conductivities of leachates generally low in the ph range of 6 12 with a minimum at ph about 10 9 this range also corresponds to the minimum leaching region for most of the major and minor elements fig 4 also shows strong relationship between the ph dependent conductivity values of leachates with the concentrations of some major and trace elements present in the leachates the dependence of conductivity curve on the concentrations of ca fe si pb and zn also indicates that the ph dependence leaching behaviours of most of the trace elements are probably dependent on the behaviours of these elements 3 4 ph dependent leaching behaviour in order to understand the effect of ph on the leaching behaviour of toxic metal and metalloid species the experimental results of these toxic species obtained from pren 14429 leaching test were analyzed and compared with the leaching behaviour of some major elements present in the slag considering the similarities of leaching properties of alkaline wastes such as mswi bottom ash and apc residue ffc fly ash with metallurgical slags in this investigation therefore an attempt has been made to explain the leaching behaviours of toxic elements of slag by using the existing geo chemical modeling information along with the surface chemistry results for related wastes cornelis et al 2011 quina et al 2009 table 5 shows the solubility controlling mineral phases and physical processes those reported for various types of alkaline wastes the higher leachabilities of elements with increasing acidity and basicity of the leachates from neutral ph as observed from the ph dependent leaching curves indicate that most of the elements are associated with the relatively stable silicates and oxide minerals of slag cappuyns 2014 the ph dependent leaching of most of the major as well as minor metal or metalloid species exhibits a u or v shaped curves characteristics for amphoteric nature vitkova et al 2009 nilsson et al 2016 the leaching amount of each element at extreme acidic condition is more than that observed in extreme basic condition the dissolution of minerals present in slag and consequent formations of secondary mineral phases at different ph conditions are the major processes which control the ph dependent behaviour of various elements in the leachates thus at extreme high and low ph regions ph 4 and ph 13 the equilibrium concentrations of almost all investigated elements are controlled by the solubilization of elements from the slag considering the behaviours of various elements in the ph dependence leaching curves it can be concluded that the upward trend of their concentrations observed in the leaching curve indicates the dissolution of a species from minerals during leaching process on the other hand a downward trend after an upward trend indicates the precipitation of the species due to various physico chemical phenomena ettringite a hydrated calcium aluminosulfate and calcium silicate hydrate are the cement based minerals those can accommodate cations and oxyanions of as mo and se in its structure by various physico chemical processes gougar et al 1996 saikia et al 2006a these minerals are normally precipitated as secondary minerals during leaching of high calcium and silica containing wastes such as coal fly ash and control the mobilities of different toxic elements at various environmental conditions saikia et al 2006a chemical analysis indicates the presence of high amounts of cao sio2 along with the considerable amounts of al2o3 and so4 2 in the slag therefore like some other wastes these species may come into the solution due to the interaction of slag with high alkaline leaching solution and at appropriate chemical environment they can form ettringite and calcium silicate hydrate type minerals dermatas and meng 2003 the concentrations of al ca si and sulfate in the leachate at various ph are presented in fig 5 the more or less similar leaching curves of calcium and silica particularly at high ph region indicate some correlation between these two species therefore at high ph there is a strong possibility of the formation of calcium silicate hydrate type minerals due to the reaction of calcium and silica the formation of such secondary mineral surfaces also controls the leaching behaviour of several minor elements particularly at high ph region engstrom 2010 also observed the formation of calcium silicate hydrate during leaching of eaf slag having similar type of mineral composition in comparison to the behaviours of other three species presented in fig 5 sulfate concentrations in the leachate are relatively constant in the near neutral to alkaline ph zones possibly sulfate does not have any active role on the mobility of minor elements especially at high ph region and therefore the role of ettringite on the mobility of trace elements can be ruled out 3 4 1 ph dependent leaching behaviour of oxyanions fig 6 shows the ph dependent leaching behaviours of as mo and se for comparison purpose the ph dependent leaching curves of some major metal species are also included in the figure the shapes of ph dependent leaching curve of as generates a u or v shaped curve which is characteristic of an amphoteric element and in accordance with the leaching curves of pb and fe the similarities of the behaviour of pb with aso4 2 in the ph range of acidic to ph 10 8 suggest that the formation of pbaso4 and pb3 aso4 2 may be the major solubility controlling minerals for aso4 2 at this ph region cornelis et al 2009 potysz et al 2016 the presence of iron hydroxide surfaces can also absorb substantial amounts of arsenate particularly at near neutral ph range antelo et al 2005 the presence of cationic species such as ca2 zn2 can also increase the as absorption capacity of ferrihydrite due to the change in the electrostatic forces at the solid solution interface antelo et al 2015 carabante et al 2012 the precipitation of zinc hydroxide carbonate at lowly alkaline ph range ph around 8 0 on iron ferrihydrite can also adsorb arsenic from the leachates carabante et al 2012 the similarity of the ph dependent leaching curves of as and fe and zn at ph above 10 0 also indicates the role of these two elements on the behaviour of as at alkaline ph however at ph above 11 0 formation of calcium arsenate can also play an important role on the mobility of as saikia et al 2006a the similarity of the shapes of the leaching curves of as and ca at ph above 12 5 and the stability of calcium arsenate at alkaline ph also indicates the role of ca on the mobility of as at high ph region the presence of considerable amounts of so4 2 in the slag and also in the leachate also indicate the possibilities of presence of competitive effect of sulfate with the oxyanions during their precipitations or sorption s on other mineral surfaces for example sulfate minerals such as pbso3 and pbso4 controlled the solubility of pb at acidic ph and therefore less pb will be available for the formation of pbaso4 table 5 the ph dependent leaching curves of se and mo are more or less similar and quite different from the as the leaching curves of se and mo reveal lower solubilities of these elements at low ph region on the other hand the leaching amount gradually increases with increasing ph particularly at ph above 8 wang et al 2007 also observed similar behaviour for se when coal fly ash was subjected to ph dependent leaching test such se leaching behaviour was related with the formation and behaviour of iron hydroxide surfaces the leaching behaviour of most of the cations and anions are strongly dependent on the solubility behaviour of fe and subsequent formation of surface active secondary iron minerals such as iron hydroxides nilsson et al 2016 adegoke et al 2013 at low ph i e acidic and near neutral conditions the surfaces of iron hydroxides are positively charged which can sorbed the negatively charged oxyanionic species due to attractive interactions cornwell et al 2004 such interactions play an important role on the mobilities of oxyanions on the other hand at higher ph the surfaces of iron hydroxides become negatively charged therefore sites available for sorption are decreased due to the repulsive interactions of oxyanions with the negatively charged iron surfaces however some amounts of oxyanions remains sorbed on the iron surfaces due to the neutralizations of some of the negative surface charges on iron surfaces by the cationic species such as ca2 mg2 zn2 and pb2 present in the leachate sorption desorption of oxyanions on the iron hydroxide surfaces is therefore a plausible mechanism for explaining the ph dependent leaching behaviours of se and mo from slag the minerals such as ca and ba selenite at low and high ph and powellite camoo4 are the some other mineral phases which may control the dissolution and precipitation behaviours of these elements too cornelis et al 2009 nishimura et al 2009 a comparison of leaching behaviour of se with the leaching behaviour of fe ca and ba it can be concluded that fe is the major element which controls the selenium mobility at acidic and alkaline ph region fig 6 it can also be concluded that the mobilities of ca2 and ba2 have also effect on the ph dependent leaching behaviour of selenium from the similarities of ph dependence leaching curves of ca and mo especially at ph 8 5 it can be concluded that the mobility of mo is probably controlled by powellite cornelis et al 2009 3 4 2 ph dependent leaching behaviours of cationic species the ph dependent leaching results of pb zn and cd are presented in fig 7 in the same fig the concentrations of some major elements present in the leachate are also presented the ph dependence leaching curves of pb and zn exhibit characteristics v shaped curves due to their amphoteric natures they also exhibit minimum solubility in the ph range of 8 0 9 5 partly due to the precipitation as hydroxides at extreme high and low ph regions ph 4 and 13 the dissolved amounts of metal species embedded in different minerals present in waste controls the equilibrium conditions an inspection of the ph dependent leaching curves of all three elements reveals that the dissolutions and precipitations are the major mechanism for their behaviours under varying ph conditions the similarities of ph dependent curve of pb with the ph dependent curves of fe and si at the ph 5 0 indicates that the dissolution of pb embedded in the various iron silicate minerals is the major mechanism for the mobility of pb at this ph zone anglesite pbso4 and pbso3 under acidic condition and laurionite pb oh cl under alkaline condition are the major solubility controlling phases of pb leaching from the fly ash generated in secondary pb smelting vitkova et al 2009 on the other hand for mswi apc residue pb2 co 3cl2 pbcloh and pb oh 2so4 are the solubility controlling phases at ph 4 6 6 12 and ph 12 respectively quina et al 2009 from the similarities of the ph dependent leaching curve of pb obtained in this study with the similar curves for pb leaching reported by quina et al 2009 and vitkova et al 2009 it can be concluded that the same types of mineral phases are the solubility controlling phases for pb leaching from slag in the ph range of 4 0 10 5 the weak correlations of the ph dependent leaching curve of pb with the curve of cl at the ph range of 2 5 5 5 and the curve of so4 2 at ph 12 0 also supports such conclusion the surface properties of iron hydroxide and calcium silicate hydrate can have profound effect on the mobility of pb especially at very high ph condition too a close inspection of the ph dependent leaching curves of pb with fe ca and si it can be inferred that the sorption desorption of pb on the iron hydroxide and calcium silicate hydrate partly controls the mobility of pb at ph above 10 5 the mobility of zn from various types of alkaline residues are mainly controlled by the solid mineral phases like znco3 and zno sio2 at ph 6 zn5 oh 8cl2 at ph 6 8 zno at ph 7 13 van der bruggen et al 1998 on the other hand van herck et al 2000 and quina et al 2009 observed zno sio2 znco3 and zn oh 2 as the solubility controlling phases for zn leaching from mswi fly yan et al 2008 observed znsio3 as the only precipitating species in the leachates of mswi fly ash at the ph range of 6 12 liu et al 2016 observed strong ph dependence on the zn sorption by ferrihydrite at ph 6 according to yan et al 2008 only dissolution precipitation mechanism without considering adsorption model is sufficient to explain the leaching behaviour of zn from mswi fly ash considering the similarities of the zn leaching curve obtained in this investigation with the results presented in van herck et al 2000 quina et al 2009 and yan et al 2008 papers it can be concluded that the zn leaching from slag in the ph range of 2 5 10 5 probably follows the dissolution precipitation mechanism involving species reported in these investigations the ph dependent leaching curve of zn is quite similar to the curves of fe si and ca at lower ph 5 5 also support that the dissolution of zn from the mineral phases is the major mechanism for zn behaviour at this region at the ph range of 5 5 10 5 zn is probably precipitated as znsio2 and zn oh 2 the similarities of the behaviour of zn with the behaviours of fe and ca at the ph range of 10 5 13 0 reveals that the surface properties of fe and ca containing minerals are more important than the dissolution precipitation mechanism for zn mobilization at this basic ph region however at ph 13 0 dissolution of zn minerals from the minerals containing zn si and fe is the major solubility controlling mechanism of zn from lead slag cd mobility at ph 9 0 is related with the cdcl2 and cdco3 van der bruggen et al 1998 yan et al 2008 on the other hand cdoh and cd oh 2 are the major phases at ph above 10 0 quina et al 2009 in several investigations cd4 oh 6so4 is considered as the major solubility controlling phases yan et al 2008 zhang et al 2008 similar types of mineral phases are probably responsible for cd mobility in slag especially at ph range of 4 10 however the similarities of ph dependent curves of cd with fe especially at ph above 10 indicate that the cd mobility of slag also dependent on the sorption desorption of cd compounds on iron hydroxide surfaces possibly surfaces of iron hydroxides adsorbed a part of cd at near neutral to alkaline ph dijkstra et al 2006 meima and comans 1998a b yan et al 2008 the ph dependent leaching curves of ni and cu along with fe are presented in fig 8 a comparison of the leaching curves of ni and cu with fe indicates that the mobilities of cu and ni are partly dependent on the ph dependent behaviour of fe according to zhang et al 2008 the sorption desorption of ni on iron hydroxide surfaces is the major solubility controlling mechanism of ni at the ph range of 6 0 9 0 while at ph 7 0 14 0 the ni mobility is controlled by ni oh 2 according to dijkstra et al 2006 2008 ni leaching from bottom ash at ph 10 0 14 0 is controlled by ni oh 2 at the ph range above 6 0 the sorption desorption of ni on the iron hydroxide surfaces partly controls the ni mobility in slag however formation of ni oh 2 is the major solubility controlling mechanism of ni at basic ph region similarly the dissolution precipitation is considered as the major solubility controlling mechanism of cu particularly at ph above 5 0 zhang et al 2008 eighmy et al 1995 dijkstra et al 2006 according to dijkstra et al 2006 at ph 8 0 surface complexation on aluminum hydroxide and iron hydroxide surface might be the major solubility controlling mechanism of cu at high ph probably formations of compounds such as cu oh 2 cu2co3 oh 2 are more important than the sorption desorption for explaining mobility of cu dijkstra et al 2008 from the comparison of cu and fe leaching behaviours as presented in fig 8 it can be concluded that fe compounds have little effect on the solubility of cu especially at ph below 13 0 thus the sorption desorption at low ph and formation of copper hydroxide compounds at high ph are the mechanisms which possibly control the ph dependent cu leaching from slag 3 4 3 ph dependent leaching behaviours of alkali metals chloride and sulfate fig 9 shows the ph dependent leaching behaviours of na k cl and so4 2 the dissolutions of these chemical species are also weakly dependent on the ph of the leachates thus some amounts of these species are occluded in the stable mineral phases which are solubilized at extreme acidic and basic conditions along with the embedding mineral phases however the ph effect is minimal at the at the ph range of 5 0 12 0 the curves reveal that the dissolution precipitation mechanism partly plays a rule for chloride especially at ph 5 0 and for sulfate in the ph range of 4 0 7 0 the striking similarities of the ph dependence leaching curves of na and k with the leaching curve of cl in the acidic to ph of about 12 7 indicates the existences of similar types of solubility controlling mechanisms for the ph dependence mobilizations of these elements however at higher ph chloride mobility is possibly controlled by the precipitations and dissolutions behaviours of some calcium based minerals such as fridel s salt ca2al oh 6cl 2h2o saikia et al 2006b 4 conclusions this study was undertaken to evaluate the toxicity behaviour of a lead smelting slag by evaluating the ph dependent leaching behaviours of some toxic metal and metalloid species the major conclusions of this investigation can be briefly summarized as a the concentrations of some of the toxic metal loid species in the leachates generated from slag are considerably higher than their specified limits for drinking water as well as the limit for inland surface disposal as effluents moreover the concentrations of pb and se in the leachate are higher than their specified limits prescribed for disposal of a waste as inert and non reactive hazardous waste in landfill about 0 745 meqv g acid is necessary to reach the ph 7 while for ph 5 this amount increased to 3 42 meqv g acid and for ph 4 the required amount is 37 3 meqv g the conductivity of leachate is very low at the ph range of 6 0 11 0 with a minimum at ph about 10 9 this ph range also corresponds to the minimum leaching region for almost all toxic elements except se and mo b the shapes of the ph dependent leaching curves reveal that the elements such as pb zn cu and cd present in slag are amphoteric in nature the ph dependent leaching behaviour of as can be related with the leaching behaviour of pb and to some extent with the behaviours of fe and zn the ph dependent leaching curves of se and mo are more or less similar to each other and quite different from as the dissolution of minerals especially ca fe and si containing minerals present in slag and consequent formations of secondary mineral phases at different ph regions are the major processes which control the ph dependent behaviour of various elements the leachings of sodium potassium and chloride from slag particularly in the ph range of 4 0 12 0 are ph independent and therefore their behaviours do not have effect on the mobilities of trace elements c finally it can be concluded that the disposal of pb smelter slag in open field without any treatment is a big threat to nearby area since high amounts of toxic metal and metalloid species especially se pb and zn are leached from slag at the ph range of 5 0 7 0 and very less amounts of acid is necessary to reach this ph range thus atmospheric carbonation followed by acidic rain can leached more than legal limits of these elements and severely pollute the surface as well as ground water similarly the use of slag as a raw material in cement based product development will also create environmental problems since large amounts of toxic elements will be liberated due to the additions of small amounts of alkaline solution into the slag moreover the methodologies applied in this investigation to analyze the ph dependence leaching results can be an effective approach for assessing the environmental impacts of similar types of other waste materials acknowledgement authors

12322,a comprehensive hydrochemical study has been carried out to evaluate the impact of anthropogenic activities like industrial effluents open defecation and untreated sewerage disposal on groundwater and surface water in chincholi industrial area the study area comprises of 3 sites viz kondi pakni and chincholi with approximate 7000 population and out of that 81 defecates openly many industries release effluent in simple pits and surface water tanks without any prior treatment and people harness water from contaminated aquifers a total 55 water samples have been collected during pre and post monsoon seasons of 2015 according to the bis at many sample locations the contents of th ca na cl no3 and tds exceeded the desirable limit the piper plot suggests that alkaline earth exceeds the alkalis and strong acid dominate over weak acid in pre and post monsoon however elevated contents of nitrate and chloride in post monsoon season are owed to increased percolation of effluent and agricultural waste along with the recharging water the strong positive correlation between cl no3 and tds represents the contamination is of anthropogenic origin supported by the cluster analysis by forming three different clusters all the parameters exceed the safe limits of the bis in surface water samples from industrial area due to the mixing of untreated effluents while the samples from non industrial area remain unpolluted the study concludes that the anthropogenic activities like sewerage disposal open defecation and discharged effluent disposal threatening the groundwater and surface water quality few aquifers from chincholi and pakni site are affected most due to industrial effluent and agricultural waste while few samples from kondi site are polluted due to unlined drainage to overcome the problem discharged waste water should be treated and enhancement of sanitation systems along with best management practices in agriculture is essential graphical abstract fx1 keywords groundwater surface water sewage effluent discharge bis chincholi industrial area 1 introduction water is a key component for the sustainable development of the society the arid and semiarid regions around the world are facing great challenge of satisfying demands of the water for drinking industrial and agriculture zhang 2014 the groundwater is considered to be safe source for drinking due to its natural quality consistent temperature and less susceptibility as compared with other fresh water resources therefore many people depends on groundwater sources such as dug well bore well hand pumps etc for drinking and domestic purpose recently it is evident that groundwater quality and quantity are posing significant threats due to over extraction and anthropogenic inputs generally groundwater quality is influenced by geogenic factors like composition of host rock rock and water interaction residence time climate etc and hydrogeological factors such as water table depth soil matrix and anthropogenic activities includes domestic agricultural and industrial wastes todd and mays 2005 lawrence et al 2001 kumar et al 2009 sorensen et al 2016 keesari et al 2016

defection around the world includes over 600 million in india sorensen et al 2016 who unicef 2014 who 2012 in low income communities installation of sewerage system is unfeasible as it requires significant capital investment and a piped water supply therefore pit latrines and pour flush toilets usually adopted paterson et al 2007 as concern with the population pressure in india it is rather difficult to install centralized water supply and waste water treatment system which requires large capital investment national environmental and engineering research institute india neeri conducted study of ten cities in the country concludes that groundwater pollution occur due to on site sanitation system relates to unconfined and to a lesser degree to semi confined aquifers while deep and confined aquifers remains unaffected the fractured rock aquifers are more susceptible to pollution as compared with alluvium aquifers also confirms that the hydrogeological setup of the area plays a crucial role in the pollution dispersion from on site sanitation neeri 2005 sorensen et al 2016 corroborated that in bihar state of india the groundwater is polluted from fecal coliforms due to the lack of sanitary seals headworks and subsurface installation shivendra and ramaraju 2015 investigated that on site sanitation system in peri urban areas of bangalore city are increasing the concentration of chloride nitrate and total dissolved solids is owed to the disposal of septic tank effluents along with sullage water in open drains similar investigation was reported by templeton et al 2015 in peri urban area of african cities found that the nitrate content is elevated beyond the who permissible limit within short period to a considerable depth of aquifer 50m due to the pit latrines back et al 2018 reported enrichment of nitrate content and microbiological contamination in developing country due to improper sanitation systems while high albeit low concentration nitrate correlated with some radial metrics confirms the mixing of latrine effluents the industrial effluents need treatment and purification setup however to avoid such capital costs many industries discharge their effluents into simple pits open space water body etc such effluent is drained by rain water over longer distance which increases lateral and vertical spread of contaminates in aquifer which raise serious environmental threats kumar and shah 2006 ramaraju 2009 chintalapudi et al 2017 minhas et al 2004 stated that in india only 24 of wastewater treated with primary treatment before its disposal into river water or use for agriculture including metro cities such partially treated wastewater causes environmental implications as surface water and groundwater contamination soil degradation and contamination of crops grown on polluted water mccornick et al 2004 scott et al 2004 the water resources are vulnerable to nitrate and chloride contamination due to continuous loading of nitrate from agricultural domestic industrial waste etc naik et al 2008 investigated the impact of urbanization on groundwater quality is deteriorated due to the seepages of unlined sewage lines domestic drains and leachate from waste dumps in solapur city however dug wells are more susceptible to nitrate pollution as compared with bore wells the several studies throughout india confirmed the infiltration of industrial effluents is a serious cause of aquifer contamination rao et al 2001 sobha and anish 2003 pujari and deshpande 2005 singh et al 2006 naik et al 2007 pujari et al 2007 pius

prepare a baseline data for futuristic comparative assessment and monitoring of water resources from chincholi industrial area the need of hydro geochemical aspects in relation to industrial and sanitation aspects was not recognized manifestly in the study area however few studies carried out by nodal agencies like groundwater survey and development agency gsda and central ground water board

at three different sites i e kondi pakni and chincholi to find out the lateral and vertical spread of pollution and its sources the objectives of the present study are i to recognize the impacts of anthropogenic inputs and assess the seasonal variations in shallow and deep aquifer and surface water quality ii to assess the concentration of critical parameters like nitrate chloride and total dissolved solids iii to identify the lateral and vertical spread of pollution and possible sources of contaminants increasing the risk of human health and environmental resource degradation 2 study

aquifers bore well hand pumps which are used for domestic and agricultural purpose the samples were collected in pre washed one liter polyethylene narrow mouth cans after pumping the wells for 5 10min prior to sampling the cans were pretreated with acid and rinsed with water for 2 3 times to avoid any contamination afterwards these cans were sealed labeled and brought to laboratory for analysis the ph and ec values were recorded in field itself by using portable digital meter multi parameter pcs tester 35 the rest of physicochemical parameters such as ca mg co3 hco3 and cl were analyzed in the laboratory by gravimetric analysis following the standard methods of american public health association apha 2005 the sodium na and potassium k ions were determined by using flame photometer elico cl

ion data was calculated by using charge balance error cbe equation eq 1 and values found 10 hounslow 1995 the arc gis 9 3 software was used to know the spatial extent of ions the multivariate statistical analysis is performed through statistical package for social sciences spss 22 0 software 1 c b e c a t i o n s a n i o n s c a t i o n s a n i o n s 100 4 result and discussion the descriptive statistics of analytical results of groundwater and surface water samples are summarized in tables 1 and 2 4 1 kondi site the kondi site is characterized as barren land with diminutive anthropogenic activities due to the limited water availability this site has minuscule industrial and agricultural activities and groundwater is the only source to meet the demand of industrial agriculture and domestic activities analytical results inferred that ph value varied from 8 0 to 8 7 in pre monsoon and 8 0 8 5 in post monsoon season which indicates feebly alkaline nature three samples sample numbers 6 7 and 13 found beyond the bis limits in pre monsoon season owed to loss of co2 and precipitation of mineral salts pawar and kale 2006 the ph value of natural groundwater ranges from 6 0 to 9 0 mainly influenced by carbon dioxide microbial activity and plant photosynthesis brian et al 1999 horne and goldman 1994 the ec value denotes the amount of dissolved salts due to leaching of aquifer media or mixing of other sources such as sea water intrusion or waste water seeping the groundwater samples have ec in the range of 1056 0 3762 0µs cm avg 1847 µs cm in pre monsoon and 966 0 3320 0µs cm avg 1825 00µs cm in post monsoon season represents the moderate mineralization of aquifers the average concentration of tds is 642 78mg l in pre monsoon and 681 58mg l in post monsoon season which is beyond the desirable limit but below the permissible limit of the bis bis 10500 2012 the high tds value limits the potability of water and may cause the gastro intestinal irritation in human the chloride is one of the major anion mainly contributed by geogenic weathering of sodalite apatite micas and hornblende minerals and anthropogenic sewage seawater and saline residues in soil sources hem 1991 the chloride content in groundwater samples is far below the permissible limits of the bis swerves from 39 76 to 187 44mg l in pre monsoon and 48 6 190 46mg l in post monsoon seasons the low chloride content signifies that study area is devoid of geogenic sources and not affected from anthropogenic activities the nitrate content in groundwater deflects from 18 3 to 51 24mg l with an average 30 57mg l in pre monsoon and 21 29 61 46mg l with an average value 35 32mg l in post monsoon season the average content of nitrate is increased in post monsoon despite the dissolution from recharge water similar findings have been reported by neeri report 2005 pujari et al 2007 2012 the concentration of nitrate decreases with lowering water table wherein anaerobic conditions are prevailed where nitrate is partially converted to nitrogen lawrence et al 2001 the quality of groundwater in deccan volcanic province dvp is dominated by ca mg hco3 but during monsoon the groundwater is recharged with chloride sulfate nitrate sodium calcium magnesium and negligible amounts of bicarbonates das et al 2004 the increased concentration of chloride and nitrate in post monsoon season is owed to the runoff from domestic and agricultural fields the sample numbers 7 17 and 18 have high nitrate concentration 45mg l which is due to the nonexistence of concrete sewerage line poor sanitary seals and incompetent casing as compared with the bis standards all the parameters are within permissible limit except nitrate content suggests the drinking feasibility fig 2a c the overall results pinpointing that the aquifers of this site are well maintained in their natural state while few have diminutive impact of anthropogenic inputs 4 2 pakni site the pakni site is under extensive agriculture and irrigated through seena river water ujani canal water and groundwater situated to the sw of chincholi industrial area the ph value varied from 7 9 to 8 5 and 7 88 to 8 4 in pre and post monsoon season which suggests slight alkaline nature the majority of the samples fall within the bis limit and natural ph range of groundwater the ec values of the groundwater samples range from 2136 0 to 5347 0µs cm with an average 3495 73µs cm in pre monsoon whereas 2016 0 5600 0µs cm with an average 3620 80µs cm in post monsoon season the high average concentration represents the increased mineralization which elevates the salinity of groundwater the average concentration of total dissolved solids tds is high in pre monsoon 1126 39mg l than post monsoon season 1095 28mg l due to the dissolution of salts and evaporation of water all the groundwater samples are above the desirable level and below the permissible limit of the bis fig 2a c it is illustrated that the concentration of tds is increased as compared with kondi site can be attributed to salts leached from agricultural fields the chloride concentration varies from 117 86 to 539 6mg l and 139 16 546 7mg l with average value of 278 86 in pre monsoon and 268 73mg l in post monsoon season the graphical representation depicts that the pakni site shows elevated concentration may be due to the infiltration of salts along with recharging water is especially anthropogenic however 46 66 samples from pakni site are above the desirable limit of chloride are augmentation of domestic agricultural waste the sample number 20 21 and 22 are may be affected due to percolation of contaminants from surface water sampling site s3 and 25 26 and 27 due to inputs from the domestic drainage agricultural waste and open defecation high chloride content in groundwater may result from natural and anthropogenic sources viz weathering of halite mineral domestic effluent fertilizers septic tanks and leachate from landfills sites loizidou and kapetanios 1993 mor et al 2006 wagh et al 2016b howladar et al 2017 generally domestic sewage runoff from agricultural fields leachate from landfill and septic tanks and distance between source and groundwater affects the nitrate content pawar and shaikh 1995 pujari et al 2012 the nitrate content in groundwater elevates from 25 41 to 75 39mg l and 30 3 84 69mg l with an average value 44 45mg l and 53 21mg l table 1 in pre monsoon and post monsoon season respectively the utmost numbers of samples from pakni site are transcending the permissible limit of the bis i e 40 in pre monsoon and 73 33 in post monsoon season the samples mainly from residential and agriculture area showed the elevated concentration of nitrate the nitrate content at sample numbers 22 23 25 26 27 and 28 found above 45mg l sample number 25 is located in pakni village which is diminished for drinking purpose by public health department due to high content of nitrate and chloride same scenario is also observed at 26 27 and 28 but still they are used for drinking purpose the sample number 25 located near to the septic tank of household sanitation system and open defecation is observed around sample number 26 located just outside to village these two samples also have a high potassium and chloride which is possibly contributed by fertilizers as kcl pawar et al 2008 and should be restricted for drinking purpose the enrichment of chloride and nitrate beyond the permissible level in the samples from agriculture fields corresponding to overuse of nitrogen and chloride fertilizers pawar et al 2008 wagh et al 2017b dey et al 2017 majority of the groundwater samples from this site are above the desirable limit but within the permissible limit of the bis standards bis 10500 2012 in pakni site it is observed that few sample locations are affected from anthropogenic activities like percolation of agricultural salts and waste water 4 3 chincholi site chincholi site is very dynamic in terms of land use pattern differentiated by barren land industrial set up and agriculture the industrial area is sandwiched between barren and agricultural area the agricultural land irrigated through ujani canal water and groundwater due to the industrial setup the population pressure is conveniently ascertained and open defecation is common practice the ph value ranged from 7 8 to 8 8 in both the season the highest values are observed at this site three samples 38 41 and 46 in pre monsoon and six samples 34 35 38 39 40 and 45 in post monsoon season exceeding the range defined by the bis the elevated ph may be due to the percolation of effluent along with rain water the ec values fluctuating from 1730 0 to 11 400 0µs cm with an average 4614 13µs cm in pre monsoon and 1524 0 to 11 300 0µs cm with an average 4260 25µs cm in post monsoon season the high ec values were observed at sample number 39 41 and 42 reflects the leaching of industrial effluents and the dissolution of aquifer minerals kale et al 2010 das et al 2016 sanchez perez and tremolieres 2003 the average concentration of tds is far beyond the desired value of the bis in pre monsoon 1312 91 and 1233 32 post monsoon season contributed by the mixing of surface pollutants in shallow aquifer during the process of percolation and infiltration which restricts the drinking suitability panaskar et al 2016 pius et al 2012 and lakshmikantha 2006 reported that the increased values of physicochemical parameters due to seepage from unlined sewage lines domestic drains and leachate from waste dumps in an industrial area the chloride concentration swerves from 113 6 to 2073 2mg l and 107 98 to 1700 0mg l with an average concentration of 478 44 and 433 35mg l in pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons respectively here 43 75 samples exceeding the desirable limit 250mg l and only 12 5 samples 41 and 44 beat the permissible limit 1000mg l in both the seasons the chloride enrichment at 38 39 40 41 44 and 45 sample locations in chincholi site is primarily attribution of discharged effluent and domestic waste imparts a salty taste to water and laxative effect on human chloride content beyond the permissible limit of the bis 1000mg l may alter the water taste corrosion and palatability and imparts incrustation which limits the applicability which leads to the failure of irrigation equipments bore well pipes water supply system etc due to corrosion problem hauser 2001 gholizadeh et al 2017 pius et al 2012 reported the maximum content of chloride i e 910mg l in close proximity of industries like garments dyeing and printing furnaces glass cement factories and ceramics the nitrate content in groundwater ranges from 24 19 to 83 58mg l with an average 52 15mg l and 29 32 96 6mg l with an average value 56 74mg l table 1 in pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons in chincholi 50 of the samples from each season are found beyond the 45mg l are located along the surface water flow contributed by infiltrating untreated effluents to aquifers the high content of chloride and nitrate observed at sample numbers 35 38 39 40 41 44 and 45 which are located in and around chincholi industrial area the graphical representation of cl no3 and tds illustrates that the values are highest at chincholi than kondi and pakni site the sample number 39 41 and 44 samples have values beyond the permissible limits of the bis depicts the source is of anthropogenic origin fig 2a c the elevated mineralization in industrial is mainly owed to percolation of industrial waste water discharged in simple pits the sample numbers 46 47 48 and 49 are located at the downstream of industrial area but have low contents suggests that the spatial extent is limited and if such practices continued the pollution spread can be enhanced hence unfit for drinking and irrigation as a result chincholi site is under high anthropogenic pressure and the hydrochemistry is affected to a considerable extent which limits the water suitability 4 4 non industrial area analytical result corroborates that surface water is slightly alkaline with an average of about 8 2 and 8 5 in pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons the electrical conductivity ec of the surface water samples ranges from 944 0 to 1500 0µs cm with an average of 1222 0µs cm in pre monsoon and 676 0 to 1290 0µs cm with an average of 983 0µs cm in post monsoon season the ec values are high in pre monsoon season due to the evaporation and the interference of animals and domestic activities the average concentration of total dissolved solids tds varies from 614 94mg l in pre monsoon and 624 04mg l in post monsoon season which is higher than the desirable limit but below the permissible limit of the bis the sodium content varies from 23 2 to 115 0mg l in pre monsoon and 102 4 159 7mg l post monsoon season however all the samples fall below the desirable value defined by the bis the average concentration of sodium is high in post monsoon season may be the attribution of surface runoff from agricultural fields and domestic activities like clothes washing and mixing of animal waste the chloride concentration slews from 99 4 to 225 64mg l in pre monsoon season whereas in post monsoon season ranges from 134 9 to 193 3mg l the average value of cl is 162 52 in pre monsoon and 164 10mg l post monsoon season which is far below from the desirable value 250mg l set by the bis the nitrate content in groundwater ranges from 14 11 to 158 30mg l with an average 86 21mg l in pre monsoon moreover 4 0 43 68mg l with an average value 23 88mg l table 2 in post monsoon season the low concentration of nitrate in post monsoon is owed to the dilution caused by rainwater the graphical representation fig 3a c explores that only nitrate exceeds the permissible limit of the bis in nutshell it confirms that the non industrial area samples s1 and s2 are not affected from industrial activities but affected to a lesser extent due to domestic activities 4 5 industrial area the four water tanks s3 s4 s5 and s6 from the industrial area were selected and analyzed for pre monsoon and post monsoon season of 2015 table 2 the ph value ranges from 5 5 to 8 4 and 4 9 to 8 3 in pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons the average ph value 6 5 in pre monsoon and 6 7 in post monsoon represents the slight acidic nature all the surface water samples exceeds the 2000µs cm value of electrical conductivity ec deviating from 2824 0 to 9000 0 µs cm with an average 6716 75µs cm in pre monsoon whereas 2802 0 8500 0µs cm with an average 6741 50µs cm in post monsoon season the soaring average of ec in pre monsoon and post monsoon were observed at sample number s4 7532 0µs cm s5 7821 0µs cm and s6 8750 0µs cm the high ec reflects the mixing of effluents in these surface water bodies and field observation supports the results kale et al 2010 the tds is exceptionally high and its average concentration ranges from 3421 77 in pre monsoon and 3481 37 in post monsoon season the average tds is far above the permissible limit of the bis which limits the suitability for all type of uses high concentration of tds is contributed by the amalgamation of surface runoff and direct discharge of industrial effluents into water tanks pius et al 2012 panaskar et al 2016 the chloride concentration varies widely from 546 7 to 3964 7mg l in pre monsoon and 931 9 2747 7mg l in post monsoon seasons with an average concentration of 1741 53 and 1597 38mg l respectively all samples exceed the desirable limit while average concentration is far above the permissible limit of the bis the nitrate content ranges from 126 38 to 306 75mg l with an average 201 13mg l and 114 58 to 312 59mg l with an average value 193 97mg l table 2 in both the seasons the nitrate is beyond the permissible limit prescribed by the bis 45mg l the average values of tds cl and no3 are above the permissible limits of the bis which clench the water appropriateness for domestic and agriculture fig 3a c the comparative assessment of non industrial and industrial surface water samples clearly illustrates that the untreated effluent is mixed into the surface water tanks the sample number s6 is worst affected may be due to the mixing recharging from the common effluent treatment plant the field observation reveals that these sites appear as wastewater storage rather than surface water tanks such dejectedly polluted water tanks will act as plausible source of contamination to aquifers tapped below it therefore there is heavy need to treat these water tanks with proper water treatment measures 4 6 spatial variation of chloride and nitrate the spatio temporal maps of nitrate illustrated that only three samples positioned on the edge of industrial area from kondi site 7 17 and 18 have high values than others due to the unmanaged sewerage and domestic waste drainage the irrigation potential of pakni site is quite good and its one the cause of nitrate enrichment in both the seasons the south west region is enriched with nitrate where all the surface water streams confluences with seena river due to percolation and leaching of agricultural runoff and animal waste from the watershed the spatial extent of nitrate and chloride in chincholi industrial area represents that sample have very high values sample numbers 34 35 38 39 40 41 and 44 located adjacent to pharmaceutical cement and metallurgical industries fig 4 the spatial extent of chloride is increased mainly in industrial and agricultural areas in both the seasons however the mobility of chloride is more in post monsoon season as the on land discharged effluent is transported with surface runoff to natural drainage system as a result few samples are extremely polluted in industrial area the significant directional growth of chloride content is easily observed along with surface water flow illustrated by sample number 41 and 44 fig 5 the discharged effluent from industries flows with the natural course of water and infiltrated into the aquifers sample number 44 and 45 evidencing the above said situation as they exceeds the permissible limits which are located along the nannaj stream the same scenario is found in the case of 38 39 40 and 41 sample number the sample number 20 21 and 22 are contaminated due to the percolation of discharged waste water in surface water tank 4 7 piper plot piper 1944 developed the concept of hydro geochemical facies in order to understand the composition of ions chemical history of water and its source visualizing trends of groundwater chemistry it also helps to identify chemical processes and the evolution of the groundwater in the aquifer due to the residence and flow through aquifer media the evaluation of hydrochemical plot is endeavored by trilinear plot piper diagram of groundwater samples is provided in fig 6 the hydrochemical analysis confirms that alkaline earth ca mg exceeds the alkalis na k and strong acid so4 cl dominate over weak acid co3 hco3 in pre and post monsoon the dominating cations are ca na k and mg and the dominating anions are cl and hco3 in both the season the dominance of such ions affects the salinity of water 4 8 gibbs plot gibbs 1970 defined the ratio of cations and anions vs tds to identify the impact of dominant processes such as rock water interaction evaporation and precipitation the chemical data of groundwater sample are plotted in the gibbs diagram to authenticate the dominating processes in the study area fig 7 the fig 7 illustrates that almost all the samples in both the season fall in evaporation dominance field the study area experiences semi arid climate as well as anthropogenic inputs like agricultural industrial and domestic activities affecting the groundwater quality at few locations 4 9 correlation analysis the correlation matrix infers the relationships between two or more variables and commonly used to identify the degree of correlation among the different parameters of groundwater quality cl and no3 are strongly correlated with ec ca mg na so4 and no3 hence contributing to the salinity of water in both the seasons the negative correlation of cl with co3 and hco3 indicates the anthropogenic origin of chloride in pre monsoon season the chloride has strong association with ec 0 897 no3 0 642 and tds 0 965 it supports the dominancy of chloride ions as depicted in piper plot the strong positive correlation has been found between cl and no3 in pre monsoon 0 642 and post monsoon 0 576 monsoon season it signifies the source of origin of chloride and nitrate may be same i e domestic sewage agriculture waste and industrial waste water mahlknecht et al 2008 the elevated nitrate and chloride content corresponds with intensive agriculture and discharge of industrial effluents and application nitrogen containing fertilizers as additional source pawar et al 2008 4 10 cluster analysis the k means clustering algorithm is used for partitioning the groups of similar composition amongst a multivariate data set the cluster analysis of groundwater samples fig 8 illustrates that cluster 1 classify the samples affected by the industrial effluents through percolation therefore the sample numbers 39 41and 42 forms the single cluster these samples are highly polluted and located nearby the industrial area therefore the differences between the chemistry of the clusters are narrow the second cluster is composed of 22 25 26 27 28 38 39 and 40 which are located in pakni and chincholi site these samples are moderately polluted by agricultural and domestic activities the samples from kondi site falls in cluster 3 in both the season indicating the uniform chemistry throughout the seasons while majority of the samples from pakni and chincholi falls in cluster 2 representing changes in groundwater chemistry in nutshell cluster analysis grouped the samples into less polluted moderately polluted and severely polluted 5 conclusions groundwater and surface water chemistry has been evaluated to identify the impacts of anthropogenic activities in chincholi industrial area at kondi pakni and chincholi sites the overall interpretation of hydrochemical analysis infers the groundwater is feebly alkaline and surface water from industrial area is slightly acidic in nature in both the seasons the groundwater quality is significantly influenced by industrial effluent agricultural and domestic waste at chincholi and pakni site while less significant imprints observed at kondi site due to the diminutive industrial and agricultural inputs the chloride and nitrate are the main contributors in groundwater pollution at chincholi and pakni site where majority of the samples found beyond the desired content set by the bis the inputs of cl and no3 are of anthropogenic origin as chincholi and pakni sites are adversely affected rather than the kondi site which infers that the discharged untreated effluents and agricultural waste are the possible sources of contamination the groundwater quality in post monsoon season is affected mainly from chloride and nitrate due to the fast movement of contaminants along with recharging water through the fractures and joints this is evidenced by the contamination of dug wells is more than the bore wells the groundwater quality is controlled by alkaline earth ca mg and strong acid so4 cl in both the season with evaporation dominance the strong positive correlation between chloride and nitrate signifies the same source of origin while the samples polluted due to industrial effluents forms the isolated clusters the spatial distribution map represents the extent and severity of contaminants and to develop the standard system to reduce the potential effect the high content of chloride nitrate and tds in chincholi industrial area and in south west region at pakni is owed to the leaching of contaminants from industrial effluents agricultural waste and open defecation to overcome the contamination problems the aquifer can be recharged using natural water by construction on bunds in theses area the surface water tanks from industrial are affected due to the discharge of untreated or partially treated effluents while those away from industrial area found in their natural state it signifies that industrial effluent is one of the key source contaminating the groundwater and surface water along with open defecation and agricultural waste the waste water from industries should be treated at least primary treatment prior to discharge into land water bodies in agricultural areas the dug wells and bore wells are not protected from agricultural runoff thus contaminated water enters directly into the aquifer which signifies the proper measures need to be taken the common drainage in villages are not properly concretized which increases the risk of contamination for the better management of water quality industries should initiate the zero discharge concepts and people should exercise the proper sanitation systems to diminish contamination problems the findings of this study will help to identify the critical sites of elevated risk to water quality and to prioritize the areas for further policy development to avoid any health impacts acknowledgement the work was funded by department of science and technology dst grant no

12322,a comprehensive hydrochemical study has been carried out to evaluate the impact of anthropogenic activities like industrial effluents open defecation and untreated sewerage disposal on groundwater and surface water in chincholi industrial area the study area comprises of 3 sites viz kondi pakni and chincholi with approximate 7000 population and out of that 81 defecates openly many industries release effluent in simple pits and surface water tanks without any prior treatment and people harness water from contaminated aquifers a total 55 water samples have been collected during pre and post monsoon seasons of 2015 according to the bis at many sample locations the contents of th ca na cl no3 and tds exceeded the desirable limit the piper plot suggests that alkaline earth exceeds the alkalis and strong acid dominate over weak acid in pre and post monsoon however elevated contents of nitrate and chloride in post monsoon season are owed to increased percolation of effluent and agricultural waste along with the recharging water the strong positive correlation between cl no3 and tds represents the contamination is of anthropogenic origin supported by the cluster analysis by forming three different clusters all the parameters exceed the safe limits of the bis in surface water samples from industrial area due to the mixing of untreated effluents while the samples from non industrial area remain unpolluted the study concludes that the anthropogenic activities like sewerage disposal open defecation and discharged effluent disposal threatening the groundwater and surface water quality few aquifers from chincholi and pakni site are affected most due to industrial effluent and agricultural waste while few samples from kondi site are polluted due to unlined drainage to overcome the problem discharged waste water should be treated and enhancement of sanitation systems along with best management practices in agriculture is essential graphical abstract fx1 keywords groundwater surface water sewage effluent discharge bis chincholi industrial area 1 introduction water is a key component for the sustainable development of the society the arid and semiarid regions around the world are facing great challenge of satisfying demands of the water for drinking industrial and agriculture zhang 2014 the groundwater is considered to be safe source for drinking due to its natural quality consistent temperature and less susceptibility as compared with other fresh water resources therefore many people depends on groundwater sources such as dug well bore well hand pumps etc for drinking and domestic purpose recently it is evident that groundwater quality and quantity are posing significant threats due to over extraction and anthropogenic inputs generally groundwater quality is influenced by geogenic factors like composition of host rock rock and water interaction residence time climate etc and hydrogeological factors such as water table depth soil matrix and anthropogenic activities includes domestic agricultural and industrial wastes todd and mays 2005 lawrence et al 2001 kumar et al 2009 sorensen et al 2016 keesari et al 2016

prüss ustün et al 2014 water borne pathogens infect around 250 million people per year leads to 10 20 million deaths and many of these infections occur in developing countries that face sanitation problems anon 1996 dzwairo et al 2006 globally it is projected that around 10 disease burdens particularly among children under five years old up until now one billion people still practice open defection around the world includes over 600 million in india sorensen et al 2016 who unicef 2014 who 2012 in low income communities installation of sewerage system is unfeasible as it requires significant capital investment and a piped water supply therefore pit latrines and pour flush toilets usually adopted paterson et al 2007 as concern with the population pressure in india it is rather difficult to install centralized water supply and waste water treatment system which requires large capital investment national environmental and engineering research institute india neeri conducted study of ten cities in the country concludes that groundwater pollution occur due to on site sanitation system relates to unconfined and to a lesser degree to semi confined aquifers while deep and confined aquifers remains unaffected the fractured rock aquifers are more susceptible to pollution as compared with alluvium aquifers also confirms that the hydrogeological setup of the area plays a crucial role in the pollution dispersion from on site sanitation neeri 2005 sorensen et al 2016 corroborated that in bihar state of india the groundwater is polluted from fecal coliforms due to the lack of sanitary seals headworks and subsurface installation shivendra and ramaraju 2015 investigated that on site sanitation system in peri urban areas of bangalore city are increasing the concentration of chloride nitrate and total dissolved solids is owed to the disposal of septic tank effluents along with sullage water in open drains similar investigation was reported by templeton et al 2015 in peri urban area of african cities found that the nitrate content is elevated beyond the who permissible limit within short period to a considerable depth of aquifer 50m due to the pit latrines back et al 2018 reported enrichment of nitrate content and microbiological contamination in developing country due to improper sanitation systems while high albeit low concentration nitrate correlated with some radial metrics confirms the mixing of latrine effluents the industrial effluents need treatment and purification setup however to avoid such capital costs many industries discharge their effluents into simple pits open space water body etc such effluent is drained by rain water over longer distance which increases lateral and vertical spread of contaminates in aquifer which raise serious environmental threats kumar and shah 2006 ramaraju 2009 chintalapudi et al 2017 minhas et al 2004 stated that in india only 24 of wastewater treated with primary treatment before its disposal into river water or use for agriculture including metro cities such partially treated wastewater causes environmental implications as surface water and groundwater contamination soil degradation and contamination of crops grown on polluted water mccornick et al 2004 scott et al 2004 the water resources are vulnerable to nitrate and chloride contamination due to continuous loading of nitrate from agricultural domestic industrial waste etc naik et al 2008 investigated the impact of urbanization on groundwater quality is deteriorated due to the seepages of unlined sewage lines domestic drains and leachate from waste dumps in solapur city however dug wells are more susceptible to nitrate pollution as compared with bore wells the several studies throughout india confirmed the infiltration of industrial effluents is a serious cause of aquifer contamination rao et al 2001 sobha and anish 2003 pujari and deshpande 2005 singh et al 2006 naik et al 2007 pujari et al 2007 pius et al 2012 kalpana and elango 2013 mukate et al 2015 wagh et al 2016a saba et al 2016 many researchers proved that the anthropogenic activities are affecting the groundwater quality primarily from

prepare a baseline data for futuristic comparative assessment and monitoring of water resources from chincholi industrial area the need of hydro geochemical aspects in relation to industrial and sanitation aspects was not recognized manifestly in the study area however few studies carried out by nodal agencies like groundwater survey and development agency gsda and central ground water board cgwb as a part of the regional study and individuals to a limited extent naik et al 2008 pawar et al 2014 mukate et al 2015 in the present study the hydrochemical investigations have been carried out at three different sites i e kondi pakni and chincholi to find out the lateral and vertical spread of pollution and its sources the objectives of the present study are i to recognize the impacts of anthropogenic inputs and assess the seasonal variations in shallow and deep aquifer and surface water quality ii to assess the concentration of critical parameters like nitrate chloride and total dissolved solids iii to identify the lateral and vertical spread of pollution and possible sources of contaminants increasing the risk of human health and environmental resource degradation 2 study

longitude and 17 40 to 17 50 n latitude the study area comprises very gentle slope in ne sw direction solapur city is well known for textile industries it concern with dyeing and bleaching processes which contributes pollutants in surface water and aquifer system since 1990 the maharashtra industrial development corporation midc have developed the chincholi industrial area 1028 30 ha with industries viz chemical dyeing bleaching oil pharmaceutical food processing metallurgical etc the study area comprised of three villages viz kondi pakni and chincholi with population around 7000 and uses groundwater for domestic purpose the kondi site is situated in upper catchment with limited agricultural land and very small industrial activities with inadequate sanitation system the pakni village is located on the bank of seena river however this area is irrigated through seena river ujni canal water and groundwater the major growing crops are sugarcane jowar wheat soybean etc the maximum area of chincholi site is occupied by industries which discharged untreated effluent in natural drainages and in small pits are discernible at many places the study area characterized as a sub tropical monsoon climate and 87 annual rainfall receives from south west monsoonal winds june september with an average annual rainfall 677mm the temperature deflects from 13 c to 40 c in winter and summer season cgwb 2014 geologically the study area is composed of basaltic lava flows of aa and pahoehoe types of late cretaceous to paleogene age 68 62 million years with narrow strip of alluvium along river and streams gsi 2002 the massive unit constitutes 60 85 of basaltic flows fine grained dense and compact possessing low primary porosity and permeability with inhomogeneous and anisotropic nature the vesicular unit form upper horizon constitutes 15 40 of basaltic flows are soft fine grained and holding high primary porosity and permeability due to vesicles the vesicles leads to primary porosity and filled with secondary minerals viz zeolites quartz and calcite the weathered portions of vesicular and massive units have good porosity and permeability ground water occurs at 10 15m depth and potential zones are encountered at 60 80m due to fractures with inter flow zones cgwb 2014 3 materials and methodology to know the impact of anthropogenic activities on water quality and pollution sources water sample locations are segregated into three sites viz kondi pakni and chincholi non industrial and industrial area a total of 55 water samples were collected from industrial residential and agricultural area during pre monsoon and post monsoon season of 2015 out of 55 water samples 6 are surface water samples collected from non industrial n 2 and industrial n 4 areas and 49 groundwater samples collected from shallow and deep aquifers located in kondi n 18 pakni n 15 and chincholi n 16 site table 1 the water samples were collected from shallow dug wells and deep aquifers bore well hand pumps which are used for domestic and agricultural purpose the samples were collected in pre washed one liter polyethylene narrow mouth cans after pumping the wells for 5 10min prior to sampling the cans were pretreated with acid and rinsed with water for 2 3 times to avoid any contamination afterwards these cans were sealed labeled and brought to laboratory for analysis the ph and ec values were recorded in field itself by using portable digital meter multi parameter pcs tester 35 the rest of physicochemical parameters such as ca mg co3 hco3 and cl were analyzed in the laboratory by gravimetric analysis following the standard methods of american public health association apha 2005 the sodium na and potassium k ions were determined by using flame photometer elico cl

statistical analysis is performed through statistical package for social sciences spss 22 0 software 1 c b e c a t i o n s a n i o n s c a t i o n s a n i o n s 100 4 result and discussion the descriptive statistics of analytical results of groundwater and surface water samples are summarized in tables 1 and 2 4 1 kondi site the kondi site is characterized as barren land with diminutive anthropogenic activities due to the limited water availability this site has minuscule industrial and agricultural activities and groundwater is the only source to meet the demand of industrial agriculture and domestic activities analytical results inferred that ph value varied from 8 0 to 8 7 in pre monsoon and 8 0 8 5 in post monsoon season which indicates feebly alkaline nature three samples sample numbers 6 7 and 13 found beyond the bis limits in pre monsoon season owed to loss of co2 and precipitation of mineral salts pawar and kale 2006 the ph value of natural groundwater ranges from 6 0 to 9 0 mainly influenced by carbon dioxide microbial activity and plant photosynthesis brian et al 1999 horne and goldman 1994 the ec value denotes the amount of dissolved salts due to leaching of aquifer media or mixing of other sources such as sea water intrusion or waste water seeping the groundwater samples have ec in the range of 1056 0 3762 0µs cm avg 1847 µs cm in pre monsoon and 966 0 3320 0µs cm avg 1825 00µs cm in post monsoon season represents the moderate mineralization of aquifers the average concentration of tds is 642 78mg l in pre monsoon and 681 58mg l in post monsoon season which is beyond the desirable limit but below the permissible limit of the bis bis 10500 2012 the high tds value limits the potability of water and may cause the gastro intestinal irritation in human the chloride is one of the major anion mainly contributed by geogenic weathering of sodalite apatite micas and hornblende minerals and anthropogenic sewage seawater and saline residues in soil sources hem 1991 the chloride content in groundwater samples is far below the permissible limits of the bis swerves from 39 76 to 187 44mg l in pre monsoon and 48 6 190 46mg l in post monsoon seasons the low chloride content signifies that study area is devoid of geogenic sources and not affected from anthropogenic activities the nitrate content in groundwater deflects from 18 3 to 51 24mg l with an average 30 57mg l in pre monsoon and 21 29 61 46mg l with an average value 35 32mg l in post monsoon season the average content of nitrate is increased in post monsoon despite the dissolution from recharge water similar findings have been reported by neeri report 2005 pujari et al 2007 2012 the concentration of nitrate decreases with lowering water table wherein anaerobic conditions are prevailed where nitrate is partially converted to nitrogen lawrence et al 2001 the quality of groundwater in deccan volcanic province dvp is dominated by ca mg hco3 but during monsoon the groundwater is recharged with chloride sulfate nitrate sodium calcium magnesium and negligible amounts of bicarbonates das et al 2004 the increased concentration of chloride and nitrate in post monsoon season is owed to the runoff from domestic and agricultural fields the sample numbers 7 17 and 18 have high nitrate concentration 45mg l which is due to the nonexistence of concrete sewerage line poor sanitary seals and incompetent casing as compared with the bis standards all the parameters are within permissible limit except nitrate content suggests the drinking feasibility fig 2a c the overall results pinpointing that the aquifers of this site are well maintained in their natural state while few have diminutive impact of anthropogenic inputs 4 2 pakni site the pakni site is under extensive agriculture and irrigated through seena river water ujani canal water and groundwater situated to the sw of chincholi industrial area the ph value varied from 7 9 to 8 5 and 7 88 to 8 4 in pre and post monsoon season which suggests slight alkaline nature the majority of the samples fall within the bis limit and natural ph range of groundwater the ec values of the groundwater samples range from 2136 0 to 5347 0µs cm with an average 3495 73µs cm in pre monsoon whereas 2016 0 5600 0µs cm with an average 3620 80µs cm in post monsoon season the high average concentration represents the increased mineralization which elevates the salinity of groundwater the average concentration of total dissolved solids tds is high in pre monsoon 1126 39mg l than post monsoon season 1095 28mg l due to the dissolution of salts and evaporation of water all the groundwater samples are above the desirable level and below the permissible limit of the bis fig 2a c it is illustrated that the concentration of tds is increased as compared with kondi site can be attributed to salts leached from agricultural fields the chloride concentration varies from 117 86 to 539 6mg l and 139 16 546 7mg l with average value of 278 86 in pre monsoon and 268 73mg l in post monsoon season the graphical representation depicts that the pakni site shows elevated concentration may be due to the infiltration of salts along with recharging water is especially anthropogenic however 46 66 samples from pakni site are above the desirable limit of chloride are augmentation of domestic agricultural waste the sample number 20 21 and 22 are may be affected due to percolation of contaminants from surface water sampling site s3 and 25 26 and 27 due to inputs from the domestic drainage agricultural waste and open defecation high chloride content in groundwater may result from natural and anthropogenic sources viz weathering of halite mineral domestic effluent fertilizers septic tanks and leachate from landfills sites loizidou and kapetanios 1993 mor et al 2006 wagh et al 2016b howladar et al 2017 generally domestic sewage runoff from agricultural fields leachate from landfill and septic tanks and distance between source and groundwater affects the nitrate content pawar and shaikh 1995 pujari et al 2012 the nitrate content in groundwater elevates from 25 41 to 75 39mg l and 30 3 84 69mg l with an average value 44 45mg l and 53 21mg l table 1 in pre monsoon and post monsoon season respectively the utmost numbers of samples from pakni site are transcending the permissible limit of the bis i e 40 in pre monsoon and 73 33 in post monsoon season the samples mainly from residential and agriculture area showed the elevated concentration of nitrate the nitrate content at sample numbers 22 23 25 26 27 and 28 found above 45mg l sample number 25 is located in pakni village which is diminished for drinking purpose by public health department due to high content of nitrate and chloride same scenario is also observed at 26 27 and 28 but still they are used for drinking purpose the sample number 25 located near to the septic tank of household sanitation system and open defecation is observed around sample number 26 located just outside to village these two samples also have a high potassium and chloride which is possibly contributed by fertilizers as kcl pawar et al 2008 and should be restricted for drinking purpose the enrichment of chloride and nitrate beyond the permissible level in the samples from agriculture fields corresponding to overuse of nitrogen and chloride fertilizers pawar et al 2008 wagh et al 2017b dey et al 2017 majority of the groundwater samples from this site are above the desirable limit but within the permissible limit of the bis standards bis 10500 2012 in pakni site it is observed that few sample locations are affected from anthropogenic activities like percolation of agricultural salts and waste water 4 3 chincholi site chincholi site is very dynamic in terms of land use pattern differentiated by barren land industrial set up and agriculture the industrial area is sandwiched between barren and agricultural area the agricultural land irrigated through ujani canal water and groundwater due to the industrial setup the population pressure is conveniently ascertained and open defecation is common practice the ph value ranged from 7 8 to 8 8 in both the season the highest values are observed at this site three samples 38 41 and 46 in pre monsoon and six samples 34 35 38 39 40 and 45 in post monsoon season exceeding the range defined by the bis the elevated ph may be due to the percolation of effluent along with rain water the ec values fluctuating from 1730 0 to 11 400 0µs cm with an average 4614 13µs cm in pre monsoon and 1524 0 to 11 300 0µs cm with an average 4260 25µs cm in post monsoon season the high ec values were observed at sample number 39 41 and 42 reflects the leaching of industrial effluents and the dissolution of aquifer minerals kale et al 2010 das et al 2016 sanchez perez and tremolieres 2003 the average concentration of tds is far beyond the desired value of the bis in pre monsoon 1312 91 and 1233 32 post monsoon season contributed by the mixing of surface pollutants in shallow aquifer during the process of percolation and infiltration which restricts the drinking suitability panaskar et al 2016 pius et al 2012 and lakshmikantha 2006 reported that the increased values of physicochemical parameters due to seepage from unlined sewage lines domestic drains and leachate from waste dumps in an industrial area the chloride concentration swerves from 113 6 to 2073 2mg l and 107 98 to 1700 0mg l with an average concentration of 478 44 and 433 35mg l in pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons respectively here 43 75 samples exceeding the desirable limit 250mg l and only 12 5 samples 41 and 44 beat the permissible limit 1000mg l in both the seasons the chloride enrichment at 38 39 40 41 44 and 45 sample locations in chincholi site is primarily attribution of discharged effluent and domestic waste imparts a salty taste to water and laxative effect on human chloride content beyond the permissible limit of the bis 1000mg l may alter the water taste corrosion and palatability and imparts incrustation which limits the applicability which leads to the failure of irrigation equipments bore well pipes water supply system etc due to corrosion problem hauser 2001 gholizadeh et al 2017 pius et al 2012 reported the maximum content of chloride i e 910mg l in close proximity of industries like garments dyeing and printing furnaces glass cement factories and ceramics the nitrate content in groundwater ranges from 24 19 to 83 58mg l with an average 52 15mg l and 29 32 96 6mg l with an average value 56 74mg l table 1 in pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons in chincholi 50 of the samples from each season are found beyond the 45mg l are located along the surface water flow contributed by infiltrating untreated effluents to aquifers the high content of chloride and nitrate observed at sample numbers 35 38 39 40 41 44 and 45 which are located in and around chincholi industrial area the graphical representation of cl no3 and tds illustrates that the values are highest at chincholi than kondi and pakni site the sample number 39 41 and 44 samples have values beyond the permissible limits of the bis depicts the source is of anthropogenic origin fig 2a c the elevated mineralization in industrial is mainly owed to percolation of industrial waste water discharged in simple pits the sample numbers 46 47 48 and 49 are located at the downstream of industrial area but have low contents suggests that the spatial extent is limited and if such practices continued the pollution spread can be enhanced hence unfit for drinking and irrigation as a result chincholi site is under high anthropogenic pressure and the hydrochemistry is affected to a considerable extent which limits the water suitability 4 4 non industrial area analytical result corroborates that surface water is slightly alkaline with an average of about 8 2 and 8 5 in pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons the electrical conductivity ec of the surface water samples ranges from 944 0 to 1500 0µs cm with an average of 1222 0µs cm in pre monsoon and 676 0 to 1290 0µs cm with an average of 983 0µs cm in post monsoon season the ec values are high in pre monsoon season due to the evaporation and the interference of animals and domestic activities the average concentration of total dissolved solids tds varies from 614 94mg l in pre monsoon and 624 04mg l in post monsoon season which is higher than the desirable limit but below the permissible limit of the bis the sodium content varies from 23 2 to 115 0mg l in pre monsoon and 102 4 159 7mg l post monsoon season however all the samples fall below the desirable value defined by the bis the average concentration of sodium is high in post monsoon season may be the attribution of surface runoff from agricultural fields and domestic activities like clothes washing and mixing of animal waste the chloride concentration slews from 99 4 to 225 64mg l in pre monsoon season whereas in post monsoon season ranges from 134 9 to 193 3mg l the average value of cl is 162 52 in pre monsoon and 164 10mg l post monsoon season which is far below from the desirable value 250mg l set by the bis the nitrate content in groundwater ranges from 14 11 to 158 30mg l with an average 86 21mg l in pre monsoon moreover 4 0 43 68mg l with an average value 23 88mg l table 2 in post monsoon season the low concentration of nitrate in post monsoon is owed to the dilution caused by rainwater the graphical representation fig 3a c explores that only nitrate exceeds the permissible limit of the bis in nutshell it confirms that the non industrial area samples s1 and s2 are not affected from industrial activities but affected to a lesser extent due to domestic activities 4 5 industrial area the four water tanks s3 s4 s5 and s6 from the industrial area were selected and analyzed for pre monsoon and post monsoon season of 2015 table 2 the ph value ranges from 5 5 to 8 4 and 4 9 to 8 3 in pre monsoon and post monsoon seasons the average ph value 6 5 in pre monsoon and 6 7 in post monsoon represents the slight acidic nature all the surface water samples exceeds the 2000µs cm value of electrical conductivity ec deviating from 2824 0 to 9000 0 µs cm with an average 6716 75µs cm in pre monsoon whereas 2802 0 8500 0µs cm with an average 6741 50µs cm in post monsoon season the soaring average of ec in pre monsoon and post monsoon were observed at sample number s4 7532 0µs cm s5 7821 0µs cm and s6 8750 0µs cm the high ec reflects the mixing of effluents in these surface water bodies and field observation supports the results kale et al 2010 the tds is exceptionally high and its average concentration ranges from 3421 77 in pre monsoon and 3481 37 in post monsoon season the average tds is far above the permissible limit of the bis which limits the suitability for all type of uses high concentration of tds is contributed by the amalgamation of surface runoff and direct discharge of industrial effluents into water tanks pius et al 2012 panaskar et al 2016 the chloride concentration varies widely from 546 7 to 3964 7mg l in pre monsoon and 931 9 2747 7mg l in post monsoon seasons with an average concentration of 1741 53 and 1597 38mg l respectively all samples exceed the desirable limit while average concentration is far above the permissible limit of the bis the nitrate content ranges from 126 38 to 306 75mg l with an average 201 13mg l and 114 58 to 312 59mg l with an average value 193 97mg l table 2 in both the seasons the nitrate is beyond the permissible limit prescribed by the bis 45mg l the average values of tds cl and no3 are above the permissible limits of the bis which clench the water appropriateness for domestic and agriculture fig 3a c the comparative assessment of non industrial and industrial surface water samples clearly illustrates that the untreated effluent is mixed into the surface water tanks the sample number s6 is worst affected may be due to the mixing recharging from the common effluent treatment plant the field observation reveals that these sites appear as wastewater storage rather than surface water tanks such dejectedly polluted water tanks will act as plausible source of contamination to aquifers tapped below it therefore there is heavy need to treat these water tanks with proper water treatment measures 4 6 spatial variation of chloride and nitrate the spatio temporal maps of nitrate illustrated that only three samples positioned on the edge of industrial area from kondi site 7 17 and 18 have high values than others due to the unmanaged sewerage and domestic waste drainage the irrigation potential of pakni site is quite good and its one the cause of nitrate enrichment in both the seasons the south west region is enriched with nitrate where all the surface water streams confluences with seena river due to percolation and leaching of agricultural runoff and animal waste from the watershed the spatial extent of nitrate and chloride in chincholi industrial area represents that sample have very high values sample numbers 34 35 38 39 40 41 and 44 located adjacent to pharmaceutical cement and metallurgical industries fig 4 the spatial extent of chloride is increased mainly in industrial and agricultural areas in both the seasons however the mobility of chloride is more in post monsoon season as the on land discharged effluent is transported with surface runoff to natural drainage system as a result few samples are extremely polluted in industrial area the significant directional growth of chloride content is easily observed along with surface water flow illustrated by sample number 41 and 44 fig 5 the discharged effluent from industries flows with the natural course of water and infiltrated into the aquifers sample number 44 and 45 evidencing the above said situation as they exceeds the permissible limits which are located along the nannaj stream the same scenario is found in the case of 38 39 40 and 41 sample number the sample number 20 21 and 22 are contaminated due to the percolation of discharged waste water in surface water tank 4 7 piper plot piper 1944 developed the concept of hydro geochemical facies in order to understand the composition of ions chemical history of water and its source visualizing trends of groundwater chemistry it also helps to identify chemical processes and the evolution of the groundwater in the aquifer due to the residence and flow through aquifer media the evaluation of hydrochemical plot is endeavored by trilinear plot piper diagram of groundwater samples is provided in fig 6 the hydrochemical analysis confirms that alkaline earth ca mg exceeds the alkalis na k and strong acid so4 cl dominate over weak acid co3 hco3 in pre and post monsoon the dominating cations are ca na k and mg and the dominating anions are cl and hco3 in both the season the dominance of such ions affects the salinity of water 4 8 gibbs plot gibbs 1970 defined the ratio of cations and anions vs tds to identify the impact of dominant processes such as rock water interaction evaporation and precipitation the chemical data of groundwater sample are plotted in the gibbs diagram to authenticate the dominating processes in the study area fig 7 the fig 7 illustrates that almost all the samples in both the season fall in evaporation dominance field the study area experiences semi arid climate as well as anthropogenic inputs like agricultural industrial and domestic activities affecting the groundwater quality at few locations 4 9 correlation analysis the correlation matrix infers the relationships between two or more variables and commonly used to identify the degree of correlation among the different parameters of groundwater quality cl and no3 are strongly correlated with ec ca mg na so4 and no3 hence contributing to the salinity of water in both the seasons the negative correlation of cl with co3 and hco3 indicates the anthropogenic origin of chloride in pre monsoon season the chloride has strong association with ec 0 897 no3 0 642 and tds 0 965 it supports the dominancy of chloride ions as depicted in piper plot the strong positive correlation has been found between cl and no3 in pre monsoon 0 642 and post monsoon 0 576 monsoon season it signifies the source of origin of chloride and nitrate may be same i e domestic sewage agriculture waste and industrial waste water mahlknecht et al 2008 the elevated nitrate and chloride content corresponds with intensive agriculture and discharge of industrial effluents and application nitrogen containing fertilizers as additional source pawar et al 2008 4 10 cluster analysis the k means clustering algorithm is used for partitioning the groups of similar composition amongst a multivariate data set the cluster analysis of groundwater samples fig 8 illustrates that cluster 1 classify the samples affected by the industrial effluents through percolation therefore the sample numbers 39 41and 42 forms the single cluster these samples are highly polluted and located nearby the industrial area therefore the differences between the chemistry of the clusters are narrow the second cluster is composed of 22 25 26 27 28 38 39 and 40 which are located in pakni and chincholi site these samples are moderately polluted by agricultural and domestic activities the samples from kondi site falls in cluster 3 in both the season indicating the uniform chemistry throughout the seasons while majority of the samples from pakni and chincholi falls in cluster 2 representing changes in groundwater chemistry in nutshell cluster analysis grouped the samples into less polluted moderately polluted and severely polluted 5 conclusions groundwater and surface water chemistry has been evaluated to identify the impacts of anthropogenic activities in chincholi industrial area at kondi pakni and chincholi sites the overall interpretation of hydrochemical analysis infers the groundwater is feebly alkaline and surface water from industrial area is slightly acidic in nature in both the seasons the groundwater quality is significantly influenced by industrial effluent agricultural and domestic waste at chincholi and pakni site while less significant imprints observed at kondi site due to the diminutive industrial and agricultural inputs the chloride and nitrate are the main contributors in groundwater pollution at chincholi and pakni site where majority of the samples found beyond the desired content set by the bis the inputs of cl and no3 are of anthropogenic origin as chincholi and pakni sites are adversely affected rather than the kondi site which infers that the discharged untreated effluents and agricultural waste are the possible sources of contamination the groundwater quality in post monsoon season is affected mainly from chloride and nitrate due to the fast movement of contaminants along with recharging water through the fractures and joints this is evidenced by the contamination of dug wells is more than the bore wells the groundwater quality is controlled by alkaline earth ca mg and strong acid so4 cl in both the season with evaporation dominance the strong positive correlation between chloride and nitrate signifies the same source of origin while the samples polluted due to industrial effluents forms the isolated clusters the spatial distribution map represents the extent and severity of contaminants and to develop the standard system to reduce the potential effect the high content of chloride nitrate and tds in chincholi industrial area and in south west region at pakni is owed to the leaching of contaminants from industrial effluents agricultural waste and open defecation to overcome the contamination problems the aquifer can be recharged using natural water by construction on bunds in theses area the surface water tanks from industrial are affected due to the discharge of untreated or partially treated effluents while those away from industrial area found in their natural state it signifies that industrial effluent is one of the key source contaminating the groundwater and surface water along with open defecation and agricultural waste the waste water from industries should be treated at least primary treatment prior to discharge into land water bodies in agricultural areas the dug wells and bore wells are not protected from agricultural runoff thus contaminated water enters directly into the aquifer which signifies the proper measures need to be taken the common drainage in villages are not properly concretized which increases the risk of contamination for the better management of water quality industries should initiate the zero discharge concepts and people should exercise the proper sanitation systems to diminish contamination problems the findings of this study will help to identify the critical sites of elevated risk to water quality and to prioritize the areas for further policy development to avoid any health impacts acknowledgement the work was funded by department of science and technology dst grant no

12323,hydrochemical investigation had been carried out along the foothills of courtallam to understand the predominant processes along the mountain front mf and the riparian zone rz to unravel this process 21 number of mf samples and 32 number of rz samples were collected and analyzed for major ions using standard procedures the bivariate plot of selected parameters indicate most of the mf samples have lesser ionic strength higher partial pressure of carbon dioxide log pco2 value less ph and release more silica during weathering than that of the rz samples furthermore impact of agriculture and feldspar weathering is also noted in the mf regions and the urban sewage signatures are found in few samples of mf and rz region most of the rz samples are represented by state of saturation to super saturation with respect to carbonate minerals thermodynamically the mf samples are more stable near the kaolinite boundaries in the silicate stabilities fields the main factors governing the geochemistry of both the regions are interplay of leaching and dissolution weathering and agriculture it was also inferred that land use and lithology play a significant role in groundwater composition of the region graphical abstract fx1 keywords ion relation thermodynamics factor analysis land use pattern 1 introduction since the last century population growth and climate change have increased the need for the preventive management of groundwater knowledge of the groundwater quality and recharge quantification is a basic prerequisite for efficient groundwater resource management geochemical processes occurring within the groundwater and reactions with aquifer minerals have a profound effect on water quality and recharge these geochemical processes are responsible for the seasonal and spatial variations in groundwater chemistry as well as recharge rates rajmohan and elango 2004 ako et al 2010 the hydrochemistry of groundwater be influenced by the chemistry of water in the recharge area as well as on different geochemical processes prior to infiltration and in the subsurface li et al 2008 the quality of water in the subsurface aquifers is mainly dependent on the chemical and physical properties of surrounding rocks the quantitative and qualitative properties of through flowing water bodies and the products of human activity matthess 1982 thus spatial and temporal variability evaluation of major ions in groundwater is a widely accepted tool to provide insight not only about the aquifer s heterogeneity and connectivity but also the processes that controls the water chemistry chenini and khemiri 2009 chidambaram et al 2005 güler et al 2002 hem 1989 kamtchueng et al 2014 ledesma ruiz et al 2015 the statistical analysis helps in sorting a set of

slopes when compared to the riparian zone rz due to fertility of the soil and availability of water has resulted in the increase of agriculture practice along the mf it has become imperative to evaluate their effects on surface and groundwater quality as well as to understand the recharge process along the mf no systematic hydrogeochemical studies have been carried out to understand the geochemical process along the mf and in the rz hence this study aims to understand the variations in the geochemical process along the mf and in the rz with the aid of major ions 2 study area courtallam is located in the northwestern part of tirunelveli district tamil nadu with an area of 1789km2 and falls in between the latitude of 8 834 to 9 328 and longitude of 77 155 to 77 527 fig 1a generally courtallam is a hilly area dominated by number of hills i e 1700m above mean sea level amsl and consists of lowlands known as riparian zone below 150m amsl and mountainous areas mf from 200 to 600m amsl most residents live in the rz these cities offer various facilities for tourists such as hotels restaurants in addition to buildings and agricultural areas the mountain front areas are mainly used for agricultural purposes and pastures whereas the hills are dominated by forests courtallam has an arid to semiarid climate the mean air temperature reported by central groundwater board cgwb 2009 varies from 28 to 37 c courtallam is a hard rock terrain and the major lithological formations includes charnockite and fissile hornblende biotite gneiss fhbg a major portion of northern part of the area is underlain by charnockite whereas the southern part is underlain mainly by fhbg a few patches of sillimanite kyanite corundum mica schist tremolite also noted along the southwestern part of the study area fig 2 there are five major land use land cover patterns were observed i e agricultural land water bodies waste land forest and build up land table 4 about 60 of total area covered with agricultural lands followed by forest 17 and waste land 14 courtallam is drained by the river chittar and extends south and north of it to form a part of chittar vaippar and tamiraparani river basin fig 1b pediplains are the most prominent geomorphic feature observed along the mf few places piedmont zone structural hills and denudational hills are also found fig 1b the region receives normal average rainfall of 917 88mm year as reported by cgwb 2009 out of which 70 is contributed by northeast monsoon and rest by southwest monsoon and few summer showers ground water generally occurs under phreatic conditions in the weathered mantle and under semi confined conditions in the fissured and fractured zones at deeper levels cgwb 2009 in the study area depth to water table varies between 2 1 and 16m below ground level mbgl during pre monsoon while between 0 91 and 16 mbgl during post monsoon the water table rises during november and december attains its maximum at january and starts declining from february onwards and attains deeper level during september or october subramani 2005 a long term fluctuation is observed by cgwb 2009 for the period of 1991 2007 which shows that water level rises and falls at a range of 0 0021 1 1284m year and 0 016 0 689m year respectively there are four major types of soils observed in this area i e i deep red soil ii block cotton soil iii river alluvium deep red soil are found in sivakasi tenkasi senkottai and sankarankoil blocks and it is suitable for cultivating coconut and palmyrah trees the block cotton soil is found in tirunelveli palayankottai and sankarankoil blocks and it is suitable for cultivating paddy ragi and cholam etc the river alluvial soils occur along the river courses of tamrabarani and chittar river covering in the blocks tirunelveli and palayankottai and it is suitable for cultivating groundnut chillies and cumbu 3 materials and methods in order to establish spatial distribution samples were collected taking several factors into consideration like lithology geomorphology river influence urban agricultural activity and availability of wells since the study area is bounded by a hilly terrain covered by reserve forest it becomes practically not possible to sample in these regions hence the samples have been spatially distributed in order to have a wide coverage though certain regions were not sampled due to non availability of wells and not approachable a total of 53 samples were collected from hand pumps bore wells based on spatial variance and lithological coverage during april 2015 representing pre monsoon sampling locations are shown in the fig 2 ec ph tds and orp were measured in situ by using portable water analysis kit and the readings were cross checked in lab ph of water samples was measured by ph electrode thermo orion five star meter the ph electrode is active and stable only after wetting hence for this purpose it must be immersed for at least ten hours in 0 1m hcl or in a buffer of ph 4 to 7 before using the reference part of the electrode is topped with a 3 5m kcl solution after rinsing the electrode with distilled water it was immersed in a buffer solution of ph 6 87 25 c the cal knob was adjusted then the slope knob was attuned after immersing the electrode in a buffer solution of ph 4 01 25 c subsequently the instrument is calibrated and thus ph of each water sample was determined three readings of each sample were recorded to get accurate result the samples were stirred during measurement to promote homogeneity ec and tds was measured by the same meter the instrument was first calibrated and set for 0 01m kcl standard 1413ms cm at 25 c three readings of each sample were taken analysis of ground water samples were done in detail for different ions like hco3 cl so4 2 po4 3 no3 h4sio4 ca2 mg2 na and k ca2 mg2 cl hco3 by titration method senthilkumar and elango 2013 thilagavathi et al 2013 2014 na and k by flame photometry table 2 and so4 2 po4 3 no3 and h4sio4 by each sample was analyzed thrice and average of the analysis was considered the variation of each parameter of the same sample was less than 3 the total cation tz and total anion tz balance is considered to show ionic balance error percentage domenico and schwartz 1998 freeze and cherry 1979 the analytical precision for the measurements of cations and anions was determined by calculating the ionic balance error by using the formula given in the eq 1 that varies by about 5 10 freeze and cherry 1979 1 t z t z t z t z 100 a synoptic overview of the methodology adopted the chemicals instruments used to analyze the major ions and their detection limits are given in the following table 2 the values greater than that of the detection limit are diluted and analyzed and later multiplied with dilution factor statistical package of social sciences spss version 10 was used for correlation analyses and factor analyses wunderlin et al 2001 simeonova et al 2003a 2003b singh et al 2004 major cation and anion data obtained from the laboratory analysis were used as input data for factor analysis new groups of variables were generated from the initial data set which is linear combination of original variables an eigenvalue of 1 was taken as minimum for factor extraction harmann 1960 kaiser 1958 factor scores are calculated for each sample and are plotted in spatial diagrams spatial diagrams were drawn by using map info software professional 8 5 combined with vertical mapper in the present study wateq4f 2 63 ball nordstrom 1991 was used to derive the saturation index si of carbonate minerals logpco2 and ionic strength the standard method of the software distinguishes four forms of caco3 carbonate minerals i e calcite aragonite dolomite and magnesite the influence of other ions are accounted through the ionic strength and logpco2 si of carbonate minerals correlated with hco3 ph ionic strength and logpco2 and plotted graphically to delineate the recharge process along the foothills 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrochemistry the minimum maximum and mean concentrations of various cations and anions and their permissible limits are described in table 3 the ca2 concentration in the study area ranges from 24mgl 1 to 276mgl 1 with lowest and highest value observed at rz mg2 in the present study shows values ranging from 7 2 mgl 1 to 87mgl 1 in the groundwater samples of the study area and dominant in rz na concentration ranges from 54mgl 1 to 376 00mgl 1 which is highest at both mf and rz the higher concentration of k is observed in rz groundwater samples and generally it ranges from 0 90mgl 1 to 93 00mgl 1 in study area the concentration of bicarbonate ranges from 97 6 to 573 40mgl 1 having maximum and minimum concentration reported in both mf and rz cl ranges from 35 45mgl 1 to 1187 50mgl 1 highest concentration noted in rz and minimum value observed in mf so4 concentration varies from 0 18mgl 1 to 3 45mgl 1 and highest concentration is observed at rz no3 ranges from 43 54mgl 1 to 130 09mgl 1 which is observed to be highest in rz and minimum at mf silica concentration ranges from 30mgl 1 to 290mgl 1 with maximum level at rz and lowest also observed during at rz the electrical conductivity ec and alkalinity relationships were attempted to understand the hydrological processes occurring in groundwater fig 3 ec was correlated with alkalinity and in general there exist a positive trend linearly the regression line was established based on the data of groundwater from domestic wells throughout the courtallam as suggested by koh et al 2007b 2009 2012 most of the mf samples including rz samples group a were below the regression line and have lower ec concentration likely to be recharged from the uncontaminated source i e may be by natural process and natural mineralization predominated in its chemical composition koh et al 2009 in contrast the samples of rz plotted above the regression line indicating that the groundwater was progressively affected by contamination sources in residential and agricultural areas of down gradient regions few mf samples group b 20 21 17 46 and 47 are also falling above the regression line indicating the contamination source is from agricultural practices agricultural activities are more intensive along mf thus infiltration of anthropogenic substances agrochemicals accompanying with natural groundwater recharge process indicates a notable higher ec concentration in these locations two mf sample 5 and 19 deviate from the linearity which have high nitrate concentration 2 07meq l and 1 84meq l respectively which implies natural mineralization is predominant over the nitrate contamination koh et al 2007a the relationship between cl and no3 fig 4 in groundwater was studied to determine if groundwater quality was affected by anthropogenic sources based on the relationship between cl and no3 for groundwater it is divided into 3 groups group a b and c cl and no3 concentrations for most of the group a samples both mf and rz showed significantly moderate values 3 10meq l and 0 8 1 7meq l respectively whereas the group b plotted are the representation of rz samples shows significantly higher cl concentrations when compared to those of mf regions furthermore group c samples collected along the mf have highest no3 concentrations as compared to rz groundwater the proportion cl and no3 concentration in group a samples show contamination due residential and agricultural areas this is supported by the fact that forest and agricultural areas comprise highest 17 and 60 of the area whereas other land use patterns like waste land urban and water bodies cover 14 6 and 4 of the area respectively table 4 additionally samples 3 7 25 26 27 31 and 50 group b have highest cl concentration and fall near to the urban area of rz which substantiate the fact that unban activities are more noticeable than that of agricultural activities infiltration of aquifers by municipal and domestic sewage from urbanized area leads to preferential leaching of high soluble surface and near surface soil na cl salts which are completely dissolved during determination akiti 1980 subsequent evaporative concentration may also cause the less soluble salts to precipitate out of solution resulting in the percolating water becoming enriched with cl drever and smith 1978 furthermore the samples 1 4 5 19 and 21 group c shows notable concentration of no3 represented at mf these locations mainly influenced by agricultural activities as these samples fall in the agricultural land mf is mostly covered with agricultural land according to lambrakis et al 2004 the main source of no3 is an agricultural fertilizers thus elevated no3 in characterized with discharge of no3 rich water in to the aquifer derived from agricultural practices it is also inferred that mf samples are more influenced by no3 agricultural practice and that of rz sample by cl due to urbanization to explore the relative importance of different weathering process in this region a bivariate plot in between si mm and hco3 meq l is plotted fig 5 there is a negative co relation noted between si and hco3 for mf samples it can be divided into 3 categories the samples 12 19 41 5 and 11 have higher silica whereas the samples 18 22 15 21 17 23 20 and 46 falls in moderate silica and the samples 45 1 and 4 have lesser silica the samples with higher silica observed near to agricultural land of mf region this coupled with the overall greater concentrations of no3 in the agricultural lands may be indicative of nh4 enhanced weathering of silicates eq 2 as a result of nitrification of n fertilizers barnes and raymond 2009 2 2nh4 4o2 casio3 2no3 h2o ca2 h4sio4 2h in soils nh4 in nitrogenous fertilizer and manure yields protons h that can oxidize silicate minerals and release base cations and silicic acid h4sio4 from silicate minerals furthermore hco3 released from soil and lime weathering is titrated via h thereby releasing co2 into the atmosphere this results in losses of hco3 with respect to base cations berthelin et al 1985 gandois et al 2011 perrin et al 2008 as stated above in the study area section mf is mainly covered with forest the forested site is one of the major factor to enhance the nitrification released acids fortner et al 2012 for example leaf litter decomposition has been revealed to enhance nitrification associated silicate weathering in mature temperate forests berthelin et al 1985 the relation between nitrification and chemical weathering in forested areas possibly depends on the dominant tree cover and resulting litter decomposition due to deforestation at hubbard brook experimental watershed in new hampshire usa short term increase in the export of dissolved silica at the same time rates of increase in de nitrification conley et al 2008 likens 2004 therefore it can be stated that de nitrification processes in forested areas also enhance silicate weathering bedrock geology also plays a significant role for variation in silica concentration along mf region high silica samples fall in the charnockitic terrain however moderate and lesser silica samples observed fhbg region charnockites consists of mainly quartz and feldspars potash feldspar soda feldspar feldspars are more susceptible for weathering and alteration than quartz in silicate rocks manish et al 2009 thus weathering of soda feldspar albite and potash feldspars orthoclase and microcline may contributes silicate to groundwater thilagavathi et al 2013 furthermore there is an inverse relation exist between si and hco3 for rz samples which indicates carbonate weathering due to the release of hco3 during the process of weathering thilagavathi et al 2013 ph governs silica and most of the mf samples have ph below 7 25 hence it is interesting to note that there is an inverse relation between the si and hco3 the presence of carbonate and silicate rock in the study area can be inferred from the relative abundance of ca2 and mg2 ratio in the groundwater while weathering of carbonate and silicates may contribute ca2 and mg2 to the groundwater the dissolution of calcite and dolomite can be shown by the groundwater s ca2 mg2 molar ratio ca2 mg2 molar ratio that is equal to one indicates dissolution of dolomite rocks mayo and loucks 1995 while a greater ratio may represent a more dominant calcite contribution from the rocks a ca2 mg2 ratio greater than 2 may represent the dissolution of silicate minerals into the groundwater katz et al 1998 few rz samples have ratio in between 1 and 2 that means calcite dissolution is predominant but there are no carbonate rocks in this region and hence it can be inferred that they could have been acquired due to the ion exchange process or leaching process fig 6 few mf and rz samples also shows ratio greater than 2 which indicates dissolution of silicate minerals the dissolution of silicate minerals could be represented in the following reactions in natural systems kura et al 2013 3 kalsi3o8 1 2h2o k oh 2h4sio4 1 2al2si2o5 oh 4 4 kalsi3o8 h2co3 9 2h2o k hco3 2h4sio4 ½al2si2o5 oh 4 dissolution is a simple and common weathering reaction in carbonate rocks drever 1988 the relationship between ca2 mg2 versus hco3 so4 2 was used to identify the weathering process predominates in the study area majority of sample values clustered around and above the 1 1 line fig 7 which shows predominance of carbonate weathering most of the samples along the foothills fall well as along the equiline line which indicate predominance of silicate and carbonate weathering further it is also inferred that a few rz samples fall above the equiline and value ranges from 8 to 22 which indicates predominance of carbonate weathering thus silicate release is more predominant along mf as compared to rz the relationship between no3 cl and k cl was employed as an important proxy in determining whether groundwater quality is affected by natural or anthropogenic sources fig 8 it is stated by vengosh et al 1994 2002 k cl 0 02 corresponds to waste water infiltration in order to understand whether these samples represent the waste water infiltration an attempt was made to co relate no3 cl to that of k cl because no3 cl ratio is known to be associated with anthropogenic sources and have been widely used as indicators of anthropogenic contamination in many watersheds e g grasby et al 1997 lee et al 2008 mayer et al 2002 septic tanks cesspool salts also contributes a significant fraction of nitrogen to the groundwater u s environmental protection agency 1994 it is stated that one typical system effluent contain approximately 7mg l organic nitrogen 25mg l of ammonium nitrogen and 0 3mg l nitrate nitrogen u s environmental protection agency 1994 when septic tank leach fields dry out in summer previously absorbed ammonium can be converted to nitrate and eventually lost leaching it is inferred that there are two linear representations in this plot i e class i almost equal no3 cl and k cl ratio linearity which is mainly the influence of agricultural practices most of the fertilizers used in this region are muriate of potash mop kcl and nitrate of potash nop kno3 and ammonium nitrate nh4no3 which comprises of k and no3 and this is being influenced in the groundwater of the region furthermore class ii we have a higher ratio of k cl which indicates the addition of k into the groundwater by weathering or ion exchange rest samples which have higher cl than that of these two process is mainly because of leaching process or the dissolution of salts which are already present in the cracks and joints prasanna et al 2008 due to the precipitation in previous seasons 4 2 relationship of logpco2 and ionic strength the ionic strength of groundwater ranges from 0 005 to 0 055 the higher ionic strength reveals the longer residence time and rock water interaction with the host rock chidambaram et al 2007 or due to the dissolution of ions by natural or anthropogenic sources in the groundwater system partial pressure of carbon dioxide plays an important role in the state of saturation of carbonate minerals the log pco2 raymahashay 1986 for each samples are determined to study its relation to recharge prasanna et al 2009 chidambaram et al 2008 and it ranges from 0 91 to 2 54 fig 9 the ionic strength does not show any linearity with log pco2 and this may be due to higher ph or lesser neutralizing ions like ca raymahashay 1986 most of the mf and part of rz samples zone 1 ranges between 0 9 and 1 6 closed system indicating deep circulation of groundwater with the lesser amount of atmospheric contact which results in the leaching and interaction of country rocks of the minerals through which it flows resulting in higher ionic strength thivya et al 2015 zone 2 indicates lesser ionic strength and higher pco2 reflecting closed system with lesser groundwater interaction samples of rz zone 3 are observed around 1 8 to 2 5 which indicate that it interacts with atmosphere open system this may also indicate shallow water condition with lesser host rock interaction or ionic input most of the mf samples fall in zone 2 an increase in the logpco2 during water rock interaction impacts the process of mineral dissolution higher ph is noted in lesser log pco2 which indicates the fresh water recharge or atmosphere interaction with system most of the predominantly samples of mf and parts of rz samples are noted in lower ph and higher logpco2 indicates the closed system of groundwater it is also interesting to note that ph decreases from 8 to 6 5 with increase in log pco2 fig 10 this increase of the log pco2 shows that there is less interaction of the groundwater with atmosphere lower pco2 enhances the minerals like plagioclase which increases the ph and results in the formation of bicarbonate thus accumulates more cations in the remaining water venturelli and boschetti 2003 simultaneously higher pco2 increases the weathering which is mainly due to long residence time chidambaram et al 2011 prasanna et al 2008 with lesser influence of ph 4 3 saturation index of carbonate minerals saturation index si of carbonate minerals are mostly based on the bicarbonate concentration in water it is derived by weathering or from other source remains in the aqueous medium trying to equilibrate with different ions like ca and mg co2 out gassing from the samples would lead to a calculated increase in the saturation state with respect to all carbonate minerals excess co2 content causes the solution to be less supersaturated with respect to all the carbonate minerals chidambaram et al 2011 an increase in the logpco2 during water rock interaction influences the process of mineral dissolution si of groundwaters for carbonate minerals such as magnesite mgco3 aragonite caco3 calcite caco3 dolomite camg co3 2 were calculated and in the following order of sid sic sia sim in mf all the samples are undersaturated and few representations from near saturation to saturated state fig 11 in rz most of the samples show saturation states of calcite aragonite and in some samples of dolomite reaches saturated state and generally magnesite is undersaturated there is an increase of saturation with the increase of hco3 concentration in water logpco2 produces an increase the carbonate ion concentration and therefore drive the reaction towards saturation however increasing logpco2 with decreases ph in most of the samples of mf which decreases co3 concentration and therefore drives the reaction towards dissolution the calcite solubility increases the logpco2 concentration in groundwater the samples in undersaturation states show higher values for calcite aragonite than dolomite but those samples represented above the state of saturation reflect higher state of saturation for dolomite and aragonite this may be due to the fact that till the stage of saturation hco3 has more affinity to ca2 and later it shows more affinity to compounds with ca2 and mg2 or may be due to variations in ph after saturation which is more likely to increase the co3 content in water which tends to have affinity to ca2 and mg2 compounds it may also be due to the preferential addition of mg2 to caco3 and formation of new camg co3 2 which results in the increase of si of dolomite in the saturation state than the other carbonate minerals the saturation of magnesite requires 2 mg2 atoms to form an mgco3 compound so the first available free magnesium tends to join with existing calcite to form dolomite or it forms new dolomite 5 caco3 mg2 camg co3 2 6 ca2 mg2 2 co3 2 camg co3 2 4 4 thermodynamic stability of groundwater the thermodynamic stability of mg2 and k has been plotted fig 12 for groundwater samples in mg system mf samples fall in kaolinite field whereas in rz most of the samples fall in kaolinite field with few representations in chlorite field due to the higher concentration of mg2 in groundwater a shift of samples between two fields i e kaolinite and chlorite due to forward or reverse nature of reaction chidambaram 2007 7 chlorite 10h kaolinite 5mg2 h4sio4 5h2o in k system most of the rz samples fall in kaolinite field and some fall in k feldspar system indicating the migration of composition from the kaolinite to feldspar field the diagram shows that the stability field of clay minerals co exist in matrix phase at a constant composition of water during chemical reaction of rock and water feldspars in rocks would react with water and release dissolved silica when released it is consumed for conversion of gibbsite to kaolinite the solution composition moves to gibbsite kaolinite boundary unit all gibbsite have been used up then solution boundary moves from kaolinite to muscovite boundary until all kaolinite are used up 8 kal si3o8 h2o kal3si3o10 oh 2 k oh h4sio4 most of the mf samples fall along the boundary of kaolinite to muscovite but the rz samples show a wide a range of representation from kaolinite to k feldspar 4 5 correlation analysis 4 5 1 mountain front aquifer correlation analysis is used to determine the concentration of relationship experiential between two variables kamakshaiah and seshadri 2015 such relationship is likely lead to interpretation about relationship between the variables correlation matrix between various parameters of mf aquifer is shown in table 5 most of the parameters abide statistically significant correlation with each other representing close association of these parameters mf samples show positive correlation between ec and tds which indicates ec is a measure of dissolved solids in ground water tds has positive relationship with cl so4 2 ca2 mg2 na and k etc the major ions na ca2 mg2 correlate positively indicating a common source of dissolution probably weathering cl show positive correlation with most anions and cations liou and lo 2003 especially ca2 na and mg2 substantiates dissolution and leaching of secondary salts prasanna et al 2010a 2010b ramamohan reddy et al 2014 this trend also indicates the influence of agriculture activities subha rao et al 2012 occurrence of good correlation between ca2 and cl is also inferred significant correlation of hco3 with ca2 mg2 na and k indicates chemical weathering ramamohan reddy et al 2014 temperature correlated very positively with ph and tds and to a lesser extent ec the amount by which ec rises depends on increase in temperature yilmaz and koc 2014 water temperature affects the ec so that its value increases from 2 upto 3 per 1 c lenntech 2014 by interpretation the temperature of the groundwater impacts significantly on the ec tds and vice versa which is mainly influenced in the closed system with lesser influence of atmosphere it s evident that most of mf samples show higher values of pco2 the positive correlation is noted between so4 2 and ca2 na k and cl the strong negative correlation is also noted between sio2 with ec and ph 4 5 2 riparian zone aquifer correlation analysis in the rz aquifer showing the temperature is negatively correlated with ph which signify that if temperature will increase than ph will decrease table 6 in clean water the hydrogen ion concentration is the result of the dissociation balance bis 1991 9 h2o h oh pkw 25 c 14 0 the negative logarithm of kw reduce with increasing temperature and hence the ph will reduce ph in pure water pkw 2 the ph of pure water is 7 49 in 0 c contrast with a value of 7 0 at 25 c the hydrogen ion concentration at 0 c is only 32 of the value at 25 c there is a negative correlation between temperature and ca this might be due to reduction in the solubility of caco3 as the temperature increases kamakshaiah and seshadri 2015 the major ions ca2 mg2 na cl and hco3 were found to be correlated positively representing the origin of major cations due to dissolution precipitation processes khatiwada et al 2002 cl and na possess a very good positive correlation 0 807 between each other the high na and cl contents distinguish in rz samples could suggest the dissolution of chloride salts the dissolution of salts as result of urban influence in water will also release equal concentrations of na and cl into the solution belkhiri et al 2010 4 6 factor analysis 4 6 1 mountain front aquifer factor analysis is a multivariate statistical method provides the general relationship between the measured chemical variables by showing multivariate patterns that may help to classify the original data the factor analysis generated four significant factors which explained 76 of the variance in data sets of mf samples factor1 explanation for 42 of the variance table 7 showing positive representation with almost all variables the chemical elements of this factor ca2 na mg2 cl hco3 and so4 2 are considered to be controls the mineralization cl hco3 ca2 mg2 and na indicate leaching of secondary salts prasanna et al 2009 strong loading of ec and tds on factor 1 can be explained by dissolution of various type of salt such as nacl mgcl2 and nahco3 the negative loading of ph on factor i confirms that the concentration of ph in the groundwater does not contribute significantly to ec tds values akoteyon et al 2011 factor 2 accounts for 13 of the variance in water chemistry represented by no3 and po4 3 indicative of anthropogenic activities such as agricultural waste positive loading for no3 and po4 3 show the influence of rainfall along with agricultural wastewater on the aquifer recharge saeedeh et al 2013 po4 3 is mainly used as a fertilizer for agricultural production factor 3 accounts for 11 of the variance with strong positive loading of k and sio2 positive loading of sio2 reflects the dissolution of silicate minerals such as potash feldspar which is the chief mineral component of gneiss and charnockite enhanced by the low ph values induced by the co2 dissolution factor 4 with the strong loading of ph and temperature explained 10 of variance and temperature as it represents the closed system which is evident from the pco2 values and correlation analysis 4 6 2 riparian zone aquifer the factor analysis generated three significant factors which explained 65 5 of the variance in data sets of rz table 8 factor 1 with 40 of the variance in water with strong positive loading of ec tds ca2 mg2 na cl and so4 2 leaching of secondary salts predominate this factor factor 2 accounts for 17 of the variance with the strong loading ph hco3 and k ph of most of the water samples is greater than 7 alkalinity of water may be due carbonate and bicarbonate of k karpagam 2017 representing the predominance of k feldspar weathering in riparian groundwater showing the cationic predominance than anions was found these different patterns occurred probably due to different lithologic substratum which could result for instance in distinct nutrient inputs the concentration of these ions varied where chloride dominance was replaced by bicarbonate suggesting important weathering reactions and increased atmospheric contributions factor 3 accounts for 8 of the variance with strong positive loading of no3 and po4 3 the higher value of nutrients in this factor could have been due to surface run off from the surrounding farmlands that might have brought ionic substances such as no3 and po4 3 from fertilizer boyacioglu and boyacioglu 2008 the reduction in nitrate in groundwater flowing through the riparian zone in agricultural watersheds has been recognized to denitrification uptake by vegetation and control by microorganisms devito et al 2000 lowrance et al 1995 nelson et al 1995 4 7 spatial distribution the spatial distribution of the factor loading of mf samples and rz samples are shown in the fig 13 the leaching of the secondary salts are observed in fhbg and charnockite in the south north and western region of the study area influence of the no3 and po4 3 is predominant in the southern part of the study area indicating the influence of agriculture dominance of silicate dissolution is represented in most of samples due to large number of weaker zones along the mf banaja et al 2017 temperature factor is dominant in the massive charnockites all the four factors are dominate in the samples of vasudevanallur puliyangudi tippanampatti spatial representation rz samples shows the leaching of secondary salts it is represented in the charnockites and along the flood plain weathering is predominant in the fhbg region and along the contact of the lithologies anthropogenic factor of no3 and po4 3 is predominantly represented in the charnockite region representative samples from fhbg samples shows the combination of factor 2 and factor 3 it is also inferred that the agriculture and leaching is key process governing the water chemistry in the charnockite of the rz there are many samples with non representation of any of these factors in rz than the mf region 5 conclusion the integration of statistical approaches and geochemical methods were applied to investigate the factors and processes governing the chemical composition of groundwater in the foothills of courtallam most of the samples both mf and rz fall below the regression line of ec and alkalinity indicating the recharge from un contaminated source however higher ec for few mf samples states that recharge is from agricultural return flow both silicate and carbonate weathering significantly affect the chemical composition of groundwater silica release is more predominant along mf than that of rz the mf groundwater samples were varies from under saturated to near saturate with respect to all carbonate minerals and rz samples show saturation with respect to calcite aragonite and dolomite and under saturated with magnesite composition there is an increase of saturation with the increase of hco3 concentration in water pco2 also governs the state of saturation of minerals majority of rz samples have higher ionic strength indicating higher residence time which results in the leaching and interaction of minerals in the country rocks through which it flows whereas the mf samples shows lesser ionic strength indicating lesser residence time and foothill recharge thermodynamic silicate stability plots indicate that most of the mf samples are represented in kaolinite stability field than rz samples which represent a wide range of stability leaching weathering and anthropogenic impact agricultural influence are the major factors which control the chemical composition of both mf and rz aquifer agricultural influence is more predominant along the mf and surrounding areas are mainly covered with agricultural lands it is also inferred that through the major factors governing the geochemistry of the mf and rz zones are similar so there is significant variations in geochemical signature and ion relations acknowledgements the authors would like to thank the science engineering research board serb new delhi no sb s4 es 699 2013 for

12323,hydrochemical investigation had been carried out along the foothills of courtallam to understand the predominant processes along the mountain front mf and the riparian zone rz to unravel this process 21 number of mf samples and 32 number of rz samples were collected and analyzed for major ions using standard procedures the bivariate plot of selected parameters indicate most of the mf samples have lesser ionic strength higher partial pressure of carbon dioxide log pco2 value less ph and release more silica during weathering than that of the rz samples furthermore impact of agriculture and feldspar weathering is also noted in the mf regions and the urban sewage signatures are found in few samples of mf and rz region most of the rz samples are represented by state of saturation to super saturation with respect to carbonate minerals thermodynamically the mf samples are more stable near the kaolinite boundaries in the silicate stabilities fields the main factors governing the geochemistry of both the regions are interplay of leaching and dissolution weathering and agriculture it was also inferred that land use and lithology play a significant role in groundwater composition of the region graphical abstract fx1 keywords ion relation thermodynamics factor analysis land use pattern 1 introduction since the last century population growth and climate change have increased the need for the preventive management of groundwater knowledge of the groundwater quality and recharge quantification is a basic prerequisite for efficient groundwater resource management geochemical processes occurring within the groundwater and reactions with aquifer minerals have a profound effect on water quality and recharge these geochemical processes are responsible for the seasonal and spatial variations in groundwater chemistry as well as recharge rates rajmohan and elango 2004 ako et al 2010 the hydrochemistry of groundwater be influenced by the chemistry of water in the recharge area as well as on different geochemical processes prior to infiltration and in the subsurface li et al 2008 the quality of water in the subsurface aquifers is mainly dependent on the chemical and physical properties of surrounding rocks the quantitative and qualitative properties of through flowing water bodies and the products of human activity matthess 1982 thus spatial and temporal variability evaluation of major ions in groundwater is a widely accepted tool to provide insight not only about the aquifer s heterogeneity and connectivity but also the processes that controls the water chemistry chenini and khemiri 2009 chidambaram et al 2005 güler et al 2002 hem 1989 kamtchueng et al 2014 ledesma ruiz et al 2015 the statistical analysis helps in sorting a set of

groundwater quality chidambaram et al 2013 chidambaram 2000 helena et al 2000 lambrakis et al 2004 panagopoulos et al 2004 suk and lee 1999 srinivasamoorthy et al 2008 vengosh and keren 1996 and it is significance in substantiating sequential and spatial variations caused by natural and human factors linked to recharge there are also methods to develop evolution model by making predictions about the processes along the flow direction using thermodynamic calculations and hydrochemical modelling andrade and stigter 2011 belkhiri et al 2012 chidambaram et al 2012 merkel et al 2007 table 1 lists the various hydrogeochemical approach is to understand the groundwater recharge techniques worldwide the previous localized studies explain how to assess potential yield and sustainability of the aquifer and influences of geology hydrogeology climate and human activities on surface and groundwater chemical composition antony 2012 banaja et al 2017 balasubramanian and sastri 1994 jeyaseelan et al 2013 kumar et al 2011 public works department pwd 2002 subramani et al 2005 sidhardhan et al 2015 the mountain front mf regions are the hard rock aquifers covered with pediments and with steeper slopes when compared to the riparian zone rz due to fertility of the soil and availability of water has resulted in the increase of agriculture practice along the mf it has become imperative to evaluate their effects on surface and groundwater quality as well as to understand the recharge process along the mf no systematic hydrogeochemical studies have been carried out to understand the geochemical process along the mf and in the rz hence this study aims to understand the variations in the geochemical process along the mf and in the rz with the aid of major ions 2 study area courtallam is located in the northwestern part of tirunelveli district tamil nadu with an area of 1789km2 and falls in between the latitude of 8 834 to 9 328 and longitude of 77 155 to 77 527 fig 1a generally courtallam is a hilly area dominated by number of hills i e 1700m above mean sea level amsl and consists of lowlands known as riparian zone below 150m amsl and mountainous areas mf from 200 to 600m amsl most residents live in the rz these cities offer various facilities for tourists such as hotels restaurants in addition to buildings and agricultural areas the mountain front areas are mainly used for agricultural purposes and pastures whereas the hills are dominated by forests courtallam has an arid to semiarid climate the mean air temperature reported by central groundwater board cgwb 2009 varies from 28 to 37 c courtallam is a hard rock terrain and the major lithological formations includes charnockite and fissile hornblende biotite gneiss fhbg a major portion of northern part of the area is underlain by charnockite whereas the southern part is underlain mainly by fhbg a few patches of sillimanite kyanite corundum mica schist tremolite also noted along the southwestern part of the study area fig 2 there are five major land use land cover patterns were observed i e agricultural land water bodies waste land forest and build up land table 4 about 60 of total area covered with agricultural lands followed by forest 17 and waste land 14 courtallam is drained by the river chittar and extends south and north of it to form a part of chittar vaippar and tamiraparani river basin fig 1b pediplains are the most prominent geomorphic feature observed along the mf few places piedmont zone structural hills and denudational hills are also found fig 1b the region receives normal average rainfall of 917 88mm year as reported by cgwb 2009 out of which 70 is contributed by northeast monsoon and rest by southwest monsoon and few summer showers ground water generally occurs under phreatic conditions in the weathered mantle and under semi confined conditions in the fissured and fractured zones at deeper levels cgwb 2009 in the study area depth to water table varies between 2 1 and 16m below ground level mbgl during pre monsoon while between 0 91 and 16 mbgl during post monsoon the water table rises during november and december attains its maximum at january and starts declining from february onwards and attains deeper level during september or october subramani 2005 a long term fluctuation is observed by cgwb 2009 for the period of 1991 2007 which shows that water level rises and falls at a range of 0 0021 1 1284m year and 0 016 0 689m year respectively there are four major types of soils observed in this area i e i deep red soil ii block cotton soil iii river alluvium deep red soil are found in sivakasi tenkasi senkottai and sankarankoil blocks and it is suitable for cultivating coconut and palmyrah trees the block cotton soil is found in tirunelveli palayankottai and sankarankoil blocks and it is suitable for cultivating paddy ragi and cholam etc the river alluvial soils occur along the river courses of tamrabarani and chittar river covering in the blocks tirunelveli and palayankottai and it is suitable for cultivating groundnut chillies and cumbu 3 materials and methods in order to establish spatial distribution samples were collected taking several factors into consideration like lithology geomorphology river influence urban agricultural activity and availability of wells since the study area is bounded by a hilly terrain covered by reserve forest it becomes practically not possible to sample in these regions hence the samples have been spatially distributed in order to have a wide coverage though certain regions were not sampled due to non availability of wells and not approachable a total of 53 samples were collected from hand pumps bore wells based on spatial variance and lithological coverage during april 2015 representing pre monsoon sampling locations are shown in the fig 2 ec ph tds and orp were measured in situ by using portable water analysis kit and the readings were cross checked in lab ph of water samples was measured by ph electrode thermo orion five star meter the ph electrode is active and stable only after wetting hence for this purpose it must be immersed for at least ten hours in 0 1m hcl or in a buffer of ph 4 to 7 before using the reference part of the electrode is topped with a 3 5m kcl solution after rinsing the electrode with distilled water it was immersed in a buffer solution of ph 6 87 25 c the cal knob was adjusted then the slope knob was attuned after immersing the electrode in a buffer solution of ph 4 01 25 c subsequently the instrument is calibrated and thus ph of each water sample was determined three readings of each sample were recorded to get accurate result the samples were stirred during measurement to promote homogeneity ec and tds was measured by the same meter the instrument was first calibrated and set for 0 01m kcl standard 1413ms cm at 25 c three readings of each sample were taken analysis of ground water samples were done in detail for different ions like hco3 cl so4 2 po4 3 no3 h4sio4 ca2 mg2 na and k ca2 mg2 cl hco3 by titration method senthilkumar and elango 2013 thilagavathi et al 2013 2014 na and k by flame photometry table 2 and so4 2 po4 3 no3 and h4sio4 by each sample was analyzed thrice and average of the analysis was considered the variation of each parameter of the same sample was less than 3 the total cation tz and total anion tz balance is considered to show ionic balance error percentage domenico and schwartz 1998 freeze and cherry 1979 the analytical precision for the measurements of cations and anions was determined by calculating the ionic balance error by using the formula given in the eq 1 that varies by about 5 10 freeze and cherry 1979 1 t z t z t z t z 100 a synoptic overview of the methodology adopted the chemicals instruments used to analyze the major ions and their detection limits are given in the following table 2 the values greater than that of the detection limit are diluted and analyzed and later multiplied with dilution factor statistical package of social sciences spss version 10 was used for correlation analyses and factor analyses wunderlin et al 2001 simeonova et al 2003a 2003b singh et al 2004 major cation and anion data obtained from the laboratory analysis were used as input data for factor analysis new groups of variables were generated from the initial data set which is linear combination of original variables an eigenvalue of 1 was taken as minimum for factor extraction harmann 1960 kaiser 1958 factor scores are calculated for each sample and are plotted in spatial diagrams spatial diagrams were drawn by using map info software professional 8 5 combined with vertical mapper in the present study wateq4f 2 63 ball nordstrom 1991 was used to derive the saturation index si of carbonate minerals logpco2 and ionic strength the standard method of the software distinguishes four forms of caco3 carbonate minerals i e calcite aragonite dolomite and magnesite the influence of other ions are accounted through the ionic strength and logpco2 si of carbonate minerals correlated with hco3 ph ionic strength and logpco2 and plotted graphically to delineate the recharge process along the foothills 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrochemistry the minimum maximum and mean concentrations of various cations and anions and their permissible limits are described in table 3 the ca2 concentration in the study area ranges from 24mgl 1 to 276mgl 1 with lowest and highest value observed at rz mg2 in the present study shows values ranging from 7 2 mgl 1 to 87mgl 1 in the groundwater samples of the study area and dominant in rz na concentration ranges from 54mgl 1 to 376 00mgl 1 which is highest at both mf and rz the higher concentration of k is observed in rz groundwater samples and generally it ranges from 0 90mgl 1 to 93 00mgl 1 in study area the concentration of bicarbonate ranges from 97 6 to 573 40mgl 1 having maximum and minimum concentration reported in both mf and rz cl ranges from 35 45mgl 1 to 1187 50mgl 1 highest concentration noted in rz and minimum value observed in mf so4 concentration varies from 0 18mgl 1 to 3 45mgl 1 and highest concentration is observed at rz no3 ranges from 43 54mgl 1 to 130 09mgl 1 which is observed to be highest in rz and minimum at mf silica concentration ranges from 30mgl 1 to 290mgl 1 with maximum level at rz and lowest also observed during at rz the electrical conductivity ec and alkalinity relationships were attempted to understand the hydrological processes occurring in groundwater fig 3 ec was correlated with alkalinity and in general there exist a positive trend linearly the regression line was established based on the data of groundwater from domestic wells throughout the courtallam as suggested by koh et al 2007b 2009 2012 most of the mf samples including rz samples group a were below the regression line and have lower ec concentration likely to be recharged from the uncontaminated source i e may be by natural process and natural mineralization predominated in its chemical composition koh et al 2009 in contrast the samples of rz plotted above the regression line indicating that the groundwater was progressively affected by contamination sources in residential and agricultural areas of down gradient regions few mf samples group b 20 21 17 46 and 47 are also falling above the regression line indicating the contamination source is from agricultural practices agricultural activities are more intensive along mf thus infiltration of anthropogenic substances agrochemicals accompanying with natural groundwater recharge process indicates a notable higher ec concentration in these locations two mf sample 5 and 19 deviate from the linearity which have high nitrate concentration 2 07meq l and 1 84meq l respectively which implies natural mineralization is predominant over the nitrate contamination koh et al 2007a the relationship between cl and no3 fig 4 in groundwater was studied to determine if groundwater quality was affected by anthropogenic sources based on the relationship between cl and no3 for groundwater it is divided into 3 groups group a b and c cl and no3 concentrations for most of the group a samples both mf and rz showed significantly moderate values 3 10meq l and 0 8 1 7meq l respectively whereas the group b plotted are the representation of rz samples shows significantly higher cl concentrations when compared to those of mf regions furthermore group c samples collected along the mf have highest no3 concentrations as compared to rz groundwater the proportion cl and no3 concentration in group a samples show contamination due residential and agricultural areas this is supported by the fact that forest and agricultural areas comprise highest 17 and 60 of the area whereas other land use patterns like waste land urban and water bodies cover 14 6 and 4 of the area respectively table 4 additionally samples 3 7 25 26 27 31 and 50 group b have highest cl concentration and fall near to the urban area of rz which substantiate the fact that unban activities are more noticeable than that of agricultural activities infiltration of aquifers by municipal and domestic sewage from urbanized area leads to preferential leaching of high soluble surface and near surface soil na cl salts which are completely dissolved during determination akiti 1980 subsequent evaporative concentration may also cause the less soluble salts to precipitate out of solution resulting in the percolating water becoming enriched with cl drever and smith 1978 furthermore the samples 1 4 5 19 and 21 group c shows notable concentration of no3 represented at mf these locations mainly influenced by agricultural activities as these samples fall in the agricultural land mf is mostly covered with agricultural land according to lambrakis et al 2004 the main source of no3 is an agricultural fertilizers thus elevated no3 in characterized with discharge of no3 rich water in to the aquifer derived from agricultural practices it is also inferred that mf samples are more influenced by no3 agricultural practice and that of rz sample by cl due to urbanization to explore the relative importance of different weathering process in this region a bivariate plot in between si mm and hco3 meq l is plotted fig 5 there is a negative co relation noted between si and hco3 for mf samples it can be divided into 3 categories the samples 12 19 41 5 and 11 have higher silica whereas the samples 18 22 15 21 17 23 20 and 46 falls in moderate silica and the samples 45 1 and 4 have lesser silica the samples with higher silica observed near to agricultural land of mf region this coupled with the overall greater concentrations of no3 in the agricultural lands may be indicative of nh4 enhanced weathering of silicates eq 2 as a result of nitrification of n fertilizers barnes and raymond 2009 2 2nh4 4o2 casio3 2no3 h2o ca2 h4sio4 2h in soils nh4 in nitrogenous fertilizer and manure yields protons h that can oxidize silicate minerals and release base cations and silicic acid h4sio4 from silicate minerals furthermore hco3 released from soil and lime weathering is titrated via h thereby releasing co2 into the atmosphere this results in losses of hco3 with respect to base cations berthelin et al 1985 gandois et al 2011 perrin et al 2008 as stated above in the study area section mf is mainly covered with forest the forested site is one of the major factor to enhance the nitrification released acids fortner et al 2012 for example leaf litter decomposition has been revealed to enhance nitrification associated silicate weathering in mature temperate forests berthelin et al 1985 the relation between nitrification and chemical weathering in forested areas possibly depends on the dominant tree cover and resulting litter decomposition due to deforestation at hubbard brook experimental watershed in new hampshire usa short term increase in the export of dissolved silica at the same time rates of increase in de nitrification conley et al 2008 likens 2004 therefore it can be stated that de nitrification processes in forested areas also enhance silicate weathering bedrock geology also plays a significant role for variation in silica concentration along mf region high silica samples fall in the charnockitic terrain however moderate and lesser silica samples observed fhbg region charnockites consists of mainly quartz and feldspars potash feldspar soda feldspar feldspars are more susceptible for weathering and alteration than quartz in silicate rocks manish et al 2009 thus weathering of soda feldspar albite and potash feldspars orthoclase and microcline may contributes silicate to groundwater thilagavathi et al 2013 furthermore there is an inverse relation exist between si and hco3 for rz samples which indicates carbonate weathering due to the release of hco3 during the process of weathering thilagavathi et al 2013 ph governs silica and most of the mf samples have ph below 7 25 hence it is interesting to note that there is an inverse relation between the si and hco3 the presence of carbonate and silicate rock in the study area can be inferred from the relative abundance of ca2 and mg2 ratio in the groundwater while weathering of carbonate and silicates may contribute ca2 and mg2 to the groundwater the dissolution of calcite and dolomite can be shown by the groundwater s ca2 mg2 molar ratio ca2 mg2 molar ratio that is equal to one indicates dissolution of dolomite rocks mayo and loucks 1995 while a greater ratio may represent a more dominant calcite contribution from the rocks a ca2 mg2 ratio greater than 2 may represent the dissolution of silicate minerals into the groundwater katz et al 1998 few rz samples have ratio in between 1 and 2 that means calcite dissolution is predominant but there are no carbonate rocks in this region and hence it can be inferred that they could have been acquired due to the ion exchange process or leaching process fig 6 few mf and rz samples also shows ratio greater than 2 which indicates dissolution of silicate minerals the dissolution of silicate minerals could be represented in the following reactions in natural systems kura et al 2013 3 kalsi3o8 1 2h2o k oh 2h4sio4 1 2al2si2o5 oh 4 4 kalsi3o8 h2co3 9 2h2o k hco3 2h4sio4 ½al2si2o5 oh 4 dissolution is a simple and common weathering reaction in carbonate rocks drever 1988 the relationship between ca2 mg2 versus hco3 so4 2 was used to identify the weathering process predominates in the study area majority of sample values clustered around and above the 1 1 line fig 7 which shows predominance of carbonate weathering most of the samples along the foothills fall well as along the equiline line which indicate predominance of silicate and carbonate weathering further it is also inferred that a few rz samples fall above the equiline and value ranges from 8 to 22 which indicates predominance of carbonate weathering thus silicate release is more predominant along mf as compared to rz the relationship between no3 cl and k cl was employed as an important proxy in determining whether groundwater quality is affected by natural or anthropogenic sources fig 8 it is stated by vengosh et al 1994 2002 k cl 0 02 corresponds to waste water infiltration in order to understand whether these samples represent the waste water infiltration an attempt was made to co relate no3 cl to that of k cl because no3 cl ratio is known to be associated with anthropogenic sources and have been widely used as indicators of anthropogenic contamination in many watersheds e g grasby et al 1997 lee et al 2008 mayer et al 2002 septic tanks cesspool salts also contributes a significant fraction of nitrogen to the groundwater u s environmental protection agency 1994 it is stated that one typical system effluent contain approximately 7mg l organic nitrogen 25mg l of ammonium nitrogen and 0 3mg l nitrate nitrogen u s environmental protection agency 1994 when septic tank leach fields dry out in summer previously absorbed ammonium can be converted to nitrate and eventually lost leaching it is inferred that there are two linear representations in this plot i e class i almost equal no3 cl and k cl ratio linearity which is mainly the influence of agricultural practices most of the fertilizers used in this region are muriate of potash mop kcl and nitrate of potash nop kno3 and ammonium nitrate nh4no3 which comprises of k and no3 and this is being influenced in the groundwater of the region furthermore class ii we have a higher ratio of k cl which indicates the addition of k into the groundwater by weathering or ion exchange rest samples which have higher cl than that of these two process is mainly because of leaching process or the dissolution of salts which are already present in the cracks and joints prasanna et al 2008 due to the precipitation in previous seasons 4 2 relationship of logpco2 and ionic strength the ionic strength of groundwater ranges from 0 005 to 0 055 the higher ionic strength reveals the longer residence time and rock water interaction with the host rock chidambaram et al 2007 or due to the dissolution of ions by natural or anthropogenic sources in the groundwater system partial pressure of carbon dioxide plays an important role in the state of saturation of carbonate minerals the log pco2 raymahashay 1986 for each samples are determined to study its relation to recharge prasanna et al 2009 chidambaram et al 2008 and it ranges from 0 91 to 2 54 fig 9 the ionic strength does not show any linearity with log pco2 and this may be due to higher ph or lesser neutralizing ions like ca raymahashay 1986 most of the mf and part of rz samples zone 1 ranges between 0 9 and 1 6 closed system indicating deep circulation of groundwater with the lesser amount of atmospheric contact which results in the leaching and interaction of country rocks of the minerals through which it flows resulting in higher ionic strength thivya et al 2015 zone 2 indicates lesser ionic strength and higher pco2 reflecting closed system with lesser groundwater interaction samples of rz zone 3 are observed around 1 8 to 2 5 which indicate that it interacts with atmosphere open system this may also indicate shallow water condition with lesser host rock interaction or ionic input most of the mf samples fall in zone 2 an increase in the logpco2 during water rock interaction impacts the process of mineral dissolution higher ph is noted in lesser log pco2 which indicates the fresh water recharge or atmosphere interaction with system most of the predominantly samples of mf and parts of rz samples are noted in lower ph and higher logpco2 indicates the closed system of groundwater it is also interesting to note that ph decreases from 8 to 6 5 with increase in log pco2 fig 10 this increase of the log pco2 shows that there is less interaction of the groundwater with atmosphere lower pco2 enhances the minerals like plagioclase which increases the ph and results in the formation of bicarbonate thus accumulates more cations in the remaining water venturelli and boschetti 2003 simultaneously higher pco2 increases the weathering which is mainly due to long residence time chidambaram et al 2011 prasanna et al 2008 with lesser influence of ph 4 3 saturation index of carbonate minerals saturation index si of carbonate minerals are mostly based on the bicarbonate concentration in water it is derived by weathering or from other source remains in the aqueous medium trying to equilibrate with different ions like ca and mg co2 out gassing from the samples would lead to a calculated increase in the saturation state with respect to all carbonate minerals excess co2 content causes the solution to be less supersaturated with respect to all the carbonate minerals chidambaram et al 2011 an increase in the logpco2 during water rock interaction influences the process of mineral dissolution si of groundwaters for carbonate minerals such as magnesite mgco3 aragonite caco3 calcite caco3 dolomite camg co3 2 were calculated and in the following order of sid sic sia sim in mf all the samples are undersaturated and few representations from near saturation to saturated state fig 11 in rz most of the samples show saturation states of calcite aragonite and in some samples of dolomite reaches saturated state and generally magnesite is undersaturated there is an increase of saturation with the increase of hco3 concentration in water logpco2 produces an increase the carbonate ion concentration and therefore drive the reaction towards saturation however increasing logpco2 with decreases ph in most of the samples of mf which decreases co3 concentration and therefore drives the reaction towards dissolution the calcite solubility increases the logpco2 concentration in groundwater the samples in undersaturation states show higher values for calcite aragonite than dolomite but those samples represented above the state of saturation reflect higher state of saturation for dolomite and aragonite this may be due to the fact that till the stage of saturation hco3 has more affinity to ca2 and later it shows more affinity to compounds with ca2 and mg2 or may be due to variations in ph after saturation which is more likely to increase the co3 content in water which tends to have affinity to ca2 and mg2 compounds it may also be due to the preferential addition of mg2 to caco3 and formation of new camg co3 2 which results in the increase of si of dolomite in the saturation state than the other carbonate minerals the saturation of magnesite requires 2 mg2 atoms to form an mgco3 compound so the first available free magnesium tends to join with existing calcite to form dolomite or it forms new dolomite 5 caco3 mg2 camg co3 2 6 ca2 mg2 2 co3 2 camg co3 2 4 4 thermodynamic stability of groundwater the thermodynamic stability of mg2 and k has been plotted fig 12 for groundwater samples in mg system mf samples fall in kaolinite field whereas in rz most of the samples fall in kaolinite field with few representations in chlorite field due to the higher concentration of mg2 in groundwater a shift of samples between two fields i e kaolinite and chlorite due to forward or reverse nature of reaction chidambaram 2007 7 chlorite 10h kaolinite 5mg2 h4sio4 5h2o in k system most of the rz samples fall in kaolinite field and some fall in k feldspar system indicating the migration of composition from the kaolinite to feldspar field the diagram shows that the stability field of clay minerals co exist in matrix phase at a constant composition of water during chemical reaction of rock and water feldspars in rocks would react with water and release dissolved silica when released it is consumed for conversion of gibbsite to kaolinite the solution composition moves to gibbsite kaolinite boundary unit all gibbsite have been used up then solution boundary moves from kaolinite to muscovite boundary until all kaolinite are used up 8 kal si3o8 h2o kal3si3o10 oh 2 k oh h4sio4 most of the mf samples fall along the boundary of kaolinite to muscovite but the rz samples show a wide a range of representation from kaolinite to k feldspar 4 5 correlation analysis 4 5 1 mountain front aquifer correlation analysis is used to determine the concentration of relationship experiential between two variables kamakshaiah and seshadri 2015 such relationship is likely lead to interpretation about relationship between the variables correlation matrix between various parameters of mf aquifer is shown in table 5 most of the parameters abide statistically significant correlation with each other representing close association of these parameters mf samples show positive correlation between ec and tds which indicates ec is a measure of dissolved solids in ground water tds has positive relationship with cl so4 2 ca2 mg2 na and k etc the major ions na ca2 mg2 correlate positively indicating a common source of dissolution probably weathering cl show positive correlation with most anions and cations liou and lo 2003 especially ca2 na and mg2 substantiates dissolution and leaching of secondary salts prasanna et al 2010a 2010b ramamohan reddy et al 2014 this trend also indicates the influence of agriculture activities subha rao et al 2012 occurrence of good correlation between ca2 and cl is also inferred significant correlation of hco3 with ca2 mg2 na and k indicates chemical weathering ramamohan reddy et al 2014 temperature correlated very positively with ph and tds and to a lesser extent ec the amount by which ec rises depends on increase in temperature yilmaz and koc 2014 water temperature affects the ec so that its value increases from 2 upto 3 per 1 c lenntech 2014 by interpretation the temperature of the groundwater impacts significantly on the ec tds and vice versa which is mainly influenced in the closed system with lesser influence of atmosphere it s evident that most of mf samples show higher values of pco2 the positive correlation is noted between so4 2 and ca2 na k and cl the strong negative correlation is also noted between sio2 with ec and ph 4 5 2 riparian zone aquifer correlation analysis in the rz aquifer showing the temperature is negatively correlated with ph which signify that if temperature will increase than ph will decrease table 6 in clean water the hydrogen ion concentration is the result of the dissociation balance bis 1991 9 h2o h oh pkw 25 c 14 0 the negative logarithm of kw reduce with increasing temperature and hence the ph will reduce ph in pure water pkw 2 the ph of pure water is 7 49 in 0 c contrast with a value of 7 0 at 25 c the hydrogen ion concentration at 0 c is only 32 of the value at 25 c there is a negative correlation between temperature and ca this might be due to reduction in the solubility of caco3 as the temperature increases kamakshaiah and seshadri 2015 the major ions ca2 mg2 na cl and hco3 were found to be correlated positively representing the origin of major cations due to dissolution precipitation processes khatiwada et al 2002 cl and na possess a very good positive correlation 0 807 between each other the high na and cl contents distinguish in rz samples could suggest the dissolution of chloride salts the dissolution of salts as result of urban influence in water will also release equal concentrations of na and cl into the solution belkhiri et al 2010 4 6 factor analysis 4 6 1 mountain front aquifer factor analysis is a multivariate statistical method provides the general relationship between the measured chemical variables by showing multivariate patterns that may help to classify the original data the factor analysis generated four significant factors which explained 76 of the variance in data sets of mf samples factor1 explanation for 42 of the variance table 7 showing positive representation with almost all variables the chemical elements of this factor ca2 na mg2 cl hco3 and so4 2 are considered to be controls the mineralization cl hco3 ca2 mg2 and na indicate leaching of secondary salts prasanna et al 2009 strong loading of ec and tds on factor 1 can be explained by dissolution of various type of salt such as nacl mgcl2 and nahco3 the negative loading of ph on factor i confirms that the concentration of ph in the groundwater does not contribute significantly to ec tds values akoteyon et al 2011 factor 2 accounts for 13 of the variance in water chemistry represented by no3 and po4 3 indicative of anthropogenic activities such as agricultural waste positive loading for no3 and po4 3 show the influence of rainfall along with agricultural wastewater on the aquifer recharge saeedeh et al 2013 po4 3 is mainly used as a fertilizer for agricultural production factor 3 accounts for 11 of the variance with strong positive loading of k and sio2 positive loading of sio2 reflects the dissolution of silicate minerals such as potash feldspar which is the chief mineral component of gneiss and charnockite enhanced by the low ph values induced by the co2 dissolution factor 4 with the strong loading of ph and temperature explained 10 of variance and temperature as it represents the closed system which is evident from the pco2 values and correlation analysis 4 6 2 riparian zone aquifer the factor analysis generated three significant factors which explained 65 5 of the variance in data sets of rz table 8 factor 1 with 40 of the variance in water with strong positive loading of ec tds ca2 mg2 na cl and so4 2 leaching of secondary salts predominate this factor factor 2 accounts for 17 of the variance with the strong loading ph hco3 and k ph of most of the water samples is greater than 7 alkalinity of water may be due carbonate and bicarbonate of k karpagam 2017 representing the predominance of k feldspar weathering in riparian groundwater showing the cationic predominance than anions was found these different patterns occurred probably due to different lithologic substratum which could result for instance in distinct nutrient inputs the concentration of these ions varied where chloride dominance was replaced by bicarbonate suggesting important weathering reactions and increased atmospheric contributions factor 3 accounts for 8 of the variance with strong positive loading of no3 and po4 3 the higher value of nutrients in this factor could have been due to surface run off from the surrounding farmlands that might have brought ionic substances such as no3 and po4 3 from fertilizer boyacioglu and boyacioglu 2008 the reduction in nitrate in groundwater flowing through the riparian zone in agricultural watersheds has been recognized to denitrification uptake by vegetation and control by microorganisms devito et al 2000 lowrance et al 1995 nelson et al 1995 4 7 spatial distribution the spatial distribution of the factor loading of mf samples and rz samples are shown in the fig 13 the leaching of the secondary salts are observed in fhbg and charnockite in the south north and western region of the study area influence of the no3 and po4 3 is predominant in the southern part of the study area indicating the influence of agriculture dominance of silicate dissolution is represented in most of samples due to large number of weaker zones along the mf banaja et al 2017 temperature factor is dominant in the massive charnockites all the four factors are dominate in the samples of vasudevanallur puliyangudi tippanampatti spatial representation rz samples shows the leaching of secondary salts it is represented in the charnockites and along the flood plain weathering is predominant in the fhbg region and along the contact of the lithologies anthropogenic factor of no3 and po4 3 is predominantly represented in the charnockite region representative samples from fhbg samples shows the combination of factor 2 and factor 3 it is also inferred that the agriculture and leaching is key process governing the water chemistry in the charnockite of the rz there are many samples with non representation of any of these factors in rz than the mf region 5 conclusion the integration of statistical approaches and geochemical methods were applied to investigate the factors and processes governing the chemical composition of groundwater in the foothills of courtallam most of the samples both mf and rz fall below the regression line of ec and alkalinity indicating the recharge from un contaminated source however higher ec for few mf samples states that recharge is from agricultural return flow both silicate and carbonate weathering significantly affect the chemical composition of groundwater silica release is more predominant along mf than that of rz the mf groundwater samples were varies from under saturated to near saturate with respect to all carbonate minerals and rz samples show saturation with respect to calcite aragonite and dolomite and under saturated with magnesite composition there is an increase of saturation with the increase of hco3 concentration in water pco2 also governs the state of saturation of minerals majority of rz samples have higher ionic strength indicating higher residence time which results in the leaching and interaction of minerals in the country rocks through which it flows whereas the mf samples shows lesser ionic strength indicating lesser residence time and foothill recharge thermodynamic silicate stability plots indicate that most of the mf samples are represented in kaolinite stability field than rz samples which represent a wide range of stability leaching weathering and anthropogenic impact agricultural influence are the major factors which control the chemical composition of both mf and rz aquifer agricultural influence is more predominant along the mf and surrounding areas are mainly covered with agricultural lands it is also inferred that through the major factors governing the geochemistry of the mf and rz zones are similar so there is significant variations in geochemical signature and ion relations acknowledgements the authors would like to thank the science engineering research board serb new delhi no sb s4 es 699 2013 for

which accounts for about 75 of the total study area graphical abstract fx1 keywords groundwater potential zones remote sensing and gis vertical electrical sounding survey weighted index overlay 1 introduction generally ground water occurs in weathered or semi weathered or fractured or hard rock areas whose thickness varies from 5 to 20m verma et al 1980 moreover the occurrence and movement of groundwater in a sub watershed of a typical mine area is mainly controlled by secondary porosity caused by fracturing of the underlying rocks the surface hydrological features such as geomorphology soil land use slope drainage water bodies lineament and fractures play an important role in locating the fractured zone groundwater replenishment and assessing groundwater potential zones srivastava and bhattacharya 2006 groundwater potential zones are water bearing formations of the earth crust that acts as conduits for transmission and as reservoirs for storing water these are also called as aquifers its identification and location are based on indirect analysis of some observable terrain features such as geologic geomorphic landforms and their hydrologic characteristics michael et al 2008 most of the eastern part of india odisha is suffering from water scarcity during non monsoon seasons and need rises to delineate groundwater potential zones verma et al 1980 the samij sub basin lies within the brahmani river basin of india which is entirely covered with dense forest and iron mines area most of this study area is enclosed with big companies steel authority of india limited sail jindal steel and power limited jspl etc and they had extracted the huge amount of water for their necessities there is an urgent need to understand the status of groundwater potentiality in this mined area a fast and economical way of exploring groundwater potential zones using satellite images has been used extensively because of its ability to identify various ground features adamala et al 2016 integration of remote sensing rs and geographical information system gis for the exploration of groundwater potential zones has become a breakthrough in the field of aquifer studies which assists

using terrain features like geomorphology slope land use land cover and hydrologic characteristics in addition to personal judgment chowdhury et al 2009 murthy and mamob 2009 gupta and srivastava 2010 extraction of groundwater potential zones in mine area is a complex task because of variations in weathering and fracturing zones from place to place and systematic study should be carried out rs and gis techniques provide a synoptic view of large areas facilitating better and quicker assessment development and management of water resources with collateral information subba rao 2009 in this study an attempt was made to delineate groundwater potential zones in mine area of samij sub basin using the capabilities of rs and gis techniques along with the validation using collected field data 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area falls in samij sub basin within brahmani river basin india it lies between 21 51 00 to 21 58 00 n and 85 08 07 to 85 14 55 e over an area of 63km2 fig 1 the study area has a hilly topography with an elevation varying from 590 to 840m above mean sea level the general climatic condition of the area experiences sub tropical climate with an abundant rainfall during monsoon months the recorded mean minimum temperature ranges from 10 82 c in december to 23 84 c in may and the mean of maximum temperature ranges from 25 81 to 36 64 c most of the precipitation occurs during the south west monsoon between the months of june and september and about 80 of the total rainfall is received during the monsoon period the main sources of the water supply in the study area are samij karo and many seasonal nullahs local name for ravine 2 2 satellite data most of the thematic maps were generated from the irs liss iii satellite data acquired in the year 2013 cartosat i data of 30m resolution of the same year was used for generation of digital elevation map dem of the study area the irs p6 data of high resolution were procured from the national remote sensing center nrsc hyderabad india which was used for identifying the lineaments in the study area 2 3 preparation of thematic maps the irs p6 dataset of geo coded false colour composite having the band combination of 1 2 and 3 was acquired from national remote sensing center nrsc hyderabad india pre image processing operations like adjustment in tone shape size etc were performed on the raw image a base map of the study area was prepared from the survey of india soi toposheet of 1 2000 scale which serves the purpose of delineating basin boundary and for geo referencing the slope was obtained from the cartosat i dem and topographical map of the area geographic information system and image processing modules of arcgis esri 2011 and erdas imagine software have been used in the present study to delineate potential zones the methodology adopted for the present study is shown in fig 2 a total of six thematic layers were considered and prepared for the present study such as slope e lineament density ld drainage density dd land use lu soil s and geomorphology g on the raster gis platform all the above thematic layers were assigned an appropriate rank on a scale of 1 10 depending on groundwater movement and storage table 1 the slope thematic layer is having 6 six individual features varying in the range from 0 to 33 based on its slope classification the feature with lowest slope i e 0 2 very flat was assigned with the highest rank one 1 as there may be less runoff more infiltration and more groundwater recharge which is a good indicator for the occurrence of groundwater similarly ranks of 6 5 4 3 and 2 were provided for the slope ranges 33 very steep 15 33 steep 10 15 moderate steep 5 10 moderate flat and 2 5 flat respectively table 1 total rank for slope e thematic layer rank 21 was calculated by summing all ranks 1 2 3 4 5 6 for individual slope features in a similar way ranks were assigned to each individual feature of all thematic layers ld dd lu s and g and total rank for ld dd lu s and g was calculated as 21 21 55 3 and 10 respectively table 1 thus total rank for all 6 thematic layers was obtained as 131 which is used for calculation of percentage influence of each individual thematic layer in detecting groundwater potential zones table 1 the effect of each influencing feature may contribute to delineate the groundwater potential zones the authors followed same methodology to rank the thematic layer features as chowdary et al 2009 all the thematic layers were integrated using groundwater potential index gwpi to produce groundwater potential zones which is calculated as 1 gwpi e w e r ld w l d r dd w dd r lu w l u r s w s r g w g r totalweight where w represents the weight of a thematic layer and r rank of an individual feature gwpi is a dimensionless quantity that helps in indexing the probable groundwater potential zones of an area finally integration of all the thematic layers were done using weighted index overlay wio model in gis as it s one of the most accepted methods for assigning weights w and ranks r based on the multicriteria evaluations for decision making pratap et al 2000 javed and wani 2009 nagarajan and singh 2009 subba rao 2009 jha et al 2010 a final groundwater potential map was prepared based on the above technique 2 4 lithology the main rock types occurring in this study area consist of augen and migmatitic gneiss at lower sambalpur granite and medium grained biotite and gneiss at upper sambalpur granite according to the published geological survey of india gsi 2012 map which is used in the present study the sedimentary rock fine clay shale is shown coexisting with the low grade metamorphic rocks slate and phyllite hard rock lacks primary porosity water percolates through secondary porosity formed by fracturing and weathering rocks both the lower and upper sambalpur granites were fractured and weathered several sets of lineaments were identified in these rocks lower sambalpur granite was more weathered and fractured and thus has better groundwater prospects than upper sambalpur granite joints and cleavage were present in quartzite while fine clay shale slate and the phyllite group of rocks have some faults and bedding as reported in the geological quadrangle map number f 44 r gsi 2012 fine clay causes blockage of available pore space for movement of water the presence of dolerite and quartz vein reef is an indication of a groundwater barrier 2 5 resistivity tests geophysical methods have been successfully used in groundwater exploration there are various resistivity methods but the vertical electrical soundings ves method was used successfully for investigating groundwater in different lithological settings because of its simple operation and analysis of data was straight forward as compared to other methods zohdy et al 1974 stampolidis et al 2005 soupios et al 2007 kalisperi et al 2009 ves survey technique also provides the thickness and depth of water bearing formation lashkaripour 2003 sahu and sahoo 2006 a field survey was carried out in the year 2013 and 2014 at five locations kabita nullah j2 pillar near cowshed near pump house and near swimming pool within the study area to collect groundwater information using ves resistivity tests vertical electrical soundings using schlumberger array were carried out with maximum to half current electrode separation ab 2 at more than 100m which are highly used in groundwater exploration studies zohdy 1969 apparent resistivity at sounding stations was derived using the below eq 2 and is plotted against the corresponding half electrode spacing to look for weaker or stronger water potential zones the results obtained were analyzed and plotted in ms excel and ipi2win software bobachev 2002 which is mainly used by the geo physic researchers sultan et al 2009 singh et al 2011 apparent resistivity can be obtained as follows 2 ρ a ab 2 2 mn 2 2 mn π v i where ρ a apparent resistivity ab current electrode spacing m mn potential electrode spacing m i current amps and v potential difference volts 3 results and discussion 3 1 thematic layers different thematic layers viz slope lineament density drainage density land use soil and geomorphology of the study area were depicted from satellite information and processed in arcgis and erdas imagine software 3 1 1 slope map slope of any terrain is an indicator for the suitability for groundwater prospect and it is the principle factor in effecting infiltration of groundwater into subsurface in flat slope areas the surface runoff is slow allowing more time for the rainwater to percolate and hence more infiltration and groundwater recharge groundwater potentiality is expected to be greater in the flat and gently sloping area topographic data is a vital element in determining the water table elevations slope map was generated using the cartosat i dem data nrsc hyderabad india a greater portion of the study area has very flat terrain except that the upper part which has a hilly terrain with a steep slope varying from 50 to 60 as shown in fig 3 slope range were differentiated into 6 six individual features varying in the range from 0 to 33 the higher slope will produce more runoff with lesser infiltration and it will have a poor groundwater prospect as contrasted with the lower slope region therefore higher rank was assigned to a gentle slope and lesser rank to the higher slope as shown in table 1 3 1 2 lineament and lineament density map lineament comprised of fractures joints and faults is an indication for the subsurface structures that may control the movement and storage of groundwater fig 4 lineament density map is important to reveal the groundwater recharge flow and development nag and saha 2014 the peaks in the lineament density contour maps are the places of interest for groundwater resource development fig 5 the combination of fractures lineament with topographically low ground can also serve as the best aquifer horizon the 363 high pass directional convolution kernel filter under spatial enhancement techniques was applied to delineate the lineaments from satellite imagery irs p6 of 21 march 2013 smaller lineament features were also delineated using environment for visualizing images envi pci geomatica 2013 software lineament characteristics were mainly found along the sw se and ne se directions and very few were along the e w and the n s directions of the study area fig 4 lineaments play a very important role in recharging groundwater in the hard terrains rock and groundwater potential is very much higher near lineament zones koch and mather 1997 lineaments that are longer than 10km are likely to be important source of groundwater as are extensive networks of interconnected network of lineaments owing to their greater sub surface area many successful groundwater projects consider lineament mapping for selection of drilling sites teeuw 1995 considered only lineaments for groundwater exploration the lineament map was used for generating the lineament density map using the line density tool in arcgis polygons with higher values of lineament density will achieve greater recharge and hence a better prospect for groundwater lineament density has been divided into various intervals 0 29 59 29 6 97 66 97 67 183 5 183 6 304 8 304 9 497 2 and 497 3 754 6 as shown in fig 5 the most significant value of rank was designated to highest lineament density features 3 1 3 drainage density map drainage map of the study area is one of the practical approaches for knowing the lithological and structural control of landform evolution most of the agricultural activities in the study area depend on natural rivers wells rain fed structure minor irrigation and seasonal rivers etc the entire study area is covered by undulating hilly tract intersected by gorges and passes besides many seasonal nullahs local name for ravine there are about four perennial nullahs present in the region presently the important source of supply of water in this study area is basically known as samij nullah the study area was delineated from cartosat 1 dem data from nrsc hyderabad drainage density of the study area was calculated as the total length of streams in the sub basin area divided by total area of the drainage basin and expressed as km km2 fig 6 the drainage density was found to be 0 24km 1 drainage density values were categorized into six groups 0 73 76 73 77 173 2 173 3 272 6 272 7 372 372 1 484 3 and 484 4 817 8 a low drainage density region causes higher infiltration and it yields in better groundwater potential zones as compared to a high drainage density region murasingh 2014 high drainage density region is unfavorable for groundwater availability and low zero drainage density indicates high groundwater potential first rank was given to the low drainage density regions and the high rank to the more drainage density areas as shown in table 1 3 1 4 land use map land use information forms the basis for any developmental planning and suitability for groundwater prospects a land use thematic layer fig 7 was prepared by using a theme map downloaded from nrsc bhuvan thematic service dataset of 2011 2012 the distinguished classes are water bodies build up kharif double triple scrubland evergreen forest deciduous forest grassland current fallow and other wastelands the dominant land use class is deciduous forest area followed by scrubland different land use land cover classes were ranked based on land characteristics the water bodies are represented with rank 1 due to more potentiality for groundwater resources and a rank of 10 was assigned to build up area due to less scope of groundwater recharge the various ranks of land use classes are presented in table 1 3 1 5 soil map soil texture have a predominant effect on infiltration runoff and groundwater recharge mainly two types of soil groups as red earth and red sand are present in the study area rank was assigned to each soil type based on their groundwater expectations fig 8 the sandy soils are highly permeable lightly textured and well drained and rate of infiltration is excellent whereas the red earth soils are well to moderately well drained and possess of fine loams the moisture content of the soil is good because of its fine loamy texture and their ranks for different soil are presented in table 1 3 1 6 geomorphology map geomorphology reflects various landforms and structural features geomorphologic maps vary greatly depending on the purpose for which they are prepared i e terrain evaluation land resource mapping soil classification watershed prioritization groundwater studies etc a various number of terms are present in the geomorphic literature for describing the variety of landforms but all of them may not exercise definite control on the groundwater regime different individual features were distinguished in the study area and were portrayed beneath such as anthropogenic terrain highly dissected hills moderately dissected hills and pediment pediplain complex fig 9 anthropogenic terrain has been given the lowest rank four as it was created or caused by human activity pediment pediplain was given the highest rank one as it is the surface which consists of chiefly bare rock but may have a covering veneer of alluvium or gravel this acts as a highest groundwater recharge source in the study area highly dissected hills and valleys were provided with third rank since it s having mainly runoff as compared with the moderately dissected hills and valleys which are acting as recharge cum runoff 3 2 integration of thematic layers weighted index overlay model based on gwpi all the main six thematic layers slope e lineament density ld drainage density dd land use lu soil s and geomorphology g were assigned into one of the following groups viz excellent very good good moderate and poor gwpi is a dimensionless quantity that helps in indexing the probable groundwater potential zones in an area all the thematic layers were integrated and a final groundwater potential map was prepared by the application of weighted index overlay technique in arcgis software nag 2005 dinesh kumar et al 2007 avtar et al 2010 preeja et al 2011 moreover the final groundwater potential map was classified with suitable weight on a scale of 0 0 8 0 and table 2 provides the information on upper and lower limits of the weights considered for identifying the five types of groundwater potential zones according to the groundwater potential zone map the study area is categorized into five different zones namely poor moderate good very good and excellent and the weight range are categorized as 0 0 4 0 4 1 5 0 5 1 6 0 6 1 7 0 and 7 1 8 0 respectively finally a groundwater potential map was prepared fig 10 showing the very poor to excellent groundwater potential zones in the study area 3 3 field verification the results of remote sensing and gis analysis were subsequently crossed checked with the ground truth resistivity survey data the resistivity data were collected only within the jspl area rather than the entire study area as this method is costly time consuming and covered with dense forest it was observed that the groundwater surface showed a sudden variation in water saturation in granular soils and thus varying resistivity moreover the resistivity of groundwater ranges from 10 to 100ωm depending on the concentration of dissolved salts five vertical electrical soundings using schlumberger array were carried out and the results obtained were plotted in ms excel and a curved matching analysis was performed with standard ipi2win software for five locations kabita nullah j2 pillar near cowshed near pump house and near swimming pool as shown in fig 11 a e the results of the curved matching analysis of vertical electrical sounding ves survey with the ground truth data were depicted in table 3 all the five locations ground truth data errors were under 20 which is under acceptable avtar et al 2010 preeja et al 2011 from this analysis one can conclude that the study area has a good prospect for groundwater resource the comparison map of resistivity results that were obtained from the remote sensing analysis and ground truth data are shown in fig 12 the comparison results suggest that the area of jspl lies between moderate to good groundwater potential zones 4 conclusions the main aim of the study was to predict that the geospatial technique can provide an appropriate platform for delineation of groundwater potential zones in mine and dense forest area using weighted index overlay model the weighted index overlay method has been found very useful for mapping the groundwater potential zones in the study area to depict groundwater potential zones various thematic layers viz geomorphology slope land use lineament density drainage density and soil were generated using the information from satellite images toposheets and ground level data for samij sub basin these thematic layers and their feature classes were assigned weights and rank following the theories of gwpi and then the layers were integrated in the gis environment the integration of thematic layers using gwpi results in five groundwater potential zones excellent very good good moderate and poor above results were validated using vertical electrical sounding ves data from five locations in the study area it was found that most of the study area falls in moderate to good groundwater potential zones this study will be helpful in exploration and management of groundwater resources in mining and dense forest area it should be noted that this study should be validated on more locations with ground truth data acknowledgements the authors would like to thank the m s jindal steel and power ltd for funding this research work and also grateful

lower sambalpur granite was more weathered and fractured and thus has better groundwater prospects than upper sambalpur granite joints and cleavage were present in quartzite while fine clay shale slate and the phyllite group of rocks have some faults and bedding as reported in the geological quadrangle map number f 44 r gsi 2012 fine clay causes blockage of available pore space for movement of water the presence of dolerite and quartz vein reef is an indication of a groundwater barrier 2 5 resistivity tests geophysical methods have been successfully used in groundwater exploration there are various resistivity methods but the vertical electrical soundings ves method was used successfully for investigating groundwater in different lithological settings because of its simple operation and analysis of data was straight forward as compared to other methods zohdy et al 1974 stampolidis et al 2005 soupios et al 2007 kalisperi et al 2009 ves survey technique also provides the thickness and depth of water bearing formation lashkaripour 2003 sahu and sahoo 2006 a field survey was carried out in the year 2013 and 2014 at five locations kabita nullah j2 pillar near cowshed near pump house and near swimming pool within the study area to collect groundwater information using ves resistivity tests vertical electrical soundings using schlumberger array were carried out with maximum to half current electrode separation ab 2 at more than 100m which are highly used in groundwater exploration studies zohdy 1969 apparent resistivity at sounding stations was derived using the below eq 2 and is plotted against the corresponding half electrode spacing to look for weaker or stronger water potential zones the results obtained were analyzed and plotted in ms excel and ipi2win software bobachev 2002 which is mainly used by the geo physic researchers sultan et al 2009 singh et al 2011 apparent resistivity can be obtained as follows 2 ρ a ab 2 2 mn 2 2 mn π v i where ρ a apparent resistivity ab current electrode spacing m mn potential electrode spacing m i current amps and v potential difference volts 3 results and discussion 3 1 thematic layers different thematic layers viz slope lineament density drainage density land use soil and geomorphology of the study area were depicted from satellite information and processed in arcgis and erdas imagine software 3 1 1 slope map slope of any terrain is an indicator for the suitability for groundwater prospect and it is the principle factor in effecting infiltration of groundwater into subsurface in flat slope areas the surface runoff is slow allowing more time for the rainwater to percolate and hence more infiltration and groundwater recharge groundwater potentiality is expected to be greater in the flat and gently sloping area topographic data is a vital element in determining the water table elevations slope map was generated using the cartosat i dem data nrsc hyderabad india a greater portion of the study area has very flat terrain except that the upper part which has a hilly terrain with a steep slope varying from 50 to 60 as shown in fig 3 slope range were differentiated into 6 six individual features varying in the range from 0 to 33 the higher slope will produce more runoff with lesser infiltration and it will have a poor groundwater prospect as contrasted with the lower slope region therefore higher rank was assigned to a gentle slope and lesser rank to the higher slope as shown in table 1 3 1 2 lineament and lineament density map lineament comprised of fractures joints and faults is an indication for the subsurface structures that may control the movement and storage of groundwater fig 4 lineament density map is important to reveal the groundwater recharge flow and development nag and saha 2014 the peaks in the lineament density contour maps are the places of interest for groundwater resource development fig 5 the combination of fractures lineament with topographically low ground can also serve as the best aquifer horizon the 363 high pass directional convolution kernel filter under spatial enhancement techniques was applied to delineate the lineaments from satellite imagery irs p6 of 21 march 2013 smaller lineament features were also delineated using environment for visualizing images envi pci geomatica 2013 software lineament characteristics were mainly found along the sw se and ne se directions and very few were along the e w and the n s directions of the study area fig 4 lineaments play a very important role in recharging groundwater in the hard terrains rock and groundwater potential is very much higher near lineament zones koch and mather 1997 lineaments that are longer than 10km are likely to be important source of groundwater as are extensive networks of interconnected network of lineaments owing to their greater sub surface area many successful groundwater projects consider lineament mapping for selection of drilling sites teeuw 1995 considered only lineaments for groundwater exploration the lineament map was used for generating the lineament density map using the line density tool in arcgis polygons with higher values of lineament density will achieve greater recharge and hence a better prospect for groundwater lineament density has been divided into various intervals 0 29 59 29 6 97 66 97 67 183 5 183 6 304 8 304 9 497 2 and 497 3 754 6 as shown in fig 5 the most significant value of rank was designated to highest lineament density features 3 1 3 drainage density map drainage map of the study area is one of the practical approaches for knowing the lithological and structural control of landform evolution most of the agricultural activities in the study area depend on natural rivers wells rain fed structure minor irrigation and seasonal rivers etc the entire study area is covered by undulating hilly tract intersected by gorges and passes besides many seasonal nullahs local name for ravine there are about four perennial nullahs present in the region presently the important source of supply of water in this study area is basically known as samij nullah the study area was delineated from cartosat 1 dem data from nrsc hyderabad drainage density of the study area was calculated as the total length of streams in the sub basin area divided by total area of the drainage basin and expressed as km km2 fig 6 the drainage density was found to be 0 24km 1 drainage density values were categorized into six groups 0 73 76 73 77 173 2 173 3 272 6 272 7 372 372 1 484 3 and 484 4 817 8 a low drainage density region causes higher infiltration and it yields in better groundwater potential zones as compared to a high drainage density region murasingh 2014 high drainage density region is unfavorable for groundwater availability and low zero drainage density indicates high groundwater potential first rank was given to the low drainage density regions and the high rank to the more drainage density areas as shown in table 1 3 1 4 land use map land use information forms the basis for any developmental planning and suitability for groundwater prospects a land use thematic layer fig 7 was prepared by using a theme map downloaded from nrsc bhuvan thematic service dataset of 2011 2012 the distinguished classes are water bodies build up kharif double triple scrubland evergreen forest deciduous forest grassland current fallow and other wastelands the dominant land use class is deciduous forest area followed by scrubland different land use land cover classes were ranked based on land characteristics the water bodies are represented with rank 1 due to more potentiality for groundwater resources and a rank of 10 was assigned to build up area due to less scope of groundwater recharge the various ranks of land use classes are presented in table 1 3 1 5 soil map soil texture have a predominant effect on infiltration runoff and groundwater recharge mainly two types of soil groups as red earth and red sand are present in the study area rank was assigned to each soil type based on their groundwater expectations fig 8 the sandy soils are highly permeable lightly textured and well drained and rate of infiltration is excellent whereas the red earth soils are well to moderately well drained and possess of fine loams the moisture content of the soil is good because of its fine loamy texture and their ranks for different soil are presented in table 1 3 1 6 geomorphology map geomorphology reflects various landforms and structural features geomorphologic maps vary greatly depending on the purpose for which they are prepared i e terrain evaluation land resource mapping soil classification watershed prioritization groundwater studies etc a various number of terms are present in the geomorphic literature for describing the variety of landforms but all of them may not exercise definite control on the groundwater regime different individual features were distinguished in the study area and were portrayed beneath such as anthropogenic terrain highly dissected hills moderately dissected hills and pediment pediplain complex fig 9 anthropogenic terrain has been given the lowest rank four as it was created or caused by human activity pediment pediplain was given the highest rank one as it is the surface which consists of chiefly bare rock but may have a covering veneer of alluvium or gravel this acts as a highest groundwater recharge source in the study area highly dissected hills and valleys were provided with third rank since it s having mainly runoff as compared with the moderately dissected hills and valleys which are acting as recharge cum runoff 3 2 integration of thematic layers weighted index overlay model based on gwpi all the main six thematic layers slope e lineament density ld drainage density dd land use lu soil s and geomorphology g were assigned into one of the following groups viz excellent very good good moderate and poor gwpi is a dimensionless quantity that helps in indexing the probable groundwater potential zones in an area all the thematic layers were integrated and a final groundwater potential map was prepared by the application of weighted index overlay technique in arcgis software nag 2005 dinesh kumar et al 2007 avtar et al 2010 preeja et al 2011 moreover the final groundwater potential map was classified with suitable weight on a scale of 0 0 8 0 and table 2 provides the information on upper and lower limits of the weights considered for identifying the five types of groundwater potential zones according to the groundwater potential zone map the study area is categorized into five different zones namely poor moderate good very good and excellent and the weight range are categorized as 0 0 4 0 4 1 5 0 5 1 6 0 6 1 7 0 and 7 1 8 0 respectively finally a groundwater potential map was prepared fig 10 showing the very poor to excellent groundwater potential zones in the study area 3 3 field verification the results of remote sensing and gis analysis were subsequently crossed checked with the ground truth resistivity survey data the resistivity data were collected only within the jspl area rather than the entire study area as this method is costly time consuming and covered with dense forest it was observed that the groundwater surface showed a sudden variation in water saturation in granular soils and thus varying resistivity moreover the resistivity of groundwater ranges from 10 to 100ωm depending on the concentration of dissolved salts five vertical electrical soundings using schlumberger array were carried out and the results obtained were plotted in ms excel and a curved matching analysis was performed with standard ipi2win software for five locations kabita nullah j2 pillar near cowshed near pump house and near swimming pool as shown in fig 11 a e the results of the curved matching analysis of vertical electrical sounding ves survey with the ground truth data were depicted in table 3 all the five locations ground truth data errors were under 20 which is under acceptable avtar et al 2010 preeja et al 2011 from this analysis one can conclude that the study area has a good prospect for groundwater resource the comparison map of resistivity results that were obtained from the remote sensing analysis and ground truth data are shown in fig 12 the comparison results suggest that the area of jspl lies between moderate to good groundwater potential zones 4 conclusions the main aim of the study was to predict that the geospatial technique can provide an appropriate platform for delineation of groundwater potential zones in mine and dense forest area using weighted index overlay model the weighted index overlay method has been found very useful for mapping the groundwater potential zones in the study area to depict groundwater potential zones various thematic layers viz geomorphology slope land use lineament density drainage density and soil were generated using the information from satellite images toposheets and ground level data for samij sub basin these thematic layers and their feature classes were assigned weights and rank following the theories of gwpi and then the layers were integrated in the gis environment the integration of thematic layers using gwpi results in five groundwater potential zones excellent very good good moderate and poor above results were validated using vertical electrical sounding ves data from five locations in the study area it was found that most of the study area falls in moderate to good groundwater potential zones this study will be helpful in exploration and management of groundwater resources in mining and dense forest area it should be noted that this study should be validated on more locations with ground truth data acknowledgements the authors would like to thank the m s jindal steel and power ltd for funding this research work and also grateful
