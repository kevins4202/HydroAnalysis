6405,the transient storage model tsm is a popular solute transport model among hydrologists and ecologists for characterizing solute retention potential of small headwater streams tsm parameters are most commonly estimated in an inverse modeling framework using tracer breakthrough data a key challenge in interpreting tsm parameters is the inherent difficulty in the estimation process and relating these parameters with the physical characteristics of streams while often recognized that multiple sources of uncertainty impact transient storage modeling rigorous evaluation of tsm parameter uncertainty is rare stream flow magnitude has been identified as a key variable in characterizing stream solute transport dynamics yet no study has shown the impact of flow magnitude on tsm parameter uncertainty in this paper we study the impact of flow magnitude on tsm parameter uncertainty by using tracer data from repeated tracer studies with changing stream flow magnitudes and introduce a software tool to perform markov chain monte carlo based parameter estimation and uncertainty evaluation the software tool developed is capable of performing thousands of model runs within a few hours which is necessary for monte carlo based parameter estimation and provides a potentially attractive framework for model testing and improvement tsm parameters were found to be relatively less important during higher flows with large uncertainty bounds and clear evidence of parameter correlations the importance of tsm parameters on solute transport seemed to increase as flow decreased with seasonal baseflow recession our findings highlight the need for improved field methodologies to reduce parameter uncertainty and the need for further improvement in the model structure for successful stream characterization keywords transient storage model uncertainty flow variation markov chain monte carlo parameter estimation tracer 1 introduction 1 1 background solute transport in small headwater streams is a highly investigated subset of hydrologic research a relatively large fraction of the flow in small headwater streams traverses and interacts with the contiguous shallow subsurface known as the hyporheic zone triska et al 1989 stanford and ward 1993 and also interacts with surface dead zones formed by flow obstructing structures e g around bars behind woody debris etc harvey et al 1996 hyporheic storage zones provide an opportunity for solutes to come in contact with reactive surfaces e g sediment microbes and thus can potentially process and remove nutrients from the water column and play a role in abating nutrient concentrations in receiving water bodies gomez velez and harvey 2014 hester et al 2014 similarly surface dead zones provide opportunities for photochemical reactions such as photoreduction of dissolved ferric iron mcknight et al 2001 collectively hyporheic and surface dead zones give rise to transient storage effects on the transport of solutes in streams bencala and walters 1983 thus solute transport characteristics of small headwater streams can potentially be a good indicator of their nutrient processing capacity o connor et al 2010 tracer studies both conservative and reactive are a popular and relatively easy technique to infer aggregated reach scale solute transport properties among the several models used to simulate solute transport in headwater streams e g beer et al 1983 haggerty and reeves 2002 liao and cirpka 2011 the transient storage model tsm bencala and walters 1983 has gained traction among researchers as evidenced by its widespread application ensign and doyle 2005 gordon et al 2013 zarnetske et al 2015 the popular free and open source software implementation of the tsm known as the one dimensional solute transport with storage otis and its inverse modeling counterpart otis p runkel 1998 provide a convenient way for researchers in this field to perform solute transport prediction and tsm model parameter estimation using tracer data one of the key reasons for the popularity of the otis software is the simplicity and ease of use by the research community in terms of data collection preparation and application the field method commonly used for tsm model parameter estimation using slug or constant rate injection usually only considers solute breakthrough curve measurements to define the upstream boundary conditions initial conditions and downstream conditions unique estimation and interpretation of tsm parameters using this field method have proven to be challenging as several factors influence the tsm parameters phanikumar et al 2007 camacho and gonzález 2008 kelleher et al 2013 otis p estimates parameters using the non linear least squares estimation technique and approximates uncertainty bounds using model residual variance and parameter sensitivity through a linear approximation such approximate uncertainty estimates can be inadequate when the residuals are relatively large and or the model is highly non linear with respect to the parameters aster et al 2005 apart from the approximate uncertainty analysis with otis p very few researchers rigorously analyzed tsm parameter uncertainties scott et al 2003 and gooseff et al 2005 used the inverse modeling software bundle ucode poeter and hill 1998 as an alternative to otis p which provided additional summary statistics and highlighted the influence of different parts of the breakthrough curve on parameter indentifiability scott et al 2003 also reported significant parameter correlation indicating difficulty in unique parameter estimation even though the study by scott et al 2003 highlighted the importance of detailed uncertainty analysis adoption of ucode for the approximation of tsm parameter uncertainty remains limited multiple studies have reported that differences in inter experiment stream flow magnitude significantly alters tsm parameters and confounds comparison of tsm parameters between different stream reaches and even the same reach at different flow magnitude for example valett et al 1996 estimated tsm parameters for different reaches with different flows and found significant correlation between transient storage parameters and flow phanikumar et al 2007 performed four repeated tracer experiments with different flow magnitudes and estimated parameters in three contiguous reaches via monte carlo simulations that revealed that the dispersion parameter one of the tsm parameters could become redundant under particular flow conditions schmid et al 2010 analyzed tracer breakthrough curves from repeated tracer studies in two streams during different flow conditions and demonstrated that the estimated tsm parameters varied with flow magnitude for one stream while showing no clear relationship for the other schmid et al 2010 also performed a meta analysis of previous researches that studied repeated tracer experiments and concluded that inter experiment variations of some of the parameters of the tsm show contradictory relationships with variations in stream flow hart et al 1999 conducted 20 repeated tracer experiments in a mountain stream and found evidence of correlation of some of the tsm parameters with flow evidence pointing to the lack of correlation between flow and tsm parameters have also been reported in multiple studies such as the studies by d angelo et al 1993 jin and ward 2005 and ward et al 2013 ward et al 2018 conducted four repeated tracer experiments to show that transient storage parameters positively correlated with stream discharge while there has been a significant amount of experimental research to analyze tsm parameters from repeated tracer experiments most of the conclusions were drawn using a set of optimal parameter estimates and did not analyze the uncertainty associated with the optimal parameter sets wagner and harvey 1997 simulated 800 synthetic tracer studies by randomly sampling stream properties and tsm parameters from pre specified ranges of parameters and calculated the corresponding first order approximate parameter uncertainties for these synthetic tracer studies using the jacobian of the tsm model to develop the experimental damköhler number dai the authors proposed that well estimated parameters are more likely for experiments with dai number between 0 1 and 1 0 and thus the dai number provides a guideline for designing experiments such that uncertainty of the parameters can be minimized while wagner and harvey 1997 provided guideline for experiment design based on the assumption that the tsm perfectly describes the solute transport mechanism their work is not about parameter estimation via inverse modeling using measured experimental data parameter uncertainty should be considered during most parameter estimation procedures and would especially be useful when comparing the estimated parameters for different reaches or for repeated tracer experiments with different flows uncertainty information about the parameters also provide further insight as to the presence or lack of correlation between the parameters although the tsm approach has enjoyed widespread adoption within the research community to the best of our knowledge no practitioner has applied the model for the design of stream restoration activities which is a multibillion dollar industry in the usa bernhardt et al 2005 understanding of the tsm parameters and uncertainty and appropriate field methods for robust parameter identification are key for the consistent characterization of stream reaches and would thus be beneficial for practitioners such as the stream restoration community ward et al 2018 these studies highlight the need for the analysis of parameter uncertainty and identifiability in relation to flow variation we also believe that access to an easily implementable software tool is a key requirement for overcoming the hurdles of parameter uncertainty evaluation as indicated by scott et al 2003 and exemplified by the widespread acceptance of otis and otis p over others 1 2 uncertainty evaluation methods recently ward et al 2017 presented a monte carlo based uncertainty analysis toolbox for the tsm called otis monte carlo analysis toolbox otis mcat for matlab mathworks inc natick massachusetts based on the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue framework glue is an uncertainty estimation method developed by beven and binley 1992 that proposes when faced with aleatory and epistemic uncertainties there might be more than one set of parameters that are equally acceptable rather than a single optimum parameter set coining the term equifinality glue lumps multiple error sources and can use informal likelihood functions to generate parameter distributions by randomly sampling from prespecified ranges of parameters and using a certain model fit threshold for sifting out sets of acceptable or behavioral parameter sets beven and binley 2014 glue uncertainty estimation is highly popular in hydrology and related fields e g tekleab et al 2011 and sellami et al 2016 but also has been criticized for the subjective choices and the intentional deviation from formal likelihood functions mantovan and todini 2006 stedinger et al 2008 while glue is an attractive approach for dealing with uncertainties that are too difficult to isolate the sampling methodology in glue can be quite inefficient and can provide erroneous results when inadequate parameter ranges are selected qian et al 2003 vrugt et al 2009 alternately a classical method for parameter distribution exploration is markov chain monte carlo mcmc based on the bayesian inference theory mcmc is a powerful and widely adopted parameter estimation technique that has been utilized across different fields e g hydrology water distribution systems biology cosmology astrophysics and climatology e g knapp and cirpka 2017 qin and boccelli 2019 although both methods can sometime provide similar predictive uncertainties parameter uncertainties in glue are usually larger on the other hand beven and binley 1992 suggested that bayesian methods can be inappropriate for hydrologic applications with rife epistemic uncertainties where the strong and restrictive assumptions made in the formal methods about the nature of the modeling errors can rarely be justified the mcmc based parameter estimation method applied to the tsm can be useful due to the advantages of efficient convergence elimination of the need to specify parameter ranges and the associated chances of errors and potential model improvement analysis through a bayesian framework recently knapp and cirpka 2017 demonstrated the advantages of an advanced mcmc method that couples bayesian inference with an evolutionary algorithm for the parameter estimation of an alternate transient storage model with shape free travel time liao and cirpka 2011 to the best of our knowledge there are no studies that analyzed tsm parameter uncertainty and their coupling with stream flow with an mcmc type parameter estimation method the objective of this article is therefore to evaluate the impact of flow variation on the tsm parameter uncertainty using an mcmc based approach the tsm parameters for repeated tracer experiments at different flow conditions were estimated using a newly developed software tool that utilizes mcmc to estimate tsm parameter distributions the software is called otis mc we would like to stress that while flow may vary during a single tracer experiment intra experiment variability the focus of this work is on inter experiment flow variability 2 methods we analyzed field data from two case studies one from the literature avanzino et al 1984 and one from a fieldwork conducted earlier by rana et al 2017 we first introduce each of the case studies followed by our analysis methods 2 1 case study i the uvas creek experiment the transient storage parameters of the uvas creek avanzino et al 1984 have been thoroughly studied e g scott et al 2003 gooseff et al 2005 ward et al 2017 and we use this dataset to demonstrate the application of the mcmc based approach the uvas creek experiment consists of a constant rate nacl tracer injection in a riffle pool dominated mountain stream draining an 9 km2 forested catchment in santa clara county california usa grab samples were collected at multiple locations downstream of the injection and we use the data from 38 m as upstream boundary condition and 619 m as downstream boundary condition to estimate reach averaged parameters although we are primarily interested in analyzing the differences between the uncertainty estimates of otis p and otis mc analysis of the uvas creek reach additionally allows us to compare the results with the otis mcat analysis presented in ward et al 2017 2 2 case study ii repeated tracer experiments case study ii is based on a field study conducted by rana et al 2017 that entailed six consecutive conservative tracer injections in a second order unnamed creek field observations and usgs topological maps in the jefferson national forest blacksburg va usa long 37 20 n lat 80 21 w the creek is characterized by predominantly gravel beds with riffle pool step pool log jam structures that drains a catchment of about 1 km2 the creek flows into the james river and eventually into the chesapeake bay the stream generally has higher flows during winter that progressively decrease during the summer period and eventually become intermittent in late summer and early autumn the conservative tracer injections were carried out between may 11 and june 9 2015 during which the flow decreased from 14 to 4 l s injection rates ranged from 100 through 150 ml s were adjusted to raise the specific electrical conductivity by about 100 µs cm beyond the background conductance daily evapotranspiration also imparted variability to the flow during the experiments which manifested more prominently during low flows additional experimental detail can be found in rana et al 2017 the field study selected an 80 m section of the creek control reach of rana et al 2017 for the six tracer experiments e1 through e6 with the nacl solution injection location about 40 m upstream of the beginning of the reach to ensure complete mixing of the tracer specific electric conductance spc was used as a surrogate for nacl concentration which was measured automatically at every 5 sec intervals at the beginning of the reach and at the end of the reach using ysi pro plus multiparameter conductivity probes ysi incorporated yellow springs ohio background spc was automatically measured 20 m upstream of the injection location at every 1 min intervals using a solinst ltc meter ontario canada the background spc remained relatively constant during the experiments with a maximum change of about 2 µs cm the average of the background spc was subtracted from the breakthrough curves before parameter estimation table 1 shows the details of the six experiments and flows in the channel flow was assumed deterministic and was estimated using average plateau spc and a calibration curve developed for the injectate workshop 1990 the important assumptions made by these experiments which are typical of most transient storage studies e g ensign and doyle 2005 are 1 constant channel flow with negligible lateral inflows 2 spatially constant model parameters and 3 temporally constant model parameters the experimental dai number for the six tracer experiments are also shown in table 1 2 3 transient storage parameter estimation we characterized transport parameters using the one dimensional advection dispersion model with well mixed off channel transient storage zones bencala and walters 1983 widely known as the tsm and given as 1 c t q a c x 1 a x a d c x α c s q lin a c lin c 2 s t α a a s c s where c and s are solute concentration ml3 in the main channel and in the transient storage zone respectively t is time t a and a s are cross sectional areas l2 of the main channel and the transient storage zone respectively q is the flow rate l3t 1 d is the dispersion coefficient l2t 1 x is the distance along stream l α is the exchange rate coefficient with the transient storage zone t 1 q lin is the lateral inflow per unit length l2t 1 and c lin is the concentration of the lateral inflow ml 3 the parameters q and q lin were estimated using the average plateau concentrations of the breakthrough curves following dilution gauging techniques and c lin was assumed to be equal to the background concentration the remaining four principal parameters namely d a a s and α were estimated with otis p and otis mc for comparison the unitless damköhler number was calculated as dai α 1 a a s l u where l l is the reach length and u lt 1 is the average velocity in the stream with the boundary conditions of the model fixed with the upstream measurements the four principal tsm parameters were estimated by fitting the downstream concentration using otis p runkel 1998 otis p uses non linear least squares regression to estimate the parameters of tsm by minimizing the sum of squared errors i 1 n ε i 2 c i c i 2 where c and c are the modeled and observed concentrations at the downstream boundary respectively and n is the total number of observations assuming measurement errors are gaussian and identically distributed with zero mean and an unknown variance otis p approximates parameter covariance as 3 c o v θ s 2 j θ t j θ 1 where θ is the non linear least square estimate of the parameter vector θ d a a s α j is the function representing jacobian of the model and s 2 i 1 n ε i 2 n p is the estimate of the unknown variance of measurement errors with p being the number of parameters the accuracy of the estimated parameter covariance and confidence interval using this approximate method critically depends on the degree of non linearity of the model with respect to the parameters aster et al 2005 the same four tsm parameters were estimated using the mcmc method implemented in otis mc which samples the posterior parameter distributions for an assumed error structure e g see vrugt 2016 for example derivation of mcmc for environmental models using bayes rule the posterior probability density function pdf of the parameter vector θ d a a s α is expressed as 4 p θ y l θ y p θ where p θ y and p θ are the posterior and prior parameter distribution respectively y is the vector of observations and l θ y denotes the likelihood function assuming the model residuals for the downstream concentrations are independent and follow a gaussian distribution with zero mean and a constant variance σ 2 as is also assumed in otis p the likelihood of the parameter can be written as 5 l θ y i 1 n 1 2 π σ 2 exp ε i 2 2 σ 2 where σ represents the standard deviation of the measurement error which was assumed to be 0 3 μs cm based on measurement device performance after testing them with multiple conductivity standards the prior distribution p θ was assumed to be a uniform distribution with a lower bounds of zero to maintain non negative parameter estimates we used the metropolis hastings m h algorithm to sample from the posterior distribution eq 4 by forming a markov chain of the parameters θ k k 1 2 m where m is the chain length the m h algorithm gilks et al 1995 which we describe briefly herein is very simple to construct and performs quite well for small number of parameters as in the case of the tsm 1 if k 1 populate θ with initial guesses increment k by one 2 sample a single point of θ from the proposal distribution q θ k θ k 1 3 calculate probability of acceptance ρ min p θ k l θ k y q θ k 1 θ k p θ k 1 l θ k 1 y q θ k θ k 1 1 4 sample u a uniform random variable from 0 1 5 if ρ u accept θ k as a new sample else reject and set θ k θ k 1 6 repeat steps 1 through 6 until k m to adequately represent the distribution of θ a certain portion of the mcmc chain is excised from the head of the chain called the burn in period such that the chain is free from the influence of the initial guesses a gaussian proposal distribution centered around θ k 1 was used for the k th sample θ k n θ k 1 δ where δ is a vector of user defined values that controls the magnitude of the proposed move the value of δ influences the jumping distance and thus controls the overall rate of acceptance i e step 5 of the candidate parameters which is an indicator of efficiency of posterior sampling the ideal acceptance rate varies with the number of parameters and the shape of the posterior but an acceptance rate of 23 44 has been shown to be optimal for the m h algorithm for small problems rosenthal 2011 irrespective of the choice of the proposal distribution q the stationary distribution of the posterior has been shown to converge to the actual posterior distribution asymptotically as m gets large rosenthal 2011 histograms of the parameter chains approximate the parameter distribution as m and estimating parameter uncertainty from the generated histograms is straightforward the 2 5 and 97 5 percentiles give a good representation of the 95 confidence region of the parameters however we should note that technically this is not equivalent to a 95 confidence interval from a frequentist point of view but more akin to a 95 credible interval from a bayesian point of view similarly the prediction interval of the modeled concentrations at the downstream end of the reach were estimated as the 95 percentile of modeled concentration at regular time intervals resulting from the accepted parameter sets excluding burn in for both case studies we selected m 20 000 and a burn in of 30 2 4 setting up and running otis mc otis mc was developed in the c programming language wrapped around the original otis code runkel 1998 written in fortran 77 since they can be easily compiled together e g using a gnu gfortran compiler to ensure user friendliness the goal was to incorporate as little change as possible to the work flow from the original otis otis p setup fig s1 supplementary information shows an example of the configuration of otis mc convergence of the parameter estimates were examined by calculating running mean and standard deviations of the chains excluding burn in which should asymptotically converge to a constant value 3 results 3 1 benchmark application and computation speed the analysis of uvas creek data served as a demonstrative application for otis mc since we could compare the results with the analysis in ward et al 2017 in fig 1 parameter distributions and correlation plots for the uvas creek data are shown below the diagonal and the 95 percentile of the modeled prediction of the breakthrough curves along with the 95 percentile of the residuals are shown in the subplot above the diagonal the correlation coefficients r of the scatter plots are shown on top of the scatter plots with the dotted line showing the linear regression line the median of the parameter distribution with otis mc agrees well with the best fit parameters estimated with otis mcat that are reported in ward et al 2017 table 2 shows the mean of the parameter values and their 95 confidence intervals estimated with otis p otis mcat and otis mc despite the wide ranges in the estimated parameters by the different methods the 95 percentile band of the breakthrough curves using otis mc are relatively narrow with a maximum band width of about 1 5 mg l fig 1 the 95 percentile of the modeled breakthrough curves resembles closely the band of breakthrough curves for the top 1 of the behavioral parameter sets presented in fig 3 of ward et al 2017 which also has a maximum band width of about 1 5 mg l indicating similar predictive capacity of the mcmc and the glue based methodology in terms of computational efficiency the evaluation of 20 000 parameter sets required approximately an hour for the uvas creek data on a dell e6530 laptop 2 7 ghz and 12 gb ram which is about 20 times faster than a similar otis mcat run on the same machine the reason for the higher computation efficiency is because otis mc has been developed as a c wrapper on top of the original otis code written in fortran and as a result the execution time for a single otis mc run is almost as fast as the original otis software additionally the limits on the number of data points for upstream and downstream boundary conditions have been increased from 200 to 20 000 in otis mc 3 2 parameter uncertainty with stream flow in the second case study we analyzed conservative tracer data from six tracer experiments with monotonically decreasing flows due to seasonal baseflow recession except for e5 where rain occurred the day before the dai numbers for the six tracer experiments table 1 are within 0 1 1 0 which is considered ideal for reliable parameter estimation wagner and harvey 1997 with a mean of 0 64 and a standard deviation of 0 17 the dai numbers indicate that similar levels of uncertainty could be expected in the parameters for the six experiments different duration of tracer injections was necessary to ensure that steady state condition was achieved steady state condition is indicated by the leveling of tracer concentration at the measurement location which is also called the tracer plateau condition during low flow conditions a true plateau condition may not be achievable due to diurnal evapotranspiration cycle which is more significant during low flows compared to during high flows for the low flow experiments e4 and e6 it was hard to ascertain steady state condition as concentration kept rising gradually after the initial rapid rise most likely due to evapotranspiration and injection was stopped after a certain duration of injection ideally for a fair comparison of the uncertainty estimates from otis p with uncertainty estimates from otis mc the measurement error variance used in eqs 3 and 5 i e s 2 and σ 2 for each experiment should be same for each experiment otis p estimated s with the optimal parameter estimates from non linear least squares method and ranged 0 4 2 2 and for otis mc we fixed σ 0 3 for all six experiments the smaller value of σ relative to s will result in a more conservative uncertainty estimates from the mcmc method fig 2 shows the parameter uncertainty bounds from otis mc 95 percentile plotted against flow with 95 ci from otis p overlaid on top while the median from otis mc closely resembled optimal otis p estimates the uncertainty estimates of the parameters from otis p were found to be much smaller compared to the percentile bands formed using otis mc even though a more conservative σ was used the growth of uncertainty with increasing flow for each parameter was assessed by comparing the growth of the coefficient of variation cv of the parameters which is the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean of the parameter estimates shown in fig 3 for all parameters cv increased with flow but the increase in cv was the least for a and highest for α with d a close second the uncertainty of parameter estimates from otis mc especially for d and α abruptly increased for flow above 7 l s with the width of the 95 percentile band increasing from the lowest flow to the highest flow experiment by about 5 and 8 times for d and α respectively the growth of cv i e growth in uncertainty of a s was intermediate compared to that of a and α parameter distributions and correlations for the highest flow experiment e1 similar to fig 1 for uvas creek are shown in fig 4 and similar figures for the rest of the experiments are shown in chronological order i e experiment e2 through e6 in figs s2 s6 of the supplementary information strong parameter interactions between a and rest of the parameters were observed the parameters a d and α were strongly correlated while correlations between d a s and α were relatively mild across all experiments d was positively correlated with a as indicated by the positive correlation coefficients on the other hand α was negatively correlated with a as indicated by the negative correlation coefficients on the scatter plots d and α also showed consistent negative correlations for experiment e1 through e6 as q decreased through the experiments the correlation structure appeared to change and the tsm parameters became better resolved with narrower distributions fig 5 shows the observed breakthrough curves at the downstream end of the reach along with the median and 95 percentile range of the modeled concentrations the median of the error residuals are also shown along with the 95 percentile range error residuals and the percentiles were relatively higher near the rising and falling limbs of the breakthrough curves biases in errors became prominent for the two lowest flow experiments e4 and e6 where the plateaus of the breakthrough curves were upward sloping indicating gradual reduction of flow during the courses of the experiments such reduction in flow usually becomes noticeable when stream flow is relatively low and foliage is high such that the diurnal effect of evapotranspiration which peaks during maximum sunshine and is least at night becomes prominent loheide 2008 we note that for the analysis of each of the experiments a constant flow was assumed and such intra experiment flow variability is a source of error as we discuss in the next section 4 discussion the mcmc parameter estimation approach highlighted the limitations of the first order approximate uncertainty estimation method adopted in otis p for the estimation of the tsm parameter uncertainty while the optimal parameter estimates using both methods were reasonably close the comparison between parameter uncertainties estimated using otis mc and approximation from the non linear least squares method otis p showed that the non linear least squares estimates largely underestimated the tsm parameter uncertainty and place undue confidence in the estimated parameters fig 2 also seen by ward et al 2017 the disparity in the estimated uncertainty by otis p and otis mc is indicative of the high degree of non linearity of the tsm the otis p software tool is comparatively much faster and does provide reliable optimal parameter estimates and therefore using otis p in conjunction with otis mc will provide greater insight about the tsm parameters of different streams the presence of such broad uncertainties in the parameters raises important questions such as can the tsm parameters be used to represent physically measurable features of streams or are the parameters much more abstract and integrate the myriad complexity inherent in solute transport mechanism to achieve certain degrees of fit to the measurements zaramella et al 2003 o connor et al 2010 boano et al 2014 zaramella et al 2016 wlostowski et al 2017 correlation of tsm parameter uncertainty with flow thus adds an extra layer of complexity in the interpretation of the solute transport characteristics of a stream the large uncertainty bounds may also increase the difficulty of the assessment of solute processing capacity of stream restoration activities such as artificial weirs and cross vanes unfortunately we cannot make any conclusion about the physics of the correlation between tsm parameter uncertainty and flow just using tracer data alone hence in the following we try to explain the trend in uncertainties in tsm parameters for the stream studied in rana et al 2017 in light of observations made in previous literature 4 1 inter experiment variability for the six tracer experiments the inter experiment trends of the uncertainties of the tsm parameters show that in general the tsm parameters became less important high variance for solute transport prediction for higher flows indicating that solute transport became more advection dispersion dominated and the impact of transient storage waned possible reduction of a s during higher flows fig 2 and also seen by zarnetske et al 2007 may have reduced the relative importance of transient storage area in our creek which may have caused d and α to act on a similar timescale on the breakthrough curve making it harder to separate the impact of the two parameters hence the broader uncertainty as the size of a s increased with decreasing q d and α became more distinguishable in terms of their impact on the breakthrough curves ward et al 2018 conducted four repeated tracer experiments in two reaches and in contrast to our study reported coefficient of variation of a s and α decreasing with flow parameter uncertainties were estimated with otis mcat but increasing for d and a the increasing uncertainty of the parameters seen in our study could also be due to the limited window of detection of the tracer method briggs et al 2009 and as such the different advective timescales during different flow conditions may have given rise to the differences in the parameter uncertainties at different flows even if the underlying transient storage processes remained very similar thus the varying window of detection adds yet another layer of complexity in the evaluation of the tsm parameters the experimental dai number close to 1 0 is considered to be a good indicator of comparable advective and exchange timescales and conducive to parameter estimates with low uncertainty wagner and harvey 1997 showed that the coefficient of variations of a s and α can be expected to be less than 0 1 for experiments with dai number between 0 1 and 1 the dai number for the six experiments calculated using the optimal parameter estimates from otis p i e ignoring the uncertainties in the parameters ranges 0 43 0 84 yet not surprisingly the uncertainties in the estimated parameters were high with coefficient of variation greater than 0 1 for most experiments fig 3 only the stream cross sectional area a was estimated with relatively low coefficient of variation less than 0 1 therefore the dai number calculated with the optimal parameter estimates may not completely explain parameter uncertainties rising from the limited window of detection of the tracer method 4 2 intra experiment variability the intra experiment interactions of a with d and α seen in fig 4 and in figs s2 through s5 supplementary information points to the fact that the parameters d and α can have indistinguishable impact on the tracer breakthrough curve that has also been documented in the literature e g kelleher et al 2013 zaramella et al 2016 since we assumed a constant q during each experiment estimated using average plateau concentrations strong correlation of the parameters with a was tantamount to strong correlation with the inverse of average stream velocity v q a therefore the positive intra experiment correlation between a and d is most likely due to the compensation of loss of advective transport at higher a by the dispersion mechanism on the other hand α was negatively correlated with a for all six experiments and also for the uvas creek experiment therefore the structure of the tsm is such that increasing α has similar effect on the modeled breakthrough curves as decreasing a or increasing v the intra experiment parameter correlations add to the difficulty in isolating the individual effects of the parameters and therefore attempts should be taken to constrain easily measurable parameters using physical measurements in the field as also suggested by neilson et al 2010 schmadel et al 2016 which should reduce uncertainties and improve identifiability of the rest of the tsm parameters examples of relatively easily measurable parameters include a via cross sectional surveys at different sections along the reach independent v measurements using velocity meters and measurement of surface transient storage using acoustic doppler current profilers as performed by phanikumar et al 2007 in depth exploration of field methods to reduce parameter uncertainty via direct measurement of parameters can potentially provide important improvements to transient storage modeling intra experiment flow changes are often assumed negligible as was done here but significant flow change is possible due to evapotranspiration causing temporal variations and lateral inflows and outflows causing spatial variations and are important sources of aleatory uncertainty ward et al 2013 yet tsm parameters for the two lowest flow experiments e4 and e6 figs s3 and s5 supplementary information where we suspect flow varied both temporally and spatially apparently do not exhibit uncertainty bounds drastically different from the other experiments e g e3 and e5 although how the intra experiment variation in q would manifest in the parameter uncertainties is unclear the systematic bias in the error residuals gives us an indication of the violation of our constant q assumption independent flow q measurements at different times of tracer injection would allow the use of variable q in the tsm and may improve tsm parameter estimation 4 3 breakthrough curves and model structure for all experiments large error residuals were observed near the rising and falling limb of the breakthrough curves most dynamic portion of the curves the rising and falling limbs of breakthrough curves thus play a major role in guiding the posterior parameter inference wagener et al 2002 scott et al 2003 wlostowski et al 2017 since the rising and the falling limbs contain a relatively small number of data points compared to the total number of data points their impact will be somewhat reduced and could be increased by using weights for example zaramella et al 2016 proposed splitting the breakthrough curve to calibrate of a and d separately from the transient storage parameters using unique breakthrough curve segments the structure of the tsm itself might be improved to address the aforementioned issues as also pointed out by haggerty et al 2000 briggs et al 2009 our study reveals that while attempts must be taken to reduce the uncertainties of the tsm parameters reporting of detailed uncertainty descriptions of the tsm parameters is extremely important as also suggested by kelleher et al 2013 ward et al 2017 which is sparingly practiced in the literature lastly computational speed is a large barrier to running monte carlo type parameter estimation relatively fast parameter estimation will not only motivate user adoption but may also encourage further improvement of models otis mc being computationally efficient is intended to lower the barrier of using monte carlo based parameter estimation 5 conclusion the parameters of the transient storage model are usually of primary interest as opposed to concentration predictions at different locations and times in different disciplines including hydrology ecology and biogeochemistry we show how the mcmc method can be utilized to generate tsm parameter distributions using a bayesian inference procedure that ensures efficient sampling of the parameter space and generates posterior parameter distribution with minimal subjective choices developed within the original otis code with the c programming language otis mc performs thousands of model runs within hours on a regular personal computer without the need for any proprietary software the code is made available for further modification and extension at https github com sm rana benchmark application of otis mc with the uvas creek dataset demonstrated the efficiency of otis mc and the results were comparable with otis mcat toolbox presented in ward et al 2017 application of otis mc on a single reach in a series of six experiments with different flows demonstrated that flow significantly controlled the tsm parameters parameter uncertainty was higher during high flows even though the dai numbers for the six experiments indicated to similar levels of reliability for the estimated parameters correlation between parameters were seen during all six experiments pointing to the difficulty in parameter isolation the mcmc based uncertainty estimates were much larger than the approximate uncertainty estimates provided by the non linear least squares method implemented within otis p our analysis of tsm parameter uncertainty demonstrated methodological difficulty as also indicated by several studies before in terms of estimating all four tsm parameters without using external measurements to constrain some of the parameters a calibrated tsm can provide solute transport predictions that match the observed data well but relating the tsm parameters to the physical properties of streams and similarly predicting tsm parameters using physical stream characteristics remains difficult if not impossible a combination of external measurements and modification advancement to the transport model might be necessary to understand the underlying processes that impact solute transport as such future tracer studies should include adequate external measurements to constrain tsm parameters and provide adequate descriptions of parameter uncertainties such that proper assessment of the stream

6405,the transient storage model tsm is a popular solute transport model among hydrologists and ecologists for characterizing solute retention potential of small headwater streams tsm parameters are most commonly estimated in an inverse modeling framework using tracer breakthrough data a key challenge in interpreting tsm parameters is the inherent difficulty in the estimation process and relating these parameters with the physical characteristics of streams while often recognized that multiple sources of uncertainty impact transient storage modeling rigorous evaluation of tsm parameter uncertainty is rare stream flow magnitude has been identified as a key variable in characterizing stream solute transport dynamics yet no study has shown the impact of flow magnitude on tsm parameter uncertainty in this paper we study the impact of flow magnitude on tsm parameter uncertainty by using tracer data from repeated tracer studies with changing stream flow magnitudes and introduce a software tool to perform markov chain monte carlo based parameter estimation and uncertainty evaluation the software tool developed is capable of performing thousands of model runs within a few hours which is necessary for monte carlo based parameter estimation and provides a potentially attractive framework for model testing and improvement tsm parameters were found to be relatively less important during higher flows with large uncertainty bounds and clear evidence of parameter correlations the importance of tsm parameters on solute transport seemed to increase as flow decreased with seasonal baseflow recession our findings highlight the need for improved field methodologies to reduce parameter uncertainty and the need for further improvement in the model structure for successful stream characterization keywords transient storage model uncertainty flow variation markov chain monte carlo parameter estimation tracer 1 introduction 1 1 background solute transport in small headwater streams is a highly investigated subset of hydrologic research a relatively large fraction of the flow in small headwater streams traverses and interacts with the contiguous shallow subsurface known as the hyporheic zone triska et al 1989 stanford and ward 1993 and also interacts with surface dead zones formed by flow obstructing structures e g around bars behind woody debris etc harvey et al 1996 hyporheic storage zones provide an opportunity for solutes to come in contact with reactive surfaces e g sediment microbes and thus can potentially process and remove nutrients from the water column and play a role in abating nutrient concentrations in receiving water bodies gomez velez and harvey 2014 hester et al 2014 similarly surface dead zones provide opportunities for photochemical reactions such as photoreduction of dissolved ferric iron mcknight et al 2001 collectively hyporheic and surface dead zones give rise to transient storage effects on the transport of solutes in streams bencala and walters 1983 thus solute transport characteristics of small headwater streams can potentially be a good indicator of their nutrient processing capacity o connor et al 2010 tracer studies both conservative and reactive are a popular and relatively easy technique to infer aggregated reach scale solute transport properties among the several models used to simulate solute transport in headwater streams e g beer et al 1983 haggerty and reeves 2002 liao and cirpka 2011 the transient storage model tsm bencala and walters 1983 has gained traction among researchers as evidenced by its widespread application ensign and doyle 2005 gordon et al 2013 zarnetske et al 2015 the popular free and open source software implementation of the tsm known as the one dimensional solute transport with storage otis and its inverse modeling counterpart otis p runkel 1998 provide a convenient way for researchers in this field to perform solute transport prediction and tsm model parameter estimation using tracer data one of the key reasons for the popularity of the otis software is the simplicity and ease of use by the research community in terms of data collection preparation and application the field method commonly used for tsm model parameter estimation using slug or constant rate injection usually only considers solute breakthrough curve measurements to define the upstream boundary conditions initial conditions and downstream conditions unique estimation and interpretation of tsm parameters using this field method have proven to be challenging as several factors influence the tsm parameters phanikumar et al 2007 camacho and gonzález 2008 kelleher et al 2013 otis p estimates parameters using the non linear least squares estimation technique and approximates uncertainty bounds using model residual variance and parameter sensitivity through a linear approximation such approximate uncertainty estimates can be inadequate when the residuals are relatively large and or the model is highly non linear with respect to the parameters aster et al 2005 apart from the approximate uncertainty analysis with otis p very few researchers rigorously analyzed tsm parameter uncertainties scott et al 2003 and gooseff et al 2005 used the inverse modeling software bundle ucode poeter and hill 1998 as an alternative to otis p which provided additional summary statistics and highlighted the influence of different parts of the breakthrough curve on parameter indentifiability scott et al 2003 also reported significant parameter correlation indicating difficulty in unique parameter estimation even though the study by scott et al 2003 highlighted the importance of detailed uncertainty analysis adoption of ucode for the approximation of tsm parameter uncertainty remains limited multiple studies have reported that differences in inter experiment stream flow magnitude significantly alters tsm parameters and confounds comparison of tsm parameters between different stream reaches and even the same reach at different flow magnitude for example valett et al 1996 estimated tsm parameters for different reaches with different flows and found significant correlation between transient storage parameters and flow phanikumar et al 2007 performed four repeated tracer experiments with different flow magnitudes and estimated parameters in three contiguous reaches via monte carlo simulations that revealed that the dispersion parameter one of the tsm parameters could become redundant under particular flow conditions schmid et al 2010 analyzed tracer breakthrough curves from repeated tracer studies in two streams during different flow conditions and demonstrated that the estimated tsm parameters varied with flow magnitude for one stream while showing no clear relationship for the other schmid et al 2010 also performed a meta analysis of previous researches that studied repeated tracer experiments and concluded that inter experiment variations of some of the parameters of the tsm show contradictory relationships with variations in stream flow hart et al 1999 conducted 20 repeated tracer experiments in a mountain stream and found evidence of correlation of some of the tsm parameters with flow evidence pointing to the lack of correlation between flow and tsm parameters have also been reported in multiple studies such as the studies by d angelo et al 1993 jin and ward 2005 and ward et al 2013 ward et al 2018 conducted four repeated tracer experiments to show that transient storage parameters positively correlated with stream discharge while there has been a significant amount of experimental research to analyze tsm parameters from repeated tracer experiments most of the conclusions were drawn using a set of optimal parameter estimates and did not analyze the uncertainty associated with the optimal parameter sets wagner and harvey 1997 simulated 800 synthetic tracer studies by randomly sampling stream properties and tsm parameters from pre specified ranges of parameters and calculated the corresponding first order approximate parameter uncertainties for these synthetic tracer studies using the jacobian of the tsm model to develop the experimental damköhler number dai the authors proposed that well estimated parameters are more likely for experiments with dai number between 0 1 and 1 0 and thus the dai number provides a guideline for designing experiments such that uncertainty of the parameters can be minimized while wagner and harvey 1997 provided guideline for experiment design based on the assumption that the tsm perfectly describes the solute transport mechanism their work is not about parameter estimation via inverse modeling using measured experimental data parameter uncertainty should be considered during most parameter estimation procedures and would especially be useful when comparing the estimated parameters for different reaches or for repeated tracer experiments with different flows uncertainty information about the parameters also provide further insight as to the presence or lack of correlation between the parameters although the tsm approach has enjoyed widespread adoption within the research community to the best of our knowledge no practitioner has applied the model for the design of stream restoration activities which is a multibillion dollar industry in the usa bernhardt et al 2005 understanding of the tsm parameters and uncertainty and appropriate field methods for robust parameter identification are key for the consistent characterization of stream reaches and would thus be beneficial for practitioners such as the stream restoration community ward et al 2018 these studies highlight the need for the analysis of parameter uncertainty and identifiability in relation to flow variation we also believe that access to an easily implementable software tool is a key requirement for overcoming the hurdles of parameter uncertainty evaluation as indicated by scott et al 2003 and exemplified by the widespread acceptance of otis and otis p over others 1 2 uncertainty evaluation methods recently ward et al 2017 presented a monte carlo based uncertainty analysis toolbox for the tsm called otis monte carlo analysis toolbox otis mcat for matlab mathworks inc natick massachusetts based on the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue framework glue is an uncertainty estimation method developed by beven and binley 1992 that proposes when faced with aleatory and epistemic uncertainties there might be more than one set of parameters that are equally acceptable rather than a single optimum parameter set coining the term equifinality glue lumps multiple error sources and can use informal likelihood functions to generate parameter distributions by randomly sampling from prespecified ranges of parameters and using a certain model fit threshold for sifting out sets of acceptable or behavioral parameter sets beven and binley 2014 glue uncertainty estimation is highly popular in hydrology and related fields e g tekleab et al 2011 and sellami et al 2016 but also has been criticized for the subjective choices and the intentional deviation from formal likelihood functions mantovan and todini 2006 stedinger et al 2008 while glue is an attractive approach for dealing with uncertainties that are too difficult to isolate the sampling methodology in glue can be quite inefficient and can provide erroneous results when inadequate parameter ranges are selected qian et al 2003 vrugt et al 2009 alternately a classical method for parameter distribution exploration is markov chain monte carlo mcmc based on the bayesian inference theory mcmc is a powerful and widely adopted parameter estimation technique that has been utilized across different fields e g hydrology water distribution systems biology cosmology astrophysics and climatology e g knapp and cirpka 2017 qin and boccelli 2019 although both methods can sometime provide similar predictive uncertainties parameter uncertainties in glue are usually larger on the other hand beven and binley 1992 suggested that bayesian methods can be inappropriate for hydrologic applications with rife epistemic uncertainties where the strong and restrictive assumptions made in the formal methods about the nature of the modeling errors can rarely be justified the mcmc based parameter estimation method applied to the tsm can be useful due to the advantages of efficient convergence elimination of the need to specify parameter ranges and the associated chances of errors and potential model improvement analysis through a bayesian framework recently knapp and cirpka 2017 demonstrated the advantages of an advanced mcmc method that couples bayesian inference with an evolutionary algorithm for the parameter estimation of an alternate transient storage model with shape free travel time liao and cirpka 2011 to the best of our knowledge there are no studies that analyzed tsm parameter uncertainty and their coupling with stream flow with an mcmc type parameter estimation method the objective of this article is therefore to evaluate the impact of flow variation on the tsm parameter uncertainty using an mcmc based approach the tsm parameters for repeated tracer experiments at different flow conditions were estimated using a newly developed software tool that utilizes mcmc to estimate tsm parameter distributions the software is called otis mc we would like to stress that while flow may vary during a single tracer experiment intra experiment variability the focus of this work is on inter experiment flow variability 2 methods we analyzed field data from two case studies one from the literature avanzino et al 1984 and one from a fieldwork conducted earlier by rana et al 2017 we first introduce each of the case studies followed by our analysis methods 2 1 case study i the uvas creek experiment the transient storage parameters of the uvas creek avanzino et al 1984 have been thoroughly studied e g scott et al 2003 gooseff et al 2005 ward et al 2017 and we use this dataset to demonstrate the application of the mcmc based approach the uvas creek experiment consists of a constant rate nacl tracer injection in a riffle pool dominated mountain stream draining an 9 km2 forested catchment in santa clara county california usa grab samples were collected at multiple locations downstream of the injection and we use the data from 38 m as upstream boundary condition and 619 m as downstream boundary condition to estimate reach averaged parameters although we are primarily interested in analyzing the differences between the uncertainty estimates of otis p and otis mc analysis of the uvas creek reach additionally allows us to compare the results with the otis mcat analysis presented in ward et al 2017 2 2 case study ii repeated tracer experiments case study ii is based on a field study conducted by rana et al 2017 that entailed six consecutive conservative tracer injections in a second order unnamed creek field observations and usgs topological maps in the jefferson national forest blacksburg va usa long 37 20 n lat 80 21 w the creek is characterized by predominantly gravel beds with riffle pool step pool log jam structures that drains a catchment of about 1 km2 the creek flows into the james river and eventually into the chesapeake bay the stream generally has higher flows during winter that progressively decrease during the summer period and eventually become intermittent in late summer and early autumn the conservative tracer injections were carried out between may 11 and june 9 2015 during which the flow decreased from 14 to 4 l s injection rates ranged from 100 through 150 ml s were adjusted to raise the specific electrical conductivity by about 100 µs cm beyond the background conductance daily evapotranspiration also imparted variability to the flow during the experiments which manifested more prominently during low flows additional experimental detail can be found in rana et al 2017 the field study selected an 80 m section of the creek control reach of rana et al 2017 for the six tracer experiments e1 through e6 with the nacl solution injection location about 40 m upstream of the beginning of the reach to ensure complete mixing of the tracer specific electric conductance spc was used as a surrogate for nacl concentration which was measured automatically at every 5 sec intervals at the beginning of the reach and at the end of the reach using ysi pro plus multiparameter conductivity probes ysi incorporated yellow springs ohio background spc was automatically measured 20 m upstream of the injection location at every 1 min intervals using a solinst ltc meter ontario canada the background spc remained relatively constant during the experiments with a maximum change of about 2 µs cm the average of the background spc was subtracted from the breakthrough curves before parameter estimation table 1 shows the details of the six experiments and flows in the channel flow was assumed deterministic and was estimated using average plateau spc and a calibration curve developed for the injectate workshop 1990 the important assumptions made by these experiments which are typical of most transient storage studies e g ensign and doyle 2005 are 1 constant channel flow with negligible lateral inflows 2 spatially constant model parameters and 3 temporally constant model parameters the experimental dai number for the six tracer experiments are also shown in table 1 2 3 transient storage parameter estimation we characterized transport parameters using the one dimensional advection dispersion model with well mixed off channel transient storage zones bencala and walters 1983 widely known as the tsm and given as 1 c t q a c x 1 a x a d c x α c s q lin a c lin c 2 s t α a a s c s where c and s are solute concentration ml3 in the main channel and in the transient storage zone respectively t is time t a and a s are cross sectional areas l2 of the main channel and the transient storage zone respectively q is the flow rate l3t 1 d is the dispersion coefficient l2t 1 x is the distance along stream l α is the exchange rate coefficient with the transient storage zone t 1 q lin is the lateral inflow per unit length l2t 1 and c lin is the concentration of the lateral inflow ml 3 the parameters q and q lin were estimated using the average plateau concentrations of the breakthrough curves following dilution gauging techniques and c lin was assumed to be equal to the background concentration the remaining four principal parameters namely d a a s and α were estimated with otis p and otis mc for comparison the unitless damköhler number was calculated as dai α 1 a a s l u where l l is the reach length and u lt 1 is the average velocity in the stream with the boundary conditions of the model fixed with the upstream measurements the four principal tsm parameters were estimated by fitting the downstream concentration using otis p runkel 1998 otis p uses non linear least squares regression to estimate the parameters of tsm by minimizing the sum of squared errors i 1 n ε i 2 c i c i 2 where c and c are the modeled and observed concentrations at the downstream boundary respectively and n is the total number of observations assuming measurement errors are gaussian and identically distributed with zero mean and an unknown variance otis p approximates parameter covariance as 3 c o v θ s 2 j θ t j θ 1 where θ is the non linear least square estimate of the parameter vector θ d a a s α j is the function representing jacobian of the model and s 2 i 1 n ε i 2 n p is the estimate of the unknown variance of measurement errors with p being the number of parameters the accuracy of the estimated parameter covariance and confidence interval using this approximate method critically depends on the degree of non linearity of the model with respect to the parameters aster et al 2005 the same four tsm parameters were estimated using the mcmc method implemented in otis mc which samples the posterior parameter distributions for an assumed error structure e g see vrugt 2016 for example derivation of mcmc for environmental models using bayes rule the posterior probability density function pdf of the parameter vector θ d a a s α is expressed as 4 p θ y l θ y p θ where p θ y and p θ are the posterior and prior parameter distribution respectively y is the vector of observations and l θ y denotes the likelihood function assuming the model residuals for the downstream concentrations are independent and follow a gaussian distribution with zero mean and a constant variance σ 2 as is also assumed in otis p the likelihood of the parameter can be written as 5 l θ y i 1 n 1 2 π σ 2 exp ε i 2 2 σ 2 where σ represents the standard deviation of the measurement error which was assumed to be 0 3 μs cm based on measurement device performance after testing them with multiple conductivity standards the prior distribution p θ was assumed to be a uniform distribution with a lower bounds of zero to maintain non negative parameter estimates we used the metropolis hastings m h algorithm to sample from the posterior distribution eq 4 by forming a markov chain of the parameters θ k k 1 2 m where m is the chain length the m h algorithm gilks et al 1995 which we describe briefly herein is very simple to construct and performs quite well for small number of parameters as in the case of the tsm 1 if k 1 populate θ with initial guesses increment k by one 2 sample a single point of θ from the proposal distribution q θ k θ k 1 3 calculate probability of acceptance ρ min p θ k l θ k y q θ k 1 θ k p θ k 1 l θ k 1 y q θ k θ k 1 1 4 sample u a uniform random variable from 0 1 5 if ρ u accept θ k as a new sample else reject and set θ k θ k 1 6 repeat steps 1 through 6 until k m to adequately represent the distribution of θ a certain portion of the mcmc chain is excised from the head of the chain called the burn in period such that the chain is free from the influence of the initial guesses a gaussian proposal distribution centered around θ k 1 was used for the k th sample θ k n θ k 1 δ where δ is a vector of user defined values that controls the magnitude of the proposed move the value of δ influences the jumping distance and thus controls the overall rate of acceptance i e step 5 of the candidate parameters which is an indicator of efficiency of posterior sampling the ideal acceptance rate varies with the number of parameters and the shape of the posterior but an acceptance rate of 23 44 has been shown to be optimal for the m h algorithm for small problems rosenthal 2011 irrespective of the choice of the proposal distribution q the stationary distribution of the posterior has been shown to converge to the actual posterior distribution asymptotically as m gets large rosenthal 2011 histograms of the parameter chains approximate the parameter distribution as m and estimating parameter uncertainty from the generated histograms is straightforward the 2 5 and 97 5 percentiles give a good representation of the 95 confidence region of the parameters however we should note that technically this is not equivalent to a 95 confidence interval from a frequentist point of view but more akin to a 95 credible interval from a bayesian point of view similarly the prediction interval of the modeled concentrations at the downstream end of the reach were estimated as the 95 percentile of modeled concentration at regular time intervals resulting from the accepted parameter sets excluding burn in for both case studies we selected m 20 000 and a burn in of 30 2 4 setting up and running otis mc otis mc was developed in the c programming language wrapped around the original otis code runkel 1998 written in fortran 77 since they can be easily compiled together e g using a gnu gfortran compiler to ensure user friendliness the goal was to incorporate as little change as possible to the work flow from the original otis otis p setup fig s1 supplementary information shows an example of the configuration of otis mc convergence of the parameter estimates were examined by calculating running mean and standard deviations of the chains excluding burn in which should asymptotically converge to a constant value 3 results 3 1 benchmark application and computation speed the analysis of uvas creek data served as a demonstrative application for otis mc since we could compare the results with the analysis in ward et al 2017 in fig 1 parameter distributions and correlation plots for the uvas creek data are shown below the diagonal and the 95 percentile of the modeled prediction of the breakthrough curves along with the 95 percentile of the residuals are shown in the subplot above the diagonal the correlation coefficients r of the scatter plots are shown on top of the scatter plots with the dotted line showing the linear regression line the median of the parameter distribution with otis mc agrees well with the best fit parameters estimated with otis mcat that are reported in ward et al 2017 table 2 shows the mean of the parameter values and their 95 confidence intervals estimated with otis p otis mcat and otis mc despite the wide ranges in the estimated parameters by the different methods the 95 percentile band of the breakthrough curves using otis mc are relatively narrow with a maximum band width of about 1 5 mg l fig 1 the 95 percentile of the modeled breakthrough curves resembles closely the band of breakthrough curves for the top 1 of the behavioral parameter sets presented in fig 3 of ward et al 2017 which also has a maximum band width of about 1 5 mg l indicating similar predictive capacity of the mcmc and the glue based methodology in terms of computational efficiency the evaluation of 20 000 parameter sets required approximately an hour for the uvas creek data on a dell e6530 laptop 2 7 ghz and 12 gb ram which is about 20 times faster than a similar otis mcat run on the same machine the reason for the higher computation efficiency is because otis mc has been developed as a c wrapper on top of the original otis code written in fortran and as a result the execution time for a single otis mc run is almost as fast as the original otis software additionally the limits on the number of data points for upstream and downstream boundary conditions have been increased from 200 to 20 000 in otis mc 3 2 parameter uncertainty with stream flow in the second case study we analyzed conservative tracer data from six tracer experiments with monotonically decreasing flows due to seasonal baseflow recession except for e5 where rain occurred the day before the dai numbers for the six tracer experiments table 1 are within 0 1 1 0 which is considered ideal for reliable parameter estimation wagner and harvey 1997 with a mean of 0 64 and a standard deviation of 0 17 the dai numbers indicate that similar levels of uncertainty could be expected in the parameters for the six experiments different duration of tracer injections was necessary to ensure that steady state condition was achieved steady state condition is indicated by the leveling of tracer concentration at the measurement location which is also called the tracer plateau condition during low flow conditions a true plateau condition may not be achievable due to diurnal evapotranspiration cycle which is more significant during low flows compared to during high flows for the low flow experiments e4 and e6 it was hard to ascertain steady state condition as concentration kept rising gradually after the initial rapid rise most likely due to evapotranspiration and injection was stopped after a certain duration of injection ideally for a fair comparison of the uncertainty estimates from otis p with uncertainty estimates from otis mc the measurement error variance used in eqs 3 and 5 i e s 2 and σ 2 for each experiment should be same for each experiment otis p estimated s with the optimal parameter estimates from non linear least squares method and ranged 0 4 2 2 and for otis mc we fixed σ 0 3 for all six experiments the smaller value of σ relative to s will result in a more conservative uncertainty estimates from the mcmc method fig 2 shows the parameter uncertainty bounds from otis mc 95 percentile plotted against flow with 95 ci from otis p overlaid on top while the median from otis mc closely resembled optimal otis p estimates the uncertainty estimates of the parameters from otis p were found to be much smaller compared to the percentile bands formed using otis mc even though a more conservative σ was used the growth of uncertainty with increasing flow for each parameter was assessed by comparing the growth of the coefficient of variation cv of the parameters which is the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean of the parameter estimates shown in fig 3 for all parameters cv increased with flow but the increase in cv was the least for a and highest for α with d a close second the uncertainty of parameter estimates from otis mc especially for d and α abruptly increased for flow above 7 l s with the width of the 95 percentile band increasing from the lowest flow to the highest flow experiment by about 5 and 8 times for d and α respectively the growth of cv i e growth in uncertainty of a s was intermediate compared to that of a and α parameter distributions and correlations for the highest flow experiment e1 similar to fig 1 for uvas creek are shown in fig 4 and similar figures for the rest of the experiments are shown in chronological order i e experiment e2 through e6 in figs s2 s6 of the supplementary information strong parameter interactions between a and rest of the parameters were observed the parameters a d and α were strongly correlated while correlations between d a s and α were relatively mild across all experiments d was positively correlated with a as indicated by the positive correlation coefficients on the other hand α was negatively correlated with a as indicated by the negative correlation coefficients on the scatter plots d and α also showed consistent negative correlations for experiment e1 through e6 as q decreased through the experiments the correlation structure appeared to change and the tsm parameters became better resolved with narrower distributions fig 5 shows the observed breakthrough curves at the downstream end of the reach along with the median and 95 percentile range of the modeled concentrations the median of the error residuals are also shown along with the 95 percentile range error residuals and the percentiles were relatively higher near the rising and falling limbs of the breakthrough curves biases in errors became prominent for the two lowest flow experiments e4 and e6 where the plateaus of the breakthrough curves were upward sloping indicating gradual reduction of flow during the courses of the experiments such reduction in flow usually becomes noticeable when stream flow is relatively low and foliage is high such that the diurnal effect of evapotranspiration which peaks during maximum sunshine and is least at night becomes prominent loheide 2008 we note that for the analysis of each of the experiments a constant flow was assumed and such intra experiment flow variability is a source of error as we discuss in the next section 4 discussion the mcmc parameter estimation approach highlighted the limitations of the first order approximate uncertainty estimation method adopted in otis p for the estimation of the tsm parameter uncertainty while the optimal parameter estimates using both methods were reasonably close the comparison between parameter uncertainties estimated using otis mc and approximation from the non linear least squares method otis p showed that the non linear least squares estimates largely underestimated the tsm parameter uncertainty and place undue confidence in the estimated parameters fig 2 also seen by ward et al 2017 the disparity in the estimated uncertainty by otis p and otis mc is indicative of the high degree of non linearity of the tsm the otis p software tool is comparatively much faster and does provide reliable optimal parameter estimates and therefore using otis p in conjunction with otis mc will provide greater insight about the tsm parameters of different streams the presence of such broad uncertainties in the parameters raises important questions such as can the tsm parameters be used to represent physically measurable features of streams or are the parameters much more abstract and integrate the myriad complexity inherent in solute transport mechanism to achieve certain degrees of fit to the measurements zaramella et al 2003 o connor et al 2010 boano et al 2014 zaramella et al 2016 wlostowski et al 2017 correlation of tsm parameter uncertainty with flow thus adds an extra layer of complexity in the interpretation of the solute transport characteristics of a stream the large uncertainty bounds may also increase the difficulty of the assessment of solute processing capacity of stream restoration activities such as artificial weirs and cross vanes unfortunately we cannot make any conclusion about the physics of the correlation between tsm parameter uncertainty and flow just using tracer data alone hence in the following we try to explain the trend in uncertainties in tsm parameters for the stream studied in rana et al 2017 in light of observations made in previous literature 4 1 inter experiment variability for the six tracer experiments the inter experiment trends of the uncertainties of the tsm parameters show that in general the tsm parameters became less important high variance for solute transport prediction for higher flows indicating that solute transport became more advection dispersion dominated and the impact of transient storage waned possible reduction of a s during higher flows fig 2 and also seen by zarnetske et al 2007 may have reduced the relative importance of transient storage area in our creek which may have caused d and α to act on a similar timescale on the breakthrough curve making it harder to separate the impact of the two parameters hence the broader uncertainty as the size of a s increased with decreasing q d and α became more distinguishable in terms of their impact on the breakthrough curves ward et al 2018 conducted four repeated tracer experiments in two reaches and in contrast to our study reported coefficient of variation of a s and α decreasing with flow parameter uncertainties were estimated with otis mcat but increasing for d and a the increasing uncertainty of the parameters seen in our study could also be due to the limited window of detection of the tracer method briggs et al 2009 and as such the different advective timescales during different flow conditions may have given rise to the differences in the parameter uncertainties at different flows even if the underlying transient storage processes remained very similar thus the varying window of detection adds yet another layer of complexity in the evaluation of the tsm parameters the experimental dai number close to 1 0 is considered to be a good indicator of comparable advective and exchange timescales and conducive to parameter estimates with low uncertainty wagner and harvey 1997 showed that the coefficient of variations of a s and α can be expected to be less than 0 1 for experiments with dai number between 0 1 and 1 the dai number for the six experiments calculated using the optimal parameter estimates from otis p i e ignoring the uncertainties in the parameters ranges 0 43 0 84 yet not surprisingly the uncertainties in the estimated parameters were high with coefficient of variation greater than 0 1 for most experiments fig 3 only the stream cross sectional area a was estimated with relatively low coefficient of variation less than 0 1 therefore the dai number calculated with the optimal parameter estimates may not completely explain parameter uncertainties rising from the limited window of detection of the tracer method 4 2 intra experiment variability the intra experiment interactions of a with d and α seen in fig 4 and in figs s2 through s5 supplementary information points to the fact that the parameters d and α can have indistinguishable impact on the tracer breakthrough curve that has also been documented in the literature e g kelleher et al 2013 zaramella et al 2016 since we assumed a constant q during each experiment estimated using average plateau concentrations strong correlation of the parameters with a was tantamount to strong correlation with the inverse of average stream velocity v q a therefore the positive intra experiment correlation between a and d is most likely due to the compensation of loss of advective transport at higher a by the dispersion mechanism on the other hand α was negatively correlated with a for all six experiments and also for the uvas creek experiment therefore the structure of the tsm is such that increasing α has similar effect on the modeled breakthrough curves as decreasing a or increasing v the intra experiment parameter correlations add to the difficulty in isolating the individual effects of the parameters and therefore attempts should be taken to constrain easily measurable parameters using physical measurements in the field as also suggested by neilson et al 2010 schmadel et al 2016 which should reduce uncertainties and improve identifiability of the rest of the tsm parameters examples of relatively easily measurable parameters include a via cross sectional surveys at different sections along the reach independent v measurements using velocity meters and measurement of surface transient storage using acoustic doppler current profilers as performed by phanikumar et al 2007 in depth exploration of field methods to reduce parameter uncertainty via direct measurement of parameters can potentially provide important improvements to transient storage modeling intra experiment flow changes are often assumed negligible as was done here but significant flow change is possible due to evapotranspiration causing temporal variations and lateral inflows and outflows causing spatial variations and are important sources of aleatory uncertainty ward et al 2013 yet tsm parameters for the two lowest flow experiments e4 and e6 figs s3 and s5 supplementary information where we suspect flow varied both temporally and spatially apparently do not exhibit uncertainty bounds drastically different from the other experiments e g e3 and e5 although how the intra experiment variation in q would manifest in the parameter uncertainties is unclear the systematic bias in the error residuals gives us an indication of the violation of our constant q assumption independent flow q measurements at different times of tracer injection would allow the use of variable q in the tsm and may improve tsm parameter estimation 4 3 breakthrough curves and model structure for all experiments large error residuals were observed near the rising and falling limb of the breakthrough curves most dynamic portion of the curves the rising and falling limbs of breakthrough curves thus play a major role in guiding the posterior parameter inference wagener et al 2002 scott et al 2003 wlostowski et al 2017 since the rising and the falling limbs contain a relatively small number of data points compared to the total number of data points their impact will be somewhat reduced and could be increased by using weights for example zaramella et al 2016 proposed splitting the breakthrough curve to calibrate of a and d separately from the transient storage parameters using unique breakthrough curve segments the structure of the tsm itself might be improved to address the aforementioned issues as also pointed out by haggerty et al 2000 briggs et al 2009 our study reveals that while attempts must be taken to reduce the uncertainties of the tsm parameters reporting of detailed uncertainty descriptions of the tsm parameters is extremely important as also suggested by kelleher et al 2013 ward et al 2017 which is sparingly practiced in the literature lastly computational speed is a large barrier to running monte carlo type parameter estimation relatively fast parameter estimation will not only motivate user adoption but may also encourage further improvement of models otis mc being computationally efficient is intended to lower the barrier of using monte carlo based parameter estimation 5 conclusion the parameters of the transient storage model are usually of primary interest as opposed to concentration predictions at different locations and times in different disciplines including hydrology ecology and biogeochemistry we show how the mcmc method can be utilized to generate tsm parameter distributions using a bayesian inference procedure that ensures efficient sampling of the parameter space and generates posterior parameter distribution with minimal subjective choices developed within the original otis code with the c programming language otis mc performs thousands of model runs within hours on a regular personal computer without the need for any proprietary software the code is made available for further modification and extension at https github com sm rana benchmark application of otis mc with the uvas creek dataset demonstrated the efficiency of otis mc and the results were comparable with otis mcat toolbox presented in ward et al 2017 application of otis mc on a single reach in a series of six experiments with different flows demonstrated that flow significantly controlled the tsm parameters parameter uncertainty was higher during high flows even though the dai numbers for the six experiments indicated to similar levels of reliability for the estimated parameters correlation between parameters were seen during all six experiments pointing to the difficulty in parameter isolation the mcmc based uncertainty estimates were much larger than the approximate uncertainty estimates provided by the non linear least squares method implemented within otis p our analysis of tsm parameter uncertainty demonstrated methodological difficulty as also indicated by several studies before in terms of estimating all four tsm parameters without using external measurements to constrain some of the parameters a calibrated tsm can provide solute transport predictions that match the observed data well but relating the tsm parameters to the physical properties of streams and similarly predicting tsm parameters using physical stream characteristics remains difficult if not impossible a combination of external measurements and modification advancement to the transport model might be necessary to understand the underlying processes that impact solute transport as such future tracer studies should include adequate external measurements to constrain tsm parameters and provide adequate descriptions of parameter uncertainties such that proper assessment of the stream reach transient storage is possible declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

6406,modeling and mapping of floods using one 1d and two dimensional 2d models has resulted in significant progress in our understanding of river hydraulics and hydrology the existing modeling approach can be improved further through a better understanding of the interactions between river hydrodynamics and subsurface processes saturated conditions in subsurface and floodplains can lead to longer and deeper inundation from low intensity but continuous flood events to understand the combined effect of surface subsurface hydrology and hydrodynamics on streamflow generation and subsequent inundation during floods this study uses an integrated surface water groundwater sw gw modeling approach for simulating flood conditions simulation of a high flooding event for the upper wabash river basin in indiana usa shows that the river floodplain hydrodynamics is simulated more accurately without the need for extensive calibration by using a two dimensional integrated sw gw model additionally an integrated model provides a more realistic simulation of flood hydrodynamics for different antecedent soil conditions specifically results show that the streamflow flood stages and inundation area obtained for the dry scenario are significantly lower when compared to the saturated scenario these findings are further validated by applying the integrated modeling approach for an entirely different watershed croton river in the state of new york overall the findings from this study suggest that the current practice of simulating floods which assumes an impervious surface may not be providing realistic estimates of flood inundation and that an integrated approach incorporating all the hydrologic and hydraulic processes in the river system must be adopted 1 introduction most flood models are primarily driven by an upstream flow boundary condition to simulate the river hydrodynamics in one or two dimensions to get the water surface elevation wse velocity and extent of inundation for a study reach the key inputs for this approach include topography to define the river geometry streamflow and the roughness coefficient manning s n it is well documented in the literature that the current flood modeling approach is affected by several uncertainties arising from discharge estimates topographic data model selection and parameterization among others cook and merwade 2009 hall et al 2005 legleiter et al 2011 merz and thieken 2005 pappenberger et al 2006 saksena and merwade 2015 straatsma and huthoff 2011 some of these uncertainties can be addressed by using accurate topographic data at fine resolution bhuyian et al 2015 saksena and merwade 2015 accurate discharge data and better model parameterization and calibration through satellite based products cohen et al 2018 dey et al 2019 di baldassarre et al 2009 schumann et al 2007 one of the limitations of simulating floods in rivers using a hydrodynamic model is that it cannot incorporate the interaction between the river reach and the subsurface which can play a critical role in dictating the duration and extent of inundation this interaction becomes even more critical when floods are simulated over a larger stream network as opposed to individual reaches for example models such as rapid routing application for parallel computation of discharge lisflood fp and autoroute bates and de roo 2000 david et al 2011b follum et al 2016 have been applied at the river network scale but these models simulate only the surface water hydrodynamics one way these models compensate for excluding some of the related physical processes in the flood hydrodynamics is through the calibration of surface roughness in the form of the manning s n parameter mukolwe et al 2014 pappenberger et al 2005 this calibration is generally performed by estimating stage or streamflow at the downstream model boundary in some studies the extent of inundation located inside the model domain obtained from remote sensing is used to calibrate roughness parameters di baldassarre et al 2009 thus the current hydrodynamic modeling approach assumes that the observed streamflow stage and extent of inundation are solely functions of the roughness parameter distribution upstream streamflow forcing and topography bales and wagner 2009 dimitriadis et al 2016 teng et al 2017 however studies have shown that several combinations of roughness parameters even unrealistic ones can produce reasonable results for a specific event but not necessarily for events outside the calibration range especially for events with different antecedent conditions pappenberger et al 2006 2005 nevertheless this practice of ignoring physical processes variability has continued despite several studies concluding that the lack of linkage between surface water sw and groundwater gw contributions leads to uncertainties in the existing flood risk models kidmose et al 2015 pahar and dhar 2014 panday and huyakorn 2004 numerous models exist to individually simulate overland flow river hydraulics and gw flow but these models do not account for relative interactions between these processes fleckenstein et al 2010 faulkner et al 2012 osei twumasi et al 2016 additionally several past studies have highlighted the importance of subsurface contributions and antecedent conditions on the streamflow hydrograph berthet et al 2009 cooper and rorabaugh 1963 hughes et al 2011 moench et al 1974 but how the sw gw interaction affects the flow hydrodynamics between the river and its floodplain needs more investigation this study is advocating that floods should be simulated using an integrated sw gw modeling approach that is based on the solution of the mass balance equation at every time step and can provide a more physical representation of the river floodplain hydrodynamics by simultaneously incorporating physical processes such as precipitation vadose zone storage hydraulic routing and gw flow in the past integrated sw gw modeling procedures were deemed unsuitable primarily due to the absence of accurate data and insufficient computational power grimaldi et al 2013 saleh et al 2011 as a result studies focused on creating tools for loosely coupling hydraulic and hydrologic models david et al 2011a jackson and maidment 2014 but these techniques fail to incorporate real time impacts of sw gw interaction in floodplains during high flows with the increasing access to open source datasets and computational capabilities more studies are focusing on using integrated sw gw modeling procedures to simulate the hydrology and hydrodynamics of rivers gleeson and manning 2008 kaser et al 2014 kollet and maxwell 2008 liu et al 2015 saksena and merwade 2017a however many of these studies have focused on simulating hydrologic fluxes such as streamflow soil moisture and water table wt depth without looking at how the interactions between some of these fluxes will affect the flood hydrodynamics and the subsequent inundation during a high flow event this study aims to address this gap by applying an integrated sw gw model over a relatively large area greater than 5000 km2 watershed considering that an integrated sw gw model provides a better streamflow prediction this study hypothesizes that such a model will also provide more accurate and robust simulation of the flood hydrodynamics with less dependence on hydraulic model calibration using manning s n specifically this study aims to prove that both the upstream and downstream boundary conditions in a flood model are dynamic and they are not only influenced by the surface water flow but also by sw gw interactions 2 study area and data the upper wabash river uwr basin in indiana 5840 km2 is chosen as the test site for this study the uwr basin is characterized by glacial till deposits gentle slopes fertile soils and shallow aquifers with a deep confining layer of shale frisbee et al 2017 saksena and merwade 2017b according to the national resources conservation services nrcs hydrologic soil group classification table 1 there is a dominance of soil group c for the uwr basin with an average vadose zone depth of 150 cm and a shallow wt around the wabash river although the watershed is primarily agricultural the wabash river floodplain consists of three major cities in indiana namely lafayette logansport and huntington additionally according to the flood insurance rate maps firms in this region over 8 of the entire study area 468 km2 falls under the 100 year flood zone because of the existence of dams and control structures on the wabash river only the unregulated region in the uwr basin shown in fig 1 is selected for this analysis table 1 presents a summary of the watershed characteristics for the study area considering the critical role of topography in hydrodynamic simulation of rivers saksena 2015 a 9 m resolution topographic digital elevation model dem of high accuracy based on a lidar survey obtained from the indiana spatial data portal isdp is used in this study the sw gw integration for uwr basin is achieved by linking the unsaturated vadose zone with the overland flow region and the saturated zone surficial aquifer this type of modeling for a large area is data intensive and requires surface information in the form of topography land use and surface roughness manning s n climate information in the form of rainfall and streamflow and subsurface information in the form of vadose zone and aquifer properties the land use data for the study

on flood inundation modeling and application over a large area interconnected channel and pond routing icpr fig 2 is used in this study icpr is a fema approved integrated hydraulic and hydrologic model for the state of florida that has been extensively validated for both sw and gw simulations across several watersheds in the united states streamline technologies 2016 icpr is a two dimensional 2d integrated sw gw modeling software based on distributed model parameterization procedures streamline technologies 2018 the icpr model has capabilities of combining precipitation 2d surface flow pond storage and gw simulations for both event based and continuous storm events ahmad et al 2014 booker 2006 jackson and maidment 2014 joyce et al 2017 singhofen and mcclung 2014 as shown in fig 2 there are three basic components of an integrated icpr model 1 the surface system 2 the vadose zone and 3 the saturated groundwater system detailed description on these components including the methodology used to couple surface and subsurface systems is provided below 3 1 the surface system icpr uses a finite volume approach for surface flow using unstructured mesh networks momentum equations with options for energy and diffusive wave equations are lumped along triangle edges and the mass balance equations appendix a eqs a 4 a 7 are lumped at the triangle vertices where irregular shaped polygons are formed establishing local control volumes this set of polygons is referred to as the surface honeycomb mesh as shown in fig 3 the polygons are formed by connecting adjacent triangle midpoints and centroids a diamond mesh is also formed along triangle edges for roughness classification as shown in fig 3 and extends from vertices to adjacent triangle centroids streamline technologies 2018 the advantage of using unstructured networks in characterizing the topography and hydrologic processes is well documented in previous studies begnudelli and sanders 2006 bunya et al 2010 icpr allows the application of variable surface roughness for shallow and deep overland flow during large flood events the roughness changes over time when the depth of the water in the floodplain increases due to persistent flooding arcement and schneider 1984 popular hydraulic models such as the hydrologic engineering center s river analysis system hec ras and lisflood fp do not account for this variability bates and de roo 2000 brunner 2010 icpr uses an exponential decay function presented in appendix a eqs a 11 and a 12 dependent on surface depth to incorporate the variability in surface roughness the shallow and deep roughness values corresponding to the nlcd land use classes are directly obtained from the maximum and minimum roughness values from chow 1959 and are shown in table 2 3 2 the vadose zone the vadose zone forms the primary communication link between the surface and groundwater systems icpr has several options for modeling the vadose zone streamline technologies 2018 including the green ampt method single homogeneous layer discretized into two cells a refined green ampt method single homogeneous layer discretized into user specified number of computational cells and the vertical layer method soil properties vary by layer and each layer is further discretized into multiple cells in all three cases the brooks corey soil water retention hydraulic conductivity relationship rawls et al 1982 rawls and brakensiek 1982 is used to determine unsaturated conductivities based on current soil moisture contents the refined green ampt method is used in this study because it provides a more realistic distribution of soil moisture in the soil column compared to the standard green ampt method in this method the soil moisture accounting and subsequent gw recharge from the vadose zone is computed using a non iterative kinematic approach unlike the standard green ampt method that permits only one soil moisture value within a single computational element e g honeycomb or grid the refined green ampt allows the entire unsaturated soil zone to be divided into multiple cells as illustrated in fig 4 which can contain different moisture contents based on the volume of water percolating into the vadose zone in essence the refined green ampt method is identical to the vertical layer method except that the soil parameters are homogeneous for a given soil zone the non iterative kinematic approach involves two passes through the various cells for every time step the first pass is from the ground surface downward to the last cell water enters the soil column at the top of the first cell based on an infiltration rate that cannot exceed the saturated vertical conductivity the fluxes are calculated at the bottom of each cell based on the current moisture content in a cell and the corresponding unsaturated vertical conductivity as estimated by the brooks corey method appendix a eq a 13 a mass balance is performed for each cell based on the flux into the cell from its upper face minus the flux out of the cell across its bottom face the moisture contents are updated based on the fluxes the flux across the bottom face of the last cell is removed from the vadose zone and delivered to appropriate groundwater node in the second pass the cells are rebalanced from the bottom to the surface to ensure that the moisture content in any cell does not exceed saturation at this step if any cell contains water in excess of saturation the difference excess water content is moved upward to adjacent cells and eventually delivered to the surface system if necessary since the wt is dynamic the cells are swallowed as the wt moves upward therefore if a cell is inundated by more than 75 due to the rising wt it is merged with the saturated cell below it and the soil moisture is redistributed accordingly similarly as the wt drops the moisture content of the newly exposed portion of a given cell is automatically set to field capacity if more than 25 of a given cell is exposed it becomes active again the 75 threshold for merging cells and 25 threshold for unmerging cells as the wt moves upwards or downwards is provided to ensure continuity and consistency in the wetting and drying of cells in the vadose zone the volume of water available for infiltration at every time step is calculated as the rainfall volume in that time plus the volume of water ponded on the surface minus the amount of evapotranspiration et the potential evapotranspiration pet at every time step is first removed from the rainfall volume and ponded water in case the amount of pet required is higher than the rainfall and ponded water the difference is extracted from the soil column available for et ground surface to root depth the current soil moisture content in each cell is adjusted based on actual et aet requirements before proceeding with the unsaturated vertical flow computations the reference evapotranspiration ret in icpr is calculated using the penman monteith equation appendix a eq a 14 the empirical equations provided in allen et al 1998 are used in conjunction with meteorological data to calculate the ret since the ret is calculated assuming the surface to be turf grass in good condition the ret is converted into pet using crop coefficients which can vary based on the crop type soil type and time of year evapotranspiration is not included in the first part of this study described in section 4 as it deals with event based simulations however et calculations are included for the continuous simulations presented in section 5 4 3 3 the saturated groundwater system a finite element approach with a six point quadratic triangular element as described by martínez 1989 is used in icpr to solve the continuity equation appendix b eq b 1 for unsteady phreatic two dimensional groundwater flow streamline technologies 2018 nodes are placed at triangle vertices and midpoints along the triangle edges like the surface flow computational mesh polygons are formed around the triangle vertices polygons are also formed around the triangle midpoints this set of polygons is referred to as the subsurface honeycomb 3 4 integrating surface and subsurface systems the surface and subsurface honeycomb meshes are simultaneously intersected with soils land use and rainfall zone thematic polygon map layers fig 3 forming a system of sub polygons or soil cylinders each soil cylinder has a surface node a groundwater node as well as soil land use and rainfall zone attributes a portion of the rainfall may enter the soil column and flow vertically through the vadose zone water that does not enter the soil column is assigned to its respective surface node water is aggregated if multiple soil cylinders share the same surface node and then moved horizontally on the surface along triangle edges any water for a given soil cylinder crossing the interface between the vadose zone and the saturated zone is aggregated and delivered to its respective groundwater node if the soil column becomes saturated and the surface is inundated a known head condition is applied to the corresponding groundwater node based on the surface node stage seepage into or out of the groundwater system at that location is calculated by the groundwater model and removed from or delivered to the surface node 3 5 time marching scheme the coupling sequence between the vadose zone the surface hydraulics and the saturated groundwater system is as follows 1 start incrementing the hydrology clock vadose zone 2 start incrementing surface hydraulics clock until it catches up to the hydrology clock 3 if the hydrology clock is less than the groundwater clock plus groundwater time increment go to step 1 and 4 start incrementing the groundwater clock the hydrology vadose zone and groundwater time increments are static the hydrology time increment is usually several minutes in duration whereas the groundwater time increment is typically an hour or longer hydrology runoff rates are saved at the beginning and end of a hydrology time increment and delivered to the appropriate surface node ponded water at the beginning of the hydrology time increment is applied across the full hydrology time increment groundwater recharge volume based on fluxes across the vadose zone saturated zone interface is aggregated and delivered to the groundwater model at its time increment the surface hydraulics time increment is typically in seconds or fractions of seconds in duration and operates between a user specified minimum and maximum time increment there are two 2 time marching options in icpr the first option is a successive approximation technique with over relaxation saor this is an iterative solution that solves for heads at nodes and flow rates along triangle edges it has an adaptive time step and changes between user specified minimum and maximum time increments however a constant time step is used throughout the computational mesh at a given point in time consequently the time step is typically driven by the node with the least amount of storage the second option used in this study is based on a second order runge kutta technique modified euler method that varies the time step not only in time but also spatially domingues et al 2008 it is referred to as the fireball method in icpr and is 2 5 to 30 times faster than the saor method for large projects streamline technologies 2018 the method involves establishing a set of time step levels at the beginning of a simulation based on the minimum and the maximum calculation times with each successive level doubling in duration for example if the minimum and maximum calculation times are set to 0 01 and 5 12 s respectively then ten 10 time step levels are established and routing calculations are based on these time step levels a maximum allowable time step is then determined for each node based on inflows outflows and available storage such that the change in stage does not exceed the user specified change in stage tolerance which is typically set such that the mass balance error is minimal the time steps are rounded down to the closest time step level following which a pass is made through the entire network beginning at nodes with the lowest time step level to ensure that the neighboring nodes do not increase more than one time step level for example if a total of ten 10 time step levels are chosen the inner most level with the smallest time step will be calculated 512 times compared to the outer most level with the largest time step but the neighboring cells do not increase by more than one level once all cells on all time step levels are calculated the maximum allowable time steps for all the nodes are re evaluated and the process is repeated a finite element time marching scheme is used for the groundwater model based on a quadratic shape function the algorithm solves for heads at every node triangle vertex and midpoint in the computational mesh in this study the hydraulic routing time interval is set between 0 01 and 5 12 s ten time steps the hydrology is updated after every 300 s 5 min and the groundwater flows seepages and recharge rates are calculated at every hour 3600 s 4 methodology the overall goal of this study is to show that an integrated sw gw modeling approach provides more robust and accurate results compared to the conventional surface water modeling approach this goal is accomplished by creating three modeling configurations fig 4 by gradually increasing physical complexity to show the relative improvement in the model results more details on these configurations including the steps involved in creating them are provided below 4 1 creation of icpr model configurations 4 1 1 surface model discretization c1 the c1 model represents a 2d surface water model which uses gage data at upstream usgs stations and routes the water solely based on topographic variation and roughness characteristics this configuration represents the default conventional approach to flood modeling driven by upstream discharge hydrograph the elevation data for this model is obtained from the gridded 9 m resolution lidar the river geometry for this configuration is defined using a flexible triangular mesh such that it is dense in the channel and its floodplain as shown in fig 3 and coarse for the land surface away from the river to reduce computation time this flexible mesh structure ensures that the mass balance is simulated accurately where most of the water transport is taking place the triangular mesh in icpr is overlain on the lidar dem and the elevation of lidar cell directly intersecting with a specific triangular vertex is extracted and assigned to the vertex the flow hydrodynamics is simulated by using a 2d overland flow routing that is based on the solution of diffusive wave formulations appendix a eqs a 8 a 10 additionally c1 does not require any additional hydrologic inputs e g rainfall since it has no subsurface connectivity and is based solely on the traditional hydraulic routing techniques used for estimating flood depths and extent of inundation basically the ground surface is assumed to be impervious for c1 and the streamflow from eight upstream gages are routed without any rainfall thereby representing a configuration that is synonymous to the traditional 2d surface water routing models such as hec ras 2d and lisflood fp this triangular mesh for the 2d overland flow region is generated using the breakline and breakpoint feature in icpr the breakline feature is a polyline shapefile generated by digitizing the river channels in the study area using aerial imagery and lidar data each point used to create the polyline breakline feature is assigned a triangular vertex node in icpr and the triangle edges are formed along the polyline therefore the channel flow rates are computed along the triangle edges within the icpr computational scheme since more points are required to digitize river bends the resultant mesh is denser along the river bends and at confluences since the dem resolution for the lidar data is 9 m the breakline feature is digitized such that the minimum distance between any two vertices is 9 m and the maximum edge length along straight channels is 27 m therefore the average triangular edge length in the river channels is 15 m for mesh digitization outside the river channels the breakpoint feature which is a point shapefile is used for mesh generation every point in the breakpoint shapefile is assigned a triangular vertex in the mesh and these features can be automatically generated in icpr at a specified distance for more information on breakpoints and breaklines please refer to streamline technologies 2018 using this principle triangular breakpoint patterns with an average edge length of 60 m and 300 m are assigned inside and outside the floodplain respectively 4 1 2 subsurface model discretization c2 and c3 the overland flow in c1 configuration is modified to include two subsurface configurations in the first modification referred to as c2 the overland flow can only interact with the unsaturated soil layer vadose zone with a static wt the vadose zone thickness is determined using gssurgo data for the region which remains constant throughout the simulation the c2 configuration is like other commonly used hydrologic models such as hec hms and swat that route the rainfall excess surface flow and the water percolating beyond the vadose zone is lost as aquifer recharge the initial soil moisture in the vadose zone is assumed to be equivalent to field capacity at the beginning of the simulation as mentioned in section 3 2 the water movement in the vadose zone and subsequent gw recharge is computed using the refined green ampt method streamline technologies 2018 a total of twenty five cells are used for the vadose zone in this study initially all the cells start with the same parameters as shown in table 2 but the moisture content across each cell can vary with time as the fluxes through each individual cell are tracked in both upward and downward directions during the simulation at each time step the wetting front moves through individual unsaturated cells which are wetted or dried using the available soil storage and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity fig 4 provides an illustration of the vadose zone discretized into multiple cells which are used to redistribute the soil moisture in the third configuration referred to as c3 the wt in c2 is made dynamic so the water that percolates beyond the vadose zone is used to increase the storage in the surficial aquifer which results in the rise of the wt similarly during dry conditions the wt recedes and increases the vadose zone depth along with vertical movement of the wt c3 also incorporates gw contributions from horizontal gradients causing seepage fronts that discharge into the wabash river within the subsurface in c3 the gw recharge rates from the vadose zone for a given wt elevation are converted to a volume which is based on the hydrological computational time increments this volume in turn determines the change in the wt elevation for the next time increment to simulate the gw dynamics in c3 an initial wt surface is required at the beginning of the simulation to generate this surface first the wt depth contours obtained from idnr s potentiometric surface maps are interpolated using the inverse distance weighting idw method to form a wt depth raster at a spatial resolution of 30 m second this wt depth raster is subtracted from the ground lidar resampled to 30 m to obtain a wt elevation surface third this surface is imported into an initial version of the c3 model which is then simulated at steady state for one month using the daily average streamflow for the streams in the watershed finally it is assumed that the wt surface reaches equilibrium at the end of this steady state simulation the wt surface obtained at the end of the steady state simulation is used as the initial wt surface for the c3 model used in this study within the surficial aquifer the gw flow is calculated using the 2d unsteady phreatic solution of the continuity equation using a finite element formulation more specifically a six point triangular element is used with a quadratic interpolation function and the system of equations is solved using the cholesky method kuiper 1981 martínez 1989 a 2d subsurface discretization also allows c3 to account for the non uniform distribution of the hydraulic properties in the vadose zone and surficial aquifer kollet and maxwell 2006 since the gw processes operate at larger spatial scales compared to sw processes bloschl and sivapalan 1995 wood et al 1988 a coarser resolution mesh with an average edge length of 45 m in the channel 240 m in the floodplain and 900 m outside the floodplain is created a detailed description of the modification of the continuity equation for finite element formulation is described in appendix b and can also be accessed from icpr s technical reference manual streamline technologies 2018 table 2 presents the uncalibrated green ampt parameters used for c2 and c3 and surficial aquifer parameters used for c3 that are classified based on soil zones and the type of aquifer system respectively the gssurgo database contains spatially distributed hydrologic soil group classification based on runoff potential and the four soil zones used in this study are based on this classification the saturated vertical conductivity moisture content at field capacity and at wilting point presented in table 2 reflect the median values of the specific soil zones in the gssurgo database the other parameters require information on the soil texture percentages which are also available from the gssurgo database using the soil texture percentages and the equations provided in rawls 2004 the other subsurface parameters such as pore size index soil matric potential and residual moisture content are evaluated streamline technologies 2018 for the gw zones the map of the spatial distribution of different unconsolidated aquifer systems for indiana is available from igic s indiana map server http maps indiana edu index html the aquifer properties for wabash valley are obtained from a study on the investigation of groundwater resources in indiana pohlmann 1987 4 2 model simulations using three configurations the three configurations are run in an unsteady state to simulate hourly streamflow stage and extent of inundation for a month from april 11th 2013 to may 10th 2013 during this period multiple rainfall events of varying magnitude were observed in indiana that resulted in a peak streamflow corresponding to a 50 year return period in the wabash river at lafayette the first 5 days of simulation are used for model initialization which is completed when all the models reach equilibrium and all reaches are connected the equilibrium is reached when the mass balance error in the system stabilizes to a value less than 1 the outputs from the three model configurations are compared with observed data for the next 25 days at the watershed outlet a period of 25 days is chosen to simulate both high and low flow conditions that occurred during and after the storm event respectively evapotranspiration is not included in c2 and c3 during the one month simulation based on the assumption that the effect of et would be negligible during a short and extremely wet period the input parameters are kept unchanged for different model configurations because the goal is to investigate the sensitivity of flood simulation from the three configurations to subsurface flow integration under normal climatic conditions it should also be noted that the model comparisons are based on uncalibrated parameter inputs because calibration can result in unrealistic representation of relative contributions from the overland and subsurface processes due to the existence of equifinality pappenberger et al 2005 beven 1993 after applying the three models to simulate the one month period the streamflow stage and extent of inundation are evaluated and compared between models the stage is evaluated by subtracting the channel bed elevation at the gage from the wse the stage is used instead of wse as wse is a scale dependent parameter which can create bias in the results due to the elevation or altitude of the location the relative performance of these models is also evaluated by comparing the simulated results with observed data 4 3 statistical comparison of model configurations in order to evaluate the goodness of fit between the three configurations and observed data the coefficient of determination r2 is calculated while r2 is used as a measure of linear trend the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 which reflects the overall fit of a hydrograph is also evaluated similarly the slope parameter which provides a measure of overprediction or underprediction of model outputs with increasing magnitude is evaluated in addition percent bias pbias sorooshian et al 1993 a statistic used to measure if the average tendency of simulated data is larger or smaller than observed data is also calculated gupta et al 1999 finally the rmse observations standard deviation ratio rsr which is a scaled normalized parameter is evaluated to estimate the variation in model residuals 4 4 spatial aggregation and computational performance of model configurations as mentioned in section 3 the icpr model uses a flexible spatiotemporal structure for the surface and gw regions the application of flexible resolution spatial mesh and variable hydraulic time steps 0 01 to 5 12 s significantly improves the computational efficiency of these models for large watersheds table 3 presents the spatial aggregation parameters of the surface and gw meshes provided in parenthesis for c3 generated for the uwr basin fig 3 since the same surface mesh is used for the three configurations the number of triangles and the mean triangular area is the same to compare the spatial resolution of triangulated irregular networks tins with gridded dems vivoni et al 2005 used two spatial aggregation parameters the horizontal point density d and the equivalent cell size r e which can be evaluated using eqs 1 and 2 1 d n t n g 2 r e a n t where d horizontal point density n t number of triangular nodes or vertices n g number of dem nodes r e equivalent cell size or length scale and a basin area the number of dem nodes n g are evaluated using the 9 m lidar for the surface region and the 30 m initial wt raster for the gw region the r e values for the surface 156 m and gw 428 m meshes represent the equivalent spatial resolution of the tins used in this study similarly the d values provide a ratio of the number of computational elements used in the surface 0 003 and gw 0 004 meshes in comparison to the fixed resolution gridded dems the models used in this study are simulated on a 4 core intel i 7 system with a processing speed of 3 7 ghz the build process involves generation of the meshes required for simulation intersection of all input datasets to extract model parameters and assignment of nomenclature to mesh nodes and vertices as shown in table 3 the build and simulation times for c1 and c2 are very similar as the hydrodynamic processes control the total simulation time for both configurations the build and simulation times for c3 are 120 and 60 longer than c1 although c3 requires a longer computational time the computational efficiency of c3 can be increased significantly by increasing the number of simulation cores as the sw and gw regions can be parallelized in icpr even without parallelization a one month simulation can be completed in approximately one day highlighting the overall computational efficiency of the flexible spatiotemporal structure used in this study 5 results and discussion the results are presented in four parts i comparison of the three model configurations c1 c2 and c3 ii quantification of the relative contribution of watershed processes during flooding iii evaluating the effect of antecedent soil conditions on flood outputs and iv further validation of results by applying c3 under different flow and watershed conditions 5 1 comparison of the three model configurations 5 1 1 comparison of model outputs with observed data in this section the observed streamflow and stage is compared with the simulated streamflow and stage for c1 c2 and c3 respectively it should be noted that all the models begin from the same initial surface storage and c1 does not have any infiltration into the soil column the results presented in fig 5 a show that c1 overpredicts the streamflow significantly near the peak and underpredicts during low flows this result suggests that the surface water models produce higher outflow during flood events as the water flowing into the surface system inflow is fully recovered as either surface storage or outflow since the inflow volume in c1 is not removed from the surface system due to the absence of processes like infiltration evapotranspiration gw seepage and recharge the resulting outflow volumes are higher for c1 on the other hand c2 severely underpredicts the streamflow during low flow conditions but predicts the peak streamflow accurately when compared to observed data while a portion of the infiltrated water is stored in the vadose zone and some is delivered to the surface as excess runoff in c2 most of the water exits the system by percolating out of the vadose zone and is lost as subsurface recharge resulting in an underprediction in c2 due to a better physical process representation c3 performs well in predicting the streamflow for the entire duration of the simulation fig 5b suggests that c1 fails to predict the stage accurately for the duration of the simulation in comparison to streamflow the error in estimating stage for all models is less severe near the hydrograph peak because the stage is more resistant to fluctuations in streamflow when the water inundates outside the main channel and into the floodplain causing a significant increase in the flow area additionally a change in streamflow can also affect the flow velocities resulting in a less severe impact on stage the scatterplots about the line y x shown in fig 5c and d further highlight the overall accuracy of c3 in estimating streamflow and stage the streamflow and stage hydrographs for the three configurations highlight the importance of including a dynamic wt and a variable vadose zone thickness in the context of streamflow generation current hydrologic models such as hec hms and swat are severely limited in considering this dynamic nature to improve the prediction using such models the parameters need to be calibrated to produce a best fit combination of parameters arnold et al 2012 zhang et al 2013 however this process of calibration does not guarantee model performance during different hydrologic and climatic conditions liew et al 2005 schuol and abbaspour 2006 assuming a fixed vadose zone thickness can also restrict the maximum volume of water available to plants in the root zone which in turn may influence other processes such as evapotranspiration which is a dominant variable during normal climatic conditions here c2 represents hydrologic models that do not account for groundwater movement and therefore underpredicts the streamflow and stage c3 includes a dynamic wt along with the surficial aquifer characterization which significantly improves the prediction the c3 outflows suggest that the total amount of water infiltrating into the subsurface reduces on inclusion of a dynamic wt additionally a fraction of the water is also recovered from the subsurface in the form of seepage due to the direct interaction of the wt with the surface which contributes towards a more accurate low flow estimation even though c2 has a better physical process representation than c1 its performance is worse than c1 as shown in table 4 and fig 5 these results suggest that a fixed vadose zone model that permits water percolation into an infinite gw region without properly quantifying recharge and wt location performs worse than simply using a model with an impervious surface c1 to improve the performance of models like c2 it may be more beneficial to restrict the percolation out of the unsaturated zone by assuming an impervious bottom soil layer thereby providing a fixed storage in the soil system this modification can reduce the underprediction in c2 as it may improve the simulation of hortonian runoff infiltration excess even though dunne runoff saturation excess may not be simulated accurately without proper conceptualization of gw processes xie et al 2003 for events that are primarily affected by hortonian runoff the error induced by excluding gw processes may be offset by incorporating an unsaturated zone without gw recharge however several factors can result in hortonian runoff dominated events across watersheds for example the spatial heterogeneity in soil properties antecedent soil conditions watershed topography and rainfall intensity therefore before choosing a model configuration like c2 these factors should be considered otherwise the results may not be accurate without gw incorporation as shown in this study fig 6 shows the wse and top width for the three configurations at a cross section just upstream of the outlet the results from c2 suggest that there is no inundation in the floodplain and the water remains inside the main channel for the lowest flow however both c1 and c3 suggest inundated floodplains near the outlet the top width and wse at low flows are similar for both c1 and c3 the top width across the channel for peak flow is highest for c1 whereas the difference between c2 and c3 is not as appreciable when compared to low flows a higher top width for c1 during peak flow is representative of higher outflow volumes as shown in fig 5a and a smaller top width during low flows is indicative of the underprediction by c2 fig 7 presents the flood inundation maps near the wabash tippecanoe confluence for the highest peak and lowest streamflow during the simulation the difference in the location and magnitude of inundation between the three models is evident from the flood maps at peak streamflow fig 7a c for c2 the inundation area measured at both peak and lowest streamflow is significantly lower fig 7b and e than c1 and c3 as shown in table 4 the peak flow flood inundation area is smallest for c2 155 1 km2 followed by c1 171 4 km2 and c3 188 2 km2 overall c3 has the highest flood inundation extent since it accounts for surface ponding during extreme rainfall as the subsurface becomes saturated additionally water seeping laterally from the rivers into the subsurface can seep out elsewhere causing ponding therefore c3 can capture river floodplain interactions across both the surface and subsurface regions in contrast c1 only shows inundation due to riverine flow that inundates into the floodplain and hence the flooding is localized around the river channel the flood inundation area corresponding to the lowest flow for c1 119 4 km2 and c3 118 9 km2 are approximately equal which suggests the traditional surface water routing approach and the integrated approach produce similar results during low flows when the water remains inside the river channels the results presented in this section suggest that the overall model performance for c3 is superior when compared to c1 and c2 however the extent of inundation does not depend only on streamflow and stage but also on the accuracy of topographic data in this study the extent of inundation estimated by the model configurations is not compared with observed flood inundation and therefore it is essential to note that the flood inundation maps presented here only provide a relative difference between the model configurations from a watershed perspective if the inflow and outflow from the watershed is predicted accurately the extent of inundation will be a function of the resolution and vertical accuracy of topographic data 5 1 2 statistical comparison of model performance fig 5 suggests that c3 performs best when compared to observed flow however it is essential to evaluate model performance statistics to further validate these conclusions table 5 presents the statistical parameters for evaluating goodness of fit between the three models and observed data the statistical performance of the models in estimating streamflow suggests that c3 r2 0 95 performs best followed by c1 r2 0 85 and c2 r2 0 80 as mentioned earlier the stage is evaluated by subtracting the bed elevation from the wse at the outlet the model performance in estimating stage suggests that c3 has a high r2 value of 0 95 but both c1 and c2 have a diminished performance with r2 values of 0 81 and 0 78 respectively a very low nse for c2 in estimating streamflow and stage indicates an unacceptable performance moriasi et al 2007 even though c1 and c3 have comparable r2 values high nse values of 0 94 and 0 93 in estimating streamflow and stage clearly suggest that c3 has a very good performance when compared to observed data based on the model evaluation guidelines by moriasi et al 2007 while both c1 and c3 underpredict the rising limb of the hydrograph the overall slope in comparison to the line y x is close to 1 which indicates that neither of the models are consistently overpredicting or underpredicting the streamflow overall c3 performs better statistically in estimating streamflow highlighted by a lower pbias 6 0 compared to c1 8 6 similarly c3 also has a better performance in estimating stage as shown by a very low pbias 3 2 compared to c1 6 6 and c2 22 4 a low slope 0 77 for c2 indicates that the model underpredicts the streamflow consistently even though the relative error in peak streamflow table 4 is very small 2 2 in addition c3 has a lower rsr when compared to c1 and c2 which further highlights the improvement in model performance due to an accurate representation of physical processes since an inaccurate mesh resolution can cause mass balance errors in the model the performance of the three configurations is tested for two additional mesh resolutions including one that is coarser and another that is finer than the one presented in this study the overall conclusions did not change but the degree of improvement compared to the observed data was different when using a coarser mesh resolution for example the reported r2 values when using a coarser mesh resolution for c1 c2 and c3 are 0 59 0 76 and 0 85 respectively and therefore the integrated model performed better regardless of the mesh resolution using the mesh resolution finer than the one used in this study did not provide any additional improvement in the results for any configurations 5 2 quantification of the relative contribution of watershed processes the results in the previous section signify the importance of integrating rainfall and subsurface flow with surface water models for production of flood inundation maps c3 is uncalibrated and yet the performance statistics suggest that this model predicts both the streamflow and stage accurately for the simulation period in addition to reducing calibration uncertainty it is also essential to quantify the contributions from different watershed processes during flood events this analysis can help in highlighting which process plays a dominant role in exacerbating or attenuating the flood responses to quantify the relative contribution of different processes during a storm event the volumetric contributions from hydraulic routing vadose zone and gw recharge are evaluated for c3 since estimating the exact flow paths for gw flow regimes is beyond the scope of this study and is less relevant in the context of flood prediction the volumetric contribution divided by the watershed area mm is used as a metric for quantifying the relative contributions from different physical processes fig 8 a presents the streamflow hydrograph for c3 which is used as a metric to evaluate the volume of water leaving the watershed through the surface fig 8b shows the stream inflow which is the cumulative volumetric inflow into the model from all eight upstream usgs gage stations for c3 and the stream outflow which is the cumulative volume of water discharging or leaving the system from the model outlet which is located at usgs gage 03335500 wabash river at lafayette fig 8b also presents δsurface storage which provides a cumulative estimate of the increase or decrease in the surface water volume in the river floodplain system for the entire watershed when flood responses are mapped without rainfall and subsurface integration for example c1 the difference in stream inflow and stream outflow should represent the change in surface water inundation for the watershed for c3 on the other hand the δsurface storage is also a function of rainfall excess and gw seepage fig 8c shows precipitation which is the cumulative rainfall for the entire drainage area during the entire simulation period the rainfall excess shown in fig 8c represents the hourly excess rainfall volume which is delivered to the surface as runoff from the vadose zone after evaluating infiltration and initial abstraction losses therefore this represents the volume of runoff per hour that causes surficial ponding and subsequent inundation the gw recharge shown in fig 8d represents the volume of water removed from the vadose zone due to downward percolation which is delivered to the groundwater system as recharge in addition when the wt rises and intercepts the surface the water is discharged to the surface system as lateral seepage shown in fig 8d therefore both rainfall excess and lateral seepage contribute additional volume to the surface system during flood events thereby resulting in increased flood inundation which is highlighted in table 4 and fig 7 the hydrograph in fig 8a highlights that c3 can capture streamflow variability throughout the simulation on the other hand in addition to the overprediction near the hydrograph peak c1 underpredicts streamflow after a simulation time of 220 h as highlighted in fig 5a as shown in fig 8d the subsurface storage increases significantly during peak rainfall intensity which accounts for reduction in overall surface storage thereby producing a more accurate streamflow prediction during high flow conditions after the rainfall event the vadose zone storage recedes resulting in more gw recharge this increase in potentiometric head in the surficial aquifer causes increased lateral seepage fig 8d from the subsurface into the river system this lateral seepage volume results in a more accurate streamflow prediction during low flow conditions for c3 after 400 h as shown in fig 8a when compared to c1 which does not capture the increased streamflow due to gw seepage therefore subsurface processes influence both the streamflow and the surface water inundation throughout the simulation these results further highlight the shortcomings of the current surface water models that route the streamflow solely based on roughness coefficients while c1 overestimates the streamflow for this watershed the absence of subsurface processes can lead to an underprediction of streamflow in gw dominated watersheds to rectify this overprediction underprediction in streamflow modelers calibrate the roughness coefficients for decreasing increasing the flow velocities thereby changing the volume of water intercepted in the surface system this practice of calibrating often improves the model results for specific events however without a true representation of the streamflow attenuation or amplification caused by subsurface processes these models can produce erroneous flood estimates for other events moore and doherty 2005 5 3 evaluating the effect of antecedent soil conditions on flood outputs the results from the previous sections highlight the influence of subsurface processes on flood responses the analysis in this section aims to evaluate the potential of existing vadose zone moisture content and wt location in controlling surface water inundation and streamflow generation therefore only the subsurface component of c3 is modified in this step the hypothesis is that the wt location determines the control of groundwater in redistributing soil moisture upwards in the vadose zone which further impacts the land surface inundation three soil moisture scenarios are used to represent dry moderate and wet conditions for the dry scenario d the initial soil moisture in the vadose zone is near wilting point and the average depth of wt is approximately 6 m floods occurring during this scenario are synonymous to heavy rainfall occurring when dry conditions have existed for a long time before the event similarly for the wet scenario w the vadose zone is very shallow depth to wt 0 5 m and the degree of saturation in the vadose zone ranges between 0 90 and 0 95 therefore even a small amount of percolation can saturate the vadose zone as the initial soil moisture is very close to the porosity flooding in this scenario is synonymous to two extreme rainfall events occurring one after the other the moderate scenario m represents the case where the soil moisture is at field capacity and the wt is at an intermediate depth of 1 5 m from the surface which also represents the nrcs s average vadose zone depth of 150 cm the initial stage surface is imported from c3 using the stage outputs just before the 50 year storm event the three scenarios d w and m are run in an unsteady state to simulate hourly flood inundation and streamflow outputs for the storm event and the comparisons are used to analyze the influence of existing subsurface conditions on flooding the results in table 6 suggest that there is a significant difference in both the streamflow outputs and inundation area obtained using the three scenarios the m scenario is considered as the base model to evaluate the relative difference when dry and wet conditions exist table 6 also shows that there is a 10 8 increase and a 3 7 decrease in peak streamflow for w and d respectively in addition the flood inundation area obtained using d is less severe 12 2 due to completely dry subsurface conditions and more severe 40 5 due to completely saturated subsurface conditions for w as shown in fig 9 for the same amount of precipitation the cumulative change in vadose zone storage fig 9c is highest for d followed by m and lowest for w since w has a nearly saturated vadose zone a larger portion of the rainfall is redistributed to the surface as excess rainfall which directly affects the peak inundation area table 6 additionally this also results in significantly higher gw recharge volumes throughout the simulation for w therefore when the subsurface is saturated the peak streamflow cumulative outflow volume and gw recharge increase substantially the flood inundation maps presented in fig 9e g represent the extent of inundation across the three configurations at the exact instance of time when the peak streamflow is observed at the outlet the flood inundation map shown in fig 9g suggests that the extent of inundation at peak streamflow also increases when saturated conditions w exist as there is no infiltration into the subsurface in addition to higher gw contributions due to lateral seepage when the wt interacts with the surface it should be noted that these instantaneous maps do not show the maximum inundation in the watershed during the simulation period which can even occur before or after the peak streamflow is observed as shown in table 6 there is only a 3 7 difference in the peak streamflow for the dry and moderate conditions therefore when the peak streamflow is observed there is very small difference in the extent of inundation between the dry and moderate configurations as shown in fig 9e and f however table 6 suggests that there is an overall difference of 12 2 in the maximum inundation area between the two configurations suggesting that the maximum inundation at specific locations may have occurred at different times the results validate the hypothesis that the location of the wt and existing soil moisture influence the overall flood inundation outputs the hypothetical phenomenon presented here using the w scenario highlights the potential of a fully saturated subsurface in increasing flood risk which was observed during both hurricane frances and hurricane matthew weaver et al 2016 generally floods corresponding to a specific return period have a standard map with a fixed extent of inundation for example 100 year firms however due to existing saturated conditions flooding from a 100 year flood event can be more severe than anticipated therefore static flood maps should also be created based on antecedent soil moisture conditions as well as the wt location for coastal aquifers that are prone to hurricane induced rainfall containing a shallow wt and a higher antecedent soil moisture these flood maps should be re evaluated using integrated models so that the true flood risk can be estimated 5 4 further validation of c3 model the results from the previous sections highlight the advantage of integrating hydraulic and hydrologic processes for simulating flood responses to validate these findings and further analyze the difference in the existing flood modeling approach c1 and the integrated modeling approach c3 two models for the uwr basin referred to as c1 uwr and c3 uwr are simulated for a long continuous three month period from february 15th to may 15th 2018 using the same model parameters the first two days are used as warm up period and the results are compared against observed data at the outlet wabash river at lafayette from february 17th to may 15th 2018 the results shown in fig 10 and table 7 clearly highlight the advantage of using an integrated modeling approach for flood prediction the hydrograph in fig 10c highlights that c3 uwr can capture streamflow variability throughout the simulation which can be seen from the superior nse 0 97 pbias 4 2 and peak flow error 5 3 on the other hand c1 uwr fig 10a overpredicts the streamflow for high and moderate flows throughout the simulation which is highlighted by the nse 0 92 pbias 12 1 and peak flow error 14 9 additionally the results from figs 5 and 10 suggest that both c1 and c3 can capture the low flows accurately the accurate performance of c1 during low flows in streamflow dominated streams like the wabash river highlights its applicability in conditions where the water remains inside the river channel and the volume of water exchanged between the river and subsurface is insignificant in comparison to streamflow finally the results also validate the applicability of the refined green ampt method used in this study for continuous simulations to warrant a broader applicability of the integrated modeling approach the c1 and c3 configurations are also tested for another watershed with significantly different physical characteristics from the uwr basin therefore the east branch croton river cr basin with a drainage area of 210 km2 situated in the state of new york usa is chosen as an additional validation site as shown in fig 11 the land use for the cr basin is characterized by 56 forest cover 23 developed 11 agriculture and 10 water on the other hand the land use for the uwr basin comprises of 7 forest 9 developed 82 agriculture and 2 water table 1 highlighting the difference in the physical characteristics between the two watersheds additionally unlike the wabash river which is channel flow dominated the croton river is a rainfall runoff dominated stream surrounded by wetlands the outlet of the cr basin is located at the usgs gage 01374505 east branch croton river at brewster ny as shown in fig 11 to aid a more extensive validation the performance of c1 and c3 is also compared against observed data inside the watershed at an additional usgs gage 0137449480 east branch croton river near putnam lake ny using the same modeling approach as the uwr basin two models for the cr basin referred as c1 cr and c3 cr are simulated for a continuous seven month period from march 1st to september 30th 2011 to provide a longer time for incorporating antecedent conditions in the integrated model the first two months are used as warm up period and the results are compared with the observed data from may 1st to september 30th 2011 the results fig 12 highlight the inability of c1 cr to capture streamflow variability in small rainfall runoff dominated catchments especially for low flows as shown in fig 12c and table 7 c1 cr overpredicts both the high and low flows at brewster nse 0 18 pbias 86 3 and error peak flow 23 4 it is evident from fig 12d that c3 cr nse 0 85 pbias 4 2 and error peak flow 21 1 has a superior performance compared to c1 cr the difference in the performance between the two configurations becomes wider during long term continuous simulations especially for small rainfall events a possible explanation for this difference is the shallow channel conveyance and existence of wetlands around the croton river which can cause higher river floodplain interactions even during low flows resulting in streamflow attenuation during small events which is evident from fig 12b and d when considering only the high flows which are more relevant to flood modeling the performance of c1 cr is comparable to c3 cr at brewster the difference in performance is also observed at putnam inside the watershed where c1 cr nse 0 50 pbias 64 8 and error peak flow 41 6 overpredicts the streamflow fig 12a during the continuous simulation and c3 cr nse 0 95 pbias 6 1 and error peak flow 12 1 captures the hydrograph variability including the peak flows more accurately fig 12b the results from fig 12 and table 7 highlight the broader applicability of the integrated modeling approach c3 for watershed with distinct physical characteristics as highlighted in section 5 3 incorporating accurate antecedent conditions is highly essential in improving the predictive capacity of integrated models this is also evident from the accurate performance of c3 cr for which a sufficiently long warm up period is chosen 2 months to incorporate antecedent conditions more accurately therefore during event scale flood modeling the rainfall distribution and streamflow patterns prior to the event should be carefully analyzed and saturated dry or moderate soil moisture distribution should be used for characterizing initial conditions depending on the hydrologic time series preceding the flood events being simulated while the performance of c3 is superior to c1 in both watersheds this does not necessarily mean that the integrated models will obviously outperform the overland flow flood models across all watersheds since the physical processes involved in hydraulic and hydrologic modeling are scale dependent the application of integrated modeling may not achieve significant improvements compared to using simpler surface water transport models at small spatial scales for channel flow dominated streams when the influence of rainfall and subsurface processes is diminished 6 summary and conclusions generally hydrologic models are calibrated for streamflow while hydraulic models are calibrated for stage and extent of inundation however these three variables streamflow stage and extent of inundation are linked together and are a function of multiple variables including topography rainfall soil type land use subsurface storage and evapotranspiration this study highlights the discrepancies in simulating the river hydrodynamics when some of the underlying processes are not incorporated in the model specifically the results from this study highlight the advantages of using integrated sw gw models in simulating flood hydrodynamics the following conclusions are drawn from this study 1 a comparison of the model configurations shows that c1 produces the highest outflow volume since the change in storage is only dependent on topographic gradients and surface roughness while c2 produces the smallest outflow volume since the water percolating below the vadose zone is lost from the water balance the existence of dynamic wt in c3 reduces the water lost from the system and therefore the outflow volume is higher than c2 overall c3 produces the highest nse and lowest pbias in estimating streamflow and stage compared to observed data 2 looking at only the impact of streamflow in affecting the extent of inundation the results from this study hint at an underprediction of the extent of inundation by using the conventional surface water modeling approach c1 or c2 compared to c3 however in the absence of observed extent of inundation this conclusion needs further evaluation 3 most hydraulic models are calibrated by modifying the roughness coefficients but the results from this study show that an incorporation of the sw gw dynamics within the river system c3 can improve the performance of models in estimating streamflow and stage without any extensive calibration this reinforces the notion that the dynamic river stage should be simulated by including sw gw interactions in the model instead of only calibrating the roughness coefficient 4 the existing wt location and antecedent soil moisture conditions can have a significant impact on the streamflow stage and flood inundation area the results suggest that saturated subsurface conditions w can severely increase the inundation area on the other hand dry subsurface conditions d can reduce the overall impact of flood events incorporating accurate antecedent conditions is essential for predicting flood responses accurately and therefore adequate warm up period should be chosen for integrated models depending on the spatial scale of the watershed and temporal scale of simulations 5 the validation of c3 for an independent continuous 3 month simulation for the uwr basin and for a 5 month simulation for the cr basin with different physical characteristics highlights the broad applicability of the integrated modeling approach although the results from this study are promising and the modeling approach proposed here is relatively more comprehensive some of the modeling components can be further improved to enhance the findings for example this study incorporates soil redistribution in the vadose zone using vertically homogeneous soil zones where the soil moisture and subsequent gw recharge is computed using a non iterative kinematic approach and hence the integrated models do not incorporate lateral flows in the vadose zone this assumption works well for large flood events with a high intensity of rainfall as the soil moisture profile closely resembles a sharp wetting front cylinder however infiltration does not occur cylindrically instead percolates through the soil system in three dimensions lateral flows can not only influence the volume and location of gw recharge but also the magnitude of streamflow although the residence time may be large hughes 2010 this study assumes that the vertical percolation dominates during the simulation period which may not be true during low flow conditions or in other watersheds for a more realistic estimation of the soil moisture redistribution during continuous simulations numerical solution of the 3d richards equation using finite element formulations can be used however obtaining adequate data to parameterize a 3d model of unsaturated low is very difficult additionally when dealing with large watersheds representing the vadose zone using the 3d form of richard s equation becomes computationally expensive and impractical for the purpose of flood modeling in this regard models such as parflow and hydrogeosphere which offer a fully integrated 3d solution of unsaturated and saturated subsurface flow aided by high performance computing can be incorporated in future studies brunner and simmons 2012 kollet and maxwell 2006 finally the effect of preferential flows is also neglected in this study preferential flow through macropores can bypass the entire unsaturated soil column and accelerate the transport of water into the streams alaoui et al 2011 therefore preferential flow through the soil matrix should be incorporated in regions where the soil properties are conducive for its existence although obtaining accurate data to characterize the preferential flow paths is very challenging it should be noted that the antecedent initial soil conditions are chosen at field capacity for all simulations of the integrated c3 model this is done as the exact soil moisture distribution is unknown at the beginning of the simulation similarly the initial wt surface used in c3 is generated by simulating steady state conditions for one month and assuming that the wt surface is in equilibrium further this study uses contour maps for calculating the initial wt depths but these maps are sparsely distributed and are not available for majority of the watersheds in the world therefore it is possible that the superior performance of the c3 model is influenced by the choice of antecedent soil moisture distribution and the availability of accurate wt information for the uwr basin in indiana in the absence of such information it is necessary to incorporate a substantially long warm up period e g two months for cr basin which can help in balancing the soil moisture profile before the actual event is simulated however this warm up period should be chosen depending on the scale of the watershed magnitude of the event and climatic conditions preceding the event for accurately incorporating the antecedent conditions berthet et al 2009 pathiraja et al 2012 zehe and blöschl 2004 similarly the initial wt location for integrated modeling can be simulated by assuming that the wt is located at a fixed depth below the ground surface e g 2 m for the cr basin followed by a rebalancing of the wt hydraulic heads using a long steady state simulation this method is used to initialize the wt for the c3 cr model and the results presented here support its applicability another alternative to this approach is to start the model simulation during a dry season by assuming completely saturated subsurface conditions wt ground surface and simulating the model for a period of more than three months to let the model obtain equilibrium before the onset of the rainy wet season regardless these methods need to be validated across several other watersheds with different physiological characteristics to justify a broader applicability evapotranspiration is an important physical process that can impact river hydrodynamics and other hydrologic variables in the water cycle especially during continuous simulations of several months one of the limitations of this study is that et is only incorporated in the 7 month simulation of the cr basin section 5 4 as shown in the results the absence of et does not affect the performance of c3 in estimating streamflow and stage for the uwr basin this could be due to the large spatiotemporal scale of rainfall distribution high relative humidity and cloud cover over many days in the simulation period while the impact of et may be less significant for the events in this study the absence of et may result in erroneous estimation of streamflow and stage during other events and at other locations therefore the effect of et should be incorporated in future studies for long term continuous integrated modeling another limitation of this study is the absence of stormwater drainage system in the models especially for croton river basin with a 23 developed area the water discharging into the open channels from the storm drains can influence the magnitude of peak streamflow time of peak and duration of inundation in urban areas however studies on distributed modeling of urban areas have shown that the impact of stormwater drainage in affecting streamflow is diminished during extreme events as the conveyance in the open channels is significantly higher than stormwater drains ogden et al 2011 regardless storm drains can increase flood peaks in the river channels during small to moderate rainfall events and therefore should be included in future studies especially during continuous simulations containing multiple rainfall events while the effect of urban stormwater system is not included in this study the effect of imperviousness in developed regions resulting in reduced infiltration is incorporated in the watersheds used in this study while it may be argued that the integrated model performance is specific to the watersheds used for the analysis the broader goal here is to highlight the reduction in modeling uncertainties when sw gw interactions are incorporated in modeling and mapping the flood inundation watersheds with different physical characteristics react to rainfall events of similar magnitude and intensities differently similarly the groundwater characteristics of the region control the amount of seepage recharge and wt fluctuations therefore the integration of subsurface processes may achieve improvements of different degrees for watersheds depending on the physiographic and hydrogeologic characteristics however even a watershed with a completely different land use classification aquifer characterization and soil classification can be modeled accurately when the physical processes driving the hydrologic variability are incorporated for example a watershed with an urban land use low infiltration capacity and clayey aquifer will undergo diminished sw gw interactions while the gw recharge and vadose zone storage might reduce in such a scenario excess rainfall contributions due to increased impervious cover and reduced infiltration will become more significant and the inability of traditional streamflow driven flood models to account for excess rainfall in the watershed may still result in poor performance alternatively if excess rainfall and infiltration calculations are integrated with channel flow for such watersheds it might yield a more realistic representation of the river floodplain hydrodynamics and therefore the overall flood prediction would be more reliable therefore future studies should incorporate the effect of antecedent atmospheric and subsurface conditions in flood models for more reliable flood determination declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements

thoughtful and constructive feedback appendix a this section provides supplementary information on the overland flow processes including the relevant equations and numerical formulations that are used in this study although icpr includes both one dimensional 1d and two dimensional 2d surface flow 1d flow is not used in this study regardless the basic computational framework for both 1d and 2d surface is based on the node link concept using a finite volume approach that allows for a single fully integrated system of equations to be developed and solved simultaneously therefore the 1d and 2d surface hydraulics do not have to be coupled nodes are specific locations in the modeling domain where wse are calculated links are used to connect and move water from one node to another the surface flows are calculated along the links based on the wse values at the connecting nodes some of the examples of 1d links include pipes weirs channel segments bridges and pump stations the rainfall runoff occurs for basins or catchment areas and runoff from the basins is delivered to the surface nodes although not used in this study the traditional hydrologic methods such as the nrcs unit hydrograph method can also be used in icpr a flexible triangular computational mesh is used for 2d overflow and is generated automatically based on the various graphical features developed by the modeler the vertices of the triangles are treated as nodes and the sides of the triangles become overland flow links the control volumes are formed around the vertices and extend to the midpoints of the triangle sides and to the geometric center of the triangle as shown in fig a 1 a the control volumes become the catchment areas for the rainfall runoff processes the collection of control volumes is referred to as the honeycomb mesh which is intersection with soils and land use maps forming a system of sub polygons see fig a 1 b rainfall is applied to each sub polygon and any water that is does not percolate into the soil is aggregated by the respective control volume and delivered to the corresponding 2d surface node a diamond mesh as depicted in fig a 1 c is simultaneously formed along the

formed around the triangle vertices although homogeneous soil zones are used the soil column is discretized into multiple computational cells and soil moisture is tracked for each cell as described in

6406,modeling and mapping of floods using one 1d and two dimensional 2d models has resulted in significant progress in our understanding of river hydraulics and hydrology the existing modeling approach can be improved further through a better understanding of the interactions between river hydrodynamics and subsurface processes saturated conditions in subsurface and floodplains can lead to longer and deeper inundation from low intensity but continuous flood events to understand the combined effect of surface subsurface hydrology and hydrodynamics on streamflow generation and subsequent inundation during floods this study uses an integrated surface water groundwater sw gw modeling approach for simulating flood conditions simulation of a high flooding event for the upper wabash river basin in indiana usa shows that the river floodplain hydrodynamics is simulated more accurately without the need for extensive calibration by using a two dimensional integrated sw gw model additionally an integrated model provides a more realistic simulation of flood hydrodynamics for different antecedent soil conditions specifically results show that the streamflow flood stages and inundation area obtained for the dry scenario are significantly lower when compared to the saturated scenario these findings are further validated by applying the integrated modeling approach for an entirely different watershed croton river in the state of new york overall the findings from this study suggest that the current practice of simulating floods which assumes an impervious surface may not be providing realistic estimates of flood inundation and that an integrated approach incorporating all the hydrologic and hydraulic processes in the river system must be adopted 1 introduction most flood models are primarily driven by an upstream flow boundary condition to simulate the river hydrodynamics in one or two dimensions to get the water surface elevation wse velocity and extent of inundation for a study reach the key inputs for this approach include topography to define the river geometry streamflow and the roughness coefficient manning s n it is well documented in the literature that the current flood modeling approach is affected by several uncertainties arising from discharge estimates topographic data model selection and parameterization among others cook and merwade 2009 hall et al 2005 legleiter et al 2011 merz and thieken 2005 pappenberger et al 2006 saksena and merwade 2015 straatsma and huthoff 2011 some of these uncertainties can be addressed by using accurate topographic data at fine resolution bhuyian et al 2015 saksena and merwade 2015 accurate discharge data and better model parameterization and calibration through satellite based products cohen et al 2018 dey et al 2019 di baldassarre et al 2009 schumann et al 2007 one of the limitations of simulating floods in rivers using a hydrodynamic model is that it cannot incorporate the interaction between the river reach and the subsurface which can play a critical role in dictating the duration and extent of inundation this interaction becomes even more critical when floods are simulated over a larger stream network as opposed to individual reaches for example models such as rapid routing application for parallel computation of discharge lisflood fp and autoroute bates and de roo 2000 david et al 2011b follum et al 2016 have been applied at the river network scale but these models simulate only the surface water hydrodynamics one way these models compensate for excluding some of the related physical processes in the flood hydrodynamics is through the calibration of surface roughness in the form of the manning s n parameter mukolwe et al 2014 pappenberger et al 2005 this calibration is generally performed by estimating stage or streamflow at the downstream model boundary in some studies the extent of inundation located inside the model domain obtained from remote sensing is used to calibrate roughness parameters di baldassarre et al 2009 thus the current hydrodynamic modeling approach assumes that the observed streamflow stage and extent of inundation are solely functions of the roughness parameter distribution upstream streamflow forcing and topography bales and wagner 2009 dimitriadis et al 2016 teng et al 2017 however studies have shown that several combinations of roughness parameters even unrealistic ones can produce reasonable results for a specific event but not necessarily for events outside the calibration range especially for events with different antecedent conditions pappenberger et al 2006 2005 nevertheless this practice of ignoring physical processes variability has continued despite several studies concluding that the lack of linkage between surface water sw and groundwater gw contributions leads to uncertainties in the existing flood risk models kidmose et al 2015 pahar and dhar 2014 panday and huyakorn 2004 numerous models exist to individually simulate overland flow river hydraulics and gw flow but these models do not account for relative interactions between these processes fleckenstein et al 2010 faulkner et al 2012 osei twumasi et al 2016 additionally several past studies have highlighted the importance of subsurface contributions and antecedent conditions on the streamflow hydrograph berthet et al 2009 cooper and rorabaugh 1963 hughes et al 2011 moench et al 1974 but how the sw gw interaction affects the flow hydrodynamics between the river and its floodplain needs more investigation this study is advocating that floods should be simulated using an integrated sw gw modeling approach that is based on the solution of the mass balance equation at every time step and can provide a more physical representation of the river floodplain hydrodynamics by simultaneously incorporating physical processes such as precipitation vadose zone storage hydraulic routing and gw flow in the past integrated sw gw modeling procedures were deemed unsuitable primarily due to the absence of accurate data and insufficient computational power grimaldi et al 2013 saleh et al 2011 as a result studies focused on creating tools for loosely coupling hydraulic and hydrologic models david et al 2011a jackson and maidment 2014 but these techniques fail to incorporate real time impacts of sw gw interaction in floodplains during high flows with the increasing access to open source datasets and computational capabilities more studies are focusing on using integrated sw gw modeling procedures to simulate the hydrology and hydrodynamics of rivers gleeson and manning 2008 kaser et al 2014 kollet and maxwell 2008 liu et al 2015 saksena and merwade 2017a however many of these studies have focused on simulating hydrologic fluxes such as streamflow soil moisture and water table wt depth without looking at how the interactions between some of these fluxes will affect the flood hydrodynamics and the subsequent inundation during a high flow event this study aims to address this gap by applying an integrated sw gw model over a relatively large area greater than 5000 km2 watershed considering that an integrated sw gw model provides a better streamflow prediction this study hypothesizes that such a model will also provide more accurate and robust simulation of the flood hydrodynamics with less dependence on hydraulic model calibration using manning s n specifically this study aims to prove that both the upstream and downstream boundary conditions in a flood model are dynamic and they are not only influenced by the surface water flow but also by sw gw interactions 2 study area and data the upper wabash river uwr basin in indiana 5840 km2 is chosen as the test site for this study the uwr basin is characterized by glacial till deposits gentle slopes fertile soils and shallow aquifers with a deep confining layer of shale frisbee et al 2017 saksena and merwade 2017b according to the national resources conservation services nrcs hydrologic soil group classification table 1 there is a dominance of soil group c for the uwr basin with an average vadose zone depth of 150 cm and a shallow wt around the wabash river although the watershed is primarily agricultural the wabash river floodplain consists of three major cities in indiana namely lafayette logansport and huntington additionally according to the flood insurance rate maps firms in this region over 8 of the entire study area 468 km2 falls under the 100 year flood zone because of the existence of dams and control structures on the wabash river only the unregulated region in the uwr basin shown in fig 1 is selected for this analysis table 1 presents a summary of the watershed characteristics for the study area considering the critical role of topography in hydrodynamic simulation of rivers saksena 2015 a 9 m resolution topographic digital elevation model dem of high accuracy based on a lidar survey obtained from the indiana spatial data portal isdp is used in this study the sw gw integration for uwr basin is achieved by linking the unsaturated vadose zone with the overland flow region and the saturated zone surficial aquifer this type of modeling for a large area is data intensive and requires surface information in the form of topography land use and surface roughness manning s n climate information in the form of rainfall and streamflow and subsurface information in the form of vadose zone and aquifer properties the land use data for the study

model for the state of florida that has been extensively validated for both sw and gw simulations across several watersheds in the united states streamline technologies 2016 icpr is a two dimensional

pond storage and gw simulations for both event based and continuous storm events ahmad et al 2014 booker 2006 jackson and maidment 2014 joyce et al 2017 singhofen and mcclung 2014 as shown in fig 2 there are three basic components of an integrated icpr model 1 the surface system 2 the vadose zone and 3 the saturated groundwater system detailed description on these components including the methodology used to couple surface and subsurface systems is provided below 3 1 the surface system icpr uses a finite volume approach for surface flow using unstructured mesh networks momentum equations with options for energy and diffusive wave equations are lumped along triangle edges and the mass balance equations appendix a eqs a 4 a 7 are lumped at the triangle vertices where irregular shaped polygons are formed establishing local control volumes this set of polygons is referred to as the surface honeycomb mesh as shown in fig 3 the polygons are formed by connecting adjacent triangle midpoints and centroids a diamond mesh is also formed along triangle edges for roughness classification as shown in fig 3 and extends from vertices to adjacent triangle centroids streamline technologies 2018 the advantage of using unstructured networks in characterizing the topography and hydrologic processes is well documented in previous studies begnudelli and sanders 2006 bunya et al 2010 icpr allows the application of variable surface roughness for shallow and deep overland flow during large flood events the roughness changes over time when the depth of the water in the floodplain increases due to persistent flooding arcement and schneider 1984 popular hydraulic models such as the hydrologic engineering center s river analysis system hec ras and lisflood fp do not account for this variability bates and de roo 2000 brunner 2010 icpr uses an exponential decay function presented in appendix a eqs a 11 and a 12 dependent on surface depth to incorporate the variability in surface roughness the shallow and deep roughness values corresponding to the nlcd land use classes are directly obtained from the maximum and minimum roughness values from chow 1959 and are shown in table 2 3 2 the vadose zone the vadose zone forms the primary communication link between the surface and groundwater systems icpr has several options for modeling the vadose zone streamline technologies 2018 including the green ampt method single homogeneous layer discretized into two cells a refined green ampt method single homogeneous layer discretized into user specified number of computational cells and the vertical layer method soil properties vary by layer and each layer is further discretized into multiple cells in all three cases the brooks corey soil water retention hydraulic conductivity relationship rawls et al 1982 rawls and brakensiek 1982 is used to determine unsaturated conductivities based on current soil moisture contents the refined green ampt method is used in this study because it provides a more realistic distribution of soil moisture in the soil column compared to the standard green ampt method in this method the soil moisture accounting and subsequent gw recharge from the vadose zone is computed using a non iterative kinematic approach unlike the standard green ampt method that permits only one soil moisture value within a single computational element e g honeycomb or grid the refined green ampt allows the entire unsaturated soil zone to be divided into multiple cells as illustrated in fig 4 which can contain different moisture contents based on the volume of water percolating into the vadose zone in essence the refined green ampt method is identical to the vertical layer method except that the soil parameters are homogeneous for a given soil zone the non iterative kinematic approach involves two passes through the various cells for every time step the first pass is from the ground surface downward to the last cell water enters the soil column at the top of the first cell based on an infiltration rate that cannot exceed the saturated vertical conductivity the fluxes are calculated at the bottom of each cell based on the current moisture content in a cell and the corresponding unsaturated vertical conductivity as estimated by the brooks corey method appendix a eq a 13 a mass balance is performed for each cell based on the flux into the cell from its upper face minus the flux out of the cell across its bottom face the moisture contents are updated based on the fluxes the flux across the bottom face of the last cell is removed from the vadose zone and delivered to appropriate groundwater node in the second pass the cells are rebalanced from the bottom to the surface to ensure that the moisture content in any cell does not exceed saturation at this step if any cell contains water in excess of saturation the difference excess water content is moved upward to adjacent cells and eventually delivered to the surface system if necessary since the wt is dynamic the cells are swallowed as the wt moves upward therefore if a cell is inundated by more than 75 due to the rising wt it is merged with the saturated cell below it and the soil moisture is redistributed accordingly similarly as the wt drops the moisture content of the newly exposed portion of a given cell is automatically set to field capacity if more than 25 of a given cell is exposed it becomes active again the 75 threshold for merging cells and 25 threshold for unmerging cells as the wt moves upwards or downwards is provided to ensure continuity and consistency in the wetting and drying of cells in the vadose zone the volume of water available for infiltration at every time step is calculated as the rainfall volume in that time plus the volume of water ponded on the surface minus the amount of evapotranspiration et the potential evapotranspiration pet at every time step is first removed from the rainfall volume and ponded water in case the amount of pet required is higher than the rainfall and ponded water the difference is extracted from the soil column available for et ground surface to root depth the current soil moisture content in each cell is adjusted based on actual et aet requirements before proceeding with the unsaturated vertical flow computations the reference evapotranspiration ret in icpr is calculated using the penman monteith equation appendix a eq a 14 the empirical equations provided in allen et al 1998 are used in conjunction with meteorological data to calculate the ret since the ret is calculated assuming the surface to be turf grass in good condition the ret is converted into pet using crop coefficients which can vary based on the crop type soil type and time of year evapotranspiration is not included in the first part of this study described in section 4 as it deals with event based simulations however et calculations are included for the continuous simulations presented in section 5 4 3 3 the saturated groundwater system a finite element approach with a six point quadratic triangular element as described by martínez 1989 is used in icpr to solve the continuity equation appendix b eq b 1 for unsteady phreatic two dimensional groundwater flow streamline technologies 2018 nodes are placed at triangle vertices and midpoints along the triangle edges like the surface flow computational mesh polygons are formed around the triangle vertices polygons are also formed around the triangle midpoints this set of polygons is referred to as the subsurface honeycomb 3 4 integrating surface and subsurface systems the surface and subsurface honeycomb meshes are simultaneously intersected with soils land use and rainfall zone thematic polygon map layers fig 3 forming a system of sub polygons or soil cylinders each soil cylinder has a surface node a groundwater node as well as soil land use and rainfall zone attributes a portion of the rainfall may enter the soil column and flow vertically through the vadose zone water that does not enter the soil column is assigned to its respective surface node water is aggregated if multiple soil cylinders share the same surface node and then moved horizontally on the surface along triangle edges any water for a given soil cylinder crossing the interface between the vadose zone and the saturated zone is aggregated and delivered to its respective groundwater node if the soil column becomes saturated and the surface is inundated a known head condition is applied to the corresponding groundwater node based on the surface node stage seepage into or out of the groundwater system at that location is calculated by the groundwater model and removed from or delivered to the surface node 3 5 time marching scheme the coupling sequence between the vadose zone the surface hydraulics and the saturated groundwater system is as follows 1 start incrementing the hydrology clock vadose zone 2 start incrementing surface hydraulics clock until it catches up to the hydrology clock 3 if the hydrology clock is less than the groundwater clock plus groundwater time increment go to step 1 and 4 start incrementing the groundwater clock the hydrology vadose zone and groundwater time increments are static the hydrology time increment is usually several minutes in duration whereas the groundwater time increment is typically an hour or longer hydrology runoff rates are saved at the beginning and end of a hydrology time increment and delivered to the appropriate surface node ponded water at the beginning of the hydrology time increment is applied across the full hydrology time increment groundwater recharge volume based on fluxes across the vadose zone saturated zone interface is aggregated and delivered to the groundwater model at its time increment the surface hydraulics time increment is typically in seconds or fractions of seconds in duration and operates between a user specified minimum and maximum time increment there are two 2 time marching options in icpr the first option is a successive approximation technique with over relaxation saor this is an iterative solution that solves for heads at nodes and flow rates along triangle edges it has an adaptive time step and changes between user specified minimum and maximum time increments however a constant time step is used throughout the computational mesh at a given point in time consequently the time step is typically driven by the node with the least amount of storage the second option used in this study is based on a second order runge kutta technique modified euler method that varies the time step not only in time but also spatially domingues et al 2008 it is referred to as the fireball method in icpr and is 2 5 to 30 times faster than the saor method for large projects streamline technologies 2018 the method involves establishing a set of time step levels at the beginning of a simulation based on the minimum and the maximum calculation times with each successive level doubling in duration for example if the minimum and maximum calculation times are set to 0 01 and 5 12 s respectively then ten 10 time step levels are established and routing calculations are based on these time step levels a maximum allowable time step is then determined for each node based on inflows outflows and available storage such that the change in stage does not exceed the user specified change in stage tolerance which is typically set such that the mass balance error is minimal the time steps are rounded down to the closest time step level following which a pass is made through the entire network beginning at nodes with the lowest time step level to ensure that the neighboring nodes do not increase more than one time step level for example if a total of ten 10 time step levels are chosen the inner most level with the smallest time step will be calculated 512 times compared to the outer most level with the largest time step but the neighboring cells do not increase by more than one level once all cells on all time step levels are calculated the maximum allowable time steps for all the nodes are re evaluated and the process is repeated a finite element time marching scheme is used for the groundwater model based on a quadratic shape function the algorithm solves for heads at every node triangle vertex and midpoint in the computational mesh in this study the hydraulic routing time interval is set between 0 01 and 5 12 s ten time steps the hydrology is updated after every 300 s 5 min and the groundwater flows seepages and recharge rates are calculated at every hour 3600 s 4 methodology the overall goal of this study is to show that an integrated sw gw modeling approach provides more robust and accurate results compared to the conventional surface water modeling approach this goal is accomplished by creating three modeling configurations fig 4 by gradually increasing physical complexity to show the relative improvement in the model results more details on these configurations including the steps involved in creating them are provided below 4 1 creation of icpr model configurations 4 1 1 surface model discretization c1 the c1 model represents a 2d surface water model which uses gage data at upstream usgs stations and routes the water solely based on topographic variation and roughness characteristics this configuration represents the default conventional approach to flood modeling driven by upstream discharge hydrograph the elevation data for this model is obtained from the gridded 9 m resolution lidar the river geometry for this configuration is defined using a flexible triangular mesh such that it is dense in the channel and its floodplain as shown in fig 3 and coarse for the land surface away from the river to reduce computation time this flexible mesh structure ensures that the mass balance is simulated accurately where most of the water transport is taking place the triangular mesh in icpr is overlain on the lidar dem and the elevation of lidar cell directly intersecting with a specific triangular vertex is extracted and assigned to the vertex the flow hydrodynamics is simulated by using a 2d overland flow routing that is based on the solution of diffusive wave formulations appendix a eqs a 8 a 10 additionally c1 does not require any additional hydrologic inputs e g rainfall since it has no subsurface connectivity and is based solely on the traditional hydraulic routing techniques used for estimating flood depths and extent of inundation basically the ground surface is assumed to be impervious for c1 and the streamflow from eight upstream gages are routed without any rainfall thereby representing a configuration that is synonymous to the traditional 2d surface water routing models such as hec ras 2d and lisflood fp this triangular mesh for the 2d overland flow region is generated using the breakline and breakpoint feature in icpr the breakline feature is a polyline shapefile generated by digitizing the river channels in the study area using aerial imagery and lidar data each point used to create the polyline breakline feature is assigned a triangular vertex node in icpr and the triangle edges are formed along the polyline therefore the channel flow rates are computed along the triangle edges within the icpr computational scheme since more points are required to digitize river bends the resultant mesh is denser along the river bends and at confluences since the dem resolution for the lidar data is 9 m the breakline feature is digitized such that the minimum distance between any two vertices is 9 m and the maximum edge length along straight channels is 27 m therefore the average triangular edge length in the river channels is 15 m for mesh digitization outside the river channels the breakpoint feature which is a point shapefile is used for mesh generation every point in the breakpoint shapefile is assigned a triangular vertex in the mesh and these features can be automatically generated in icpr at a specified distance for more information on breakpoints and breaklines please refer to streamline technologies 2018 using this principle triangular breakpoint patterns with an average edge length of 60 m and 300 m are assigned inside and outside the floodplain respectively 4 1 2 subsurface model discretization c2 and c3 the overland flow in c1 configuration is modified to include two subsurface configurations in the first modification referred to as c2 the overland flow can only interact with the unsaturated soil layer vadose zone with a static wt the vadose zone thickness is determined using gssurgo data for the region which remains constant throughout the simulation the c2 configuration is like other commonly used hydrologic models such as hec hms and swat that route the rainfall excess surface flow and the water percolating beyond the vadose zone is lost as aquifer recharge the initial soil moisture in the vadose zone is assumed to be equivalent to field capacity at the beginning of the simulation as mentioned in section 3 2 the water movement in the vadose zone and subsequent gw recharge is computed using the refined green ampt method streamline technologies 2018 a total of twenty five cells are used for the vadose zone in this study initially all the cells start with the same parameters as shown in table 2 but the moisture content across each cell can vary with time as the fluxes through each individual cell are tracked in both upward and downward directions during the simulation at each time step the wetting front moves through individual unsaturated cells which are wetted or dried using the available soil storage and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity fig 4 provides an illustration of the vadose zone discretized into multiple cells which are used to redistribute the soil moisture in the third configuration referred to as c3 the wt in c2 is made dynamic so the water that percolates beyond the vadose zone is used to increase the storage in the surficial aquifer which results in the rise of the wt similarly during dry conditions the wt recedes and increases the vadose zone depth along with vertical movement of the wt c3 also incorporates gw contributions from horizontal gradients causing seepage fronts that discharge into the wabash river within the subsurface in c3 the gw recharge rates from the vadose zone for a given wt elevation are converted to a volume which is based on the hydrological computational time increments this volume in turn determines the change in the wt elevation for the next time increment to simulate the gw dynamics in c3 an initial wt surface is required at the beginning of the simulation to generate this surface first the wt depth contours obtained from idnr s potentiometric surface maps are interpolated using the inverse distance weighting idw method to form a wt depth raster at a spatial resolution of 30 m second this wt depth raster is subtracted from the ground lidar resampled to 30 m to obtain a wt elevation surface third this surface is imported into an initial version of the c3 model which is then simulated at steady state for one month using the daily average streamflow for the streams in the watershed finally it is assumed that the wt surface reaches equilibrium at the end of this steady state simulation the wt surface obtained at the end of the steady state simulation is used as the initial wt surface for the c3 model used in this study within the surficial aquifer the gw flow is calculated using the 2d unsteady phreatic solution of the continuity equation using a finite element formulation more specifically a six point triangular element is used with a quadratic interpolation function and the system of equations is solved using the cholesky method kuiper 1981 martínez 1989 a 2d subsurface discretization also allows c3 to account for the non uniform distribution of the hydraulic properties in the vadose zone and surficial aquifer kollet and maxwell 2006 since the gw processes operate at larger spatial scales compared to sw processes bloschl and sivapalan 1995 wood et al 1988 a coarser resolution mesh with an average edge length of 45 m in the channel 240 m in the floodplain and 900 m outside the floodplain is created a detailed description of the modification of the continuity equation for finite element formulation is described in appendix b and can also be accessed from icpr s technical reference manual streamline technologies 2018 table 2 presents the uncalibrated green ampt parameters used for c2 and c3 and surficial aquifer parameters used for c3 that are classified based on soil zones and the type of aquifer system respectively the gssurgo database contains spatially distributed hydrologic soil group classification based on runoff potential and the four soil zones used in this study are based on this classification the saturated vertical conductivity moisture content at field capacity and at wilting point presented in table 2 reflect the median values of the specific soil zones in the gssurgo database the other parameters require information on the soil texture percentages which are also available from the gssurgo database using the soil texture percentages and the equations provided in rawls 2004 the other subsurface parameters such as pore size index soil matric potential and residual moisture content are evaluated streamline technologies 2018 for the gw zones the map of the spatial distribution of different unconsolidated aquifer systems for indiana is available from igic s indiana map server http maps indiana edu index html the aquifer properties for wabash valley are obtained from a study on the investigation of groundwater resources in indiana pohlmann 1987 4 2 model simulations using three configurations the three configurations are run in an unsteady state to simulate hourly streamflow stage and extent of inundation for a month from april 11th 2013 to may 10th 2013 during this period multiple rainfall events of varying magnitude were observed in indiana that resulted in a peak streamflow corresponding to a 50 year return period in the wabash river at lafayette the first 5 days of simulation are used for model initialization which is completed when all the models reach equilibrium and all reaches are connected the equilibrium is reached when the mass balance error in the system stabilizes to a value less than 1 the outputs from the three model configurations are compared with observed data for the next 25 days at the watershed outlet a period of 25 days is chosen to simulate both high and low flow conditions that occurred during and after the storm event respectively evapotranspiration is not included in c2 and c3 during the one month simulation based on the assumption that the effect of et would be negligible during a short and extremely wet period the input parameters are kept unchanged for different model configurations because the goal is to investigate the sensitivity of flood simulation from the three configurations to subsurface flow integration under normal climatic conditions it should also be noted that the model comparisons are based on uncalibrated parameter inputs because calibration can result in unrealistic representation of relative contributions from the overland and subsurface processes due to the existence of equifinality pappenberger et al 2005 beven 1993 after applying the three models to simulate the one month period the streamflow stage and extent of inundation are evaluated and compared between models the stage is evaluated by subtracting the channel bed elevation at the gage from the wse the stage is used instead of wse as wse is a scale dependent parameter which can create bias in the results due to the elevation or altitude of the location the relative performance of these models is also evaluated by comparing the simulated results with observed data 4 3 statistical comparison of model configurations in order to evaluate the goodness of fit between the three configurations and observed data the coefficient of determination r2 is calculated while r2 is used as a measure of linear trend the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 which reflects the overall fit of a hydrograph is also evaluated similarly the slope parameter which provides a measure of overprediction or underprediction of model outputs with increasing magnitude is evaluated in addition percent bias pbias sorooshian et al 1993 a statistic used to measure if the average tendency of simulated data is larger or smaller than observed data is also calculated gupta et al 1999 finally the rmse observations standard deviation ratio rsr which is a scaled normalized parameter is evaluated to estimate the variation in model residuals 4 4 spatial aggregation and computational performance of model configurations as mentioned in section 3 the icpr model uses a flexible spatiotemporal structure for the surface and gw regions the application of flexible resolution spatial mesh and variable hydraulic time steps 0 01 to 5 12 s significantly improves the computational efficiency of these models for large watersheds table 3 presents the spatial aggregation parameters of the surface and gw meshes provided in parenthesis for c3 generated for the uwr basin fig 3 since the same surface mesh is used for the three configurations the number of triangles and the mean triangular area is the same to compare the spatial resolution of triangulated irregular networks tins with gridded dems vivoni et al 2005 used two spatial aggregation parameters the horizontal point density d and the equivalent cell size r e which can be evaluated using eqs 1 and 2 1 d n t n g 2 r e a n t where d horizontal point density n t number of triangular nodes or vertices n g number of dem nodes r e equivalent cell size or length scale and a basin area the number of dem nodes n g are evaluated using the 9 m lidar for the surface region and the 30 m initial wt raster for the gw region the r e values for the surface 156 m and gw 428 m meshes represent the equivalent spatial resolution of the tins used in this study similarly the d values provide a ratio of the number of computational elements used in the surface 0 003 and gw 0 004 meshes in comparison to the fixed resolution gridded dems the models used in this study are simulated on a 4 core intel i 7 system with a processing speed of 3 7 ghz the build process involves generation of the meshes required for simulation intersection of all input datasets to extract model parameters and assignment of nomenclature to mesh nodes and vertices as shown in table 3 the build and simulation times for c1 and c2 are very similar as the hydrodynamic processes control the total simulation time for both configurations the build and simulation times for c3 are 120 and 60 longer than c1 although c3 requires a longer computational time the computational efficiency of c3 can be increased significantly by increasing the number of simulation cores as the sw and gw regions can be parallelized in icpr even without parallelization a one month simulation can be completed in approximately one day highlighting the overall computational efficiency of the flexible spatiotemporal structure used in this study 5 results and discussion the results are presented in four parts i comparison of the three model configurations c1 c2 and c3 ii quantification of the relative contribution of watershed processes during flooding iii evaluating the effect of antecedent soil conditions on flood outputs and iv further validation of results by applying c3 under different flow and watershed conditions 5 1 comparison of the three model configurations 5 1 1 comparison of model outputs with observed data in this section the observed streamflow and stage is compared with the simulated streamflow and stage for c1 c2 and c3 respectively it should be noted that all the models begin from the same initial surface storage and c1 does not have any infiltration into the soil column the results presented in fig 5 a show that c1 overpredicts the streamflow significantly near the peak and underpredicts during low flows this result suggests that the surface water models produce higher outflow during flood events as the water flowing into the surface system inflow is fully recovered as either surface storage or outflow since the inflow volume in c1 is not removed from the surface system due to the absence of processes like infiltration evapotranspiration gw seepage and recharge the resulting outflow volumes are higher for c1 on the other hand c2 severely underpredicts the streamflow during low flow conditions but predicts the peak streamflow accurately when compared to observed data while a portion of the infiltrated water is stored in the vadose zone and some is delivered to the surface as excess runoff in c2 most of the water exits the system by percolating out of the vadose zone and is lost as subsurface recharge resulting in an underprediction in c2 due to a better physical process representation c3 performs well in predicting the streamflow for the entire duration of the simulation fig 5b suggests that c1 fails to predict the stage accurately for the duration of the simulation in comparison to streamflow the error in estimating stage for all models is less severe near the hydrograph peak because the stage is more resistant to fluctuations in streamflow when the water inundates outside the main channel and into the floodplain causing a significant increase in the flow area additionally a change in streamflow can also affect the flow velocities resulting in a less severe impact on stage the scatterplots about the line y x shown in fig 5c and d further highlight the overall accuracy of c3 in estimating streamflow and stage the streamflow and stage hydrographs for the three configurations highlight the importance of including a dynamic wt and a variable vadose zone thickness in the context of streamflow generation current hydrologic models such as hec hms and swat are severely limited in considering this dynamic nature to improve the prediction using such models the parameters need to be calibrated to produce a best fit combination of parameters arnold et al 2012 zhang et al 2013 however this process of calibration does not guarantee model performance during different hydrologic and climatic conditions liew et al 2005 schuol and abbaspour 2006 assuming a fixed vadose zone thickness can also restrict the maximum volume of water available to plants in the root zone which in turn may influence other processes such as evapotranspiration which is a dominant variable during normal climatic conditions here c2 represents hydrologic models that do not account for groundwater movement and therefore underpredicts the streamflow and stage c3 includes a dynamic wt along with the surficial aquifer characterization which significantly improves the prediction the c3 outflows suggest that the total amount of water infiltrating into the subsurface reduces on inclusion of a dynamic wt additionally a fraction of the water is also recovered from the subsurface in the form of seepage due to the direct interaction of the wt with the surface which contributes towards a more accurate low flow estimation even though c2 has a better physical process representation than c1 its performance is worse than c1 as shown in table 4 and fig 5 these results suggest that a fixed vadose zone model that permits water percolation into an infinite gw region without properly quantifying recharge and wt location performs worse than simply using a model with an impervious surface c1 to improve the performance of models like c2 it may be more beneficial to restrict the percolation out of the unsaturated zone by assuming an impervious bottom soil layer thereby providing a fixed storage in the soil system this modification can reduce the underprediction in c2 as it may improve the simulation of hortonian runoff infiltration excess even though dunne runoff saturation excess may not be simulated accurately without proper conceptualization of gw processes xie et al 2003 for events that are primarily affected by hortonian runoff the error induced by excluding gw processes may be offset by incorporating an unsaturated zone without gw recharge however several factors can result in hortonian runoff dominated events across watersheds for example the spatial heterogeneity in soil properties antecedent soil conditions watershed topography and rainfall intensity therefore before choosing a model configuration like c2 these factors should be considered otherwise the results may not be accurate without gw incorporation as shown in this study fig 6 shows the wse and top width for the three configurations at a cross section just upstream of the outlet the results from c2 suggest that there is no inundation in the floodplain and the water remains inside the main channel for the lowest flow however both c1 and c3 suggest inundated floodplains near the outlet the top width and wse at low flows are similar for both c1 and c3 the top width across the channel for peak flow is highest for c1 whereas the difference between c2 and c3 is not as appreciable when compared to low flows a higher top width for c1 during peak flow is representative of higher outflow volumes as shown in fig 5a and a smaller top width during low flows is indicative of the underprediction by c2 fig 7 presents the flood inundation maps near the wabash tippecanoe confluence for the highest peak and lowest streamflow during the simulation the difference in the location and magnitude of inundation between the three models is evident from the flood maps at peak streamflow fig 7a c for c2 the inundation area measured at both peak and lowest streamflow is significantly lower fig 7b and e than c1 and c3 as shown in table 4 the peak flow flood inundation area is smallest for c2 155 1 km2 followed by c1 171 4 km2 and c3 188 2 km2 overall c3 has the highest flood inundation extent since it accounts for surface ponding during extreme rainfall as the subsurface becomes saturated additionally water seeping laterally from the rivers into the subsurface can seep out elsewhere causing ponding therefore c3 can capture river floodplain interactions across both the surface and subsurface regions in contrast c1 only shows inundation due to riverine flow that inundates into the floodplain and hence the flooding is localized around the river channel the flood inundation area corresponding to the lowest flow for c1 119 4 km2 and c3 118 9 km2 are approximately equal which suggests the traditional surface water routing approach and the integrated approach produce similar results during low flows when the water remains inside the river channels the results presented in this section suggest that the overall model performance for c3 is superior when compared to c1 and c2 however the extent of inundation does not depend only on streamflow and stage but also on the accuracy of topographic data in this study the extent of inundation estimated by the model configurations is not compared with observed flood inundation and therefore it is essential to note that the flood inundation maps presented here only provide a relative difference between the model configurations from a watershed perspective if the inflow and outflow from the watershed is predicted accurately the extent of inundation will be a function of the resolution and vertical accuracy of topographic data 5 1 2 statistical comparison of model performance fig 5 suggests that c3 performs best when compared to observed flow however it is essential to evaluate model performance statistics to further validate these conclusions table 5 presents the statistical parameters for evaluating goodness of fit between the three models and observed data the statistical performance of the models in estimating streamflow suggests that c3 r2 0 95 performs best followed by c1 r2 0 85 and c2 r2 0 80 as mentioned earlier the stage is evaluated by subtracting the bed elevation from the wse at the outlet the model performance in estimating stage suggests that c3 has a high r2 value of 0 95 but both c1 and c2 have a diminished performance with r2 values of 0 81 and 0 78 respectively a very low nse for c2 in estimating streamflow and stage indicates an unacceptable performance moriasi et al 2007 even though c1 and c3 have comparable r2 values high nse values of 0 94 and 0 93 in estimating streamflow and stage clearly suggest that c3 has a very good performance when compared to observed data based on the model evaluation guidelines by moriasi et al 2007 while both c1 and c3 underpredict the rising limb of the hydrograph the overall slope in comparison to the line y x is close to 1 which indicates that neither of the models are consistently overpredicting or underpredicting the streamflow overall c3 performs better statistically in estimating streamflow highlighted by a lower pbias 6 0 compared to c1 8 6 similarly c3 also has a better performance in estimating stage as shown by a very low pbias 3 2 compared to c1 6 6 and c2 22 4 a low slope 0 77 for c2 indicates that the model underpredicts the streamflow consistently even though the relative error in peak streamflow table 4 is very small 2 2 in addition c3 has a lower rsr when compared to c1 and c2 which further highlights the improvement in model performance due to an accurate representation of physical processes since an inaccurate mesh resolution can cause mass balance errors in the model the performance of the three configurations is tested for two additional mesh resolutions including one that is coarser and another that is finer than the one presented in this study the overall conclusions did not change but the degree of improvement compared to the observed data was different when using a coarser mesh resolution for example the reported r2 values when using a coarser mesh resolution for c1 c2 and c3 are 0 59 0 76 and 0 85 respectively and therefore the integrated model performed better regardless of the mesh resolution using the mesh resolution finer than the one used in this study did not provide any additional improvement in the results for any configurations 5 2 quantification of the relative contribution of watershed processes the results in the previous section signify the importance of integrating rainfall and subsurface flow with surface water models for production of flood inundation maps c3 is uncalibrated and yet the performance statistics suggest that this model predicts both the streamflow and stage accurately for the simulation period in addition to reducing calibration uncertainty it is also essential to quantify the contributions from different watershed processes during flood events this analysis can help in highlighting which process plays a dominant role in exacerbating or attenuating the flood responses to quantify the relative contribution of different processes during a storm event the volumetric contributions from hydraulic routing vadose zone and gw recharge are evaluated for c3 since estimating the exact flow paths for gw flow regimes is beyond the scope of this study and is less relevant in the context of flood prediction the volumetric contribution divided by the watershed area mm is used as a metric for quantifying the relative contributions from different physical processes fig 8 a presents the streamflow hydrograph for c3 which is used as a metric to evaluate the volume of water leaving the watershed through the surface fig 8b shows the stream inflow which is the cumulative volumetric inflow into the model from all eight upstream usgs gage stations for c3 and the stream outflow which is the cumulative volume of water discharging or leaving the system from the model outlet which is located at usgs gage 03335500 wabash river at lafayette fig 8b also presents δsurface storage which provides a cumulative estimate of the increase or decrease in the surface water volume in the river floodplain system for the entire watershed when flood responses are mapped without rainfall and subsurface integration for example c1 the difference in stream inflow and stream outflow should represent the change in surface water inundation for the watershed for c3 on the other hand the δsurface storage is also a function of rainfall excess and gw seepage fig 8c shows precipitation which is the cumulative rainfall for the entire drainage area during the entire simulation period the rainfall excess shown in fig 8c represents the hourly excess rainfall volume which is delivered to the surface as runoff from the vadose zone after evaluating infiltration and initial abstraction losses therefore this represents the volume of runoff per hour that causes surficial ponding and subsequent inundation the gw recharge shown in fig 8d represents the volume of water removed from the vadose zone due to downward percolation which is delivered to the groundwater system as recharge in addition when the wt rises and intercepts the surface the water is discharged to the surface system as lateral seepage shown in fig 8d therefore both rainfall excess and lateral seepage contribute additional volume to the surface system during flood events thereby resulting in increased flood inundation which is highlighted in table 4 and fig 7 the hydrograph in fig 8a highlights that c3 can capture streamflow variability throughout the simulation on the other hand in addition to the overprediction near the hydrograph peak c1 underpredicts streamflow after a simulation time of 220 h as highlighted in fig 5a as shown in fig 8d the subsurface storage increases significantly during peak rainfall intensity which accounts for reduction in overall surface storage thereby producing a more accurate streamflow prediction during high flow conditions after the rainfall event the vadose zone storage recedes resulting in more gw recharge this increase in potentiometric head in the surficial aquifer causes increased lateral seepage fig 8d from the subsurface into the river system this lateral seepage volume results in a more accurate streamflow prediction during low flow conditions for c3 after 400 h as shown in fig 8a when compared to c1 which does not capture the increased streamflow due to gw seepage therefore subsurface processes influence both the streamflow and the surface water inundation throughout the simulation these results further highlight the shortcomings of the current surface water models that route the streamflow solely based on roughness coefficients while c1 overestimates the streamflow for this watershed the absence of subsurface processes can lead to an underprediction of streamflow in gw dominated watersheds to rectify this overprediction underprediction in streamflow modelers calibrate the roughness coefficients for decreasing increasing the flow velocities thereby changing the volume of water intercepted in the surface system this practice of calibrating often improves the model results for specific events however without a true representation of the streamflow attenuation or amplification caused by subsurface processes these models can produce erroneous flood estimates for other events moore and doherty 2005 5 3 evaluating the effect of antecedent soil conditions on flood outputs the results from the previous sections highlight the influence of subsurface processes on flood responses the analysis in this section aims to evaluate the potential of existing vadose zone moisture content and wt location in controlling surface water inundation and streamflow generation therefore only the subsurface component of c3 is modified in this step the hypothesis is that the wt location determines the control of groundwater in redistributing soil moisture upwards in the vadose zone which further impacts the land surface inundation three soil moisture scenarios are used to represent dry moderate and wet conditions for the dry scenario d the initial soil moisture in the vadose zone is near wilting point and the average depth of wt is approximately 6 m floods occurring during this scenario are synonymous to heavy rainfall occurring when dry conditions have existed for a long time before the event similarly for the wet scenario w the vadose zone is very shallow depth to wt 0 5 m and the degree of saturation in the vadose zone ranges between 0 90 and 0 95 therefore even a small amount of percolation can saturate the vadose zone as the initial soil moisture is very close to the porosity flooding in this scenario is synonymous to two extreme rainfall events occurring one after the other the moderate scenario m represents the case where the soil moisture is at field capacity and the wt is at an intermediate depth of 1 5 m from the surface which also represents the nrcs s average vadose zone depth of 150 cm the initial stage surface is imported from c3 using the stage outputs just before the 50 year storm event the three scenarios d w and m are run in an unsteady state to simulate hourly flood inundation and streamflow outputs for the storm event and the comparisons are used to analyze the influence of existing subsurface conditions on flooding the results in table 6 suggest that there is a significant difference in both the streamflow outputs and inundation area obtained using the three scenarios the m scenario is considered as the base model to evaluate the relative difference when dry and wet conditions exist table 6 also shows that there is a 10 8 increase and a 3 7 decrease in peak streamflow for w and d respectively in addition the flood inundation area obtained using d is less severe 12 2 due to completely dry subsurface conditions and more severe 40 5 due to completely saturated subsurface conditions for w as shown in fig 9 for the same amount of precipitation the cumulative change in vadose zone storage fig 9c is highest for d followed by m and lowest for w since w has a nearly saturated vadose zone a larger portion of the rainfall is redistributed to the surface as excess rainfall which directly affects the peak inundation area table 6 additionally this also results in significantly higher gw recharge volumes throughout the simulation for w therefore when the subsurface is saturated the peak streamflow cumulative outflow volume and gw recharge increase substantially the flood inundation maps presented in fig 9e g represent the extent of inundation across the three configurations at the exact instance of time when the peak streamflow is observed at the outlet the flood inundation map shown in fig 9g suggests that the extent of inundation at peak streamflow also increases when saturated conditions w exist as there is no infiltration into the subsurface in addition to higher gw contributions due to lateral seepage when the wt interacts with the surface it should be noted that these instantaneous maps do not show the maximum inundation in the watershed during the simulation period which can even occur before or after the peak streamflow is observed as shown in table 6 there is only a 3 7 difference in the peak streamflow for the dry and moderate conditions therefore when the peak streamflow is observed there is very small difference in the extent of inundation between the dry and moderate configurations as shown in fig 9e and f however table 6 suggests that there is an overall difference of 12 2 in the maximum inundation area between the two configurations suggesting that the maximum inundation at specific locations may have occurred at different times the results validate the hypothesis that the location of the wt and existing soil moisture influence the overall flood inundation outputs the hypothetical phenomenon presented here using the w scenario highlights the potential of a fully saturated subsurface in increasing flood risk which was observed during both hurricane frances and hurricane matthew weaver et al 2016 generally floods corresponding to a specific return period have a standard map with a fixed extent of inundation for example 100 year firms however due to existing saturated conditions flooding from a 100 year flood event can be more severe than anticipated therefore static flood maps should also be created based on antecedent soil moisture conditions as well as the wt location for coastal aquifers that are prone to hurricane induced rainfall containing a shallow wt and a higher antecedent soil moisture these flood maps should be re evaluated using integrated models so that the true flood risk can be estimated 5 4 further validation of c3 model the results from the previous sections highlight the advantage of integrating hydraulic and hydrologic processes for simulating flood responses to validate these findings and further analyze the difference in the existing flood modeling approach c1 and the integrated modeling approach c3 two models for the uwr basin referred to as c1 uwr and c3 uwr are simulated for a long continuous three month period from february 15th to may 15th 2018 using the same model parameters the first two days are used as warm up period and the results are compared against observed data at the outlet wabash river at lafayette from february 17th to may 15th 2018 the results shown in fig 10 and table 7 clearly highlight the advantage of using an integrated modeling approach for flood prediction the hydrograph in fig 10c highlights that c3 uwr can capture streamflow variability throughout the simulation which can be seen from the superior nse 0 97 pbias 4 2 and peak flow error 5 3 on the other hand c1 uwr fig 10a overpredicts the streamflow for high and moderate flows throughout the simulation which is highlighted by the nse 0 92 pbias 12 1 and peak flow error 14 9 additionally the results from figs 5 and 10 suggest that both c1 and c3 can capture the low flows accurately the accurate performance of c1 during low flows in streamflow dominated streams like the wabash river highlights its applicability in conditions where the water remains inside the river channel and the volume of water exchanged between the river and subsurface is insignificant in comparison to streamflow finally the results also validate the applicability of the refined green ampt method used in this study for continuous simulations to warrant a broader applicability of the integrated modeling approach the c1 and c3 configurations are also tested for another watershed with significantly different physical characteristics from the uwr basin therefore the east branch croton river cr basin with a drainage area of 210 km2 situated in the state of new york usa is chosen as an additional validation site as shown in fig 11 the land use for the cr basin is characterized by 56 forest cover 23 developed 11 agriculture and 10 water on the other hand the land use for the uwr basin comprises of 7 forest 9 developed 82 agriculture and 2 water table 1 highlighting the difference in the physical characteristics between the two watersheds additionally unlike the wabash river which is channel flow dominated the croton river is a rainfall runoff dominated stream surrounded by wetlands the outlet of the cr basin is located at the usgs gage 01374505 east branch croton river at brewster ny as shown in fig 11 to aid a more extensive validation the performance of c1 and c3 is also compared against observed data inside the watershed at an additional usgs gage 0137449480 east branch croton river near putnam lake ny using the same modeling approach as the uwr basin two models for the cr basin referred as c1 cr and c3 cr are simulated for a continuous seven month period from march 1st to september 30th 2011 to provide a longer time for incorporating antecedent conditions in the integrated model the first two months are used as warm up period and the results are compared with the observed data from may 1st to september 30th 2011 the results fig 12 highlight the inability of c1 cr to capture streamflow variability in small rainfall runoff dominated catchments especially for low flows as shown in fig 12c and table 7 c1 cr overpredicts both the high and low flows at brewster nse 0 18 pbias 86 3 and error peak flow 23 4 it is evident from fig 12d that c3 cr nse 0 85 pbias 4 2 and error peak flow 21 1 has a superior performance compared to c1 cr the difference in the performance between the two configurations becomes wider during long term continuous simulations especially for small rainfall events a possible explanation for this difference is the shallow channel conveyance and existence of wetlands around the croton river which can cause higher river floodplain interactions even during low flows resulting in streamflow attenuation during small events which is evident from fig 12b and d when considering only the high flows which are more relevant to flood modeling the performance of c1 cr is comparable to c3 cr at brewster the difference in performance is also observed at putnam inside the watershed where c1 cr nse 0 50 pbias 64 8 and error peak flow 41 6 overpredicts the streamflow fig 12a during the continuous simulation and c3 cr nse 0 95 pbias 6 1 and error peak flow 12 1 captures the hydrograph variability including the peak flows more accurately fig 12b the results from fig 12 and table 7 highlight the broader applicability of the integrated modeling approach c3 for watershed with distinct physical characteristics as highlighted in section 5 3 incorporating accurate antecedent conditions is highly essential in improving the predictive capacity of integrated models this is also evident from the accurate performance of c3 cr for which a sufficiently long warm up period is chosen 2 months to incorporate antecedent conditions more accurately therefore during event scale flood modeling the rainfall distribution and streamflow patterns prior to the event should be carefully analyzed and saturated dry or moderate soil moisture distribution should be used for characterizing initial conditions depending on the hydrologic time series preceding the flood events being simulated while the performance of c3 is superior to c1 in both watersheds this does not necessarily mean that the integrated models will obviously outperform the overland flow flood models across all watersheds since the physical processes involved in hydraulic and hydrologic modeling are scale dependent the application of integrated modeling may not achieve significant improvements compared to using simpler surface water transport models at small spatial scales for channel flow dominated streams when the influence of rainfall and subsurface processes is diminished 6 summary and conclusions generally hydrologic models are calibrated for streamflow while hydraulic models are calibrated for stage and extent of inundation however these three variables streamflow stage and extent of inundation are linked together and are a function of multiple variables including topography rainfall soil type land use subsurface storage and evapotranspiration this study highlights the discrepancies in simulating the river hydrodynamics when some of the underlying processes are not incorporated in the model specifically the results from this study highlight the advantages of using integrated sw gw models in simulating flood hydrodynamics the following conclusions are drawn from this study 1 a comparison of the model configurations shows that c1 produces the highest outflow volume since the change in storage is only dependent on topographic gradients and surface roughness while c2 produces the smallest outflow volume since the water percolating below the vadose zone is lost from the water balance the existence of dynamic wt in c3 reduces the water lost from the system and therefore the outflow volume is higher than c2 overall c3 produces the highest nse and lowest pbias in estimating streamflow and stage compared to observed data 2 looking at only the impact of streamflow in affecting the extent of inundation the results from this study hint at an underprediction of the extent of inundation by using the conventional surface water modeling approach c1 or c2 compared to c3 however in the absence of observed extent of inundation this conclusion needs further evaluation 3 most hydraulic models are calibrated by modifying the roughness coefficients but the results from this study show that an incorporation of the sw gw dynamics within the river system c3 can improve the performance of models in estimating streamflow and stage without any extensive calibration this reinforces the notion that the dynamic river stage should be simulated by including sw gw interactions in the model instead of only calibrating the roughness coefficient 4 the existing wt location and antecedent soil moisture conditions can have a significant impact on the streamflow stage and flood inundation area the results suggest that saturated subsurface conditions w can severely increase the inundation area on the other hand dry subsurface conditions d can reduce the overall impact of flood events incorporating accurate antecedent conditions is essential for predicting flood responses accurately and therefore adequate warm up period should be chosen for integrated models depending on the spatial scale of the watershed and temporal scale of simulations 5 the validation of c3 for an independent continuous 3 month simulation for the uwr basin and for a 5 month simulation for the cr basin with different physical characteristics highlights the broad applicability of the integrated modeling approach although the results from this study are promising and the modeling approach proposed here is relatively more comprehensive some of the modeling components can be further improved to enhance the findings for example this study incorporates soil redistribution in the vadose zone using vertically homogeneous soil zones where the soil moisture and subsequent gw recharge is computed using a non iterative kinematic approach and hence the integrated models do not incorporate lateral flows in the vadose zone this assumption works well for large flood events with a high intensity of rainfall as the soil moisture profile closely resembles a sharp wetting front cylinder however infiltration does not occur cylindrically instead percolates through the soil system in three dimensions lateral flows can not only influence the volume and location of gw recharge but also the magnitude of streamflow although the residence time may be large hughes 2010 this study assumes that the vertical percolation dominates during the simulation period which may not be true during low flow conditions or in other watersheds for a more realistic estimation of the soil moisture redistribution during continuous simulations numerical solution of the 3d richards equation using finite element formulations can be used however obtaining adequate data to parameterize a 3d model of unsaturated low is very difficult additionally when dealing with large watersheds representing the vadose zone using the 3d form of richard s equation becomes computationally expensive and impractical for the purpose of flood modeling in this regard models such as parflow and hydrogeosphere which offer a fully integrated 3d solution of unsaturated and saturated subsurface flow aided by high performance computing can be incorporated in future studies brunner and simmons 2012 kollet and maxwell 2006 finally the effect of preferential flows is also neglected in this study preferential flow through macropores can bypass the entire unsaturated soil column and accelerate the transport of water into the streams alaoui et al 2011 therefore preferential flow through the soil matrix should be incorporated in regions where the soil properties are conducive for its existence although obtaining accurate data to characterize the preferential flow paths is very challenging it should be noted that the antecedent initial soil conditions are chosen at field capacity for all simulations of the integrated c3 model this is done as the exact soil moisture distribution is unknown at the beginning of the simulation similarly the initial wt surface used in c3 is generated by simulating steady state conditions for one month and assuming that the wt surface is in equilibrium further this study uses contour maps for calculating the initial wt depths but these maps are sparsely distributed and are not available for majority of the watersheds in the world therefore it is possible that the superior performance of the c3 model is influenced by the choice of antecedent soil moisture distribution and the availability of accurate wt information for the uwr basin in indiana in the absence of such information it is necessary to incorporate a substantially long warm up period e g two months for cr basin which can help in balancing the soil moisture profile before the actual event is simulated however this warm up period should be chosen depending on the scale of the watershed magnitude of the event and climatic conditions preceding the event for accurately incorporating the antecedent conditions berthet et al 2009 pathiraja et al 2012 zehe and blöschl 2004 similarly the initial wt location for integrated modeling can be simulated by assuming that the wt is located at a fixed depth below the ground surface e g 2 m for the cr basin followed by a rebalancing of the wt hydraulic heads using a long steady state simulation this method is used to initialize the wt for the c3 cr model and the results presented here support its applicability another alternative to this approach is to start the model simulation during a dry season by assuming completely saturated subsurface conditions wt ground surface and simulating the model for a period of more than three months to let the model obtain equilibrium before the onset of the rainy wet season regardless these methods need to be validated across several other watersheds with different physiological characteristics to justify a broader applicability evapotranspiration is an important physical process that can impact river hydrodynamics and other hydrologic variables in the water cycle especially during continuous simulations of several months one of the limitations of this study is that et is only incorporated in the 7 month simulation of the cr basin section 5 4 as shown in the results the absence of et does not affect the performance of c3 in estimating streamflow and stage for the uwr basin this could be due to the large spatiotemporal scale of rainfall distribution high relative humidity and cloud cover over many days in the simulation period while the impact of et may be less significant for the events in this study the absence of et may result in erroneous estimation of streamflow and stage during other events and at other locations therefore the effect of et should be incorporated in future studies for long term continuous integrated modeling another limitation of this study is the absence of stormwater drainage system in the models especially for croton river basin with a 23 developed area the water discharging into the open channels from the storm drains can influence the magnitude of peak streamflow time of peak and duration of inundation in urban areas however studies on distributed modeling of urban areas have shown that the impact of stormwater drainage in affecting streamflow is diminished during extreme events as the conveyance in the open channels is significantly higher than stormwater drains ogden et al 2011 regardless storm drains can increase flood peaks in the river channels during small to moderate rainfall events and therefore should be included in future studies especially during continuous simulations containing multiple rainfall events while the effect of urban stormwater system is not included in this study the effect of imperviousness in developed regions resulting in reduced infiltration is incorporated in the watersheds used in this study while it may be argued that the integrated model performance is specific to the watersheds used for the analysis the broader goal here is to highlight the reduction in modeling uncertainties when sw gw interactions are incorporated in modeling and mapping the flood inundation watersheds with different physical characteristics react to rainfall events of similar magnitude and intensities differently similarly the groundwater characteristics of the region control the amount of seepage recharge and wt fluctuations therefore the integration of subsurface processes may achieve improvements of different degrees for watersheds depending on the physiographic and hydrogeologic characteristics however even a watershed with a completely different land use classification aquifer characterization and soil classification can be modeled accurately when the physical processes driving the hydrologic variability are incorporated for example a watershed with an urban land use low infiltration capacity and clayey aquifer will undergo diminished sw gw interactions while the gw recharge and vadose zone storage might reduce in such a scenario excess rainfall contributions due to increased impervious cover and reduced infiltration will become more significant and the inability of traditional streamflow driven flood models to account for excess rainfall in the watershed may still result in poor performance alternatively if excess rainfall and infiltration calculations are integrated with channel flow for such watersheds it might yield a more realistic representation of the river floodplain hydrodynamics and therefore the overall flood prediction would be more reliable therefore future studies should incorporate the effect of antecedent atmospheric and subsurface conditions in flood models for more reliable flood determination declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements

thoughtful and constructive feedback appendix a this section provides supplementary information on the overland flow processes including the relevant equations and numerical formulations that are used in this study although icpr includes both one dimensional 1d and two dimensional 2d surface flow 1d flow is not used in this study regardless the basic computational framework for both 1d and 2d surface is based on the node link concept using a finite volume approach that allows for a single fully integrated system of equations to be developed and solved simultaneously therefore the 1d and 2d surface hydraulics do not have to be coupled nodes are specific locations in the modeling domain where wse are calculated links are used to connect and move water from one node to another the surface flows are calculated along the links based on the wse values at the connecting nodes some of the examples of 1d links include pipes weirs channel segments bridges and pump stations the rainfall runoff occurs for basins or catchment areas and runoff from the basins is delivered to the surface nodes although not used in this study the traditional hydrologic methods such as the nrcs unit hydrograph method can also be used in icpr a flexible triangular computational mesh is used for 2d overflow and is generated automatically based on the various graphical features developed by the modeler the vertices of the triangles are treated as nodes and the sides of the triangles become overland flow links the control volumes are formed around the vertices and extend to the midpoints of the triangle sides and to the geometric center of the triangle as shown in fig a 1 a the control volumes become the catchment areas for the rainfall runoff processes the collection of control volumes is referred to as the honeycomb mesh which is intersection with soils and land use maps forming a system of sub polygons see fig a 1 b rainfall is applied to each sub polygon and any water that is does not percolate into the soil is aggregated by the respective control volume and delivered to the corresponding 2d surface node a diamond mesh as depicted in fig a 1 c is simultaneously formed along the

6407,in order to examine temporal patterns and the hydrological cycle of shallow soda pans six pans in hungarian great plain were sampled at monthly intervals over a period of 2 5 years water chemistry and physical parameters temperature ph dissolved oxygen conductivity light water color pt color turbidity phosphorous and nitrogen forms silica alkalinity chloride sulfate content chemical oxygen demand were measured both in the field and laboratory and analyzed using multivariate statistical methods it was possible to distinguish the pans on the basis of water color separating them into two groups g1 consisting of colored pans characterized by low turbidity and high pt color and g2 consisting of turbid pans characterized by high turbidity and low pt color both groups displayed temporal seasonal as well as annual trends and their hydrological cycles followed regular cyclical patterns three hydrological phases filling drying and desiccated were described in the case of the

individual depending on the combined effects of four determining factors climate langbein 1961 geology simon et al 2011 geomorphology williams 2002 and hydrogeology mádl szőnyi and tóth 2009 this type of aquatic ecosystem is found in large numbers and their total volume accounts for about 0 006 of total global water williams 1986 which is very close to that of freshwater 0 007 shiklomanov 1990 williams 1993 inland saline lakes are very diverse in terms of their dominant anions water level fluctuation and depth boros et al 2013 seaman et al 1991 williams 2002 2005 yechieli and wood 2002 in central europe mainly in carpathian basin more than 100 soda pans are to be found these may be defined as follows boros et al 2013 tóth et al 2014 natural soda pans i are shallow depths of between 0 2 and 2 m and astatic ecosystems in which more than 1 3 of the natural origin bed is seasonally covered by open water with surface or pondweed vegetation at least 1 ha in extent ii in periods of total dry out mudflat vegetation appears and the percentage of macrophyte cover does not exceed 50 permanently iii their mean annual salt content is at least 1 g l 1 and dominated by sodium and hydrogen carbonate ions equivalent percentage of a minimum of 25 by ion and iv they have a saline character in terms of their habitats resident species and wildlife communities as a consequence of hydrological features namely their being closed shallow basins these ecosystems are especially vulnerable and their ecological status as well as their very existence is threatened by both climate change and human activities alcocer and escobar 1990 williams 2002 even relatively small fluctuations in the most sensitive areas may result in significant and irreversible changes in their natural characteristics hammer 1990 the effects of climate change on a central european regional scale that is windier winters and calmer summers increasing summer temperatures and decreasing annual precipitation may result in a variety of biotic and abiotic changes in lake ecosystems dokulil 2013 with reference to abiotic changes the decreasing water level and increasing water temperature of the lakes may be assumed to be capable of initiating a cascade of direct and indirect changes in other physical and chemical variables e g increasing salinity different nutrient status etc as a consequence of imbalance in hydrological regimes a reduction in the number of saline lakes and even their disappearance has already been observed worldwide alcocer and escobar 1990 dick et al 1994 as has also been the case with wetland areas mitsch 2013 mitsch and jørgensen 2004 what is more further decrease and decline are predicted williams 2002 saline lakes have a variety of ecological and societal values and functions boros et al 2013 williams 1993 thus their conservation is very important although the hungarian soda pans are located within the territory of national parks and are natura 2000 areas meaning they enjoy ex lege protection in reality the applied conservation management techniques represent a threat to them causing unpredictable changes shifts or reversions in their natural cycles including both biotic and abiotic features lengyel et al 2016 the development of appropriate management plans and tools which are necessarily quite different from those for freshwater ecosystems requires a deep and wide knowledge of both the biotic and abiotic processes in such ecosystems despite the increasing number of studies focusing on soda pans most of them have been designed to study mainly spatial patterns information gathered from numerous pans but generally with only one or two sampling occasions e g boros et al 2014 hecky and kilham 1973 pálffy et al 2014 stenger kovács et al 2014 szabó et al 2017 tóth et al 2014 the study of temporal changes on either the short seasonal or long term annual scales has lagged behind in spite of the astatic nature of soda pans which carries with it the assumption that they are temporally heterogeneous systems studies on seasonal trends of temporary intermittent saline ecosystems are scarce in the literature and may be reduced to a figure of only 14

lengyel et al 2016 and ii key environmental variables e g soluble reactive phosphorus salinity ph playing a determining role in the mentioned communities they have emphasized that these major environmental variables e g salinity are strongly influenced by the hydrological cycle of the lakes and have distinguished two annual phases the filling drying phases however a deep analysis focusing on the temporal trends of the hydrological regime and its relationship with the environmental variables has yet to be written extensive analysis to obtain a better understanding of the dynamics of ecosystems which can support the conservation and maintenance of soda pans is therefore to be considered of urgent importance taking this in to account the present paper had as its aims i the study of the seasonal dynamics of physical and chemical features of soda pans for two and a half hydrological years ii the comparison of the studied pans on the basis of their physical chemical features in order to recognize possible categories and iii the determination and description of the hydrological cycle at a higher resolution in each category what makes present paper both relevant and novel is that the analyses were carried out on a long term dataset and focused on the detailed temporal patterns of soda pans in contrast to other research focusing primarily on spatial patterns and based on only one or two sampling occasions e g boros et al 2014 tóth et al 2014 in this way present research further enhances the knowledge about the hydrological cycle of soda pans which is crucial for understanding ecological processes as well as being crucial to their correct conservation management 2 material and methods 2 1 sampling and sites six natural soda pans of the danube tisza interfluve

ph conductivity and dissolved oxygen were measured in the field using an hq40d hach lange portable multimeter water depth is very difficult to measure due to the intense seiching activity observed in

irradiance resulted in the separation of groups for instance the lowest turbidity mean 225 fnu was measured in sós ér g1 and the highest mean 2123 fnu in zab szék g2 in addition cod pt color nutrients such as tp srp tn and chloride content also played a significant role in the separation of groups whilst do o2 saturation ph temperature and sulfate concentration were the parameters displaying the lowest level of fluctuation and were statistically similar in the pans the most colored pans were bába szék bogárzó and sós ér 1400 pt units these were associated with higher amount of cod and exhibited high degrees of annual fluctuation cv 79 with regard to the n and p forms the total nitrogen tn content was generally low 3 202 mg l 1 and the total phosphorous tp content was high 33 13975 µg l 1 in the pans g1 had a relatively lower and higher numbers of p and n forms respectively while g2 exhibited just the opposite characteristics chloride concentration changed over a broad scale 220 19000 mg l 1 cv 58 169 reaching extreme values in bogárzó 14700 mg l 1 böddi szék 11400 mg l 1 and sós ér 19000 mg l 1 in terms of their ionic composition and its seasonal variation the greater part of the samples 56 86 belonged to the tcarbonate cl type however other types also became characteristic in certain periods altogether five chemical types and subtypes occurred na tcarbonate na tcarbonate cl na cl tcarbonate na cl and na tcarbonate cl so4 2 fig 3 two different ionic types were characteristic of böddi szék kelemen szék and zab szék three types of bába szék four types of bogárzó and sós ér fig 3 over the course of the study period nmds analyses were performed in order to achieve a more refined categorization of the samples within g1 and g2 as the result of the analyses involving only those parameters with a lower degree of variability cv 30 and those deemed most determining by pca water samples could be separated according to hydrological years year 1 and year 2 with little overlap fig 4 a t test resulted in significant differences between the two years for the 11 variables tn cod srp so4 2 co3 2 hco3 cl conductivity pt color turbidity irradiance table 4 in general higher values for the environmental parameters were detected in the first year independently of group g1 g2 with the exception of tn and srp which were statistically higher in the second year since the pca analysis resulted in two groups g1 g2 and the nmds analysis resulted in two additional groups year 1 and year 2 further nmds analyses focusing on temporal trends were performed in these four cases the configurations obtained with the averaged physical and chemical data of the pans and achieved by nmds analyses followed a regular and cyclic pattern fig 5 temporal succession can be easily traced since in most cases they followed each other month after month with slight occasionally marked differences finally the values measured in end of year sample returned to or approached the initial state thus forming a cycle this clearly cyclical nature of the samples was interrupted every year in late autumn and the winter season regardless of whether the pans are colored or turbid nevertheless the pattern of the rupture seemed to be slightly different between the years independently of which group g1 g2 was considered in the first year the samples collected in december displayed a deviation in a positive direction positive aberration from the normal cycle fig 5 in the second year a step back in the negative direction was observed negative aberration in the samples originating from november to january resulting in a break in the cycle fig 5 3 2 hydrological pattern and water cycle besides cyclic and ordered patterns the samples were categorized according to the characteristic hydrological phases in each group and year based on changes in conductivity as the indicator of water level fluctuation an environmental parameter which is the most typical feature of soda pans the samples were categorized into three phases within every hydrological cycle independently of the groups g1 g2 temporal changes in the main environmental parameters are shown as phases in figs 6 and 7 in the first phase of the hydrological cycle the decrease in conductivity representing all ions and nutrients temperature pt color and cod were characteristic reaching a minimum after a couple of months in phase 3 the opposite trend was observed since conductivity temperature and cod continuously increased and reached their maximum values at the end of this phase some differences were observed in g1 and g2 enumerated here 1 with regard to the light and pt color during the phases 1 and 3 opposite trends were characteristic in g1 light intensity was constant in both phases pt color initially decreased then showed an increasing tendency in contrast light intensity displayed decreasing then increasing trends while for pt color there were decreasing and constant trends during the two phases of g2 2 there was a difference between the groups in the number of the phases g2 had two additional phases namely phases 2 and 4 during these phases all parameters except temperature which slightly decreased in phase 2 did not change significantly furthermore an additional difference was found in phase 5 between the groups the pans of g2 did not dry out completely in every year as was the case in those belonging to g1 table 2 4 discussion this study aims to provide a comprehensive temporal characterization of environmental variables for soda pans as highly variable habitats according to the general trend with the increasing distance of the lakes the difference in their water chemical features also increases e g kling et al 2000 but in terms of differences in water chemistry a mosaic pattern emerges as in temporary saline pans in africa and north american freshwater lakes meintjes et al 1994 soranno et al 1999 the geographically close pans had different physical and chemical characteristics these features of soda pans can be derived from four main factors climate geology geomorphology and hydrogeology gibbs 1970 henriksen 1992 since the area of the danube tisza interfluve is too small to have substantially different climatic effects or changes in geology it may be considered homogeneous in this respect i e the study area is located in a geochemical window as defined by mádl szőnyi and tóth 2009 meaning that and the mosaic pattern originates from geomorphological e g distance from the groundwater table and hydrogeological factors e g discharge areas e g mádl szőnyi et al 2008 simon et al 2011 in the hungarian soda pans irradiance alkalinity conductivity and nutrients srp and nitrate were the main environmental parameters as in natural african mexican and spanish shallow saline lakes alcocer and bernal brooks 2002 margalef 1983 oduor and schagerl 2007 talling and talling 1965 the salinity of soda pans is mainly derived from two underlying hydrogeological regimes neogene sediments and pre neogene sediments as described by mádl szőnyi and tóth 2009 tóth and almási 2001 as well as silica content hurley et al 1985 wetzel 2001 high trophic status may result from an elevated amount of guano boros et al 2008b and the closed basin nature of the pans which has the effect of increasing residence time samples were distinguished according to variables related to the optical features of the pans leading to the separation of the colored g1 and turbid g2 pans the main environmental variables displayed a high degree of seasonal variation in relation to the hydrological cycle nutrient content as well as the level of salinity changed with the water level negative scores in srsi were probably caused by the assimilation of silica by diatoms chrysophytes and some aquatic higher plants wetzel 2001 the main environmental parameters exhibited not only seasonal but also annual variation relatively low salinity anion concentration and the enhanced nitrogen and srp concentration in the second year were consequences of the higher amount of precipitation according to the hungarian meteorological service www met hu annual precipitation was approximately 650 740 and 540 mm in 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively which diluted the waters and increased the nutrient level through runoff derived from the surrounding agricultural areas stenger kovács et al 2014 the studied pans can be characterized with different chemical types based on the system defined by boros et al 2014 within individual years accordingly simple categorizations e g based on a single measurement should only be applied with caution since this classification is strongly time dependent the most problematic pan was bába szék where only the 56 of the samples belonged to the na cl tcarbonate type and 44 were distributed between other two chemical types na tcarbonate and na tcarbonate cl type in contrast rather stable conditions were found in sós ér 85 of the samples belonged to na tcarbonate cl type though a further three chemical types can be detected na tcarbonate na cl tcarbonate and na cl type for that reason a reduced time period in april and may is still adequate to sample water and determine the main ions for defining the most significant chemical type of the pans since there was no change in chemical type in this period seasonal patterns in the values of environmental parameters can be distinguished for both the turbid and colored pans in similar ecosystems e g garcía et al 1997 two hydrological phases filling and drying phases are already well known and this is in contrast to the central european soda pans where altogether five hydrological phases phases 1 5 can be distinguished in pans of the turbid type and three phases 1 3 5 in pans of the colored type the reasons for this difference may be morphological and hydrogeological in origin resulting from their different surface areas and the volumes associated with endorheic features leading to different residence times in addition the maintenance of higher water volume and consequently longer water coverage of turbid pans may well result from the water supply from the underlying hydrogeological regimes since subsurface waters can rise up through groundwater raise lens kiss 1979 with regard to kelemen szék a substantial water supply was found during the summer season in particular may to july weidinger et al 2007 colored pans have much smaller water bodies meaning smaller holding capacity faster warming and drying out there is not enough time to sustain phases 2 and 4 the following classification of hydrological cycles for shallow soda pans is proposed and is briefly summarized in table 5 and fig 8 4 1 phase 1 filling phase this is the first phase of the hydrological cycle when as a consequence of the increasing water level most parameters usually start to decrease the beginning of this filling phase approximately coincides with late summer or early autumn after a couple of months the values of the variables reach their minima as a consequence of the high amount of precipitation in this phase the water level increases causing decreasing conductivity nutrient levels and pt color independently of the optical water type turbid or colored pans because of the shallowness of these ecosystems temperature continuously decreases closely following weather conditions is parallel with decreasing dissolved oxygen demand as far as irradiance is concerned the opposite trend is to be observed between the optical water types in turbid pans pt color decreases with increasing water levels associated with the mixing of water by rain or wind resulting in the resuspension of the inorganic content and leading to a low light level in colored pans the underwater light regime is more balanced due to the absence or scarcity of the inorganic component and the negative correlation between the water level and pt color the available light regime is a key environmental factor since it controls many other physical and chemical features such as ph co2 and o2 concentration via its effects on photosynthesis mallin and paerl 1992 furthermore the emergent redox potential of the water has a significant effect on other chemical processes such as nutrient availability wetzel 2001 overall the filling phase can be characterized as having a high degree of fluctuation in environmental variables by the end of this phase for instance conductivity shifts from the hypersaline to the freshwater category hammer 1986 williams 1967 and a light saturated condition changes to light limited besides the changes in the parameters shifts in chemical types also can occur due to the re dissolution of ions but this occurs independently of the totally dried out status as concluded earlier fernández aláez et al 2006 vangenechten et al 1981 environmental parameters change along a steep gradient within a relatively short period even one month which can be crucial for the biota this is partly due to the development of more favorable conditions such as low conductivity which can lead to establishment of diverse aquatic assemblages however a poor light regime in terms of both quantity and quality can exert a further influence on biotic processes falkowski and laroche 1991 kirk 1994 macintyre et al 2002 4 2 phase 2 diluted phase this phase starts after the filling phase at the end of the autumn or early winter and lasts for a few 2 3 months during the diluted phase the pans are characterized by a high water level low conductivity and lacking significant fluctuations in pt color and cod since water turbidity has little effect on light quality spectral composition elevated levels of turbidity mainly cause the reduction of light intensity kirk 1994 depending on variation in local weather variation the temperature may be more or less constantly low or decrease continuously shifts in the chemical types of the water can occur as a result of weather events such as strong precipitation in the form of rain or freezing which has significant abrupt short term effects on physical and chemical characteristics in small water bodies e g weyhenmeyer et al 2004 these weather phenomena are the responsible for the positive and negative aberrations observed in the cyclic hydrological patterns a diluted phase may be characterized by the constancy of the environmental parameters in this phase however low irradiance and temperature may become the key environmental factors determining the distribution of organisms 4 3 phase 3 drying phase around the end of winter or in early spring the values of most environmental parameters start to increase again reaching their maxima towards the end of spring or early summer increasing conductivity temperature and cod are typical of this phase indicating decreases in the amount of change in water level dissolved oxygen concentration and saturation vary according to local conditions such as temperature and water depth the shallower and warmer the water the lower the oxygen concentration generally the pans are well oxygenated but sometimes hypoxia can develop by the end of this phase as the concentration of oxygen drops beneath the lethal oxygen threshold for various organisms less than 2 mg l 1 e g diaz and rosenberg 1995 wetzel 2001 elevated levels of dissolved oxygen were also measured suggesting the presence of significant phytoplankton and picoplankton biomass a phenomenon well known in such habitats e g boros et al 2013 felföldi et al 2009 keresztes et al 2012 pálffy et al 2014 somogyi et al 2014 2017 temperature oxygen concentration and ph have strong effects on nutrient levels goldman and horne 1983 the release rate of phosphorus is highly temperature dependent jensen and andersen 1992 kamp nielsen 1975 søndergaard 1988 1989 low oxygen content can contribute to the redox dependent release of phosphorus boström et al 1982 while elevated ph can promote the availability of p leuven et al 1992 the concentration of phosphorous in this phase seems to have resulted not only from autochthonous sources but also allochthonous processes due to the abundance of waterfowl boros et al 2008a boros et al 2008b temperature and ph affect the available n content and form through the regulation of the nitrification goldman and horne 1983 alkaline conditions ph 9 associated with high temperatures however cause a shift toward nh3 from nh4 resulting in an n limiting environment in spite of the high dissolved oxygen content boros et al 2013 bouldin et al 1974 hopkins and hüner 2004 jones and grant 1999 this nitrogen limited condition is favored by nitrogen fixing algae like aphanizomenon and anabaenopsis ssp one of the dominant algal groups in these ecosystems boros et al 2013 on the other hand nitrification requires a high dissolved oxygen content thus it can contribute to the development of anoxic conditions together with the accumulation of no2 as intermediate product as with the filling phase some differences can be observed between the turbid and colored pans in terms of the light regime and pt color on the basis of the doc water color relationship boros et al 2013 pace and cole 2002 in the absence or scarcity of macrophyte vegetation in this phase the pt color is constant in the turbid pans in a way similar to other shallow ecosystems water level fluctuations generate shifts between clear and turbid water states beklioglu et al 2001 blindow 1992 but in these soda pans this process is independent of the macrophytes this negative correlation can be attributed to two factors i in absence of strong winds in summer inorganic components may settle and ii the smaller the surface of the pans the less effective the mixing power of the wind in contrast the water becomes more brownish in the colored pans due to a greater extend of macrophyte coverage and thus the light regime can remain constant despite the decreasing water level the humic material content represented by pt color has a significant influence on the spectral composition of the light regime due to the differences in light attenuations balogh et al 2000 shifts between the chemical types in this phase can also occur as a result of the precipitation of ions associated with increasing salinity different salts display high degrees of variation in their solubility giving rise to a precipitation sequence which is affected by temperature carbon dioxide and anion concentrations e g warren 2006 in kelemen szék dolomite and calcite precipitation had previously been observed e g molnár and kuti 1978 but a recent investigation pointed out that the water was oversaturated with other minerals too e g muscovite albite clinochlore quartz simon et al 2011 leading to the crystallizations of these similarly six different kinds of salt crystal were found in zab szék gypsum halite natron thernadite thermonatrite trona szendrei et al 2006 the drying phase is subject to high amplitude fluctuations and the presence of extreme values in those environmental parameters crucial to the biota the ability of aquatic biota to adapt to extreme environmental parameters is highly dependent on their resilience adaptive strategies and the nature of the disturbance for instance its rate or duration james et al 2003 the amplitude of the fluctuation and the time period of this phase may therefore be of crucial importance to living organisms 4 4 phase 4 concentrated phase constant environmental circumstances are characteristic of the studied turbid soda pans contrary to the finding of meintjes et al 1994 who identified an unstable phase immediately before the drying out by the end of the drying phase all of the parameters reach their maximum values and these are then maintained without significant fluctuation through this phase conductivity can reach the hypersaline category on account of the decreasing water level and the indirect water supply through a hydraulically conducting seismic fault short cut from the pre neogene hydrogeological basement this in turn is characterized by its high total dissolved material content mádl szőnyi and tóth 2009 mádl szőnyi et al 2008 this linkage has already been pointed out elsewhere too especially with regard to kelemen szék simon et al 2011 additionally the pans become shallower as time passes thus the water is increasingly subjected to the great daily temperature variation and high level of irradiance for instance boros et al 2017 detected daily fluctuation of up to 28 c with a daily maximum temperature of 44 c in sós ér in august of 2015 as with the other hydrological phases the shift between the chemical types of the water is characteristic for two reasons i the process of continuous precipitation changes the proportion of the ions and anions according to the precipitation sequence and ii the water supply is derived from the upper reaches of the underlying hydrological regime though neogene hydrogeological basement is characterized by moderate total dissolved material content it is also true that it collects water from a very large territory and therefore from different sediment types leading to a diverse ionic composition e g mádl szőnyi and tóth 2009 várallyay 1967 this ionic heterogeneity may well then contribute to the shift in chemical types in the pans the concentrated phase may be regarded as a harsh environment dominated by extreme abiotic factors and this may well impose multiple stresses on the biota requiring adaptive and metabolic efforts certain competitive weakness osmotic abilities unselective feeding omnivorousness changes in morphological structures etc begon et al 2006 por 1980 to survive and to tolerate it 4 5 phase 5 desiccated phase after the concentrated phase the pans usually totally dry out for two to four months the colored pans in this study completely dried out every year in contrast to turbid pans where complete dry out was restricted to a certain hydrological cycle in this phase the whole lakebed is totally dry causing many changes in the landscape firstly soil can be chapped and characteristic salt efflorescence is left behind on the surface of the bottom secondly significant changes can occur in the vegetation species typical of saline environments such as champhorosma annua suaeda sp can appear or spread leading to shifts in ecosystems an aquatic ecosystem becomes terrestrial one in a wider sense or a soda pan turns into vakszik or szikfolt defined by boros et al 2013 in a narrower sense drought as one extreme of the hydrological continuum imposes stress on the biota organisms which live in these aquatic ecosystems have to adapt to this environmental condition different drought resistant strategies can help them to survive this phase such as varying life stages and life cycle patterns such as the timing of reproductive maturity the timing of metamorphosis and the production of eggs seeds cysts spores or asexual propagules e g brock et al 2003 meintjes et al 1994 williams 2005 5 conclusions due to their hydrological sensitivity shallow alkaline soda pans are subjected to high level fluctuations in water level generating significant changes in their physical and chemical content and ionic composition thus organisms living in these habitats must be able to tolerate and survive not only multiple stresses and extreme environmental conditions but also the fast high amplitude fluctuations of various parameters despite the seasonal and annual variation of the parameters the hydrological cycle of the pans can be divided into five phases filling diluted drying concentrated desiccated all the defined hydrological phases are clearly characterized by the constancy or its lack and the range of the environmental parameters as well as the differences between the turbid and colored types climate change together with smaller scale anthropogenic activity can affect the hydrological cycle by shortening its length making shifts or reversions in it or excluding some hydrological phase which is very important for the biota since they have less time to survive and they have to acclimatize to the changing ecosystem in the short term and to tolerate the harsh environment this study provides clear indicators for use in the recognition and analysis of hydrological cycles an area of key importance for lake managers since these aquatic ecosystems are highly variable habitats recommendations concerning the time of sampling are also made a deeper and more detailed knowledge of the phases of the hydrological cycle can also help decision makers to come to comprehensive and informed conclusions for example in the light of the present paper the timing of conservation treatments can be calibrated to the most appropriate hydrological phases as described herein causing only the minimum of disruption to the ecosystem e g water supply the use of which as a conservation tool in hungarian reconstructed soda pans is rather random as recommended during phase 1 2 understanding the processes and patterns in hydrological cycles together with a well chosen time period for sampling can help develop more effective and prescriptive conservation and management strategies for these unique aquatic ecosystems which require different approaches and criteria than freshwaters as for the limitations of this study the inclusion of more hydrological years or more soda pans forming wider gradient of surface depth ratio is suggested as a possible route to further improvements in and refinements of the results additionally collecting soil samples during the desiccated phase could also serve to round out results and

6407,in order to examine temporal patterns and the hydrological cycle of shallow soda pans six pans in hungarian great plain were sampled at monthly intervals over a period of 2 5 years water chemistry and physical parameters temperature ph dissolved oxygen conductivity light water color pt color turbidity phosphorous and nitrogen forms silica alkalinity chloride sulfate content chemical oxygen demand were measured both in the field and laboratory and analyzed using multivariate statistical methods it was possible to distinguish the pans on the basis of water color separating them into two groups g1 consisting of colored pans characterized by low turbidity and high pt color and g2 consisting of turbid pans characterized by high turbidity and low pt color both groups displayed temporal seasonal as well as annual trends and their hydrological cycles followed regular cyclical patterns three hydrological phases filling drying and desiccated were described in the case of the colored pans and five for the turbid filling diluted drying concentrated desiccated regarding the recommendation that there be a reduced time interval in the sampling to determine the typical chemical characterization of the pans keywords saline lake physicochemical parameters seasonality hydrological phases 1 introduction endorheic inland saline lakes occur worldwide their formation is very individual depending on the combined effects of four determining factors climate langbein 1961 geology simon et al 2011 geomorphology williams 2002 and hydrogeology mádl szőnyi and tóth 2009 this type of aquatic ecosystem is found in large numbers and their total volume accounts for about 0 006 of total global water williams 1986 which is very close to that of freshwater 0 007 shiklomanov 1990 williams 1993 inland saline lakes are very diverse in terms of their dominant anions water level fluctuation and depth boros et al 2013 seaman et al 1991 williams 2002 2005 yechieli and wood 2002 in central europe mainly in carpathian basin more than 100 soda pans are to be found these may be defined as follows boros et al 2013 tóth et al 2014 natural soda pans i are shallow depths of between 0 2 and 2 m and astatic ecosystems in which more than 1 3 of the natural origin bed is seasonally covered by open water with surface or pondweed vegetation at least 1 ha in extent ii in periods of total dry out mudflat vegetation appears and the percentage of macrophyte cover does not exceed 50 permanently iii their mean annual salt content is at least 1 g l 1 and dominated by sodium and hydrogen carbonate ions equivalent percentage of a minimum of 25 by ion and iv they have a saline character in terms of their habitats resident species and wildlife communities as a consequence of hydrological features namely their being closed shallow basins these ecosystems are especially vulnerable and their ecological status as well as their very existence is threatened by both climate change and human activities alcocer and escobar 1990 williams 2002 even relatively small fluctuations in the most sensitive areas may result in significant and irreversible changes in their natural characteristics hammer 1990 the effects of climate change on a central european regional scale that is windier winters and calmer summers increasing summer temperatures and decreasing annual precipitation may result in a variety of biotic and abiotic changes in lake ecosystems dokulil 2013 with reference to abiotic changes the decreasing water level and increasing water temperature of the lakes may be assumed to be capable of initiating a cascade of direct and indirect changes in other physical and chemical variables e g increasing salinity different nutrient status etc as a consequence of imbalance in hydrological regimes a reduction in the number of saline lakes and even their disappearance has already been observed worldwide alcocer and escobar 1990 dick et al 1994 as has also been the case with wetland areas mitsch 2013 mitsch and jørgensen 2004 what is more further decrease and decline are predicted williams 2002 saline lakes have a variety of ecological and societal values and functions boros et al 2013 williams 1993 thus their conservation is very important although the hungarian soda pans are located within the territory of national parks and are natura 2000 areas meaning they enjoy ex lege protection in reality the applied conservation management techniques represent a threat to them causing unpredictable changes shifts or reversions in their natural cycles including both biotic and abiotic features lengyel et al 2016 the development of appropriate management plans and tools which are necessarily quite different from those for freshwater ecosystems requires a deep and wide knowledge of both the biotic and abiotic processes in such ecosystems despite the increasing number of studies focusing on soda pans most of them have been designed to study mainly spatial patterns information gathered from numerous pans but generally with only one or two sampling occasions e g boros et al 2014 hecky and kilham 1973 pálffy et al 2014 stenger kovács et al 2014 szabó et al 2017 tóth et al 2014 the study of temporal changes on either the short seasonal or long term annual scales has lagged behind in spite of the astatic nature of soda pans which carries with it the assumption that they are temporally heterogeneous systems studies on seasonal trends of temporary intermittent saline ecosystems are scarce in the literature and may be reduced to a figure of only 14 lakes worldwide e g alcocer and bernal brooks 2002 alvarez et al 2006 lengyel et al 2016 oduor and schagerl 2007 furthermore most of these studies have focused primarily on the biota e g alvarez et al

typical plankton alvarez et al 2006 garcía et al 1997 garcía and niell 1993 lópez gonzález et al 1998 oduor and schagerl 2007 benthic macroinvertebrates alcocer et al 2001 and diatom communities lengyel et al 2016 and ii key environmental variables e g soluble reactive phosphorus salinity ph playing a determining role in the mentioned communities they have emphasized that these major environmental variables e g salinity are strongly influenced by the hydrological cycle of the lakes and have distinguished two annual phases the filling drying phases however a deep analysis focusing on the temporal trends of the hydrological regime and its relationship with the environmental variables has yet to be written extensive analysis to obtain a better understanding of the dynamics of ecosystems which can support the conservation and maintenance of soda pans is therefore to be considered of urgent importance taking this in to account the present paper had as its aims i the study of the seasonal dynamics of physical and chemical features of soda pans for two and a half hydrological years ii the comparison of the studied pans on the basis of their physical chemical features in order to recognize possible categories and iii the determination and description of the hydrological cycle at a higher resolution in each category what makes present paper both relevant and novel is that the analyses were carried out on a long term dataset and focused on the detailed temporal patterns of soda pans in contrast to other research focusing primarily on spatial patterns and based on only one or two sampling occasions e g boros et al 2014 tóth et al 2014 in this way present research further enhances the knowledge about the hydrological cycle of soda pans which is crucial for understanding ecological processes as well as being crucial to their correct conservation management 2 material and methods 2 1 sampling and sites six natural soda pans of the danube tisza interfluve part of the great hungarian plain were sampled on a monthly basis between may 2013 and july 2015 over this period altogether 116 samples were taken from bába szék bogárzó böddi szék kelemen szék sós ér and zab szék fig 1 the gps coordinates of the sites and their main limnological features are summarized in table 1 all soda pans may be categorized as hypertrophic on the basis of their total phosphorus content tp they are also hyposaline boros et al 2013 bába szék and böddi szék are of the na cl total carbonate type carbonate bicarbonate the other four pans belong to the na total carbonate cl chemical type boros et al 2013 all the pans occasionally or regularly dry out for a couple of months table 2 the bába szék and sós ér are colored pans humic materials are responsible for at least 55 of the light extinction boros et al 2013 while bogárzó böddi szék kelemen szék and zab szék belong to the turbid water type suspended particles cause at least 55 of the light extinction boros et al 2013 secchi transparency is very low 2 3 cm in the turbid types and somewhat higher 12 30 cm in the colored pans boros et al 2013 all the pans are shallow average water depths are less than 40 cm half of them böddi szék kelemen szék zab szék have a large surface area 100 ha but bába szék bogárzó and sós ér are typically small pans 20 ha 2 2 environmental parameters water temperature ph conductivity and dissolved oxygen were measured in the field using an hq40d hach lange portable multimeter water depth is very difficult to measure due to the intense seiching activity observed in temporary intermittent soda pans which results in significant water level fluctuation and therefore potentially unreliable data since there is a strong significant correlation between salinity and water depth e g horváth et al 2014 conductivity as an indicator of water level fluctuation was selected as a substitute for this hydrological variable irradiance was measured using an li 1400 li cor equipped with a spherical 4π quantum micro sensor us sqs l heinz walz gmbh at two different sites the shoreline and the middle of the pans for the statistical analyses the mean irradiance values were used in the laboratory concentrations of nitrite ammonium phosphorus forms total phosphorus tp soluble reactive phosphorus srp soluble reactive silica srsi sulfate content and water color pt color were determined using spectrophotometric methods according to apha 1998 and cuthbert and del giorgio 1992 chemical oxygen demand cod and alkalinity were measured using titrimetric methods apha 1998 carbonate and bicarbonate were calculated from alkalinity following németh 1998 chloride and nitrate were determined using an hq40d hach lange multimeter equipped with ion specific probes hach model iseci181 and iseno3181 the chemical types of the pans were determined based on the 12 categories set by boros et al 2014 2 3 statistical analyses all statistical analyses were performed in the 3 4 3 version of r software team 2010 using the vegan oksanen et al 2012 and ternary smith 2017 packages ternary diagrams were created to demonstrate the main chemical types of the pans on the basis of the proportion of tcarbonate hco3 and co3 2 chloride and sulfate ions principal component analysis pca was carried out after the log x 1 transformation of the data to verify the relationship between the environmental parameters and the most important physical optical water type of the pans as defined by boros et al 2013 non metric multidimensional scaling nmds was applied using the bray curtis dissimilarity index square root transformation and wisconsin double standardization i to analyze the temporal variation of samples and ii to recognize the hydrological patterns of the samples for nmds analyses the mean values of the environmental parameters were used for the various physical optical water types t tests were performed to determine whether or not the pans had different environmental parameters between the years linear models were created to determine any temporal trends in the environmental parameters for each physical optical water type 3 results 3 1 multivariate analyses of the measured environmental variables the measured environmental parameters were plotted using pca fig 2 the most important variables turned out to be carbonate 5 85 and srsi 2 72 for axis one turbidity 6 41 and irradiance 2 62 for axis two overall these two axes explained 54 54 of the variance in the data taking all variables together the samples were separated into two groups the first group included the samples from bába szék and sós ér g1 and the samples from bogárzó böddi szék kelemen szék and zab szék belonged to the other g2 table 3 summarizes the main physical and chemical features of the six soda pans despite the fact that the pans generally had lower carbonate and higher bicarbonate contents carbonate concentration displayed greater intensive annual fluctuation than bicarbonate in addition measured mean carbonate concentrations were approximately three times lower in g1 than in g2 regarding the other side of pca axis no significant difference in srsi between groups was observed the mean varying between 6 2 mg l 1 böddi szék and 17 sós ér and its coefficient of variation cv between 28 bába szék and 99 bogárzó on the other side of the axis significant changes in turbidity and irradiance resulted in the separation of groups for instance the lowest turbidity mean 225 fnu was measured in sós ér g1 and the highest mean 2123 fnu in zab szék g2 in addition cod pt color nutrients such as tp srp tn and chloride content also played a significant role in the separation of groups whilst do o2 saturation ph temperature and sulfate concentration were the parameters displaying the lowest level of fluctuation and were statistically similar in the pans the most colored pans were bába szék bogárzó and sós ér 1400 pt units these were associated with higher amount of cod and exhibited high degrees of annual fluctuation cv 79 with regard to the n and p forms the total nitrogen tn content was generally low 3 202 mg l 1 and the total phosphorous tp content was high 33 13975 µg l 1 in the pans g1 had a relatively lower and higher numbers of p and n forms respectively while g2 exhibited just the opposite characteristics chloride concentration changed over a broad scale 220 19000 mg l 1 cv 58 169 reaching extreme values in bogárzó 14700 mg l 1 böddi szék 11400 mg l 1 and sós ér 19000 mg l 1 in terms of their ionic composition and its seasonal variation the greater part of the samples 56 86 belonged to the tcarbonate cl type however other types also became characteristic in certain periods altogether five chemical types and subtypes occurred na tcarbonate na tcarbonate cl na cl tcarbonate na cl and na tcarbonate cl so4 2 fig 3 two different ionic types were characteristic of böddi szék kelemen szék and zab szék three types of bába szék four types of bogárzó and sós ér fig 3 over the course of the study period nmds analyses were performed in order to achieve a more refined categorization of the samples within g1 and g2 as the result of the analyses involving only those parameters with a lower degree of variability cv 30 and those deemed most determining by pca water samples could be separated according to hydrological years year 1 and year 2 with little overlap fig 4 a t test resulted in significant differences between the two years for the 11 variables tn cod srp so4 2 co3 2 hco3 cl conductivity pt color turbidity irradiance table 4 in general higher values for the environmental parameters were detected in the first year independently of group g1 g2 with the exception of tn and srp which were statistically higher in the second year since the pca analysis resulted in two groups g1 g2 and the nmds analysis resulted in two additional groups year 1 and year 2 further nmds analyses focusing on temporal trends were performed in these four cases the configurations obtained with the averaged physical and chemical data of the pans and achieved by nmds analyses followed a regular and cyclic pattern fig 5 temporal succession can be easily traced since in most cases they followed each other month after month with slight occasionally marked differences finally the values measured in end of year sample returned to or approached the initial state thus forming a cycle this clearly cyclical nature of the samples was interrupted every year in late autumn and the winter season regardless of whether the pans are colored or turbid nevertheless the pattern of the rupture seemed to be slightly different between the years independently of which group g1 g2 was considered in the first year the samples collected in december displayed a deviation in a positive direction positive aberration from the normal cycle fig 5 in the second year a step back in the negative direction was observed negative aberration in the samples originating from november to january resulting in a break in the cycle fig 5 3 2 hydrological pattern and water cycle besides cyclic and ordered patterns the samples were categorized according to the characteristic hydrological phases in each group and year based on changes in conductivity as the indicator of water level fluctuation an environmental parameter which is the most typical feature of soda pans the samples were categorized into three phases within every hydrological cycle independently of the groups g1 g2 temporal changes in the main environmental parameters are shown as phases in figs 6 and 7 in the first phase of the hydrological cycle the decrease in conductivity representing all ions and nutrients temperature pt color and cod were characteristic reaching a minimum after a couple of months in phase 3 the opposite trend was observed since conductivity temperature and cod continuously increased and reached their maximum values at the end of this phase some differences were observed in g1 and g2 enumerated here 1 with regard to the light and pt color during the phases 1 and 3 opposite trends were characteristic in g1 light intensity was constant in both phases pt color initially decreased then showed an increasing tendency in contrast light intensity displayed decreasing then increasing trends while for pt color there were decreasing and constant trends during the two phases of g2 2 there was a difference between the groups in the number of the phases g2 had two additional phases namely phases 2 and 4 during these phases all parameters except temperature which slightly decreased in phase 2 did not change significantly furthermore an additional difference was found in phase 5 between the groups the pans of g2 did not dry out completely in every year as was the case in those belonging to g1 table 2 4 discussion this study aims to provide a comprehensive temporal characterization of environmental variables for soda pans as highly variable habitats according to the general trend with the increasing distance of the lakes the difference in their water chemical features also increases e g kling et al 2000 but in terms of differences in water chemistry a mosaic pattern emerges as in temporary saline pans in africa and north american freshwater lakes meintjes et al 1994 soranno et al 1999 the geographically close pans had different physical and chemical characteristics these features of soda pans can be derived from four main factors climate geology geomorphology and hydrogeology gibbs 1970 henriksen 1992 since the area of the danube tisza interfluve is too small to have substantially different climatic effects or changes in geology it may be considered homogeneous in this respect i e the study area is located in a geochemical window as defined by mádl szőnyi and tóth 2009 meaning that and the mosaic pattern originates from geomorphological e g distance from the groundwater table and hydrogeological factors e g discharge areas e g mádl szőnyi et al 2008 simon et al 2011 in the hungarian soda pans irradiance alkalinity conductivity and nutrients srp and nitrate were the main environmental parameters as in natural african mexican and spanish shallow saline lakes alcocer and bernal brooks 2002 margalef 1983 oduor and schagerl 2007 talling and talling 1965 the salinity of soda pans is mainly derived from two underlying hydrogeological regimes neogene sediments and pre neogene sediments as described by mádl szőnyi and tóth 2009 tóth and almási 2001 as well as silica content hurley et al 1985 wetzel 2001 high trophic status may result from an elevated amount of guano boros et al 2008b and the closed basin nature of the pans which has the effect of increasing residence time samples were distinguished according to variables related to the optical features of the pans leading to the separation of the colored g1 and turbid g2 pans the main environmental variables displayed a high degree of seasonal variation in relation to the hydrological cycle nutrient content as well as the level of salinity changed with the water level negative scores in srsi were probably caused by the assimilation of silica by diatoms chrysophytes and some aquatic higher plants wetzel 2001 the main environmental parameters exhibited not only seasonal but also annual variation relatively low salinity anion concentration and the enhanced nitrogen and srp concentration in the second year were consequences of the higher amount of precipitation according to the hungarian meteorological service www met hu annual precipitation was approximately 650 740 and 540 mm in 2013 2014 and 2015 respectively which diluted the waters and increased the nutrient level through runoff derived from the surrounding agricultural areas stenger kovács et al 2014 the studied pans can be characterized with different chemical types based on the system defined by boros et al 2014 within individual years accordingly simple categorizations e g based on a single measurement should only be applied with caution since this classification is strongly time dependent the most problematic pan was bába szék where only the 56 of the samples belonged to the na cl tcarbonate type and 44 were distributed between other two chemical types na tcarbonate and na tcarbonate cl type in contrast rather stable conditions were found in sós ér 85 of the samples belonged to na tcarbonate cl type though a further three chemical types can be detected na tcarbonate na cl tcarbonate and na cl type for that reason a reduced time period in april and may is still adequate to sample water and determine the main ions for defining the most significant chemical type of the pans since there was no change in chemical type in this period seasonal patterns in the values of environmental parameters can be distinguished for both the turbid and colored pans in similar ecosystems e g garcía et al 1997 two hydrological phases filling and drying phases are already well known and this is in contrast to the central european soda pans where altogether five hydrological phases phases 1 5 can be distinguished in pans of the turbid type and three phases 1 3 5 in pans of the colored type the reasons for this difference may be morphological and hydrogeological in origin resulting from their different surface areas and the volumes associated with endorheic features leading to different residence times in addition the maintenance of higher water volume and consequently longer water coverage of turbid pans may well result from the water supply from the underlying hydrogeological regimes since subsurface waters can rise up through groundwater raise lens kiss 1979 with regard to kelemen szék a substantial water supply was found during the summer season in particular may to july weidinger et al 2007 colored pans have much smaller water bodies meaning smaller holding capacity faster warming and drying out there is not enough time to sustain phases 2 and 4 the following classification of hydrological cycles for shallow soda pans is proposed and is briefly summarized in table 5 and fig 8 4 1 phase 1 filling phase this is the first phase of the hydrological cycle when as a consequence of the increasing water level most parameters usually start to decrease the beginning of this filling phase approximately coincides with late summer or early autumn after a couple of months the values of the variables reach their minima as a consequence of the high amount of precipitation in this phase the water level increases causing decreasing conductivity nutrient levels and pt color independently of the optical water type turbid or colored pans because of the shallowness of these ecosystems temperature continuously decreases closely following weather conditions is parallel with decreasing dissolved oxygen demand as far as irradiance is concerned the opposite trend is to be observed between the optical water types in turbid pans pt color decreases with increasing water levels associated with the mixing of water by rain or wind resulting in the resuspension of the inorganic content and leading to a low light level in colored pans the underwater light regime is more balanced due to the absence or scarcity of the inorganic component and the negative correlation between the water level and pt color the available light regime is a key environmental factor since it controls many other physical and chemical features such as ph co2 and o2 concentration via its effects on photosynthesis mallin and paerl 1992 furthermore the emergent redox potential of the water has a significant effect on other chemical processes such as nutrient availability wetzel 2001 overall the filling phase can be characterized as having a high degree of fluctuation in environmental variables by the end of this phase for instance conductivity shifts from the hypersaline to the freshwater category hammer 1986 williams 1967 and a light saturated condition changes to light limited besides the changes in the parameters shifts in chemical types also can occur due to the re dissolution of ions but this occurs independently of the totally dried out status as concluded earlier fernández aláez et al 2006 vangenechten et al 1981 environmental parameters change along a steep gradient within a relatively short period even one month which can be crucial for the biota this is partly due to the development of more favorable conditions such as low conductivity which can lead to establishment of diverse aquatic assemblages however a poor light regime in terms of both quantity and quality can exert a further influence on biotic processes falkowski and laroche 1991 kirk 1994 macintyre et al 2002 4 2 phase 2 diluted phase this phase starts after the filling phase at the end of the autumn or early winter and lasts for a few 2 3 months during the diluted phase the pans are characterized by a high water level low conductivity and lacking significant fluctuations in pt color and cod since water turbidity has little effect on light quality spectral composition elevated levels of turbidity mainly cause the reduction of light intensity kirk 1994 depending on variation in local weather variation the temperature may be more or less constantly low or decrease continuously shifts in the chemical types of the water can occur as a result of weather events such as strong precipitation in the form of rain or freezing which has significant abrupt short term effects on physical and chemical characteristics in small water bodies e g weyhenmeyer et al 2004 these weather phenomena are the responsible for the positive and negative aberrations observed in the cyclic hydrological patterns a diluted phase may be characterized by the constancy of the environmental parameters in this phase however low irradiance and temperature may become the key environmental factors determining the distribution of organisms 4 3 phase 3 drying phase around the end of winter or in early spring the values of most environmental parameters start to increase again reaching their maxima towards the end of spring or early summer increasing conductivity temperature and cod are typical of this phase indicating decreases in the amount of change in water level dissolved oxygen concentration and saturation vary according to local conditions such as temperature and water depth the shallower and warmer the water the lower the oxygen concentration generally the pans are well oxygenated but sometimes hypoxia can develop by the end of this phase as the concentration of oxygen drops beneath the lethal oxygen threshold for various organisms less than 2 mg l 1 e g diaz and rosenberg 1995 wetzel 2001 elevated levels of dissolved oxygen were also measured suggesting the presence of significant phytoplankton and picoplankton biomass a phenomenon well known in such habitats e g boros et al 2013 felföldi et al 2009 keresztes et al 2012 pálffy et al 2014 somogyi et al 2014 2017 temperature oxygen concentration and ph have strong effects on nutrient levels goldman and horne 1983 the release rate of phosphorus is highly temperature dependent jensen and andersen 1992 kamp nielsen 1975 søndergaard 1988 1989 low oxygen content can contribute to the redox dependent release of phosphorus boström et al 1982 while elevated ph can promote the availability of p leuven et al 1992 the concentration of phosphorous in this phase seems to have resulted not only from autochthonous sources but also allochthonous processes due to the abundance of waterfowl boros et al 2008a boros et al 2008b temperature and ph affect the available n content and form through the regulation of the nitrification goldman and horne 1983 alkaline conditions ph 9 associated with high temperatures however cause a shift toward nh3 from nh4 resulting in an n limiting environment in spite of the high dissolved oxygen content boros et al 2013 bouldin et al 1974 hopkins and hüner 2004 jones and grant 1999 this nitrogen limited condition is favored by nitrogen fixing algae like aphanizomenon and anabaenopsis ssp one of the dominant algal groups in these ecosystems boros et al 2013 on the other hand nitrification requires a high dissolved oxygen content thus it can contribute to the development of anoxic conditions together with the accumulation of no2 as intermediate product as with the filling phase some differences can be observed between the turbid and colored pans in terms of the light regime and pt color on the basis of the doc water color relationship boros et al 2013 pace and cole 2002 in the absence or scarcity of macrophyte vegetation in this phase the pt color is constant in the turbid pans in a way similar to other shallow ecosystems water level fluctuations generate shifts between clear and turbid water states beklioglu et al 2001 blindow 1992 but in these soda pans this process is independent of the macrophytes this negative correlation can be attributed to two factors i in absence of strong winds in summer inorganic components may settle and ii the smaller the surface of the pans the less effective the mixing power of the wind in contrast the water becomes more brownish in the colored pans due to a greater extend of macrophyte coverage and thus the light regime can remain constant despite the decreasing water level the humic material content represented by pt color has a significant influence on the spectral composition of the light regime due to the differences in light attenuations balogh et al 2000 shifts between the chemical types in this phase can also occur as a result of the precipitation of ions associated with increasing salinity different salts display high degrees of variation in their solubility giving rise to a precipitation sequence which is affected by temperature carbon dioxide and anion concentrations e g warren 2006 in kelemen szék dolomite and calcite precipitation had previously been observed e g molnár and kuti 1978 but a recent investigation pointed out that the water was oversaturated with other minerals too e g muscovite albite clinochlore quartz simon et al 2011 leading to the crystallizations of these similarly six different kinds of salt crystal were found in zab szék gypsum halite natron thernadite thermonatrite trona szendrei et al 2006 the drying phase is subject to high amplitude fluctuations and the presence of extreme values in those environmental parameters crucial to the biota the ability of aquatic biota to adapt to extreme environmental parameters is highly dependent on their resilience adaptive strategies and the nature of the disturbance for instance its rate or duration james et al 2003 the amplitude of the fluctuation and the time period of this phase may therefore be of crucial importance to living organisms 4 4 phase 4 concentrated phase constant environmental circumstances are characteristic of the studied turbid soda pans contrary to the finding of meintjes et al 1994 who identified an unstable phase immediately before the drying out by the end of the drying phase all of the parameters reach their maximum values and these are then maintained without significant fluctuation through this phase conductivity can reach the hypersaline category on account of the decreasing water level and the indirect water supply through a hydraulically conducting seismic fault short cut from the pre neogene hydrogeological basement this in turn is characterized by its high total dissolved material content mádl szőnyi and tóth 2009 mádl szőnyi et al 2008 this linkage has already been pointed out elsewhere too especially with regard to kelemen szék simon et al 2011 additionally the pans become shallower as time passes thus the water is increasingly subjected to the great daily temperature variation and high level of irradiance for instance boros et al 2017 detected daily fluctuation of up to 28 c with a daily maximum temperature of 44 c in sós ér in august of 2015 as with the other hydrological phases the shift between the chemical types of the water is characteristic for two reasons i the process of continuous precipitation changes the proportion of the ions and anions according to the precipitation sequence and ii the water supply is derived from the upper reaches of the underlying hydrological regime though neogene hydrogeological basement is characterized by moderate total dissolved material content it is also true that it collects water from a very large territory and therefore from different sediment types leading to a diverse ionic composition e g mádl szőnyi and tóth 2009 várallyay 1967 this ionic heterogeneity may well then contribute to the shift in chemical types in the pans the concentrated phase may be regarded as a harsh environment dominated by extreme abiotic factors and this may well impose multiple stresses on the biota requiring adaptive and metabolic efforts certain competitive weakness osmotic abilities unselective feeding omnivorousness changes in morphological structures etc begon et al 2006 por 1980 to survive and to tolerate it 4 5 phase 5 desiccated phase after the concentrated phase the pans usually totally dry out for two to four months the colored pans in this study completely dried out every year in contrast to turbid pans where complete dry out was restricted to a certain hydrological cycle in this phase the whole lakebed is totally dry causing many changes in the landscape firstly soil can be chapped and characteristic salt efflorescence is left behind on the surface of the bottom secondly significant changes can occur in the vegetation species typical of saline environments such as champhorosma annua suaeda sp can appear or spread leading to shifts in ecosystems an aquatic ecosystem becomes terrestrial one in a wider sense or a soda pan turns into vakszik or szikfolt defined by boros et al 2013 in a narrower sense drought as one extreme of the hydrological continuum imposes stress on the biota organisms which live in these aquatic ecosystems have to adapt to this environmental condition different drought resistant strategies can help them to survive this phase such as varying life stages and life cycle patterns such as the timing of reproductive maturity the timing of metamorphosis and the production of eggs seeds cysts spores or asexual propagules e g brock et al 2003 meintjes et al 1994 williams 2005 5 conclusions due to their hydrological sensitivity shallow alkaline soda pans are subjected to high level fluctuations in water level generating significant changes in their physical and chemical content and ionic composition thus organisms living in these habitats must be able to tolerate and survive not only multiple stresses and extreme environmental conditions but also the fast high amplitude fluctuations of various parameters despite the seasonal and annual variation of the parameters the hydrological cycle of the pans can be divided into five phases filling diluted drying concentrated desiccated all the defined hydrological phases are clearly characterized by the constancy or its lack and the range of the environmental parameters as well as the differences between the turbid and colored types climate change together with smaller scale anthropogenic activity can affect the hydrological cycle by shortening its length making shifts or reversions in it or excluding some hydrological phase which is very important for the biota since they have less time to survive and they have to acclimatize to the changing ecosystem in the short term and to tolerate the harsh environment this study provides clear indicators for use in the recognition and analysis of hydrological cycles an area of key importance for lake managers since these aquatic ecosystems are highly variable habitats recommendations concerning the time of sampling are also made a deeper and more detailed knowledge of the phases of the hydrological cycle can also help decision makers to come to comprehensive and informed conclusions for example in the light of the present paper the timing of conservation treatments can be calibrated to the most appropriate hydrological phases as described herein causing only the minimum of disruption to the ecosystem e g water supply the use of which as a conservation tool in hungarian reconstructed soda pans is rather random as recommended during phase 1 2 understanding the processes and patterns in hydrological cycles together with a well chosen time period for sampling can help develop more effective and prescriptive conservation and management strategies for these unique aquatic ecosystems which require different approaches and criteria than freshwaters as for the limitations of this study the inclusion of more hydrological years or more soda pans forming wider gradient of surface depth ratio is suggested as a possible route to further improvements in and refinements of the results additionally collecting soil samples during the desiccated phase could also serve to round out results and

6408,prediction of river flow as a fundamental source of hydrological information plays a crucial role in various fields of water projects in this study at first the capabilities of two time series analysis approaches namely self exciting threshold autoregressive setar and generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity garch models then three artificial intelligence approaches including artificial neural networks ann multivariate adaptive regression splines mars and random forests rf models were investigated to predict monthly river flow for this purpose monthly river flow data of brantford and galt stations on grand river canada for the period from october 1948 to september 2017 were used and their performances were evaluated based on various evaluation criteria the setar model showed better performance than the garch one in prediction of river flows at the stations of study additionally the stand alone mars and rf models performed slightly better than the ann next hybrid models were developed by coupling the used ann mars and rf models with setar and garch models as the non linear time series models the performance of various models presented in this study indicated that the new hybrid models demonstrated a much better performance compared with the stand alone ones at both stations among the developed hybrid models the rf setar models generally had the best accuracy to improve the river flows modeling as a result it can be concluded that the presented methodology can be used to predict hydrological time series such as river flow with a high level of accuracy keywords ann mars rf setar garch monthly river flow canada 1 introduction an accurate estimation of river flows in watersheds and water resources systems plays a major role for more timely and efficient management of water projects furthermore having information on the river flows is needed to manage rivers flood warning systems and especially planning for optimal operations river flow modeling seems to be a complex process due to the impacts of hydro climatic variables such as evaporation temperature precipitation etc on river flow there are commonly two approaches in estimation of river flows which can be classified in two groups of physically based or conceptual and mathematically based or data driven models gershenfeld and weigend 1994 peueot et al 2003 babovic 2005 di et al 2014 he et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 the physically based models are complex and need complicated mathematical tools sufficient physical data and some extent of expertise and experience with the models that impede the application of these types of models aqil et al 2007 he et al 2014 while data driven models are simpler to implement not so complex and they do not require any information on the physical nature of hydrological processes as these models are popular and commonly used for modeling hydrological processes therefore they can be helpful and valuable for modeling river flows chau et al 2005 nayak et al 2005 wu et al 2009 he et al 2014 artificial intelligence approaches as one of the data driven models are able to model hydrological processes using only a series of input data although they may have some disadvantages for example they do not include any physical parameters additionally non considering the stochastic component of hydrological variables along with the deterministic component obtained by these models can be another disadvantage of these methods accordingly it seems that the use of these models alone cannot be an appropriate approach in modeling the hydrologic time series in such circumstances artificial intelligence models coupled with the time series models can be taken into account for hydrological processes instead of using single models during recent decades artificial intelligence models have being extensively applied to predict hydrologic time series such as streamflow artificial neural networks ann multivariate adaptive regression splines mars and random forests rf are three kinds of these models yu et al 2004 introduced a hybrid model by combining the chaos theory and support vector machine svm namely ec svm for daily runoff forecasting of tryggevælde catchment denmark and the mississippi river at vicksburg the proposed ec svm hybrid model was found to be better than other methods used including standard chaos naive inverse and autoregressive integrated moving average arima kisi and cimen 2011 evaluated the performance of wavelet support vector regression w svr and single svr for monthly streamflow prediction at canakdere and goksudere rivers turkey the results revealed that the proposed w svr presented better performance than the stand alone svr to predict streamflow samsudin et al 2011 predicted monthly river flow of selangor and bernam rivers malaysia using group method of data handling gmdh coupled with the least squares support vector machine lssvm named as glssvm single gmdh and lssvm as well as ann and arima models it was concluded that the new hybrid model i e glssvm had the best accuracy in comparison with the other models sanikhani and kisi 2012 employed two different types of adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis namely grid partitioning anfis gp and subtractive clustering anfis sc for modeling monthly river flow at garzan and bitlis streams turkey the results of this study uncovered that the anfis sc outperformed the anfis gp kalteh 2013 used the ann and svr techniques combined with wavelet transform for predicting monthly river flow of kharjegil and ponel stations iran the results showed that the single svr had slightly better accuracy compared with the single ann awchi 2014 forecasted monthly river discharge of bakhma and dokan sites on the upper and lower zab river in northern iraq respectively using feed forward neural networks ffnn generalized regression neural networks grnn radial basis function neural networks rbfnn and multiple linear regression mlr it was found that the ffnn outperformed the other used models terzi and ergin 2014 employed autoregressive ar time series model as well as gene expression programming gep rbfnn ffnn and anfis for predicting monthly river flow of kızılırmak river turkey they reported that the ar model performed the best in addition the gep and anfis had higher accuracy than the rbfnn and ffnn zhang et al 2016 introduced a hybrid model namely ceref which is an integration of empirical mode decomposition emd rbfnn and external forces ef variable they concluded that the suggested ceref model can be considered as a suitable and alternative approach to predict annual streamflow of wuding river basin yaseen et al 2016a conducted a comparative study among extreme learning machine elm grnn and svr for monthly streamflow prediction in the tigris river iraq the elm model was found to be better than the svr and grnn ones ghorbani et al 2016a predicted monthly river flow of some hydrometric stations on zarrinehrud river iran using multilayer perceptron mlp svm and rbfnn the results showed that the predictions of rbfnn and mlp were better than the svm the forecasting performance of ffnn and rbfnn models were assessed by yaseen et al 2016b for daily river flow at johor river malaysia the superiority of the rbfnn over the ffnn was reported in this study ghorbani et al 2016b modeled daily river discharge by the svm ann conventional mlr and rating curve rc approaches for big cypress river texas usa performance evaluation of models revealed that peak values of river discharge modeled by the ann and svm models were more accurate than those obtained by the mlr and rc ravansalar et al 2017 introduced wavelet linear genetic programming w lgp to model the monthly streamflow at pataveh and shahmokhtar stations located on beshar river iran furthermore the w lgp model performance was evaluated in comparison with the single ann lgp wavelet ann w ann and mlr the results revealed that the proposed w lgp model had the highest accuracy at the studied regions moeeni et al 2017 used seasonal arima i e sarima integrated with anfis and ann methods for monthly inflow prediction the results presented that the hybrid sarima anfis model is the superior model among all fathian et al 2019 employed the multiple linear var vector auto regressive and nonlinear dvech diagonal vectorization heteroscedasticity time series models in modeling daily streamflow process the results demonstrated that the hybrid var dvech has better performance than the var model some of detailed information on previous studies reviewed in this study is summarized in table 1 among many time series models developed for modeling hydrological time series two models namely setar self exciting threshold autoregressive and garch generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity were used in the present study these models are as the new non linear types of time series models which have not widely been used to modeling hydrological processes komorník et al 2006 modarres and ouarda 2013 this research attempts to predict monthly river flow of brantford and galt stations situated on grand river canada in this regard the aims of this study are 1 to assess the accuracy of the stand alone setar garch ann mars and rf models for predicting monthly river flow 2 to develop hybrid models by coupling the ann mars and rf models with setar and garch models and 3 to compare the accuracy of river flow modeling by the hybrid models proposed in this study with the stand alone ones it can be noted that the hydrological time series like river flow is comprised of stochastic and deterministic components it is worthwhile to be expressed that according to the authors knowledge the stochastic component of river flow has not usually been considered in the previous studies through the non linear time series models however in this study the stochastic components of river flow data were considered in the modeling procedure on the other hand recent works on modeling the hydrological variables such as river flow have focused on the separate application of artificial intelligence and time series models however the use of artificial intelligence models is more than the time series models in hydrological modeling in contrast the application of hybrid artificial intelligence time series models in literature for hydrological parameters modeling is significantly less than for the stand alone artificial intelligence and time series models besides few studies have been reported in literature to consider the stochastic behavior of river flow in modeling procedure by the time series models in coupled with the artificial intelligence techniques through the hybrid artificial intelligence time series models therefore this study as an innovation investigates the abilities of the ann mars and rf models coupled with the non linear setar and garch time series models in predicting monthly river flow 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data used the present study was carried out for two hydrometric stations namely brantford and galt situated on grand river in canada the grand river as a large river in southwestern ontario canada with length of 280 km is entirely within southern ontario s boundaries and it flows southwards to lake erie https www grandriver ca en index aspx the geographical location of study area is demonstrated in fig 1 the monthly river flow data were acquired from the official website of the government of canada https wateroffice ec gc ca with the length of 828 monthly data from october 1948 to september 2017 in order to train the models the first 588 data about 71 of the total data of river flow time series from october 1948 to september 1997 for each station was used in addition the data between october 1997 and september 2017 240 months about 29 of the total data were employed in test stage fig 2 illustrates the observation time series plot of monthly river flow data for both stations throughout the studied period the statistical properties of the river flow time series are presented in table 2 as clear generally similar statistical parameters are observed for both train and test periods it is better to mention that the observed river flow time series must be standardized due to the use of time series models i e setar and garch for predicting river flows as well as to eliminate the dimension of observational river flow datasets herein whole monthly river flow datasets of the studied stations were standardized through the following equation 1 q s q o q o σ q o where qs qo q o and σ q o denote the standardized river flow data observed river flow data the mean of observed data and the standard deviation of observed data respectively mehdizadeh et al 2019 2 2 ann model the ann is the biologically inspired approach which is widely used to estimate complex and non linear systems in the ann the relationships between input and output variables are simulated by inspiration from the human brain features in general an ann model is composed of three layers and as an example the structure of the ann model used in the present study is illustrated in fig 3 the first layer is the input layer that receives the input information the hidden layer is the information processing sector the last layer is the output layer that receives the processed information from the previous layer and then gives the final output moreover each layer consists of processor units called neurons the general form of an ann can be expressed as 2 y f i 1 n x i w i b i where y is the output xi denotes the input vector i 1 2 n wi is the weight vector bi is the bias and f is the transfer activation function in this research in order to predict the river flow data feed forward back propagation neural networks having three layer were applied input layer is composed of different combinations of lagged monthly river flow data see table 3 the same input and output variables were considered for the mars and rf models the hidden layer plays a significant role to achieve high performance by the ann therefore using trial and error method the optimal numbers of neurons were acquired for the hidden layer training the ann is in fact to adjust the values of network parameters consisting of weights between input and hidden layers as well as between hidden and output layers and biases between the hidden and output layers moreover the functions used in the hidden and output layers were respectively tangent sigmoid and linear transfer functions 2 3 mars model the mars as a non parametric regression approach was presented by friedman 1991 to reveal hidden non linear pattern in datasets with a large number of variables this model is based on functions named basis functions which are defined as follows 3 max 0 x c max 0 c x where x is the input and c is a constant which is called knot these basis functions eq 3 are known as spline functions being in fact a reflected pair at c knot fig 4 the general form of the mars can be defined as below 4 y f x c 0 i 1 m c i b i x where y is the dependent variable estimated by the mars co is a constant b i x is the ith basis function and ci is the coefficient of ith basis function where all ci coefficients are determined by minimizing the sum of square errors fitting the mars model is executed in two stages consisting of forward and backward stages in the forward stage a large number of basis functions with different knots are consecutively added to the model and an over fitted and complex model is created in the backward stage the basis functions which may have less impact on the estimation process are pruned by the mars finally the optimum mars model is chosen based on the lowest value of generalized cross validation gcv criterion gcv can be expressed as 5 gcv m 1 n i 1 n y i f x i 2 1 c m n 2 where y i is the target output f xi is the estimated output n is the number of dataset and c m is a penalty which is defined as 6 c m m 1 d m where m is the number of basis functions and d is a penalty for each basis function involved in the model 2 4 rf model the rf as a powerful ensemble learning algorithm was first introduced by breiman 2001 which is used for regression analysis classification and unsupervised learning purposes liaw and wiener 2002 the rf algorithm with the permutation and continuous change of the factors affecting the target variable leads to the creation of a large number of decision trees and then all the trees are combined for the prediction fig 5 illustrates a general structure of rf technique as the number of trees increases the over fitting effect that occurs in the decision tree method is eliminated thus at each stage of tree growth the model is more precise and the error rate decreases the bagging procedure is applied in the rf to choose the random samples of parameters as the training dataset then for each variable the function establishes model prediction error if the values of that variable are permuted across the out of bag observations trigila et al 2015 several bootstrap samples of the data are involved in the rf construction the bootstrap method is a sampling method with permutation thus by repeating the sampling operation some out of bags datasets are created from the training dataset out of bag predictions are one of the main functions in tuning of the rf for evaluation and generate much faster results in comparison with other methods probst et al 2019 the number of trees ntree is the most important feature of the model that can affect the performance of rf modeling which is considered as ntree 500 furthermore the number of variables on each node i e mtry is another user defined parameter of rf implementation here mtry 1 was applied in modeling process testing more numbers for trees and variables on each node revealed that ntree 500 and mtry 1 showed relatively better results 2 5 setar model one of the non linear time series model groups is the threshold auto regressive tar models which are called as a group of non linear regime switching approaches in these types of non linear time series models the time series characteristics consisting of mean variance and autocorrelation differ in various regimes cryer and chan 2008 tsay 2010 one of the special cases of the non linear tar model is the setar model tong 1983 used in the present study on the basis of tar based models structure a parameter called threshold determines the movements of each time series between regimes the threshold parameter for the setar models can be either a given value of the time series used in modeling procedure or a parameter that is determined by an algorithm komorník et al 2006 if we consider y1 yn as the time series dataset for modeling we can define a two regime setar model shown as setar p r cryer and chan 2008 as 7 y t φ 0 1 i 1 p φ i 1 y t i ε t 1 i f y t d τ φ 0 2 i 1 r φ i 2 y t i ε t 2 i f y t d τ where n is the length of the time series and φ i j i 1 2 p i 1 2 r j 1 2 are the ar models coefficients the orders of the lower and upper regimes of the ar models are denoted as p and r respectively d is as a delay time τ is the threshold amount or transition parameter ε t is the residual time series at time t ε t ñ 0 σ 2 tsay 2010 at the first step in modeling procedure of a two regime setar time series model both the threshold value τ and the lag time parameter d should be determined the time series dataset according to the defined limit of each regime y t d τ or not can be divided into two parts so that the data that are smaller or larger than the threshold values are discerned finally for each regime the same ar model is fitted to each time series dataset detected according to the threshold parameter by minimizing the akaike information criterion aic for a fixed τ and d the orders of the ar model are obtained cryer and chan 2008 as 8 aic p r τ d 2 l τ d 2 p r 2 l τ d n p 2 1 log 2 π n 1 τ d 2 log σ 1 τ d 2 n 2 τ d 2 log σ 2 τ d 2 in this equation l τ d is the log likelihood function that is used to estimate τ and d the number of observations in each regime are n 1 and n 2 as well as error variances in the lower and upper regimes are σ 1 and σ 2 respectively cryer and chan 2008 2 6 garch model the garch approach as a non linear time series model was first suggested by engle 1982 and then extended by bollerslev 1986 to model volatility or conditional variance of a univariate time series in this approach it is assumed that the obtained residual time series from the model fitted to hydrological time series are dependent upon time in such conditions it is expected that variance is not constant over time conditional time variant variance so that the arch efficacy exists in the residuals in fact the garch approach can describe the trends of conditional variance according to the information of past events the general structure of a garch model can be written as 9 σ t 2 v a r ε t ε u u t ω i 1 v α i ε t i 2 j 1 m β j σ t j 2 10 ε t σ t e t e t normal 0 1 ε t ψ t 1 normal 0 σ t 2 where σ t 2 v a r ε t ε u u t is the conditional heteroscedasticity of the residuals ω is a constant α 1 α v and β 1 β m are the garch model s coefficients as well as the orders of the model s coefficients are v and m as seen in the garch model formula σ t 2 value depends on the v past squared residual time series and the m lagged conditional variance it should be noted that if m 0 garch v m arch v the aic and maximum likelihood estimation mle techniques are used to identify the garch model orders and the model s parameters cryer and chan 2008 2 7 coupling the ann mars and rf with setar and garch models as mentioned the main aim of this study is to improve the accuracy of monthly river flow modeling using the ann mars and rf methods coupled with setar and garch time series models accordingly the following steps were followed 1 the deterministic component of the monthly river flow data was predicted using the stand alone ann mars and rf models 2 the optimal setar models were fitted to the standardized monthly river flow time series of the two stations to obtain ε t values 3 the optimum garch model was fitted to the ε t 2 values obtained from each setar model in the previous step 4 the deterministic component dt of river flow data by the stand alone ann mars and rf models was coupled and combined with the stochastic component st obtained from the setar and garch models as below 11 y t d t s t 5 the final step was to scale up the obtained yt values by de standardization procedure 2 8 evaluation criteria the performance of stand alone ann mars rf setar garch and hybrid ann setar mars setar rf setar ann garch mars garch and rf garch models was evaluated for predicting the monthly river flow data based on four statistical evaluation indicators these evaluation criteria include root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae coefficient of determination r2 and nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient e proposed by nash and sutcliffe 1970 these indicators can be defined as 12 rmse i 1 n q o i q p i 2 n 13 mae i 1 n q o i q p i n 14 r 2 i 1 n q o i q o q p i q p i 1 n q o i q o 2 i 1 n q p i q p 2 2 15 e 1 i 1 n q o i q p i 2 i 1 n q o i q o 2 where qo i and qp i are respectively the ith observed and predicted monthly river flow q o is the mean of observed monthly river flow data q p is the mean of predicted monthly river flow data and n is the number of data in each studied dataset 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance evaluation of the stand alone and developed hybrid models the results of fitting the setar and garch time series models indicated that setar 1 1 and garch 1 0 are the optimal models fitted to the streamflow datasets of the studied areas equations of the optimum setar and garch models fitted to both of stations are presented in table 4 table 5 also illustrates the values of statistical parameters calculated for the optimal setar and garch time series models for both train and test periods as seen the setar models developed at brantford and galt stations give better accuracies than the garch ones error indicators of the setar models obtained for the test stage are as rmse 14 13 m3 s mae 10 64 m3 s r2 0 895 e 0 894 at brantford station and rmse 10 25 m3 s mae 7 59 m3 s r2 0 895 e 0 894 at galt one as previously mentioned in table 3 one to three months lagged river flow data in the form of standardized was applied as inputs of the artificial intelligence techniques these lags were selected based on the auto correlation functions acf graphs of the standardized data as clearly seen in fig 6 the first three time lags i e qt 1 to qt 3 demonstrate significant effect on qt the acf values of other lags are within the confidence intervals hence the first three lags were employed as the inputs in modeling procedure as noted the performance of ann is affected by the number of neurons in the hidden layer various trial and errors for the number of neurons in the hidden layer revealed that their optimal numbers at brantford station were 2 2 and 1 for the ann1 ann2 and ann3 respectively moreover the optimal numbers of neurons in the hidden layer at galt station were 3 2 and 1 respectively for the ann1 ann2 and ann3 for example the structure of ann2 at brantford and galt stations is 2 2 1 which means that the developed ann respectively contains two two and one neurons in the input hidden and output layers see fig 3 performance evaluation of the stand alone ann mars and rf models and their corresponding hybrid models with setar and garch models are listed in tables 6 and 7 for both train and test stages at brantford and galt stations respectively it is obvious from the tables that there are slight differences between the performance of the stand alone ann mars and rf models in the scenarios considered for predicting the monthly river flow however the mars and rf models perform slightly better than the ann at both stations for the scenarios with similar inputs in the second part of current research the results obtained from the stand alone ann mars and rf models including the deterministic component of the monthly river flow data were coupled with the outputs of the setar and garch models in fact the setar and garch models give the stochastic component of the hydrological data such as river flow comparing the performance statistics presented in tables 6 and 7 reveals that the developed hybrid models perform much better than the corresponding stand alone models it is clear that the rmse and mae statistical evaluation indicators of the stand alone models are considerably reduced by the proposed hybrid models moreover the values of r2 and e statistics are significantly improved by the developed hybrid models in comparison with the single models the performance comparison of hybrid models with each other shows that the ann setar mars setar and rf setar provide better results than the corresponding ann garch mars garch and rf garch for river flow modeling on the other hand the hybrid rf setar models generally offer the best performance among the developed hybrid models except for the rf1 setar in which the mars1 setar performed the best the statistical parameters obtained for the best hybrid models during the test period i e mars1 setar are rmse 4 07 m3 s mae 2 89 m3 s r2 0 991 and e 0 991 at brantford station as well as rmse 2 50 m3 s mae 1 79 m3 s r2 0 995 and e 0 994 at galt station performance evaluation of the stand alone and hybrid models illustrates that the stand alone setar and garch have higher accuracies than the stand alone ann mars and rf however the developed hybrid models outperform the stand alone time series and artificial intelligence models figs 7 9 demonstrate the scatter and time series plots of the observed against predicted river flow data for the superior hybrid and the relevant stand alone artificial intelligence models the bolded error values in the tables 6 and 7 represent the statistics of the best hybrid models at both stations over the test time period the fitted lines equations in the scatter plots are in the forms of y α 0 x α 1 in which y is the predicted river flow x is the observed river flow α0 is the slope and α 1 is the intercept the intercepts and slopes are closer to 0 and 1 respectively in the hybrid models than those obtained by the stand alone models the lower close to 0 and higher close to 1 values for the intercepts and slopes respectively can be attributed to the higher values for the r2 statistic as clearly seen from the scatter plots r2 ranged from 0 9754 in the ann1 setar to 0 9914 in the mars1 setar for brantford station as well as from 0 9797 in the ann1 setar to 0 9946 in the mars1 setar for galt station in addition the time series plots in figs 7 9 reveal that the predicted river flow data are closer to the observed data in the proposed hybrid models compared with the stand alone ones therefore it can be concluded that the actual fluctuations of river flow time series are well modeled by the hybrid models similar results reported by mehdizadeh et al 2017 2018 2019 mehdizadeh 2018 mehdizadeh and kozekalanai sales 2018 so that the hybrid models developed by the combination of artificial intelligence and time series approaches were much more precise in comparison with the single models for modeling the precipitation reference evapotranspiration and streamflow processes in general a much better performance of the proposed hybrid models can be justified considering the both stochastic and deterministic components of the monthly river flow in the modeling procedure it is worthy to mention that over fitting and curse of dimensionality are crucial problems in artificial intelligence modeling in hydrological science safari et al 2016 to this end there are number of issues that should be emphasized indeed well organized models using large number of data for modelling and existence of stopping criteria more importantly for ann prevent over fitting chang et al 2010 srivastava et al 2014 the over fitted models perform poorly in the tasting stage while the developed models in this study provide acceptable results on unseen data set at the testing stage on the other hand considering low number of weights with the use of low number of variables in the input of the models decrease the probability of the over fitting bishop 1995 as it given before one three input variables are considered in this study moreover for the case of mars technique because of its forward and backward stepwise unessential variables are removed to prevent over fitting of the model and increase the model performance friedman 1991 sharda et al 2008 safari 2019 for the case of rf over fitting problem is prevented through its randomness feature sadler et al 2018 ann model is much less susceptible to the curse of dimensionality bishop 1995 finally as developed models are well organized with large number of data using reliable techniques it can be said that the developed models in this study were not expected to have such a problem 3 2 performance evaluation of the models in predicting extreme values of the monthly river flow data having information on the extreme amounts of river flow including peak and low values has a key role in the management of water resources projects and optimal future decisions furthermore the analysis of extreme flows is of particular importance in problems related to water resources management such as dam spillway and sluiceway operations as well as reservoir operation during the drought periods sanikhani and kisi 2012 awchi 2014 therefore in this section the capabilities of the stand alone and proposed hybrid models were evaluated in predicting peak and low values of river flow data for this aim the observed and predicted peak and low values of the monthly river flow data were considered during the test period it should be noted that the observed river flow values greater than 150 m3 s and 120 m3 s were considered as the peaks of the flow data at brantford and galt stations respectively moreover flow rates lower than 19 0 m3 s and 12 5 m3 s were chosen as benchmarks at brantford and galt stations respectively to investigate the performance of stand alone and hybrid models for estimation of low values of the monthly river flow data comparison of the applied models in predicting peak and low values of the monthly river flow data are made respectively in figs 10 and 11 as seen in fig 10 the single ann mars and rf are not able to predict peak points of the river flow time series at the studied stations peak points are under predicted by the stand alone models whereas the developed hybrid models can accurately predict peak points of the river flow data besides as obviously seen in fig 11 low points of the monthly river flow data are over predicted by the stand alone models nevertheless these extreme values can well be modeled in the hybrid models proposed in the present study in comparison with the single ones as a result the obtained outcomes confirm that the river flow time series predicted by the developed hybrid models are closely matched to the observed data due to considering the both stochastic and deterministic components 4 conclusions in the present study an attempt was made to improve the prediction accuracy of monthly river flow at brantford and galt stations situated on grand river canada for this purpose the various artificial intelligence approaches including ann mars and rf models were coupled with the setar and garch time series ones the acquired results denoted that the hybrid models namely ann setar mars setar rf setar ann garch mars garch and rf garch outperformed the stand alone ann mars rf setar and garch nevertheless the rf setar generally presented the better performance compared with the ann setar and mars setar at both stations the most accurate models among the developed hybrid models of test phase were mars1 setar for both of the considered stations error statistics of the rmse mae r2 and e obtained for the mentioned model were 4 07 m3 s 2 89 m3 s 0 991 and 0 991 at brantford station table 6 as well as 2 50 m3 s 1 79 m3 s 0 995 and 0 994 for galt station table 7 additionally the performance of the developed and stand alone models was investigated for the prediction of extreme values of the monthly river flows it was concluded that the proposed hybrid models had much better accuracies in predicting the peak and low points of river flows compared with the stand alone ones thus as a general conclusion it can be presented that the hybrid models developed in this study can be considered as alternative approaches to the stand alone artificial intelligence models for precise prediction of the monthly river flow additionally it is suggested that the methodology presented in this study can be used in the future works related to the modeling of other hydrological processes such as rainfall rainfall runoff etc declaration of competing interest the authors declare that there is no conflict of interest acknowledgments the authors would like to acknowledge prof geoff syme editor in chief and two anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments that helped us to improve the quality of the paper 
6408,prediction of river flow as a fundamental source of hydrological information plays a crucial role in various fields of water projects in this study at first the capabilities of two time series analysis approaches namely self exciting threshold autoregressive setar and generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity garch models then three artificial intelligence approaches including artificial neural networks ann multivariate adaptive regression splines mars and random forests rf models were investigated to predict monthly river flow for this purpose monthly river flow data of brantford and galt stations on grand river canada for the period from october 1948 to september 2017 were used and their performances were evaluated based on various evaluation criteria the setar model showed better performance than the garch one in prediction of river flows at the stations of study additionally the stand alone mars and rf models performed slightly better than the ann next hybrid models were developed by coupling the used ann mars and rf models with setar and garch models as the non linear time series models the performance of various models presented in this study indicated that the new hybrid models demonstrated a much better performance compared with the stand alone ones at both stations among the developed hybrid models the rf setar models generally had the best accuracy to improve the river flows modeling as a result it can be concluded that the presented methodology can be used to predict hydrological time series such as river flow with a high level of accuracy keywords ann mars rf setar garch monthly river flow canada 1 introduction an accurate estimation of river flows in watersheds and water resources systems plays a major role for more timely and efficient management of water projects furthermore having information on the river flows is needed to manage rivers flood warning systems and especially planning for optimal operations river flow modeling seems to be a complex process due to the impacts of hydro climatic variables such as evaporation temperature precipitation etc on river flow there are commonly two approaches in estimation of river flows which can be classified in two groups of physically based or conceptual and mathematically based or data driven models gershenfeld and weigend 1994 peueot et al 2003 babovic 2005 di et al 2014 he et al 2014 zhang et al 2016 the physically based models are complex and need complicated mathematical tools sufficient physical data and some extent of expertise and experience with the models that impede the application of these types of models aqil et al 2007 he et al 2014 while data driven models are simpler to implement not so complex and they do not require any information on the physical nature of hydrological processes as these models are popular and commonly used for modeling hydrological processes therefore they can be helpful and valuable for modeling river flows chau et al 2005 nayak et al 2005 wu et al 2009 he et al 2014 artificial intelligence approaches as one of the data driven models are able to model hydrological processes using only a series of input data although they may have some disadvantages for example they do not include any physical parameters additionally non considering the stochastic component of hydrological variables along with the deterministic component obtained by these models can be another disadvantage of these methods accordingly it seems that the use of these models alone cannot be an appropriate approach in modeling the hydrologic time series in such circumstances artificial intelligence models coupled with the time series models can be taken into account for hydrological processes instead of using single models during recent decades artificial intelligence models have being extensively applied to predict hydrologic time series such as streamflow artificial neural networks ann multivariate adaptive regression splines mars and random forests rf are three kinds of these models yu et al 2004 introduced a hybrid model by combining the chaos theory and support vector machine svm namely ec svm for daily runoff forecasting of tryggevælde catchment denmark and the mississippi river at vicksburg the proposed ec svm hybrid model was found to be better than other methods used including standard chaos naive inverse and autoregressive integrated moving average arima kisi and cimen 2011 evaluated the performance of wavelet support vector regression w svr and single svr for monthly streamflow prediction at canakdere and goksudere rivers turkey the results revealed that the proposed w svr presented better performance than the stand alone svr to predict streamflow samsudin et al 2011 predicted monthly river flow of selangor and bernam rivers malaysia using group method of data handling gmdh coupled with the least squares support vector machine lssvm named as glssvm single gmdh and lssvm as well as ann and arima models it was concluded that the new hybrid model i e glssvm had the best accuracy in comparison with the other models sanikhani and kisi 2012 employed two different types of adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system anfis namely grid partitioning anfis gp and subtractive clustering anfis sc for modeling monthly river flow at garzan and bitlis streams turkey the results of this study uncovered that the anfis sc outperformed the anfis gp kalteh 2013 used the ann and svr techniques combined with wavelet transform for predicting monthly river flow of kharjegil and ponel stations iran the results showed that the single svr had slightly better accuracy compared with the single ann awchi 2014 forecasted monthly river discharge of bakhma and dokan sites on the upper and lower zab river in northern iraq respectively using feed forward neural networks ffnn generalized regression neural networks grnn radial basis function neural networks rbfnn and multiple linear regression mlr it was found that the ffnn outperformed the other used models terzi and ergin 2014 employed autoregressive ar time series model as well as gene expression programming gep rbfnn ffnn and anfis for predicting monthly river flow of kızılırmak river turkey they reported that the ar model performed the best in addition the gep and anfis had higher accuracy than the rbfnn and ffnn zhang et al 2016 introduced a hybrid model namely ceref which is an integration of empirical mode decomposition emd rbfnn and external forces ef variable they concluded that the suggested ceref model can be considered as a suitable and alternative approach to predict annual streamflow of wuding river basin yaseen et al 2016a conducted a comparative study among extreme learning machine elm grnn and svr for monthly streamflow prediction in the tigris river iraq the elm model was found to be better than the svr and grnn ones ghorbani et al 2016a predicted monthly river flow of some hydrometric stations on zarrinehrud river iran using multilayer perceptron mlp svm and rbfnn the results showed that the predictions of rbfnn and mlp were better than the svm the forecasting performance of ffnn and rbfnn models were assessed by yaseen et al 2016b for daily river flow at johor river malaysia the superiority of the rbfnn over the ffnn was reported in this study ghorbani et al 2016b modeled daily river discharge by the svm ann conventional mlr and rating curve rc approaches for big cypress river texas usa performance evaluation of models revealed that peak values of river discharge modeled by the ann and svm models were more accurate than those obtained by the mlr and rc ravansalar et al 2017 introduced wavelet linear genetic programming w lgp to model the monthly streamflow at pataveh and shahmokhtar stations located on beshar river iran furthermore the w lgp model performance was evaluated in comparison with the single ann lgp wavelet ann w ann and mlr the results revealed that the proposed w lgp model had the highest accuracy at the studied regions moeeni et al 2017 used seasonal arima i e sarima integrated with anfis and ann methods for monthly inflow prediction the results presented that the hybrid sarima anfis model is the superior model among all fathian et al 2019 employed the multiple linear var vector auto regressive and nonlinear dvech diagonal vectorization heteroscedasticity time series models in modeling daily streamflow process the results demonstrated that the hybrid var dvech has better performance than the var model some of detailed information on previous studies reviewed in this study is summarized in table 1 among many time series models developed for modeling hydrological time series two models namely setar self exciting threshold autoregressive and garch generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity were used in the present study these models are as the new non linear types of time series models which have not widely been used to modeling hydrological processes komorník et al 2006 modarres and ouarda 2013 this research attempts to predict monthly river flow of brantford and galt stations situated on grand river canada in this regard the aims of this study are 1 to assess the accuracy of the stand alone setar garch ann mars and rf models for predicting monthly river flow 2 to develop hybrid models by coupling the ann mars and rf models with setar and garch models and 3 to compare the accuracy of river flow modeling by the hybrid models proposed in this study with the stand alone ones it can be noted that the hydrological time series like river flow is comprised of stochastic and deterministic components it is worthwhile to be expressed that according to the authors knowledge the stochastic component of river flow has not usually been considered in the previous studies through the non linear time series models however in this study the stochastic components of river flow data were considered in the modeling procedure on the other hand recent works on modeling the hydrological variables such as river flow have focused on the separate application of artificial intelligence and time series models however the use of artificial intelligence models is more than the time series models in hydrological modeling in contrast the application of hybrid artificial intelligence time series models in literature for hydrological parameters modeling is significantly less than for the stand alone artificial intelligence and time series models besides few studies have been reported in literature to consider the stochastic behavior of river flow in modeling procedure by the time series models in coupled with the artificial intelligence techniques through the hybrid artificial intelligence time series models therefore this study as an innovation investigates the abilities of the ann mars and rf models coupled with the non linear setar and garch time series models in predicting monthly river flow 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data used the present study was carried out for two hydrometric stations namely brantford and galt situated on grand river in canada the grand river as a large river in southwestern ontario canada with length of 280 km is entirely within southern ontario s boundaries and it flows southwards to lake erie https www grandriver ca en index aspx the geographical location of study area is demonstrated in fig 1 the monthly river flow data were acquired from the official website of the government of canada https wateroffice ec gc ca with the length of 828 monthly data from october 1948 to september 2017 in order to train the models the first 588 data about 71 of the total data of river flow time series from october 1948 to september 1997 for each station was used in addition the data between october 1997 and september 2017 240 months about 29 of the total data were employed in test stage fig 2 illustrates the observation time series plot of monthly river flow data for both stations throughout the studied period the statistical properties of the river flow time series are presented in table 2 as clear generally similar statistical parameters are observed for both train and test periods it is better to mention that the observed river flow time series must be standardized due to the use of time series models i e setar and garch for predicting river flows as well as to eliminate the dimension of observational river flow datasets herein whole monthly river flow datasets of the studied stations were standardized through the following equation 1 q s q o q o σ q o where qs qo q o and σ q o denote the standardized river flow data observed river flow data the mean of observed data and the standard deviation of observed data respectively mehdizadeh et al 2019 2 2 ann model the ann is the biologically inspired approach which is widely used to estimate complex and non linear systems in the ann the relationships between input and output variables are simulated by inspiration from the human brain features in general an ann model is composed of three layers and as an example the structure of the ann model used in the present study is illustrated in fig 3 the first layer is the input layer that receives the input information the hidden layer is the information processing sector the last layer is the output layer that receives the processed information from the previous layer and then gives the final output moreover each layer consists of processor units called neurons the general form of an ann can be expressed as 2 y f i 1 n x i w i b i where y is the output xi denotes the input vector i 1 2 n wi is the weight vector bi is the bias and f is the transfer activation function in this research in order to predict the river flow data feed forward back propagation neural networks having three layer were applied input layer is composed of different combinations of lagged monthly river flow data see table 3 the same input and output variables were considered for the mars and rf models the hidden layer plays a significant role to achieve high performance by the ann therefore using trial and error method the optimal numbers of neurons were acquired for the hidden layer training the ann is in fact to adjust the values of network parameters consisting of weights between input and hidden layers as well as between hidden and output layers and biases between the hidden and output layers moreover the functions used in the hidden and output layers were respectively tangent sigmoid and linear transfer functions 2 3 mars model the mars as a non parametric regression approach was presented by friedman 1991 to reveal hidden non linear pattern in datasets with a large number of variables this model is based on functions named basis functions which are defined as follows 3 max 0 x c max 0 c x where x is the input and c is a constant which is called knot these basis functions eq 3 are known as spline functions being in fact a reflected pair at c knot fig 4 the general form of the mars can be defined as below 4 y f x c 0 i 1 m c i b i x where y is the dependent variable estimated by the mars co is a constant b i x is the ith basis function and ci is the coefficient of ith basis function where all ci coefficients are determined by minimizing the sum of square errors fitting the mars model is executed in two stages consisting of forward and backward stages in the forward stage a large number of basis functions with different knots are consecutively added to the model and an over fitted and complex model is created in the backward stage the basis functions which may have less impact on the estimation process are pruned by the mars finally the optimum mars model is chosen based on the lowest value of generalized cross validation gcv criterion gcv can be expressed as 5 gcv m 1 n i 1 n y i f x i 2 1 c m n 2 where y i is the target output f xi is the estimated output n is the number of dataset and c m is a penalty which is defined as 6 c m m 1 d m where m is the number of basis functions and d is a penalty for each basis function involved in the model 2 4 rf model the rf as a powerful ensemble learning algorithm was first introduced by breiman 2001 which is used for regression analysis classification and unsupervised learning purposes liaw and wiener 2002 the rf algorithm with the permutation and continuous change of the factors affecting the target variable leads to the creation of a large number of decision trees and then all the trees are combined for the prediction fig 5 illustrates a general structure of rf technique as the number of trees increases the over fitting effect that occurs in the decision tree method is eliminated thus at each stage of tree growth the model is more precise and the error rate decreases the bagging procedure is applied in the rf to choose the random samples of parameters as the training dataset then for each variable the function establishes model prediction error if the values of that variable are permuted across the out of bag observations trigila et al 2015 several bootstrap samples of the data are involved in the rf construction the bootstrap method is a sampling method with permutation thus by repeating the sampling operation some out of bags datasets are created from the training dataset out of bag predictions are one of the main functions in tuning of the rf for evaluation and generate much faster results in comparison with other methods probst et al 2019 the number of trees ntree is the most important feature of the model that can affect the performance of rf modeling which is considered as ntree 500 furthermore the number of variables on each node i e mtry is another user defined parameter of rf implementation here mtry 1 was applied in modeling process testing more numbers for trees and variables on each node revealed that ntree 500 and mtry 1 showed relatively better results 2 5 setar model one of the non linear time series model groups is the threshold auto regressive tar models which are called as a group of non linear regime switching approaches in these types of non linear time series models the time series characteristics consisting of mean variance and autocorrelation differ in various regimes cryer and chan 2008 tsay 2010 one of the special cases of the non linear tar model is the setar model tong 1983 used in the present study on the basis of tar based models structure a parameter called threshold determines the movements of each time series between regimes the threshold parameter for the setar models can be either a given value of the time series used in modeling procedure or a parameter that is determined by an algorithm komorník et al 2006 if we consider y1 yn as the time series dataset for modeling we can define a two regime setar model shown as setar p r cryer and chan 2008 as 7 y t φ 0 1 i 1 p φ i 1 y t i ε t 1 i f y t d τ φ 0 2 i 1 r φ i 2 y t i ε t 2 i f y t d τ where n is the length of the time series and φ i j i 1 2 p i 1 2 r j 1 2 are the ar models coefficients the orders of the lower and upper regimes of the ar models are denoted as p and r respectively d is as a delay time τ is the threshold amount or transition parameter ε t is the residual time series at time t ε t ñ 0 σ 2 tsay 2010 at the first step in modeling procedure of a two regime setar time series model both the threshold value τ and the lag time parameter d should be determined the time series dataset according to the defined limit of each regime y t d τ or not can be divided into two parts so that the data that are smaller or larger than the threshold values are discerned finally for each regime the same ar model is fitted to each time series dataset detected according to the threshold parameter by minimizing the akaike information criterion aic for a fixed τ and d the orders of the ar model are obtained cryer and chan 2008 as 8 aic p r τ d 2 l τ d 2 p r 2 l τ d n p 2 1 log 2 π n 1 τ d 2 log σ 1 τ d 2 n 2 τ d 2 log σ 2 τ d 2 in this equation l τ d is the log likelihood function that is used to estimate τ and d the number of observations in each regime are n 1 and n 2 as well as error variances in the lower and upper regimes are σ 1 and σ 2 respectively cryer and chan 2008 2 6 garch model the garch approach as a non linear time series model was first suggested by engle 1982 and then extended by bollerslev 1986 to model volatility or conditional variance of a univariate time series in this approach it is assumed that the obtained residual time series from the model fitted to hydrological time series are dependent upon time in such conditions it is expected that variance is not constant over time conditional time variant variance so that the arch efficacy exists in the residuals in fact the garch approach can describe the trends of conditional variance according to the information of past events the general structure of a garch model can be written as 9 σ t 2 v a r ε t ε u u t ω i 1 v α i ε t i 2 j 1 m β j σ t j 2 10 ε t σ t e t e t normal 0 1 ε t ψ t 1 normal 0 σ t 2 where σ t 2 v a r ε t ε u u t is the conditional heteroscedasticity of the residuals ω is a constant α 1 α v and β 1 β m are the garch model s coefficients as well as the orders of the model s coefficients are v and m as seen in the garch model formula σ t 2 value depends on the v past squared residual time series and the m lagged conditional variance it should be noted that if m 0 garch v m arch v the aic and maximum likelihood estimation mle techniques are used to identify the garch model orders and the model s parameters cryer and chan 2008 2 7 coupling the ann mars and rf with setar and garch models as mentioned the main aim of this study is to improve the accuracy of monthly river flow modeling using the ann mars and rf methods coupled with setar and garch time series models accordingly the following steps were followed 1 the deterministic component of the monthly river flow data was predicted using the stand alone ann mars and rf models 2 the optimal setar models were fitted to the standardized monthly river flow time series of the two stations to obtain ε t values 3 the optimum garch model was fitted to the ε t 2 values obtained from each setar model in the previous step 4 the deterministic component dt of river flow data by the stand alone ann mars and rf models was coupled and combined with the stochastic component st obtained from the setar and garch models as below 11 y t d t s t 5 the final step was to scale up the obtained yt values by de standardization procedure 2 8 evaluation criteria the performance of stand alone ann mars rf setar garch and hybrid ann setar mars setar rf setar ann garch mars garch and rf garch models was evaluated for predicting the monthly river flow data based on four statistical evaluation indicators these evaluation criteria include root mean square error rmse mean absolute error mae coefficient of determination r2 and nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient e proposed by nash and sutcliffe 1970 these indicators can be defined as 12 rmse i 1 n q o i q p i 2 n 13 mae i 1 n q o i q p i n 14 r 2 i 1 n q o i q o q p i q p i 1 n q o i q o 2 i 1 n q p i q p 2 2 15 e 1 i 1 n q o i q p i 2 i 1 n q o i q o 2 where qo i and qp i are respectively the ith observed and predicted monthly river flow q o is the mean of observed monthly river flow data q p is the mean of predicted monthly river flow data and n is the number of data in each studied dataset 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance evaluation of the stand alone and developed hybrid models the results of fitting the setar and garch time series models indicated that setar 1 1 and garch 1 0 are the optimal models fitted to the streamflow datasets of the studied areas equations of the optimum setar and garch models fitted to both of stations are presented in table 4 table 5 also illustrates the values of statistical parameters calculated for the optimal setar and garch time series models for both train and test periods as seen the setar models developed at brantford and galt stations give better accuracies than the garch ones error indicators of the setar models obtained for the test stage are as rmse 14 13 m3 s mae 10 64 m3 s r2 0 895 e 0 894 at brantford station and rmse 10 25 m3 s mae 7 59 m3 s r2 0 895 e 0 894 at galt one as previously mentioned in table 3 one to three months lagged river flow data in the form of standardized was applied as inputs of the artificial intelligence techniques these lags were selected based on the auto correlation functions acf graphs of the standardized data as clearly seen in fig 6 the first three time lags i e qt 1 to qt 3 demonstrate significant effect on qt the acf values of other lags are within the confidence intervals hence the first three lags were employed as the inputs in modeling procedure as noted the performance of ann is affected by the number of neurons in the hidden layer various trial and errors for the number of neurons in the hidden layer revealed that their optimal numbers at brantford station were 2 2 and 1 for the ann1 ann2 and ann3 respectively moreover the optimal numbers of neurons in the hidden layer at galt station were 3 2 and 1 respectively for the ann1 ann2 and ann3 for example the structure of ann2 at brantford and galt stations is 2 2 1 which means that the developed ann respectively contains two two and one neurons in the input hidden and output layers see fig 3 performance evaluation of the stand alone ann mars and rf models and their corresponding hybrid models with setar and garch models are listed in tables 6 and 7 for both train and test stages at brantford and galt stations respectively it is obvious from the tables that there are slight differences between the performance of the stand alone ann mars and rf models in the scenarios considered for predicting the monthly river flow however the mars and rf models perform slightly better than the ann at both stations for the scenarios with similar inputs in the second part of current research the results obtained from the stand alone ann mars and rf models including the deterministic component of the monthly river flow data were coupled with the outputs of the setar and garch models in fact the setar and garch models give the stochastic component of the hydrological data such as river flow comparing the performance statistics presented in tables 6 and 7 reveals that the developed hybrid models perform much better than the corresponding stand alone models it is clear that the rmse and mae statistical evaluation indicators of the stand alone models are considerably reduced by the proposed hybrid models moreover the values of r2 and e statistics are significantly improved by the developed hybrid models in comparison with the single models the performance comparison of hybrid models with each other shows that the ann setar mars setar and rf setar provide better results than the corresponding ann garch mars garch and rf garch for river flow modeling on the other hand the hybrid rf setar models generally offer the best performance among the developed hybrid models except for the rf1 setar in which the mars1 setar performed the best the statistical parameters obtained for the best hybrid models during the test period i e mars1 setar are rmse 4 07 m3 s mae 2 89 m3 s r2 0 991 and e 0 991 at brantford station as well as rmse 2 50 m3 s mae 1 79 m3 s r2 0 995 and e 0 994 at galt station performance evaluation of the stand alone and hybrid models illustrates that the stand alone setar and garch have higher accuracies than the stand alone ann mars and rf however the developed hybrid models outperform the stand alone time series and artificial intelligence models figs 7 9 demonstrate the scatter and time series plots of the observed against predicted river flow data for the superior hybrid and the relevant stand alone artificial intelligence models the bolded error values in the tables 6 and 7 represent the statistics of the best hybrid models at both stations over the test time period the fitted lines equations in the scatter plots are in the forms of y α 0 x α 1 in which y is the predicted river flow x is the observed river flow α0 is the slope and α 1 is the intercept the intercepts and slopes are closer to 0 and 1 respectively in the hybrid models than those obtained by the stand alone models the lower close to 0 and higher close to 1 values for the intercepts and slopes respectively can be attributed to the higher values for the r2 statistic as clearly seen from the scatter plots r2 ranged from 0 9754 in the ann1 setar to 0 9914 in the mars1 setar for brantford station as well as from 0 9797 in the ann1 setar to 0 9946 in the mars1 setar for galt station in addition the time series plots in figs 7 9 reveal that the predicted river flow data are closer to the observed data in the proposed hybrid models compared with the stand alone ones therefore it can be concluded that the actual fluctuations of river flow time series are well modeled by the hybrid models similar results reported by mehdizadeh et al 2017 2018 2019 mehdizadeh 2018 mehdizadeh and kozekalanai sales 2018 so that the hybrid models developed by the combination of artificial intelligence and time series approaches were much more precise in comparison with the single models for modeling the precipitation reference evapotranspiration and streamflow processes in general a much better performance of the proposed hybrid models can be justified considering the both stochastic and deterministic components of the monthly river flow in the modeling procedure it is worthy to mention that over fitting and curse of dimensionality are crucial problems in artificial intelligence modeling in hydrological science safari et al 2016 to this end there are number of issues that should be emphasized indeed well organized models using large number of data for modelling and existence of stopping criteria more importantly for ann prevent over fitting chang et al 2010 srivastava et al 2014 the over fitted models perform poorly in the tasting stage while the developed models in this study provide acceptable results on unseen data set at the testing stage on the other hand considering low number of weights with the use of low number of variables in the input of the models decrease the probability of the over fitting bishop 1995 as it given before one three input variables are considered in this study moreover for the case of mars technique because of its forward and backward stepwise unessential variables are removed to prevent over fitting of the model and increase the model performance friedman 1991 sharda et al 2008 safari 2019 for the case of rf over fitting problem is prevented through its randomness feature sadler et al 2018 ann model is much less susceptible to the curse of dimensionality bishop 1995 finally as developed models are well organized with large number of data using reliable techniques it can be said that the developed models in this study were not expected to have such a problem 3 2 performance evaluation of the models in predicting extreme values of the monthly river flow data having information on the extreme amounts of river flow including peak and low values has a key role in the management of water resources projects and optimal future decisions furthermore the analysis of extreme flows is of particular importance in problems related to water resources management such as dam spillway and sluiceway operations as well as reservoir operation during the drought periods sanikhani and kisi 2012 awchi 2014 therefore in this section the capabilities of the stand alone and proposed hybrid models were evaluated in predicting peak and low values of river flow data for this aim the observed and predicted peak and low values of the monthly river flow data were considered during the test period it should be noted that the observed river flow values greater than 150 m3 s and 120 m3 s were considered as the peaks of the flow data at brantford and galt stations respectively moreover flow rates lower than 19 0 m3 s and 12 5 m3 s were chosen as benchmarks at brantford and galt stations respectively to investigate the performance of stand alone and hybrid models for estimation of low values of the monthly river flow data comparison of the applied models in predicting peak and low values of the monthly river flow data are made respectively in figs 10 and 11 as seen in fig 10 the single ann mars and rf are not able to predict peak points of the river flow time series at the studied stations peak points are under predicted by the stand alone models whereas the developed hybrid models can accurately predict peak points of the river flow data besides as obviously seen in fig 11 low points of the monthly river flow data are over predicted by the stand alone models nevertheless these extreme values can well be modeled in the hybrid models proposed in the present study in comparison with the single ones as a result the obtained outcomes confirm that the river flow time series predicted by the developed hybrid models are closely matched to the observed data due to considering the both stochastic and deterministic components 4 conclusions in the present study an attempt was made to improve the prediction accuracy of monthly river flow at brantford and galt stations situated on grand river canada for this purpose the various artificial intelligence approaches including ann mars and rf models were coupled with the setar and garch time series ones the acquired results denoted that the hybrid models namely ann setar mars setar rf setar ann garch mars garch and rf garch outperformed the stand alone ann mars rf setar and garch nevertheless the rf setar generally presented the better performance compared with the ann setar and mars setar at both stations the most accurate models among the developed hybrid models of test phase were mars1 setar for both of the considered stations error statistics of the rmse mae r2 and e obtained for the mentioned model were 4 07 m3 s 2 89 m3 s 0 991 and 0 991 at brantford station table 6 as well as 2 50 m3 s 1 79 m3 s 0 995 and 0 994 for galt station table 7 additionally the performance of the developed and stand alone models was investigated for the prediction of extreme values of the monthly river flows it was concluded that the proposed hybrid models had much better accuracies in predicting the peak and low points of river flows compared with the stand alone ones thus as a general conclusion it can be presented that the hybrid models developed in this study can be considered as alternative approaches to the stand alone artificial intelligence models for precise prediction of the monthly river flow additionally it is suggested that the methodology presented in this study can be used in the future works related to the modeling of other hydrological processes such as rainfall rainfall runoff etc declaration of competing interest the authors declare that there is no conflict of interest acknowledgments the authors would like to acknowledge prof geoff syme editor in chief and two anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments that helped us to improve the quality of the paper 
6409,the alpine region is a particularly sensitive environment rich in water resources nurturing delicate freshwater ecosystems which are however threatened by intensive exploitation for hydropower production and irrigated agriculture the impact of water uses on the hydrological cycle is intimately intertwined with changes of the climatic forcing which operate over a wide range of temporal and spatial scales in the present study historical time series of streamflow precipitation and temperature recorded in the adige river basin a large alpine watershed in northeastern italy are analyzed in order to quantify alterations of the main hydrological fluxes due to changes in climate and water uses spatial and temporal patterns of change are detected by comparing annual and seasonal components of the water budget performed in four representative sub catchments with size ranging from 207 to 9 852 km2 characterized by different climatic and water use conditions afterwards a multi method approach is applied for attributing the observed changes to their main drivers summer streamflow depletion affects the adige lowlands since the 70s which is attributed to both the reduction of winter precipitation and the development of irrigated agriculture conversely winter streamflow increased in headwater catchments due to the increase of aquifers recharge in autumn which is consistent with the increase of precipitation in the same period these results reveal that the impact of climate change on the adige basin is multifaceted scale dependent and intertwined with the effects of changes in water resources exploitation keywords trend detection trend attribution climate change anthropogenic impact water budget hydrological alterations 1 introduction the relevant role of climate change on the observed alterations of the water cycle in snow dominated regions is widely recognized particularly in the european alps see e g beniston 2003 barnett et al 2005 coppola and giorgi 2010 finger et al 2012 gobiet et al 2014 gampe et al 2016 majone et al 2016 pagán et al 2016 a number of contributions suggest that recent changes in precipitation patterns and the contemporaneous rise of temperature have led to rapid glaciers melting and intensification of evaporation with a consequent alteration of the typical alpine hydrological regime see e g birsan et al 2005 kormann et al 2015 this notwithstanding the impact of climate change on water resources and freshwater ecosystem functioning has been observed to be much weaker than in other mediterranean river basins see e g lutz et al 2016 diamantini et al 2018 in addition anthropogenic pressure factors such as land use changes hydropower and agricultural developments and increasing population have been shown to drive important streamflow alterations in alpine catchments see e g long 1987 zolezzi et al 2009 zolezzi et al 2011 chiogna et al 2016 and their influence should be carefully quantified and separated from the climatic one disentangling climatic and anthropogenic impacts on hydrological fluxes is however a challenging task since they combine in a complex nonlinear manner recent studies attempted to use satellite products to perform such partitioning e g douglas et al 2006 loarie et al 2011 though these analyses are limited by the relatively short time span in which such products are available other studies addressed this issue through water balance often coupled with modeling whose accuracy depends on the availability and quality of hydro climatic and land use data see e g zhang et al 2008 tomer and schilling 2009 destouni et al 2013 jaramillo et al 2013 renner et al 2014 levi et al 2015 abera et al 2017 currently most of the available studies focus on the attribution of flood changes see e g merz et al 2012 hall et al 2014 viglione et al 2016 whereas hydrological alterations are less studied see e g long 1987 harrigan et al 2014 duethmann et al 2015 despite a systematic spatially distributed hydrological monitoring is active since the beginning of the past century in the alpine region several studies analyzed trends in streamflow see e g chiew and mcmahon 1996 burn and elnur 2002 birsan et al 2005 bard et al 2015 precipitation see e g brunetti et al 2006 and temperature see e g weber et al 1997 separately without assessing their interplay and the consequences on water budget dynamics the compelling need of assessing the multiple and concurring causes of streamflow alterations observed in the alpine region especially in the recent decades when these changes became more evident was highlighted by birsan et al 2005 a similar conclusion was drawn by kormann et al 2015 who specified that an integrated approach is desirable since available studies in alpine catchments focus on the trends of single drivers of change furthermore bocchiola 2014 highlighted the importance of improving our understanding of the hydrological budget in alpine catchments to unravel the processes controlling the observed patterns of variation moving from the identification of changes in flood magnitude and frequency see e g hodgkins et al 2017 to a deep understanding and quantification of the processes driving the observed alterations of the hydrological cycle is a thorny problem because large uncertainties plague hydrological modeling while observational data are often incomplete and affected by measurement errors serinaldi et al 2018 recently merz et al 2012 proposed a rigorous framework for trend attribution on floods which is based on three main steps 1 evidence of consistency 2 evidence of inconsistency and 3 provision of a confidence level steps 1 and 2 can be performed with inferential statistics techniques such as optimal fingerprinting see e g hasselmann 1997 allen and stott 2003 for example this technique has been widely used in the context of climate change detection and attribution and is based on a multivariate regression approach in which the analyzed time series are represented as a linear combination of signal patterns i e fingerprints when applied to hydrological fluxes this approach requires a comprehensive monitoring of hydrological variables well beyond what is commonly available from standard environmental monitoring by river authorities harrigan et al 2014 when necessary kundzewicz and robson 2004 suggest to consider also related variables i e proxies to increase the amount of information used in the analysis for instance a proxy of glacier melting could be the period with air temperature higher than zero above a certain elevation focusing on the alpine region most of the studies indicated the rising temperature as the principal cause of the observed increase of winter and contemporaneous reduction of summer streamflows the former caused by a shift of winter precipitation from snow to rain and the latter by an increased summer evapotranspiration see e g scherrer and appenzeller 2004 barnett et al 2005 birsan et al 2005 bocchiola 2014 here we explored alternative hypotheses by employing a multi method approach in which inferential statistics techniques were used for a rigorous identification of the drivers of hydrological changes in the adige river basin a large alpine catchment in northeastern italy this objective was pursued by analyzing changes of hydrological variables in nested catchments of size ranging from 207 km2 to 9 852 km2 within the adige river basin in particular trend analysis see e g mann 1945 kendall 1975 hirsch et al 1982 was applied to hydro meteorological variables aggregated at the sub catchment scale and the comparison among observed changes allowed to detect spatial patterns of change and to identify the associated local drivers effects on streamflow in addition since the temporal patterns of precipitation and temperature are important determinants of the water budget long 1987 seasonal analysis was also performed in order to detect intra annual variations of the hydrological fluxes and to attribute them to season specific drivers temporal and spatial variability was explored at the finer scale that the measurements allowed by using daily data interpolated at a 1 km2 grid resolution furthermore correlation and multi regressive analyses were performed to identify relationships between changes in streamflow and possible concurrent drivers see e g huo et al 2008 harrigan et al 2014 the paper is organized as follows section 2 presents a short description of the study area and of the available hydro climatic data 2 1 and introduces the methods adopted for the analysis 2 2 2 3 2 4 2 5 results of trend analysis are presented in section 3 in section 4 the detected trends are attributed to relevant drivers finally discussion and conclusions are provided in section 5 2 material and methods 2 1 data we analyzed long term time series of hydrological data in the adige river basin a large alpine catchment located in southeastern alps north east of italy fig 1 the adige river rises at the resia pass 46 50 04 2 n 10 30 58 32 e and flows eastward to the city of bolzano and then south to the city of verona before turning to east again finally reaching the adriatic sea at rosolina a mare 45 09 44 64 n 12 19 47 64 e with a total water course of 420 km the long term average streamflow at the gauging station of boara pisani 52 km upstream the river mouth is of 202 m3s 1 which considering the contributing area of 11 738 km2 leads to a specific discharge of 17 21 l s 1 km 2 streamflow reaches its minimum in winter when precipitation within the catchment is at its seasonal minimum and chiefly as snow in the headwaters followed by a first maximum in early summer due to snow melting and a second one in autumn caused by intense cyclonic storms summers are typically wet and dominated by short and intense convective storms the annual average precipitation ranges from 500 mm in the north west to 1 600 mm in the southern part of the basin due to the wide elevation gradient and the humid climate the basin is well suited for hydropower exploitation which represents the dominant water use and the major cause of alteration of the natural hydrological regime in the catchment the majority of hydropower production is performed by 34 large hydropower plants with a total nominal power of 650 mw autorità di bacino del fiume adige 2008 chiogna et al 2016 we performed a detailed analysis of hydrological fluxes in the following four sub catchments of the adige river basin characterized by different climatic and water use conditions see fig 1 adige at the gauging stations of trento and bronzolo both located along the main stem the other two selected catchments are gadera at mantana and avisio at soraga both are headwaters and are located in the northeastern and southeastern part of the adige watershed respectively in the following for brevity we will refer to these catchments as trento bronzolo mantana and soraga respectively main hydro meteorological characteristics of the sub catchments are reported in table 1 time series of precipitation and air temperature were obtained from the meteorological offices of the provinces of trento meteotrentino http www meteotrentino it and bolzano http www provincia bz it meteo home as and the austrian weather service zamg http www zamg ac at air temperature daily average as well as maximum and minimum and daily precipitation data were available from 350 and 244 stations respectively since 1920 fig 2 shows both the locations panel a and the temporal availability panel b of the meteorological stations used in the present work notice that meteorological stations located outside the adige catchment were also used fig 2a in order to improve the estimates of precipitation and temperature fields at the catchment boundaries furthermore fig 2b highlights that the number of simultaneously active temperature stations during the investigation period 1956 2013 increased from 64 to 261 whereas precipitation stations increased from 125 to 190 during the period 1956 2000 and then decreased to 106 in 2013 as a consequence of the decommissioning of obsolete installations the impact on the results of changes in the number of active meteorological stations is discussed in details in section 3 1 daily streamflow data measured at the four selected gauging stations were provided by the hydrological offices of the autonomous provinces of trento http www floods it public and bolzano http www provincia bz it hydro these time series extend almost continuously over the period 1956 2013 with a very limited number of gaps and refer to sections with stable riverbeds where the rating curves were controlled periodically or did not change significantly during the recording period all the streamflow data used in the present work are official measurements by the river authority and not obtained from modeling data quality control was also performed on all available time series to remove the records considered not reliable according to the information provided by the authorities owning the data temporal changes in land use within the river basin were investigated using the corine dataset http www eea europa eu publications cor0 landcover which covers the years 1990 2000 2006 and 2012 2 2 interpolation of meteorological data the first step in performing the hydrological budget at the catchment scale is to obtain the spatial distribution of the climatic forcing i e precipitation and temperature from the point measurements available at the meteorological stations to this purpose daily precipitation as well as daily minimum maximum and mean temperatures were interpolated over a regular grid with size of 1 km preliminary evaluations showed that using a finer grid did not improve the accuracy of the estimates interpolation was performed by using both ordinary kriging ok and kriging with the external drift ked by using terrain elevation as secondary variable goovaerts 1997 details of the kriging algorithms are reported in the appendix a we preferred geostatistical interpolation to other interpolation schemes because it allows quantifying through the conditional mean and variance the probability distribution function pdf of the reference quantity at each estimation point see section 3 1 furthermore kriging is an exact interpolator in the sense that the estimated value is equal to the measured one at all the measurement points with the pdf reducing to a dirac delta function the estimation is obtained through a weighted linear combination of the measurements see appendix a weights assigned to the measurements reduce with the distance from the estimation point and may become negative when clustered measurements screen one to each other leading in some cases to non physical estimates such as negative precipitation to avoid such occurrence we reset negative and low weights to zero applying the correction method proposed by deutsch 1996 the remaining positive weights were rescaled such as to keep their sum to 1 as required to make the estimate unbiased notice that since our dataset was composed by a rather homogeneous distribution of meteorological stations see fig 2 only rarely the solution of the kriging system produced negative weights all these cases were recorded and carefully analyzed before accepting the interpolated values after weights correction interpolation was conducted by using measurements at the closest 8 16 and 32 meteorological stations assuming both exponential and spherical covariance functions thereby 12 independent estimates were obtained at each grid cell six with ok and six with ked in order to select the most suitable interpolation scheme and covariance model as well as the optimal number of neighboring stations a leave one out cross validation procedure was applied at daily time scale by comparing the average absolute errors of the independent estimates this procedure identified ked with 16 neighboring stations and exponential covariance model with nugget as the most suitable interpolation scheme for all the four variables precipitation mean maximum and minimum temperature the covariance function adopted in the ked was then 1 c r r σ n 2 δ r σ 2 exp 3 r a where r is the two point separation distance in eq 1 δ r epitomizes the nugget effect due to the lack of information at scales smaller than the shortest distance between pairs of measurement points and assumes the following expression δ r 1 if r 0 and δ r 0 otherwise notice that the nugget effect introduces a discontinuity in the covariance function at zero separation distance furthermore σ n 2 and σ 2 are the variances associated to scales smaller and larger than the minimum distance between measurements respectively finally the range a is the distance at which the covariance function is 5 of the value assumed at zero separation distance the values of the parameters of the optimal covariance function are reported in table 2 the mean of the absolute error provided by the cross validation resulted in 1 3 mm for daily precipitation and 0 02 c for mean as well as maximum and minimum daily temperature these values are in line with the findings of other studies in this region see e g laiti et al 2018 2 3 potential evapotranspiration model daily reference potential evapotranspiration et 0 was estimated cell by cell by using the hargreaves samani model see e g hargreaves and samani 1985 samani 2000 subedi and chávez 2015 eq 2 which we preferred to pennman montieth due to the very limited availability of meteorological data other than temperature and precipitation according to this model the daily potential evapotranspiration et 0 mm d 1 of a reference crop grass under standard conditions is given by 2 et 0 0 408 0 0023 ra td 0 50 t mean 17 8 where ra is the theoretical solar radiation mj m 2 d 1 which depends only on the location since the effect of topographic shadow and cloud cover is not considered td t max t min is the difference between the daily maximum and minimum temperature c and t mean is the daily mean temperature c potential evapotranspiration was then obtained by multiplying et 0 by the crop coefficient k c allen et al 1998 et p 0 7 k c et 0 with k c depending on the site specific vegetation and growth stage and hence varying in space and time following hargreaves 1994 allen et al 1998 and pat 2006 the 0 7 multiplication factor was applied in the expression of et p in order to counterbalance the tendency of eq 2 to overestimate et 0 under non standard conditions i e the standard conditions require well watered soils and disease free crops et p represents the upper limit of actual evapotranspiration since soil water content and atmospheric conditions e g wind cloudiness humidity may reduce the amount of water that crops and vegetation actually absorb mcmahon et al 2013 therefore climatic actual evapotranspiration aet clim was computed as follows aet clim α et p where α 1 is a stress factor reducing the potential evapotranspiration under these conditions the annual water budget assumes the following form 3 p q α et p w δ v 0 where p mm is the precipitation q mm is the streamflow volume α et p mm is the climatic actual evapotranspiration i e aet clim w mm is the volume of water uses not re entering the catchment after withdrawal and δ v mm is the change of water storage notice that all these variables were first aggregated spatially at the level of the sub basin and then temporally at the annual scale in this study we considered solar years for the annual aggregation of hydrological fluxes the water stress factor α was estimated by applying the water budget 3 in the period 1920 1950 when the effects of climate change were not evident and water consumption was negligible zolezzi et al 2009 notice that in this work we define the effects of climate change as the alterations of hydrological quantities that cannot be considered neither cyclic nor associated to water uses in particular we applied the water budget eq 3 in the time window 1920 1950 for the adige catchment closed at trento taking advantage of the long term historical streamflow data available at this gauging station therefore assuming the catchment in equilibrium δ v 0 and negligible water consumptions w 0 the long term average of eq 3 leads to the following expression for α 4 α p q et p where the bar over the symbols indicates the long term average in the period 1920 1950 storage in hydropower reservoirs is filtered out from the mean eq 4 because inter annual storage is very limited such as the amount of water withdrawn to feed hydropower plants in conterminous catchments zolezzi et al 2009 a similar approach was used by destouni et al 2013 and levi et al 2015 in swedish and balkan catchments other methods for estimating α are discussed by lyra et al 2016 the value of α obtained from eq 4 provides a reliable estimate of actual evapotranspiration in eq 3 also for the period successive to 1950 when water uses and climate change effects are not longer negligible and under the assumption that α does not change by assuming a constant α the time variability of water losses from evapotranspiration is assumed proportional to the climatic forcing in addition jarsjö et al 2008 have shown that a single multiplication factor captures accurately the aet variability around its overall average level temporally as well as spatially within a catchment in order to evaluate the uncertainty associated to the estimate of α we performed a sensitivity analysis by applying a non parametric bootstrap technique see e g efron and tibshirani 1994 based on random resampling with replacement of all the terms of eq 4 we used 10 000 random resamplings obtaining for α a mean value of 0 70 and a standard deviation of 0 045 the low value of the standard deviation confirms that α 0 70 is a reliable estimate disentangling w from δ v is more complicated and requires site specific analyses that will be detailed later 2 4 mann kendall trend analysis time series of the aforementioned hydrological variables p et p were calculated at each cell of the grid following the procedure described in sections 2 2 and 2 3 and then aggregated over the drainage area of the four selected sub catchments successively after deriving the stress factor α as shown in section 2 3 trends of p α et p and q were calculated by applying the mann kendall test see e g mann 1945 kendall 1975 hirsch et al 1982 with a significance level of 0 1 for both annual and seasonal aggregations and a moving time window of 30 years the width of the moving window was selected for mitigating the effects of short term fluctuations typical of natural cyclic fluctuations see e g zolezzi et al 2009 szolgayova et al 2014 this filtering effect should not conceal the anthropogenic impact which is typically non cyclic and the long term fluctuations i e more than 30 years which we assumed are chiefly due to climate change see e g houghton et al 2001 the choice of 30 years as the width of the time windows for the computation of trends is based on the sensitivity analysis reported in the appendix b kendall s rank correlations were performed through the r statistical software package kendall by kendall 2011 2 5 auxiliary statistical methods the spearman s rank correlation spearman 1904 was calculated separately for each selected driver to estimate the level of correlation between tho observed hydrological alterations and the possible drivers as a quantitative measure of the influence and relative importance of the processes controlling the hydrological alterations we employed the one way analysis of variance anova with a linear model see e g chambers and hastie 1992 this technique allows to assess the relative weights of concurrent drivers by estimating the share of variance of a selected hydrological alteration that can be attributed to each of these factors these analyses were performed by using the r statistical software package stats and anova was applied with a significance level of p 0 05 3 trend detection 3 1 uncertainty of precipitation estimation in alpine regions a major source of uncertainty in the water budget is the smoothing and in some cases the bias introduced by interpolating precipitations measured at the meteorological stations weingartner et al 2007 laiti et al 2018 preliminary data analysis showed that the average distance among temperature stations is much smaller than the integral scale i e 4 3 km against 18 km as shown in previous studies see e g bellin et al 1992 four points per integral scale suffice to obtain a good reproduction of a random function in addition the average of the absolute error obtained by applying the leave one out cross validation method goovaerts 1997 section 4 2 4 was 0 02 c a small value not affecting the evapotranspiration estimates following these considerations and according to a number of studies in different climatic areas see e g hofstra et al 2009 laiti et al 2018 we decided to neglect temperature uncertainty since it is typically small compared to that of precipitation at the catchment scale such as its effect on streamflow in the present work we evaluated the uncertainty introduced by the spatialization of point measurements of precipitation assumed as free of errors because of the high reliability of available data and the lack of information on the errors in the precipitation measurements phillips and marks 1996 conditional mean and variance the former representing the optimal estimation in the mean square sense were obtained by using ked with the n 16 meteorological stations closest to the estimation point see section 2 2 in doing that the searching neighborhood changes according to the local density of the gauging stations and may include stations outside the catchment of interest under the assumption that the quantity of interest is distributed according to a parametric probability distribution fully characterized by the first two moments estimation uncertainty at a given point is obtained by simply replacing the first two conditional moments i e the conditional mean and the conditional variance into the expression of the pdf in line with previous studies see e g coe and stern 1982 wilks 1989 wilks 1990 hofstra et al 2009 we adopted the gamma distribution for the days with more than 1 mm of precipitation wet days which density function is the following 5 f z 1 γ k θ k z k 1 exp z θ z k θ 0 where z is a realization of the random variable z i e daily precipitation k is the shape parameter and θ is the scale parameter the parameters k and θ are related to the first two moments μ z and σ z 2 as follows 6 k μ z 2 σ z 2 θ σ z 2 μ z therefore at each point x 0 of the interpolation grid the pdf of the variable z eq 5 is obtained by replacing into eq 6 μ z and σ z 2 with the conditional mean z x 0 and the conditional variance σ z c 2 x 0 respectively both provided by ked see eqs a 2 and a 4 in the appendix a the choice of the gamma distribution was supported by the pearson s chi squared test applied to the precipitation time series available at each station all the stations passed the statistical test with an average p value of 0 003 the selection of ked as geostatistical interpolator and its parameters was already discussed in section 2 2 we quantified the uncertainty affecting the estimates of the spatial mean precipitation at a given sub catchment by performing 5 000 monte carlo simulations of the precipitation time series at each grid cell of the study domain which were proven to be enough to obtain convergence of the first two statistical moments at each monte carlo realization the conditional pdfs of the variable of interest were sampled to extract at each node of the grid a random value conditional through ked to the measurements then we aggregated the estimates over the four selected sub catchments in order to derive the average annual precipitation time series and the associated statistics of error we also verified that the standard deviation of the estimate averaged over the entire domain of interest did not change significantly in time e g it slightly reduced from 4 8 mm in the former decade 1956 1965 to 4 3 mm in the intermediate decade 1980 1989 and to 4 1 mm in the last decade 2004 2013 thereby highlighting a small to negligible effect of the variation over time in the number of stations with available data the analysis also revealed that the uncertainty bounds in the annual estimates of precipitation here defined as the average distances between the upper and lower limits of the 90 confidence interval of the annual estimates were narrow for all the investigated sub catchments and equal to 2 2 mm at trento 2 7 mm at bronzolo 11 7 mm at mantana and 15 4 mm at soraga against mean annual values of 911 8 mm 883 5 mm 921 7 mm and 1 034 9 mm for the same catchments headwaters i e gadera at mantana and avisio at soraga show higher uncertainty than the larger catchments at bronzolo and trento because of the lack of meteorological stations at high elevation however in all cases the amplitude of the 90 confidence interval was lower than 1 5 of the average annual precipitation therefore demonstrating that uncertainty introduced by the spatialization of precipitation has no appreciable effects on the annual water budget 3 2 analysis of spatial distribution of hydro meteorological data the long term averages 1956 2013 of annual precipitation annual mean temperature and climatic actual evapotranspiration were evaluated at the center of the cells obtained by dividing the adige river basin into a regular grid with spacing of 1 km the resulting fields are shown in fig 3 the annual average precipitation panel a ranges from 500 mm in the north west i e val venosta to 1 600 mm in the south east of the basin typical climatic characteristics of the region as well as the orographic effect in the north east were clearly captured as expected the orographic effect is much more pronounced for the temperature panel b with the long term annual mean that reduces from about 15 c in the deep valleys to 0 c along the mountain crests the climatic actual evapotranspiration aet clim panel c was gridded by aggregating at the annual scale the daily values of the et p multiplied by α see section 2 3 as expected a strong orographic effect is observed for this variable with an evident clear reduction from south to north finally the water yield p α et p which represents the potential streamflow generation is shown in panel d notice that water yield does not account for snow accumulation and melting across different years as expected the water yield is higher in the headwaters whereas in the valley bottoms much of the precipitation is needed to satisfy evapotranspiration demand the time series of streamflow volume q precipitation p climatic actual evapotranspiration aet clim and water yield p aet clim at the annual time scale are shown in fig 4 all quantities are aggregated at the four gauging stations of trento bronzolo mantana and soraga panels a b c and d respectively as customary the volume is normalized with respect to the catchment area hence it is expressed in mm the precipitation behaves similarly in all catchments varying between 600 mm and 1 400 mm except in the upper avisio where it is consistently higher than in the other sub catchments the annual climatic actual evapotranspiration is relatively small and varies between 200 and 300 mm without appreciable trends despite the large difference in the drainage areas and in their mean elevation see table 1 the time series of annual streamflow volume are similar at all the gauging stations and show large temporal variations between a minimum of 400 mm to a maximum of 1 200 mm the water yield mimics streamflow but showing relevant differences which investigation is indeed the main objective of the present study from the year 2000 onward at the gauging station of trento fig 4a the water yield is always larger than streamflow a similar behavior is observed at bronzolo fig 4b though with less pronounced differences similarly but from 2007 onward water yields exceeds streamflow at both gauging stations of mantana and soraga 3 3 trend analysis trend analysis was conducted at seasonal and annual time scales by using the mann kendall test see section 2 4 with the significance level set to 0 1 since trends change with time overlapping moving time windows of 30 years with origins from 1956 to 1984 were used and the trends were computed sliding the window of one year at a time the resulting trends are shown in fig 5 a d the summer season is between june and august in order to include most of the snow and glacier melting period for the purpose of the manuscript this is equivalent to assume the hydrological year as reference at annual scale relatively large trends though not always statistically significant are observed for precipitation p and streamflow volume q while climatic actual evapotranspiration aet clim shows a small positive trend at most 2 mm year 1 with statistical significance extending over longer periods precipitation trends are similar in all the sub catchments except for the upper avisio soraga see fig 5 panel d where large positive trends of about 7 mm year 1 are observed in the period 1967 2003 statistically not significant trends either positive or negative are detected in all the other sub catchments with significant positive trends localized in time occurring locally as for example between 1971 and 2001 in the northern portion of the river basin closed at the gauging station of bronzolo a slight general upward trend in precipitation for the whole adige river basin was detected by lutz et al 2016 during the period 1971 2010 and also by beniston et al 1994 and scherrer et al 2015 with reference to a number of swiss alpine catchments during the past century streamflow volumes q follow only partially the observed trends in precipitation the adige experiences a significant reduction of the streamflow at trento in the period 1975 2009 with a trend of about 9 mm year 1 whereas at bronzolo streamflow does not show any particular trend however in the small nested sub catchments of gadera at mantana and avisio at soraga streamflows show positive trends in the range 4 6 mm year 1 from 1971 onwards in the former and up to 10 mm year 1 from 1970 to 2005 in the latter different behaviors are observed for the terms of the water budget aggregated at the seasonal scale as illustrated in fig 6 climatic actual evapotranspiration shows negligible trends in all seasons except in summer when they are slightly positive trends in precipitation vary across the seasons though with patterns similar in all the nested sub catchments in fact significant negative trends are observed in winter during the period 1970 2010 with maximum reduction of about 4 mm year 1 in spring trends are positive and statistically significant in the first part of the study period whereas from the 70s negative trends prevail summer precipitations are nearly constant no significant trends in the whole study period at all locations autumn precipitation trends are first negative and become positive in the period 1970 2000 this is more evident in the upper avisio catchment closed at soraga where positive trends of about 7 mm year 1 can be observed similarly to what is observed at the annual scale seasonal streamflow volumes vary in space in the last 30 years winter trends were nearly absent at trento gauging station and slightly positive at bronzolo conversely significant positive trends characterize winter streamflow in the other two nested sub catchments since the 70s notice that winter streamflow trends are often opposite to the trends of precipitation in the same season indicating a complex response of the river basin to changes of the climatic forcing see section 4 in spring trends in precipitation and streamflow are more consistent significant negative trends are observed for summer streamflow starting from the 70s especially at trento gauging station where negative trends of about 6 mm year 1 are detected in the period 1977 2007 as in winter these patterns do not reflect changes in precipitation finally autumn trends in streamflow are higher in the small nested sub catchments of gadera at mantana and avisio at soraga than in the adige at trento and bronzolo located along the main stem of the adige river and with a much larger contributing area in this season increasing trends in the avisio at soraga amount to a maximum of 5mm year 1 patterns of autumn streamflow at all the investigated locations are similar to that of precipitation in the same season the complex interplay between drivers of change and observed trends will be analyzed in the ensuing section 4 trend attribution in this section the statistically significant changes in streamflow detected in section 3 3 are attributed to selected drivers by means of a multi method framework seeking for evidence of consistency or evidence of inconsistency see e g merz et al 2012 in particular mann kendall trend test spearman s rank correlation and analysis of variance were used to investigate the following detected changes i the reduction of summer streamflow of the adige at trento and bronzolo and ii the increase of winter streamflow in the gadera and upper avisio catchments although previous studies identified similar changes in other alpine regions see e g birsan et al 2005 kormann et al 2015 they did not explore the combined effect of climate change and water uses here we analyze such interplay with reference to the adige river which is large enough to be considered representative of the southern part of the european alps a summary of the drivers evaluated in the attribution exercise is shown in table 3 4 1 attribution of decreasing summer streamflow at large scale since the 2000s the annual streamflow volume experienced a reduction at the gauging station of trento chiefly due to a large reduction of summer streamflows a similar reduction was observed also at the upstream section of bronzolo see fig 4 though much weaker and insufficient to induce a significant negative trend as can be seen in fig 5b here we consider five possible drivers of the observed change at trento a1 reduction of summer precipitation a2 higher summer evapotranspiration as a consequence of air temperature warming a3 shrinkage of the glaciers providing less water during summer melting a4 increase of water uses other than hydropower a5 reduction of winter snow the drivers a1 a2 a3 and a5 are consequences of climate change whereas the driver a4 is the result of the anthropogenic impact unfortunately the lack of reliable data on changes of water uses hinders a direct attribution and therefore we proceeded by elimination of causes that are inconsistent with the observed changes see e g merz et al 2012 we decided to exclude hydropower use from the list of the possible drivers since operational rules are such as to limit seasonal accumulation autorità di bacino del fiume adige 2008 which in addition shows a small to negligible inter annual variability pat 2007 thereby suggesting a negligible influence on the observed trends attribution was performed by considering for both drivers and streamflow time series the evolution in time of the trends over moving windows of 30 years calculated following the procedure presented in section 3 3 in particular we did not employ the daily time series of the drivers in order to avoid the effect that gaps in the data presence of outliers and measurement error may have on the evaluation of the possible correlations between streamflow and drivers themselves this is in line with the findings of goodwin and leech 2006 which suggest the use of transformed variables to reduce the emergence of mistaken correlation fig 7 shows the trends of the summer hydrological fluxes of the catchment contributing to the gauging station of trento left panel starting from 1974 streamflow trends are negative and statistically significant filled blue bullets and this occurs despite the trends of precipitation are positive and increasing though statistically not significant therefore the option a1 should be discarded because the changes of summer precipitation are opposite to the changes in streamflow moreover also the hypothesis a2 cannot be invoked as possible cause of summer streamflow reduction given that the magnitude of trends in aet clim green bullets is much smaller than that of streamflow the following evidences suggest to exclude also glacier melting hypothesis a3 from the possible drivers as melting proceeds the runoff generated by the glaciers in the adige catchment is determined by two contrasting effects the increase of the melting rate in terms of water equivalent lost each year by the glaciers and the contemporaneous reduction of the surface see e g knoll and kerschner 2009 there are evidences that in the period considered in the present study these two contrasting effects were almost in equilibrium in particular haeberli et al 2007 reported the melting rate of 9 alpine glaciers which intensified significantly from the 80s reaching 0 7 m year 1 in the decade 1985 1994 and 0 8 m year 1 in the following decade 1995 2004 the total glaciers area in these two decades can be estimated as that registered in the middle years of the time windows which is 151 km2 in the year 1990 and 129 km2 in the year 2000 these estimates were obtained from the inventory by knoll and kerschner 2009 for the bolzano province and by using the corine land cover information for the trentino province http www eea europa eu publications cor0 landcover hence the average annual runoff generated by the glaciers at trento occurring mostly in summer results in 10 7 mm in the decade 1985 1994 and to 10 5 mm in the following period 1995 2004 both are less than 5 of the summer runoff at the trento gauging station 240 mm considering that the middle of the two considered time windows is 10 years apart the trend can be estimated to be 0 02 mm year 1 which is within the margin of error of the estimate of 2 mm year 1 obtained by trend analysis of summer runoff at trento see fig 7 left panel these calculations are based on published data see haeberli et al 2007 knoll and kerschner 2009 and show that an increased rate of melting offsets the reduction in runoff caused by the glaciers shrinkage leading to a negligible contribution to the overall trend data scarcity impedes to include glaciers melting as a driver in a formal analysis however given the above evidences of its marginal influence on the observed reduction of summer streamflow at trento we excluded it from the possible drivers the effect of snowmelting i e the runoff produced by the snow accumulated in the previous winter will be considered explicitly as a driver in the following hypothesis a5 conversely the hypothesis a4 is coherent with the data of apple production in the middle and lower noce valley in fact despite analysis of land cover changes as retrieved by corine maps showed little variations in the agricultural land use of the adige river basin the maps show a reduction of about 0 2 in the period 1990 2006 starting from the 70s apple production almost doubled from 69 to about 130 tons in about 10 years zanon 1978 in italian unfortunately a direct attribution exercise was impossible due to the absence of information on water uses by the agricultural sector however the limit of 0 05 m3 s 1 km 2 to water use enforced since 2006 in the agricultural sector together with financial incentives to change the irrigation system from sprinkler to drip irrigation pat 2006 parte viii may have contributed to the attenuation of the negative trend observed from 1977 onward since streamflow changes in the years after 2006 influences the trends successive to 1976 years after 2006 enters in the time windows with origin successive to 1977 in addition the trend analysis of standard deviation of summer streamflow mcmahon et al 2007 suggests that observed changes in this period can be attributed to a component that varies slowly in time since from the 70s negative trends of streamflow standard deviation are less pronounced than those of streamflow itself result shown in fig 6 a similar behavior though much weaker was observed at the upstream section of bronzolo fig 7 right panel this behavior is consistent with the intensification of apple production in the noce catchment contributing to the adige river downstream of bronzolo which was accompanied by an increased water use in late spring and summer during the apple growing season nevertheless according to the available data on water concessions pat 2006 parte iii water uses in the noce catchment are less than 9m3 s 1 which is minor than the maximum observed reduction of summer streamflow at trento compared to bronzolo i e about 20m3 s 1 between 1980 and 2010 hence despite an influence of the hypothesis a4 on the summer streamflow alterations cannot be excluded at large scale we argue that other drivers of change should act concurrently the remaining hypothesized driver a5 is the reduction in winter snow accumulation which entails diminished streamflow contribution from snow melting in the following warm season the time series of accumulated snow water equivalent was estimated by subtracting at each estimation point the precipitation of rainy days from the total precipitation a day is classified as rainy when with a precipitation larger than 0 1 mm and with a mean temperature higher than 0 c in particular we observed that the trends in winter snow black squares in fig 7 are coherent with those of streamflow especially at bronzolo right panel for which the magnitudes of significant trends are very similar hence besides the water uses for irrigation in summer a4 also the reduction of winter snow a5 exerts a strong control on streamflow reduction in the following summer season in order to quantify the relative influence of the analyzed drivers the spearman s rank correlation and the one way analysis of variance anova were applied to the time series of the trends see section 2 5 computed as described in section 3 3 spearman s rank correlation analysis confirmed that summer streamflow trends in the adige at trento and bronzolo were not significantly correlated with a significance level of 0 05 neither with the trends in summer precipitation a1 r 4 5 10 1 and r 6 6 10 2 for trento and bronzolo respectively nor with the trends in summer evapotranspiration a2 r 1 6 10 1 and r 4 5 10 1 for trento and bronzolo respectively conversely strong significant correlation was found with the trends in winter snow a5 r 8 5 10 1 and r 7 5 10 1 for trento and bronzolo respectively anova was applied considering the trends in summer streamflow as dependent variable and the available time series of the trends in the drivers as independent variables a1 a2 and a5 after verifying that the errors are independent and normally distributed we were able to estimate the share of variance of the trends in summer streamflow attributable to each one of these factors in both large scale catchments the most important factor was the reduction of winter snow with a share of variance of 77 and 56 for trento and bronzolo respectively significance probability p 0 05 the residual variance not explained by the selected drivers was of 9 and 29 at trento and bronzolo respectively this leaves room for considering agricultural water uses to contribute though to a much lesser extent than winter precipitation to the reduction of streamflow observed in the last two decades 4 2 attribution of increasing winter streamflow at the headwaters trend analysis of observed time series detected a significant change of winter streamflow at the headwaters of gadera at mantana and avisio at soraga fig 8a and b respectively here land and water uses differ with respect to the adige river basin at bronzolo and trento for instance the gadera catchment mantana is free of reservoirs and the upper avisio soraga includes only the fedaia reservoir in the upper part of the catchment which receives water from the marmolada glacier in addition the agricultural land in the latter catchment is very limited table 1 evapotranspiration here is lower than the average of the adige catchment because of the lower temperatures and the absence of crops see the western part of the basin in fig 3c fig 8 also shows that while winter streamflow increased winter precipitation showed the opposite trend in addition evapotranspiration did not change during the observation period to attribute the detected changes in winter streamflow at the headwaters we considered here three hypotheses b1 increased snow and glacier melting as a consequence of air temperature warming b2 increasing winter liquid precipitation rainfall induced by warmer temperatures b3 change in groundwater dynamics reflecting shifts in the seasonal distribution of precipitation as in section 4 1 all the time series are considered in terms of trends over moving time windows of 30 years glacier melting b1 is not likely to provide the excess of water in the global budget in fact although the marmolada glacier shrank in the last century crepaz et al 2009 in italian streamflow produced by the glacier which has an area of about 3 3 km2 is first stored in the fedaia reservoir and then diverted to the cordevole river a tributary of the piave river east of the adige catchment for hydropower production enel 1974 del fiume adige 2008 pat 2012 a partial shift of winter precipitation from solid to liquid b2 is the hypothesis suggested by birsan et al 2005 and bocchiola 2014 in studies on swiss and italian alpine catchments respectively projected increases in winter streamflow for high altitude first order streams in switzerland with glaciers in their catchment are discussed also by bavay et al 2013 and explained by an increasing number of snow melting events in winter and by precipitation falling as rain instead of snow due to the higher air temperature scenarios provided in the time frames 2021 2050 and 2070 2095 similar results are reported in majone et al 2016 for the noce catchment with reference to the time frame 2040 2070 nevertheless this is hardly the cause of the observed increase of winter streamflow in the past decades in the upper avisio because winter temperature was rather slightly decreasing i e 0 02 c year 1 in this catchment given that data about variations in time of the snow cover was not available over the whole study period we analyzed the changes in the surface area above the freezing level i e altitude at which average daily temperature is equal to 0 c assuming that it represents an approximation of the land surface potentially covered by snow the rationale behind this is the hypothesis that an increase in temperature would reduce the freezing days while enlarging the area of the catchment in which winter precipitation falls as rainfall thereby increasing streamflow in particular we analyzed the behavior of the number of days with mean temperature below 0 c as a function of the area expressed as percentage of the total catchment area for a few decades from 1960 to 2010 see fig 9 a starting from the 90s the curves show an increase in the number of freezing days at high elevations i e for small areas which contrasts the reduction of the number of freezing days at low elevations a similar result was found by stewart 2009 at global scale fig 9a also suggests that the number of freezing days reduced at elevations below 1 500 m a s l corresponding to about 40 of the river basin the reduction of freezing days at relatively low elevations was confirmed by several large scale studies chiefly based on the analysis of time series at middle low elevation stations see e g brunetti et al 2006 in addition marcolini et al 2017 identified a larger reduction of average snow depth and snow cover duration for the stations in the adige catchment located below 1 650 m a s l than for those located at higher elevation in the last decades consequently the rise in winter streamflow volume cannot be attributed to a shift of winter precipitation from solid to liquid given that the number of days mainly in the winter season with temperature below freezing increased in about 60 of the catchment area which includes the typical elevations of both gadera and upper avisio catchments see table 1 analysis of freezing days of the avisio catchment upstream soraga see fig 9b confirmed the previous result showing that a large part of the mountainous areas and the valleys located at high elevations experienced a reduction of air temperature i e increasing number of freezing days in the past decades conversely in swiss watersheds where more than half of the land surface is above 1 000 m a s l birsan et al 2005 observed in the period 1961 2000 a substantial reduction of the number of days with minimum daily air temperature below 0 c attribution was performed by means of correlation analysis between the trends of observed winter streamflows at mantana and soraga and the time series of the hypothesized drivers i intensification of snow and glacier melting contribution b1 ii shift from solid to liquid precipitation in winter b2 and iii increase of autumn aquifer recharge b3 as a proxy for snow and glacier melting contribution b1 we considered the time evolution of the number of winter days with the mean air temperature above a threshold temperature for which snowpack melts this threshold is typically adopted in simplified degree day snow models which require air temperature as the only parameter rango and martinec 1995 hock 2003 majone et al 2010 we fixed the threshold at 3 c which is the value inferred by laiti et al 2018 through hydrological modeling conducted in the adige river basin similarly winter liquid precipitation b2 was obtained from the winter precipitation data by subtracting for each estimation point the volumes recorded during the freezing days i e with mean daily temperature below 0 c when precipitation is supposed to fall as snow finally hypothesis b3 was verified by assuming that the time series of the changes in autumn aquifer recharge can be approximated with the time series of the residuals δ v as retrieved from water budget eq 3 in doing this we have also implicitly assumed that for these sub catchments water uses w are marginal spearman s rank correlation analysis highlighted that winter streamflow trends in the gadera at mantana and avisio at soraga were not significantly correlated with a significance level of 0 05 neither with the change in snow and glacier melting b1 r 4 9 10 2 and r 8 4 10 3 for mantana and soraga respectively nor with the dynamics of changing phase of precipitation b2 r 2 4 10 1 and r 4 4 10 1 for mantana and soraga respectively these considerations led to the conclusion that the rise of winter streamflow in these two headwater catchments was caused by other factors than the changes in the winter precipitation characteristics and the direct consequences of changing temperature in a recent study zampieri et al 2015 observed that changes of seasonality in precipitation play a major role in streamflows alterations particularly for the earlier spring streamflow over most of the alps in our case we made the hypothesis that the surplus of precipitation in autumn enters groundwater where it resides longer than in the other hydrological compartments i e surficial waters to finally contribute to winter streamflow this hypothesis is confirmed by the analysis of the standard deviation of winter streamflow see fig 6 in fact if the increase of winter streamflow was due to the increase of winter rainfall the standard deviation of streamflow would rise in proportion mcmahon et al 2007 however this was not the case since the standard deviation did not change remaining smaller than in all the other seasons thereby corroborating the hypothesis of increasing baseflow as the main cause of raising streamflow furthermore spearman s rank correlation revealed significant positive correlation between the trends in autumn aquifer recharge and the increase of winter streamflow r 0 86 for the gadera at mantana and r 0 64 for the avisio at soraga to provide a quantitative measure of the influence and relative importance of the possible controlling factors we applied a one way analysis of variance anova see section 2 5 with the trends in winter streamflow as dependent variable and the trends in the three possible drivers as independent variables after verifying that the errors are independent and normally distributed we were able to estimate the share of variance of the trends in winter streamflow attributable to each one of these factors in both headwater catchments the significance probability p is lower than 0 05 only for the variable assumed as proxy for autumn aquifer recharge i e p 10 8 on the contrary the shift from solid to liquid precipitation in winter and the intensification of snow and glacier melting play a negligible role being characterized by p 0 05 hence the only plausible reason of the increasing winter streamflow in the two investigated sub catchments is the increased autumn contribution in aquifer recharge 5 discussion and conclusions attribution of hydrological changes to multiple drivers is in general a complex procedure requiring much more effort than the case in which a single driver is considered data availability constitutes a main limitation since it is often scarce in time and space and affected by multiple sources of uncertainty nonetheless this additional effort is necessary to understand the non linear interactions and feedbacks between hydrological alterations and the forces driving them see e g kormann et al 2015 modeling could be used in theory to simulate hydrological and anthropogenic quantities like e g land use change over time not available in the region of investigation and thus to quantify the relative importance of the different drivers provided that suitable models can be reliably set up however this advantage is counterbalanced by the additional source of uncertainty that is involved in the parameterizations of such models and in the simplifications adopted to conceptualize the system dynamics on the contrary the data driven approach proposed in this work does not suffer from this limitation focusing the analyses on observed time series of detected changes and possible drivers we acknowledge that this approach is advisable for trend detection and attribution analyses to be performed in regions presenting sufficient data availability measured data could be eventually supplemented by appropriate proxies see e g kundzewicz and robson 2004 which however could introduce in the attribution exercise additional uncertainty if any modeling is needed in the proxies evaluation in the present work we analyzed long term time series of daily climatic and hydrological variables in the adige river basin an important alpine river basin in the north east of italy trends of climatic forcing variables hydrological fluxes and storage term in the water budget were computed and compared in four nested sub catchments of the river basin thereafter we employed a multi method approach in which inferential statistics techniques were used to test concurrent hypotheses for a rigorous identification of the drivers of hydrological change in particular the attribution of the observed alterations to their main causes was performed by providing evidences of consistency or inconsistency of different plausible hypotheses following the approach proposed by merz et al 2012 the analyses evidenced temporal patterns differentiated within the river basin depending on the reciprocal strength of water uses and their changes in time and climate change in particular two main changes were detected in the streamflow time series i a reduction of summer streamflow of the adige at trento and ii an increase of winter streamflow in the gadera and upper avisio catchments a summary of the attribution exercise is shown in table 3 in the two headwaters positive trends in winter streamflow are detected at the gauging stations of gadera at mantana and avisio at soraga which are observed also at the annual scale despite an evident reduction of winter precipitation accurate trend analysis spearman s rank correlation and multivariate analysis of variance revealed that this change cannot be attributed neither to an increased winter snow and glacier melting nor to a shift of winter precipitation from solid to liquid but rather to a larger groundwater contribution triggered by a proportional increase of groundwater recharge in autumn due to larger precipitation this is the stigma of climate change given that headwaters are only marginally impacted by agricultural activities and seasonal storage for hydropower is very limited this effect vanishes as the drainage area increases moving downstream with only a marginal increase of winter streamflow observed at the bronzolo and trento gauging stations on the contrary in the southern part of the river basin decreasing winter snow is the main driver of streamflow reduction possibly supplemented by increasing water uses in agriculture the latter are mainly caused by an intense development of irrigated agriculture since the 70s in the drainage area of the noce river a tributary of the adige the former although it is present in the whole adige river basin affects only the summer streamflows at large scale to summarize besides a possible partial contribution of agricultural water uses at large scale climate change is the main driver of recent changes and it manifests itself in different ways according to the scale of study in particular in headwater basins the larger autumn precipitation entails increasing winter streamflow whereas the reduction of winter snow implies decreasing summer streamflow but only at the large scale we remark that the attribution of hydrological trends to their causes should be made with caution and need to be supported by compelling evidences despite several attempts have been made with different methodologies for separating the anthropogenic and climatic components of hydrological alterations a standard procedure is not available and a multi method approach as the one presented in this work represents in our view a comprehensive and rigorous methodology that can be relevant to attribution studies conducted in areas experiencing comparable changes of the hydrological cycle acknowledgments this research received financial support by the

measurements z x i located at x i i 1 n x 0 a 1 z x 0 m x 0 i 1 n x 0 λ i x 0 z x i m x i where λ i x 0 is the weight assigned to the measurement z x i and m is the local mean m x 0 at the estimation location x 0 and m x i at position x i several forms of geostatistical interpolation are available depending on the model of spatial variability for the mean in the simple kriging sk the mean is constant and known m x m constant x in the ordinary kriging ok the mean is constant but unknown m x constant for x x 0 x x i for i 1 n x 0 in the kriging with a trend model kt the unknown mean m x smoothly varies within each local neighborhood as a linear combination of functions f k x of the coordinates such that m x a 0 x k 1 k a k x f k x where the coefficients a 0 x are constant and unknown the kriging with external drift ked is a variant of kt since the trend m x is modeled as a linear function of a smoothly varying second variable y x m x a 0 x a 1 x y x in this case the estimate shown in eq a 1 can be written as follows a 2 z x 0 i 1 n x 0 λ i x 0 z x i and the system of n x 0 2 linear equations providing the n x 0 weights λ i x 0 i 1 n x 0 to be used into eq a 2 assumes the

goovaerts 1997 for additional information of these and other types of geostatistical interpolation we refer to the book by goovaerts 1997 appendix b selection of the time window width for the computation of trends the rationale for the selection of 30 years moving time window was in the attempt to mitigate the effects of short term fluctuations typical of natural cyclic fluctuations however some authors e g kundzewicz and robson 2004 spence and brown 2016 warn that apparent trends may result in case of short record lengths suggesting the use of time windows longer than 50 years in order to discuss the possible effects on trends detection embedded in the selection of a different moving time window we decided to perform a sensitivity analysis by changing progressively the width of the time window itself in particular we computed the trends of streamflow q actual climatic evapotranspiration aet clim and precipitation p for the adige at trento gauging station by considering moving time windows ranging from 3 years to the whole record length i e 58 years the results of such analysis are reported in fig b 10 where each pixel of the matrices represents the value of trend computed on a time window whose starting and finish years are indicated in the horizontal and vertical axes respectively we notice how the trends computed over short time windows pixel close to the diagonals are of higher magnitude brighter colors and change sign quickly on the contrary trends computed over longer time windows far from the diagonal near to the top left corners are more attenuated and stable in time we also notice that trends associated to all three variables for time windows larger than 30 years i e our selection see also the dashed gray lines indicated by the black arrows in fig b 10 do not present any scattering in the sign of the trend though as expected the magnitude slightly decrease as a consequence of the smoothing effect induced by a larger time window from our point view these results indicate that the selection of 30 years as time window is optimal in the sense that it is short enough to appreciate the changes of trends over time and at the same time it is long enough to filter out cyclic fluctuations associated to shorter periods appendix c supplementary data supplementary data associated with this article can be found in the online version

6409,the alpine region is a particularly sensitive environment rich in water resources nurturing delicate freshwater ecosystems which are however threatened by intensive exploitation for hydropower production and irrigated agriculture the impact of water uses on the hydrological cycle is intimately intertwined with changes of the climatic forcing which operate over a wide range of temporal and spatial scales in the present study historical time series of streamflow precipitation and temperature recorded in the adige river basin a large alpine watershed in northeastern italy are analyzed in order to quantify alterations of the main hydrological fluxes due to changes in climate and water uses spatial and temporal patterns of change are detected by comparing annual and seasonal components of the water budget performed in four representative sub catchments with size ranging from 207 to 9 852 km2 characterized by different climatic and water use conditions afterwards a multi method approach is applied for attributing the observed changes to their main drivers summer streamflow depletion affects the adige lowlands since the 70s which is attributed to both the reduction of winter precipitation and the development of irrigated agriculture conversely winter streamflow increased in headwater catchments due to the increase of aquifers recharge in autumn which is consistent with the increase of precipitation in the same period these results reveal that the impact of climate change on the adige basin is multifaceted scale dependent and intertwined with the effects of changes in water resources exploitation keywords trend detection trend attribution climate change anthropogenic impact water budget hydrological alterations 1 introduction the relevant role of climate change on the observed alterations of the water cycle in snow dominated regions is widely recognized particularly in the european alps see e g beniston 2003 barnett et al 2005 coppola and giorgi 2010 finger et al 2012 gobiet et al 2014 gampe et al 2016 majone et al 2016 pagán et al 2016 a number of contributions suggest that recent changes in precipitation patterns and the contemporaneous rise of temperature have led to rapid glaciers melting and intensification of evaporation with a consequent alteration of the typical alpine hydrological regime see e g birsan et al 2005 kormann et al 2015 this notwithstanding the impact of climate change on water resources and freshwater ecosystem functioning has been observed to be much weaker than in other mediterranean river basins see e g lutz et al 2016 diamantini et al 2018 in addition anthropogenic pressure factors such as land use changes hydropower and agricultural developments and increasing population have been shown to drive important streamflow alterations in alpine catchments see e g long 1987 zolezzi et al 2009 zolezzi et al 2011 chiogna et al 2016 and their influence should be carefully quantified and separated from the climatic one disentangling climatic and anthropogenic impacts on hydrological fluxes is however a challenging task since they combine in a complex nonlinear manner recent studies attempted to use satellite products to perform such partitioning e g douglas et al 2006 loarie et al 2011 though these analyses are limited by the relatively short time span in which such products are available other studies addressed this issue through water balance often coupled with modeling whose accuracy depends on the availability and quality of hydro climatic and land use data see e g zhang et al 2008 tomer and schilling 2009 destouni et al 2013 jaramillo et al 2013 renner et al 2014 levi et al 2015 abera et al 2017 currently most of the available studies focus on the attribution of flood changes see e g merz et al 2012 hall et al 2014 viglione et al 2016 whereas hydrological alterations are less studied see e g long 1987 harrigan et al 2014 duethmann et al 2015 despite a systematic spatially distributed hydrological monitoring is active since the beginning of the past century in the alpine region several studies analyzed trends in streamflow see e g chiew and mcmahon 1996 burn and elnur 2002 birsan et al 2005 bard et al 2015 precipitation see e g brunetti et al 2006 and temperature see e g weber et al 1997 separately without assessing their interplay and the consequences on water budget dynamics the compelling need of assessing the multiple and concurring causes of streamflow alterations observed in the alpine region especially in the recent decades when these changes became more evident was highlighted by birsan et al 2005 a similar conclusion was drawn by kormann et al 2015 who specified that an integrated approach is desirable since available studies in alpine catchments focus on the trends of single drivers of change furthermore bocchiola 2014 highlighted the importance of improving our understanding of the hydrological budget in alpine catchments to unravel the processes controlling the observed patterns of variation moving from the identification of changes in flood magnitude and frequency see e g hodgkins et al 2017 to a deep understanding and quantification of the processes driving the observed alterations of the hydrological cycle is a thorny problem because large uncertainties plague hydrological modeling while observational data are often incomplete and affected by measurement errors serinaldi et al 2018 recently merz et al 2012 proposed a rigorous framework for trend attribution on floods which is based on three main steps 1 evidence of consistency 2 evidence of inconsistency and 3 provision of a confidence level steps 1 and 2 can be performed with inferential statistics techniques such as optimal fingerprinting see e g hasselmann 1997 allen and stott 2003 for example this technique has been widely used in the context of climate change detection and attribution and is based on a multivariate regression approach in which the analyzed time series are represented as a linear combination of signal patterns i e fingerprints when applied to hydrological fluxes this approach requires a comprehensive monitoring of hydrological variables well beyond what is commonly available from standard environmental monitoring by river authorities harrigan et al 2014 when necessary kundzewicz and robson 2004 suggest to consider also related variables i e proxies to increase the amount of information used in the analysis for instance a proxy of glacier melting could be the period with air temperature higher than zero above a certain elevation focusing on the alpine region most of the studies indicated the rising temperature as the principal cause of the observed increase of winter and contemporaneous reduction of summer streamflows the former caused by a shift of winter precipitation from snow to rain and the latter by an increased summer evapotranspiration see e g scherrer and appenzeller 2004 barnett et al 2005 birsan et al 2005 bocchiola 2014 here we explored alternative hypotheses by employing a multi method approach in which inferential statistics techniques were used for a rigorous identification of the drivers of hydrological changes in the adige river basin a large alpine catchment in northeastern italy this objective was pursued by analyzing changes of hydrological variables in nested catchments of size ranging from 207 km2 to 9 852 km2 within the adige river basin in particular trend analysis see e g mann 1945 kendall 1975 hirsch et al 1982 was applied to hydro meteorological variables aggregated at the sub catchment scale and the comparison among observed changes allowed to detect spatial patterns of change and to identify the associated local drivers effects on streamflow in addition since the temporal patterns of precipitation and temperature are important determinants of the water budget long 1987 seasonal analysis was also performed in order to detect intra annual variations of the hydrological fluxes and to attribute them to season specific drivers temporal and spatial variability was explored at the finer scale that the measurements allowed by using daily data interpolated at a 1 km2 grid resolution furthermore correlation and multi regressive analyses were performed to identify relationships between changes in streamflow and possible concurrent drivers see e g huo et al 2008 harrigan et al 2014 the paper is organized as follows section 2 presents a short description of the study area and of the available hydro climatic data 2 1 and introduces the methods adopted for the analysis 2 2 2 3 2 4 2 5 results of trend analysis are presented in section 3 in section 4 the detected trends are attributed to relevant drivers finally discussion and conclusions are provided in section 5 2 material and methods 2 1 data we analyzed long term time series of hydrological data in the adige river basin a large alpine catchment located in southeastern alps north east of italy fig 1 the adige river rises at the resia pass 46 50 04 2 n 10 30 58 32 e and flows eastward to the city of bolzano and then south to the city of verona before turning to east again finally reaching the adriatic sea at rosolina a mare 45 09 44 64 n 12 19 47 64 e with a total water course of 420 km the long term average streamflow at the gauging station of boara pisani 52 km upstream the river mouth is of 202 m3s 1 which considering the contributing area of 11 738 km2 leads to a specific discharge of 17 21 l s 1 km 2 streamflow reaches its minimum in winter when precipitation within the catchment is at its seasonal minimum and chiefly as snow in the headwaters followed by a first maximum in early summer due to snow melting and a second one in autumn caused by intense cyclonic storms summers are typically wet and dominated by short and intense convective storms the annual average precipitation ranges from 500 mm in the north west to 1 600 mm in the southern part of the basin due to the wide elevation gradient and the humid climate the basin is well suited for hydropower exploitation which represents the dominant water use and the major cause of alteration of the natural hydrological regime in the catchment the majority of hydropower production is performed by 34 large hydropower plants with a total nominal power of 650 mw autorità di bacino del fiume adige 2008 chiogna et al 2016 we performed a detailed analysis of hydrological fluxes in the following four sub catchments of the adige river basin characterized by different climatic and water use conditions see fig 1 adige at the gauging stations of trento and bronzolo both located along the main stem the other two selected catchments are gadera at mantana and avisio at soraga both are headwaters and are located in the northeastern and southeastern part of the adige watershed respectively in the following for brevity we will refer to these catchments as trento bronzolo mantana and soraga respectively main hydro meteorological characteristics of the sub catchments are reported in table 1 time series of precipitation and air temperature were obtained from the meteorological offices of the provinces of trento meteotrentino http www meteotrentino it and bolzano http www provincia bz it meteo home as and the austrian weather service zamg http www zamg ac at air temperature daily average as well as maximum and minimum and daily precipitation data were available from 350 and 244 stations respectively since 1920 fig 2 shows both the locations panel a and the temporal availability panel b of the meteorological stations used in the present work notice that meteorological stations located outside the adige catchment were also used fig 2a in order to improve the estimates of precipitation and temperature fields at the catchment boundaries furthermore fig 2b highlights that the number of simultaneously active temperature stations during the investigation period 1956 2013 increased from 64 to 261 whereas precipitation stations increased from 125 to 190 during the period 1956 2000 and then decreased to 106 in 2013 as a consequence of the decommissioning of obsolete installations the impact on the results of changes in the number of active meteorological stations is discussed in details in section 3 1 daily streamflow data measured at the four selected gauging stations were provided by the hydrological offices of the autonomous provinces of trento http www floods it public and bolzano http www provincia bz it hydro these time series extend almost continuously over the period 1956 2013 with a very limited number of gaps and refer to sections with stable riverbeds where the rating curves were controlled periodically or did not change significantly during the recording period all the streamflow data used in the present work are official measurements by the river authority and not obtained from modeling data quality control was also performed on all available time series to remove the records considered not reliable according to the information provided by the authorities owning the data temporal changes in land use within the river basin were investigated using the corine dataset http www eea europa eu publications cor0 landcover which covers the years 1990 2000 2006 and 2012 2 2 interpolation of meteorological data the first step in performing the hydrological budget at the catchment scale is to obtain the spatial distribution of the climatic forcing i e precipitation and temperature from the point measurements available at the meteorological stations to this purpose daily precipitation as well as daily minimum maximum and mean temperatures were interpolated over a regular grid with size of 1 km preliminary evaluations showed that using a finer grid did not improve the accuracy of the estimates interpolation was performed by using both ordinary kriging ok and kriging with the external drift ked by using terrain elevation as secondary variable goovaerts 1997 details of the kriging algorithms are reported in the appendix a we preferred geostatistical interpolation to other interpolation schemes because it allows quantifying through the conditional mean and variance the probability distribution function pdf of the reference quantity at each estimation point see section 3 1 furthermore kriging is an exact interpolator in the sense that the estimated value is equal to the measured one at all the measurement points with the pdf reducing to a dirac delta function the estimation is obtained through a weighted linear combination of the measurements see appendix a weights assigned to the measurements reduce with the distance from the estimation point and may become negative when clustered measurements screen one to each other leading in some cases to non physical estimates such as negative precipitation to avoid such occurrence we reset negative and low weights to zero applying the correction method proposed by deutsch 1996 the remaining positive weights were rescaled such as to keep their sum to 1 as required to make the estimate unbiased notice that since our dataset was composed by a rather homogeneous distribution of meteorological stations see fig 2 only rarely the solution of the kriging system produced negative weights all these cases were recorded and carefully analyzed before accepting the interpolated values after weights correction interpolation was conducted by using measurements at the closest 8 16 and 32 meteorological stations assuming both exponential and spherical covariance functions thereby 12 independent estimates were obtained at each grid cell six with ok and six with ked in order to select the most suitable interpolation scheme and covariance model as well as the optimal number of neighboring stations a leave one out cross validation procedure was applied at daily time scale by comparing the average absolute errors of the independent estimates this procedure identified ked with 16 neighboring stations and exponential covariance model with nugget as the most suitable interpolation scheme for all the four variables precipitation mean maximum and minimum temperature the covariance function adopted in the ked was then 1 c r r σ n 2 δ r σ 2 exp 3 r a where r is the two point separation distance in eq 1 δ r epitomizes the nugget effect due to the lack of information at scales smaller than the shortest distance between pairs of measurement points and assumes the following expression δ r 1 if r 0 and δ r 0 otherwise notice that the nugget effect introduces a discontinuity in the covariance function at zero separation distance furthermore σ n 2 and σ 2 are the variances associated to scales smaller and larger than the minimum distance between measurements respectively finally the range a is the distance at which the covariance function is 5 of the value assumed at zero separation distance the values of the parameters of the optimal covariance function are reported in table 2 the mean of the absolute error provided by the cross validation resulted in 1 3 mm for daily precipitation and 0 02 c for mean as well as maximum and minimum daily temperature these values are in line with the findings of other studies in this region see e g laiti et al 2018 2 3 potential evapotranspiration model daily reference potential evapotranspiration et 0 was estimated cell by cell by using the hargreaves samani model see e g hargreaves and samani 1985 samani 2000 subedi and chávez 2015 eq 2 which we preferred to pennman montieth due to the very limited availability of meteorological data other than temperature and precipitation according to this model the daily potential evapotranspiration et 0 mm d 1 of a reference crop grass under standard conditions is given by 2 et 0 0 408 0 0023 ra td 0 50 t mean 17 8 where ra is the theoretical solar radiation mj m 2 d 1 which depends only on the location since the effect of topographic shadow and cloud cover is not considered td t max t min is the difference between the daily maximum and minimum temperature c and t mean is the daily mean temperature c potential evapotranspiration was then obtained by multiplying et 0 by the crop coefficient k c allen et al 1998 et p 0 7 k c et 0 with k c depending on the site specific vegetation and growth stage and hence varying in space and time following hargreaves 1994 allen et al 1998 and pat 2006 the 0 7 multiplication factor was applied in the expression of et p in order to counterbalance the tendency of eq 2 to overestimate et 0 under non standard conditions i e the standard conditions require well watered soils and disease free crops et p represents the upper limit of actual evapotranspiration since soil water content and atmospheric conditions e g wind cloudiness humidity may reduce the amount of water that crops and vegetation actually absorb mcmahon et al 2013 therefore climatic actual evapotranspiration aet clim was computed as follows aet clim α et p where α 1 is a stress factor reducing the potential evapotranspiration under these conditions the annual water budget assumes the following form 3 p q α et p w δ v 0 where p mm is the precipitation q mm is the streamflow volume α et p mm is the climatic actual evapotranspiration i e aet clim w mm is the volume of water uses not re entering the catchment after withdrawal and δ v mm is the change of water storage notice that all these variables were first aggregated spatially at the level of the sub basin and then temporally at the annual scale in this study we considered solar years for the annual aggregation of hydrological fluxes the water stress factor α was estimated by applying the water budget 3 in the period 1920 1950 when the effects of climate change were not evident and water consumption was negligible zolezzi et al 2009 notice that in this work we define the effects of climate change as the alterations of hydrological quantities that cannot be considered neither cyclic nor associated to water uses in particular we applied the water budget eq 3 in the time window 1920 1950 for the adige catchment closed at trento taking advantage of the long term historical streamflow data available at this gauging station therefore assuming the catchment in equilibrium δ v 0 and negligible water consumptions w 0 the long term average of eq 3 leads to the following expression for α 4 α p q et p where the bar over the symbols indicates the long term average in the period 1920 1950 storage in hydropower reservoirs is filtered out from the mean eq 4 because inter annual storage is very limited such as the amount of water withdrawn to feed hydropower plants in conterminous catchments zolezzi et al 2009 a similar approach was used by destouni et al 2013 and levi et al 2015 in swedish and balkan catchments other methods for estimating α are discussed by lyra et al 2016 the value of α obtained from eq 4 provides a reliable estimate of actual evapotranspiration in eq 3 also for the period successive to 1950 when water uses and climate change effects are not longer negligible and under the assumption that α does not change by assuming a constant α the time variability of water losses from evapotranspiration is assumed proportional to the climatic forcing in addition jarsjö et al 2008 have shown that a single multiplication factor captures accurately the aet variability around its overall average level temporally as well as spatially within a catchment in order to evaluate the uncertainty associated to the estimate of α we performed a sensitivity analysis by applying a non parametric bootstrap technique see e g efron and tibshirani 1994 based on random resampling with replacement of all the terms of eq 4 we used 10 000 random resamplings obtaining for α a mean value of 0 70 and a standard deviation of 0 045 the low value of the standard deviation confirms that α 0 70 is a reliable estimate disentangling w from δ v is more complicated and requires site specific analyses that will be detailed later 2 4 mann kendall trend analysis time series of the aforementioned hydrological variables p et p were calculated at each cell of the grid following the procedure described in sections 2 2 and 2 3 and then aggregated over the drainage area of the four selected sub catchments successively after deriving the stress factor α as shown in section 2 3 trends of p α et p and q were calculated by applying the mann kendall test see e g mann 1945 kendall 1975 hirsch et al 1982 with a significance level of 0 1 for both annual and seasonal aggregations and a moving time window of 30 years the width of the moving window was selected for mitigating the effects of short term fluctuations typical of natural cyclic fluctuations see e g zolezzi et al 2009 szolgayova et al 2014 this filtering effect should not conceal the anthropogenic impact which is typically non cyclic and the long term fluctuations i e more than 30 years which we assumed are chiefly due to climate change see e g houghton et al 2001 the choice of 30 years as the width of the time windows for the computation of trends is based on the sensitivity analysis reported in the appendix b kendall s rank correlations were performed through the r statistical software package kendall by kendall 2011 2 5 auxiliary statistical methods the spearman s rank correlation spearman 1904 was calculated separately for each selected driver to estimate the level of correlation between tho observed hydrological alterations and the possible drivers as a quantitative measure of the influence and relative importance of the processes controlling the hydrological alterations we employed the one way analysis of variance anova with a linear model see e g chambers and hastie 1992 this technique allows to assess the relative weights of concurrent drivers by estimating the share of variance of a selected hydrological alteration that can be attributed to each of these factors these analyses were performed by using the r statistical software package stats and anova was applied with a significance level of p 0 05 3 trend detection 3 1 uncertainty of precipitation estimation in alpine regions a major source of uncertainty in the water budget is the smoothing and in some cases the bias introduced by interpolating precipitations measured at the meteorological stations weingartner et al 2007 laiti et al 2018 preliminary data analysis showed that the average distance among temperature stations is much smaller than the integral scale i e 4 3 km against 18 km as shown in previous studies see e g bellin et al 1992 four points per integral scale suffice to obtain a good reproduction of a random function in addition the average of the absolute error obtained by applying the leave one out cross validation method goovaerts 1997 section 4 2 4 was 0 02 c a small value not affecting the evapotranspiration estimates following these considerations and according to a number of studies in different climatic areas see e g hofstra et al 2009 laiti et al 2018 we decided to neglect temperature uncertainty since it is typically small compared to that of precipitation at the catchment scale such as its effect on streamflow in the present work we evaluated the uncertainty introduced by the spatialization of point measurements of precipitation assumed as free of errors because of the high reliability of available data and the lack of information on the errors in the precipitation measurements phillips and marks 1996 conditional mean and variance the former representing the optimal estimation in the mean square sense were obtained by using ked with the n 16 meteorological stations closest to the estimation point see section 2 2 in doing that the searching neighborhood changes according to the local density of the gauging stations and may include stations outside the catchment of interest under the assumption that the quantity of interest is distributed according to a parametric probability distribution fully characterized by the first two moments estimation uncertainty at a given point is obtained by simply replacing the first two conditional moments i e the conditional mean and the conditional variance into the expression of the pdf in line with previous studies see e g coe and stern 1982 wilks 1989 wilks 1990 hofstra et al 2009 we adopted the gamma distribution for the days with more than 1 mm of precipitation wet days which density function is the following 5 f z 1 γ k θ k z k 1 exp z θ z k θ 0 where z is a realization of the random variable z i e daily precipitation k is the shape parameter and θ is the scale parameter the parameters k and θ are related to the first two moments μ z and σ z 2 as follows 6 k μ z 2 σ z 2 θ σ z 2 μ z therefore at each point x 0 of the interpolation grid the pdf of the variable z eq 5 is obtained by replacing into eq 6 μ z and σ z 2 with the conditional mean z x 0 and the conditional variance σ z c 2 x 0 respectively both provided by ked see eqs a 2 and a 4 in the appendix a the choice of the gamma distribution was supported by the pearson s chi squared test applied to the precipitation time series available at each station all the stations passed the statistical test with an average p value of 0 003 the selection of ked as geostatistical interpolator and its parameters was already discussed in section 2 2 we quantified the uncertainty affecting the estimates of the spatial mean precipitation at a given sub catchment by performing 5 000 monte carlo simulations of the precipitation time series at each grid cell of the study domain which were proven to be enough to obtain convergence of the first two statistical moments at each monte carlo realization the conditional pdfs of the variable of interest were sampled to extract at each node of the grid a random value conditional through ked to the measurements then we aggregated the estimates over the four selected sub catchments in order to derive the average annual precipitation time series and the associated statistics of error we also verified that the standard deviation of the estimate averaged over the entire domain of interest did not change significantly in time e g it slightly reduced from 4 8 mm in the former decade 1956 1965 to 4 3 mm in the intermediate decade 1980 1989 and to 4 1 mm in the last decade 2004 2013 thereby highlighting a small to negligible effect of the variation over time in the number of stations with available data the analysis also revealed that the uncertainty bounds in the annual estimates of precipitation here defined as the average distances between the upper and lower limits of the 90 confidence interval of the annual estimates were narrow for all the investigated sub catchments and equal to 2 2 mm at trento 2 7 mm at bronzolo 11 7 mm at mantana and 15 4 mm at soraga against mean annual values of 911 8 mm 883 5 mm 921 7 mm and 1 034 9 mm for the same catchments headwaters i e gadera at mantana and avisio at soraga show higher uncertainty than the larger catchments at bronzolo and trento because of the lack of meteorological stations at high elevation however in all cases the amplitude of the 90 confidence interval was lower than 1 5 of the average annual precipitation therefore demonstrating that uncertainty introduced by the spatialization of precipitation has no appreciable effects on the annual water budget 3 2 analysis of spatial distribution of hydro meteorological data the long term averages 1956 2013 of annual precipitation annual mean temperature and climatic actual evapotranspiration were evaluated at the center of the cells obtained by dividing the adige river basin into a regular grid with spacing of 1 km the resulting fields are shown in fig 3 the annual average precipitation panel a ranges from 500 mm in the north west i e val venosta to 1 600 mm in the south east of the basin typical climatic characteristics of the region as well as the orographic effect in the north east were clearly captured as expected the orographic effect is much more pronounced for the temperature panel b with the long term annual mean that reduces from about 15 c in the deep valleys to 0 c along the mountain crests the climatic actual evapotranspiration aet clim panel c was gridded by aggregating at the annual scale the daily values of the et p multiplied by α see section 2 3 as expected a strong orographic effect is observed for this variable with an evident clear reduction from south to north finally the water yield p α et p which represents the potential streamflow generation is shown in panel d notice that water yield does not account for snow accumulation and melting across different years as expected the water yield is higher in the headwaters whereas in the valley bottoms much of the precipitation is needed to satisfy evapotranspiration demand the time series of streamflow volume q precipitation p climatic actual evapotranspiration aet clim and water yield p aet clim at the annual time scale are shown in fig 4 all quantities are aggregated at the four gauging stations of trento bronzolo mantana and soraga panels a b c and d respectively as customary the volume is normalized with respect to the catchment area hence it is expressed in mm the precipitation behaves similarly in all catchments varying between 600 mm and 1 400 mm except in the upper avisio where it is consistently higher than in the other sub catchments the annual climatic actual evapotranspiration is relatively small and varies between 200 and 300 mm without appreciable trends despite the large difference in the drainage areas and in their mean elevation see table 1 the time series of annual streamflow volume are similar at all the gauging stations and show large temporal variations between a minimum of 400 mm to a maximum of 1 200 mm the water yield mimics streamflow but showing relevant differences which investigation is indeed the main objective of the present study from the year 2000 onward at the gauging station of trento fig 4a the water yield is always larger than streamflow a similar behavior is observed at bronzolo fig 4b though with less pronounced differences similarly but from 2007 onward water yields exceeds streamflow at both gauging stations of mantana and soraga 3 3 trend analysis trend analysis was conducted at seasonal and annual time scales by using the mann kendall test see section 2 4 with the significance level set to 0 1 since trends change with time overlapping moving time windows of 30 years with origins from 1956 to 1984 were used and the trends were computed sliding the window of one year at a time the resulting trends are shown in fig 5 a d the summer season is between june and august in order to include most of the snow and glacier melting period for the purpose of the manuscript this is equivalent to assume the hydrological year as reference at annual scale relatively large trends though not always statistically significant are observed for precipitation p and streamflow volume q while climatic actual evapotranspiration aet clim shows a small positive trend at most 2 mm year 1 with statistical significance extending over longer periods precipitation trends are similar in all the sub catchments except for the upper avisio soraga see fig 5 panel d where large positive trends of about 7 mm year 1 are observed in the period 1967 2003 statistically not significant trends either positive or negative are detected in all the other sub catchments with significant positive trends localized in time occurring locally as for example between 1971 and 2001 in the northern portion of the river basin closed at the gauging station of bronzolo a slight general upward trend in precipitation for the whole adige river basin was detected by lutz et al 2016 during the period 1971 2010 and also by beniston et al 1994 and scherrer et al 2015 with reference to a number of swiss alpine catchments during the past century streamflow volumes q follow only partially the observed trends in precipitation the adige experiences a significant reduction of the streamflow at trento in the period 1975 2009 with a trend of about 9 mm year 1 whereas at bronzolo streamflow does not show any particular trend however in the small nested sub catchments of gadera at mantana and avisio at soraga streamflows show positive trends in the range 4 6 mm year 1 from 1971 onwards in the former and up to 10 mm year 1 from 1970 to 2005 in the latter different behaviors are observed for the terms of the water budget aggregated at the seasonal scale as illustrated in fig 6 climatic actual evapotranspiration shows negligible trends in all seasons except in summer when they are slightly positive trends in precipitation vary across the seasons though with patterns similar in all the nested sub catchments in fact significant negative trends are observed in winter during the period 1970 2010 with maximum reduction of about 4 mm year 1 in spring trends are positive and statistically significant in the first part of the study period whereas from the 70s negative trends prevail summer precipitations are nearly constant no significant trends in the whole study period at all locations autumn precipitation trends are first negative and become positive in the period 1970 2000 this is more evident in the upper avisio catchment closed at soraga where positive trends of about 7 mm year 1 can be observed similarly to what is observed at the annual scale seasonal streamflow volumes vary in space in the last 30 years winter trends were nearly absent at trento gauging station and slightly positive at bronzolo conversely significant positive trends characterize winter streamflow in the other two nested sub catchments since the 70s notice that winter streamflow trends are often opposite to the trends of precipitation in the same season indicating a complex response of the river basin to changes of the climatic forcing see section 4 in spring trends in precipitation and streamflow are more consistent significant negative trends are observed for summer streamflow starting from the 70s especially at trento gauging station where negative trends of about 6 mm year 1 are detected in the period 1977 2007 as in winter these patterns do not reflect changes in precipitation finally autumn trends in streamflow are higher in the small nested sub catchments of gadera at mantana and avisio at soraga than in the adige at trento and bronzolo located along the main stem of the adige river and with a much larger contributing area in this season increasing trends in the avisio at soraga amount to a maximum of 5mm year 1 patterns of autumn streamflow at all the investigated locations are similar to that of precipitation in the same season the complex interplay between drivers of change and observed trends will be analyzed in the ensuing section 4 trend attribution in this section the statistically significant changes in streamflow detected in section 3 3 are attributed to selected drivers by means of a multi method framework seeking for evidence of consistency or evidence of inconsistency see e g merz et al 2012 in particular mann kendall trend test spearman s rank correlation and analysis of variance were used to investigate the following detected changes i the reduction of summer streamflow of the adige at trento and bronzolo and ii the increase of winter streamflow in the gadera and upper avisio catchments although previous studies identified similar changes in other alpine regions see e g birsan et al 2005 kormann et al 2015 they did not explore the combined effect of climate change and water uses here we analyze such interplay with reference to the adige river which is large enough to be considered representative of the southern part of the european alps a summary of the drivers evaluated in the attribution exercise is shown in table 3 4 1 attribution of decreasing summer streamflow at large scale since the 2000s the annual streamflow volume experienced a reduction at the gauging station of trento chiefly due to a large reduction of summer streamflows a similar reduction was observed also at the upstream section of bronzolo see fig 4 though much weaker and insufficient to induce a significant negative trend as can be seen in fig 5b here we consider five possible drivers of the observed change at trento a1 reduction of summer precipitation a2 higher summer evapotranspiration as a consequence of air temperature warming a3 shrinkage of the glaciers providing less water during summer melting a4 increase of water uses other than hydropower a5 reduction of winter snow the drivers a1 a2 a3 and a5 are consequences of climate change whereas the driver a4 is the result of the anthropogenic impact unfortunately the lack of reliable data on changes of water uses hinders a direct attribution and therefore we proceeded by elimination of causes that are inconsistent with the observed changes see e g merz et al 2012 we decided to exclude hydropower use from the list of the possible drivers since operational rules are such as to limit seasonal accumulation autorità di bacino del fiume adige 2008 which in addition shows a small to negligible inter annual variability pat 2007 thereby suggesting a negligible influence on the observed trends attribution was performed by considering for both drivers and streamflow time series the evolution in time of the trends over moving windows of 30 years calculated following the procedure presented in section 3 3 in particular we did not employ the daily time series of the drivers in order to avoid the effect that gaps in the data presence of outliers and measurement error may have on the evaluation of the possible correlations between streamflow and drivers themselves this is in line with the findings of goodwin and leech 2006 which suggest the use of transformed variables to reduce the emergence of mistaken correlation fig 7 shows the trends of the summer hydrological fluxes of the catchment contributing to the gauging station of trento left panel starting from 1974 streamflow trends are negative and statistically significant filled blue bullets and this occurs despite the trends of precipitation are positive and increasing though statistically not significant therefore the option a1 should be discarded because the changes of summer precipitation are opposite to the changes in streamflow moreover also the hypothesis a2 cannot be invoked as possible cause of summer streamflow reduction given that the magnitude of trends in aet clim green bullets is much smaller than that of streamflow the following evidences suggest to exclude also glacier melting hypothesis a3 from the possible drivers as melting proceeds the runoff generated by the glaciers in the adige catchment is determined by two contrasting effects the increase of the melting rate in terms of water equivalent lost each year by the glaciers and the contemporaneous reduction of the surface see e g knoll and kerschner 2009 there are evidences that in the period considered in the present study these two contrasting effects were almost in equilibrium in particular haeberli et al 2007 reported the melting rate of 9 alpine glaciers which intensified significantly from the 80s reaching 0 7 m year 1 in the decade 1985 1994 and 0 8 m year 1 in the following decade 1995 2004 the total glaciers area in these two decades can be estimated as that registered in the middle years of the time windows which is 151 km2 in the year 1990 and 129 km2 in the year 2000 these estimates were obtained from the inventory by knoll and kerschner 2009 for the bolzano province and by using the corine land cover information for the trentino province http www eea europa eu publications cor0 landcover hence the average annual runoff generated by the glaciers at trento occurring mostly in summer results in 10 7 mm in the decade 1985 1994 and to 10 5 mm in the following period 1995 2004 both are less than 5 of the summer runoff at the trento gauging station 240 mm considering that the middle of the two considered time windows is 10 years apart the trend can be estimated to be 0 02 mm year 1 which is within the margin of error of the estimate of 2 mm year 1 obtained by trend analysis of summer runoff at trento see fig 7 left panel these calculations are based on published data see haeberli et al 2007 knoll and kerschner 2009 and show that an increased rate of melting offsets the reduction in runoff caused by the glaciers shrinkage leading to a negligible contribution to the overall trend data scarcity impedes to include glaciers melting as a driver in a formal analysis however given the above evidences of its marginal influence on the observed reduction of summer streamflow at trento we excluded it from the possible drivers the effect of snowmelting i e the runoff produced by the snow accumulated in the previous winter will be considered explicitly as a driver in the following hypothesis a5 conversely the hypothesis a4 is coherent with the data of apple production in the middle and lower noce valley in fact despite analysis of land cover changes as retrieved by corine maps showed little variations in the agricultural land use of the adige river basin the maps show a reduction of about 0 2 in the period 1990 2006 starting from the 70s apple production almost doubled from 69 to about 130 tons in about 10 years zanon 1978 in italian unfortunately a direct attribution exercise was impossible due to the absence of information on water uses by the agricultural sector however the limit of 0 05 m3 s 1 km 2 to water use enforced since 2006 in the agricultural sector together with financial incentives to change the irrigation system from sprinkler to drip irrigation pat 2006 parte viii may have contributed to the attenuation of the negative trend observed from 1977 onward since streamflow changes in the years after 2006 influences the trends successive to 1976 years after 2006 enters in the time windows with origin successive to 1977 in addition the trend analysis of standard deviation of summer streamflow mcmahon et al 2007 suggests that observed changes in this period can be attributed to a component that varies slowly in time since from the 70s negative trends of streamflow standard deviation are less pronounced than those of streamflow itself result shown in fig 6 a similar behavior though much weaker was observed at the upstream section of bronzolo fig 7 right panel this behavior is consistent with the intensification of apple production in the noce catchment contributing to the adige river downstream of bronzolo which was accompanied by an increased water use in late spring and summer during the apple growing season nevertheless according to the available data on water concessions pat 2006 parte iii water uses in the noce catchment are less than 9m3 s 1 which is minor than the maximum observed reduction of summer streamflow at trento compared to bronzolo i e about 20m3 s 1 between 1980 and 2010 hence despite an influence of the hypothesis a4 on the summer streamflow alterations cannot be excluded at large scale we argue that other drivers of change should act concurrently the remaining hypothesized driver a5 is the reduction in winter snow accumulation which entails diminished streamflow contribution from snow melting in the following warm season the time series of accumulated snow water equivalent was estimated by subtracting at each estimation point the precipitation of rainy days from the total precipitation a day is classified as rainy when with a precipitation larger than 0 1 mm and with a mean temperature higher than 0 c in particular we observed that the trends in winter snow black squares in fig 7 are coherent with those of streamflow especially at bronzolo right panel for which the magnitudes of significant trends are very similar hence besides the water uses for irrigation in summer a4 also the reduction of winter snow a5 exerts a strong control on streamflow reduction in the following summer season in order to quantify the relative influence of the analyzed drivers the spearman s rank correlation and the one way analysis of variance anova were applied to the time series of the trends see section 2 5 computed as described in section 3 3 spearman s rank correlation analysis confirmed that summer streamflow trends in the adige at trento and bronzolo were not significantly correlated with a significance level of 0 05 neither with the trends in summer precipitation a1 r 4 5 10 1 and r 6 6 10 2 for trento and bronzolo respectively nor with the trends in summer evapotranspiration a2 r 1 6 10 1 and r 4 5 10 1 for trento and bronzolo respectively conversely strong significant correlation was found with the trends in winter snow a5 r 8 5 10 1 and r 7 5 10 1 for trento and bronzolo respectively anova was applied considering the trends in summer streamflow as dependent variable and the available time series of the trends in the drivers as independent variables a1 a2 and a5 after verifying that the errors are independent and normally distributed we were able to estimate the share of variance of the trends in summer streamflow attributable to each one of these factors in both large scale catchments the most important factor was the reduction of winter snow with a share of variance of 77 and 56 for trento and bronzolo respectively significance probability p 0 05 the residual variance not explained by the selected drivers was of 9 and 29 at trento and bronzolo respectively this leaves room for considering agricultural water uses to contribute though to a much lesser extent than winter precipitation to the reduction of streamflow observed in the last two decades 4 2 attribution of increasing winter streamflow at the headwaters trend analysis of observed time series detected a significant change of winter streamflow at the headwaters of gadera at mantana and avisio at soraga fig 8a and b respectively here land and water uses differ with respect to the adige river basin at bronzolo and trento for instance the gadera catchment mantana is free of reservoirs and the upper avisio soraga includes only the fedaia reservoir in the upper part of the catchment which receives water from the marmolada glacier in addition the agricultural land in the latter catchment is very limited table 1 evapotranspiration here is lower than the average of the adige catchment because of the lower temperatures and the absence of crops see the western part of the basin in fig 3c fig 8 also shows that while winter streamflow increased winter precipitation showed the opposite trend in addition evapotranspiration did not change during the observation period to attribute the detected changes in winter streamflow at the headwaters we considered here three hypotheses b1 increased snow and glacier melting as a consequence of air temperature warming b2 increasing winter liquid precipitation rainfall induced by warmer temperatures b3 change in groundwater dynamics reflecting shifts in the seasonal distribution of precipitation as in section 4 1 all the time series are considered in terms of trends over moving time windows of 30 years glacier melting b1 is not likely to provide the excess of water in the global budget in fact although the marmolada glacier shrank in the last century crepaz et al 2009 in italian streamflow produced by the glacier which has an area of about 3 3 km2 is first stored in the fedaia reservoir and then diverted to the cordevole river a tributary of the piave river east of the adige catchment for hydropower production enel 1974 del fiume adige 2008 pat 2012 a partial shift of winter precipitation from solid to liquid b2 is the hypothesis suggested by birsan et al 2005 and bocchiola 2014 in studies on swiss and italian alpine catchments respectively projected increases in winter streamflow for high altitude first order streams in switzerland with glaciers in their catchment are discussed also by bavay et al 2013 and explained by an increasing number of snow melting events in winter and by precipitation falling as rain instead of snow due to the higher air temperature scenarios provided in the time frames 2021 2050 and 2070 2095 similar results are reported in majone et al 2016 for the noce catchment with reference to the time frame 2040 2070 nevertheless this is hardly the cause of the observed increase of winter streamflow in the past decades in the upper avisio because winter temperature was rather slightly decreasing i e 0 02 c year 1 in this catchment given that data about variations in time of the snow cover was not available over the whole study period we analyzed the changes in the surface area above the freezing level i e altitude at which average daily temperature is equal to 0 c assuming that it represents an approximation of the land surface potentially covered by snow the rationale behind this is the hypothesis that an increase in temperature would reduce the freezing days while enlarging the area of the catchment in which winter precipitation falls as rainfall thereby increasing streamflow in particular we analyzed the behavior of the number of days with mean temperature below 0 c as a function of the area expressed as percentage of the total catchment area for a few decades from 1960 to 2010 see fig 9 a starting from the 90s the curves show an increase in the number of freezing days at high elevations i e for small areas which contrasts the reduction of the number of freezing days at low elevations a similar result was found by stewart 2009 at global scale fig 9a also suggests that the number of freezing days reduced at elevations below 1 500 m a s l corresponding to about 40 of the river basin the reduction of freezing days at relatively low elevations was confirmed by several large scale studies chiefly based on the analysis of time series at middle low elevation stations see e g brunetti et al 2006 in addition marcolini et al 2017 identified a larger reduction of average snow depth and snow cover duration for the stations in the adige catchment located below 1 650 m a s l than for those located at higher elevation in the last decades consequently the rise in winter streamflow volume cannot be attributed to a shift of winter precipitation from solid to liquid given that the number of days mainly in the winter season with temperature below freezing increased in about 60 of the catchment area which includes the typical elevations of both gadera and upper avisio catchments see table 1 analysis of freezing days of the avisio catchment upstream soraga see fig 9b confirmed the previous result showing that a large part of the mountainous areas and the valleys located at high elevations experienced a reduction of air temperature i e increasing number of freezing days in the past decades conversely in swiss watersheds where more than half of the land surface is above 1 000 m a s l birsan et al 2005 observed in the period 1961 2000 a substantial reduction of the number of days with minimum daily air temperature below 0 c attribution was performed by means of correlation analysis between the trends of observed winter streamflows at mantana and soraga and the time series of the hypothesized drivers i intensification of snow and glacier melting contribution b1 ii shift from solid to liquid precipitation in winter b2 and iii increase of autumn aquifer recharge b3 as a proxy for snow and glacier melting contribution b1 we considered the time evolution of the number of winter days with the mean air temperature above a threshold temperature for which snowpack melts this threshold is typically adopted in simplified degree day snow models which require air temperature as the only parameter rango and martinec 1995 hock 2003 majone et al 2010 we fixed the threshold at 3 c which is the value inferred by laiti et al 2018 through hydrological modeling conducted in the adige river basin similarly winter liquid precipitation b2 was obtained from the winter precipitation data by subtracting for each estimation point the volumes recorded during the freezing days i e with mean daily temperature below 0 c when precipitation is supposed to fall as snow finally hypothesis b3 was verified by assuming that the time series of the changes in autumn aquifer recharge can be approximated with the time series of the residuals δ v as retrieved from water budget eq 3 in doing this we have also implicitly assumed that for these sub catchments water uses w are marginal spearman s rank correlation analysis highlighted that winter streamflow trends in the gadera at mantana and avisio at soraga were not significantly correlated with a significance level of 0 05 neither with the change in snow and glacier melting b1 r 4 9 10 2 and r 8 4 10 3 for mantana and soraga respectively nor with the dynamics of changing phase of precipitation b2 r 2 4 10 1 and r 4 4 10 1 for mantana and soraga respectively these considerations led to the conclusion that the rise of winter streamflow in these two headwater catchments was caused by other factors than the changes in the winter precipitation characteristics and the direct consequences of changing temperature in a recent study zampieri et al 2015 observed that changes of seasonality in precipitation play a major role in streamflows alterations particularly for the earlier spring streamflow over most of the alps in our case we made the hypothesis that the surplus of precipitation in autumn enters groundwater where it resides longer than in the other hydrological compartments i e surficial waters to finally contribute to winter streamflow this hypothesis is confirmed by the analysis of the standard deviation of winter streamflow see fig 6 in fact if the increase of winter streamflow was due to the increase of winter rainfall the standard deviation of streamflow would rise in proportion mcmahon et al 2007 however this was not the case since the standard deviation did not change remaining smaller than in all the other seasons thereby corroborating the hypothesis of increasing baseflow as the main cause of raising streamflow furthermore spearman s rank correlation revealed significant positive correlation between the trends in autumn aquifer recharge and the increase of winter streamflow r 0 86 for the gadera at mantana and r 0 64 for the avisio at soraga to provide a quantitative measure of the influence and relative importance of the possible controlling factors we applied a one way analysis of variance anova see section 2 5 with the trends in winter streamflow as dependent variable and the trends in the three possible drivers as independent variables after verifying that the errors are independent and normally distributed we were able to estimate the share of variance of the trends in winter streamflow attributable to each one of these factors in both headwater catchments the significance probability p is lower than 0 05 only for the variable assumed as proxy for autumn aquifer recharge i e p 10 8 on the contrary the shift from solid to liquid precipitation in winter and the intensification of snow and glacier melting play a negligible role being characterized by p 0 05 hence the only plausible reason of the increasing winter streamflow in the two investigated sub catchments is the increased autumn contribution in aquifer recharge 5 discussion and conclusions attribution of hydrological changes to multiple drivers is in general a complex procedure requiring much more effort than the case in which a single driver is considered data availability constitutes a main limitation since it is often scarce in time and space and affected by multiple sources of uncertainty nonetheless this additional effort is necessary to understand the non linear interactions and feedbacks between hydrological alterations and the forces driving them see e g kormann et al 2015 modeling could be used in theory to simulate hydrological and anthropogenic quantities like e g land use change over time not available in the region of investigation and thus to quantify the relative importance of the different drivers provided that suitable models can be reliably set up however this advantage is counterbalanced by the additional source of uncertainty that is involved in the parameterizations of such models and in the simplifications adopted to conceptualize the system dynamics on the contrary the data driven approach proposed in this work does not suffer from this limitation focusing the analyses on observed time series of detected changes and possible drivers we acknowledge that this approach is advisable for trend detection and attribution analyses to be performed in regions presenting sufficient data availability measured data could be eventually supplemented by appropriate proxies see e g kundzewicz and robson 2004 which however could introduce in the attribution exercise additional uncertainty if any modeling is needed in the proxies evaluation in the present work we analyzed long term time series of daily climatic and hydrological variables in the adige river basin an important alpine river basin in the north east of italy trends of climatic forcing variables hydrological fluxes and storage term in the water budget were computed and compared in four nested sub catchments of the river basin thereafter we employed a multi method approach in which inferential statistics techniques were used to test concurrent hypotheses for a rigorous identification of the drivers of hydrological change in particular the attribution of the observed alterations to their main causes was performed by providing evidences of consistency or inconsistency of different plausible hypotheses following the approach proposed by merz et al 2012 the analyses evidenced temporal patterns differentiated within the river basin depending on the reciprocal strength of water uses and their changes in time and climate change in particular two main changes were detected in the streamflow time series i a reduction of summer streamflow of the adige at trento and ii an increase of winter streamflow in the gadera and upper avisio catchments a summary of the attribution exercise is shown in table 3 in the two headwaters positive trends in winter streamflow are detected at the gauging stations of gadera at mantana and avisio at soraga which are observed also at the annual scale despite an evident reduction of winter precipitation accurate trend analysis spearman s rank correlation and multivariate analysis of variance revealed that this change cannot be attributed neither to an increased winter snow and glacier melting nor to a shift of winter precipitation from solid to liquid but rather to a larger groundwater contribution triggered by a proportional increase of groundwater recharge in autumn due to larger precipitation this is the stigma of climate change given that headwaters are only marginally impacted by agricultural activities and seasonal storage for hydropower is very limited this effect vanishes as the drainage area increases moving downstream with only a marginal increase of winter streamflow observed at the bronzolo and trento gauging stations on the contrary in the southern part of the river basin decreasing winter snow is the main driver of streamflow reduction possibly supplemented by increasing water uses in agriculture the latter are mainly caused by an intense development of irrigated agriculture since the 70s in the drainage area of the noce river a tributary of the adige the former although it is present in the whole adige river basin affects only the summer streamflows at large scale to summarize besides a possible partial contribution of agricultural water uses at large scale climate change is the main driver of recent changes and it manifests itself in different ways according to the scale of study in particular in headwater basins the larger autumn precipitation entails increasing winter streamflow whereas the reduction of winter snow implies decreasing summer streamflow but only at the large scale we remark that the attribution of hydrological trends to their causes should be made with caution and need to be supported by compelling evidences despite several attempts have been made with different methodologies for separating the anthropogenic and climatic components of hydrological alterations a standard procedure is not available and a multi method approach as the one presented in this work represents in our view a comprehensive and rigorous methodology that can be relevant to attribution studies conducted in areas experiencing comparable changes of the hydrological cycle acknowledgments this research received financial support by the

measurements z x i located at x i i 1 n x 0 a 1 z x 0 m x 0 i 1 n x 0 λ i x 0 z x i m x i where λ i x 0 is the weight assigned to the measurement z x i and m is the local mean m x 0 at the estimation location x 0 and m x i at position x i several forms of geostatistical interpolation are available depending on the model of spatial variability for the mean in the simple kriging sk the mean is constant and known m x m constant x in the ordinary kriging ok the mean is constant but unknown m x constant for x x 0 x x i for i 1 n x 0 in the kriging with a trend model kt the unknown mean m x smoothly varies within each local neighborhood as a linear combination of functions f k x of the coordinates such that m x a 0 x k 1 k a k x f k x where the coefficients a 0 x are constant and unknown the kriging with external drift ked is a variant of kt since the trend m x is modeled as a linear function of a smoothly varying second variable y x m x a 0 x a 1 x y x in this case the estimate shown in eq a 1 can be written as follows a 2 z x 0 i 1 n x 0 λ i x 0 z x i and the system of n x 0 2 linear equations providing the n x 0 weights λ i x 0 i 1 n x 0 to be used into eq a 2 assumes the

which are introduced in order to minimize the variance of the error z x 0 z x 0 under unbiased constraints see goovaerts 1997 section 5 1 for a statistically stationary random function the covariance function c r x i x j depends only on the two point separation distance i e c r x i x j c r x i x j in this work the variable y used for the trend model is the terrain elevation the standard deviation of the estimation error is given by sd z x 0 σ z c 2 x 0 where σ z c 2 x 0 is the minimized error variance i e the variance of the random variable z conditional to the n x 0 measurements a 4 σ z c 2 x

goovaerts 1997 for additional information of these and other types of geostatistical interpolation we refer to the book by goovaerts 1997 appendix b selection of the time window width for the computation of trends the rationale for the selection of 30 years moving time window was in the attempt to mitigate the effects of short term fluctuations typical of natural cyclic fluctuations however some authors e g kundzewicz and robson 2004 spence and brown 2016 warn that apparent trends may result in case of short record lengths suggesting the use of time windows longer than 50 years in order to discuss the possible effects on trends detection embedded in the selection of a different moving time window we decided to perform a sensitivity analysis by changing progressively the width of the time window itself in particular we computed the trends of streamflow q actual climatic evapotranspiration aet clim and precipitation p for the adige at trento gauging station by considering moving time windows ranging from 3 years to the whole record length i e 58 years the results of such analysis are reported in fig b 10 where each pixel of the matrices represents the value of trend computed on a time window whose starting and finish years are indicated in the horizontal and vertical axes respectively we notice how the trends computed over short time windows pixel close to the diagonals are of higher magnitude brighter colors and change sign quickly on the contrary trends computed over longer time windows far from the diagonal near to the top left corners are more attenuated and stable in time we also notice that trends associated to all three variables for time windows larger than 30 years i e our selection see also the dashed gray lines indicated by the black arrows in fig b 10 do not present any scattering in the sign of the trend though as expected the magnitude slightly decrease as a consequence of the smoothing effect induced by a larger time window from our point view these results indicate that the selection of 30 years as time window is optimal in the sense that it is short enough to appreciate the changes of trends over time and at the same time it is long enough to filter out cyclic fluctuations associated to shorter periods appendix c supplementary data supplementary data associated with this article can be found in the online version
