21850,oil spill may happen as a result of the offshore well vessel failures the precise information about the location and real time situation of the oil spill is essential to perform an efficient treatment of these environmental catastrophes a novel approach of multi robot s system which can navigate autonomously and track oil spill on the sea surfaces this system is able to self adapt and path plan amidst environmental changes including the temporospatial variation of the oil concentration the method consists of two main parts which are the modelling of the oil spill the tracking system and autonomous control of the robots the simulated model depicts the morphological complexities of the spatiotemporal changes in the oil spills the fuzzy controller is designed to control the robots to control nonlinear and non crisply distributed water surfaces where oil pollution occurs meanwhile the multi robot path planning system hybridised with artificial potential field approach to avoid the collision several numerical simulations with different scenarios are done to show the robustness of the methods based on the accuracy and precision of tracking the evaluation with the simulated ground truth demonstrates that accuracy and precision of the tracking system are more than 70 and 80 percent respectively keywords autonomous surface vehicles asv oil spill multi robot

2015 the labour intensity signifies when the search and observation domain is considerably expanded and the target environmental attributes are spatially and temporally variable environment monitoring encompasses a series of measurement sampling in order to create a map of observation that can visualise or describe the environment situation the changes in time temporal and position spatial dimensions urges that the measurement methods need to be sufficiently efficient to be capable of representing the environmental status at any desired time thanks to recent progress in electronics

primary sensing and measurement equipment for engineers and scientists to measure the environmental phenomena accurately throughout the accessible universe dunbabin and marques 2012 luna 2011 numerous

sensors to survey the volcanic behaviours on the other hand meteorologists engaged autonomous aircraft to observe tornados debusk 2010 based on the literature wang 2015 aznar et al 2017 bayındır 2015 brambilla et al 2013 especially when the activity domain is large it is more efficient to use series of robots with simpler individual architecture instead of a single complicated unit with advanced equipment and sensors these methods are often known as multi agent systems mas or multi robot systems mrs oh and ahn 2012 cao et al 2013 a single robot solution might be sufficient for some environmental monitoring problems however when the search and monitoring domain is extended engaging multiple robots instead of one not only increases the robustness of the system by reducing the failure probability ren et al 2005 but also in spatiotemporal cases increases the accuracy of measurements by multisampling the environment concurrently thus multi robot systems mrs and multi agent systems mas have attracted the attention of many researchers due to their extensive applications a group of underwater joordens and jamshidi 2009 or surface wang et al 2012 search robots different types of unmanned flying drones aznar et al 2014 and ground vehicles barnes et al 2009 which interact with each other to achieve their goals are examples of the multi agent systems in these systems instead of one complicated solo system the desired objectives are shared with multiple more simple agents cao et al 2013 yet with more complicated control concerns conventionally the control of such systems was an expansion of single system control approaches notably one central unit monitors and governs the control command of the entire system these methods are called centralised control and due to their administrative control nature an end user or administrator could interfere and handle the system in emergency conditions however scalability is a concern in these methods and leads to severe bottlenecks such as bulk communication costs noisier networks and limited channels consequently distributed control theories emerged to handle scalability flexibility and robustness of the systems bayındır 2015 in distributed control methods every individual in the group is responsible for its own decision making and control system independent from a central unit by interacting with the environment and information flow among the local neighbours therefore these techniques are known as decentralised control on the other hand using multiple robots increases the complexity of the system tolmidis and petrou 2013 since collective informative planning is required however the majority of researches in multi agent and multi robot systems are focused mainly in the formation of robots in the flock such as bayındır 2015 cao et al 2013 oh et al 2015 which is substantially harmonised distances among the individuals in the group olfati saber et al 2007 during these methods the primary goal is to achieve the core formation control objectives which principally are adjacent maintenance collision avoidance and convergence to the anticipated destinations regularly the formation concept is considered as fixed and desired distances between the agents kawakami and namerikawa 2009 or temporarily flexible in order to avoid the obstacles rezaee and abdollahi 2014 seng et al 2014 the introductory descriptions of the suggested algorithm have been presented in pashna et al 2014 and pashna et al yazdani with fewer explanations and details therefore the existing approaches have some limitation when immense flexibility is required as an example when the aim is monitoring a particular phenomenon in the domain with unpredictable behaviours such as oil spills on the water surface in this paper we propose an adaptive and flexible formation approach which is interactive and capable of measuring and tracking specific environmental changes in the arena continuously to create a nowcast and ultimately a forecast using the history of measured data the followings are the main contributions of this paper we propose a framework to monitor the environment in order to visualise the spatiotemporal distribution of environmental changes e g pollution concentration using a series of measurements with not only one robot like ma et al 2017b but multiple of robots which increase the efficiency therefore the second contribution of this paper is offering multi robot informative planning singh et al 2007 approach to maximise the efficiency of the sampling finally the various simulation scenarios validated the proposed methodology in terms of robustness in the failure of robots or changes in mobile robot number in this paper since the monitoring of the oil spill expansion on the water surface is a spatiotemporal problem we address a supple formation protocol for a multi robot system which is flexible during the agents tasks indeed the form of the entire system depends on environmental and inter agent interactions meanwhile this algorithm suits for numerous applications of engaging multiple robots to track and monitor spatiotemporal environmental phenomena in different scales such as algae radioactive wastes or oil spill on the sea surface as an example without the loss of generality in this paper we simulate and track the boundaries of releasing oil on the water surface as one of the most variable and challenging catastrophes that should be concerned seriously to achieve more robustness and flexibility we combined the fuzzy control and virtual structure methods the fuzzy control method is analogous to the human brain decision making method and is fast and reliable for diverse kind of environmental changes mamdani 1981 in addition the applied virtual structure in this paper improves the scalability robustness and maximum expansion of the system for better environmental sampling the rest of this paper is structured as follows some brief preliminaries of this research including essential assumptions and introductory of oil spill release physics are addressed in the next section in the following section we explained the proposed approach thoroughly furthermore the results of the simulation are demonstrated in section 4 finally conclusions are stated in the last section 2 preliminaries in the proposed approach we focus on the strategy of distributing and forming the flock of robots in the following subsections the fundamental assumptions are discussed and a mathematical model of the oil diffusion and distribution on the water surface is described that is essential for the oil discharge and robots behaviour simulation 2 1 assumptions there are a few assumptions to be considered before discussing the methodology first we assumed that robots could thoroughly navigate themselves on the water surface the second assumption is that every robot can locate itself using positioning facilities such as global positioning system gps or global navigation satellite system glonass modules hofmann wellenhof et al 2007 meanwhile they should be capable of communicating through the network yang et al 2010 so that they can share their position in a regular schedule finally robots continue to re adjust their positions following the changes until they satisfy a certain level of precision and accuracy which is quantified in section 5 4 these are all fundamental facilities for any surface vehicle and not prohibitively especial and expensive having these they potentially can calculate their iterative destinations using the proposed algorithm and the available information 2 2 oil spill diffusion model in this paper the numerical model of the oil spill is used to simulate and evaluate the performance of the proposed method many researchers comprehensively presented numerical models of the discharging oil on the water surface these models are widely discussed in guo and wang 2009 de dominicis et al 2013 reedet al 1999 the most commonly used model is known as advection diffusion equation eq 1 representing the spatiotemporal distribution of oil on the water surface according to the fick s diffusion law fick 1995 the discharging oil concentration c disperse over the time as described in equation 1 with diffusion coefficients parameters d x d y and environmental flow like water currents u x u y 1 c t d x 2 c x 2 d y 2 c y 2 u x c x u y c y considering the instantaneous volume v t of oil release equation 2 derives dispersion of the oil as a function of time and location nepf 2 c x y t v t 4 π d x d y e x u x t 2 4 d x t y u y t 2 4 d y t however if the release rate of the oil is known as ω t over the time equation 3 would be derived from superposition principle and refers to the allotment of the oil on the sea surface represented by c x y t 3 c x y t t ω τ c x y t d τ on the other hand fay suggested fay 1971 estimation of the area a which is polluted by slicking oil as a function of the whole volume of the discharged mass v rooted in his several experimental observations 4 a η v 3 4 while in the metric system a is in the square meters and v is scaled in cubic meters then η is recommended to be 105 fay 1971 finally u x y is the external and environmental flow like currents that influence the oil spill advection and diffusion where x and y are longitude and latitude coordination 2 3 problem statement consider an area of the sea surface which is polluted by spilt oil c x y t is representing the spatiotemporal variable concentration of the pollution on the surface thoroughly discussed in section 3 3 and obtained from eq 1 c t h r is the threshold amount of the concentration so that the area of c x y t c t h r is equal to a calculated according to equation 2 c a indicates this variable region which is a target for our agents to surround and follow the changes on the other hand consider n robotic agents in a wireless network a i i 1 2 n positioned p i x i y i t on the water surface the centre of the flock position p c x i y i t is the average of agents locations on the surface and is calculated as 5 x c 1 n i 1 n x i y c 1 n i 1 n y i this centre point is considered as the origin of the polar coordinate system that we use for our further calculations therefore the polar coordination of the individuals reference to p c is 6 ρ i x i x c 2 y i y c 2 θ i a r c t a n y i y c x i y c fig 2 illustrates an example of a three robot system p i p j and p k where p c is the centre of the group meanwhile r c is the covered region surrounded by the hamiltonian circuit of agents around their centre p c in addition the distance between agents a i and a j is d i j and in the polar system is calculated as follows 7 d i j 2 ρ i 2 ρ j 2 2 ρ i ρ j cos θ j θ i meanwhile based on the second law of newton the dynamic of the system gurenko et al 2016 is as follows 8 p v v 1 m f while v denotes the velocity of the individuals m represents the robot s mass and f is the control input which consists of two elements 9 f f ϕ f f f ϕ is a rotational component of the control input managed by apf unit section 4 3 and f f is its radial component in a polar system that is controlled by the designed fuzzy controller section 4 2 the aim is to achieve a form of agents configuration so that the robots encircle the spill and follow the morphological changes in spill shape this allows us to consistently monitor the pollution situation and following consequences at the same time more uniform distribution of the agents in the area leads to better sampling form the environment therefore there are two primary objectives for this problem expression 10 and 11 the first objective is to maximise the precision of coverage of the agents and spilt area 10 max r c c a r c c a meanwhile the second objective is to maximise the total distance between the robots in order to achieve more expanded distribution however to avoid inconsequential expansion of robots formation the effectiveness of the second objective is only limited in the rotational velocity of the robots in polar coordinate system which is explained further in section 3 3 this objective not only avoids the collision of robots but also motivates robots to cover more areas in the searching domain 11 max i j d i j i j 1 2 n i j 3 3 our proposed approach 3 1 3 1 approach overview fig 1 shows the big picture of robots interaction with the environment and themselves the robots in the flock are aimed to iteratively adjust their position based on environmental changes and the other robots positions in the network fig 1a the process leads to computing the next destination of an individual robot and moving to this particular point the formation of the flock depends on time variable morphological distribution of the pollution fig 1b therefore a fuzzy controller is used to handle the radial component of control input f f based on fuzzified amount of pollution measured by the robots sensor on the other hand the apf unit manages the uniformity of the agents distribution on the network perimeter fig 3 illustrates the overview of the process in an individual agent which is equipped with a couple of sensors and a channel to communicate with other robots robot obtains the location information from the positioning sensor a and share it through the network with other robots as well as receiving other robots location from the network b then the received information is passed c and d to the apf modules to calculate the rotational component of control input e f ϕ at the same time the pollution sensor measures the pollution oil concentration and record it in the memory recorded pollution information from the sensor and memory feed the fuzzy controller to generate radial component f f of control input based on the controller s rule table stated in table 1 finally the resultant of both control modules are combined and drive robot s motors or thrusters to move it to the desired destination this algorithmic loop keeps cycling so that the entire flock react continuously to the pollution changes 3 2 3 2 fuzzy controller the fuzzy distribution of pollutants in the environment is the primary motivation to engage a fuzzy controller in this approach the other significant advantage of the fuzzy control systems is providing a simple look up table for robots leading to faster and more robust processing soo yeong and myung jin 1998 for this particular oil spill tracking application due to simplicity we considered two inputs of instant measurement of the oil from the sensor and previously recorded sample from memory thus the amount of pollutant concentration and robot speed are fuzzified through fuzzy membership functions as a result the fuzzy system controls the amplitude of the robot s speed in the radial aspect indeed the two inputs of this fuzzy system are the measuring amount of the pollutant at the instant time and at the previous time step which is recorded in memory moreover since the nature of oil distribution on water surface is exponential see equation 2 therefore natural logarithm of the measured concentration is used prior the inputs of the fuzzy controller all in all a mamdani fuzzy system mamdani 1981 is defined with two inputs of instantaneous and previous measured concentration from the sensor and memory respectively moreover three membership functions of the concentration are defined regarding fay 1971 and are partitioning the arena fuzzily as diluted boundaries and concentrated the output of the fuzzy system determines the robot speed motor which is defuzzified with centroid method whether in positive far from group centre or negative close to the centre amplitude in the range of negative maximum speeds of motors to positive divided by square root of two there are five membership functions named fastfar medfar slow medclose and fastclose assigned for motor speed output table 1 lists the rule table of this fuzzy system and fig 4 demonstrates the functionality of the fuzzy system based on normalized amount of pollution measurements 3 3 artificial potential filed it is desired to arrange the individuals of the flock in uniform distribution in this order we modelled all agents like identical electrical charge with similar polarity as a result they repulse each other but limited only in the rotational aspect around the flock centre note that the distance of each agent from flock centre is only controlled with the fuzzy controller thus there is only one degree of freedom for repulsive force effects equilibrium of these forces on each agent determines the f ϕ component of equation 9 an example of repulsive forces on i t h agent in a three agent system is demonstrated in fig 2 according to coulomb s law where q i and q j are representing charges of particles i and j and k 9 e 9 n m 2 c 2 the repulsive force from them is 12 f ϕ j i k q i q j d i j 2 and the perpendicular component of the force is 13 f ϕ j i f ϕ j i sin α j i then from the sine property of triangle p i p j p c we would have 14 d j i sin α j i ρ j sin θ j θ i therefore the perpendicular rotational component of the equilibrium is 15 f ϕ i k q i j q j d i j 2 sin α j i j 1 2 n i 16 f ϕ i k j ρ j d i j 3 sin θ j θ i j 1 2 n i where k is a constant positive gain one advantage of the proposed method is that every agent finds its appropriate position and equilibrium automatically then the system is robust against the unexpected changes in the number of agents during their mission fig 5 shows an example of eight robot system with random initial positions and fixed radius which adjust their rotational position to reach equilibrium according to equation 16 4 results and discussion the simulation aims to evaluate the robots performance fitting their formation to the variable shape of slicking oil based on the proposed method ocean currents data is obtained from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration s online database atlantic oceanographic and meteorological laboratory aoml noaa coast watch 2018 and is related to twenty days from 17 june to 6 july 2015 in addition the model of release is simulated based on fick s diffusion equation which is described in section 3 3 fig 6 illustrates the map of real data at pacific ocean east japan coast and the greyscale bar at the side indicates the velocity range between 0 and almost 2 5 m s for all diagrams of figs 6 9 horizontal and vertical x y directions refer to position aspects in the longitude and latitude directions respectively the time series snapshots of pursuing the simulated oil spill are illustrated in figs 7 9 a d fig 7 a shows the discharging position of slicking oil plus the initial positions of the flock circles the solid contours represent oil spill spread the dashed curve which is connecting the robots represents the profile of robots formation and is aimed to fit the oil spill boundaries this achieved from the rotational interpolation of robots positions around the flock centre among several simulations we observed the cubic spline interpolation demonstrated the best results pashna et al 2014 4 1 release tracking scenario in the first scenario the spatiotemporal oil release over all the time iterations is simulated after five time iterations the contraction of the flock is shown in fig 7 b notice all the robots are initially in dilute concentration condition therefore they shrink toward the flock centre in the early iterations it can be seen while the spill is growing the particles are relocating so the flock keeps tracking the oil boundaries the sequence of tracking is continued and shown in fig 7 c d for iterations 15 and 20 respectively the dashed line is obtained from the interpolation of robots positions around the group centre point 4 2 robots failure scenario in the next scenario we modelled a failure so that a couple of random agents failed and removed from the whole process fig 8 a d shows the sequence snapshots of this scenario we stopped the mobility and communication ability of two random agents in the fifth time iteration through the tracking process after the agents are missed the other robots adjust their rotational position to recover the absence of missing agents 4 3 new robots enter to the network in contrast with the previous scenario we added a couple of agents to the flock at time iteration five fig 9 a d shows this scenario s simulation snapshots this time the other robots compact their rotational positions automatically to open some positions for the newcomer robots these two new scenarios demonstrate the robustness of the algorithm against the changes in the number of agents which indicates the scalability of the system 4 4 evaluation in this section we define some evaluation terms to survey the performance of the flock since robots interact with the pollution spread we considered the numerical model of the pollution release described in section 3 3 as a reference to evaluate the precision and accuracy of the flock coverage therefore we define the term true positive tp as the area which both numerical method and robots coverage indicate as polluted area in contrast the region that is not determined by the numerical model of the oil spill neither the robots defined as true negative tn furthermore part of the area is polluted based on the numerical model but robots did not cover is considered as false negative fn finally the partition that flock indicates as polluted but is not polluted based on the numerical model is false positive fp consequently based on these terms and according to powers 2011 we could define two terms of accuracy and precision accuracy indicates the ratio of correct distinguished area of the environment with the group of robots both positive and negative but precision indicates the trueness of selected area by robots in the whole selected area the mathematical model of accuracy and precision described as follow 17 a c c u r a c y t p t n t p t n f p f n 18 p r e c i s i o n t p t p f p subsequently figs 10 and 11 show the accuracy and precision of the above three scenarios please note the decreasing trend of accuracy in fig 9 is because of the term tn significant dominance rather than tp initially the area of true negative region is noticeably larger than tp and while the spill is growing tn is getting smaller in the fixed simulation area therefore it causes a dropping trend of accuracy term this trend disappears in precision term see fig 11 which is independent of tn meanwhile it can be seen that after fifth time iteration which the number of the agents changed in latter scenarios a slight drop of accuracy and precision appears temporarily however it is compensated soon by replacement of the other agents and the flock recovers its tracking mission s accuracy and precision 4 5 scalability test in this section the scalability of the approach is experienced to do so the simulation is repeated against the number of employed robots the number of agents started in this experience varies from four agents in a simulation up until 100 of members as a result the range of coverage accuracy and precision are box plotted in figs 12 and 13 every simulation lasts for twenty time iterations and a variety of accuracy and precision are calculated as explained in the previous section the results show no meaningful and significant relationship between the number of engaged robots in simulation and the coverage precision and accuracy this means that system performance is stable and independent of the number of agents consequently this confirms and verifies the robustness of the system regarding scalability 5 conclusion in this paper we proposed a flexible formation control protocol rather than conventional fixed and predefined distances between individuals of a multi agent system this protocol relies on environmental changes and it is more appropriate for monitoring and tracking spatiotemporal environmental phenomena the approach is a novel combination of fuzzy controller and new defined virtual structure method to increase the robustness as demonstrated while the fuzzy controller covers a wide range of environmental possibility the proposed virtual structure keeps the flock in form the virtual structure that has been used in this research is a model of artificial repulsive force and manages the different individuals in maximum distance from each other finally we simulated the spatiotemporal release of oil spill on water surface and engaged a group of robots to track its boundaries in order to evaluate the flock performance we considered accuracy and precision as evaluation terms and analysed the proposed algorithm in diverse simulation scenarios simulations results demonstrated the appropriateness of the algorithm and confirmed its robustness versus changes in number of robots credit authorship contribution

section 3 3 and obtained from eq 1 c t h r is the threshold amount of the concentration so that the area of c x y t c t h r is equal to a calculated according to equation 2 c a indicates this variable region which is a target for our agents to surround and follow the changes on the other hand consider n robotic agents in a wireless network a i i 1 2 n positioned p i x i y i t on the water surface the centre of the flock position p c x i y i t is the average of agents locations on the surface and is calculated as 5 x c 1 n i 1 n x i y c 1 n i 1 n y i this centre point is considered as the origin of the polar coordinate system that we use for our further calculations therefore the polar coordination of the individuals reference to p c is 6 ρ i x i x c 2 y i y c 2 θ i a r c t a n y i y c x i y c fig 2 illustrates an example of a three robot system p i p j and p k where p c is the centre of the group meanwhile r c is the covered region surrounded by the hamiltonian circuit of agents around their centre p c in addition the distance between agents a i and a j is d i j and in the polar system is calculated as follows 7 d i j 2 ρ i 2 ρ j 2 2 ρ i ρ j cos θ j θ i meanwhile based on the second law of newton the dynamic of the system gurenko et al 2016 is as follows 8 p v v 1 m f while v denotes the velocity of the individuals m represents the robot s mass and f is the control input which consists of two elements 9 f f ϕ f f f ϕ is a rotational component of the control input managed by apf unit section 4 3 and f f is its radial component in a polar system that is controlled by the designed fuzzy controller section 4 2 the aim is to achieve a form of agents configuration so that the robots encircle the spill and follow the morphological changes in spill shape this allows us to consistently monitor the pollution situation and following consequences at the same time more uniform distribution of the agents in the area leads to better sampling form the environment therefore there are two primary objectives for this problem expression 10 and 11 the first objective is to maximise the precision of coverage of the agents and spilt area 10 max r c c a r c c a meanwhile the second objective is to maximise the total distance between the robots in order to achieve more expanded distribution however to avoid inconsequential expansion of robots formation the effectiveness of the second objective is only limited in the rotational velocity of the robots in polar coordinate system which is explained further in section 3 3 this objective not only avoids the collision of robots but also motivates robots to cover more areas in the searching domain 11 max i j d i j i j 1 2 n i j 3 3 our proposed approach 3 1 3 1 approach overview fig 1 shows the big picture of robots interaction with the environment and themselves the robots in the flock are aimed to iteratively adjust their position based on environmental changes and the other robots positions in the network fig 1a the process leads to computing the next destination of an individual robot and moving to this particular point the formation of the flock depends on time variable morphological distribution of the pollution fig 1b therefore a fuzzy controller is used to handle the radial component of control input f f based on fuzzified amount of pollution measured by the robots sensor on the other hand the apf unit manages the uniformity of the agents distribution on the network perimeter fig 3 illustrates the overview of the process in an individual agent which is equipped with a couple of sensors and a channel to communicate with other robots robot obtains the location information from the positioning sensor a and share it through the network with other robots as well as receiving other robots location from the network b then the received information is passed c and d to the apf modules to calculate the rotational component of control input e f ϕ at the same time the pollution sensor measures the pollution oil concentration and record it in the memory recorded pollution information from the sensor and memory feed the fuzzy controller to generate radial component f f of control input based on the controller s rule table stated in table 1 finally the resultant of both control modules are combined and drive robot s motors or thrusters to move it to the desired destination this algorithmic loop keeps cycling so that the entire flock react continuously to the pollution changes 3 2 3 2 fuzzy controller the fuzzy distribution of pollutants in the environment is the primary motivation to engage a fuzzy controller in this approach the other significant advantage of the fuzzy control systems is providing a simple look up table for robots leading to faster and more robust processing soo yeong and myung jin 1998 for this particular oil spill tracking application due to simplicity we considered two inputs of instant measurement of the oil from the sensor and previously recorded sample from memory thus the amount of pollutant concentration and robot speed are fuzzified through fuzzy membership functions as a result the fuzzy system controls the amplitude of the robot s speed in the radial aspect indeed the two inputs of this fuzzy system are the measuring amount of the pollutant at the instant time and at the previous time step which is recorded in memory moreover since the nature of oil distribution on water surface is exponential see equation 2 therefore natural logarithm of the measured concentration is used prior the inputs of the fuzzy controller all in all a mamdani fuzzy system mamdani 1981 is defined with two inputs of instantaneous and previous measured concentration from the sensor and memory respectively moreover three membership functions of the concentration are defined regarding fay 1971 and are partitioning the arena fuzzily as diluted boundaries and concentrated the output of the fuzzy system determines the robot speed motor which is defuzzified with centroid method whether in positive far from group centre or negative close to the centre amplitude in the range of negative maximum speeds of motors to positive divided by square root of two there are five membership functions named fastfar medfar slow medclose and fastclose assigned for motor speed output table 1 lists the rule table of this fuzzy system and fig 4 demonstrates the functionality of the fuzzy system based on normalized amount of pollution measurements 3 3 artificial potential filed it is desired to arrange the individuals of the flock in uniform distribution in this order we modelled all agents like identical electrical charge with similar polarity as a result they repulse each other but limited only in the rotational aspect around the flock centre note that the distance of each agent from flock centre is only controlled with the fuzzy controller thus there is only one degree of freedom for repulsive force effects equilibrium of these forces on each agent determines the f ϕ component of equation 9 an example of repulsive forces on i t h agent in a three agent system is demonstrated in fig 2 according to coulomb s law where q i and q j are representing charges of particles i and j and k 9 e 9 n m 2 c 2 the repulsive force from them is 12 f ϕ j i k q i q j d i j 2 and the perpendicular component of the force is 13 f ϕ j i f ϕ j i sin α j i then from the sine property of triangle p i p j p c we would have 14 d j i sin α j i ρ j sin θ j θ i therefore the perpendicular rotational component of the equilibrium is 15 f ϕ i k q i j q j d i j 2 sin α j i j 1 2 n i 16 f ϕ i k j ρ j d i j 3 sin θ j θ i j 1 2 n i where k is a constant positive gain one advantage of the proposed method is that every agent finds its appropriate position and equilibrium automatically then the system is robust against the unexpected changes in the number of agents during their mission fig 5 shows an example of eight robot system with random initial positions and fixed radius which adjust their rotational position to reach equilibrium according to equation 16 4 results and discussion the simulation aims to evaluate the robots performance fitting their formation to the variable shape of slicking oil based on the proposed method ocean currents data is obtained from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration s online database atlantic oceanographic and meteorological laboratory aoml noaa coast watch 2018 and is related to twenty days from 17 june to 6 july 2015 in addition the model of release is simulated based on fick s diffusion equation which is described in section 3 3 fig 6 illustrates the map of real data at pacific ocean east japan coast and the greyscale bar at the side indicates the velocity range between 0 and almost 2 5 m s for all diagrams of figs 6 9 horizontal and vertical x y directions refer to position aspects in the longitude and latitude directions respectively the time series snapshots of pursuing the simulated oil spill are illustrated in figs 7 9 a d fig 7 a shows the discharging position of slicking oil plus the initial positions of the flock circles the solid contours represent oil spill spread the dashed curve which is connecting the robots represents the profile of robots formation and is aimed to fit the oil spill boundaries this achieved from the rotational interpolation of robots positions around the flock centre among several simulations we observed the cubic spline interpolation demonstrated the best results pashna et al 2014 4 1 release tracking scenario in the first scenario the spatiotemporal oil release over all the time iterations is simulated after five time iterations the contraction of the flock is shown in fig 7 b notice all the robots are initially in dilute concentration condition therefore they shrink toward the flock centre in the early iterations it can be seen while the spill is growing the particles are relocating so the flock keeps tracking the oil boundaries the sequence of tracking is continued and shown in fig 7 c d for iterations 15 and 20 respectively the dashed line is obtained from the interpolation of robots positions around the group centre point 4 2 robots failure scenario in the next scenario we modelled a failure so that a couple of random agents failed and removed from the whole process fig 8 a d shows the sequence snapshots of this scenario we stopped the mobility and communication ability of two random agents in the fifth time iteration through the tracking process after the agents are missed the other robots adjust their rotational position to recover the absence of missing agents 4 3 new robots enter to the network in contrast with the previous scenario we added a couple of agents to the flock at time iteration five fig 9 a d shows this scenario s simulation snapshots this time the other robots compact their rotational positions automatically to open some positions for the newcomer robots these two new scenarios demonstrate the robustness of the algorithm against the changes in the number of agents which indicates the scalability of the system 4 4 evaluation in this section we define some evaluation terms to survey the performance of the flock since robots interact with the pollution spread we considered the numerical model of the pollution release described in section 3 3 as a reference to evaluate the precision and accuracy of the flock coverage therefore we define the term true positive tp as the area which both numerical method and robots coverage indicate as polluted area in contrast the region that is not determined by the numerical model of the oil spill neither the robots defined as true negative tn furthermore part of the area is polluted based on the numerical model but robots did not cover is considered as false negative fn finally the partition that flock indicates as polluted but is not polluted based on the numerical model is false positive fp consequently based on these terms and according to powers 2011 we could define two terms of accuracy and precision accuracy indicates the ratio of correct distinguished area of the environment with the group of robots both positive and negative but precision indicates the trueness of selected area by robots in the whole selected area the mathematical model of accuracy and precision described as follow 17 a c c u r a c y t p t n t p t n f p f n 18 p r e c i s i o n t p t p f p subsequently figs 10 and 11 show the accuracy and precision of the above three scenarios please note the decreasing trend of accuracy in fig 9 is because of the term tn significant dominance rather than tp initially the area of true negative region is noticeably larger than tp and while the spill is growing tn is getting smaller in the fixed simulation area therefore it causes a dropping trend of accuracy term this trend disappears in precision term see fig 11 which is independent of tn meanwhile it can be seen that after fifth time iteration which the number of the agents changed in latter scenarios a slight drop of accuracy and precision appears temporarily however it is compensated soon by replacement of the other agents and the flock recovers its tracking mission s accuracy and precision 4 5 scalability test in this section the scalability of the approach is experienced to do so the simulation is repeated against the number of employed robots the number of agents started in this experience varies from four agents in a simulation up until 100 of members as a result the range of coverage accuracy and precision are box plotted in figs 12 and 13 every simulation lasts for twenty time iterations and a variety of accuracy and precision are calculated as explained in the previous section the results show no meaningful and significant relationship between the number of engaged robots in simulation and the coverage precision and accuracy this means that system performance is stable and independent of the number of agents consequently this confirms and verifies the robustness of the system regarding scalability 5 conclusion in this paper we proposed a flexible formation control protocol rather than conventional fixed and predefined distances between individuals of a multi agent system this protocol relies on environmental changes and it is more appropriate for monitoring and tracking spatiotemporal environmental phenomena the approach is a novel combination of fuzzy controller and new defined virtual structure method to increase the robustness as demonstrated while the fuzzy controller covers a wide range of environmental possibility the proposed virtual structure keeps the flock in form the virtual structure that has been used in this research is a model of artificial repulsive force and manages the different individuals in maximum distance from each other finally we simulated the spatiotemporal release of oil spill on water surface and engaged a group of robots to track its boundaries in order to evaluate the flock performance we considered accuracy and precision as evaluation terms and analysed the proposed algorithm in diverse simulation scenarios simulations results demonstrated the appropriateness of the algorithm and confirmed its robustness versus changes in number of robots credit authorship contribution

21851,underwater natural gas pipelines ungps used to typically transport natural gas which is a very important energy resource can be punctured due to various reasons such as corrosion and shipping fishing activities therefore the detection and positioning of leakages has an important role in ensuring energy reliability and preventing environmental pollution in this study kth nearest neighbor knn algorithm based fingerprint method is proposed to locate leakages in the ungps the success of this method is analyzed using a realistic time varying multipath underwater acoustic channel and the parameters of a real life ungp numerical results show that for this channel leakages can be positioned with a margin of low errors from kilometers away depending on the ambient noise number of receivers and sea wave height keywords underwater natural gas pipeline passive acoustic localization received signal strength fingerprint method kth nearest neighbor algorithm 1 introduction natural gas is usually transported through pipelines from where it is produced to where it is consumed and a significant portion of these pipelines pass underwater underwater natural gas pipelines ungps can be punctured for many reasons mainly internal and external corrosion due to aging and fishing activities ship anchors trawl nets etc united nations 2007 therefore continuous monitoring of the ungps the early detection of the leakages and the early intervention plays an important role in preventing wasting of this energy resource and environmental pollution protecting the natural life in the literature there are various methods for detecting and or positioning leakages in ungps barbagelata and barbagelata 2004 det norske veritas 2010 thodi et al 2012 zhang 1996 murvay and silea 2012 mahmutoglu and turk 2017 2018a b these methods can be divided into two as internal and external internal based methods are composed of flow pressure change mass volume balance pressure point analysis negative pressure wave methods statistical method and real time transient modeling method dynamic model based method zhang 1996 murvay and silea 2012 flow pressure change and mass volume balance methods have common drawbacks which are high cost failure in positioning of leakage and low sensitivity for small leakages negative pressure wave method is useless for long pipelines pressure point analysis method can only detect but not pinpoint leakage statistical and real time transient modeling methods are high cost methods external based methods are comprised of capacitance semi conductor optical camera bio sensor fiber optic cable fluorescence and acoustics methods barbagelata and barbagelata 2004 det norske veritas 2010 thodi et al 2012 capacitance semi conductor and bio sensor methods can only detect but not locate leakage optical camera and fluorescent methods have a limited detection range 3 5 m and they highly depend on turbidity of water fiber optic cable method as fiber bragg grating fbg hoop strain sensors with machine learning based techniques was used to locate leakages on terrestrial gas pipelines jia et al 2019b a the proposed methods given in jia et al 2019b a have low margin of errors however these methods are not suitable to locate leakages in ungps because these methods have several disadvantages which includes the deterioration of the chemical coating of the fiber cable over time the difficulty of adaptation to existing ungps the difficulty of fiber medium coupling in turbidity and high pressure underwater environments and the lack of long term reliability testing det norske veritas 2010 murvay and silea 2012 miah and potter 2017 in conclusion except passive acoustic method pam all abovementioned methods have many drawbacks to locate leakages in ungps several passive acoustic based methods using the received signal strength rss for localization of leakages in ungps have been proposed in mahmutoglu and turk 2017 2018a b however the underwater acoustic channel was considered as additive white gaussian noise awgn in mahmutoglu and turk 2017 2018a in mahmutoglu and turk 2018b sea surface and bottom reflectance effects are partially included in the noisy channel model the channel model used in mahmutoglu and turk 2018b has a constant geometry and has neglected the change of sea surface over time in fact due to the mobility of the transmitter receiver and the sea surface the actual underwater acoustic channel has variable geometry scattering effect and the doppler shift but above mentioned studies ignored all these effects in this study the problem of locating leakages in ungps is scrutinized for an underwater acoustic channel model proposed in qarabaqi and stojanovic 2013a which is frequently used in the literature and is quite realistic in this model where many physical properties of acoustic propagation are taken into consideration the effect of sea surface variation over time is also regarded existingly with multipath fading effect the methods in mahmutoglu and turk 2017 2018a b for leakage positioning are insufficient multipath effect of the time varying channel should be coped with in locating leakage problem in the localization literature numerous methods have been proposed to overcome multipath effect of the channel bhuiyan and lohan 2010 tamazin et al 2016 marx et al 2009 aram et al 2007 ladha et al 2007 lazaro et al 2013 li jun et al 2012 koenig et al 2011 jaffe and wax 2014 dubrovinskaya et al 2017 lee et al 2009 in many techniques such as early minus late delay locked loop double delta technique multipath estimating delay locked loop medll non coherent medll early late slope and wavelet analysis which are used in localization systems to mitigate multipath channel effect a known training sequence is sent from transmitter to receiver to estimate frequency impulse response of the channel bhuiyan and lohan 2010 tamazin et al 2016 marx et al 2009 aram et al 2007 however since there is no possibility of sending the training sequence to the receivers from the leakage the relevant methods are not suitable for locating leakages in the ungps in ladha et al 2007 and lazaro et al 2013 frequency diversity method was used to mitigate multipath channel effect in rss based localization in the frequency diversity method the data to be transmitted is sent using more than one carrier frequency however as the frequency of the leakage based acoustic signal is constant and there is no possibility of changing as long as the diameter of the leak hole or the pipeline depth is unchanged the frequency diversity method is not suitable for locating leakages in ungps in li jun et al 2012 which is related to passive target positioning in the multipath underwater channel sea surface and bottom based multipath delays were obtained using cepstrum method and these multipath delays were used to locate the target cepstrum method provides a summative expression of the reflection components resulting from the multipath channel ungp is punctured slowly over time because of especially corrosion based effects that is why it may not be possible for the receiver to capture the initial portions transient part of the leakage signal in this case it is not possible to obtain multipath delay information from the received periodic sine signal by cepstrum method and so the leakage cannot be located apart from these methods the fingerprint technique used in signal strength based positioning is a highly effective and common multipath channel effect mitigation approach and is used for underwater target localization koenig et al 2011 jaffe and wax 2014 dubrovinskaya et al 2017 lee et al 2009 according to the best of authors knowledge the fingerprint technique has not yet been used for locating leakages in ungps in this study k t h nearest neighbor knn algorithm based fingerprint technique is used to pinpoint leakages in ungps the underwater acoustic channel model proposed in qarabaqi and stojanovic 2013a is used as the channel model the success of the knn algorithm based fingerprint technique is examined for three different scenarios which are various receiver numbers sea wave heights and ambient noises the rest of the paper is organized as follows in section 2 the time varying multipath underwater acoustic channel which is used in this study is outlined in section 3 the localization system and method is described numerical results are given in section 4 and conclusions are summarized in section 5 2 underwater acoustic channel in the literature there is no consensus on which underwater acoustic channel model should be used because the underwater environment varies from region to region some channel models used in the literature are given as follows bellhop which is a beam tracing tool based on the ray theory models the underwater acoustic channel but ignores the random variations of the channel porter and bucker 1987 in heitsenrether and badiey 2004 the surface motion effect which is one of the effects of random variation of the underwater acoustic channel was adapted to the bellhop model however in heitsenrether and badiey 2004 the simulation results obtained for the proposed channel model at high wind speeds did not overlap with the measurement results virtual time series experiment virtex which is also a beam tracing tool models the channel statistically and has less computational complexity than bellhop peterson and porter 2013 on the other hand it may not be said that the computational complexity of virtex is sufficiently low numerous studies have been conducted to model the underwater acoustic channel stochastically qarabaqi and stojanovic 2009 radosevic et al 2009 socheleau et al 2009 galvin and coats 1996 qarabaqi and stojanovic 2011 tomasi et al 2010 yang and yang 2006 zhang et al 2010 in these studies channel models were created by analyzing acoustic data measurements taken from certain regions in some of these studies rician or rayleigh distribution was consistent with the measurements taken while in some the log normal distribution and the k distribution matched in other words since the characteristics of the seas are different from each other channel models which are compatible with different statistical distributions were proposed in the related studies therefore in these studies the proposed channel models for specific environments may not be applicable in different environments in comparison with the other channel models in the literature which are mentioned above the underwater acoustic channel is modeled in the most realistic way in qarabaqi and stojanovic 2013a the authors conducted a comprehensive mathematical analysis to describe the time varying underwater channel in this description most of the physical properties of acoustic propagation such as seabed and surface reflections random displacements and the resulting doppler effect frequency dependent attenuation were taken into account in qarabaqi and stojanovic 2013a underwater channel variations were classified as small scale variations and large scale variations depending on the size of random displacements of transmitter receivers due to sea flows sea surface mobility drifting etc small scale variations which are used to define scattering and motion based doppler effects are responsible for rapid changes in the instantaneous channel response large scale variations which influence the average of received signal strength are used to define position uncertainty due to changing system geometry and variable environmental conditions that is to say large scale variations are modeled as a result of random systemic displacements that lead to large changes in the gain and delay of propagation paths to sum up in a channel with constant geometry nominal channel the signals sent from the transmitter reach the receivers through paths with different directions of arrival and lengths large scale variations cause each propagation path to change randomly from the nominal value while small scale variations cause each propagation path to be scattered and subdivided into a number of intra paths the block diagram of this underwater acoustic channel which is often used in the literature kari et al 2017 pedrosa et al 2014 zhao et al 2017 is shown in fig 1 and transfer function of the channel is given in 1 1 h f h 0 f p h p γ p f e j 2 π f τ p here h 0 f p h p γ p f and τ p are the reference path transfer function number of paths path gain small scale fading coefficient and path delay respectively detailed information and equations about the variables are given in qarabaqi and stojanovic 2013a the analytical channel model proposed in qarabaqi and stojanovic 2013a was confirmed by experimental studies and the underwater acoustic channel simulator in qarabaqi and stojanovic 2013b was developed by the authors of the relevant study in this simulator simplified ray tracing software in which the sound speed is constant and the sea surface bottom is considered as smooth or alternatively bellhop ray tracing software is presented for large scale simulations for small scale simulations direct model or alternatively statistical equivalent model is presented 3 leakage localization for ungps in this study it is assumed that the receivers are hanged at a depth close to the ungp from the various number of buoys which are equally spaced it is supposed that the acoustic pressure signals received by these receivers are sent to the land station and where the leakage is pinpointed using the knn algorithm based fingerprint technique because the depth of the ungp is known and its diameter is small enough to be neglected the three dimensional localization problem can be reduced to one dimensional problem only the length axis of the pipeline therefore one dimensional localization is performed in this study proposed method is composed of two parts detection and localization basically in the detection part bandpass filters are used to detect leakage based signal if there is leakage signal then fingerprint method based localization part is initiated to locate the leakage acoustic pressure signals on the receiver side are sinusoidal signals with a constant frequency depending on the underwater acoustic channel and the leak hole diameter therefore at the detection part similar to mahmutoglu and turk 2018a the entire spectrum where the leakage based acoustic pressure signal may be present is swept through the 3 hz narrow band bandpass filters on the receiving side thus the transmit power of the acoustic pressure signal at the leak hole can be calculated using the frequency of the determined signal the parameters given in the numerical results section the corresponding equations given in mahmutoglu and turk 2018a and 2 subsequently the ambient noise effect is reduced by averaging the powers of the filtered signals for a while these processes are applied to the received signals in both the training and localization phases of the fingerprint method described below 2 p i 1 b p 0 e π δ f 0 t τ i c o s 2 π f 0 t τ i ϑ here p p 0 δ f 0 ϑ b t and τ i are acoustic pressure signal of a continuous sequence of bubbles peak acoustic pressure dissipation constant oscillation frequency phase angle the number of oscillating bubbles the time and the time delay between 1 t h and i t h bubbles detailed explanations and equations related to the mentioned variables are given in mahmutoglu and turk 2018a it is not possible to locate the leak hole with low errors without decreasing the fading effect which is as a result of position uncertainties scattering and moving sea surface effects in the variable channel despite the fact that the signal transmit power at the leak hole and the power it reaches to the receivers are known in this study knn algorithm based fingerprint technique is proposed for localization leakage localization process with the knn algorithm based fingerprint technique is performed in two phases as shown in fig 2 in both phases the above mentioned filtering and noise reduction procedures are applied to the received signals 1 training phase in the first phase known as the training phase it is assumed that there is a leak hole in the ungp and that the leak hole position is changed at short intervals throughout ungp thus for each leak hole position changed the average of the power of received signal without noise which varies over time according to the channel model is recorded and then the data sets fingerprint map to be used in localization are created the localization system and the average powers of the signals collected by the receivers for various leak hole positions are shown in fig 2 here m and n are the receiver number and the number of samples in each set of data created during the training phase respectively for x l x l 1 x l 2 x l n leak hole positions average powers of signals which are received by 1 t h 2 n d m t h receivers are p 1 p 11 p 12 p 1 n p 2 p 21 p 22 p 2 n p m p m 1 p m 2 p m n respectively these data sets can be expressed with the matrix in 3 where t refers to transposition 3 p p 1 t p 2 t p m t p 11 p m 1 p 1 n p m n 2 localization phase in the localization phase the average powers of the signals collected by the receivers for a leak hole with unknown position are matched with the data sets recorded in the training phase using a matching algorithm and the leak hole is positioned in this study due to its simplicity and its effectiveness in pinpointing the knn algorithm is used as matching algorithm liang et al 2012 li et al 2012 in the knn algorithm the euclidean distances between the average signal power data sets recorded in the training phase and the average powers of the signals reaching the receivers from a leak hole with unknown position are calculated using 4 then the calculated euclidean distances are sorted and k neighbors with the lowest distances are selected the leak hole position is obtained by averaging the selected k neighbors positions liang et al 2012 in the knn algorithm k is an integer between 1 and sample number of one of the training data sets to obtain the best performance from the knn algorithm k may be selected as 3 or 4 li et al 2012 4 d i s t i z 1 m p z i p z 2 here p p 1 p 2 p m is a data set of average powers of the signals that reach the receivers from the leak hole with unknown position p and i are average signal power data sets recorded during the training phase and the element index value in these datasets respectively 4 numerical results in the simulation studies to assess the positioning performance of the knn algorithm based fingerprint technique 10 km of a real life ungp with a gas flow rate of 136 m 3 s at a depth of 400 m is used as an example kandiyoti 2009 acoustic pressure signal for a continuous sequence of bubbles is generated using the following parameters the equations detailed in mahmutoglu and turk 2018a and 2 values of g gravitational acceleration h depth ρ density of water κ specific heat ratio τ delay between successive bubbles d r e f reference distance d h o l e diameter of the leak hole s bubble surface tension and q gas flow rate are 9 8 m s 2 400 m 1000 kg m 3 1 49 19 75 ms 1 m 1 mm 0 07423 n m and 136 m 3 s respectively in this study underwater acoustic channel simulator developed in qarabaqi and stojanovic 2013b is used as mentioned before in this simulator simplified ray tracing software in which the sound speed is constant and the sea surface bottom is considered as smooth or alternatively bellhop ray tracing software is presented for large scale simulations for small scale simulations direct model or alternatively statistical equivalent model is presented in bellhop software ray tracing is performed for a specific sound speed profile variation of sound speed depending on the depth and a specific seabed structure however ray tracing for a specific area may not be accurate for a different area because the sound speed profile and the seabed structure show regional differences therefore in this study similar to pedrosa et al 2014 instead of bellhop which has a higher computational complexity simplified ray tracing is used for large scale simulations in order to be more general and direct model is used for small scale simulations values of the parameters used in the underwater acoustic channel simulator are given in tables 1 and 2 where sd and psd are stand for standard deviation and power spectral density respectively the cut factor is used to limit the number of rays received the power of the direct path signal is divided by the cut factor and the signals whose power is below this value are ignored small scale simulation parameters are assumed to be constant for all paths large scale variations are restricted with h h s u r f the channel model equations using these parameters are described extensively in qarabaqi and stojanovic 2013a the following assumptions are made in the simulations during the training phase of the fingerprint method the position of the leak hole is changed from 0 to 10 km at intervals of 16 m to create a fingerprint map in this process surface wave height a w is taken as 4 m in the localization phase the position of the leak hole is changed from 0 to 10 km at 10 m intervals for various wave heights positions of 3 4 5 and 6 receivers which are used in various receiver numbers scenario are taken as 3 5 7 km 2 4 6 8 km 1 3 5 7 9 km and 1 2 6 4 2 5 8 7 4 9 km respectively in all other cases 4 receivers are used in the knn algorithm k is taken as 3 the ambient noise at the receivers is given for 3 hz bandwidth the number of monte carlo mc trials is taken as 1000 the performance of the method is examined for various ambient noises wave heights and receiver numbers in this study five different ambient noises which are n 1 n 2 n 3 n 4 and n 5 including all noise components thermal turbulence shipping and wave mentioned in mahmutoglu and turk 2018a are considered for these ambient noises the beaufort scale which shows the relationship between the observed sea conditions and the wind speeds is assumed as 8 19 m s wind speed mahmutoglu and turk 2017 and the shipping activity factors are considered as 0 1 0 3 0 5 0 7 and 1 respectively powers of the n 1 n 2 n 3 n 4 and n 5 ambient noises are 80 75 83 87 87 46 91 3 and 97 2 db re 1 μ pa respectively the relationship between the leak hole position and the root mean squared position error rmspe for 3 m wave height and n 3 ambient noise is shown in fig 3 here there is a symmetry between rmspes in the range of 0 5 km and 5 10 km as expected the sudden decreases and increases in rmspe values in the figure are due to the fading effect of the channel in fig 4 the relationships between shipping activity factors and the average of the rmspes obtained for the leak hole positions which are changed at 10 m intervals between 0 10 km are shown for wave heights of 1 m 2 m 3 m 4 m and 5 m as can be seen in the figure the increased shipping activity factor ambient noise power decreases positioning accuracy the wave height affects the positioning error significantly the relationship between the receiver number and the average rmspe for 1 m wave height and n 5 ambient noise is shown in fig 5 the relationships between position error and probability density for various receiver numbers are shown in fig 6 as expected the accuracy of positioning increases as the number of receivers increases probabilities of positioning errors being less than 100 m 200 m 300 m 400 m and 500 m for various receiver numbers are given in table 3 where rn stands for receiver number the relationships between position error and probability density for 1 m 3 m 5 m wave heights and n 1 n 5 ambient noises are shown in fig 7 the figure shows that as the power of ambient noise increases the probability curve becomes shorter and wider probabilities of positioning errors being less than 100 m 200 m 300 m 400 m and 500 m for 1 m 3 m 5 m wave heights and n 1 n 5 ambient noises are given in table 4 to the best of our knowledge there is no comprehensive study to compare our results in the literature undoubtedly the most accurate results can be obtained from experimental studies however it would be very difficult and costly to establish an experimental system which is at a depth of 400 m and has a very high gas pressure and flow rate to compare our simulation results meanwhile the method proposed in this study which can be easily used for real life ungp leakage problems is highly efficient and cost effective in this study fingerprint maps were obtained for a specific ungp however for real life ungp leakage problems many fingerprint maps for different leak hole diameter pipeline depth seawater density seabed density surface wave height and surface wave frequency parameters can be obtained through simulation works using the highly realistic underwater acoustic channel simulator and eq 2 which is well accepted in the literature to produce the acoustic pressure leakage signal then for the real leakage environment underwater that changes momentarily the appropriate one of the pre calculated fingerprint maps is selected and positioning is performed 5 conclusions in this study the knn algorithm based fingerprint technique is proposed to locate leakages in ungps in order to examine the success of the method a real life ungp is considered numerical results showed that the leak hole in the 10 km long ungp for the quite realistic underwater acoustic channel model which varies over time can be positioned with errors of less than 200 m with the probabilities of 87 and 97 for 1 m wave height n 5 ambient noise and 5 m wave height n 1 ambient noise respectively for this reason leakages in ungps using the method can be located in short time with low errors thus interfering with ungp as soon as possible it should be noted that the localization accuracy is highly depended on the sample number taken in the training phase thus positioning accuracy can be increased by increasing the number of samples taken at the training phase undoubtfully most accurate results can be obtained from experimental studies but it is very costly and hard to

21851,underwater natural gas pipelines ungps used to typically transport natural gas which is a very important energy resource can be punctured due to various reasons such as corrosion and shipping fishing activities therefore the detection and positioning of leakages has an important role in ensuring energy reliability and preventing environmental pollution in this study kth nearest neighbor knn algorithm based fingerprint method is proposed to locate leakages in the ungps the success of this method is analyzed using a realistic time varying multipath underwater acoustic channel and the parameters of a real life ungp numerical results show that for this channel leakages can be positioned with a margin of low errors from kilometers away depending on the ambient noise number of receivers and sea wave height keywords underwater natural gas pipeline passive acoustic localization received signal strength fingerprint method kth nearest neighbor algorithm 1 introduction natural gas is usually transported through pipelines from where it is produced to where it is consumed and a significant portion of these pipelines pass underwater underwater natural gas pipelines ungps can be punctured for many reasons mainly internal and external corrosion due to aging and fishing activities ship anchors trawl nets etc united nations 2007 therefore continuous monitoring of the ungps the early detection of the leakages and the early intervention plays an important role in preventing wasting of this energy resource and environmental pollution protecting the natural life in the literature there are various methods for detecting and or positioning leakages in ungps barbagelata and barbagelata 2004 det norske veritas 2010 thodi et al 2012 zhang 1996 murvay and silea 2012 mahmutoglu and turk 2017 2018a b these methods can be divided into two as internal and external internal based methods are composed of flow pressure change mass volume balance pressure point analysis negative pressure wave methods statistical method and real time transient modeling method dynamic model based method zhang 1996 murvay and silea 2012 flow pressure change and mass volume balance methods have common drawbacks which are high cost failure in positioning of leakage and low sensitivity for small leakages negative pressure wave method is useless for long pipelines pressure point analysis method can only detect but not pinpoint leakage statistical and real time transient modeling methods are high cost methods external based methods are comprised of capacitance semi conductor optical camera bio sensor fiber optic cable fluorescence and acoustics methods barbagelata and barbagelata 2004 det norske veritas 2010 thodi et al 2012 capacitance semi conductor and bio sensor methods can only detect but not locate leakage optical camera and fluorescent methods have a limited detection range 3 5 m and they highly depend on turbidity of water fiber optic cable method as fiber bragg grating fbg hoop strain sensors with machine learning based techniques was used to locate leakages on terrestrial gas pipelines jia et al 2019b a the proposed methods given in jia et al 2019b a have low margin of errors however these methods are not suitable to locate leakages in ungps because these methods have several disadvantages which includes the deterioration of the chemical coating of the fiber cable over time the difficulty of adaptation to existing ungps the difficulty of fiber medium coupling in turbidity and high pressure underwater environments and the lack of long term reliability testing det norske veritas 2010 murvay and silea 2012 miah and potter 2017 in conclusion except passive acoustic method pam all abovementioned methods have many drawbacks to locate leakages in ungps several passive acoustic based methods using the received signal strength rss for localization of leakages in ungps have been proposed in mahmutoglu and turk 2017 2018a b however the underwater acoustic channel was considered as additive white gaussian noise awgn in mahmutoglu and turk 2017 2018a in mahmutoglu and turk 2018b sea surface and bottom reflectance effects are partially included in the noisy channel model the channel model used in mahmutoglu and turk 2018b has a constant geometry and has neglected the change of sea surface over time in fact due to the mobility of the transmitter receiver and the sea surface the actual underwater acoustic channel has variable geometry scattering effect and the doppler shift but above mentioned studies ignored all these effects in this study the problem of locating leakages in ungps is scrutinized for an underwater acoustic channel model proposed in qarabaqi and stojanovic 2013a which is frequently used in the literature and is quite realistic in this model where many physical properties of acoustic propagation are taken into consideration the effect of sea surface variation over time is also regarded existingly with multipath fading effect the methods in mahmutoglu and turk 2017 2018a b for leakage positioning are insufficient multipath effect of the time varying channel should be coped with in locating leakage problem in the localization literature numerous methods have been proposed to overcome multipath effect of the channel bhuiyan and lohan 2010 tamazin et al 2016 marx et al 2009 aram et al 2007 ladha et al 2007 lazaro et al 2013 li jun et al 2012 koenig et al 2011 jaffe and wax 2014 dubrovinskaya et al 2017 lee et al 2009 in many techniques such as early minus late delay locked loop double delta technique multipath estimating delay locked loop medll non coherent medll early late slope and wavelet analysis which are used in localization systems to mitigate multipath channel effect a known training sequence is sent from transmitter to receiver to estimate frequency impulse response of the channel bhuiyan and lohan 2010 tamazin et al 2016 marx et al 2009 aram et al 2007 however since there is no possibility of sending the training sequence to the receivers from the leakage the relevant methods are not suitable for locating leakages in the ungps in ladha et al 2007 and lazaro et al 2013 frequency diversity method was used to mitigate multipath channel effect in rss based localization in the frequency diversity method the data to be transmitted is sent using more than one carrier frequency however as the frequency of the leakage based acoustic signal is constant and there is no possibility of changing as long as the diameter of the leak hole or the pipeline depth is unchanged the frequency diversity method is not suitable for locating leakages in ungps in li jun et al 2012 which is related to passive target positioning in the multipath underwater channel sea surface and bottom based multipath delays were obtained using cepstrum method and these multipath delays were used to locate the target cepstrum method provides a summative expression of the reflection components resulting from the multipath channel ungp is punctured slowly over time because of especially corrosion based effects that is why it may not be possible for the receiver to capture the initial portions transient part of the leakage signal in this case it is not possible to obtain multipath delay information from the received periodic sine signal by cepstrum method and so the leakage cannot be located apart from these methods the fingerprint technique used in signal strength based positioning is a highly effective and common multipath channel effect mitigation approach and is used for underwater target localization koenig et al 2011 jaffe and wax 2014 dubrovinskaya et al 2017 lee et al 2009 according to the best of authors knowledge the fingerprint technique has not yet been used for locating leakages in ungps in this study k t h nearest neighbor knn algorithm based fingerprint technique is used to pinpoint leakages in ungps the underwater acoustic channel model proposed in qarabaqi and stojanovic 2013a is used as the channel model the success of the knn algorithm based fingerprint technique is examined for three different scenarios which are various receiver numbers sea wave heights and ambient noises the rest of the paper is organized as follows in section 2 the time varying multipath underwater acoustic channel which is used in this study is outlined in section 3 the localization system and method is described numerical results are given in section 4 and conclusions are summarized in section 5 2 underwater acoustic channel in the literature there is no consensus on which underwater acoustic channel model should be used because the underwater environment varies from region to region some channel models used in the literature are given as follows bellhop which is a beam tracing tool based on the ray theory models the underwater acoustic channel but ignores the random variations of the channel porter and bucker 1987 in heitsenrether and badiey 2004 the surface motion effect which is one of the effects of random variation of the underwater acoustic channel was adapted to the bellhop model however in heitsenrether and badiey 2004 the simulation results obtained for the proposed channel model at high wind speeds did not overlap with the measurement results virtual time series experiment virtex which is also a beam tracing tool models the channel statistically and has less computational complexity than bellhop peterson and porter 2013 on the other hand it may not be said that the computational complexity of virtex is sufficiently low numerous studies have been conducted to model the underwater acoustic channel stochastically qarabaqi and stojanovic 2009 radosevic et al 2009 socheleau et al 2009 galvin and coats 1996 qarabaqi and stojanovic 2011 tomasi et al 2010 yang and yang 2006 zhang et al 2010 in these studies channel models were created by analyzing acoustic data measurements taken from certain regions in some of these studies rician or rayleigh distribution was consistent with the measurements taken while in some the log normal distribution and the k distribution matched in other words since the characteristics of the seas are different from each other channel models which are compatible with different statistical distributions were proposed in the related studies therefore in these studies the proposed channel models for specific environments may not be applicable in different environments in comparison with the other channel models in the literature which are mentioned above the underwater acoustic channel is modeled in the most realistic way in qarabaqi and stojanovic 2013a the authors conducted a comprehensive mathematical analysis to describe the time varying underwater channel in this description most of the physical properties of acoustic propagation such as seabed and surface reflections random displacements and the resulting doppler effect frequency dependent attenuation were taken into account in qarabaqi and stojanovic 2013a underwater channel variations were classified as small scale variations and large scale variations depending on the size of random displacements of transmitter receivers due to sea flows sea surface mobility drifting etc small scale variations which are used to define scattering and motion based doppler effects are responsible for rapid changes in the instantaneous channel response large scale variations which influence the average of received signal strength are used to define position uncertainty due to changing system geometry and variable environmental conditions that is to say large scale variations are modeled as a result of random systemic displacements that lead to large changes in the gain and delay of propagation paths to sum up in a channel with constant geometry nominal channel the signals sent from the transmitter reach the receivers through paths with different directions of arrival and lengths large scale variations cause each propagation path to change randomly from the nominal value while small scale variations cause each propagation path to be scattered and subdivided into a number of intra paths the block diagram of this underwater acoustic channel which is often used in the literature kari et al 2017 pedrosa et al 2014 zhao et al 2017 is shown in fig 1 and transfer function of the channel is given in 1 1 h f h 0 f p h p γ p f e j 2 π f τ p here h 0 f p h p γ p f and τ p are the reference path transfer function number of paths path gain small scale fading coefficient and path delay respectively detailed information and equations about the variables are given in qarabaqi and stojanovic 2013a the analytical channel model proposed in qarabaqi and stojanovic 2013a was confirmed by experimental studies and the underwater acoustic channel simulator in qarabaqi and stojanovic 2013b was developed by the authors of the relevant study in this simulator simplified ray tracing software in which the sound speed is constant and the sea surface bottom is considered as smooth or alternatively bellhop ray tracing software is presented for large scale simulations for small scale simulations direct model or alternatively statistical equivalent model is presented 3 leakage localization for ungps in this study it is assumed that the receivers are hanged at a depth close to the ungp from the various number of buoys which are equally spaced it is supposed that the acoustic pressure signals received by these receivers are sent to the land station and where the leakage is pinpointed using the knn algorithm based fingerprint technique because the depth of the ungp is known and its diameter is small enough to be neglected the three dimensional localization problem can be reduced to one dimensional problem only the length axis of the pipeline therefore one dimensional localization is performed in this study proposed method is composed of two parts detection and localization basically in the detection part bandpass filters are used to detect leakage based signal if there is leakage signal then fingerprint method based localization part is initiated to locate the leakage acoustic pressure signals on the receiver side are sinusoidal signals with a constant frequency depending on the underwater acoustic channel and the leak hole diameter therefore at the detection part similar to mahmutoglu and turk 2018a the entire spectrum where the leakage based acoustic pressure signal may be present is swept through the 3 hz narrow band bandpass filters on the receiving side thus the transmit power of the acoustic pressure signal at the leak hole can be calculated using the frequency of the determined signal the parameters given in the numerical results section the corresponding equations given in mahmutoglu and turk 2018a and 2 subsequently the ambient noise effect is reduced by averaging the powers of the filtered signals for a while these processes are applied to the received signals in both the training and localization phases of the fingerprint method described below 2 p i 1 b p 0 e π δ f 0 t τ i c o s 2 π f 0 t τ i ϑ here p p 0 δ f 0 ϑ b t and τ i are acoustic pressure signal of a continuous sequence of bubbles peak acoustic pressure dissipation constant oscillation frequency phase angle the number of oscillating bubbles the time and the time delay between 1 t h and i t h bubbles detailed explanations and equations related to the mentioned variables are given in mahmutoglu and turk 2018a it is not possible to locate the leak hole with low errors without decreasing the fading effect which is as a result of position uncertainties scattering and moving sea surface effects in the variable channel despite the fact that the signal transmit power at the leak hole and the power it reaches to the receivers are known in this study knn algorithm based fingerprint technique is proposed for localization leakage localization process with the knn algorithm based fingerprint technique is performed in two phases as shown in fig 2 in both phases the above mentioned filtering and noise reduction procedures are applied to the received signals 1 training phase in the first phase known as the training phase it is assumed that there is a leak hole in the ungp and that the leak hole position is changed at short intervals throughout ungp thus for each leak hole position changed the average of the power of received signal without noise which varies over time according to the channel model is recorded and then the data sets fingerprint map to be used in localization are created the localization system and the average powers of the signals collected by the receivers for various leak hole positions are shown in fig 2 here m and n are the receiver number and the number of samples in each set of data created during the training phase respectively for x l x l 1 x l 2 x l n leak hole positions average powers of signals which are received by 1 t h 2 n d m t h receivers are p 1 p 11 p 12 p 1 n p 2 p 21 p 22 p 2 n p m p m 1 p m 2 p m n respectively these data sets can be expressed with the matrix in 3 where t refers to transposition 3 p p 1 t p 2 t p m t p 11 p m 1 p 1 n p m n 2 localization phase in the localization phase the average powers of the signals collected by the receivers for a leak hole with unknown position are matched with the data sets recorded in the training phase using a matching algorithm and the leak hole is positioned in this study due to its simplicity and its effectiveness in pinpointing the knn algorithm is used as matching algorithm liang et al 2012 li et al 2012 in the knn algorithm the euclidean distances between the average signal power data sets recorded in the training phase and the average powers of the signals reaching the receivers from a leak hole with unknown position are calculated using 4 then the calculated euclidean distances are sorted and k neighbors with the lowest distances are selected the leak hole position is obtained by averaging the selected k neighbors positions liang et al 2012 in the knn algorithm k is an integer between 1 and sample number of one of the training data sets to obtain the best performance from the knn algorithm k may be selected as 3 or 4 li et al 2012 4 d i s t i z 1 m p z i p z 2 here p p 1 p 2 p m is a data set of average powers of the signals that reach the receivers from the leak hole with unknown position p and i are average signal power data sets recorded during the training phase and the element index value in these datasets respectively 4 numerical results in the simulation studies to assess the positioning performance of the knn algorithm based fingerprint technique 10 km of a real life ungp with a gas flow rate of 136 m 3 s at a depth of 400 m is used as an example kandiyoti 2009 acoustic pressure signal for a continuous sequence of bubbles is generated using the following parameters the equations detailed in mahmutoglu and turk 2018a and 2 values of g gravitational acceleration h depth ρ density of water κ specific heat ratio τ delay between successive bubbles d r e f reference distance d h o l e diameter of the leak hole s bubble surface tension and q gas flow rate are 9 8 m s 2 400 m 1000 kg m 3 1 49 19 75 ms 1 m 1 mm 0 07423 n m and 136 m 3 s respectively in this study underwater acoustic channel simulator developed in qarabaqi and stojanovic 2013b is used as mentioned before in this simulator simplified ray tracing software in which the sound speed is constant and the sea surface bottom is considered as smooth or alternatively bellhop ray tracing software is presented for large scale simulations for small scale simulations direct model or alternatively statistical equivalent model is presented in bellhop software ray tracing is performed for a specific sound speed profile variation of sound speed depending on the depth and a specific seabed structure however ray tracing for a specific area may not be accurate for a different area because the sound speed profile and the seabed structure show regional differences therefore in this study similar to pedrosa et al 2014 instead of bellhop which has a higher computational complexity simplified ray tracing is used for large scale simulations in order to be more general and direct model is used for small scale simulations values of the parameters used in the underwater acoustic channel simulator are given in tables 1 and 2 where sd and psd are stand for standard deviation and power spectral density respectively the cut factor is used to limit the number of rays received the power of the direct path signal is divided by the cut factor and the signals whose power is below this value are ignored small scale simulation parameters are assumed to be constant for all paths large scale variations are restricted with h h s u r f the channel model equations using these parameters are described extensively in qarabaqi and stojanovic 2013a the following assumptions are made in the simulations during the training phase of the fingerprint method the position of the leak hole is changed from 0 to 10 km at intervals of 16 m to create a fingerprint map in this process surface wave height a w is taken as 4 m in the localization phase the position of the leak hole is changed from 0 to 10 km at 10 m intervals for various wave heights positions of 3 4 5 and 6 receivers which are used in various receiver numbers scenario are taken as 3 5 7 km 2 4 6 8 km 1 3 5 7 9 km and 1 2 6 4 2 5 8 7 4 9 km respectively in all other cases 4 receivers are used in the knn algorithm k is taken as 3 the ambient noise at the receivers is given for 3 hz bandwidth the number of monte carlo mc trials is taken as 1000 the performance of the method is examined for various ambient noises wave heights and receiver numbers in this study five different ambient noises which are n 1 n 2 n 3 n 4 and n 5 including all noise components thermal turbulence shipping and wave mentioned in mahmutoglu and turk 2018a are considered for these ambient noises the beaufort scale which shows the relationship between the observed sea conditions and the wind speeds is assumed as 8 19 m s wind speed mahmutoglu and turk 2017 and the shipping activity factors are considered as 0 1 0 3 0 5 0 7 and 1 respectively powers of the n 1 n 2 n 3 n 4 and n 5 ambient noises are 80 75 83 87 87 46 91 3 and 97 2 db re 1 μ pa respectively the relationship between the leak hole position and the root mean squared position error rmspe for 3 m wave height and n 3 ambient noise is shown in fig 3 here there is a symmetry between rmspes in the range of 0 5 km and 5 10 km as expected the sudden decreases and increases in rmspe values in the figure are due to the fading effect of the channel in fig 4 the relationships between shipping activity factors and the average of the rmspes obtained for the leak hole positions which are changed at 10 m intervals between 0 10 km are shown for wave heights of 1 m 2 m 3 m 4 m and 5 m as can be seen in the figure the increased shipping activity factor ambient noise power decreases positioning accuracy the wave height affects the positioning error significantly the relationship between the receiver number and the average rmspe for 1 m wave height and n 5 ambient noise is shown in fig 5 the relationships between position error and probability density for various receiver numbers are shown in fig 6 as expected the accuracy of positioning increases as the number of receivers increases probabilities of positioning errors being less than 100 m 200 m 300 m 400 m and 500 m for various receiver numbers are given in table 3 where rn stands for receiver number the relationships between position error and probability density for 1 m 3 m 5 m wave heights and n 1 n 5 ambient noises are shown in fig 7 the figure shows that as the power of ambient noise increases the probability curve becomes shorter and wider probabilities of positioning errors being less than 100 m 200 m 300 m 400 m and 500 m for 1 m 3 m 5 m wave heights and n 1 n 5 ambient noises are given in table 4 to the best of our knowledge there is no comprehensive study to compare our results in the literature undoubtedly the most accurate results can be obtained from experimental studies however it would be very difficult and costly to establish an experimental system which is at a depth of 400 m and has a very high gas pressure and flow rate to compare our simulation results

frequency parameters can be obtained through simulation works using the highly realistic underwater acoustic channel simulator and eq 2 which is well accepted in the literature to produce the acoustic pressure leakage signal then for the real leakage environment underwater that changes momentarily the appropriate one of the pre calculated fingerprint maps is selected and positioning is performed 5 conclusions in this study the knn algorithm based fingerprint technique is proposed to locate leakages in ungps in order to examine the success of the method a real life ungp is considered numerical

21852,water wave interaction with a circular barrier placed in the lower fluid of a medium comprised of two superposed fluids is investigated the topmost surface of this medium is covered by a thin sheet of ice the existence of two different incident waves along the ice covered surface and the interface gives rise to two different problems both the problems are tackled by transforming them into hypersingular integral equations for the jump in the potential across the circular barrier the integral equations are solved numerically and the solutions are used to find relevant physical quantities the qualitative features of these quantities are graphically analyzed by varying the arc length of the barrier the depth of their submergence the ice parameters and the depth ratio of the fluids the present results are compared successfully with previous results for a curved barrier present in a single layer fluid keywords circular barrier two superposed fluids ice cover hypersingular integral equation 1 introduction in recent years many scholars and engineering designers have turned their attention from gravity waves to flexural gravity waves through ice sheets because of an increase in scientific activities in the polar region for the purpose of analyzing the physical model the ice sheets can be regarded as thin elastic plates cf greenhill 1887 floating on the ocean such plates are also relevant for modeling very large floating structures vlfss in ocean engineering vlfss are artificial islands which might be built to make drifting airplane terminals breakwaters wind and solar power plants etc another application area of the hydroelasticity problems is associated with the understanding of different aspects of wave propagation in marginal ice zone miz in the antarctic where the miz is formed of broken ice or continuous sheets of ice a variety of wave structure interaction problems in a fluid region with an elastic plate can be found in bennetts and squire 2011 bhattacharjee and sahoo 2008 das and mandal 2006 2009 das et al 2018 kashiwagi 2000 mirafzali et al 2015 watanabe et al 2004 williams et al 2013a b and xu and lu 2011 an ocean whose upper surface is covered by a thin sheet of ice can be modeled as a two layer fluid the occurrence of two layers is due to the presence of the cold water with low salinity near the surface above the relatively warm ocean water with high salinity investigations of two layer fluid problems date back from the nineteenth century when stokes 1847 first investigated the wave propagation in two superposed fluids in the case of wave motion in such fluid medium there exist waves with two different wave modes cf lamb 1932 when the upper layer is finite and has a free surface cadby and linton 2000 linton and cadby 2002 linton and mciver 1995 determined the amount of energy that was transformed from one wave mode to another wave mode for the case of a cylinder present in either upper layer or in the lower layer of the fluid using the method of multipole expansion this technique was further used for solving flexural gravity wave interactions in two superposed fluids with a submerged body cf das and mandal 2007 2010 xu and lu 2010 applied the method of matched eigenfunction expansion to investigate wave scattering by semi infinite and finite elastic plates recently islam and gayen 2018 and paul and de 2018 employed hypersingular integral equation method to study wave diffraction by a rigid inclined plate and by a permeable vertical plate respectively in two superposed fluids the problems that involve scattering of water waves by a circular barrier have gained considerable importance in the last two decades the construction of such type of breakwaters is done because it reflects very less amount of incident wave energy and acts as a suitable model for a wave lens as pointed out by parsons and martin 1994 mciver and urka 1995 respectively curved structures may be conveniently used as elements of the wave energy converter as the waves past the structures converge at a point so that the wave energy can be extracted from the ocean waves the diffraction of water waves by a circular barrier present in a single layer fluid was first investigated by parsons and martin 1994 they reduced the governing boundary value problem to a hypersingular integral equation later on mciver and urka 1995 extended the problem of parsons and martin 1994 by using two different techniques one involving the method of matched eigenfunction expansion and the other involving a variational approximation method mandal and gayen 2002 employed the hypersingular integral equation method for solving diffraction of water waves by two symmetric circular barriers present in deep water liu and li 2012 have analyzed the wave interaction with submerged perforated semi circular breakwaters using a combination of multipole expansions all the works mentioned in the previous paragraph deal with barriers with curved geometry in a single layer fluid having a free surface however when there is a thin sheet of ice at the top of the fluid medium it is mathematically described by a fifth order boundary condition thus researchers are engaged in developing sophisticated methods to tackle the challenges associated with such complicated boundary condition and allied physical problem to the best of the authors knowledge the reflection and the transmission of flexural gravity waves with a barrier in the form of a circular arc submerged in two superposed fluids has not received much attention although these structures can reduce incident wave energy therefore the present work deals with the water wave diffraction by a circular barrier submerged in the lower fluid the upper fluid is covered by ice which can be modeled as a floating thin elastic plate the method of the hypersingular integral equation is considered to be a key technique in solving a variety of mixed boundary value problems arising in mathematical physics application of hypersingular integral equations may be found in the crack problems in fracture mechanics cf long and eshkuvatov 2009 water wave scattering and radiation problems in two and three dimensions cf farina et al 2017 gayen and mondal 2014 kundu et al 2018 mondal and banerjea 2016 heat transfer cf frankel 2007 acoustics cf demkowicz et al 1991 diffraction of electromagnetic waves cf davydov et al 2006 by employing the hypersingular integral equation method we calculate the reflection and the transmission coefficients and the wave load acting on the circular barrier effect of various parameters is illustrated graphically it is found that the reflection and the transmission coefficients depend on the arc length of the circular barrier the depth of their submergence the ice parameters and the depth ratio of the fluids it is also noticed that almost zero reflection occurs for the case of a full circular barrier submerged in the lower fluid of the ice covered fluid medium by adjusting suitable parameters we reduce the model of two superposed fluids to a single fluid model and validate the accuracy of the present numerical results by comparing them with those in mondal et al 2017 who analyzed the wave deformation by a circular porous barrier in the presence of a thin ice cover on the surface of the water the correctness of all the numerical values for the reflection and the transmission coefficients is also checked by using the energy identities although the mathematical technique use of hypersingular integral equations to solve the present problem is somewhat similar to that used in the works of islam and gayen 2018 and paul and de 2018 the major differences between this work and the previous two works is that in this paper we have considered the effect of presence of an ice cover on the diffraction of waves by a curved breakwater thus the contribution of the present study is two fold mathematically it describes a less complicated method to tackle the scattering of flexural gravity waves by a circular barrier submerged in a two layer fluid and from the engineering point of view we expect that the various results presented in section 5 might be of help to engineers for construction of circular breakwaters in a two fluid medium when the upper surface is covered by ice thin elastic plate 2 mathematical formulation for circular barrier as shown in fig 1 we consider a circular barrier γ of radius a with its center at 0 d a submerged in the lower fluid of a medium consisting of two superposed fluids the radius vectors of the upper and the lower end points of the circular barrier make angles γ and δ γ respectively with the upward vertical the upper fluid layer is covered by a thin layer of ice for analysis we choose the cartesian coordinate system x y with the origin at the interface the upper fluid of density ρ 1 is of depth h 1 and the lower fluid of density ρ 2 is of depth h 2 the two fluids are assumed to be incompressible inviscid and the fluid motion is irrotational and simple harmonic in time τ with angular frequency σ therefore the fluid motion is described by the velocity potentials φ j x y τ such that φ j x y τ r e g 2 σ 3 φ j x y e i σ τ where the subscripts j 1 2 refer to the upper and lower fluids respectively then the time independent potential functions φ j x y satisfy the following boundary value problem 2 1 2 φ j 0 in the water domain j together with the ice cover surface interface and rigid bottom boundary conditions 2 2 d 4 x 4 1 ε k φ 1 y k φ 1 0 on y h 1 2 3 φ 1 y

rigidity of the ice sheet h being the very small thickness of the ice sheet ρ i c e being the density of the ice sheet e and ν being the young s modulus and poisson s ratio of the material of the ice sheet respectively the derivation of condition 2 2 is given in appendix a1 the behavior of the potential function at the ends of the circular barrier is given by the condition 2 6 φ 2 o r 1 2 as r 0 where r denotes the distance of any point in the lower fluid region from any one end of the circular barrier also the condition on the surface of the circular barrier is given by 2 7 φ 2 n 0 on γ where the differentiation is taken along the normal direction we consider that the waves are coming from x thus the incident potential has the following form 2 8 φ j v i n c x y z j v y e i v x in the water domain j where 2 9 z 1 v y sinh v h 2 k cosh v h 1 v d v 4 1 ε k sinh v h 1 v d v 4 1 ε k cosh v h 1 y k sinh v h 1 y z 2 v y cosh v h 2 y and the incident potential of wave number v satisfies

above dispersion equation 2 10 has exactly two real and positive roots m 1 and m 2 say so that there exist two modes wave numbers of waves propagating along the upper surface and along the interface cf maiti and mandal 2008 the far field forms of the velocity potentials φ j j 1 2 can be expressed as follows for the incident wave of wave number m 1 the far field forms of φ j j 1 2 can be represented as cf islam and gayen 2018 2 11 φ j x y z j m 1 y e i m 1 x r m 1 e i m 1 x r m 1 z j m 2 y e i m 2 x as x r m 1 z j m 1 y e i m 1 x r m 1 z j m 2 y e i m 2 x as x whereas the far field forms of φ j for the incident wave of wave number m 2 can be represented as 2 12 φ j x y z j m 2 y e i m 2 x r m 2 e i m 2 x r m 2 z j m 1 y e i m 1 x as x r m 2 z j m 2 y e i m 2 x r m 2 z j m 1 y e i m 1 x as x if the incident wave is of wave number m 1 then the unknown coefficients r m 1 and r m 1 are used to represent the reflection and the transmission coefficients corresponding to the waves of wave number m 1 while r m 1 and r m 1 are used for waves of wave number m 2 similarly if the incident wave is of wave number m 2 the corresponding notations are r m 2 r m 2 r m 2 and r m 2 due to the propagation of waves with two different wave numbers we need to solve two separate boundary value problems which we refer to as bvp i and bvp ii both these problems consist of solving equations 2 1 2 7 and 2 11 for bvp i and 2 12 for bvp ii in the next section we briefly outline the method of solving bvp i and bvp ii 3 reduction to singular integral equation and solution method in order to transform the boundary value problems bvp i and bvp ii to a boundary integral equation on the circular barrier we employ green s integral theorem to suitable green s functions g j x y ξ η j 1 2 and the scattered velocity potentials φ ˆ j ν φ j x y φ j ν i n c x y in the form 3 1 dω j φ ˆ j ν g j n g j φ ˆ j ν n d s 0 j 1 2 here ν stands for the wave number m 1 or m 2 according as we consider bvp i or bvp ii dω j is the closed boundary of the j t h fluid region and g j x y ξ η represent the green s functions in the upper and the lower layer when a source point ξ η is located in the lower fluid the derivation of g j and their asymptotic expressions are given in the appendix a2 when j 1 we take the boundary dω 1 which is bounded externally by the lines y h 1 0 x x x x x h 1 y 0 finally making x we obtain 3 2 φ ˆ 1 ν g 1 y g 1 φ ˆ 1 ν y y h 1 d x h 1 0 φ ˆ 1 ν g 1 x g 1 φ ˆ 1 ν x x d y φ ˆ 1 ν g 1 y g 1 φ ˆ 1 ν y y 0 d x h 1 0 φ ˆ 1 ν g 1 x g 1 φ ˆ 1 ν x x d y 0 for j 2 we choose the boundary dω 2 which is bounded externally by the lines y 0 h 2 x x x x x 0 y h 2 and internally by a small circle of radius ε with center at ξ η and the contour enclosing the plate γ into both sides of the plate finally making x ε 0 and shrinking the contour enclosing the plate along their sides we find 3 3 2 π φ ˆ 2 ν ξ η γ φ 2 q 1 φ 2 q 1 g 2 x y ξ η n q 1 d s q 1 0 h 2 φ ˆ 2 ν g 2 x g 2 φ ˆ 2

forms of φ ˆ 1 ν φ 1 φ 1 ν i n c and g 1 we find that there will be no contribution from the line y h 1 x x x as x cf mandal and basu 2004 multiplying equation 3 3 by ρ and adding it to equation 3 5 and using the interface conditions with the fact that 3 4 ρ h 1 0 φ ˆ 1 ν g 1 x g 1 φ ˆ 1 ν x x x d y 0 h 2 φ ˆ 2 ν g 2 x g 2 φ ˆ 2 ν x x x d y 0 as x we find an expression for the velocity potential in the lower layer as given by 3 5 φ 2 ξ η z 2 ν η e i ν ξ 1 2 π γ c ν q 1 g 2 x y ξ η n q 1 d s q 1 here c ν q 1 φ 2 q 1 φ 2 q 1 is the jump in the potential function φ 2 across the circular barrier γ and therefore it must vanish at the edges of γ the boundary condition of vanishing of the normal derivative of the potential function on the circular barrier enables us to find an integral equation satisfied by c ν q 1 thus applying the normal derivative on both sides of equation 3 7 at a different point q 2 ξ η on γ and using the boundary condition on the circular barrier 2 7 we obtain 3 6 the above equation is a hypersingular integral equation where the sign x on the integral is understood as hadamard finite part integral to convert the above hypersingular integral equation into a computable form we need the following parametrization of various quantities involving in it thus n q 1 sin ϕ t 1 cos ϕ t 1 n q 2 sin ϕ t 2 cos ϕ t 2 where ϕ t 1 t 2 γ δ 2 γ δ 2 t 1 t 2 1 t 1 t 2 1 x a sin ϕ t 1 y d a 1 cos ϕ t 1 1 t 1 1 ξ a sin ϕ t 2 η d a 1 cos ϕ t 2 1 t 2 1 this yields a computable form of the integral equation as 3 7 where 3 8 w t 2 ν 2 π ν a θsinh ν h 2 d a a cos ϕ t 2 i ϕ t 2 e i ν a sin ϕ t 2 θ δ γ 2 in the above equation k r t 1 t 2 is the regular part of the kernel and its form is given in the appendix a3 to solve the hypersingular part in equation 3 7 analytically we consider the expansion of the unknown function c ν t 1 given as 3 9 c ν t 1 1 t 1 2 n n 0 c n ν u n t 1 where c n ν are unknown coefficients to be determined u n t 1 is the chebyshev polynomial of the second kind the weight function 1 t 1 2 assures that the solution to the integral equation 3 7 has the correct behaviour at the edges of the circular barrier and thus consistent with the condition 2 6 substituting the expansion 3 9 in 3 7 and collocating at the points t 2 i cos 2 i 1 2 n 2 π i 0 1 n we get a system of n 1 linear equations with n 1 unknowns given as 3 10 h c ν w ν where h h n i n 1 n 1 c ν c n ν n 1 1 and w ν w t 2 i ν n 1 1 n 0 1 n i 0 1 n the expression of h n i is given by h n i π n 1 u n t 2 i 1 1 1 t 1 2 k r t 2 i t 1 u n t 1 d t 1 after obtaining the unknown coefficients c n ν from the above system of equations in the following subsection we briefly outline the process of computing the reflection and the transmission coefficients and the wave load acting on the circular barrier 3 1 reflection and transmission coefficients for bvp i and bvp ii in this subsection we determine the quantities r ν r ν and r ν r ν by using the asymptotic forms of φ 2 ξ η and the green s function g 2 thus we take ξ on both sides of equation 3 5 then using the radiation conditions satisfied by φ 2 and the asymptotic expressions of g 2 we obtain the reflection and the transmission coefficients in the upper fluid layer due to the incident waves of both modes as 3 11 r ν p ν p m 1 1 1 c ν t 1 sin h m 1 h 2 d a a cos ϕ t 1 i ϕ t 1 e i m 1 a sin ϕ t 1 d t 1 p ν p m 1 n 0 n c n ν 1 1 sin h m 1 h 2 d a a cos ϕ t 1 i ϕ t 1 e i m 1 a sin ϕ t 1 1 t 1 2 u n t 1 d t 1 similarly the reflection and the transmission coefficients in the lower fluid layer due to the incident waves of both modes are determined as 3 12 r ν q ν p m 2 n 0 n c n ν 1 1 sin h m 2 h 2 d a a cos ϕ t 1 i ϕ t 1 e i m 2 a sin ϕ t 1 1 t 1 2 u n t 1 d t 1 here p m 1 0 p m 1 1 p m 2 0 q m 1 0 q m 2 0 q m 2 1 and p ν

for this we first notice that the pressure p 2 x y τ at any point x y in the lower fluid region is connected to the velocity potential φ 2 x y τ by the following relation 3 13 p 2 x y τ ρ 2 φ 2 x y τ τ ρ 2 g y r e i ρ 2 g 2 σ 2 φ 2 x y e i σ τ ρ 2 g y therefore the hydrodynamic force in the ν th mode acting on the circular barrier is computed as 3 14 z ν ρ 2 g k r e i γ c ν q 1 d s q 1 at τ 0 ρ 2 g k r e i a θ n 0 n c n ν 1 1 1 t 1 2 u n t 1 d t 1 from the above equation the dimensionless hydrodynamic force in the ν th mode is represented as 3 15 f ν k z ν ρ 2 g a r e iθ n 0 n c n ν 1 1 1 t 1 2 u n t 1 d t 1 4 energy identity relations energy balance relations provide the accuracy of our analytical as well as numerical values for the reflection and the transmission coefficients in a medium consisting of two superposed fluids there exist two energy balance relations using the modified green s second identity to appropriate functions the energy identities involving coefficients r ν r ν r ν and r ν are calculated as 4 1 r ν 2 r ν 2 j r ν 2 r ν 2 z ν ν m 1 m 2 where z m 1 1 z m 2 j and j j m 2 j m 1 with 4 2 j ν i ν d ν 4 1 ε k ρ h 1 0 f 1 ν y 2 d y 0 h 2 cos h ν h 2 y 2 d y ν m 1 m 2 to show the correctness of our numerical values computed here we present the tables 1 and 2 in both the tables the numerical estimates of the reflection and the transmission coefficients are presented for discrete values of k h 1 with d h 1 4 1 5 ε h 1 0 01 γ π 4 δ π 2 d h 1 0 1 h 2 h 1 2 and ρ 0 5 it is clearly observed from both tables that the energy balance relations are satisfied almost accurately 5 numerical results in this section the effect of different parameters such as the arc length of the barrier the depth of their submergence the ice parameters and the depth ratio of the fluids on the reflection coefficient are discussed because our aim is to examine the reflective properties of the circular barrier when a train of waves interacts with circular barrier to check the accuracy of our present analysis in fig 2 we compare our results with those presented in mondal et al 2017 fig 2 describes the reflection coefficient for ρ 1 and h 1 0 in this case the fluid medium consists of only one layer having uniform finite depth h 2 for this situation the graphs with d h 2 0 1 d h 2 4 0 5 ε h 2 0 01 γ π 4 δ π 2 and a h 2 0 5 for the reflection coefficient are obtained by mondal et al 2017 which are plotted in fig 2 by star marks the reflection coefficient calculated from the present analysis is plotted by a solid line from this figure it is visible that the present results agree well with those of mondal et al 2017 next we compare the results for the reflection coefficient with those in mciver and urka 1995 where they considered the scattering of water waves by a circular arc shaped plate submerged in a single layer fluid of deep water taking d a 0 25 d h 2 0 1 d h 2 4 0 ε h 2 0 γ 54 o δ 54 o ρ 1 and h 1 0 the reflection coefficient of the present problem is plotted in fig 3 it is visible from this figure that the present results agree well with those of mciver and urka 1995 to illustrate the effect of the depth of submergence of the circular barrier the reflection coefficients r m 1 and r m 1 are plotted in fig 4 a and b respectively for three different submergence depths d h 1 0 1 0 3 0 5 with γ π 4 δ π 2 d h 1 4 1 5 ε h 1 0 01 h 2 h 1 2 ρ 0 5 it is observed from these two figures that the reflection coefficients increase when the distance of the circular barrier below the undisturbed mean interface decreases this is quite plausible because in this situation the effect of interface wave on the circular barrier increases the role of the arc length of the circular barrier on the reflection coefficients r m 1 and r m 1 is analyzed in figs 5 and 6 in fig 5 a and b the value of γ is kept fixed at γ 45 o and three different values of δ are considered whereas in fig 6 a and b δ is kept fix at δ 90 o and the value of γ is varying for these figures the values of the other parameters are taken as d h 1 0 1 d h 1 4 1 5 ε h 1 0 01 h 2 h 1 2 ρ 0 5 it is noticed from these figures that as the arc length increases the amount of the reflection coefficients increase because a plate with greater arc length puts more resistance in the propagation of waves when a long horizontal circular cylinder is presented in the lower fluid of two superposed fluids where the upper fluid is of finite depth and is covered by a thin layer of ice and the lower fluid is infinitely deep and a train of waves normally interacts upon it das and mandal 2007 obtained zero reflections for any wave number to examine whether such case also happens when the cylinder is presented in the lower fluid of a two layer ice covered fluid where both the layers of the fluid are of uniform finite depth we consider a vertical cross section of a long horizontal circular cylinder therefore the reflection coefficients for the case of an almost full circular barrier γ 45 o δ 404 o are shown in fig 5 a and b it is observed that almost zero reflections occur for any wave number thus the phenomenon of nearly zero reflection also holds very well for the case of a two layer ice covered fluid where both the layers of the fluid are taken to be of uniform finite depth it is noticed from fig 5 that the reflection is maximum when δ 120 o this is because δ 120 o implies a portion of an open cylinder having two edges as the normally incident waves interact with these edges a substantial amount of waves is reflected however as δ increases the barrier tends to occupy the shape of a full circle thus the edge effect becomes less and the incident wave experiences less hindrance so most of the waves are transmitted past the almost full circular cylinder fig 7 a and b demonstrate the effect of the rigidity of the ice cover on the reflection coefficients r m and r m it is noticed from fig 7 a that in the upper layer the reflection coefficient r m 1 decreases with increasing stiffness of the ice cover thus a thicker ice sheet reduces the reflected wave further it is observed in fig 7 b that the reflections in the lower layer are almost the same for various values of the ice cover parameter this is because the ice sheet is above the lower layer and has less effect on the interface wave propagation in fig 8 a and b the reflection coefficients r m 1 and r m 1 are depicted for three different values of the depth ratios h 2 h 1 2 4 10 from these figures it is noticed that in the upper layer the reflection coefficient r m 1 attains the highest peak for h 2 h 1 10 and lowest peak for h 2 h 1 2 however the general pattern of the reflected wave r m 1 is not significantly affected by varying the depth of the lower layer on the other hand when the interface approaches the seabed the reflections in the lower layer increase significantly this happens because as the interface is close to the seabed wave concentration in internal mode increases significantly if the incident wave is of wave number m 2 the reflection coefficients r m 2 and r m 2 are plotted in figs 9 12 for various values of submergence depth of the circular barrier the arc length of the circular barrier and the ice parameters respectively similar nature as noticed in the case of the incident wave of wave number m 1 is also observed in the case of the incident wave of wave number m 2 further it is clear that for the case of the incident wave of wave number m 1 the reflected wave energy in the upper layer is larger as compared with that in the lower layer but in the case of the incident wave of wave number m 2 the reflected wave energy is more in the lower layer compared to that in the upper layer in fig 13 a and b we display the effect of the rigidity of the ice cover on the hydrodynamic forces f m 1 and f m 2 due to incident waves with wave numbers m 1 and m 2 respectively it is observed that for the case of the incident wave of wave number m 1 the circular barrier experiences less hydrodynamics force as the value of the ice cover parameter increases this study might be helpful to protect the coastal area on the other hand in the case of the incident wave of wave number m 2 the circular barrier experiences almost the same hydrodynamic force as the ice cover is approximated by a rigid lid fig 14 a and b depicts the effect of the position of the interface on the hydrodynamic forces f m 1 and f m 2 for different values of h 2 h 1 2 4 10 from fig 14 a it is noticed that the hydrodynamics force f m 2 is not significantly affected by the change in the value of h 2 h 1 however fig 14 b reveals that as the interface is close to the seabed the wave load on the plate increases significantly this is due to the influence of the seabed the hydrodynamic forces f m 1 and f m 2 acting on the circular barrier are presented graphically in fig 15 a and b for the different arc length of the circular barrier it is observed that as the arc length of the circular barrier increases the amount of the hydrodynamic forces increase this is expected because a longer plate will oppose more waves which leads to higher wave load on the circular barrier however it is observed from these figures that for the case of an almost full circular barrier γ 45 o δ 404 o the wave load on the plate decreases 6 conclusion the effect of a floating ice cover on a circular barrier situated in the lower fluid of a stratified fluid medium has been considered the governing boundary value problems have been tackled by reducing them into hypersingular integral equations these equations are solved by an approximate numerical method the solutions are utilized to find the reflection and the transmission coefficients and the wave load acting on the circular barrier and have presented through graphs the conclusions that can be drawn from the presented graphs are 1 reflection coefficients at the upper and lower fluid layer due to incident wave of ν th m 1 m 2 mode decrease as the submergence depth of the plate increases but increase as the arc length of the plate increases 2 almost zero reflection occurs for the case of an almost full circular barrier placed in the lower layer of two layer finite depth water with an ice cover 3 a thicker ice sheet reduces the reflected wave in the upper layer due to incident wave of ν th m 1 m 2 mode however the reflected wave energy in the lower layer remains almost the same 4 the reflected wave energy in the lower layer decreases with the depth ratio whereas in the upper layer it is not significantly affected by the change in the value of h 2 h 1 5 in the surface wave mode the rigidity of the ice sheet reduces the effect of wave load while in the interface wave mode the circular barrier experiences almost the same hydrodynamic force 6 the wave load on the circular barrier in the case of surface mode is not significantly affected by varying the depth of the lower layer however in the case of internal mode when the interface is close to the seabed the wave load on the circular barrier increases significantly in the present analysis we have restricted the plate position within the lower fluid however similar analysis may be employed when the plate is entirely situated in the upper fluid also a somewhat similar approach based on hypersingular integral equation formulation may be employed to deal with a curved plate which penetrates the interface cf islam and gayen 2018 the results obtained in the present manuscript are somewhat new in the context of a two layer fluid and we believe that these may be helpful to marine engineers during construction of curved breakwaters in a stratified fluid authors contribution najnin islam formulated the problem and carried out the mathematical and numerical computations r gayen proposed the problem gave some ideas to solve the integral equations and made the final draft of the paper declaration of competing interest we confirm that there is no financial personal interest or belief that could affect our objectivity acknowledgement the authors are thankful to the reviewers for their constructive suggestions to revise the paper appendix a1 here the steps for derivation of the ice covered surface condition appearing in equation 2 2 are shown in brief if ζ x τ denotes the displacement of the ice covered surface then newton s equation of motion for a small element of the ice covered surface produces cf fox and squire 1994 a1 1 ε ρ 1 2 ζ τ 2 ε ρ 1 g p p l 4 x 4 ζ on y h 1 where p is the fluid pressure acting at the lower surface of the ice sheet and p is the atmospheric pressure again the linearized version of bernoulli s equation gives the fluid pressure p in the form a1 2 p ρ 1 g ζ φ 1 τ

21852,water wave interaction with a circular barrier placed in the lower fluid of a medium comprised of two superposed fluids is investigated the topmost surface of this medium is covered by a thin sheet of ice the existence of two different incident waves along the ice covered surface and the interface gives rise to two different problems both the problems are tackled by transforming them into hypersingular integral equations for the jump in the potential across the circular barrier the integral equations are solved numerically and the solutions are used to find relevant physical quantities the qualitative features of these quantities are graphically analyzed by varying the arc length of the barrier the depth of their submergence the ice parameters and the depth ratio of the fluids the present results are compared successfully with previous results for a curved barrier present in a single layer fluid keywords circular barrier two superposed fluids ice cover hypersingular integral equation 1 introduction in recent years many scholars and engineering designers have turned their attention from gravity waves to flexural gravity waves through ice sheets because of an increase in scientific activities in the polar region for the purpose of analyzing the physical model the ice sheets can be regarded as thin elastic plates cf greenhill 1887 floating on the ocean such plates are also relevant for modeling very large floating structures vlfss in ocean engineering vlfss are artificial islands which might be built to make drifting airplane terminals breakwaters wind and solar power plants etc another application area of the hydroelasticity problems is associated with the understanding of different aspects of wave propagation in marginal ice zone miz in the antarctic where the miz is formed of broken ice or continuous sheets of ice a variety of wave structure interaction problems in a fluid region with an elastic plate can be found in bennetts and squire 2011 bhattacharjee and sahoo 2008 das and mandal 2006 2009 das et al 2018 kashiwagi 2000 mirafzali et al 2015 watanabe et al 2004 williams et al 2013a b and xu and lu 2011 an ocean whose upper surface is covered by a thin sheet of ice can be modeled as a two layer fluid the occurrence of two layers is due to the presence of the cold water with low salinity near the surface above the relatively warm ocean water with high salinity investigations of two layer fluid problems date back from the nineteenth century when stokes 1847 first investigated the wave propagation in two superposed fluids in the case of wave motion in such fluid medium there exist waves with two different wave modes cf lamb 1932 when the upper layer is finite and has a free surface cadby and linton 2000 linton and cadby 2002 linton and mciver 1995 determined the amount of energy that was transformed from one wave mode to another wave mode for the case of a cylinder present in either upper layer or in the lower layer of the fluid using the method of multipole expansion this technique was further used for solving flexural gravity wave interactions in two superposed fluids with a submerged body cf das and mandal 2007 2010 xu and lu 2010 applied the method of matched eigenfunction expansion to investigate wave scattering by semi infinite and finite elastic plates recently islam and gayen 2018 and paul and de 2018 employed hypersingular integral equation method to study wave diffraction by a rigid inclined plate and by a permeable vertical plate respectively in two superposed fluids the problems that involve scattering of water waves by a circular barrier have gained considerable importance in the last two decades the construction of such type of breakwaters is done because it reflects very less amount of incident wave energy and acts as a suitable model for a wave lens as pointed out by parsons and martin 1994 mciver and urka 1995 respectively curved structures may be conveniently used as elements of the wave energy converter as the waves past the structures converge at a point so that the wave energy can be extracted from the ocean waves the diffraction of water waves by a circular barrier present in a single layer fluid was first investigated by parsons and martin 1994 they reduced the governing boundary value problem to a hypersingular integral equation later on mciver and urka 1995 extended the problem of parsons and martin 1994 by using two different techniques one involving the method of matched eigenfunction expansion and the other involving a variational approximation method mandal and gayen 2002 employed the hypersingular integral equation method for solving diffraction of water waves by two symmetric circular barriers present in deep water liu and li 2012 have analyzed the wave interaction with submerged perforated semi circular breakwaters using a combination of multipole expansions all the works mentioned in the previous paragraph deal with barriers with curved geometry in a single layer fluid having a free surface however when there is a thin sheet of ice at the top of the fluid medium it is mathematically described by a fifth order boundary condition thus researchers are engaged in developing sophisticated methods to tackle the challenges associated with such complicated boundary condition and allied physical problem to the best of the authors knowledge the reflection and the transmission of flexural gravity waves with a barrier in the form of a circular arc submerged in two superposed fluids has not received much attention although these structures can reduce incident wave energy therefore the present work deals with the water wave diffraction by a circular barrier submerged in the lower fluid the upper fluid is covered by ice which can be modeled as a floating thin elastic plate the method of the hypersingular integral equation is considered to be a key technique in solving a variety of mixed boundary value problems arising in mathematical physics application of hypersingular integral equations may be found in the crack problems in fracture mechanics cf long and eshkuvatov 2009 water wave scattering and radiation problems in two and three dimensions cf farina et al 2017 gayen and mondal 2014 kundu et al 2018 mondal and banerjea 2016 heat transfer cf frankel 2007 acoustics cf demkowicz et al 1991 diffraction of electromagnetic waves cf davydov et al 2006 by employing the hypersingular integral equation method we calculate the reflection and the transmission coefficients and the wave load acting on the circular barrier effect of various parameters is illustrated graphically it is found that the reflection and the transmission coefficients depend on the arc length of the circular barrier the depth of their submergence the ice parameters and the depth ratio of the fluids it is also noticed that almost zero reflection occurs for the case of a full circular barrier submerged in the lower fluid of the ice covered fluid medium by adjusting suitable parameters we reduce the model of two superposed fluids to a single fluid model and validate the accuracy of the present numerical results by comparing them with those in mondal et al 2017 who analyzed the wave deformation by a circular porous barrier in the presence of a thin ice cover on the surface of the water the correctness of all the numerical values for the reflection and the transmission coefficients is also checked by using the energy identities although the mathematical technique use of hypersingular integral equations to solve the present problem is somewhat similar to that used in the works of islam and gayen 2018 and paul and de 2018 the major differences between this work and the previous two works is that in this paper we have considered the effect of presence of an ice cover on the diffraction of waves by a curved breakwater thus the contribution of the present study is two fold mathematically it describes a less complicated method to tackle the scattering of flexural gravity waves by a circular barrier submerged in a two layer fluid and from the engineering point of view we expect that the various results presented in section 5 might be of help to engineers for construction of circular breakwaters in a two fluid medium when the upper surface is covered by ice thin elastic plate 2 mathematical formulation for circular barrier as shown in fig 1 we consider a circular barrier γ of radius a with its center at 0 d a submerged in the lower fluid of a medium consisting of two superposed fluids the radius vectors of the upper and the lower end points of the circular barrier make angles γ and δ γ respectively with the upward vertical the upper fluid layer is covered by a thin layer of ice for analysis we choose the cartesian coordinate system x y with the origin at the interface the upper fluid of density ρ 1 is of depth h 1 and the lower fluid of density ρ 2 is of depth h 2 the two fluids are assumed to be incompressible inviscid and the fluid motion is irrotational and simple harmonic in time τ with angular frequency σ therefore the fluid motion is described by the velocity potentials φ j x y τ such that φ j x y τ r e g 2 σ 3 φ j x y e i σ τ where the subscripts j 1 2 refer to the upper and lower fluids respectively then the time independent potential functions φ j x y satisfy the following boundary value problem 2 1 2 φ j 0 in the water domain j together with the ice cover surface interface and rigid bottom boundary conditions 2 2 d 4 x 4 1 ε k φ 1 y k φ 1 0 on y h 1 2 3 φ 1 y φ 2 y on y 0 2 4 ρ k φ 1 φ 1 y k φ 2 φ 2 y on y 0 2 5 φ 2 y 0 on y h 2 here ρ ρ 1 ρ 2 1 k σ 2 g g is the gravitational acceleration d l ρ 1 g and ε ρ i c e ρ 1 h l e h 3 12 1 ν 2 being the flexural rigidity of the ice sheet h being the very small thickness of the ice sheet ρ i c e being the density of the ice sheet e and ν being the young s modulus and poisson s ratio of the material of the ice sheet respectively the derivation of condition 2 2 is given in appendix a1 the behavior of the potential function at the ends of the circular barrier is given by the condition 2 6 φ 2 o r 1 2 as r 0 where r denotes the distance of any point in the lower fluid region from any one end of the circular barrier also the condition on the surface of the circular barrier is given by 2 7 φ 2 n 0 on γ where the differentiation is taken along the normal direction we consider that the waves are coming from x thus the incident potential has the following form 2 8 φ j v i n c x y z j v y e i v x in the water domain j where 2 9 z 1 v y sinh v h 2 k cosh v h 1 v d v 4 1 ε k sinh v h 1 v d v 4 1 ε k cosh v h 1 y k sinh v h 1 y z 2 v y cosh v h 2 y and the incident potential of wave number v satisfies the dispersion equation 2 10 δ v v 2 1 ρ d v 4 1 ε k ρ k 2 sin h v h 1 sin h v h 2 k 2 cos h v h 1 cos h v h 2 k v d v 4 1 ε k sin h v h 1 cos h v h 2 k v 1 ρ d v 4 ε k cos h v h 1 sin h v h 2 0 the above dispersion equation 2 10 has exactly two real and positive roots m 1 and m 2 say so that there exist two modes wave numbers of waves propagating along the upper surface and along the interface cf maiti and mandal 2008 the far field forms of the velocity potentials φ j j 1 2 can be expressed as follows for the incident wave of wave number m 1 the far field forms of φ j j 1 2 can be represented as cf islam and gayen 2018 2 11 φ j x y z j m 1 y e i m 1 x r m 1 e i m 1 x r m 1 z j m 2 y e i m 2 x as x r m 1 z j m 1 y e i m 1 x r m 1 z j m 2 y e i m 2 x as x whereas the far field forms of φ j for the incident wave of wave number m 2 can be represented as 2 12 φ j x y z j m 2 y e i m 2 x r m 2 e i m 2 x r m 2 z j m 1 y e i m 1 x as x r m 2 z j m 2 y e i m 2 x r m 2 z j m 1 y e i m 1 x as x if the incident wave is of wave number m 1 then the unknown coefficients r m 1 and r m 1 are used to represent the reflection and the transmission coefficients corresponding to the waves of wave number m 1 while r m 1 and r m 1 are used for waves of wave number m 2 similarly if the incident wave is of wave number m 2 the corresponding notations are r m 2 r m 2 r m 2 and r m 2 due to the propagation of waves with two different wave numbers we need to solve two separate boundary value problems which we refer to as bvp i and bvp ii both these problems consist of solving equations 2 1 2 7 and 2 11 for bvp i and 2 12 for bvp ii in the next section we briefly outline the method of solving bvp i and bvp ii 3 reduction to singular integral equation and solution method in order to transform the boundary value problems bvp i and bvp ii to a boundary integral equation on the circular barrier we employ green s integral theorem to suitable green s functions g j x y ξ η j 1 2 and the scattered velocity potentials φ ˆ j ν φ j x y φ j ν i n c x y in the form 3 1 dω j φ ˆ j ν g j n g j φ ˆ j ν n d s 0 j 1 2 here ν stands for the wave number m 1 or m 2 according as we consider bvp i or bvp ii dω j is the closed boundary of the j t h fluid region and g j x y ξ η represent the green s functions in the upper and the lower layer when a source point ξ η is located in the lower fluid the derivation of g j and their asymptotic expressions are given in the appendix a2 when j 1 we take the boundary dω 1 which is bounded externally by the lines y h 1 0 x x x x x h 1 y 0 finally making x we obtain 3 2 φ ˆ 1 ν g 1 y g 1 φ ˆ 1 ν y y h 1 d x h 1 0 φ ˆ 1 ν g 1 x g 1 φ ˆ 1 ν x x d y φ ˆ 1 ν g 1 y g 1 φ ˆ 1 ν y y 0 d x h 1 0 φ ˆ 1 ν g 1 x g 1 φ ˆ 1 ν x x d y 0 for j 2 we choose the boundary dω 2 which is bounded externally by the lines y 0 h 2 x x x x x 0 y h 2 and internally by a small circle of radius ε with center at ξ η and the contour enclosing the plate γ into both sides of the plate finally making x ε 0 and shrinking the contour enclosing the plate along their sides we find 3 3 2 π φ ˆ 2 ν ξ η γ φ 2 q 1 φ 2 q 1 g 2 x y ξ η n q 1 d s q 1 0 h 2 φ ˆ 2 ν g 2 x g 2 φ ˆ 2

forms of φ ˆ 1 ν φ 1 φ 1 ν i n c and g 1 we find that there will be no contribution from the line y h 1 x x x as x cf mandal and basu 2004 multiplying equation 3 3 by ρ and adding it to equation 3 5 and using the interface conditions with the fact that 3 4 ρ h 1 0 φ ˆ 1 ν g 1 x g 1 φ ˆ 1 ν x x x d y 0 h 2 φ ˆ 2 ν g 2 x g 2 φ ˆ 2 ν x x x d y 0 as x we find an expression for the velocity potential in the lower layer as given by 3 5 φ 2 ξ η z 2 ν η e i ν ξ 1 2 π γ c ν q 1 g 2 x y ξ η n q 1 d s q 1 here c ν q 1 φ 2 q 1 φ 2 q 1 is the jump in the potential function φ 2 across the circular barrier γ and therefore it must vanish at the edges of γ the boundary condition of vanishing of the normal derivative of the potential function on the circular barrier enables us to find an integral equation satisfied by c ν q 1 thus applying the normal derivative on both sides of equation 3 7 at a different point q 2 ξ η on γ and using the boundary condition on the circular barrier 2 7 we obtain 3 6 the above equation is a hypersingular integral equation where the sign x on the integral is understood as hadamard finite part integral to convert the above hypersingular integral equation into a computable form we need the following parametrization of various quantities involving in it thus n q 1 sin ϕ t 1 cos ϕ t 1 n q 2 sin ϕ t 2 cos ϕ t 2 where ϕ t 1 t 2 γ δ 2 γ δ 2 t 1 t 2 1 t 1 t 2 1 x a sin ϕ t 1 y d a 1 cos ϕ t 1 1 t 1 1 ξ a sin ϕ t 2 η d a 1 cos ϕ t 2 1 t 2 1 this yields a computable form of the integral equation as 3 7 where 3 8 w t 2 ν 2 π ν a θsinh ν h 2 d a a cos ϕ t 2 i ϕ t 2 e i ν a sin ϕ t 2 θ δ γ 2 in the above equation k r t 1 t 2 is the regular part of the kernel and its form is given in the appendix a3 to solve the hypersingular part in equation 3 7 analytically we consider the expansion of the unknown function c ν t 1 given as 3 9 c ν t 1 1 t 1 2 n n 0 c n ν u n t 1 where c n ν are unknown coefficients to be determined u n t 1 is the chebyshev polynomial of the second kind the weight function 1 t 1 2 assures that the solution to the integral equation 3 7 has the correct behaviour at the edges of the circular barrier and thus consistent with the condition 2 6 substituting the expansion 3 9 in 3 7 and collocating at the points t 2 i cos 2 i 1 2 n 2 π i 0 1 n we get a system of n 1 linear equations with n 1 unknowns given as 3 10 h c ν w ν where h h n i n 1 n 1 c ν c n ν n 1 1 and w ν w t 2 i ν n 1 1 n 0 1 n i 0 1 n the expression of h n i is given by h n i π n 1 u n t 2 i 1 1 1 t 1 2 k r t 2 i t 1 u n t 1 d t 1 after obtaining the unknown coefficients c n ν from the above system of equations in the following subsection we briefly outline the process of computing the reflection and the transmission coefficients and the wave load acting on the circular barrier 3 1 reflection and transmission coefficients for bvp i and bvp ii in this subsection we determine the quantities r ν r ν and r ν r ν by using the asymptotic forms of φ 2 ξ η and the green s function g 2 thus we take ξ on both sides of equation 3 5 then using the radiation conditions satisfied by φ 2 and the asymptotic expressions of g 2 we obtain the reflection and the transmission coefficients in the upper fluid layer due to the incident waves of both modes as 3 11 r ν p ν p m 1 1 1 c ν t 1 sin h m 1 h 2 d a a cos ϕ t 1 i ϕ t 1 e i m 1 a sin ϕ t 1 d t 1 p ν p m 1 n 0 n c n ν 1 1 sin h m 1 h 2 d a a cos ϕ t 1 i ϕ t 1 e i m 1 a sin ϕ t 1 1 t 1 2 u n t 1 d t 1 similarly the reflection and the transmission coefficients in the lower fluid layer due to the incident waves of both modes are determined as 3 12 r ν q ν p m 2 n 0 n c n ν 1 1 sin h m 2 h 2 d a a cos ϕ t 1 i ϕ t 1 e i m 2 a sin ϕ t 1 1 t 1 2 u n t 1 d t 1 here p m 1 0 p m 1 1 p m 2 0 q m 1 0 q m 2 0 q m 2 1 and p ν

for this we first notice that the pressure p 2 x y τ at any point x y in the lower fluid region is connected to the velocity potential φ 2 x y τ by the following relation 3 13 p 2 x y τ ρ 2 φ 2 x y τ τ ρ 2 g y r e i ρ 2 g 2 σ 2 φ 2 x y e i σ τ ρ 2 g y therefore the hydrodynamic force in the ν th mode acting on the circular barrier is computed as 3 14 z ν ρ 2 g k r e i γ c ν q 1 d s q 1 at τ 0 ρ 2 g k r e i a θ n 0 n c n ν 1 1 1 t 1 2 u n t 1 d t 1 from the above equation the dimensionless hydrodynamic force in the ν th mode is represented as 3 15 f ν k z ν ρ 2 g a r e iθ n 0 n c n ν 1 1 1 t 1 2 u n t 1 d t 1 4 energy identity relations energy balance relations provide the accuracy of our analytical as well as numerical values for the reflection and the transmission coefficients in a medium consisting of two superposed fluids there exist two energy balance relations using the modified green s second identity to appropriate functions the energy identities involving coefficients r ν r ν r ν and r ν are calculated as 4 1 r ν 2 r ν 2 j r ν 2 r ν 2 z ν ν m 1 m 2 where z m 1 1 z m 2 j and j j m 2 j m 1 with 4 2 j ν i ν d ν 4 1 ε k ρ h 1 0 f 1 ν y 2 d y 0 h 2 cos h ν h 2 y 2 d y ν m 1 m 2 to show the correctness of our numerical values computed here we present the tables 1 and 2 in both the tables the numerical estimates of the reflection and the transmission coefficients are presented for discrete values of k h 1 with d h 1 4 1 5 ε h 1 0 01 γ π 4 δ π 2 d h 1 0 1 h 2 h 1 2 and ρ 0 5 it is clearly observed from both tables that the energy balance relations are satisfied almost accurately 5 numerical results in this section the effect of different parameters such as the arc length of the barrier the depth of their submergence the ice parameters and the depth ratio of the fluids on the reflection coefficient are discussed because our aim is to examine the reflective properties of the circular barrier when a train of waves interacts with circular barrier to check the accuracy of our present analysis in fig 2 we compare our results with those presented in mondal et al 2017 fig 2 describes the reflection coefficient for ρ 1 and h 1 0 in this case the fluid medium consists of only one layer having uniform finite depth h 2 for this situation the graphs with d h 2 0 1 d h 2 4 0 5 ε h 2 0 01 γ π 4 δ π 2 and a h 2 0 5 for the reflection coefficient are obtained by mondal et al 2017 which are plotted in fig 2 by star marks the reflection coefficient calculated from the present analysis is plotted by a solid line from this figure it is visible that the present results agree well with those of mondal et al 2017 next we compare the results for the reflection coefficient with those in mciver and urka 1995 where they considered the scattering of water waves by a circular arc shaped plate submerged in a single layer fluid of deep water taking d a 0 25 d h 2 0 1 d h 2 4 0 ε h 2 0 γ 54 o δ 54 o ρ 1 and h 1 0 the reflection coefficient of the present problem is plotted in fig 3 it is visible from this figure that the present results agree well with those of mciver and urka 1995 to illustrate the effect of the depth of submergence of the circular barrier the reflection coefficients r m 1 and r m 1 are plotted in fig 4 a and b respectively for three different submergence depths d h 1 0 1 0 3 0 5 with γ π 4 δ π 2 d h 1 4 1 5 ε h 1 0 01 h 2 h 1 2 ρ 0 5 it is observed from these two figures that the reflection coefficients increase when the distance of the circular barrier below the undisturbed mean interface decreases this is quite plausible because in this situation the effect of interface wave on the circular barrier increases the role of the arc length of the circular barrier on the reflection coefficients r m 1 and r m 1 is analyzed in figs 5 and 6 in fig 5 a and b the value of γ is kept fixed at γ 45 o and three different values of δ are considered whereas in fig 6 a and b δ is kept fix at δ 90 o and the value of γ is varying for these figures the values of the other parameters are taken as d h 1 0 1 d h 1 4 1 5 ε h 1 0 01 h 2 h 1 2 ρ 0 5 it is noticed from these figures that as the arc length increases the amount of the reflection coefficients increase because a plate with greater arc length puts more resistance in the propagation of waves when a long horizontal circular cylinder is presented in the lower fluid of two superposed fluids where the upper fluid is of finite depth and is covered by a thin layer of ice and the lower fluid is infinitely deep and a train of waves normally interacts upon it das and mandal 2007 obtained zero reflections for any wave number to examine whether such case also happens when the cylinder is presented in the lower fluid of a two layer ice covered fluid where both the layers of the fluid are of uniform finite depth we consider a vertical cross section of a long horizontal circular cylinder therefore the reflection coefficients for the case of an almost full circular barrier γ 45 o δ 404 o are shown in fig 5 a and b it is observed that almost zero reflections occur for any wave number thus the phenomenon of nearly zero reflection also holds very well for the case of a two layer ice covered fluid where both the layers of the fluid are taken to be of uniform finite depth it is noticed from fig 5 that the reflection is maximum when δ 120 o this is because δ 120 o implies a portion of an open cylinder having two edges as the normally incident waves interact with these edges a substantial amount of waves is reflected however as δ increases the barrier tends to occupy the shape of a full circle thus the edge effect becomes less and the incident wave experiences less hindrance so most of the waves are transmitted past the almost full circular cylinder fig 7 a and b demonstrate the effect of the rigidity of the ice cover on the reflection coefficients r m and r m it is noticed from fig 7 a that in the upper layer the reflection coefficient r m 1 decreases with increasing stiffness of the ice cover thus a thicker ice sheet reduces the reflected wave further it is observed in fig 7 b that the reflections in the lower layer are almost the same for various values of the ice cover parameter this is because the ice sheet is above the lower layer and has less effect on the interface wave propagation in fig 8 a and b the reflection coefficients r m 1 and r m 1 are depicted for three different values of the depth ratios h 2 h 1 2 4 10 from these figures it is noticed that in the upper layer the reflection coefficient r m 1 attains the highest peak for h 2 h 1 10 and lowest peak for h 2 h 1 2 however the general pattern of the reflected wave r m 1 is not significantly affected by varying the depth of the lower layer on the other hand when the interface approaches the seabed the reflections in the lower layer increase significantly this happens because as the interface is close to the seabed wave concentration in internal mode increases significantly if the incident wave is of wave number m 2 the reflection coefficients r m 2 and r m 2 are plotted in figs 9 12 for various values of submergence depth of the circular barrier the arc length of the circular barrier and the ice parameters respectively similar nature as noticed in the case of the incident wave of wave number m 1 is also observed in the case of the incident wave of wave number m 2 further it is clear that for the case of the incident wave of wave number m 1 the reflected wave energy in the upper layer is larger as compared with that in the lower layer but in the case of the incident wave of wave number m 2 the reflected wave energy is more in the lower layer compared to that in the upper layer in fig 13 a and b we display the effect of the rigidity of the ice cover on the hydrodynamic forces f m 1 and f m 2 due to incident waves with wave numbers m 1 and m 2 respectively it is observed that for the case of the incident wave of wave number m 1 the circular barrier experiences less hydrodynamics force as the value of the ice cover parameter increases this study might be helpful to protect the coastal area on the other hand in the case of the incident wave of wave number m 2 the circular barrier experiences almost the same hydrodynamic force as the ice cover is approximated by a rigid lid fig 14 a and b depicts the effect of the position of the interface on the hydrodynamic forces f m 1 and f m 2 for different values of h 2 h 1 2 4 10 from fig 14 a it is noticed that the hydrodynamics force f m 2 is not significantly affected by the change in the value of h 2 h 1 however fig 14 b reveals that as the interface is close to the seabed the wave load on the plate increases significantly this is due to the influence of the seabed the hydrodynamic forces f m 1 and f m 2 acting on the circular barrier are presented graphically in fig 15 a and b for the different arc length of the circular barrier it is observed that as the arc length of the circular barrier increases the amount of the hydrodynamic forces increase this is expected because a longer plate will oppose more waves which leads to higher wave load on the circular barrier however it is observed from these figures that for the case of an almost full circular barrier γ 45 o δ 404 o the wave load on the plate decreases 6 conclusion the effect of a floating ice cover on a circular barrier situated in the lower fluid of a stratified fluid medium has been considered the governing boundary value problems have been tackled by reducing them into hypersingular integral equations these equations are solved by an approximate numerical method the solutions are utilized to find the reflection and the transmission coefficients and the wave load acting on the circular barrier and have presented through graphs the conclusions that can be drawn from the presented graphs are 1 reflection coefficients at the upper and lower fluid layer due to incident wave of ν th m 1 m 2 mode decrease as the submergence depth of the plate increases but increase as the arc length of the plate increases 2 almost zero reflection occurs for the case of an almost full circular barrier placed in the lower layer of two layer finite depth water with an ice cover 3 a thicker ice sheet reduces the reflected wave in the upper layer due to incident wave of ν th m 1 m 2 mode however the reflected wave energy in the lower layer remains almost the same 4 the reflected wave energy in the lower layer decreases with the depth ratio whereas in the upper layer it is not significantly affected by the change in the value of h 2 h 1 5 in the surface wave mode the rigidity of the ice sheet reduces the effect of wave load while in the interface wave mode the circular barrier experiences almost the same hydrodynamic force 6 the wave load on the circular barrier in the case of surface mode is not significantly affected by varying the depth of the lower layer however in the case of internal mode when the interface is close to the seabed the wave load on the circular barrier increases significantly in the present analysis we have restricted the plate position within the lower fluid however similar analysis may be employed when the plate is entirely situated in the upper fluid also a somewhat similar approach based on hypersingular integral equation formulation may be employed to deal with a curved plate which penetrates the interface cf islam and gayen 2018 the results obtained in the present manuscript are somewhat new in the context of a two layer fluid and we believe that these may be helpful to marine engineers during construction of curved breakwaters in a stratified fluid authors contribution najnin islam formulated the problem and

21853,with the large progress in tidal current energy the size of tidal current turbine tct rotors has increased leading to more substantial asymmetrical loads in this study severe asymmetrical loads were investigated by a sea trial experiment with a 600 kw two bladed horizontal axis tct individual pitch control ipc has been recommended and validated to be effective for load reductions each blade is individually and actively controlled during ipc to compensate for asymmetrical loads within the rotational cycle ipc has significant engineering implications but may cause partial energy loss under below rated conditions however the conventional ipc method has limitations for two bladed turbines thus to alleviate the fatigue loads of two bladed tcts a new ipc method based on vector analysis is presented in this paper an integral sliding mode controller is designed for the proposed ipc to eliminate the phase lag resulting from the signal filter and actuator to validate the feasibility and investigate the performance of the proposed sliding mode control smc strategy a collaborative simulation using gh bladed and simulink was carried out the comparative simulation results demonstrated

tidal current turbine smc sliding mode control ipc individual pitch control bem blade element momentum psd power spectral density 1 introduction tidal current energy is a new type of renewable energy harvested from the kinetic energy of the tidal current the exploitation of tidal current energy has experienced large development and progress over the past twenty years zhou et al 2017 the horizontal axis turbine has become the main choice for large tidal current turbines tcts however with the increase in tct size the fatigue loads arising from current shear and turbulence pose more serious threats to the fatigue lifetime of the tct individual pitch control ipc techniques have been proposed to alleviate the overall harmful asymmetrical fatigue loads of wind rotors bossanyi 2003 significant load reductions for wind turbines using ipc have been validated both in simulations and field tests bossanyi et al 2013 this technique is presumably also effective for tcts as they follow principles similar to those of wind turbines wts although tcts follow principles similar to those of wts they still have some significant differences first tcts have smaller rotational inertia because of the shorter blades due to the larger power density of the tidal current typically the inertia of a 750 kw wind turbine referring to the low speed shaft is approximately 998139 kg m2 mandic et al 2012 while the inertia of a 600 kw tidal current turbine is only approximately 30150 kg m2 thus the asymmetrical loads not only caused fatigue damage but also have an important contribution to the rotation fluctuation this causes safety issues for tcts and has a negative effect on power quality second tcts have a larger loads than wts with the same capacity as the tidal current velocity is much slower than the wind velocity winter 2011 finally the sea state is more complex than the wind state with confronting waves turbulence flow and passing vessels de jesus henriques et al 2014 lewis et al 2014 milne et al 2015 tcts also suffer from severe current shear and turbulence as tcts are often located in coastal sea areas many tct companies have experienced blade failure including mct openhydro atlantis and verdant power bahaj 2011 winter 2011 zhou et al 2017 therefore the need for load reductions of tcts is increasingly urgent both under the above rated and below rated operation conditions meanwhile the high energy cost of tcts is one of the main restraining factors for its commercial development li et al 2011 one effective way to reduce the energy cost of tcts is adopting a two bladed rotor which has a distinct cost advantage in manufacturing transport and offshore installation in addition a low solidity rotor may have a higher rotor speed for maximum energy tracking which reduces the gearbox torque requirement duquette and visser 2003 however the two bladed rotor may suffer much severer asymmetrical fatigue loads than the three bladed rotor kim et al 2015 which restrains its practical application hence reliable and efficient load reduction is particularly significant for the development of two bladed tcts however due to the higher rotor speed the pitching rate and pitching controller of the two bladed turbines may have higher requirements however the individual pitch control is mainly studied for three bladed wind turbines while relative studies on ameliorating the asymmetrical loads of tcts especially for two bladed tcts have seldom been carried out multi blade coordinate transformation is widely used for the multivariable coupling problem in ipc for three bladed wts transforming measured blade loads in a rotating frame to those in a fixed frame in the yaw and tilt directions however the transformation matrix for the two bladed rotor is singular and irreversible therefore the decoupling condition is no longer satisfied riboldi and cacciola 2017 van solingen and van wingerden 2015 there are a number of recent studies on ipc controller design and optimization in conventional ipc pi controllers with a simple filter based on multi blade coordinate transformation coleman transformation are widely used bossanyi 2005 applying fuzzy logic control for the pi controller can improve its dynamic performance civelek et al 2017 however the phase lag due to the signal filter communication interval and signal processing leads to obvious control deviations adding a differential part is helpful for phase lag but it may magnify signal fluctuation and result in possible safety vibration danger hence linear quadratic gaussian lqg multivariable controllers were proposed using the kalman filter for the estimation of the system state bossanyi 2003 nourdine et al 2011 selvam et al 2009 however possible model errors and high computational requirements limit its practical application bossanyi 2003 other advanced intelligent control strategies have been studied for ipc with commendable load reduction in simulations but these strategies usually need stronger computing ability or accurate measurement thus their practical applications to actual tct controllers are complex navalkar et al 2014 another effective method to compensate for the phase lag of the three bladed turbine is including an azimuth offset in the reverse transformation which may not be applicable due to the singular transformation matrix mulders et al 2019 van solingen et al 2016 in this paper the fatigue loads of a two bladed 600 kw horizontal axis tct are analysed through experimental data in the real sea state and a reproduction simulation via gh bladed the conventional ipc method is introduced and its limitations for two bladed tcts are analysed then a new but simple ipc method is proposed based on the blade moment vector analysis aimed at alleviating the phase lag a simple integral sliding mode controller with high feasibility and strong robustness for a two bladed individual pitch system is designed to validate the feasibilities of the proposed ipc method and the designed controller a comparative collaborative simulation is carried out and shows promising results 2 source of the problem a two bladed 600 kw horizontal axis tct see fig 1 developed by zhejiang university had its sea trial around the zhoushan sea area the 10 min experimental data are plotted in fig 2 li et al 2019 severe generator speed fluctuations are clearly observed in fig 2 as expected to determine the reasons for the generator speed fluctuation a power spectral density psd analysis for the current velocity and generator speed was conducted as displayed in fig 3 the psd results display three spectrum peaks the two later high frequency spectrum peaks agree with the 2p twice per revolution and 4p frequencies of the rotor speed 11 1 rpm the gearing ratio between generator and rotor is 15 psd results indicate that the fast rotation speed fluctuation is possibly caused by fatigue loads due to the current shear and turbulence according to the measured tidal velocity the horizontal velocity difference at the experiment site is very small the turbulence may have a relatively lower contribution to fatigue loads compared with current shear thus the vertical current shear is acknowledged as the main source of fatigue loads in this paper severe fatigue loads could pose a threat to the components of tcts and increase both the manufacture and maintenance costs meanwhile fast fluctuating power has an obvious negative effect on the power quality and the fluctuating rotation speed is a challenge for turbine safety and stability thus load reduction and consequent power smoothing are necessary for a large scale grid connected tct ipc is a recommendable approach to reduce the severe fatigue loads of tcts to estimate the amplitude of the fatigue load and current shear coefficient for the simulation study a reproduction simulation via gh bladed which is a professional commercial software based on blade element momentum bem theory was carried out the parameters of the 600 kw horizontal axis tct li et al 2019 were directly defined in gh bladed jia et al 2017 kim et al 2013 the current velocity was defined based on the average power production of experimental results and the current shear coefficient was chosen based on the power and rotation speed fluctuation in this way the similar stream conditions to those in fig 2 were obtained and the reproduction results in gh bladed are plotted in fig 4 and fig 5 the fatigue loads calculated in gh bladed are displayed in fig 6 the simulation results indicate that the amplitude of the 2p twice per revolution load in fixed hub frame namely the 1p load in rotational blade frame is approximately 150 knm when the generator power is approximately 1 3 of the rated power 3 load analysis and individual pitch control method 3 1 load analysis based on bem theory in this section the fatigue loads are investigated based on bem theory bem theory divides the blade into a number of transversal elements along the blade the load of a tct can be calculated from the accumulation of all loads of the blade elements burton et al 2011 a selected element of the blade with chord c situated at r is shown in fig 7 according to the actuator disc theory the axial current velocity at the element can be described as 1 u d u 1 a where a is the axial induction factor and u is the free current velocity the tangential velocity relative to the blade element is 2 u t ω r 1 a where a is the tangential induction factor and ω is the rotor speed the relationship between the velocity and force at a selected blade element is shown in fig 7 the hydrofoil relative current velocity at the local blade element can be described as 3 v u 2 1 a 2 ω 2 r 2 1 a 2 where φ is the angle between v and the rotation surface and β is the pitch angle and the attack angle is defined as 4 α φ β the lift force δl and drag force δd acting on the blade element are 5 δ d 1 2 ρ c v 2 c d α δ r 6 δ l 1 2 ρ c v 2 c l α δ r where cl is the lift force coefficient cd is the drag force coefficient and c is the chord a stationary hub coordinate system and a rotational blade coordinate system are established as shown in fig 7 thus the load of a blade in a rotational coordinate system can be calculated by load accumulation of every blade element and can be described as dai et al 2011 7 δ f y b δ l s i n φ

asymmetry myb of two blades produces the fatigue load 3 2 individual pitch control for a two blade tct 3 2 1 conventional ipc and its limitation for two bladed turbines the harmful fatigue load of a rotor can be decomposed in the tilt and yaw directions a traditional ipc strategy with a rotor with b blades is shown in fig 8 as both the tilt and yaw moments are affected by the pitch angle of each blade load reduction control by the conventional ipc strategy demands decoupling by multi blade coordinates multi blade coordinate decoupling is based on the local linearization of every blade load the moment of every blade can be expressed as jelavic et al 2008 11 δ m 1 δ m 2 δ m 3 δ m b k 1 0 0 0 0 k 2 0 0 0 0 k 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 k b δ β 1 δ β 2 δ β 3 δ β b h 1 0 0 0 0 h 2 0 0 0 0 h 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 h b δ v 1 δ v 2 δ v 3 δ v b where k i m i β i h i m i v i and v i is the equivalent tidal velocity at each blade the tilt and yaw direction load components can be written as 12 δ m t i l t δ m y a w q

3 π b cos θ b 1 π b s i n θ sin θ 2 π b sin θ 2 π b sin θ b 1 π b where θ is the azimuth angle the tilt moment mtilt and moment yaw myaw are controlled by the controller and δβtilt and δβyaw are outputted βtilt and βyaw are the mathematical equivalent pitch angles at two orthogonal nonrotating axes that coincide with the x and y axes in the stationary hub coordinate system respectively the reverse transform can be expressed as 14 δ β 1 δ β 2 δ β 3 δ β b q t δ β t i l t δ β y a w the physical implication of eq 14 is that the resultant vector composed of δβtilt and δβyaw is decomposed in all directions this means that the output values δβtilt and δβyaw are realized by every single blade pitch actuator thus the tilt and yaw moments can be written as 15 δ m t i l t δ m y a w q δ m 1 δ m

decoupling it is necessary to assume that k1 k2 k3 k based on this assumption 16 q k 1 0 0 0 0 k 2 0 0 0 0 k 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 k b q t b 2 k 0 0 k the linear expression can be written as 17 δ m t i l t δ

transform matrix q of a two bladed rotor is singular hence eq 16 and the linearly decoupled eq 17 are no longer satisfied this limitation can also be considered from the perspective of vector decomposition the resultant vector composed of the acquired values δβtilt and δβyaw cannot be fully represented by the linear combination of two independent vectors δβ1 and δβ2 thus the output control signals δβtilt and δβyaw cannot be fully implemented by a two bladed pitching actuator 3 2 2 ipc for a two bladed turbine novel ipc for a two bladed turbine is proposed based on vector analysis the blade moment diagram for a two bladed turbine is shown in fig 9 m1 and m2 are not two independent vector in opposite directions and their resultant moment can be easily expressed as 18 m r m 1 m 2 because m1 and m2 have opposite directions the numerical value of mr is the difference in their magnitudes thus the tilt and yaw components of the resultant moment can be written as 19 m t i l t m y a w m 1 m 2 c o s θ m 1 m 2 s i n θ m r c o s θ m r s i n θ therefore the resultant moment can be controlled directly to reduce the fatigue load the linear expression of the resultant moment can be written as jelavic et al 2008 20 δ m r k 1 δ β 1 k 2 δ β 2 h 1 δ v 1 h 2 δ v 2 in other words the load reduction for a two bladed rotor can be implemented by the pitch control of any single blade under the assumption of k1 k2 k the equation can be expressed as 21 δ m r k δ β 1 δ β 2 h 1 δ v 1 h 2 δ v 2 because of the symmetrical characteristic the pitch angles can be assumed to satisfy 22 δ β 1 δ β 2 c o n s t a n t 2 δ β 0 where β0 is the demanded collective pitch angle and constant is the pitch angle offset to avoid the negative pitch angle based on the symmetrical relationship the control schematic is shown in fig 10 4 control strategy design similar to wts the tidal current shear namely the current velocity gradient in the vertical direction results from fluid viscosity and friction with the seabed see fig 11 the relationship between current velocity and height can be described as shen et al 2011 23 v h v h h u b h h h u b γ h 0 h 0 where h hub is the height of hub v h hub is the free current velocity at hub and γ is the shear coefficient and is estimated in the previous reproduction simulation in section 2 according to the equation the current velocity along the blade can be described as dolan and lehn 2006 24 v r v h h u b h h u b r c o s θ h h u b γ applying the taylor expansion to the equation 25 v r v h h u b 1 γ r c o s θ h h u b γ γ 1 2 r c o s θ h h u b 2 γ γ 2 3 r c o s θ h h u b 3 hence the free current velocity at every blade element can be regarded as the combination of a steady velocity and periodic velocities with frequencies of 1p 2p 3p etc therefore the frequencies of the consequent load in the rotational blade coordinate system are also 1p 2p 3p etc the moment can be described as 26 m r t m t 0 t m t 1 t c o s θ m t 2 t c o s 2 θ m t 3 t c o s 3 θ where m ti represents the amplitudes of various harmonic loads as the 1p load is the main source of fatigue load the 1p load is regarded as a known disturbance value and is considered in the smc design let y m r m 1 m 2 and then the resultant load can be described as 27 y k β q m t 1 c o s θ f t where 28 β q β 1 β 2 and f t is the model error the pitch system can be described by equation mulders et al 2019 29 β q t β q t u to eliminate the potential large steady state error the state variables are defined as 30 x 1 y y r e f 31 x 2 y y r e f d t where the control target yref 0 and thus x 1 m 1 m 2 using eqs 29 and 30 the time derivatives of state variables can be given as 32 x 1 k t β q k t u ω m t 1 s i n θ f t 33 x 2 x 1 a first order integral sliding mode surface is designed as 34 z x 1 c 1 x 2 c1 represents the sliding mode coefficient thus when the system moves on the sliding mode surface namely z 0 the time derivative x 1 c 1 x 2 this means that x 1 can approach zero within the limited time if c 1 0 the dynamic characteristics of the system moving on the sliding mode can be designed by selecting proper c 1 considering the system motion outside the sliding mode surface the time derivative of eq 35 is 35 z k t β q k t u m t 1 ω s i n θ f c 1 x 1 to design how the system move to the sliding mode surface the reaching law can be formulated by setting the time derivative of eq 36 as yin et al 2015 36 z ε s g n z h e z f where ε f m a x for lyapunov s stability condition and the sliding line reaching condition z z 0 h e is the exponential reaching coefficient the potential sliding mode chatter resulting from the nonlinear sign function and control hysteresis may produce serious mechanical damage to the turbine and pitch actuator additionally the high frequency chatter may be intensified due to a large value of ε thus continuous saturation functions are proposed to replace the sign functions as plotted in fig 12 to eliminate the chatter problem and to realize the control algorithm easily in an actual tct controller a smoother arctan function is used in this paper and the control law is redesigned as 37 z ε 2 π a r c t a n z k h e z f where k is the slope factor for eliminating chatter substituting eq 38 into eq 36 yields 38 u β q ω m t 1 k t s i n θ c 1 x 1 k t 1 k t ε 2 π a r c t a n z k h e z the control law in eq 39 can be divided into two parts equivalent control ua and switch control us where 39 u a β q ω m t 1 k t s i n θ c 1 x 1 k t and 40 u s 1 k t ε 2 π a r c t a n z k h e z the equivalent control is aimed at keeping the system at the sliding mode surface while the switch control is aimed at approaching the sliding mode surface the input value of the equivalent control does not require a filter and thus the phase lag can always be ignored the switch control provides the system with strong robustness to the modelling error and disturbance meanwhile eq 39 indicates that the ideal sliding mode control demands accurate values of m t1 and k however they are not constant and are difficult to obtain under various conditions therefore the values of m t1 and k acquired by the load prediction using the bem code under a rated condition are recommended to be substituted as constant parameters gu et al 2018 liu et al 2016 in addition the current shear is related to the geographical location of the tct and is regarded as roughly constant over time due to the high stability and regularity of tidal current energy liu et al 2011 as the designed control strategy has strong robustness and the fatigue load is demanded to be reduced rather than to be completely eliminated the modelling error has little impact on the control result 5 simulation and discussion to validate the load reduction of the proposed ipc a collaborative simulation was conducted the 600 kw tidal current turbine was defined in gh bladed which is a professional commercial integrated software package for turbine performance and loading calculations the controller was built in matlab simulink due to its visual model design and excellent data processing capability the external controller of gh bladed aims for a complex control strategy designed by users however the commercial software gh bladed lacks the available communication interface with matlab simulink which is required to establish a collaborative simulation this paper uses c to build a tcp communication interface based on sockets the simulation interface schematic is shown in fig 13 the tcp server is established in the external controller in c and the tcp client is established in the s function in simulink after socket configuration in the external controller the server begins to listen and block until the client asks for a connection then the server sends turbine information to the simulink controller such as generator speed load rotor azimuth angle and current pitch angle this information is processed in simulink and the controller sends the demanded pitch angles and torque to gh bladed the communication interval is set as 10 ms which is consistent with the actual controller of the tct the discrete ipc controllers are built using smc and pi controls in simulink as shown in fig 14 and fig 15 respectively as the rotor speed increases the large phase lag due to the low pass filter pitch actuator and communication interval can no longer be ignored and has a serious negative impact on the control effect thus a phase lead compensator is added before the pi controller 41 e z z 0 9959 z 0 9433 according to the rated tidal velocity of the 600 kw tct 2 5 m s the simulations were conducted under below rated conditions and above rated conditions to investigate the performances of the proposed ipc controllers under various operating conditions the simulation results are plotted from fig 16 to fig 23 the fatigue loads in frequency domain are plotted in logarithmic coordinates as illustrated in fig 16 the power fluctuation under the below rated condition is alleviated by ipc at the cost of power efficiency meanwhile ipc smooths the rotor speed fluctuation and thus help improve the system stability and reliability two control strategies do not exhibit visible differences at their ability to smooth the power and rotor speed fluctuation at the same time fig 20 displays that power becomes smooth when the collective pitch control comes into operation under the above rated conditions this indicates that the engineering significance of power smoothing by ipc mainly occurs under below rated operating conditions the 1p load peak amplitudes in rotational rotor frame of the simulation results are listed in table 1 and demonstrate that compared with the loads without ipc both ipc control strategies have a significant load reduction effect under various operating conditions while the smc has better performance compared with the conventional pi controller the simulation results verify the feasibility of the proposed ipc scheme as indicated in figs 17 and 21 the smc controller responds faster to the regular load change and is more sensitive to small load variations thus the smc controller represents good load reduction performance in full frequency range especially in above rated condition as illustrated in fig 22 and fig 23 nonetheless the conventional pi controller has a distinct advantage in its fewer requirements for sensor numbers in consideration of the fatigue limit the pi controller still has important potential engineering significance besides the load measurement is necessary for both ipc strategies and indirect load measurement can be taken into consideration for load feedback li et al 2020 6 conclusion the severe asymmetrical load of a two bladed 600 kw horizontal axis tct is investigated by sea trial experiments and reproduction simulations as the application of the conventional ipc method has limitations for two bladed turbines a new ipc load reduction method is presented based on blade moment vector analysis in addition a controller using the integral sliding mode control strategy for the two bladed horizontal axis tct is designed for the proposed ipc method the nonlinear switch function is replaced by a linear equivalent function to effectively eliminate sliding mode chatter to validate the feasibility and investigate the performance of the proposed ipc controller a comparative collaborative simulation was carried out using gh bladed and simulink the results demonstrated that the proposed integral smc controller has better performance in fatigue load reduction compared with a conventional pi controller from a practical perspective the proposed ipc strategy is relatively simple and is easy to implement in the actual tct control system without requiring complex calculations and control parameter adjustments this study may give researchers and engineers confidence regarding two bladed tct development in the context of asymmetrical load reduction the design margins of the tct components may be further reduced and two bladed tcts may become more advantageous in terms of energy cost additionally there is a trade off between energy production and fatigue load reduction below rated conditions which can be further studied and evaluated by tct developers however practical applications of individual pitch control for tcts are still in the research stage the implementation of ipc hardware in the cramped space of a hub and its dynamic seal may be two main challenges therefore future studies will include the development of a physical implementation for large scale tidal current velocity including an adaptive algorithm and load estimator will also be considered to improve the smc controller author contribution yangjian li

21853,with the large progress in tidal current energy the size of tidal current turbine tct rotors has increased leading to more substantial asymmetrical loads in this study severe asymmetrical loads were investigated by a sea trial experiment with a 600 kw two bladed horizontal axis tct individual pitch control ipc has been recommended and validated to be effective for load reductions each blade is individually and actively controlled during ipc to compensate for asymmetrical loads within the rotational cycle ipc has significant engineering implications but may cause partial energy loss under below rated conditions however the conventional ipc method has limitations for two bladed turbines thus to alleviate the fatigue loads of two bladed tcts a new ipc method based on vector analysis is presented in this paper an integral sliding mode controller is designed for the proposed ipc to eliminate the phase lag resulting from the signal filter and actuator to validate the feasibility and investigate the performance of the proposed sliding mode control smc strategy a collaborative simulation using gh bladed and simulink was carried out the comparative simulation results demonstrated

harvested from the kinetic energy of the tidal current the exploitation of tidal current energy has experienced large development and progress over the past twenty years zhou et al 2017 the horizontal axis turbine has become the main choice for large tidal current turbines tcts however with the increase in tct size the fatigue loads arising from current shear and turbulence pose more serious threats to the fatigue lifetime of the tct individual pitch control ipc techniques have been proposed to alleviate the overall harmful asymmetrical fatigue loads of wind rotors bossanyi 2003 significant load reductions for wind turbines using ipc have been validated both in simulations and field tests bossanyi et al 2013 this technique is presumably also effective for tcts as they follow principles similar to those of wind turbines wts although tcts follow principles similar to those of wts they still have some significant differences first tcts have smaller rotational inertia because of the shorter blades due to the larger power density of the tidal current typically the inertia of a 750 kw wind turbine referring to the low speed shaft is approximately 998139 kg m2 mandic et al 2012 while the inertia of a 600 kw tidal current turbine is only approximately 30150 kg m2 thus the asymmetrical loads not only caused fatigue damage but also have an important contribution to the rotation fluctuation this causes safety issues for tcts and has a negative effect on power quality second tcts have a larger loads than wts with the same capacity as the tidal current velocity is much slower than the wind velocity winter 2011 finally the sea state is more complex than the wind state with confronting waves turbulence flow and passing vessels de jesus henriques et al 2014 lewis et al 2014 milne et al 2015 tcts also suffer from severe current shear and turbulence as tcts are often located in coastal sea areas many tct companies have experienced blade failure including mct openhydro atlantis and verdant power bahaj 2011 winter 2011 zhou et al 2017 therefore the need for load reductions of tcts is increasingly urgent both under the above rated and below rated operation conditions meanwhile the high energy cost of tcts is one of the main restraining factors for its commercial development li et al 2011 one effective way to reduce the energy cost of tcts is adopting a two bladed rotor which has a distinct cost advantage in manufacturing transport and offshore installation in addition a low solidity rotor may have a higher rotor speed for maximum energy tracking which reduces the gearbox torque requirement duquette and visser 2003 however the two bladed rotor may suffer much severer asymmetrical fatigue loads than the three bladed rotor kim et al 2015 which restrains its practical application hence reliable and efficient load reduction is particularly significant for the development of two bladed tcts however due to the higher rotor speed the pitching rate and pitching controller of the two bladed turbines may have higher requirements however the individual pitch control is mainly studied for three bladed wind turbines while relative studies on ameliorating the asymmetrical loads of tcts especially for two bladed tcts have seldom been carried out multi blade coordinate transformation is widely used for the multivariable coupling problem in ipc for three bladed wts transforming measured blade loads in a rotating frame to those in a fixed frame in the yaw and tilt directions however the transformation matrix for the two bladed rotor is singular and irreversible therefore the decoupling condition is no longer satisfied riboldi and cacciola 2017 van solingen and van wingerden 2015 there are a number of recent studies on ipc controller design and optimization in conventional ipc pi controllers with a simple filter based on multi blade coordinate transformation coleman transformation are widely used bossanyi 2005 applying fuzzy logic control for the pi controller can improve its dynamic performance civelek et al 2017 however the phase lag due to the signal filter communication interval and signal processing leads to obvious control deviations adding a differential part is helpful for phase lag but it may magnify signal fluctuation and result in possible safety vibration danger hence linear quadratic gaussian lqg multivariable controllers were proposed using the kalman filter for the estimation of the system state bossanyi 2003 nourdine et al 2011 selvam et al 2009 however possible model errors and high computational requirements limit its practical application bossanyi 2003 other advanced intelligent control strategies have been studied for ipc with commendable load reduction in simulations but these strategies usually need stronger computing ability or accurate measurement thus their practical applications to actual tct controllers are complex navalkar et al 2014 another effective method to compensate for the phase lag of the three bladed turbine is including an azimuth offset in the reverse transformation which may not be applicable due to the singular transformation matrix mulders et al 2019 van solingen et al 2016 in this paper the fatigue loads of a two bladed 600 kw horizontal axis tct are analysed through experimental data in the real sea state and a reproduction simulation via gh bladed the conventional ipc method is introduced and its limitations for two bladed tcts are analysed then a new but simple ipc method is proposed based on the blade moment vector analysis aimed at alleviating the phase lag a simple integral sliding mode controller with high feasibility and strong robustness for a two bladed individual pitch system is designed to validate the feasibilities of the proposed ipc method and the designed controller a comparative collaborative simulation is carried out and shows promising results 2 source of the problem a two bladed 600 kw horizontal axis tct see fig 1 developed by zhejiang university had its sea trial around the zhoushan sea area the 10 min experimental data are plotted in fig 2 li et al 2019 severe generator speed fluctuations are clearly observed in fig 2 as expected to determine the reasons for the generator speed fluctuation a power spectral density psd analysis for the current velocity and generator speed was conducted as displayed in fig 3 the psd results display three spectrum peaks the two later high frequency spectrum peaks agree with the 2p twice per revolution and 4p frequencies of the rotor speed 11 1 rpm the gearing ratio between generator and rotor is 15 psd results indicate that the fast rotation speed fluctuation is possibly caused by fatigue loads due to the current shear and turbulence according to the measured tidal velocity the horizontal velocity difference at the experiment site is very small the turbulence may have a relatively lower contribution to fatigue loads compared with current shear thus the vertical current shear is acknowledged as the main source of fatigue loads in this paper severe fatigue loads could pose a threat to the components of tcts and increase both the manufacture and maintenance costs meanwhile fast fluctuating power has an obvious negative effect on the power quality and the fluctuating rotation speed is a challenge for turbine safety and stability thus load reduction and consequent power smoothing are necessary for a large scale grid connected tct ipc is a recommendable approach to reduce the severe fatigue loads of tcts to estimate the amplitude of the fatigue load and current shear coefficient for the simulation study a reproduction simulation via gh bladed which is a professional commercial software based on blade element momentum bem theory was carried out the parameters of the 600 kw horizontal axis tct li et al 2019 were directly defined in gh bladed jia et al 2017 kim et al 2013 the current velocity was defined based on the average power production of experimental results and the current shear coefficient was chosen based on the power and rotation speed fluctuation in this way the similar stream conditions to those in fig 2 were obtained and the reproduction results in gh bladed are plotted in fig 4 and fig 5 the fatigue loads calculated in gh bladed are displayed in fig 6 the simulation results indicate that the amplitude of the 2p twice per revolution load in fixed hub frame namely the 1p load in rotational blade frame is approximately 150 knm when the generator power is approximately 1 3 of the rated power 3 load analysis and individual pitch control method 3 1 load analysis based on bem theory in this section the fatigue loads are investigated based on bem theory bem theory divides the blade into a number of transversal elements along the blade the load of a tct can be calculated from the accumulation of all loads of the blade elements burton et al 2011 a selected element of the blade with chord c situated at r is shown in fig 7 according to the actuator disc theory the axial current velocity at the element can be described as 1 u d u 1 a where a is the axial induction factor and u is the free current velocity the tangential velocity relative to the blade element is 2 u t ω r 1 a where a is the tangential induction factor and ω is the rotor speed the relationship between the velocity and force at a selected blade element is shown in fig 7 the hydrofoil relative current velocity at the local blade element can be described as 3 v u 2 1 a 2 ω 2 r 2 1 a 2 where φ is the angle between v and the rotation surface and β is the pitch angle and the attack angle is defined as 4 α φ β the lift force δl and drag force δd acting on the blade element are 5 δ d 1 2 ρ c v 2 c d α δ r 6 δ l 1 2 ρ c v 2 c l α δ r where cl is the lift force coefficient cd is the drag force coefficient and c is the chord a stationary hub coordinate system and a rotational blade coordinate system are established as shown in fig 7 thus the load of a blade in a rotational coordinate system can be calculated by load accumulation of every blade element and can be described as dai et al 2011 7 δ f y b δ l s i n φ

asymmetry myb of two blades produces the fatigue load 3 2 individual pitch control for a two blade tct 3 2 1 conventional ipc and its limitation for two bladed turbines the harmful fatigue load of a rotor can be decomposed in the tilt and yaw directions a traditional ipc strategy with a rotor with b blades is shown in fig 8 as both the tilt and yaw moments are affected by the pitch angle of each blade load reduction control by the conventional ipc strategy demands decoupling by multi blade coordinates multi blade coordinate decoupling is based on the local linearization of every blade load the moment of every blade can be expressed as jelavic et al 2008 11 δ m 1 δ m 2 δ m 3 δ m b k 1 0 0 0 0 k 2 0 0 0 0 k 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 k b δ β 1 δ β 2 δ β 3 δ β b h 1 0 0 0 0 h 2 0 0 0 0 h 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 h b δ v 1 δ v 2 δ v 3 δ v b where k i m i β i h i m i v i and v i is the equivalent tidal velocity at each blade the tilt and yaw direction load components can be written as 12 δ m t i l t δ m y a w q δ m 1 δ m 2 δ m 3 δ m b q k 1 0 0 0 0 k 2 0 0 0 0 k 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 k b δ β 1 δ β 2 δ β 3 δ β b q h 1 0 0 0 0 h 2 0 0 0 0 h 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 h b δ v 1 δ v 2 δ v 3 δ v b where 13 q c o s θ cos θ 2 π b cos θ 3 π b cos θ b 1 π b s i n θ sin θ 2 π b sin θ 2 π b sin θ b 1 π b where θ is the azimuth angle the tilt moment mtilt and moment yaw myaw are controlled by the controller and δβtilt and δβyaw are outputted βtilt and βyaw are the mathematical equivalent pitch angles at two orthogonal nonrotating axes that coincide with the x and y axes in the stationary hub coordinate system respectively the reverse transform can be expressed as 14 δ β 1 δ β 2 δ β 3 δ β b q t δ β t i l t δ β y a w the physical implication of eq 14 is that the resultant vector composed of δβtilt and δβyaw is decomposed in all directions this means that the output values δβtilt and δβyaw are realized by every single blade pitch actuator thus the tilt and yaw moments can be written as 15 δ m t i l t δ m y a w q δ m 1 δ m 2 δ m 3 δ m b q k 1 0 0 0 0 k 2 0 0 0 0 k 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 k b q t δ β t i l t δ β y a w q h 1 0 0 0 0 h 2 0 0 0 0 h 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 h b δ v 1 δ v 2 δ v 3 δ v b although few studies state the assumption of decoupling it is necessary to assume that k1 k2 k3 k based on this assumption 16 q k 1 0 0 0 0 k 2 0 0 0 0 k 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 k b q t b 2 k 0 0 k the linear expression can be written as 17 δ m t i l t δ

transform matrix q of a two bladed rotor is singular hence eq 16 and the linearly decoupled eq 17 are no longer satisfied this limitation can also be considered from the perspective of vector decomposition the resultant vector composed of the acquired values δβtilt and δβyaw cannot be fully represented by the linear combination of two independent vectors δβ1 and δβ2 thus the output control signals δβtilt and δβyaw cannot be fully implemented by a two bladed pitching actuator 3 2 2 ipc for a two bladed turbine novel ipc for a two bladed turbine is proposed based on vector analysis the blade moment diagram for a two bladed turbine is shown in fig 9 m1 and m2 are not two independent vector in opposite directions and their resultant moment can be easily expressed as 18 m r m 1 m 2 because m1 and m2 have opposite directions the numerical value of mr is the difference in their magnitudes thus the tilt and yaw components of the resultant moment can be written as 19 m t i l t m y a w m 1 m 2 c o s θ m 1 m 2 s i n θ m r c o s θ m r s i n θ therefore the resultant moment can be controlled directly to reduce the fatigue load the linear expression of the resultant moment can be written as jelavic et al 2008 20 δ m r k 1 δ β 1 k 2 δ β 2 h 1 δ v 1 h 2 δ v 2 in other words the load reduction for a two bladed rotor can be implemented by the pitch control of any single blade under the assumption of k1 k2 k the equation can be expressed as 21 δ m r k δ β 1 δ β 2 h 1 δ v 1 h 2 δ v 2 because of the symmetrical characteristic the pitch angles can be assumed to satisfy 22 δ β 1 δ β 2 c o n s t a n t 2 δ β 0 where β0 is the demanded collective pitch angle and constant is the pitch angle offset to avoid the negative pitch angle based on the symmetrical relationship the control schematic is shown in fig 10 4 control strategy design similar to wts the tidal current shear namely the current velocity gradient in the vertical direction results from fluid viscosity and friction with the seabed see fig 11 the relationship between current velocity and height can be described as shen et al 2011 23 v h v h h u b h h h u b γ h 0 h 0 where h hub is the height of hub v h hub is the free current velocity at hub and γ is the shear coefficient and is estimated in the previous reproduction simulation in section 2 according to the equation the current velocity along the blade can be described as dolan and lehn 2006 24 v r v h h u b h h u b r c o s θ h h u b γ applying the taylor expansion to the equation 25 v r v h h u b 1 γ r c o s θ h h u b γ γ 1 2 r c o s θ h h u b 2 γ γ 2 3 r c o s θ h h u b 3 hence the free current velocity at every blade element can be regarded as the combination of a steady velocity and periodic velocities with frequencies of 1p 2p 3p etc therefore the frequencies of the consequent load in the rotational blade coordinate system are also 1p 2p 3p etc the moment can be described as 26 m r t m t 0 t m t 1 t c o s θ m t 2 t c o s 2 θ m t 3 t c o s 3 θ where m ti represents the amplitudes of various harmonic loads as the 1p load is the main source of fatigue load the 1p load is regarded as a known disturbance value and is considered in the smc design let y m r m 1 m 2 and then the resultant load can be described as 27 y k β q m t 1 c o s θ f t where 28 β q β 1 β 2 and f t is the model error the pitch system can be described by equation mulders et al 2019 29 β q t β q t u to eliminate the potential large steady state error the state variables are defined as 30 x 1 y y r e f 31 x 2 y y r e f d t where the control target yref 0 and thus x 1 m 1 m 2 using eqs 29 and 30 the time derivatives of state variables can be given as 32 x 1 k t β q k t u ω m t 1 s i n θ f t 33 x 2 x 1 a first order integral sliding mode surface is designed as 34 z x 1 c 1 x 2 c1 represents the sliding mode coefficient thus when the system moves on the sliding mode surface namely z 0 the time derivative x 1 c 1 x 2 this means that x 1 can approach zero within the limited time if c 1 0 the dynamic characteristics of the system moving on the sliding mode can be designed by selecting proper c 1 considering the system motion outside the sliding mode surface the time derivative of eq 35 is 35 z k t β q k t u m t 1 ω s i n θ f c 1 x 1 to design how the system move to the sliding mode surface the reaching law can be formulated by setting the time derivative of eq 36 as yin et al 2015 36 z ε s g n z h e z f where ε f m a x for lyapunov s stability condition and the sliding line reaching condition z z 0 h e is the exponential reaching coefficient the potential sliding mode chatter resulting from the nonlinear sign function and control hysteresis may produce serious mechanical damage to the turbine and pitch actuator additionally the high frequency chatter may be intensified due to a large value of ε thus continuous saturation functions are proposed to replace the sign functions as plotted in fig 12 to eliminate the chatter problem and to realize the control algorithm easily in an actual tct controller a smoother arctan function is used in this paper and the control law is redesigned as 37 z ε 2 π a r c t a n z k h e z f where k is the slope factor for eliminating chatter substituting eq 38 into eq 36 yields 38 u β q ω m t 1 k t s i n θ c 1 x 1 k t 1 k t ε 2 π a r c t a n z k h e z the control law in eq 39 can be divided into two parts equivalent control ua and switch control us where 39 u a β q ω m t 1 k t s i n θ c 1 x 1 k t and 40 u s 1 k t ε 2 π a r c t a n z k h e z the equivalent control is aimed at keeping the system at the sliding mode surface while the switch control is aimed at approaching the sliding mode surface the input value of the equivalent control does not require a filter and thus the phase lag can always be ignored the switch control provides the system with strong robustness to the modelling error and disturbance meanwhile eq 39 indicates that the ideal sliding mode control demands accurate values of m t1 and k however they are not constant and are difficult to obtain under various conditions therefore the values of m t1 and k acquired by the load prediction using the bem code under a rated condition are recommended to be substituted as constant parameters gu et al 2018 liu et al 2016 in addition the current shear is related to the geographical location of the tct and is regarded as roughly constant over time due to the high stability and regularity of tidal current energy liu et al 2011 as the designed control strategy has strong robustness and the fatigue load is demanded to be reduced rather than to be completely eliminated the modelling error has little impact on the control result 5 simulation and discussion to validate the load reduction of the proposed ipc a collaborative simulation was conducted the 600 kw tidal current turbine was defined in gh bladed which is a professional commercial integrated software package for turbine performance and loading calculations the controller was built in matlab simulink due to its visual model design and excellent data processing capability the external controller of gh bladed aims for a complex control strategy designed by users however the commercial software gh bladed lacks the available communication interface with matlab simulink which is required to establish a collaborative simulation this paper uses c to build a tcp communication interface based on sockets the simulation interface schematic is shown in fig 13 the tcp server is established in the external controller in c and the tcp client is established in the s function in simulink after socket configuration in the external controller the server begins to listen and block until the client asks for a connection then the server sends turbine information to the simulink controller such as generator speed load rotor azimuth angle and current pitch angle this information is processed in simulink and the controller sends the demanded pitch angles and torque to gh bladed the communication interval is set as 10 ms which is consistent with the actual controller of the tct the discrete ipc controllers are built using smc and pi controls in simulink as shown in fig 14 and fig 15 respectively as the rotor speed increases the large phase lag due to the low pass filter pitch actuator and communication interval can no longer be ignored and has a serious negative impact on the control effect thus a phase lead compensator is added before the pi controller 41 e z z 0 9959 z 0 9433 according to the rated tidal velocity of the 600 kw tct 2 5 m s the simulations were conducted under below rated conditions and above rated conditions to investigate the performances of the proposed ipc controllers under various operating conditions the simulation results are plotted from fig 16 to fig 23 the fatigue loads in frequency domain are plotted in logarithmic coordinates as illustrated in fig 16 the power fluctuation under the below rated condition is alleviated by ipc at the cost of power efficiency meanwhile ipc smooths the rotor speed fluctuation and thus help improve the system stability and reliability two control strategies do not exhibit visible differences at their ability to smooth the power and rotor speed fluctuation at the same time fig 20 displays that power becomes smooth when the collective pitch control comes into operation under the above rated conditions this indicates that the engineering significance of power smoothing by ipc mainly occurs under below rated operating conditions the 1p load peak amplitudes in rotational rotor frame of the simulation results are listed in table 1 and demonstrate that compared with the loads without ipc both ipc control strategies have a significant load reduction effect under various operating conditions while the smc has better performance compared with the conventional pi controller the simulation results verify the feasibility of the proposed ipc scheme as indicated in figs 17 and 21 the smc controller responds faster to the regular load change and is more sensitive to small load variations thus the smc controller represents good load reduction performance in full frequency range especially in above rated condition as illustrated in fig 22 and fig 23 nonetheless the conventional pi controller has a distinct advantage in its fewer requirements for sensor numbers in consideration of the fatigue limit the pi controller still has important potential engineering significance besides the load measurement is necessary for both ipc strategies and indirect load measurement can be taken into consideration for load feedback li et al 2020 6 conclusion the severe asymmetrical load of a two bladed 600 kw horizontal axis tct is investigated by sea trial experiments and reproduction simulations as the application of the conventional ipc method has limitations for two bladed turbines a new ipc load reduction method is presented based on blade moment vector analysis in addition a controller using the integral sliding mode control strategy for the two bladed horizontal axis tct is designed for the proposed ipc method the nonlinear switch function is replaced by a linear equivalent function to effectively eliminate sliding mode chatter to validate the feasibility and investigate the performance of the proposed ipc controller a comparative collaborative simulation was carried out using gh bladed and simulink the results demonstrated that the proposed integral smc controller has better performance in fatigue load reduction compared with a conventional pi controller from a practical perspective the proposed ipc strategy is relatively simple and is easy to implement in the actual tct control system without requiring complex calculations and control parameter adjustments this study may give researchers and engineers confidence regarding two bladed tct development in the context of asymmetrical load reduction the design margins of the tct components may be further reduced and two bladed tcts may become more advantageous in terms of energy cost additionally there is a trade off between energy production and fatigue load reduction below rated conditions which can be further studied and evaluated by tct developers however practical applications of individual pitch control for tcts are still in the research stage the implementation of ipc hardware in the cramped space of a hub and its dynamic seal may be two main challenges therefore future studies will include the development of a physical implementation for large scale tidal current velocity including an adaptive algorithm and load estimator will also be considered to improve the smc controller author contribution yangjian li

problem of water with a vertical circular cylinder is verified where the radius is a 20 m and water depth is h 100 m fig 4 is a comparison of wave induced hydrodynamic pressure p w at z h with β 0 computed by the present method and the analytical solution maccamy and fuchs 1954 where ka 0 5 in addition the wave run up ζ around a four cylinder structure is also adopted to verify the proposed

28s and 0 0138 m respectively fig 6 shows the result of the wave run up calculated by the proposed method and cong experiment cong et al 2015 it can be seen that the proposed method agrees well with the experiment result fig 7 is a comparison of earthquake induced hydrodynamic pressure at z h with α 0 computed by the present method and the analytical solution liaw and chopra 1974 where ω 0 2πrad s it can be seen that the proposed method and analytical solutions have a good agreement 4 numerical results this study is mainly to investigate the wave forces and earthquake induced hydrodynamic forces on inclined circular cylinder a dimensionless parameters width to depth ratio l are introduced which is defined as l 2 a h 4 1 wave forces the wave forces on different location of the cylinder along the x axis y axis and z axis can be obtained by 32a f x w z 0 2 π p w e i ω t cos ϕ x b sin η 2 a cos η 2 d η 32b f y w z 0 2 π p w e i ω t cos ϕ y b sin η 2 a cos η 2 d η 32c f z w z 0 2 π p w e i ω t cos ϕ z b sin η 2 a cos η 2 d η then the total wave forces on the cylinder along x axis y axis and z axis can be calculated by f x w 0 h f x w d z f y w 0 h f y w d z and f z w 0 h f z w d z furthermore the total wave force on the cylinder can be obtained by 33 f t w f x w 2 f y w 2 f z w 2 it should be noted that f x w cos γ f z w sin γ for a circular inclined cylinder the maximum values of the wave forces on the inclined cylinder are investigated in the range of 0 2 ka 2 with h 5 m fig 8 presents the maximum values of the total wave forces throughout a wave period for a range of incident angle and cylinder inclination it can be seen that the cylinder inclination and wave incident angle have significant influence on the total forces on an inclined cylinder with fixed ka fig 9 a and b presents the maximum values of the total wave forces throughout a wave period for a range of incident angle with cylinder inclination equal to 60 and 45 respectively it is obviously that the total wave forces on the inclined cylinder increase as wave incident angle increasing in the range of 0 β 90 fig 10 shows wave run up variation with the inclination of the cylinder where h 20 m a 6 m β 0 and ka 0 468 it can be seen that the distribution of the wave run up around the cylinder is significantly different as the variation of the inclination γ it is interesting to see that the wave run up at θ 0 increases as γ decreasing while the wave run up at θ π decreases as γ decreasing 4 2 earthquake induced hydrodynamic forces the research performed by liaw and chopra 1974 and li and yang 2013 indicated that free surface waves have less effect on the earthquake induced hydrodynamic force on cylinders therefore free surface waves are neglected in solving the earthquake induced hydrodynamic forces it should be noted that the neglection of free surface is only suitable for linear wave wave height water depth 0 1 the earthquake induced hydrodynamic forces on different location of the cylinder along the x axis y axis and z axis can be obtained by 34a f x e z 0 2 π p e cos ϕ x b sin η 2 a cos η 2 d η 34b f y e z 0 2 π p e cos ϕ y b sin η 2 a cos η 2 d η 34c f z e z 0 2 π p e cos ϕ z b sin η 2 a cos η 2 d η it should be noted that f x e cos γ f z e sin γ for a circular inclined cylinder therefore the added mass of the inclined cylinder along the x axis y axis and z axis can be calculated by 35a m x z f x e ω 2 u 0 35b m y z f y e ω 2 u 0 35c m z z m x z cot γ fig 11 a and b shows the added mass m x and m y for a range of width to depth ratio l with cylinder inclination equal to 75 respectively it can be seen that the added mass m x and m y decrease as l increasing fig 12 a and b shows the added mass m x and m y for a range of γ with l 0 4 respectively it can be seen that the added mass m x increases as γ increasing while the added mass m y decreases as γ increasing 4 3 simplified formulas of the added mass for convenience of engineering application the added mass m x and m y for an inclined cylinder can be simplified as 36 m x z c x m 0 z 37 m y z c y m 0 z where m 0 z ρ π a 2 c 0 z c 0 z denotes the added mass coefficient of the vertical cylinder c x and c y denote the added mass modified coefficients of the inclined cylinder along x axis and y axis the added mass coefficient of the vertical cylinder c 0 z is expressed as 38 c 0 z j 1 1 j 1 4 2 j 1 π k 1 λ j a λ j a k 0 λ j a k 1 λ j a cos λ j z where λ j 2 j 1 π 2 h and k n are the modified bessel function of the second kind of order n the added mass modified coefficients c x and c y can be calculated by the following formulas 39 c x 0 h m x z d z 0 h m 0 z d z 40 c y 0 h m y z d z 0 h m 0 z d z as known from figs 11 and 12 the added mass modified coefficients c x and c y are relevant to γ and l based on the curve fitting method c x and c y can be firstly fitted as 41 c x τ 11 l τ 12 1 42 c y τ 21 l τ 22 τ 23 where the coefficients τ 11 τ 12 τ 21 τ 22 and τ 23 in the case of different γ are given in table 1 furtherly these coefficients in table 1 are fitted as 43 τ 11 0 202 1 γ 90 2 0 329 1 γ 90 44 τ 12 5 872 1 γ 90 2 4 101 1 γ 90 1 45 τ 21 0 0406 1 γ 90 2 0 0657 1 γ

higher precision can be assured fig 13 shows the comparison of the simplified formulas with the numerical solutions the results indicate that the simplified formulas agree well with numerical solutions 5 conclusions we have considered the wave diffraction and radiation problems due to inclined circular cylinder subjected to wave and earthquake loadings in this study to efficiently solve the diffraction and radiation problems for an inclined circular cylinder a three dimensional finite element model is presented by using a cylindrical absorbing boundary to simulate the infinite fluid which are verified by the analytical solutions of the vertical circular cylinder the numerical examples indicate that the cylinder inclination and wave incident angle have significant influence on the wave forces and earthquake induced hydrodynamic forces on an inclined cylinder the total wave forces on the inclined cylinder increase as wave incident angle increasing in the range of 0 β 90 the added mass of the inclined cylinder along the x axis decrease as width to depth ratio increasing and inclination decreasing while the added mass of the inclined cylinder along the y axis decrease as

forces on inclined circular cylinder a dimensionless parameters width to depth ratio l are introduced which is defined as l 2 a h 4 1 wave forces the wave forces on different location of the cylinder along the x axis y axis and z axis can be obtained by 32a f x w z 0 2 π p w e i ω t cos ϕ x b sin η 2 a cos η 2 d η 32b f y w z 0 2 π p w e i ω t cos ϕ y b sin η 2 a cos η 2 d η 32c f z w z 0 2 π p w

furthermore the total wave force on the cylinder can be obtained by 33 f t w f x w 2 f y w 2 f z w 2 it should be noted that f x w cos γ f z w sin γ for a circular inclined cylinder the maximum values of the wave forces on the inclined cylinder are investigated in the range of 0 2 ka 2 with h 5 m fig 8 presents the maximum values of the total wave forces throughout a wave period for a range of incident angle and cylinder inclination it can be seen that the cylinder inclination and wave incident angle have significant influence on the total forces on an inclined cylinder with fixed ka fig 9 a and b presents the maximum values of the total wave forces throughout a wave period for a range of incident angle with cylinder inclination equal to 60 and 45 respectively it is obviously that the total wave forces on the inclined cylinder increase as wave incident angle increasing in the range of 0 β 90 fig 10 shows wave run up variation with the inclination of the cylinder where h 20 m a 6 m β 0 and ka 0 468 it can be seen that the distribution of the wave run up around the cylinder is significantly different as the variation of the inclination γ it is interesting to see that the wave run up at θ 0 increases as γ decreasing while the wave run up at θ π decreases as γ decreasing 4 2 earthquake induced hydrodynamic forces the research performed by liaw and chopra 1974 and li and yang 2013 indicated that free surface waves have less effect on the earthquake induced hydrodynamic force on cylinders therefore free surface waves are neglected in solving the earthquake induced hydrodynamic forces it should be noted that the neglection of free surface is only suitable for linear wave wave height water depth 0 1 the earthquake induced hydrodynamic forces on different location of the cylinder along the x axis y axis and z axis can be obtained by 34a f x e z 0 2 π p e cos ϕ x b sin η 2 a cos η 2 d η 34b f y e z 0 2 π p e cos ϕ y b sin η 2 a cos η 2 d η 34c f z e z 0 2 π p e cos ϕ z b sin η 2 a cos η 2 d η it should be noted that f x e cos γ f z e sin γ for a circular inclined cylinder therefore the added mass of the inclined cylinder along the x axis y axis and z axis can be calculated by 35a m x z f x e ω 2 u 0 35b m y z f y e ω 2 u 0 35c m z z m x z cot γ fig 11 a and b shows the added mass m x and m y for a range of width to depth ratio l with cylinder inclination equal to 75 respectively it can be seen that the added mass m x and m y decrease as l increasing fig 12 a and b shows the added mass m x and m y for a range of γ with l 0 4 respectively it can be seen that the added mass m x increases as γ increasing while the added mass m y decreases as γ increasing 4 3 simplified formulas of the added mass for convenience of engineering application

relevant to γ and l based on the curve fitting method c x and c y can be firstly fitted as 41 c x τ 11 l τ 12 1 42 c y τ 21 l τ 22 τ 23 where the coefficients τ 11 τ 12 τ 21 τ 22 and τ 23 in the case of different γ are given in table 1 furtherly these coefficients in table 1 are fitted as 43 τ 11 0 202 1 γ 90 2 0 329 1 γ 90 44 τ 12 5 872 1 γ 90 2 4 101 1 γ 90 1 45 τ 21 0 0406 1 γ 90 2 0 0657 1 γ

higher precision can be assured fig 13 shows the comparison of the simplified formulas with the numerical solutions the results indicate that the simplified formulas agree well with numerical solutions 5 conclusions we have considered the wave diffraction and radiation problems due to inclined circular cylinder subjected to wave and earthquake loadings in this study to efficiently solve
