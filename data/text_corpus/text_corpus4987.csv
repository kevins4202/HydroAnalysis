24935,the distribution of marine organisms is strongly influenced by climatic gradients worldwide the ecological niche sensu hutchinson of a species i e the combination of environmental tolerances and resources required by an organism interacts with the environment to determine its geographical range this duality between niche and distribution allows climate change biologists to model potential species distributions from past to future conditions while species distribution models sdms have been intensively used over the last years no consensual framework to parametrise calibrate and evaluate models has emerged here to model the contemporary 1990 2017 spatial distribution of seven highly harvested european small pelagic fish species we implemented a comprehensive and replicable numerical procedure based on 8 sdms 7 from the biomod2 framework plus the nppen model this procedure considers critical issues in species distribution modelling such as sampling bias pseudo absence selection model evaluation and uncertainty quantification respectively through i an environmental filtration of observation data ii a convex hull based pseudo absence selection iii a multi criteria evaluation of model outputs and iv an ensemble modelling approach by mitigating environmental sampling bias in observation data and by identifying the most ecologically relevant predictors our framework helps to improve the modelling of fish species environmental suitability not only average temperature but also temperature variability appears as major factors driving small pelagic fish distribution and areas of highest environmental suitability were found along the north western mediterranean coasts the bay of biscay and the north sea we demonstrate in this study that the use of appropriate data pre processing techniques an often overlooked step in modelling increase model predictive performance strengthening our confidence in the reliability of predictions keywords species distribution models

rais lasram et al 2010 beaugrand et al 2011 raybaud et al 2017 temperature is known as a master parameter driving fish distribution at a macroecological level lenoir et al 2011 beaugrand et al 2018 this parameter influences a large range of biological processes such as growth reproduction larval development recruitment and act as a major stressing factor depending on species thermal tolerance psychrophile or thermophile species angilletta 2011 beaugrand and kirby 2018 salinity oxygen concentration primary production that are indirectly influenced by changes in temperature e g kirby and beaugrand 2009 or the physical habitat e g sediment type poloczanska et al 2013 may also highly influence marine fish species at different spatial scales hutchinson 1957 conceptualised the ecological niche as the n dimensional ensemble of environmental conditions that enable a species to live and reproduce and subsequently made a distinction between the fundamental and the realised niche hutchinson 1978 due to biotic interactions dispersal limitation and or historical factors soberon and peterson 2005 species generally occupy only their realised niche i e the subset of their fundamental niche that represents the response of all physiological processes of a species to the synergistic effects of environmental conditions helaouet and beaugrand 2009 beaugrand et al 2013 by defining the niche as an attribute of species instead of a portion of the environment the hutchinson s concept enables duality between niche and distribution pulliam 2000 colwell and rangel 2009 such a relationship is of major interest in biogeography as each georeferenced species occurrence i e where a given species has been observed can be related to several environmental parameters such as temperature salinity and primary production when species are in equilibrium with their environment associating environmental conditions and observed distributions permits climate change biologists to estimate species potential niche jiménez valverde et al 2008 the relationship between species occurrences environmental conditions and species potential niche has become intensively studied over the last two decades using a wide range of modelling techniques hereafter referred to as species distribution models sdms to assess past contemporary and future species distribution in both marine and terrestrial ecosystems e g cheung et al 2009 bellard et al 2016 cristofari et al 2018 sdms rely on several ecological assumptions such as species distribution in equilibrium or habitat saturation soberon and peterson 2005 niche conservatism crisp et al 2009 unlimited dispersal abilities wiens et al 2009 or the non influential role of biotic interactions in shaping large scale distributions i e the gleasonian vision of biotic communities gleason 1926 guisan and thuiller 2005 wiens et al 2009 superimposed to these assumptions several sources of errors and uncertainties may lead to variation sometimes conflicting in the outputs of sdms for a given species beaumont et al 2008 i accuracy of observation data and ii lack of true absences proosdij et al 2016 iii identification of ecologically meaningful environmental predictors with high explanatory power guisan and thuiller 2005 iv choice of the modelling algorithm buisson et al 2010 and v sdms evaluation processes leroy et al 2018 while tremendous progresses have been made on both the building and evaluation of sdms in recent years with a plethora of new methods for modelling species distribution araújo and guisan 2006 leroy et al 2018 støa et al 2018 the development of further procedures is still required for improving the quality of sdms species distribution models are known to be very sensitive to different sources of uncertainties and sustained attention should be devoted to each step of the modelling procedure from the pre processing of species occurrences data to model evaluation such an approach is essential to increase confidence in model outputs porfirio et al 2014 for most areas of the world and species survey effort often exhibits strong spatial and temporal bias occurrence records being frequently too scarce constrained to presence only data or both working with biased observation datasets may result in under or over estimated species distributional ranges araújo and guisan 2006 dormann et al 2007 leading therefore to inaccurate modelled contemporary distributions which are inadequate for assessing potential future range shifts or for defining conservation measures similarly biased pseudo absence datasets e g multiple pseudo absences selected in the same environmental conditions or coinciding with environmental conditions where the species is observed may lead to a distorted estimation of species distributional ranges e g wisz and guisan 2009 lobo and tognelli 2011 a modelling framework that includes a preliminary stage devoted to the construction of a representative calibration dataset as well as its associated level of uncertainty assessment is therefore essential e g varela et al 2014 here we developed a framework that encompasses recent advances on the building calibration and evaluation of sdms with the aim of i selecting the most relevant environmental parameters ii generating consistent pseudo absence data and iii validating representative model outputs cornwell et al 2004 varela et al 2014 leroy et al 2018 we applied this framework on seven economically important european small pelagic fish spf species mediterranean horse mackerel trachurus mediterraneus atlantic horse mackerel trachurus trachurus european pilchard sardina pilchardus round sardinella sardinella aurita european sprat sprattus sprattus european anchovy engraulis encrasicolus and bogue boops boops these seven spf species are widely distributed planktonic feeders known for their central role in marine food webs cury 2000 checkley et al 2009 moreover they are of major economic importance and represent a large part of the mediterranean and black sea commercial landings more than 50 between 2000 and 2013 fao 2016 however while spfs are ideal candidates for sdms because of their sensitivity to environmental factors perry et al 2005 their european distribution is far from being exhaustively documented and available records originated from diverse and or non standardised monitoring surveys fao 2016 2 material and methods 2 1 biological and environmental data 2 1 1 small pelagic fish occurrence data occurrence records e g fisheries independent trawl surveys discrete research samplings for the seven spf species mediterranean horse mackerel atlantic horse mackerel european pilchard round sardinella european sprat european anchovy and bogue were compiled from three available public databases the ocean biogeographic information system mapper obis http www iobis org mapper the global biodiversity information facility gbif https www gbif org and fishbase http www fishbase org when possible we included observations retrieved from the literature to construct the most up to date datasets encompassing their entire distribution range see supplementary material 1 biological data retrieved for our study ranged from 1950 to 2017 recent records since 1990 prevailing 83 2 6 7 over both past 1950 1990 12 2 8 7 and undated observations 4 6 3 6 past or undated records were only considered along the distribution edge when the species presence was confirmed by recent records this precautionary approach avoided over or under predictions of the model due to low quality presence data kramer schadt et al 2013 the observation records pre processing consisted in a data cleaning procedure applied on each species dataset to i remove unreliable observations e g preserved specimen newbold 2010 and false identifications e g taxonomic confusion ii discard duplicate occurrences and iii ensure the temporal and locational reliability at the edge of the observed distribution e g data on land longitudinal and or latitudinal inversion historical or undated data according to the ecology of spfs species cannot be observed below 300 m depth checkley et al 2009 while remaining permissive a precautionary bathymetry threshold 1000 m was applied to remove inconsistent occurrences following this pre processing we obtained seven clean datasets with a number of observations ranging from 1314 for mediterranean horse mackerel to 24 806 for european sprat for the seven spfs occurrences were aggregated on a 0 1 0 1 spatial grid from 70 n to 70 s and 180 e to 180 w that corresponds to that of environmental parameters 2 1 2 environmental data to calculate the ecological niche sensu hutchinson 1957 of each spf we collected environmental parameters from different databases see table 1 for details environmental parameters values for each spatial grid cell were first calculated for each year and then averaged on the 1990 2017 period the environmental parameters presented in table 1 were retrieved in different spatial resolutions ranging from 0 1 to 0 5 for modelling purpose all variables were therefore interpolated to a 0 1 0 1 grid using a bilinear interpolation in the geographical domain available for all environmental parameters ranging from 70 n to 70 s and 180 e to 180 w 2 2 description of the models we used two approaches to model the potential environmental suitability i e spatialised index between 0 and 1 defined as a probability of presence based on environmental parameters of each spf species over the 1990 2017 period i the non parametric probabilistic ecological niche nppen beaugrand et al 2011 model and ii seven modelling algorithms available within the biomod2 package thuiller et al 2016 the nppen model is a presence only model based on the mahalanobis generalised distance mahalanobis 1936 and on a modified version of the multiple response permutation procedure mrpp mielke et al 1981 the biomod2 framework allows ensemble modelling of species distribution i e an average model of a wide range of algorithms thuiller et al 2009 here seven algorithms were considered i generalised linear model glm ii generalised additive model gam iii generalised boosting model gbm iv artificial neural network ann v flexible discriminant analysis fda vi multiple adaptive regression splines mars and vii random forest rf because the models used in this study have been already described and discussed in several publications e g beaugrand et al 2011 lenoir et al 2011 raybaud et al 2015 for nppen e g thuiller et al 2009 albouy et al 2012 bellard et al 2013 for biomod2 we refer the reader to this literature for further information the algorithms were calibrated using the default parameters in biomod2 optimised for species distribution modelling details in thuiller et al 2016 by including this large range of algorithms within an ensemble model approach we quantified the uncertainty related to the selection of sdms pearson et al 2006 buisson et al 2010 by calculating the standard deviation sd and the coefficient of variation cv among sdm outputs 2 3 data preparation and ensemble model selection 2 3 1 pre selection of the environmental parameters and assessment of multicollinearity to model the ecological niche of the seven spfs we first constructed the full dataset of environmental parameters based on our knowledge of the ecology of spfs a variable selection process fig 1 step 1 was then applied to identify at the species level the most parsimonious dataset that explained each species distribution this process follows the procedure described in leroy et al 2014 and bellard et al 2016 because most of the algorithms especially regression based models such as glm are sensitive to multicollinearity that may distort model estimation dormann et al 2013 relations among environmental parameters were assessed by means of the pearson correlation coefficient using a threshold r 0 7 to reduce the initial environmental matrix when two or more environmental parameters showed correlation values above this threshold only one variable was retained details in supplementary material 2 we subsequently assessed the relative importance of each environmental parameter by sequentially randomising each variable and by calculating the resulting current distribution leroy et al 2014 the variables that best predicted spf distribution were sea surface temperature annual mean sst temperature variability sea surface temperature annual range or monthly variance depending on the targeted species bathymetry and distance to coast see supplementary material 2 in order to avoid model over parameterisation that affects model performance model transferability and assessment of variable importance we chose not to include bathymetry and distance to coast directly in the models but in a hierarchical filtering approach hattab et al 2014 for a given geographical cell environmental conditions were considered as suitable for a marine species only if a probability of occurrence coincided with a distance to coast less than 50 km or up to a 300 m depth for oceanic cells i e outside the 50 km wide coastal area concerning environmental predictors we systematically considered temperature mean and variability in our models finally we tested the relevance of including sea surface salinity sss and or primary production log pp as a potential third explanatory environmental parameter in the models each run is detailed in supplementary material 3 2 3 2 environmental filtration and pseudo absence selection because sampling effort is neither homogeneous and nor standardised over marine regions occurrence data may not be representative of the whole populations a requirement to increase the reliability of sdms lobo and tognelli 2011 while under sampling is commonly observed at the edge of species range varela et al 2014 observation datasets can also be biased toward regions more comprehensively investigated due to an easy access or a long tradition of monitoring fithian et al 2015 to consider the risk of over sampling and the ensuing over representation of environmental features kramer schadt et al 2013 we first homogenised species datasets to assign the same weight to over and under sampled regions fig 1 step 2 a multidimensional matrix was designed for each species and each combination of environmental parameters a dimension reflecting an environmental factor each cell of the homogenised matrix was considered as an environmental stratum i e a combination of a set of parameters with the following resolution 0 5 c for temperature related parameters 0 5 for sss and 0 5 mol m 2 s 1 in log for primary production in case an environmental stratum contained multiple occurrences only one occurrence i e one 0 1 0 1 geographical cell with the corresponding environmental conditions was kept in the homogenised dataset we also considered the lack of absence data to assess this gap we generated pseudo absences using the convex hull method cornwell et al 2004 getz and wilmers 2006 the convex hull was defined here as the smallest convex hyper volume in the environmental space containing all species observation records a restricted convex hull see fig 2 has been defined as a convex hull excluding occurrence points within the 2 5 and 97 5 percentiles for each environmental parameter i e excluding observations in the most extreme environmental conditions this restricted convex hull is considered as a proxy of the suitable environmental conditions outside which pseudo absences were randomly generated in equal number to the filtered occurrences as recommended by the d designs theory montgomery 2005 the optimal design to minimise prediction variance is when an equal number of observations are at opposite value extremes montgomery 2005 hengl et al 2009 and when there is a high spreading in the feature space finally for each species pseudo absence were projected back in geographical cells showing environmental conditions outside spf species environmentally favourable areas fig 2 varela et al 2014 finally model outputs obtained from our environmental filtration approach were compared with outputs for which neither environmental filtration nor the convex hull pseudo absence selection method was applied fig 3 2 3 3 validation and selection of the best models we then quantified the performance of our models using five commonly used evaluation metrics i the continuous boyce index cbi hirzel et al 2006 a metric specifically designed for presence only models and insensitive to pseudo absences ii the area under the curve auc swets 1988 fielding and bell 1997 iii the true skill statistic tss allouche et al 2006 iv the jaccard and v the sørensen similarity indices jaccard 1908 sørensen 1948 however because all evaluation metrics except the cbi require both presence and absence data see discussion in leroy et al 2018 about the use of pseudo absence to evaluate the performance of models and because some may be affected by prevalence i e the ratio between the number of observed presence and generated pseudo absence leroy et al 2018 we based our selection process of the best models on cbi values only we considered models to be wrong when cbi values were below 0 5 average to random for values ranging from 0 5 to 0 5 and good for values above 0 5 faillettaz et al 2019 for each model we computed evaluation metrics by performing a cross validation procedure with 10 repetitions we randomly sampled 70 of the occurrence data to calibrate the model and kept the remaining 30 for model validation merow et al 2013 following the evaluation strip method detailed by elith et al 2005 the adequacy between observed and modelled spatial distributions was also assessed by means of response curves for a given environmental parameter the corresponding response curve was calculated while keeping the other parameters constant i e at the mean value corresponding to their occurrence points by doing this we identified spurious results e g we do not expect bimodal responses to temperature and or unexpected distribution ranges e g large portions of predicted range in regions where the species has never been observed and vice versa supplementary material 4 3 results 3 1 sdms and parameters selected in the ensemble models based on the calculation of the cbi values and the examination of species response curves supplementary material 3 and 4 we identified the best models for each spf species our results showed that both glm and nppen models were almost always selected in the ensemble model except for the european anchovy ensemble models showed that temperature related variables were essential to assess the spatial distribution of spfs for virtually all species the models that considered mean temperature and variability showed high ability to reproduce the overall spfs distributions table 2 supplementary material 3 with cbi values always above 0 5 faillettaz et al 2019 however some discrepancies were observed among species while mediterranean horse mackerel atlantic horse mackerel and european anchovy distributions were more related to mean monthly temperature variance sstvar european pilchard round sardinella european sprat and bogue distributions were better reproduced when mean annual temperature range sstr was considered despite the high correlation between sstr and sstvar r 0 80 supplementary material 2 both variables have dissimilar ecological influences seasonality versus short term climatic variability respectively primary production also emerged as important to model species spatial distribution finally we highlighted the important role of sea surface salinity sss for both european pilchard and european anchovy by discriminating both the baltic and the black seas from other regions table 2 by applying our environmental filtration framework we substantially improved the modelling of most of the spfs spatial distributions fig 3 individual contributions of the filtration process and the convexhull are presented in supplementary material 5 except for the european pilchard fig 3b specifically we observed an increase in mean cbi values that ranged from 0 05 to 0 23 fig 3 for most spfs lower environmental suitability index esi values were obtained 0 2 without filtration to 0 6 with filtration suggesting that our procedure alleviated the risk of over prediction especially in the black and baltic seas and beyond 60 n where species have never been observed fig 4 left panels by increasing esi values from 0 4 to 0 6 environmental filtration also emphasised regions known to be highly suitable for spf species but in which occurrences were only scarcely available e g in the eastern mediterranean sea for atlantic horse mackerel round sardinella and bogue fig 4a f and g 3 2 contemporary 1990 2017 environmental suitability of small pelagic fishes we then represented the contemporary 1990 2017 spatial distribution of the seven spfs in the spatial domain ranging from 10 to 70 n and from 30 w to 45 e fig 4 middle panel environmental suitabilities at the calibration range i e the entire distribution range are provided in supplementary material 6 according to the observed and modelled distributions fig 4 left and middle panels two species groups were identified with respect to their environmental suitability along the european coasts the first group encompassed temperate to cold water species hereafter temperate cold species i e atlantic horse mackerel european pilchard european sprat and european anchovy fig 4a d that were more likely to be present in northern europe the second grouped temperate to warm water species hereafter temperate warm species i e mediterranean horse mackerel round sardinella and bogue fig 4e g located along the mediterranean coasts down to north africa the four temperate cold species showed the highest esi values in the north sea in the celtic sea in the bay of biscay esi values 0 8 and to a lesser extent along norwegian coasts esi values ranging from 0 2 to 0 8 for all temperate cold species but european pilchard high esi values from 0 4 to 0 8 were expected in the western and central regions of the baltic sea fig 4 suggesting that these species can tolerate a wide salinity range from 8 to 38 and a high thermal variability up to 20 c annual range all temperate cold species but european sprat showed high esi values from 0 6 to 0 8 in the north western part of the mediterranean basin fig 4 for all temperate cold species the modelled esis are in accordance with the observation data except in southern iceland western norway and to a lesser extent in the eastern black sea where positive esi values between 0 05 to 0 6 are predicted while no observed distribution is available the three temperate warm species showed the highest esi values from 0 4 to 0 8 in nearly all the regions of the mediterranean sea and medium to low esi values from 0 2 to 0 7 in the black sea and along the north western african coasts however some discrepancies among species were detected fig 4 round sardinella appears as the most southern spf species with no suitable conditions north of the portuguese coast on the contrary mediterranean horse mackerel and bogue showed high esi values from 0 6 to 0 8 along the atlantic coasts from the celtic sea down to northern africa up to 0 8 in the bay of biscay while bogue showed maximum esi values 0 8 in the whole mediterranean sea only the north western regions of the mediterranean sea were highly suitable for mediterranean horse mackerel and round sardinella the modelled esis are in accordance with the observation data except in the north sea for mediterranean horse mackerel and bogue and to a lesser extent in the eastern black sea for all temperate warm species these regions highlight positive esi values between 0 05 and 0 6 while no observations are available these discrepancies may result from an absence of sampling in these regions or external factors hindering species establishment despite suitable environmental conditions 3 3 model uncertainties two main sources of uncertainties in projected species distributions were considered in our study i biological uncertainties related to the quality of occurrence datasets and ii numerical uncertainties inherent to the selection of different modelling algorithms pearson et al 2006 buisson et al 2010 standard deviations sd computed for each species from outputs that originated from both selected algorithms and cross validation runs ranged from 0 1 to 0 4 indicating a convergence between models fig 4 right panels the lowest sd values close to 0 2 were found in the north western mediterranean sea for virtually all spfs and in the bay of biscay and in the north sea when temperate cold species were studied fig 4 a d the highest sd values close to 0 4 were observed in the mediterranean sea for mediterranean horse mackerel european pilchard and round sardinella fig 4 e g for all species the coefficient of variation cv supplementary material 7 highlighted very low cv variations 20 towards their centre of distribution in the mediterranean sea for all species and north sea for temperate cold species while showing high variations at the leading or the trailing edge of their distribution up to 100 in the black baltic and the norwegian seas 4 discussion by combining several numerical techniques such as the convex hull method the ensemble models approach and an examination of species response curves in a comprehensive modelling framework we modelled the contemporary 1990 2017 environmental suitability of seven of the most commercially and ecologically important european small pelagic fish by relying on both an understanding of the ecological requirements of species and on the use of innovative statistical tools our framework allowed us to focus only on the best models to improve the way species distribution modelling is carried out and therefore to produce more robust ecological scenarios at a macroecological level thermal induced effects have been frequently related to latitudinal mean temperature gradients angilletta 2011 while our analysis showed that mean temperature sst had a major influence on species distributions we also revealed the key role of temperature seasonality sstr and short term temperature variations sstvar in shaping distributional ranges table 2 small pelagic fishes are marine ectotherms that mainly depend on external heat sources their body temperature being directly controlled by environmental conditions directly checkley et al 2009 changes in temperature may therefore affect spfs physiological performances i e their fitness perry et al 2005 payne et al 2016 because the relationship between temperature and fitness occurred through species thermal optimum and range and because spfs are short lifespan species checkley et al 2009 annual temperature changes may affect several life stages especially reproduction and larval development e g peck et al 2013 with long term consequences on population dynamics fréon et al 2005 small pelagic fishes may also experience ontogenetic shifts in thermal tolerance during their development peck et al 2013 and temperature seasonality here sstr may either favour or perturb species development with potential consequences on distributional patterns fig 4 middle panels peck et al 2013 this is especially noticeable in regions characterised by an important thermal variability such as in the black and azov seas in the northern adriatic sea in the baltic sea and to a lesser extent in the eastern part of the north sea considering thermal variability in sdms e g the monthly sst variance may therefore help to better define species environmental suitability and to minimise the risk of over prediction at the leading and the trailing edges of their distributions lenoir et al 2011 when used in distribution modelling regression based algorithms such as glm are known to be rather sensitive to environmental sampling bias which may induce type i errors i e false positive with consequences on projected species environmental suitability araújo and guisan 2006 dormann et al 2007 however as for many other species e g boakes et al 2010 commonly available databases of spfs provide a distorted view of their actual distribution because of spatial and temporal bias in species observations e g beck et al 2014 when the time comes to evaluate the quality of biodiversity datasets three major issues have been raised in the literature e g kramer schadt et al 2013 guillera arroita et al 2015 the influence of i prevalence i e the proportion of sites in which the species was recorded as present ii imperfect species detection and iii sampling bias despite an increasing availability of information the biogeographic distribution of most species remain still frequently incomplete bini et al 2006 a shortcoming explained inter alia by heterogeneous sampling effort among surveys or the inaccessibility of some areas for all spf datasets this effect is undeniable when comparing the north western mediterranean sea the bay of biscay the north sea with other european regions fig 4 left panels to lower this issue a plethora of data sources e g standardised scientific surveys biodiversity portals are now available in collaborative databases e g gbif offering more cohesive summaries of species distributions although leading sometimes to enhanced spatial and environmental biases kramer schadt et al 2013 beck et al 2014 considering independent distributional data i e from private collections or from the literature beck et al 2013 along with the associated pre processing e g kramer schadt et al 2013 varela et al 2014 aiello lammens et al 2015 fithian et al 2015 can contribute to cover the ecological niches of species more comprehensively and to improve model accuracy by coupling these procedures with our restricting convex hull pseudo absence selection we i assigned the same weight to environmental conditions independently of the observation density i e alleviating observation sampling bias ii lowered the weight of presence records at the distribution edge i e avoiding the risk of over prediction and iii selected unbiased pseudo absence i e independent of the observation bias applying environmental filtering and the restricted convexhull pseudo absence selection method resulted in ensemble models characterised by a reduced esi in over sampled areas and an increased esi in undersampled areas our results are consistent with our expectations and in line with previous studies that suggested that random generation of pseudo absences and or a selection process based on geographical criterion may lead to lower predictability e g wisz and guisan 2009 hattab et al 2014 although real absences lead to higher model accuracy wisz and guisan 2009 they are rarely available boakes et al 2010 and determining the location of pseudo absences on the basis of a statistical analysis such as the convex hull is a reliable alternative hattab et al 2013 finally our approach limits spurious species response curves i e overfitted or bimodal curves supplementary material 4 and decreases the risk of over predictions towards the edge of the species range we acknowledge that we may have slightly underpredicted the european pilchard distribution in kattegat i e strait between denmark and sweden the high amount of occurrence records slightly outside the modelled distribution in this region may have biased the calculation of the cbi despite the well known robustness of this index breiner et al 2015 faillettaz et al 2019 our result highlight that no evaluation metric is optimal and that both comparison between observed and modelled distributions and examination of species responses curves are essential for assessing the reliability of model outputs while the assessment of the environmental suitability for a given species may differ slightly or markedly from one sdm to another pearson et al 2006 buisson et al 2010 it is still challenging to identify the most appropriate model see discussion in buisson et al 2010 even if several methods have been recently proposed no consensus has emerged see discussion in leroy et al 2018 and the use of different well fitted and evaluated sdms may help to better simulate potential species distributions for past contemporary and future environmental conditions araújo and new 2007 in complementarity with a multi sdm approach we think that researchers should examine species response curves during the evaluation process e g elith and leathwick 2009 jarnevich et al 2018 erauskin extramiana et al 2019 as observed for mediterranean horse mackerel see details in supplementary material 4 we invalidated response curves that were statistically significant but not in agreement with the ecological niche theory without this complementary evaluation method the corresponding algorithms would have been considered in the ensemble model therefore potentially resulting in spurious patterns of esis therefore this multi criteria evaluation procedure is of great interest from a i numerical i e metric adapted to presence only datasets and an ecological i e validation of the species environment relationships perspective note that the seven spfs we chose are representative of a large spectrum of environmental conditions from temperate to cold waters e g european sprat to temperate to warm waters e g bogue and round sardinella to conclude our framework has been faced with a wide range of environmental conditions allowing us to better evaluate its robustness sensitivity and possible transferability to other species and ecosystems in this work we have estimated species potential niche and not the realised niche soberón and nakamura 2009 we caution that additional environmental parameters biological interactions and species life traits e g dispersal abilities may explain why we detected environmentally suitable conditions in regions where spfs were not observed e g the norwegian sea pulliam 2000 pearman et al 2008 considering the role of biotic interactions in shaping species distributions chaalali et al 2016 would improve the reliability of sdms outputs by better estimating and simulating the realised niche of species wisz et al 2013 louthan et al 2015 including dispersal mechanisms while accounting for oceanic currents and physical barriers after the potential distribution modelling step may help to refine the distributional range of species engler and guisan 2009 these approaches require an exhaustive ecological understanding of the interaction process at a macroecological scale and a deep knowledge of species life traits to implement metrics that simulate the ability of species to disperse e g petitgas et al 2012 moreover it is important to notice that no direct correlations between esi potential or realised and spatialised biomass or official catches have been established in the literature although temporal correlations have been suggested however e g chaalali et al 2016 therefore discrepancies between spf s esi biomass and official catches e g fao 2016 may be explained by population related parameters e g recruitment growth biotic interaction or management policies and stock status e g under or over fishing respectively finally inter specific absolute esi comparison is challenging because of the monospecific nature of sdms our study presents a detailed environmental suitability assessment of seven of the most heavily harvested european spfs by focusing on the most common sources of errors and uncertainties in sdms we designed a comprehensive fully transferable to other species and ecosystems modelling framework which is intended to elaborate more robust ecological scenarios our framework addressed several critical steps in sdms i e the treatment of sampling biases in observation records the generation relevant pseudo absences and a dual assessment of model outputs that proposes to evaluate models from both a numerical and an ecological perspective in a conservation decision making perspective these different steps are essential to increase confidence in sdms a prerequisite to propose effective resource management measures e g accounting for environmental stress or to measure the effectiveness of protected areas e g regarding environmental resilience moreover when used in combination with scenarios of future environmental conditions i e ipcc climate scenarios this framework provides robust contemporary predictions to assess possible changes in species distribution in the context of global climate change despite the growing literature on the development and testing of new modelling and evaluation processes the use of sdms in quantitative resource management and scientific surveys is still a great challenge funding this work was supported by the prince albert ii of monaco foundationthrough the project clim eco²

24935,the distribution of marine organisms is strongly influenced by climatic gradients worldwide the ecological niche sensu hutchinson of a species i e the combination of environmental tolerances and resources required by an organism interacts with the environment to determine its geographical range this duality between niche and distribution allows climate change biologists to model potential species distributions from past to future conditions while species distribution models sdms have been intensively used over the last years no consensual framework to parametrise calibrate and evaluate models has emerged here to model the contemporary 1990 2017 spatial distribution of seven highly harvested european small pelagic fish species we implemented a comprehensive and replicable numerical procedure based on 8 sdms 7 from the biomod2 framework plus the nppen model this procedure considers critical issues in species distribution modelling such as sampling bias pseudo absence selection model evaluation and uncertainty quantification respectively through i an environmental filtration of observation data ii a convex hull based pseudo absence selection iii a multi criteria evaluation of model outputs and iv an ensemble modelling approach by mitigating environmental sampling bias in observation data and by identifying the most ecologically relevant predictors our framework helps to improve the modelling of fish species environmental suitability not only average temperature but also temperature variability appears as major factors driving small pelagic fish distribution and areas of highest environmental suitability were found along the north western mediterranean coasts the bay of biscay and the north sea we demonstrate in this study that the use of appropriate data pre processing techniques an often overlooked step in modelling increase model predictive performance strengthening our confidence in the reliability of predictions keywords species distribution models

rais lasram et al 2010 beaugrand et al 2011 raybaud et al 2017 temperature is known as a master parameter driving fish distribution at a macroecological level lenoir et al 2011 beaugrand et al 2018 this parameter influences a large range of biological processes such as growth reproduction larval development recruitment and act as a major stressing factor depending on species thermal tolerance psychrophile or thermophile species angilletta 2011 beaugrand and kirby 2018 salinity oxygen concentration primary production that are indirectly influenced by changes in temperature e g kirby and beaugrand 2009 or the physical habitat e g sediment type poloczanska et al 2013 may also highly influence marine fish species at different spatial scales hutchinson 1957 conceptualised the ecological niche as the n dimensional ensemble of environmental conditions that enable a species to live and reproduce and subsequently made a distinction between the fundamental and the realised niche hutchinson 1978 due to biotic interactions dispersal limitation and or historical factors soberon and peterson 2005 species generally occupy only their realised niche i e the subset of their fundamental niche that represents the response of all physiological processes of a species to the synergistic effects of environmental conditions helaouet and beaugrand 2009 beaugrand et al 2013 by defining the niche as an attribute of species instead of a portion of the environment the hutchinson s concept enables duality between niche and distribution pulliam 2000 colwell and rangel 2009 such a relationship is of major interest in biogeography as each georeferenced species occurrence i e where a given species has been observed can be related to several environmental parameters such as temperature salinity and primary production when species are in equilibrium with their environment associating environmental conditions and observed distributions permits climate change biologists to estimate species potential niche jiménez valverde et al 2008 the relationship between species occurrences environmental conditions and species potential niche has become intensively studied over the last two decades using a wide range of modelling techniques hereafter referred to as species distribution models sdms to assess past contemporary and future species distribution in both marine and terrestrial ecosystems e g cheung et al 2009 bellard et al 2016 cristofari et al 2018 sdms rely on several ecological assumptions such as species distribution in equilibrium or habitat saturation soberon and peterson 2005 niche conservatism crisp et al 2009 unlimited dispersal abilities wiens et al 2009 or the non influential role of biotic interactions in shaping large scale distributions i e the gleasonian vision of biotic communities gleason 1926 guisan and thuiller 2005 wiens et al 2009 superimposed to these assumptions several sources of errors and uncertainties may lead to variation sometimes conflicting in the outputs of sdms for a given species beaumont et al 2008 i accuracy of observation data and ii lack of true absences proosdij et al 2016 iii identification of ecologically meaningful environmental predictors with high explanatory power guisan and thuiller 2005 iv choice of the modelling algorithm buisson et al 2010 and v sdms evaluation processes leroy et al 2018 while tremendous progresses have been made on both the building and evaluation of sdms in recent years with a plethora of new methods for modelling species distribution araújo and guisan 2006 leroy et al 2018 støa et al 2018 the development of further procedures is still required for improving the quality of sdms species distribution models are known to be very sensitive to different sources of uncertainties and sustained attention should be devoted to each step of the modelling procedure from the pre processing of species occurrences data to model evaluation such an approach is essential to increase confidence in model outputs porfirio et al 2014 for most areas of the world and species survey effort often exhibits strong spatial and temporal bias occurrence records being frequently too scarce constrained to presence only data or both working with biased observation datasets may result in under or over estimated species distributional ranges araújo and guisan 2006 dormann et al 2007 leading therefore to inaccurate modelled contemporary distributions which are inadequate for assessing potential future range shifts or for defining conservation measures similarly biased pseudo absence datasets e g multiple pseudo absences selected in the same environmental conditions or coinciding with environmental conditions where the species is observed may lead to a distorted estimation of species distributional ranges e g wisz and guisan 2009 lobo and tognelli 2011 a modelling framework that includes a preliminary stage devoted to the construction of a representative calibration dataset as well as its associated level of uncertainty assessment is therefore essential e g varela et al 2014 here we developed a framework that encompasses recent advances on the building calibration and evaluation of sdms with the aim of i selecting the most relevant environmental parameters ii generating consistent pseudo absence data and iii validating representative model outputs cornwell et al 2004 varela et al 2014 leroy et al 2018 we applied this framework on seven economically important european small pelagic fish spf species mediterranean horse mackerel trachurus mediterraneus atlantic horse mackerel trachurus trachurus european pilchard sardina pilchardus round sardinella sardinella aurita european sprat sprattus sprattus european anchovy engraulis encrasicolus and bogue boops boops these seven spf species are widely distributed planktonic feeders known for their central role in marine food webs cury 2000 checkley et al 2009 moreover they are of major economic importance and represent a large part of the mediterranean and black sea commercial landings more than 50 between 2000 and 2013 fao 2016 however while spfs are ideal candidates for sdms because of their sensitivity to environmental factors perry et al 2005 their european distribution is far from being exhaustively documented and available records originated from diverse and or non standardised monitoring surveys fao 2016 2 material and methods 2 1 biological and environmental data 2 1 1 small pelagic fish occurrence data occurrence records e g fisheries independent trawl surveys discrete research samplings for the seven spf species mediterranean horse mackerel atlantic horse mackerel european pilchard round sardinella european sprat european anchovy and bogue were compiled from three available public databases the ocean biogeographic information system mapper obis http www iobis org mapper the global biodiversity information facility gbif https www gbif org and fishbase http www fishbase org when possible we included observations retrieved from the literature to construct the most up to date datasets encompassing their entire distribution range see supplementary material 1 biological data retrieved for our study ranged from 1950 to 2017 recent records since 1990 prevailing 83 2 6 7 over both past 1950 1990 12 2 8 7 and undated observations 4 6 3 6 past or undated records were only considered along the distribution edge when the species presence was confirmed by recent records this precautionary approach avoided over or under predictions of the model due to low quality presence data kramer schadt et al 2013 the observation records pre processing consisted in a data cleaning procedure applied on each species dataset to i remove unreliable observations e g preserved specimen newbold 2010 and false identifications e g taxonomic confusion ii discard duplicate occurrences and iii ensure the temporal and locational reliability at the edge of the observed distribution e g data on land longitudinal and or latitudinal inversion historical or undated data according to the ecology of spfs species cannot be observed below 300 m depth checkley et al 2009 while remaining permissive a precautionary bathymetry threshold 1000 m was applied to remove inconsistent occurrences following this pre processing we obtained seven clean datasets with a number of observations ranging from 1314 for mediterranean horse mackerel to 24 806 for european sprat for the seven spfs occurrences were aggregated on a 0 1 0 1 spatial grid from 70 n to 70 s and 180 e to 180 w that corresponds to that of environmental parameters 2 1 2 environmental data to calculate the ecological niche sensu hutchinson 1957 of each spf we collected environmental parameters from different databases see table 1 for details environmental parameters values for each spatial grid cell were first calculated for each year and then averaged on the 1990 2017 period the environmental parameters presented in table 1 were retrieved in different spatial resolutions ranging from 0 1 to 0 5 for modelling purpose all variables were therefore interpolated to a 0 1 0 1 grid using a bilinear interpolation in the geographical domain available for all environmental parameters ranging from 70 n to 70 s and 180 e to 180 w 2 2 description of the models we used two approaches to model the potential environmental suitability i e spatialised index between 0 and 1 defined as a probability of presence based on environmental parameters of each spf species over the 1990 2017 period i the non parametric probabilistic ecological niche nppen beaugrand et al 2011 model and ii seven modelling algorithms available within the biomod2 package thuiller et al 2016 the nppen model is a presence only model based on the mahalanobis generalised distance mahalanobis 1936 and on a modified version of the multiple response permutation procedure mrpp mielke et al 1981 the biomod2 framework allows ensemble modelling of species distribution i e an average model of a wide range of algorithms thuiller et al 2009 here seven algorithms were considered i generalised linear model glm ii generalised additive model gam iii generalised boosting model gbm iv artificial neural network ann v flexible discriminant analysis fda vi multiple adaptive regression splines mars and vii random forest rf because the models used in this study have been already described and discussed in several publications e g beaugrand et al 2011 lenoir et al 2011 raybaud et al 2015 for nppen e g thuiller et al 2009 albouy et al 2012 bellard et al 2013 for biomod2 we refer the reader to this literature for further information the algorithms were calibrated using the default parameters in biomod2 optimised for species distribution modelling details in thuiller et al 2016 by including this large range of algorithms within an ensemble model approach we quantified the uncertainty related to the selection of sdms pearson et al 2006 buisson et al 2010 by calculating the standard deviation sd and the coefficient of variation cv among sdm outputs 2 3 data preparation and ensemble model selection 2 3 1 pre selection of the environmental parameters and assessment of multicollinearity to model the ecological niche of the seven spfs we first constructed the full dataset of environmental parameters based on our knowledge of the ecology of spfs a variable selection process fig 1 step 1 was then applied to identify at the species level the most parsimonious dataset that explained each species distribution this process follows the procedure described in leroy et al 2014 and bellard et al 2016 because most of the algorithms especially regression based models such as glm are sensitive to multicollinearity that may distort model estimation dormann et al 2013 relations among environmental parameters were assessed by means of the pearson correlation coefficient using a threshold r 0 7 to reduce the initial environmental matrix when two or more environmental parameters showed correlation values above this threshold only one variable was retained details in supplementary material 2 we subsequently assessed the relative importance of each environmental parameter by sequentially randomising each variable and by calculating the resulting current distribution leroy et al 2014 the variables that best predicted spf distribution were sea surface temperature annual mean sst temperature variability sea surface temperature annual range or monthly variance depending on the targeted species bathymetry and distance to coast see supplementary material 2 in order to avoid model over parameterisation that affects model performance model transferability and assessment of variable importance we chose not to include bathymetry and distance to coast directly in the models but in a hierarchical filtering approach hattab et al 2014 for a given geographical cell environmental conditions were considered as suitable for a marine species only if a probability of occurrence coincided with a distance to coast less than 50 km or up to a 300 m depth for oceanic cells i e outside the 50 km wide coastal area concerning environmental predictors we systematically considered temperature mean and variability in our models finally we tested the relevance of including sea surface salinity sss and or primary production log pp as a potential third explanatory environmental parameter in the models each run is detailed in supplementary material 3 2 3 2 environmental filtration and pseudo absence selection because sampling effort is neither homogeneous and nor standardised over marine regions occurrence data may not be representative of the whole populations a requirement to increase the reliability of sdms lobo and tognelli 2011 while under sampling is commonly observed at the edge of species range varela et al 2014 observation datasets can also be biased toward regions more comprehensively investigated due to an easy access or a long tradition of monitoring fithian et al 2015 to consider the risk of over sampling and the ensuing over representation of environmental features kramer schadt et al 2013 we first homogenised species datasets to assign the same weight to over and under sampled regions fig 1 step 2 a multidimensional matrix was designed for each species and each combination of environmental parameters a dimension reflecting an environmental factor each cell of the homogenised matrix was considered as an environmental stratum i e a combination of a set of parameters with the following resolution 0 5 c for temperature related parameters 0 5 for sss and 0 5 mol m 2 s 1 in log for primary production in case an environmental stratum contained multiple occurrences only one occurrence i e one 0 1 0 1 geographical cell with the corresponding environmental conditions was kept in the homogenised dataset we also considered the lack of absence data to assess this gap we generated pseudo absences using the convex hull method cornwell et al 2004 getz and wilmers 2006 the convex hull was defined here as the smallest convex hyper volume in the environmental space containing all species observation records a restricted convex hull see fig 2 has been defined as a convex hull excluding occurrence points within the 2 5 and 97 5 percentiles for each environmental parameter i e excluding observations in the most extreme environmental conditions this restricted convex hull is considered as a proxy of the suitable environmental conditions outside which pseudo absences were randomly generated in equal number to the filtered occurrences as recommended by the d designs theory montgomery 2005 the optimal design to minimise prediction variance is when an equal number of observations are at opposite value extremes montgomery 2005 hengl et al 2009 and when there is a high spreading in the feature space finally for each species pseudo absence were projected back in geographical cells showing environmental conditions outside spf species environmentally favourable areas fig 2 varela et al 2014 finally model outputs obtained from our environmental filtration approach were compared with outputs for which neither environmental filtration nor the convex hull pseudo absence selection method was applied fig 3 2 3 3 validation and selection of the best models we then quantified the performance of our models using five commonly used evaluation metrics i the continuous boyce index cbi hirzel et al 2006 a metric specifically designed for presence only models and insensitive to pseudo absences ii the area under the curve auc swets 1988 fielding and bell 1997 iii the true skill statistic tss allouche et al 2006 iv the jaccard and v the sørensen similarity indices jaccard 1908 sørensen 1948 however because all evaluation metrics except the cbi require both presence and absence data see discussion in leroy et al 2018 about the use of pseudo absence to evaluate the performance of models and because some may be affected by prevalence i e the ratio between the number of observed presence and generated pseudo absence leroy et al 2018 we based our selection process of the best models on cbi values only we considered models to be wrong when cbi values were below 0 5 average to random for values ranging from 0 5 to 0 5 and good for values above 0 5 faillettaz et al 2019 for each model we computed evaluation metrics by performing a cross validation procedure with 10 repetitions we randomly sampled 70 of the occurrence data to calibrate the model and kept the remaining 30 for model validation merow et al 2013 following the evaluation strip method detailed by elith et al 2005 the adequacy between observed and modelled spatial distributions was also assessed by means of response curves for a given environmental parameter the corresponding response curve was calculated while keeping the other parameters constant i e at the mean value corresponding to their occurrence points by doing this we identified spurious results e g we do not expect bimodal responses to temperature and or unexpected distribution ranges e g large portions of predicted range in regions where the species has never been observed and vice versa supplementary material 4 3 results 3 1 sdms and parameters selected in the ensemble models based on the calculation of the cbi values and the examination of species response curves supplementary material 3 and 4 we identified the best models for each spf species our results showed that both glm and nppen models were almost always selected in the ensemble model except for the european anchovy ensemble models showed that temperature related variables were essential to assess the spatial distribution of spfs for virtually all species the models that considered mean temperature and variability showed high ability to reproduce the overall spfs distributions table 2 supplementary material 3 with cbi values always above 0 5 faillettaz et al 2019 however some discrepancies were observed among species while mediterranean horse mackerel atlantic horse mackerel and european anchovy distributions were more related to mean monthly temperature variance sstvar european pilchard round sardinella european sprat and bogue distributions were better reproduced when mean annual temperature range sstr was considered despite the high correlation between sstr and sstvar r 0 80 supplementary material 2 both variables have dissimilar ecological influences seasonality versus short term climatic variability respectively primary production also emerged as important to model species spatial distribution finally we highlighted the important role of sea surface salinity sss for both european pilchard and european anchovy by discriminating both the baltic and the black seas from other regions table 2 by applying our environmental filtration framework we substantially improved the modelling of most of the spfs spatial distributions fig 3 individual contributions of the filtration process and the convexhull are presented in supplementary material 5 except for the european pilchard fig 3b specifically we observed an increase in mean cbi values that ranged from 0 05 to 0 23 fig 3 for most spfs lower environmental suitability index esi values were obtained 0 2 without filtration to 0 6 with filtration suggesting that our procedure alleviated the risk of over prediction especially in the black and baltic seas and beyond 60 n where species have never been observed fig 4 left panels by increasing esi values from 0 4 to 0 6 environmental filtration also emphasised regions known to be highly suitable for spf species but in which occurrences were only scarcely available e g in the eastern mediterranean sea for atlantic horse mackerel round sardinella and bogue fig 4a f and g 3 2 contemporary 1990 2017 environmental suitability of small pelagic fishes we then represented the contemporary 1990 2017 spatial distribution of the seven spfs in the spatial domain ranging from 10 to 70 n and from 30 w to 45 e fig 4 middle panel environmental suitabilities at the calibration range i e the entire distribution range are provided in supplementary material 6 according to the observed and modelled distributions fig 4 left and middle panels two species groups were identified with respect to their environmental suitability along the european coasts the first group encompassed temperate to cold water species hereafter temperate cold species i e atlantic horse mackerel european pilchard european sprat and european anchovy fig 4a d that were more likely to be present in northern europe the second grouped temperate to warm water species hereafter temperate warm species i e mediterranean horse mackerel round sardinella and bogue fig 4e g located along the mediterranean coasts down to north africa the four temperate cold species showed the highest esi values in the north sea in the celtic sea in the bay of biscay esi values 0 8 and to a lesser extent along norwegian coasts esi values ranging from 0 2 to 0 8 for all temperate cold species but european pilchard high esi values from 0 4 to 0 8 were expected in the western and central regions of the baltic sea fig 4 suggesting that these species can tolerate a wide salinity range from 8 to 38 and a high thermal variability up to 20 c annual range all temperate cold species but european sprat showed high esi values from 0 6 to 0 8 in the north western part of the mediterranean basin fig 4 for all temperate cold species the modelled esis are in accordance with the observation data except in southern iceland western norway and to a lesser extent in the eastern black sea where positive esi values between 0 05 to 0 6 are predicted while no observed distribution is available the three temperate warm species showed the highest esi values from 0 4 to 0 8 in nearly all the regions of the mediterranean sea and medium to low esi values from 0 2 to 0 7 in the black sea and along the north western african coasts however some discrepancies among species were detected fig 4 round sardinella appears as the most southern spf species with no suitable conditions north of the portuguese coast on the contrary mediterranean horse mackerel and bogue showed high esi values from 0 6 to 0 8 along the atlantic coasts from the celtic sea down to northern africa up to 0 8 in the bay of biscay while bogue showed maximum esi values 0 8 in the whole mediterranean sea only the north western regions of the mediterranean sea were highly suitable for mediterranean horse mackerel and round sardinella the modelled esis are in accordance with the observation data except in the north sea for mediterranean horse mackerel and bogue and to a lesser extent in the eastern black sea for all temperate warm species these regions highlight positive esi values between 0 05 and 0 6 while no observations are available these discrepancies may result from an absence of sampling in these regions or external factors hindering species establishment despite suitable environmental conditions 3 3 model uncertainties two main sources of uncertainties in projected species distributions were considered in our study i biological uncertainties related to the quality of occurrence datasets and ii numerical uncertainties inherent to the selection of different modelling algorithms pearson et al 2006 buisson et al 2010 standard deviations sd computed for each species from outputs that originated from both selected algorithms and cross validation runs ranged from 0 1 to 0 4 indicating a convergence between models fig 4 right panels the lowest sd values close to 0 2 were found in the north western mediterranean sea for virtually all spfs and in the bay of biscay and in the north sea when temperate cold species were studied fig 4 a d the highest sd values close to 0 4 were observed in the mediterranean sea for mediterranean horse mackerel european pilchard and round sardinella fig 4 e g for all species the coefficient of variation cv supplementary material 7 highlighted very low cv variations 20 towards their centre of distribution in the mediterranean sea for all species and north sea for temperate cold species while showing high variations at the leading or the trailing edge of their distribution up to 100 in the black baltic and the norwegian seas 4 discussion by combining several numerical techniques such as the convex hull method the ensemble models approach and an examination of species response curves in a comprehensive modelling framework we modelled the contemporary 1990 2017 environmental suitability of seven of the most commercially and ecologically important european small pelagic fish by relying on both an understanding of the ecological requirements of species and on the use of innovative statistical tools our framework allowed us to focus only on the best models to improve the way species distribution modelling is carried out and therefore to produce more robust ecological scenarios at a macroecological level thermal induced effects have been frequently related to latitudinal mean temperature gradients angilletta 2011 while our analysis showed that mean temperature sst had a major influence on species distributions we also revealed the key role of temperature seasonality sstr and short term temperature variations sstvar in shaping distributional ranges table 2 small pelagic fishes are marine ectotherms that mainly depend on external heat sources their body temperature being directly controlled by environmental conditions directly checkley et al 2009 changes in temperature may therefore affect spfs physiological performances i e their fitness perry et al 2005 payne et al 2016 because the relationship between temperature and fitness occurred through species thermal optimum and range and because spfs are short lifespan species checkley et al 2009 annual temperature changes may affect several life stages especially reproduction and larval development e g peck et al 2013 with long term consequences on population dynamics fréon et al 2005 small pelagic fishes may also experience ontogenetic shifts in thermal tolerance during their development peck et al 2013 and temperature seasonality here sstr may either favour or perturb species development with potential consequences on distributional patterns fig 4 middle panels peck et al 2013 this is especially noticeable in regions characterised by an important thermal variability such as in the black and azov seas in the northern adriatic sea in the baltic sea and to a lesser extent in the eastern part of the north sea considering thermal variability in sdms e g the monthly sst variance may therefore help to better define species environmental suitability and to minimise the risk of over prediction at the leading and the trailing edges of their distributions lenoir et al 2011 when used in distribution modelling regression based algorithms such as glm are known to be rather sensitive to environmental sampling bias which may induce type i errors i e false positive with consequences on projected species environmental suitability araújo and guisan 2006 dormann et al 2007 however as for many other species e g boakes et al 2010 commonly available databases of spfs provide a distorted view of their actual distribution because of spatial and temporal bias in species observations e g beck et al 2014 when the time comes to evaluate the quality of biodiversity datasets three major issues have been raised in the literature e g kramer schadt et al 2013 guillera arroita et al 2015 the influence of i prevalence i e the proportion of sites in which the species was recorded as present ii imperfect species detection and iii sampling bias despite an increasing availability of information the biogeographic distribution of most species remain still frequently incomplete bini et al 2006 a shortcoming explained inter alia by heterogeneous sampling effort among surveys or the inaccessibility of some areas for all spf datasets this effect is undeniable when comparing the north western mediterranean sea the bay of biscay the north sea with other european regions fig 4 left panels to lower this issue a plethora of data sources e g standardised scientific surveys biodiversity portals are now available in collaborative databases e g gbif offering more cohesive summaries of species distributions although leading sometimes to enhanced spatial and environmental biases kramer schadt et al 2013 beck et al 2014 considering independent distributional data i e from private collections or from the literature beck et al 2013 along with the associated pre processing e g kramer schadt et al 2013 varela et al 2014 aiello lammens et al 2015 fithian et al 2015 can contribute to cover the ecological niches of species more comprehensively and to improve model accuracy by coupling these procedures with our restricting convex hull pseudo absence selection we i assigned the same weight to environmental conditions independently of the observation density i e alleviating observation sampling bias ii lowered the weight of presence records at the distribution edge i e avoiding the risk of over prediction and iii selected unbiased pseudo absence i e independent of the observation bias applying environmental filtering and the restricted convexhull pseudo absence selection method resulted in ensemble models characterised by a reduced esi in over sampled areas and an increased esi in undersampled areas our results are consistent with our expectations and in line with previous studies that suggested that random generation of pseudo absences and or a selection process based on geographical criterion may lead to lower predictability e g wisz and guisan 2009 hattab et al 2014 although real absences lead to higher model accuracy wisz and guisan 2009 they are rarely available boakes et al 2010 and determining the location of pseudo absences on the basis of a statistical analysis such as the convex hull is a reliable alternative hattab et al 2013 finally our approach limits spurious species response curves i e overfitted or bimodal curves supplementary material 4 and decreases the risk of over predictions towards the edge of the species range we acknowledge that we may have slightly underpredicted the european pilchard distribution in kattegat i e strait between denmark and sweden the high amount of occurrence records slightly outside the modelled distribution in this region may have biased the calculation of the cbi despite the well known robustness of this index breiner et al 2015 faillettaz et al 2019 our result highlight that no evaluation metric is optimal and that both comparison between observed and modelled distributions and examination of species responses curves are essential for assessing the reliability of model outputs while the assessment of the environmental suitability for a given species may differ slightly or markedly from one sdm to another pearson et al 2006 buisson et al 2010 it is still challenging to identify the most appropriate model see discussion in buisson et al 2010 even if several methods have been recently proposed no consensus has emerged see discussion in leroy et al 2018 and the use of different well fitted and evaluated sdms may help to better simulate potential species distributions for past contemporary and future environmental conditions araújo and new 2007 in complementarity with a multi sdm approach we think that researchers should examine species response curves during the evaluation process e g elith and leathwick 2009 jarnevich et al 2018 erauskin extramiana et al 2019 as observed for mediterranean horse mackerel see details in supplementary material 4 we invalidated response curves that were statistically significant but not in agreement with the ecological niche theory without this complementary evaluation method the corresponding algorithms would have been considered in the ensemble model therefore potentially resulting in spurious patterns of esis therefore this multi criteria evaluation procedure is of great interest from a i numerical i e metric adapted to presence only datasets and an ecological i e validation of the species environment relationships perspective note that the seven spfs we chose are representative of a large spectrum of environmental conditions from temperate to cold waters e g european sprat to temperate to warm waters e g bogue and round sardinella to conclude our framework has been faced with a wide range of environmental conditions allowing us to better evaluate its robustness sensitivity and possible transferability to other species and ecosystems in this work we have estimated species potential niche and not the realised niche soberón and nakamura 2009 we caution that additional environmental parameters biological interactions and species life traits e g dispersal abilities may explain why we detected environmentally suitable conditions in regions where spfs were not observed e g the norwegian sea pulliam 2000 pearman et al 2008 considering the role of biotic interactions in shaping species distributions chaalali et al 2016 would improve the reliability of sdms outputs by better estimating and simulating the realised niche of species wisz et al 2013 louthan et al 2015 including dispersal mechanisms while accounting for oceanic currents and physical barriers after the potential distribution modelling step may help to refine the distributional range of species engler and guisan 2009 these approaches require an exhaustive ecological understanding of the interaction process at a macroecological scale and a deep knowledge of species life traits to implement metrics that simulate the ability of species to disperse e g petitgas et al 2012 moreover it is important to notice that no direct correlations between esi potential or realised and spatialised biomass or official catches have been established in the literature although temporal correlations have been suggested however e g chaalali et al 2016 therefore discrepancies between spf s esi biomass and official catches e g fao 2016 may be explained by population related parameters e g recruitment growth biotic interaction or management policies and stock status e g under or over fishing respectively finally inter specific absolute esi comparison is challenging because of the monospecific nature of sdms our study presents a detailed environmental suitability assessment of seven of the most heavily harvested european spfs by focusing on the most common sources of errors and uncertainties in sdms we designed a comprehensive fully transferable to other species and ecosystems modelling framework which is intended to elaborate more robust ecological scenarios our framework addressed several critical steps in sdms i e the treatment of sampling biases in observation records the generation relevant pseudo absences and a dual assessment of model outputs that proposes to evaluate models from both a numerical and an ecological perspective in a conservation decision making perspective these different steps are essential to increase confidence in sdms a prerequisite to propose effective resource management measures e g accounting for environmental stress or to measure the effectiveness of protected areas e g regarding environmental resilience moreover when used in combination with scenarios of future environmental conditions i e ipcc climate scenarios this framework provides robust contemporary predictions to assess possible changes in species distribution in the context of global climate change despite the growing literature on the development and testing of new modelling and evaluation processes the use of sdms in quantitative resource management and scientific surveys is still a great challenge funding this work was supported by the prince albert ii of monaco foundationthrough the project clim eco²

24936,eutrophication of lakes and wetlands resulting from the discharge of excess nutrients has become a matter of primary concern the entire ecology of a eutrophic wetland gets severely affected due to the substantial degradation of its water quality formulation of ecological models assists in determining the nutrient dynamics of a particular ecosystem thereby providing an idea of the significant causative parameters aiding eutrophication the present study aims at providing a suitable foundation for the development of an eutrophic ecological model for deepor beel india water sediment and water hyacinth samples were collected from various parts of the wetland and subjected to analyses on a continuous basis from oct 2017 to feb 2019 the collected samples were analysed for various physico chemical parameters quintessential for the development of a eutrophication based ecological model a conceptual diagram was first constructed and the corresponding differential equations about different functions were formulated subsequently a code was developed in matlab based on the logic formulated through the conceptual diagram sensitivity analysis was first performed on various state variables identifying the parameters most sensitive and thus exhibiting maximum variability in the model the model was then subjected to calibration for defining the rate constants based on which it was subjected to further validation finally the model was simulated for two plausible alternatives to verify the reduction of the eutrophication levels in deepor beel i harvesting of water hyacinths and ii setting up of a treatment unit for nitrogen and phosphorus removal the results obtained for both cases indicated that harvesting of water hyacinths would not provide a suitable long term and effective solution however setting up of a treatment unit for phosphorus and nitrogen removal can aid in a significant reduction in the nutrient levels in the wetland thereby assisting in curbing the eutrophication levels the results obtained through this study would provide significant assistance to the various government as well as private agencies and policymakers for carrying out effective solutions for the increasing eutrophication levels in deepor beel which would thereby help in reviving the wetland keywords wetlands deepor beel nutrient dynamics eutrophication ecological model

introduction the rise in global population has compromised the environment especially water bodies to a significant extent rapidly decreasing agricultural covers as a result of the exploding population has led to the adaptation of newer technologies and intensification of agricultural land use with the application of chemical fertilizers for improving productivity janssen et al 2017 this has resulted in an increased nutrient rich agro wastewater discharge into the surface waters furthermore the release of untreated or partially treated domestic or industrial wastewaters has also magnified the nutrient loadings in the water bodies thereby increasing their eutrophication levels the rise in eutrophication levels has been a challenge for environmentalists as this leads to lowering of the dissolved oxygen do levels excessive growth of phytoplankton and an increased frequency of algal blooms effects on the drinking water supply food security as well as public health have also been substantial wu et al 2017 wetlands of all the surface water bodies have been a primary victim of the increasing eutrophication levels they act as ecological hotspots serving a wide range of functions flood mitigation groundwater recharge habitat to various species of flora and fauna and carbon sequestration davis 1994 engelhardt and ritchie 2001 fretwell et al 1996 however rampant urbanization combined with industrialization and development in agricultural practices have put enormous pressure on these ecological hotspots leading to large scale deterioration pal and akoma 2009 xie et al 2010 therefore various ecological monitoring programs including monitoring of water quality on a continuous scale has become quintessential for assessing the possible factors responsible for the deterioration of the wetlands alberto et al 2001 however such monitoring programs only provide information regarding the current states of the wetlands and vaguely reflect on the influential parameters and variables responsible for the changes in the wetland ecology this necessitates the formulation of ecological models which can be used to comprehend nutrient cycles identify the various characteristics of the concerned parameter or highlight the underlying process mechanism hu 2016 they are also used to predict the fate of nutrients in the natural ecosystem revealing the extent and means by which the nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus are transformed or removed different researchers have applied ecological models with varying degrees of complexity depending on the nature of the problem available datasets for calibration and validation and skillset of the researchers dejak et al 1987 drago et al 2001 he et al 2011 hongping and yong 2003 hu et al 1998 janssen et al 2017 li kun et al 2017 mccullough et al 2018 rukhovets et al 2003 taguchi and nakata 2009 trolle et al 2008 wang et al 2019 wu et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 a study of different ecological models developed across the world has provided significant insights into the process of ecological modelling along with the extent to which ecological models can be utilised effectively the need to develop an ecological model for a water body becomes far more urgent if it is currently endangered one such case is deepor beel a wetland located in assam india which is under significant existential threat like many other wetlands in the world despite taking several counter measures deepor beel continues to degrade on account of large scale encroachment heavy siltation from the denuded hills surrounding it accumulation of various types of waste including municipal wastewater and leaching from municipal dumping grounds invasion of aquatic weeds industrial development within the wetland and construction of railway lines along some parts of the periphery this has raised serious concerns due to its vast ecological significance although water from deepor beel is not used as a source for water supply the accumulation of waste in the wetland s periphery leads to bioaccumulation in many higher organisms thus affecting the higher trophic levels as well bhattacharyya and kapil 2010 while different studies have been done on deepor beel but no attempt has been made to develop an ecological model and understand the underlying processes responsible for eutrophication in the lake in this perspective the primary objectives of the present study include i developing a one dimensional ecological model to understand the nutrient dynamics in deepor beel and thereby providing insights into the eutrophication process in the lake ii investigating the effects of harvesting plants at different harvesting rates on nutrient dynamics and consequently on the eutrophication process and iii investigating the effects of setting up a treatment plant at the inlet of deepor beel on the nutrient dynamics and consequently on the eutrophication process 2 materials and methodologies 2 1 study area lying in the centre of guwahati city deepor beel fig 1 exists as a site of international importance it acts as a channel connecting the river brahmaputra with the sola beel and the swampy areas of pandu bhattacharyya and kapil 2010 the major water sources for the wetland include the basistha river lying to the south eastern bank the basistha river however gets its water from the bharulu river which flows through guwahati once a source of potable water for the city this tributary of brahmaputra has transformed into a drainage channel receiving a significant amount of city s municipal and other wastes together with storm water runoffs mozumder et al 2014 this makes the wetland vulnerable to contamination especially during monsoon eutrophication of the wetland has been a major concern lately various nutrient contaminations from different sources of pollution have led to a large scale eutrophication problem restoration of the wetland requires exploring the probable aspects of pollution of the wetland which needs continuous monitoring based on the reconnaissance survey of the area 23 sampling sites were selected based on a variety of factors such as accessibility of the sampling sites and their proximity to probable sources of pollution 2 2 sampling strategy and data acquisition water and sediment samples were collected from 23 sampling sites and subsequently analysed water hyacinth was chosen as the representative of the plant samples as they were the dominant species in the wetland hence they were collected from different sites within the wetland the sampling area for the collection of plant samples was divided into three zones due to the mobile nature of water hyacinths fig 2 zone 1 is located to the south eastern part of the wetland and adjacent to the landfill site zone 2 lies in the middle closer to the agricultural fields and zone 3 to the south western part where majority of industries are located sampling was carried out from october 2017 to february 2019 monthly water samples were collected for analysis of seven parameters ph dissolved oxygen do total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn ammonia organic nitrogen nitrate and phosphate while monthly samples of the water hyacinths and sediments were collected for the analysis of five parameters organic nitrogen total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn ammonia nitrate and total phosphorus all the procedures pertaining to the sampling preservation and collection of various samples adhered to the standard procedures apha 2012 for the development of model different data relating to deepor beel such as rainfall evaporation discharge in basistha river productivity of water hyacinth nutrients concentration in the inflowing water and depth of water in the wetland were collected either from literature or field measurements and the same have been reported in supplementary materials section 2 3 model conceptualisation the conceptual diagram for the one dimensional ecological model for nutrient distribution in the wetland ecosystem is given in fig 3 the model is divided into three levels plant layer water column and sediment layer eight state variables are considered for the model organic nitrogen ammonia nitrogen nitrate nitrogen and total phosphorus orgn nh3n no3n and p in the water column total nitrogen and total phosphorus in sediment layer referred to as sediment nitrogen and sediment phosphorus sn and sp respectively total nitrogen and total phosphorus in plant layer referred to as plant nitrogen and plant phosphorus pn and pp respectively orgn in the water column transforms into nh3n that further transforms into no3n by the processes called ammonification and nitrification no3n further converts into nitrogen gas due to denitrification metcalf and eddy 2017 orgn also settles down on the sediment layer which undergoes mineralization to transform into nh3n that gets suspended to re enter the water column again nh3n and no3n are consumed by microorganisms assisting in the conversion of these compounds back into orgn plants consume nh3n and no3n through its roots along with the microbial biofilm developed over its root surface eventually when the plants die nutrients are returned back into the water column as orgn total phosphorus in the water column also settle down on the lake bottom and consumed by roots of the plants which later re enter the water column by resuspension and plant decay respectively the following assumptions were taken into account while developing the conceptualising the model nitrogen in the water is assumed to exist in only three forms organic nitrogen ammonia nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen as the lake remains largely in aerobic conditions other forms of nitrogen such as nitrite nitrogen is considered to be in negligible concentrations and hence not considered while formulating the conceptual diagram similarly phosphorus in water is usually present in the form of phosphates metcalf and eddy 2017 hence phosphates in water is considered representative of total phosphorus in water uniform water depth is considered across the lake and the variation in concentration of different state variables and forcing functions along the depth is overlooked keeping in view the one dimensional nature of the model maximum plant nitrogen and plant phosphorus that can be present in the biomass of water hyacinth are 10 000 g m2 day and 2500 g m2 day respectively the average productivity of water hyacinth is assumed 50 g dry mass m2 day over the entire surface of deepor beel and has been assumed to have a sinusoidal variation such that higher productivity occurs in the winter while lower productivity occurs in the monsoon peak productivity is assumed to be 53 g dry mass m2 day based on the observations made by reddy and tucker 1983 the depth of sediment layer in the lake is assumed be 0 3 m van dam et al 2007 it is assumed that the mixing of the nutrients in the lake takes place immediately as advection and diffusion of the nutrients are not considered in the one dimensional model the following generalised symbolic mass balance equation was used as the basis for developing various equations in the model 1 v d c d t q i c i v j 1 m r c j q e c e where v d c d t is the volumetric rate of change of substance in the reactor g day q i and q e represent the inflowing and outflowing flow rate respectively m3 day v is reactor volume m3 c i and c e signify the influent and effluent concentrations respectively g m3 r c is volumetric reaction rate g m3 day m is the number of reactions that involve the substance using the concept from eq 1 the model equations for the rate of change of different parameters were formulated organic nitrogen 2 d o r g n d t r o r g n i r n d c r m u 1 r m u

by the microorganisms for growth can be taken as a function of temperature ammonia nitrogen and organic nitrogen present in the water column hence it was represented as follows 5 r m u 1 f t n h 3 o r g n this function can be assumed to follow the monod kinetic equation for ammonia nitrogen with the incorporation of plant biofilm in it polprasert and agarwalla 1994 the temperature factor can be incorporated by considering the arrhenius kinetics as it might be possible that microorganisms may prefer to feed on ammonia nitrogen over nitrate nitrogen a preference factor p1 can also be incorporated mayo and bigambo 2005 thus the rate of ammonia uptake by the microorganisms can be given by eq 6 6 r m u 1 μ m a x 20 r b θ 1 t 20 n h 3 n k 1 n h 3 n o r g n p 1 similarly the rate of nitrate uptake can be taken as the function of temperature nitrate nitrogen and organic nitrogen eq 3 7 and can be further calculated as eq 8 7 r m u 2 f t n o 3 o r g n 8 r m u 2 μ m a x 20 r b θ 2 t

nitrogen and dissolved oxygen present in the water column mayo and bigambo 2005 correction factors can be applied for ph and temperature respectively 14 r n μ n y n r b n h 3 n k n h n h 3 n d o k n o

s 2 4 sensitivity analysis global sensitivity analysis of the one dimensional ecological model was carried out by oat sampling approach following the method described by morris 1991 in the morris method it is assumed that if the input variables parameters are changed by same relative amount then the input variable which causes the highest variation in the output variable state variable is the most sensitive input variable in the model the morris method is also known as elementary effects method as it calculates the elementary effect of change in input variable positive or negative on the output variable the elementary effect is calculated by eq 37 37 e e i x y x 1 x 2 x i 1 x i δ x i 1 x k y x δ where y is the output variable x is the input vector and x i is an element in the input vector δ is the change in x i and k is the number of elements in the input vector as pointed out by king and perera 2013 the morris method requires 2k simulations of the model to determine the sensitivity of all the input variables in order to carry out sensitivity analysis using morris method a trajectory of changes in the input variables of a k variable model was constructed this was done by considering a normalised range of probable values for each input variable and dividing each range by equal number of intervals or levels base values of the input variables were randomly selected from 0 to δ to mark the starting point of the trajectory the trajectory was then subsequently calculated by the final trajectory matrix b as given by the following equations saltelli et al 2008 38 b j m 1 x δ 2 2 b j m k d j m k p where b is a strictly lower triangular matrix of 1 s j m k is a m by k matrix of 1 s where m k 1 x is the base input vector j m 1 is a column vector of 1 s d is a k dimensional diagonal matrix in which each element is 1 or 1 with same probability p is a k by k random permutation matrix of 0 s and 1 s in which each row contains a solitary 1 and varies from the other rows by the relative position of that 1 the elementary effects were finally measured by two measure given by following equations campolongo et al 2007 morris 1991 39 μ i n 1 r e e n r 40 σ i 1 r n 1 r e e n μ i 2 where 41 μ i n 1 r e e n r and r is the number trajectories constructed during the analysis μ i is the absolute mean of all the elementary effects due to the i t h input variable free of non monotonic behaviour of the elementary effects which provides a measure of the degree of sensitivity of the input variables considered in the analysis high value of this sensitivity index indicates that the output variable is highly sensitive to the input variable considered σ i is the standard deviation of all the elementary effects due to i t h input variable high value of which indicates non linear or interaction of the input variable with other variables of the model 2 5 model calibration and validation calibration of the one dimensional eutrophication model was carried out using the data obtained during the period october 2017 to october 2018 and the model was then validated using the data obtained during the period october 2018 to february 2019 euler rectangular method of integration was employed to solve all the differential equations involved in the model in matlab r2016b version 3 results and discussion 3 1 spatio temporal variations of different water quality plant and sediment samples the various water quality plant and sediment samples have been reported in figs s7 s9 respectively through pattern plots as well as graphs the variation along the horizontal axis for the pattern plots indicates the temporal variation at a particular sampling site across the sampling period similarly the variation along the vertical axis shows the spatial variation for a particular sampling month across all the sampling sites alkaline ph values were observed fig s7 a at sampling sites with marked presence of water hyacinths indicating a possible role photosynthesis by microorganisms present at the root zone on the other hand acidic ph values were observed at sampling points closer to the boragaon dumpsite indicating a probable inflow of acidic surface runoff dissolved oxygen showed wide variation both spatially and temporally across the sampling period fig s7 b it was consistently low for sampling sites 7 9 15 and 16 which are located closest to the boragaon dumpsite occasionally dropping to values lower than 4 mg l which is required to support aquatic life sampling sites closer to the industrial zone and at the mid section of deepor beel had high dissolved oxygen concentration for most part of the sampling period sampling site 10 showed abnormally high dissolved oxygen concentration in few sampling months which can be explained by the presence of water hyacinths in that area the anomalous high value of total kjeldahl nitrogen at sampling sites 15 and 16 can be explained by the proximity of those points to boragaon dumpsite in fact the total kjeldahl nitrogen at all the sampling points was relatively high in the month of march 2018 this can be attributed to the fact that total kjeldahl nitrogen in the inflowing water of basistha river was high for that month fig s7 c the ammonia nitrogen concentration fig s7 d was higher in the winter and pre monsoon seasons than in monsoon and post monsoon seasons this trend can be due to factors such dilution due to increased water volume higher nitrification rate higher microbial uptake etc it is also interesting to note that most of the high nitrate sampling sites fig s7 f are located close to the banks of lake hinting at the possibility of artificial addition of nitrate from the agricultural runoff the average temperature of the water in deepor beel was higher during the pre monsoon and monsoon period may to september as shown in fig s7 h high temperature during this period is a reflection of the high ambient temperature that prevails in the region fig s8 represents the spatio temporal variation of different nutrients in plants in deepor beel tkn and orgn show similar trends as indicated by fig s8 a and c water hyacinths in deepor beel begin to bloom in the post monsoon season and attain maturity in the succeeding seasons this explains the initial rise in tkn and orgn in the zones 1 and 3 the trends then continue to stay mostly constant from february 2018 to july 2018 as most of the water hyacinths during that period in the lake achieve maturation stage and hence lower concentrations are observed in the plant biomass nh3n no3n and pp are found to be present in lower concentrations in the wetland similarly the spatio temporal variations of the nutrient concentrations in the deepor beel have been represented in fig s9 through pattern plots high concentration in green zone fig s9a can be explained by higher settling rate during that period which can be validated by the fact that tkn in the water column decreased around the same period ammonia nitrogen fig s9b is present in low concentration in the sediments as it quickly dissolves into pore water and re enters the water column under favourable situations however on an average nh3n in the sediments was higher around the same period as tkn hinting at increased rate of ammonification of the orgn present in the sediments no3n is mostly present in trace concentrations in the wetland fig s9d while sp varies over a wide range from 0 01 0 6 mg g fig s9e 3 2 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analyses of the elementary effects for different state variables corresponding to different parameters are shown in fig 4 a h these figures indicate scatter plots between standard deviation σ and absolute mean μ the plots of these statistical indicators through morris method recognises the input functions having a significant influence with respect to different parameters low mean and low standard deviation negligible high mean and low standard deviation linear and additive high standard deviation non linear or involved in interactions with other input parameters all the plots have been constructed for a confidence limit of 10 clearly from fig 4a μn is a dominating factor responsible for maximum variation of organic nitrogen in water with respect to other input factors since it has a high standard deviation factors such as μmax 20 ram rb and rns have lower standard deviation values which signifies that they have a linear and additive effect on the other input parameters factors other than these have low mean and low standard deviation values which suggests that their effects on the input factors are negligible similarly fig 4b suggest that μ n has the highest impact for ammonia nitrogen in water accounting for the maximum variability with respect to other parameters while ram rb have a considerably high standard deviation as compared to the absolute mean which indicates non linear behaviour involving interactions with other input parameters similar trends is represented for nitrate nitrogen fig 4c where μ n plays a significant role in the variability of the input parameters as compared to other input factors while other factors have a negligible effect on the variability however for plant nitrogen there exist two factors μmpu1 and μmpu2 which show significant influence as compared to other parameters fig 4d this shows that the maximum uptake by plants for both ammonia and nitrate respectively play significant role in variability of the input parameters while other factors have negligible influence fig 4e represents the effects of sediment nitrogen in relation to other parameters μ n is the only parameter which shows a non linear effect on the variability of the parameter rns and rnrs show higher mean values with small standard deviation range which indicates a linear and additive effect on the variability total phosphorus in water and sediment phosphorus fig 4f g show similar behaviours for all the corresponding parameters where rprs has a significant influence on the variability on the other hand the elementary effects on plant phosphorus indicate that rpdc and μmppu show a linear influence while rprs shows a non linear influence with other input parameters 3 3 calibration and validation of the model based on the sensitivity analysis model calibration of different parameters were carried out using first twelve months of sampling data the calibrated model was then validated with the remaining five months of sampling data the initial values of the state variables that were used in the model during calibration are given in table 1 the values of the state variables are expressed in g m2 day the calibrated value of the parameters are shown in table 2 along with the literature range obtained from different sources figs 5 and 6 represent the plots between simulated versus observed parameters of the model for calibration and validation respectively excellent agreements between the modelled output and the actual observations indicated the effectiveness of the model in predicting the actual behaviours of the model parameters with respect to the actual natural conditions some of the important observations made are described below organic nitrogen in water column observed average organic nitrogen in the water column decreases in the winter season and rises as the monsoon approaches and peaks in the month of august 2018 304th day the simulated average organic nitrogen in the water column has been able to mimic such a trend fig 5a this is mainly attributed to the fact that the discharge from the basistha river is maximum during this period thus influencing heavy discharge of nutrients into the wetland the reaction rates involved in the sub model also behave in a similar manner as the simulated average organic nitrogen trend however the decay rate of plant nitrogen is observed to have the least effect on the organic nitrogen sub model ammonia nitrogen in water column the average ammonia nitrogen in the water column reduces to the minimum in the month of may 2018 212th day beyond which it rises again fig 5b inflowing and outflowing ammonia nitrogen concentration has little role to play in the variation of the simulated data which is largely affected by ammonification and microbial uptake nitrification and resuspension of sediment nitrogen also plays a decent role in such variations the rate of ammonia utilization by plants for growth had the minimum impact on the state variable nitrate nitrogen in water column nitrate nitrogen in the water column remains considerably low till june 2018 243rd day beyond which it quickly spikes to high values in the months of july and august 2018 fig 5c this is mainly because nitrification and inflowing nitrate nitrogen had significant contributions to the simulated data variation whereas plant uptake played a minimal role plant nitrogen the simulated average plant nitrogen in deepor beel showed high correlation with the observed average plant nitrogen fig 5d the reaction rates involved in the sub model are relatively very low compared to the reaction rates in other sub models the decay rate of plant nitrogen appears to be constant in comparison to ammonia and nitrate uptake rates which dominates the slight variations observed in the simulated data sediment nitrogen simulated average sediment nitrogen in deepor beel is assumed to be regulated by two reaction rates settling rate of organic nitrogen and ammonia regeneration rate the one dimensional ecological model has been mostly successful is predicting the variation of observed average sediment nitrogen using this simple assumption fig 5e total phosphorus in water column the average total phosphorus in water column remained low in the initial simulation period until may 2018 212rd day beyond which it spiked rapidly to reach the highest observed average total phosphorus concentration in the month of july 2018 273rd day fig 5f this sub model appears to be largely affected by the inflowing and outflowing concentrations of total phosphorus while other reaction rates seem to have negligible influence plant phosphorus the simulated average plant phosphorus appears to be fairly correlated to the observed average plant phosphorus fig 5g the reaction rates involved in the sub model have very low values due to which they failed to have any significant impact on other sub models but the in this sub model both the reactions had equal dominance sediment phosphorus the observed average sediment phosphorus appears to rise rapidly post june 2018 243rd day which has been successfully simulated by the model fig 5h in this state variable the rate of settling of phosphorus plays a significant role in regulating the variation of the simulated data but the delayed peak in the simulated reflects the considerable effect of sediment phosphorus resuspension rate the output of the model during validation was subjected to regression analysis to obtain the rmse and coefficient of determination r2 values for each state variable table 3 good agreement was observed between the simulated data and observed data for all the state variables organic nitrogen ammonia nitrogen and total phosphorus in water showed very high correlation r2 0 95 while nitrate nitrogen sediment nitrogen and plant nitrogen showed slightly lower correlation r2 0 8 0 9 sediment phosphorus and plant nitrogen showed least correlation among all the state variables r2 0 7705 and 0 6260 respectively but considering the natural system such low values of correlation of determination are considered acceptable arhonditsis and brett 2005 the outcomes of the model during validation are present in fig 6a h 3 4 plausible role of harvesting of plants in deepor beel the effects of harvesting of water hyacinths in deepor beel on different types of nutrients is shown in fig 7 a h the model was designed to check the behaviour of all the state variables when the plants in the lake were subjected to no harvesting as well as to three hypothetical harvesting rates 80 90 and 100 as evident from the graphs harvesting of plants had little effect on the nutrients in different levels except for plant nitrogen and plant phosphorus which is obvious as the removal of plants from the ecosystem will also remove the nitrogen and phosphorus compounds attached to it the other state variables however remain unaffected from harvesting as the rates of ammonia nitrogen and phosphorus utilization by the plants for growth as well as rates of plant nitrogen and phosphorus decay are significantly low in comparison to other reaction rates involved in the respective sub models this also explains the temporary nature of the harvesting in weed control of water hyacinth as the nutrients in the lake remain intact even after harvesting barely removing the plants from the lake could not prevent the plants from resurfacing in the future therefore harvesting of plants in deepor beel will not be an effective measure in controlling the eutrophication in the lake 3 5 plausible role of a treatment unit in deepor beel the treatment of inflowing water to deepor beel is found to have a significant impact on the state variables of the model fig 8 a h organic nitrogen in the lake rapidly decreases on introducing a treatment unit in the lake and reduction further intensifies with higher treatment efficiencies fig 8a ammonia nitrogen in the lake also decreases but such decreases are not as drastic as decreases in organic nitrogen fig 8b however similar to the organic nitrogen ammonia nitrogen decreases more with increase in treatment efficiency nitrate nitrogen in deepor beel also decreases rapidly and increasing the treatment efficiencies leads to smoothening of the temporal variation of average nitrate nitrogen in deepor beel fig 8c the treatment unit does not have any significant effect on plant nitrogen initially but in the later part of the simulation plant nitrogen shows considerable incremental decrease with incremental increase in treatment efficiency fig 8d the widening gap between the trends of plant nitrogen without treatment and with treatment in the later stages of simulation indicates a possibility of permanent decrease in plant nitrogen in the future the sediment nitrogen in deepor beel also decreases when a treatment unit is introduced in the lake and further smoothens out when the treatment efficiency is increased fig 8e the phosphorus components also behave similar to the nitrogen counterparts when a treatment unit is introduced in deepor beel 4 conclusion the present study was conducted to develop a one dimensional ecological model for deepor beel in order to understand the fate of nutrients and thereby develop a better understanding of the eutrophication process in the wetland the major outcomes of this study are listed as follows the one dimensional ecological model developed in this study has been successful in predicting the distribution of nutrients in different state variables identified in deepor beel the rmse and r2 values of all the state variables lied in the range 0 0001265 2 0220 and 0 6260 0 9979 respectively during model validation and thereby substantiating the successful behaviour of the model the calibrated model provided interesting insights to the behaviour of the state variables it has eloquently highlighted the fact that rates of nutrient uptake by plants are considerably low to have any effect on the behaviour of the state variables other than those related to plants the model has also explained the lesser dependence of ammonia nitrogen state variable on the inflowing and outflowing ammonia nitrogen for variation it has also revealed the dominant role of rate of nitrification as well as inflowing and outflowing concentration of different nutrients on different state variables the application of the model to study the effects of harvesting the plants from deepor beel at different harvesting rates has successfully corroborated the fact that harvesting of plants is merely a temporary solution to the eutrophication problem as the nutrients in the water column remain nearly intact during harvesting simulation the nutrient uptake rates as well as decay rates of plants are considerably low to have any pronounced effect on other state variables even when the complete harvesting simulation of the plants was carried out finally the model predicted that introduction of a treatment unit to deepor beel such that the water entering the lake is partially treated before entry can be very effective in eutrophication abatement in the lake the nutrient concentration significantly decreased in the water column during simulation and growth of plants also decreased the diverging trends of plant nitrogen without harvesting and with harvesting indicated a possible decrease in the plant population if the treatment unit is operational for a long period declaration of competing interest none appendix a supplementary data supplementary material related to this article can be found in the online version at doi https doi

24936,eutrophication of lakes and wetlands resulting from the discharge of excess nutrients has become a matter of primary concern the entire ecology of a eutrophic wetland gets severely affected due to the substantial degradation of its water quality formulation of ecological models assists in determining the nutrient dynamics of a particular ecosystem thereby providing an idea of the significant causative parameters aiding eutrophication the present study aims at providing a suitable foundation for the development of an eutrophic ecological model for deepor beel india water sediment and water hyacinth samples were collected from various parts of the wetland and subjected to analyses on a continuous basis from oct 2017 to feb 2019 the collected samples were analysed for various physico chemical parameters quintessential for the development of a eutrophication based ecological model a conceptual diagram was first constructed and the corresponding differential equations about different functions were formulated subsequently a code was developed in matlab based on the logic formulated through the conceptual diagram sensitivity analysis was first performed on various state variables identifying the parameters most sensitive and thus exhibiting maximum variability in the model the model was then subjected to calibration for defining the rate constants based on which it was subjected to further validation finally the model was simulated for two plausible alternatives to verify the reduction of the eutrophication levels in deepor beel i harvesting of water hyacinths and ii setting up of a treatment unit for nitrogen and phosphorus removal the results obtained for both cases indicated that harvesting of water hyacinths would not provide a suitable long term and effective solution however setting up of a treatment unit for phosphorus and nitrogen removal can aid in a significant reduction in the nutrient levels in the wetland thereby assisting in curbing the eutrophication levels the results obtained through this study would provide significant assistance to the various government as well as private agencies and policymakers for carrying out effective solutions for the increasing eutrophication levels in deepor beel which would thereby help in reviving the wetland keywords wetlands deepor beel nutrient dynamics eutrophication ecological model

introduction the rise in global population has compromised the environment especially water bodies to a significant extent rapidly decreasing agricultural covers as a result of the exploding population has led to the adaptation of newer technologies and intensification of agricultural land use with the application of chemical fertilizers for improving productivity janssen et al 2017 this has resulted in an increased nutrient rich agro wastewater discharge into the surface waters furthermore the release of untreated or partially treated domestic or industrial wastewaters has also magnified the nutrient loadings in the water bodies thereby increasing their eutrophication levels the rise in eutrophication levels has been a challenge for environmentalists as this leads to lowering of the dissolved oxygen do levels excessive growth of phytoplankton and an increased frequency of algal blooms effects on the drinking water supply food security as well as public health have also been substantial wu et al 2017 wetlands of all the surface water bodies have been a primary victim of the increasing eutrophication levels they act as ecological hotspots serving a wide range of functions flood mitigation groundwater recharge habitat to various species of flora and fauna and carbon sequestration davis 1994 engelhardt and ritchie 2001 fretwell et al 1996 however rampant urbanization combined with industrialization and development in agricultural practices have put enormous pressure on these ecological hotspots leading to large scale deterioration pal and akoma 2009 xie et al 2010 therefore various ecological monitoring programs including monitoring of water quality on a continuous scale has become quintessential for assessing the possible factors responsible for the deterioration of the wetlands alberto et al 2001 however such monitoring programs only provide information regarding the current states of the wetlands and vaguely reflect on the influential parameters and variables responsible for the changes in the wetland ecology this necessitates the formulation of ecological models which can be used to comprehend nutrient cycles identify the various characteristics of the concerned parameter or highlight the underlying process mechanism hu 2016 they are also used to predict the fate of nutrients in the natural ecosystem revealing the extent and means by which the nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus are transformed or removed different researchers have applied ecological models with varying degrees of complexity depending on the nature of the problem available datasets for calibration and validation and skillset of the researchers dejak et al 1987 drago et al 2001 he et al 2011 hongping and yong 2003 hu et al 1998 janssen et al 2017 li kun et al 2017 mccullough et al 2018 rukhovets et al 2003 taguchi and nakata 2009 trolle et al 2008 wang et al 2019 wu et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 a study of different ecological models developed across the world has provided significant insights into the process of ecological modelling along with the extent to which ecological models can be utilised effectively the need to develop an ecological model for a water body becomes far more urgent if it is currently endangered one such case is deepor beel a wetland located in assam india which is under significant existential threat like many other wetlands in the world despite taking several counter measures deepor beel continues to degrade on account of large scale encroachment heavy siltation from the denuded hills surrounding it accumulation of various types of waste including municipal wastewater and leaching from municipal dumping grounds invasion of aquatic weeds industrial development within the wetland and construction of railway lines along some parts of the periphery this has raised serious concerns due to its vast ecological significance although water from deepor beel is not used as a source for water supply the accumulation of waste in the wetland s periphery leads to bioaccumulation in many higher organisms thus affecting the higher trophic levels as well bhattacharyya and kapil 2010 while different studies have been done on deepor beel but no attempt has been made to develop an ecological model and understand the underlying processes responsible for eutrophication in the lake in this perspective the primary objectives of the present study include i developing a one dimensional ecological model to understand the nutrient dynamics in deepor beel and thereby providing insights into the eutrophication process in the lake ii investigating the effects of harvesting plants at different harvesting rates on nutrient dynamics and consequently on the eutrophication process and iii investigating the effects of setting up a treatment plant at the inlet of deepor beel on the nutrient dynamics and consequently on the eutrophication process 2 materials and methodologies 2 1 study area lying in the centre of guwahati city deepor beel fig 1 exists as a site of international importance it acts as a channel connecting the river brahmaputra with the sola beel and the swampy areas of pandu bhattacharyya and kapil 2010 the major water sources for the wetland include the basistha river lying to the south eastern bank the basistha river however gets its water from the bharulu river which flows through guwahati once a source of potable water for the city this tributary of brahmaputra has transformed into a drainage channel receiving a significant amount of city s municipal and other wastes together with storm water runoffs mozumder et al 2014 this makes the wetland vulnerable to contamination especially during monsoon eutrophication of the wetland has been a major concern lately various nutrient contaminations from different sources of pollution have led to a large scale eutrophication problem restoration of the wetland requires exploring the probable aspects of pollution of the wetland which needs continuous monitoring based on the reconnaissance survey of the area 23 sampling sites were selected based on a variety of factors such as accessibility of the sampling sites and their proximity to probable sources of pollution 2 2 sampling strategy and data acquisition water and sediment samples were collected from 23 sampling sites and subsequently analysed water hyacinth was chosen as the representative of the plant samples as they were the dominant species in the wetland hence they were collected from different sites within the wetland the sampling area for the collection of plant samples was divided into three zones due to the mobile nature of water hyacinths fig 2 zone 1 is located to the south eastern part of the wetland and adjacent to the landfill site zone 2 lies in the middle closer to the agricultural fields and zone 3 to the south western part where majority of industries are located sampling was carried out from october 2017 to february 2019 monthly water samples were collected for analysis of seven parameters ph dissolved oxygen do total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn ammonia organic nitrogen nitrate and phosphate while monthly samples of the water hyacinths and sediments were collected for the analysis of five parameters organic nitrogen total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn ammonia nitrate and total phosphorus all the procedures pertaining to the sampling preservation and collection of various samples adhered to the standard procedures apha 2012 for the development of model different data relating to deepor beel such as rainfall evaporation discharge in basistha river productivity of water hyacinth nutrients concentration in the inflowing water and depth of water in the wetland were collected either from literature or field measurements and the same have been reported in supplementary materials section 2 3 model conceptualisation the conceptual diagram for the one dimensional ecological model for nutrient distribution in the wetland ecosystem is given in fig 3 the model is divided into three levels plant layer water column and sediment layer eight state variables are considered for the model organic nitrogen ammonia nitrogen nitrate nitrogen and total phosphorus orgn nh3n no3n and p in the water column total nitrogen and total phosphorus in sediment layer referred to as sediment nitrogen and sediment phosphorus sn and sp respectively total nitrogen and total phosphorus in plant layer referred to as plant nitrogen and plant phosphorus pn and pp respectively orgn in the water column transforms into nh3n that further transforms into no3n by the processes called ammonification and nitrification no3n further converts into nitrogen gas due to denitrification metcalf and eddy 2017 orgn also settles down on the sediment layer which undergoes mineralization to transform into nh3n that gets suspended to re enter the water column again nh3n and no3n are consumed by microorganisms assisting in the conversion of these compounds back into orgn plants consume nh3n and no3n through its roots along with the microbial biofilm developed over its root surface eventually when the plants die nutrients are returned back into the water column as orgn total phosphorus in the water column also settle down on the lake bottom and consumed by roots of the plants which later re enter the water column by resuspension and plant decay respectively the following assumptions were taken into account while developing the conceptualising the model nitrogen in the water is assumed to exist in only three forms organic nitrogen ammonia nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen as the lake remains largely in aerobic conditions other forms of nitrogen such as nitrite nitrogen is considered to be in negligible concentrations and hence not considered while formulating the conceptual diagram similarly phosphorus in water is usually present in the form of phosphates metcalf and eddy 2017 hence phosphates in water is considered representative of total phosphorus in water uniform water depth is considered across the lake and the variation in concentration of different state variables and forcing functions along the depth is overlooked keeping in view the one dimensional nature of the model maximum plant nitrogen and plant phosphorus that can be present in the biomass of water hyacinth are 10 000 g m2 day and 2500 g m2 day respectively the average productivity of water hyacinth is assumed 50 g dry mass m2 day over the entire surface of deepor beel and has been assumed to have a sinusoidal variation such that higher productivity occurs in the winter while lower productivity occurs in the monsoon peak productivity is assumed to be 53 g dry mass m2 day based on the observations made by reddy and tucker 1983 the depth of sediment layer in the lake is assumed be 0 3 m van dam et al 2007 it is assumed that the mixing of the nutrients in the lake takes place immediately as advection and diffusion of the nutrients are not considered in the one dimensional model the following generalised symbolic mass balance equation was used as the basis for developing various equations in the model 1 v d c d t q i c i v j 1 m r c j q e c e where v d c d t is the volumetric rate of change of substance in the reactor g day q i and q e represent the inflowing and outflowing flow rate

involve the substance using the concept from eq 1 the model equations for the rate of change of different parameters were formulated organic nitrogen 2 d o r g n d t r o r g n i r n d c r m u 1 r m u

g n this function can be assumed to follow the monod kinetic equation for ammonia nitrogen with the incorporation of plant biofilm in it polprasert and agarwalla 1994 the temperature factor can be incorporated by considering the arrhenius kinetics as it might be possible that microorganisms may prefer to feed on ammonia nitrogen over nitrate nitrogen a preference factor p1 can also be incorporated mayo and bigambo 2005 thus the rate of ammonia uptake by the microorganisms can be given by eq 6 6 r m u 1 μ m a x 20 r b θ 1 t 20 n h 3 n k 1 n h 3 n o r g n p 1 similarly the rate of nitrate uptake can be taken as the function of temperature nitrate nitrogen and organic nitrogen eq 3 7 and can be further calculated as eq 8 7 r m u 2 f t n o 3 o r g n 8 r m u 2 μ m a x 20 r b θ 2 t

s 2 4 sensitivity analysis global sensitivity analysis of the one dimensional ecological model was carried out by oat sampling approach following the method described by morris 1991 in the morris method it is assumed that if the input variables parameters are changed by same relative amount then the input variable which causes the highest variation in the output variable state variable is the most sensitive input variable in the model the morris method is also known as elementary effects method as it calculates the elementary effect of change in input variable positive or negative on the output variable the elementary effect is calculated by eq 37 37 e e i x y x 1 x 2 x i 1 x i δ x i 1 x k y x δ where y is the output variable x is the input vector and x i is an element in the input vector δ is the change in x i and k is the number of elements in the input vector as pointed out by king and perera 2013 the morris method requires 2k simulations of the model to determine the sensitivity of all the input variables in order to carry out sensitivity analysis using morris method a trajectory of changes in the input variables of a k variable model was constructed this was done by considering a normalised range of probable values for each input variable and dividing each range by equal number of intervals or levels base values of the input variables were randomly selected from 0 to δ to mark the starting point of the trajectory the trajectory was then subsequently calculated by the final trajectory matrix b as given by the following equations saltelli et al 2008 38 b j m 1 x δ 2 2 b j m k d j m k p where b is a strictly lower triangular matrix of 1 s j m k is a m by k matrix of 1 s where m k 1 x is the base input vector j m 1 is a column vector of 1 s d is a k dimensional diagonal matrix in which each element is 1 or 1 with same probability p is a k by k random permutation matrix of 0 s and 1 s in which each row contains a solitary 1 and varies from the other rows by the relative position of that 1 the elementary effects were finally measured by two measure given by following equations campolongo et al 2007 morris 1991 39 μ i n 1 r e e n r 40 σ i 1 r n 1 r e e n μ i 2 where 41 μ i n 1 r e e n r and r is the number trajectories constructed during the analysis μ i is the absolute mean of all the elementary effects due to the i t h input variable free of non monotonic behaviour of the elementary effects which provides a measure of the degree of sensitivity of the input variables considered in the analysis high value of this sensitivity index indicates that the output variable is highly sensitive to the input variable considered σ i is the standard deviation of all the elementary effects due to i t h input variable high value of which indicates non linear or interaction of the input variable with other variables of the model 2 5 model calibration and validation calibration of the one dimensional eutrophication model was carried out using the data obtained during the period october 2017 to october 2018 and the model was then validated using the data obtained during the period october 2018 to february 2019 euler rectangular method of integration was employed to solve all the differential equations involved in the model in matlab r2016b version 3 results and discussion 3 1 spatio temporal variations of different water quality plant and sediment samples the various water quality plant and sediment samples have been reported in figs s7 s9 respectively through pattern plots as well as graphs the variation along the horizontal axis for the pattern plots indicates the temporal variation at a particular sampling site across the sampling period similarly the variation along the vertical axis shows the spatial variation for a particular sampling month across all the sampling sites alkaline ph values were observed fig s7 a at sampling sites with marked presence of water hyacinths indicating a possible role photosynthesis by microorganisms present at the root zone on the other hand acidic ph values were observed at sampling points closer to the boragaon dumpsite indicating a probable inflow of acidic surface runoff dissolved oxygen showed wide variation both spatially and temporally across the sampling period fig s7 b it was consistently low for sampling sites 7 9 15 and 16 which are located closest to the boragaon dumpsite occasionally dropping to values lower than 4 mg l which is required to support aquatic life sampling sites closer to the industrial zone and at the mid section of deepor beel had high dissolved oxygen concentration for most part of the sampling period sampling site 10 showed abnormally high dissolved oxygen concentration in few sampling months which can be explained by the presence of water hyacinths in that area the anomalous high value of total kjeldahl nitrogen at sampling sites 15 and 16 can be explained by the proximity of those points to boragaon dumpsite in fact the total kjeldahl nitrogen at all the sampling points was relatively high in the month of march 2018 this can be attributed to the fact that total kjeldahl nitrogen in the inflowing water of basistha river was high for that month fig s7 c the ammonia nitrogen concentration fig s7 d was higher in the winter and pre monsoon seasons than in monsoon and post monsoon seasons this trend can be due to factors such dilution due to increased water volume higher nitrification rate higher microbial uptake etc it is also interesting to note that most of the high nitrate sampling sites fig s7 f are located close to the banks of lake hinting at the possibility of artificial addition of nitrate from the agricultural runoff the average temperature of the water in deepor beel was higher during the pre monsoon and monsoon period may to september as shown in fig s7 h high temperature during this period is a reflection of the high ambient temperature that prevails in the region fig s8 represents the spatio temporal variation of different nutrients in plants in deepor beel tkn and orgn show similar trends as indicated by fig s8 a and c water hyacinths in deepor beel begin to bloom in the post monsoon season and attain maturity in the succeeding seasons this explains the initial rise in tkn and orgn in the zones 1 and 3 the trends then continue to stay mostly constant from february 2018 to july 2018 as most of the water hyacinths during that period in the lake achieve maturation stage and hence lower concentrations are observed in the plant biomass nh3n no3n and pp are found to be present in lower concentrations in the wetland similarly the spatio temporal variations of the nutrient concentrations in the deepor beel have been represented in fig s9 through pattern plots high concentration in green zone fig s9a can be explained by higher settling rate during that period which can be validated by the fact that tkn in the water column decreased around the same period ammonia nitrogen fig s9b is present in low concentration in the sediments as it quickly dissolves into pore water and re enters the water column under favourable situations however on an average nh3n in the sediments was higher around the same period as tkn hinting at increased rate of ammonification of the orgn present in the sediments no3n is mostly present in trace concentrations in the wetland fig s9d while sp varies over a wide range from 0 01 0 6 mg g fig s9e 3 2 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analyses of the elementary effects for different state variables corresponding to different parameters are shown in fig 4 a h these figures indicate scatter plots between standard deviation σ and absolute mean μ the plots of these statistical indicators through morris method recognises the input functions having a significant influence with respect to different parameters low mean and low standard deviation negligible high mean and low standard deviation linear and additive high standard deviation non linear or involved in interactions with other input parameters all the plots have been constructed for a confidence limit of 10 clearly from fig 4a μn is a dominating factor responsible for maximum variation of organic nitrogen in water with respect to other input factors since it has a high standard deviation factors such as μmax 20 ram rb and rns have lower standard deviation values which signifies that they have a linear and additive effect on the other input parameters factors other than these have low mean and low standard deviation values which suggests that their effects on the input factors are negligible similarly fig 4b suggest that μ n has the highest impact for ammonia nitrogen in water accounting for the maximum variability with respect to other parameters while ram rb have a considerably high standard deviation as compared to the absolute mean which indicates non linear behaviour involving interactions with other input parameters similar trends is represented for nitrate nitrogen fig 4c where μ n plays a significant role in the variability of the input parameters as compared to other input factors while other factors have a negligible effect on the variability however for plant nitrogen there exist two factors μmpu1 and μmpu2 which show significant influence as compared to other parameters fig 4d this shows that the maximum uptake by plants for both ammonia and nitrate respectively play significant role in variability of the input parameters while other factors have negligible influence fig 4e represents the effects of sediment nitrogen in relation to other parameters μ n is the only parameter which shows a non linear effect on the variability of the parameter rns and rnrs show higher mean values with small standard deviation range which indicates a linear and additive effect on the variability total phosphorus in water and sediment phosphorus fig 4f g show similar behaviours for all the corresponding parameters where rprs has a significant influence on the variability on the other hand the elementary effects on plant phosphorus indicate that rpdc and μmppu show a linear influence while rprs shows a non linear influence with other input parameters 3 3 calibration and validation of the model based on the sensitivity analysis model calibration of different parameters were carried out using first twelve months of sampling data the calibrated model was then validated with the remaining five months of sampling data the initial values of the state variables that were used in the model during calibration are given in table 1 the values of the state variables are expressed in g m2 day the calibrated value of the parameters are shown in table 2 along with the literature range obtained from different sources figs 5 and 6 represent the plots between simulated versus observed parameters of the model for calibration and validation respectively excellent agreements between the modelled output and the actual observations indicated the effectiveness of the model in predicting the actual behaviours of the model parameters with respect to the actual natural conditions some of the important observations made are described below organic nitrogen in water column observed average organic nitrogen in the water column decreases in the winter season and rises as the monsoon approaches and peaks in the month of august 2018 304th day the simulated average organic nitrogen in the water column has been able to mimic such a trend fig 5a this is mainly attributed to the fact that the discharge from the basistha river is maximum during this period thus influencing heavy discharge of nutrients into the wetland the reaction rates involved in the sub model also behave in a similar manner as the simulated average organic nitrogen trend however the decay rate of plant nitrogen is observed to have the least effect on the organic nitrogen sub model ammonia nitrogen in water column the average ammonia nitrogen in the water column reduces to the minimum in the month of may 2018 212th day beyond which it rises again fig 5b inflowing and outflowing ammonia nitrogen concentration has little role to play in the variation of the simulated data which is largely affected by ammonification and microbial uptake nitrification and resuspension of sediment nitrogen also plays a decent role in such variations the rate of ammonia utilization by plants for growth had the minimum impact on the state variable nitrate nitrogen in water column nitrate nitrogen in the water column remains considerably low till june 2018 243rd day beyond which it quickly spikes to high values in the months of july and august 2018 fig 5c this is mainly because nitrification and inflowing nitrate nitrogen had significant contributions to the simulated data variation whereas plant uptake played a minimal role plant nitrogen the simulated average plant nitrogen in deepor beel showed high correlation with the observed average plant nitrogen fig 5d the reaction rates involved in the sub model are relatively very low compared to the reaction rates in other sub models the decay rate of plant nitrogen appears to be constant in comparison to ammonia and nitrate uptake rates which dominates the slight variations observed in the simulated data sediment nitrogen simulated average sediment nitrogen in deepor beel is assumed to be regulated by two reaction rates settling rate of organic nitrogen and ammonia regeneration rate the one dimensional ecological model has been mostly successful is predicting the variation of observed average sediment nitrogen using this simple assumption fig 5e total phosphorus in water column the average total phosphorus in water column remained low in the initial simulation period until may 2018 212rd day beyond which it spiked rapidly to reach the highest observed average total phosphorus concentration in the month of july 2018 273rd day fig 5f this sub model appears to be largely affected by the inflowing and outflowing concentrations of total phosphorus while other reaction rates seem to have negligible influence plant phosphorus the simulated average plant phosphorus appears to be fairly correlated to the observed average plant phosphorus fig 5g the reaction rates involved in the sub model have very low values due to which they failed to have any significant impact on other sub models but the in this sub model both the reactions had equal dominance sediment phosphorus the observed average sediment phosphorus appears to rise rapidly post june 2018 243rd day which has been successfully simulated by the model fig 5h in this state variable the rate of settling of phosphorus plays a significant role in regulating the variation of the simulated data but the delayed peak in the simulated reflects the considerable effect of sediment phosphorus resuspension rate the output of the model during validation was subjected to regression analysis to obtain the rmse and coefficient of determination r2 values for each state variable table 3 good agreement was observed between the simulated data and observed data for all the state variables organic nitrogen ammonia nitrogen and total phosphorus in water showed very high correlation r2 0 95 while nitrate nitrogen sediment nitrogen and plant nitrogen showed slightly lower correlation r2 0 8 0 9 sediment phosphorus and plant nitrogen showed least correlation among all the state variables r2 0 7705 and 0 6260 respectively but considering the natural system such low values of correlation of determination are considered acceptable arhonditsis and brett 2005 the outcomes of the model during validation are present in fig 6a h 3 4 plausible role of harvesting of plants in deepor beel the effects of harvesting of water hyacinths in deepor beel on different types of nutrients is shown in fig 7 a h the model was designed to check the behaviour of all the state variables when the plants in the lake were subjected to no harvesting as well as to three hypothetical harvesting rates 80 90 and 100 as evident from the graphs harvesting of plants had little effect on the nutrients in different levels except for plant nitrogen and plant phosphorus which is obvious as the removal of plants from the ecosystem will also remove the nitrogen and phosphorus compounds attached to it the other state variables however remain unaffected from harvesting as the rates of ammonia nitrogen and phosphorus utilization by the plants for growth as well as rates of plant nitrogen and phosphorus decay are significantly low in comparison to other reaction rates involved in the respective sub models this also explains the temporary nature of the harvesting in weed control of water hyacinth as the nutrients in the lake remain intact even after harvesting barely removing the plants from the lake could not prevent the plants from resurfacing in the future therefore harvesting of plants in deepor beel will not be an effective measure in controlling the eutrophication in the lake 3 5 plausible role of a treatment unit in deepor beel the treatment of inflowing water to deepor beel is found to have a significant impact on the state variables of the model fig 8 a h organic nitrogen in the lake rapidly decreases on introducing a treatment unit in the lake and reduction further intensifies with higher treatment efficiencies fig 8a ammonia nitrogen in the lake also decreases but such decreases are not as drastic as decreases in organic nitrogen fig 8b however similar to the organic nitrogen ammonia nitrogen decreases more with increase in treatment efficiency nitrate nitrogen in deepor beel also decreases rapidly and increasing the treatment efficiencies leads to smoothening of the temporal variation of average nitrate nitrogen in deepor beel fig 8c the treatment unit does not have any significant effect on plant nitrogen initially but in the later part of the simulation plant nitrogen shows considerable incremental decrease with incremental increase in treatment efficiency fig 8d the widening gap between the trends of plant nitrogen without treatment and with treatment in the later stages of simulation indicates a possibility of permanent decrease in plant nitrogen in the future the sediment nitrogen in deepor beel also decreases when a treatment unit is introduced in the lake and further smoothens out when the treatment efficiency is increased fig 8e the phosphorus components also behave similar to the nitrogen counterparts when a treatment unit is introduced in deepor beel 4 conclusion the present study was conducted to develop a one dimensional ecological model for deepor beel in order to understand the fate of nutrients and thereby develop a better understanding of the eutrophication process in the wetland the major outcomes of this study are listed as follows the one dimensional ecological model developed in this study has been successful in predicting the distribution of nutrients in different state variables identified in deepor beel the rmse and r2 values of all the state variables lied in the range 0 0001265 2 0220 and 0 6260 0 9979 respectively during model validation and thereby substantiating the successful behaviour of the model the calibrated model provided interesting insights to the behaviour of the state variables it has eloquently highlighted the fact that rates of nutrient uptake by plants are considerably low to have any effect on the behaviour of the state variables other than those related to plants the model has also explained the lesser dependence of ammonia nitrogen state variable on the inflowing and outflowing ammonia nitrogen for variation it has also revealed the dominant role of rate of nitrification as well as inflowing and outflowing concentration of different nutrients on different state variables the application of the model to study the effects of harvesting the plants from deepor beel at different harvesting rates has successfully corroborated the fact that harvesting of plants is merely a temporary solution to the eutrophication problem as the nutrients in the water column remain nearly intact during harvesting simulation the nutrient uptake rates as well as decay rates of plants are considerably low to have any pronounced effect on other state variables even when the complete harvesting simulation of the plants was carried out finally the model predicted that introduction of a treatment unit to deepor beel such that the water entering the lake is partially treated before entry can be very effective in eutrophication abatement in the lake the nutrient concentration significantly decreased in the water column during simulation and growth of plants also decreased the diverging trends of plant nitrogen without harvesting and with harvesting indicated a possible decrease in the plant population if the treatment unit is operational for a long period declaration of competing interest none appendix a supplementary data supplementary material related to this article can be found in the online version at doi https doi

24937,population effects of stressors such as toxic chemicals or increased temperatures affecting the energy budgets of organisms are mediated by predation pressure and food availability however these two population contexts have mostly been considered separately moreover because the sensitivity of the different pathways of energy to stress may differ it is difficult to predict combined stressor effects we used an agent based model of fathead minnows pimephales promelas to infer the population level impacts of a hypothetical sublethal stressor that affects an individual s metabolism growth reproduction maintenance or assimilation in systems in which population size is controlled by different combinations of food availability and predation we found that population level effects are rarely directly proportional to individual level effects and were greater when the stressor impacted assimilation and populations were predation controlled our results suggest that individual level measurements alone are insufficient for inferring population level impacts of stressors and that accurate inference hinges on insight into how populations are regulated we suggest incorporating individual level data into mechanistic models that take into account both the energy budgets of individuals and the population level context keywords population level effects of stressors individual based model dynamic energy budget theory population regulating factors context dependent stressor effects ecological risk assessment 1 introduction the effects of human activities on natural systems which are likely to increase in the future tilman et al 2017 include eutrophication predator decimation climate change habitat loss invasive species and use of toxic chemicals all of which affect biodiversity productivity and or ecosystem stability hautier et al 2015 fahrig 2003 mack and d antonio 1998 relyea 2005 these stresses on ecological systems can result in species population declines and even extinctions vitousek et al 1997 seifert et al 2015 detecting stressor impacts at the population level is consequently very important but challenging due to the natural variability of populations and the large spatiotemporal scales that are needed to detect changes in population dynamics forbes et al 2016 therefore stressor impacts are frequently measured at the individual and sub individual levels köhler and triebskorn 2013 however methods are needed to extrapolate from effects on individuals to impacts on populations because population level impacts are not necessarily proportional to individual level responses gergs et al 2013 galic et al 2017 schmolke et al 2017 scaling from individual to population level impacts is challenging because a stressor can impact the survival growth and or reproduction of an individual as well as how individuals interact with each other and their environment population dynamics emerge from these individual level interactions often nonlinearly as a result of positive or negative feedbacks nisbet et al 1997 closed populations are regulated through reproduction and death both of which depend on the balance between bottom up forces e g food availability and top down forces e g predation hunter and price 1992 therefore the population level impact of a stressor emerges from the degree to which that stressor impacts individual traits and how the population is regulated in the absence of stress for example it has been demonstrated that population level effects of stressors can depend on resource density martin et al 2014 moe et al 2002 predation relyea 2004 coors and de meester 2008 and constraints that are inherent to study designs forbes et al 2001 thus there is a pressing need for studies that systematically assess the stress responses of populations under top down versus bottom up control in this study we used an individual based model ibm to explore individual and population level impacts of hypothetical stressors in a wide range of top down and bottom up controlled populations an ibm approach allows impacts at the population level to be predicted from observations at the individual level stillman et al 2014 our ibm used dynamic energy budget deb theory kooijman 2010 to describe stressor impacts on individual energy intake and allocation álvarez et al 2006 jager 2015 this combined approach allowed us to study the impacts of stressors across levels of biological organization and gain insight into the conditions under which populations are likely to be impacted by stressors that affect different individual level responses a deb ibm approach has been used to model population dynamics of many species beaudouin et al 2012 martin et al 2013 galic et al 2017 thomas and bacher 2018 including fishes beaudouin et al 2015 david et al 2019 accolla et al 2019 we simulated multiple populations of fathead minnow pimephales promelas that are controlled by varying degrees of food availability and or predation pressure the fathead minnows is a temperate freshwater fish that is widespread in north america and common in laboratory guideline 2001 and field kidd et al 2007 studies of chemical stressors this omnivorous fish is widely consumed by predators and can have a substantial influence on community characteristics for example by reducing invertebrate populations thereby creating conditions that favor high phytoplankton biomass low water transparency and reduced submerged aquatic vegetation herwig and zimmer 2007 fathead minnows are an important component of the great lakes ecosystem and recent studies have demonstrated that exposure to contaminants of emerging concern cecs which are ubiquitous throughout this ecosystem elliott et al 2017 2018 impact fathead minnow metabolism development and fecundity baldwin et al 2016 thomas et al 2017 cipoletti et al 2019 our work explores whether there are general patterns of population level effects for different population types predator food controlled stressor modes of action on individual energetics and stressor intensities 2 methods we developed an ibm following martin et al 2012 in which the energetics of individuals are described with deb theory kooijman 2010 the code is developed in java using the simaqualife framework dumoulin 2007 the code is available in si 2 the model describes the population dynamics of the fathead minnow in different river systems and simulates exposure to stressors with different individual level modes of action fig 1 the supplemental materials si 2 contain a full description of the deb ibm model following the odd protocol overview design concepts details for describing individual and agent based models grimm et al 2006 2010 as well as further details on model development and parameterization 2 1 purpose the purpose of the model is to predict the population level effects of exposure to stressors in different ecosystem contexts we defined the individual level response to stressors with four types of physiological modes of action pmoas álvarez et al 2006 jager 2015 an increase in cost of growth an increase in cost of reproduction an increase in maintenance costs and a decrease in assimilation rate effects of stressors on parameters are detailed in supplemental materials si 2 part 2 12 we also simulated systems under bottom up versus top down control to evaluate how the external drivers of population dynamics influence population level responses to stressors fig 2 in total we modeled 225 systems in which population size was determined by varying degrees of both food availability and predation pressure over these 225 systems we selected 109 that were ecologically realistic based on literature data we compared the outputs of the population model with published ecological observations fish density spawning interval number of reproduction events number of eggs per clutch more detail can be found in the supplementary information si 2 section 3 2 2 2 basic principles the model is based on deb theory for describing the energetics of individuals the deb model describes how individuals feed allocate energy for growth and reproduction and die of aging and or starvation the degree of food limitation in our model depends on both fish density and the logistic growth parameter for food we introduced predation as a third external source of mortality because deb theory only represents mortality due to aging and starvation at each time step if a randomly selected number continuous uniform distribution u 0 1 is less than the stage specific probability of dying from predation then the organism dies see si 2 part 2 7 1 in this study we considered a stage specific density independent predation mortality rate and an indirect competition for food from which emerged density dependence the source of density dependence in population regulation can come from both predation and competition while competition is always density dependent predation is not hixon et al 2002 to observe density dependent prey mortality the predator must have a regulating total response combination of numerical response functional response and other responses to changes in prey abundance hixon et al 2002 murdoch and oaten 1975 sinclair and pech 1996 in experimental tests that were designed to test for predation or competition as the source of density dependence competition was more often density dependent than predation hixon and jones 2005 moreover the fish literature contains examples of both density dependent anderson 2001 steele and forrester 2002 and density independent predation hixon and carr 1997 steele and forrester 2002 2 3 entities state variables and scales there are two types of entities in the model individual fish and spatial unit we used the scaled version of the deb model with metabolic acceleration to represent the energy budget of individuals individuals are characterized by six state variables namely structure l in cm scaled reserve u e d cm2 scaled maturity u h d cm2 scaled reproduction u r d cm2 damage inducing compounds q expressed as aging acceleration and damage h expressed as hazard rate all the equations and parameters of the deb model are available in the supplemental material si 2 sections 2 and 3 for more details and an introduction to deb theory see nisbet et al 2000 van der meer 2006 sousa et al 2010 jusup et al 2016 we introduced a normally distributed scatter multiplier μ 1 and σ 0 05 to account for inter individual variability in six of the standard deb parameters half saturation coefficient energy investment ratio the scaled maturity thresholds for hatching birth metamorphosis and puberty see si 2 part 2 4 9 the model has one spatial unit representing a 10 ha zone of a river this zone is characterized by three quantitative state variables the prey density x j cm 2 temperature t in c and surface area in m2 prey density changes once during each daily time step according to a logistic growth equation and fish consumption the logistic growth function has two parameters daily intrinsic growth rate a e in d 1 and the carrying capacity k e in j m 2 temperature is the same in the entire zone range from 0 9 to 24 4 c during the year and changes daily according to online temperature data that were recorded in 2015 in kawishiwi river mn https waterdata usgs gov nwis this river is located at the northern frontier of the great lakes basin and has a temperature profile that is characteristic of this zone all the parameters and equations of the ibm are available in supplemental materials si 2 sections 2 and 3 2 4 simulations we ran five 20 year simulations for each of the 109 system types that we modeled one that did not involve a stressor and four in which a stressor impacted a specific pmoa growth reproduction maintenance or assimilation at one of four levels of severity 6 25 12 5 25 or 50 we replicated each combination of system stressor and severity 20 times see si 2 part 7 1 for justification on number of replicates all simulations began with a 4 year phase in period that involved introducing new individuals during each reproductive season if a simulation involved a stressor we initiated a 5 year exposure at the start of year 15 2 5 observations and analysis we collected observations on fish in the size range from 1 5 to 9 8 cm density eggs per female the fulton condition index for adults ratio of weight to cubic length total biomass for fish in the targeted size range the number of deaths by predation starvation or aging and population size distribution psd ratio of the number of individuals bigger than 4 5 cm over the number of individuals bigger than 1 5 cm i e the ratio of adults in the population we calculated a starvation index si as the proportion of dead individuals that died from starvation over the last 5 years of a simulation without stressor the si reflected the extent to which the population was top down or bottom up controlled fig 2 for example a low si means that relatively few individuals are dying of starvation which is typical during top down i e predator control we calculated changes in population size abundance of fish in the targeted size range total biomass and eggs per year by comparing average values over the last 5 years of stressed and unstressed simulations of the same system and using the same initial conditions and stochasticity i e the same seed if a stressor affects individuals we expect to see some effects on the population growth rate we calculated the daily per capita growth rate pcgr as the daily change in total biomass of individuals between 1 5 and 9 8 cm divided by the number of individuals in this size range this standard measure allowed us to compare population growth rate across different combinations of predation and food control i e different population sizes we linked the pcgr to different intervals of population density 20 intervals population density ranging from 0 to 10 000 according to the population density on the day of the computation because the relationship was convex see si 2 part 7 4 we fitted the following logarithmic function with a linear regression using the r function lm with default arguments 1 log pcgr a dd s log fd where fd is fish population density a was estimated for every system but was held constant when comparing stressed and unstressed systems dds which represents the strength of the density dependence was estimated for every system and stress condition the underlying idea was that stress would change the strength of the density dependence only we only included populations in which the average abundance was 4000 individuals to avoid low goodness of fit because small sized populations did not have enough data points 3 results our results show that the effects of stressors on populations are rarely proportional to the intensity level of stressors on individuals the magnitude of the impact on a population depends on the strength of the stressor the pmoa on which the stressor is acting and the degree to which a population is predator controlled as measured by the starvation index si populations in which individuals experienced a 25 increase in the cost of reproduction exhibited a 5 reduction in population size for most values of the starvation index reductions 5 were only observed if the population was mostly predator controlled si values close to 0 fig 3 a variability in the magnitude of the response was also highest when si was low we observed a similar population level response for a 25 increase in maintenance costs fig 3b conversely population size was uniformly variable and decreased almost linearly with si for a 25 reduction in feeding rate fig 3c beginning from a net increase in population size for si values larger than 0 11 i e in food limited populations finally the population level response to a 25 increase in the cost of growth fig 3d was intermediate to these extremes the shape of the loess regression lines between population size change and the starvation index indicates the proportion of populations that are at risk most of the populations that were impacted through reproduction fig 3a or maintenance fig 3b showed a 5 decline in population size the number of populations that showed a 5 decline in population size was much larger when exposed to a stressor that impacted feeding rate fig 3c or cost of growth fig 3d the proportion of populations at risk also changed with the intensity of the stressor effect fig 4 and included a threshold stressor intensity above which there was a sharp increase in the impact on population size and the number of populations at risk increasing the intensity of a stressor affecting reproduction fig 4a or maintenance fig 4b tended to increase the negative impact on predation controlled populations other populations in these pmoa scenarios did not show large impacts until the stressor intensity increased from 25 to 50 stressor effects extended beyond predator controlled populations at lower intensities when affecting feeding rate fig 4c and cost of growth fig 4d we identified demographic traits that were correlated with the population declines observed in figs 3 and 4 the population size distribution fig 5 is the ratio between adults individuals 4 5 cm and all individuals size larger than 1 5 cm consequently a larger value means that the proportion of adults is higher the fulton index or k index fig 6 is the ratio between individual weight and its cubic length higher k values indicate that individuals are in better condition regardless of pmoa the most vulnerable populations i e predation controlled populations tended to contain lower proportions of adults fig 5 that were relatively heavy for a given length fig 6 prior to the introduction of the stressor a stressor induced change in dd s is a proportional measure of the extent to which a population response includes variation in the strength of density dependence fig 7 large population changes tended to be associated with increases in the strength of density dependence for all pmoas except for reproduction fig 7a the predation controlled populations in red showed the largest increases whereas the food controlled populations in blue showed the smallest increases the range of stressor induced decline in population size is dependent on the pmoa nevertheless the intensity of the change in dd s results in a similar population size change for the different pmoas except for cost of reproduction for instance a 4 increase in dds is associated with about a 30 decrease in population size when a stressor impacts maintenance costs fig 7b feeding rate fig 7c or cost of growth fig 7d 4 discussion in this study we investigated how stressors acting on different modes of action at the individual level resulted in population level effects in systems that varied in the relative importance of predation and food as controlling factors our results confirm that population level responses are rarely proportional to individual level responses and depend on whether the population is controlled by predation or food availability the latter was largely due to the inability of predation controlled populations to exhibit compensatory density dependent responses we also found that stressor pmoa and intensity influence the extent to which the systems are impacted and the proportion of systems that are at risk of significant population decrease the effects of stressors are frequently measured at the individual and sub individual levels köhler and triebskorn 2013 even though conservation goals are expressed at higher levels of biological organization e g population community regardless of pmoa individual level impacts for example on growth and or egg production are not proportional to the percent change in energy assimilation or metabolic costs martin et al 2013 2014 consequently our results figs 3 and 4 are consistent with previous studies gergs et al 2013 galic et al 2017 schmolke et al 2017 that show that population level effects are not proportional to individual level responses the tendency of the moderately to strongly food limited populations to increase in size figs 3 and 4 in response to a stressor is a good illustration of this non proportionality this hydra effect sensu abrams 2009 results from compensatory mechanisms the strength of which depends on the considered system different systems have different population dynamics emerging from interactions among individuals and with their environment and thus exhibit different demographic traits our deb ibm approach allowed us to relate different demographic traits to population decline regardless of pmoa we saw that impacts were smallest in populations that had a low k index prior to stress fig 6 in other words individuals in these systems did not grow and reproduce optimally because resource density had a strong control over population size consequently any stress induced decrease in food competition will have a positive impact on population size for instance fish produce fewer eggs and therefore fewer new individuals when the stressor increases the cost of reproduction the subsequent decline in food competition meant that individuals grew faster reached a larger size and produced more eggs less impacted populations are also those with the higher psd fig 5 meaning that they had proportionally more adults adults buffered populations from the individual level impact of a stressor because they are able to convert the additional energy that resulted from a reduction in competition for food into eggs see supplemental material si 1 part 2 alternatively there was little compensation when populations were controlled by predation pressure both juveniles and adults in these systems were less abundant as a result of predation moreover they were already reproducing and growing optimally i e close to their biological maximum before the stressor was applied our results show that the range of variation of population level impacts changes when considering different pmoas figs 3 and 4 for instance pmoas that cause a delay in maturation increased cost of growth increased costs of maintenance decreased feeding rate had greater population level impacts because early life stages are more susceptible to predation the strength of the reduction in competition for food also differs because different pmoas impact individuals differently which will induce different consequences on population dynamics at the individual level pmoas have an effect on somatic and or reproductive pathways martin et al 2013 2014 which will alter growth and or reproductive outputs for example in deb theory when the cost of reproduction is impacted growth is not affected the production of eggs is reduced due to a loss of efficiency in converting the energy buffer for reproduction into eggs but the amount of energy allocated to growth is not altered because assimilation depends on the length of the organism the integrated amount of ingested food over the whole life span of an organism will remain the same on the contrary when growth or maintenance costs increase both individual growth and reproduction are impacted and the integrated amount of ingested food over the whole life span of an organism will be reduced when feeding rate decreases growth and reproduction are both affected but in this case the organism takes up less energy instead of spending more here again the integrated amount of ingested food over the whole life span of an organism will be reduced these different individual level impacts have different consequences at the population level when the cost of reproduction is affected only the number of produced eggs is impacted as they are costlier to produce in this case there will be fewer individuals in the system due to lower recruitment resulting in an overall population decline increasing maintenance costs causes slower organism growth and maturation consequently individuals stay longer in early developmental stages which are more vulnerable to predation this is also the case when the cost of growth increases because smaller individuals get less food and thus have less energy available for maturation meanwhile as smaller organisms take up less energy there is more food in the system and thus more organisms can survive resource competition when feeding rate is affected less food is consumed and stays in the system nevertheless even if the strength of competition for food is reduced the remaining food is not accessible by organisms so it has no benefit and compensation does not occur our results highlight the importance of determining the pmoa of a stressor at the individual level because population level responses for different pmoas can differ markedly in fact the proportion of populations at risk as well as the intensity of the population level impact are highly dependent on the pmoa of the stressor at the individual level see differences between panels in figs 3 and 4 for instance we observed that a stressor impacting the feeding rate of individuals would systematically result in a stronger decrease in population size for every stressor level compared to any other pmoa fig 4 moreover the proportion of potentially highly impacted populations is also higher when considering this pmoa martin et al 2014 noted that measuring individual level outputs such as growth rate or egg production was not sufficient to determine the pmoa of a stressor because a similar decrease in one of these individual level outputs could be caused by different pmoas our results support the added value of assessing other physiological processes such as respiration to understand which pmoa is affected at the individual level our results also indicate the importance of considering both food availability and predation pressure when natural resource managers assess the potential impact of a stressor because they both contribute to density dependent mechanisms that can impact population growth rate population growth rate provides a more relevant measure of ecological impact of stressors than individual level measurements because it integrates potentially complex interactions occurring at lower levels of biological organization forbes and calow 1999 our results show that exposure to stressors systematically changes the strength of density dependence and that the intensity of the change is directly related to population size change fig 7 an identical stress level for different pmoas results in different population changes depending on how a population is regulated fig 3 but a similar change in the intensity of the pcgr density dependence appears to produce similar population declines for different pmoas fig 7 a stressor impact on reproduction cost resulted in a decrease in the intensity of density dependence because it is the pmoa that has the strongest population level compensatory mechanism for the other pmoas stressed populations always showed an increase in the strength of density dependence other studies have focused on population level effects in different system contexts in accordance with our results a study that considered the effects of food density moe et al 2002 found that blowfly populations at high densities and therefore lower food availability showed a positive effect when exposed to cadmium our results are also similar to an empirical study showing strong ecological compensation in response to toxic chemicals at low food levels but an increase in extinction probability in unlimited food conditions barata et al 2002 other experimental studies gui and grant 2008 beketov and liess 2005 show similar results but some experiments showed that food limitation can exacerbate toxicant effects linke gamenick et al 1999 pieters et al 2005 for instance martin et al 2014 found that low productivity environments had lower capacity to buffer stress in daphnia magna whereas experiments by relyea and mills 2001 relyea 2004 showed that predator induced stress increased the susceptibility of tadpoles to chemical stress experiments by coors and de meester 2008 found that predation stress acted antagonistically with chemical stress in daphnia magna these inconsistencies in the relationship between density dependence and responses to stressors may at least in part be due to the constraints of different study designs forbes et al 2001 and further work is needed to determine the conditions under which density dependence exacerbates or ameliorates the responses of populations to stress despite the importance of understanding the influence of natural drivers such as predation and competition on the responses of populations to toxic chemicals field studies are rare and results variable for example johnson and chen 2017 compared historic fisheries data with predicted estrogen exposure and concluded that estrogen contained in wastewater did not lead to a catastrophic decline in four species of cyprinid fish in one of very few controlled field experiments of its kind kidd et al 2007 observed a collapse of a fathead minnow population in a lake after long term exposure to high concentrations of estrogen although this experiment was performed with estrogen concentrations an order of magnitude higher than those generally found in rivers downstream of treated sewage discharges matthiessen et al 2018 it is interesting that the population collapse was not observed for three other fish species kidd et al 2014 there is growing recognition that wildlife populations are exposed to complex mixtures of chemicals the impacts of which are unclear for example recent studies in the great lakes basin have detected the presence of large numbers of agricultural and urban cecs in tributaries elliott et al 2018 cipoletti et al 2019 and some of these contaminants have been found to have effects on individual fish in laboratory experiments baldwin et al 2016 thomas et al 2017 cipoletti et al 2019 thomas et al 2017 documented the biological effects of cecs on resident and caged fish across 27 field sites in six great lakes tributaries and highlighted that biological responses were different between these two groups they argued that caged fish were in a better nutritional status before the exposure which could have contributed to their different response our results show that population characteristics e g population structure fig 5 as well as individual characteristics e g adult condition index fig 6 vary depending on how the population is regulated and we were able to relate these characteristics to population level impacts it is important to note that a population is defined as being predation or food controlled based on the balance of these two factors not on the presence or even degree of predation or food limitation a population that is in a high predator or high food environment can either be top down or bottom up controlled we show in the supplemental material si 2 part 7 3 that parameters defining food density and predation pressure are not correlated with the starvation index our work used deb theory which is a standardized generic model that describes the metabolism of all species kooijman 2010 using this methodology to describe the growth and reproduction of individual fish in the ibm is relevant because these processes are not directly dependent on food availability in deb theory consequently how individuals grow reproduce and survive in different systems are emergent properties of the model and not based on a priori hypotheses although our work relied on deb theory which provides a common model structure that applies to all species extrapolating from the physiological processes that are captured in deb to individual level properties and population level consequences is species dependent species vary widely in their sensitivity to stressors at the individual level baas and kooijman 2015 and differences in ecology between species can impact population level effects of stressors recent findings highlighted that even closely related species that have similar individual level stressor responses for a given pmoa can exhibit large differences in population level effects in terms of both population size and biomass accolla et al 2019 future work should evaluate the generality of our results with respect to other species we also encourage research to evaluate the population level impacts of a stressor for various food web scenarios e g strong versus weak interspecific competition ideally when predators competitors and prey are also vulnerable to the stressor we recognize that stressors do not always occur in isolation but can combine to produce complex population level effects galic et al 2017 2018 we also encourage the setup of laboratory experiments for example one could conduct lab or mesocosm experiments in which food availability and predation are strictly controlled the population sizes of these different populations would need to be independent of the strength of the controlling factors and the treatment would involve the introduction of a standardized stressor once population dynamics are stabilized our results may be impacted by how we represented predation in the model we chose to represent predation mortality as stage specific and density independent because it is the simplest hypothesis and therefore we could better understand the behavior of this first version of the model compensation would also have been observed if we had considered a density dependent mortality due to predation as shown by another study involving a fish ibm which included density dependent mortality rate mintram et al 2018 furthermore there is no guarantee to the intuitive idea that the observed difference between predation and food controlled systems when exposed to a stressor is due to the fact that predation is density independent in the model first density dependence of predation can occur for multiple reasons because predation is a complex phenomenon that involves many biological and ecological processes when a stressor is introduced it may or may not act on one or several of these processes moreover even if no change due to a stressor on density dependent predation induced mortality was considered predation controlled systems may remain more sensitive the reason is that predation controlled systems do not necessarily have the strongest predation mortality rates see si 2 part 7 3 what defines how a system is controlled is the balance between predation pressure and food availability and what defines how a system will be impacted is how this balance will be impacted consequently we encourage more detailed studies on this subject in summary our study uses an ibm to infer population level responses to stressors in different population types from individual level effects other published studies report diverse population level effects of predation pressure and food density when considering the effect of a stressor martin et al 2014 moe et al 2002 relyea 2004 coors and de meester 2008 our study contributes to this literature by considering both factors simultaneously and by varying both the strength of the stressor and the pmoa our results suggest that top down controlled populations are more vulnerable than bottom up controlled populations and that stressors that reduce feeding rate impact a larger proportion of populations and in a stronger way than any other pmoas this finding is consistent with growing evidence that it is difficult to infer population level effects from individual level effects without an estimate of the relative importance of bottom up and top down controls on population size our study offers a theoretical approach that isolates the interplay of stressor effects with interacting factors predation and competition for food that regulate population size highlighting how mechanisms of compensation can differ in different systems consequently our results showing that population level responses depend on how populations are regulated are potentially generalizable to other species and stressors our model focuses on a single species and stressor in the absence of complex food web dynamics as an important first step in providing initial insight and generating testable hypotheses our model and models like it are valuable tools for exploring interactions between stressors and other factors that control populations over relevant spatial and temporal scales while reducing animal testing and the ethical concerns involved therein these models are versatile in that they can handle any shape of dose response relationship including those that are non monotonic in addition to estimating the population level impact of an effect they can also be used to back calculate effect levels i e thresholds at the individual level that would result in unacceptable population level impacts declaration of interests none

24937,population effects of stressors such as toxic chemicals or increased temperatures affecting the energy budgets of organisms are mediated by predation pressure and food availability however these two population contexts have mostly been considered separately moreover because the sensitivity of the different pathways of energy to stress may differ it is difficult to predict combined stressor effects we used an agent based model of fathead minnows pimephales promelas to infer the population level impacts of a hypothetical sublethal stressor that affects an individual s metabolism growth reproduction maintenance or assimilation in systems in which population size is controlled by different combinations of food availability and predation we found that population level effects are rarely directly proportional to individual level effects and were greater when the stressor impacted assimilation and populations were predation controlled our results suggest that individual level measurements alone are insufficient for inferring population level impacts of stressors and that accurate inference hinges on insight into how populations are regulated we suggest incorporating individual level data into mechanistic models that take into account both the energy budgets of individuals and the population level context keywords population level effects of stressors individual based model dynamic energy budget theory population regulating factors context dependent stressor effects ecological risk assessment 1 introduction the effects of human activities on natural systems which are likely to increase in the future tilman et al 2017 include eutrophication predator decimation climate change habitat loss invasive species and use of toxic chemicals all of which affect biodiversity productivity and or ecosystem stability hautier et al 2015 fahrig 2003 mack and d antonio 1998 relyea 2005 these stresses on ecological systems can result in species population declines and even extinctions vitousek et al 1997 seifert et al 2015 detecting stressor impacts at the population level is consequently very important but challenging due to the natural variability of populations and the large spatiotemporal scales that are needed to detect changes in population dynamics forbes et al 2016 therefore stressor impacts are frequently measured at the individual and sub individual levels köhler and triebskorn 2013 however methods are needed to extrapolate from effects on individuals to impacts on populations because population level impacts are not necessarily proportional to individual level responses gergs et al 2013 galic et al 2017 schmolke et al 2017 scaling from individual to population level impacts is challenging because a stressor can impact the survival growth and or reproduction of an individual as well as how individuals interact with each other and their environment population dynamics emerge from these individual level interactions often nonlinearly as a result of positive or negative feedbacks nisbet et al 1997 closed populations are regulated through reproduction and death both of which depend on the balance between bottom up forces e g food availability and top down forces e g predation hunter and price 1992 therefore the population level impact of a stressor emerges from the degree to which that stressor impacts individual traits and how the population is regulated in the absence of stress for example it has been demonstrated that population level effects of stressors can depend on resource density martin et al 2014 moe et al 2002 predation relyea 2004 coors and de meester 2008 and constraints that are inherent to study designs forbes et al 2001 thus there is a pressing need for studies that systematically assess the stress responses of populations under top down versus bottom up control in this study we used an individual based model ibm to explore individual and population level impacts of hypothetical stressors in a wide range of top down and bottom up controlled populations an ibm approach allows impacts at the population level to be predicted from observations at the individual level stillman et al 2014 our ibm used dynamic energy budget deb theory kooijman 2010 to describe stressor impacts on individual energy intake and allocation álvarez et al 2006 jager 2015 this combined approach allowed us to study the impacts of stressors across levels of biological organization and gain insight into the conditions under which populations are likely to be impacted by stressors that affect different individual level responses a deb ibm approach has been used to model population dynamics of many species beaudouin et al 2012 martin et al 2013 galic et al 2017 thomas and bacher 2018 including fishes beaudouin et al 2015 david et al 2019 accolla et al 2019 we simulated multiple populations of fathead minnow pimephales promelas that are controlled by varying degrees of food availability and or predation pressure the fathead minnows is a temperate freshwater fish that is widespread in north america and common in laboratory guideline 2001 and field kidd et al 2007 studies of chemical stressors this omnivorous fish is widely consumed by predators and can have a substantial influence on community characteristics for example by reducing invertebrate populations thereby creating conditions that favor high phytoplankton biomass low water transparency and reduced submerged aquatic vegetation herwig and zimmer 2007 fathead minnows are an important component of the great lakes ecosystem and recent studies have demonstrated that exposure to contaminants of emerging concern cecs which are ubiquitous throughout this ecosystem elliott et al 2017 2018 impact fathead minnow metabolism development and fecundity baldwin et al 2016 thomas et al 2017 cipoletti et al 2019 our work explores whether there are general patterns of population level effects for different population types predator food controlled stressor modes of action on individual energetics and stressor intensities 2 methods we developed an ibm following martin et al 2012 in which the energetics of individuals are described with deb theory kooijman 2010 the code is developed in java using the simaqualife framework dumoulin 2007 the code is available in si 2 the model describes the population dynamics of the fathead minnow in different river systems and simulates exposure to stressors with different individual level modes of action fig 1 the supplemental materials si 2 contain a full description of the deb ibm model following the odd protocol overview design concepts details for describing individual and agent based models grimm et al 2006 2010 as well as further details on model development and parameterization 2 1 purpose the purpose of the model is to predict the population level effects of exposure to stressors in different ecosystem contexts we defined the individual level response to stressors with four types of physiological modes of action pmoas álvarez et al 2006 jager 2015 an increase in cost of growth an increase in cost of reproduction an increase in maintenance costs and a decrease in assimilation rate effects of stressors on parameters are detailed in supplemental materials si 2 part 2 12 we also simulated systems under bottom up versus top down control to evaluate how the external drivers of population dynamics influence population level responses to stressors fig 2 in total we modeled 225 systems in which population size was determined by varying degrees of both food availability and predation pressure over these 225 systems we selected 109 that were ecologically realistic based on literature data we compared the outputs of the population model with published ecological observations fish density spawning interval number of reproduction events number of eggs per clutch more detail can be found in the supplementary information si 2 section 3 2 2 2 basic principles the model is based on deb theory for describing the energetics of individuals the deb model describes how individuals feed allocate energy for growth and reproduction and die of aging and or starvation the degree of food limitation in our model depends on both fish density and the logistic growth parameter for food we introduced predation as a third external source of mortality because deb theory only represents mortality due to aging and starvation at each time step if a randomly selected number continuous uniform distribution u 0 1 is less than the stage specific probability of dying from predation then the organism dies see si 2 part 2 7 1 in this study we considered a stage specific density independent predation mortality rate and an indirect competition for food from which emerged density dependence the source of density dependence in population regulation can come from both predation and competition while competition is always density dependent predation is not hixon et al 2002 to observe density dependent prey mortality the predator must have a regulating total response combination of numerical response functional response and other responses to changes in prey abundance hixon et al 2002 murdoch and oaten 1975 sinclair and pech 1996 in experimental tests that were designed to test for predation or competition as the source of density dependence competition was more often density dependent than predation hixon and jones 2005 moreover the fish literature contains examples of both density dependent anderson 2001 steele and forrester 2002 and density independent predation hixon and carr 1997 steele and forrester 2002 2 3 entities state variables and scales there are two types of entities in the model individual fish and spatial unit we used the scaled version of the deb model with metabolic acceleration to represent the energy budget of individuals individuals are characterized by six state variables namely structure l in cm scaled reserve u e d cm2 scaled maturity u h d cm2 scaled reproduction u r d cm2 damage inducing compounds q expressed as aging acceleration and damage h expressed as hazard rate all the equations and parameters of the deb model are available in the supplemental material si 2 sections 2 and 3 for more details and an introduction to deb theory see nisbet et al 2000 van der meer 2006 sousa et al 2010 jusup et al 2016 we introduced a normally distributed scatter multiplier μ 1 and σ 0 05 to account for inter individual variability in six of the standard deb parameters half saturation coefficient energy investment ratio the scaled maturity thresholds for hatching birth metamorphosis and puberty see si 2 part 2 4 9 the model has one spatial unit representing a 10 ha zone of a river this zone is characterized by three quantitative state variables the prey density x j cm 2 temperature t in c and surface area in m2 prey density changes once during each daily time step according to a logistic growth equation and fish consumption the logistic growth function has two parameters daily intrinsic growth rate a e in d 1 and the carrying capacity k e in j m 2 temperature is the same in the entire zone range from 0 9 to 24 4 c during the year and changes daily according to online temperature data that were recorded in 2015 in kawishiwi river mn https waterdata usgs gov nwis this river is located at the northern frontier of the great lakes basin and has a temperature profile that is characteristic of this zone all the parameters and equations of the ibm are available in supplemental materials si 2 sections 2 and 3 2 4 simulations we ran five 20 year simulations for each of the 109 system types that we modeled one that did not involve a stressor and four in which a stressor impacted a specific pmoa growth reproduction maintenance or assimilation at one of four levels of severity 6 25 12 5 25 or 50 we replicated each combination of system stressor and severity 20 times see si 2 part 7 1 for justification on number of replicates all simulations began with a 4 year phase in period that involved introducing new individuals during each reproductive season if a simulation involved a stressor we initiated a 5 year exposure at the start of year 15 2 5 observations and analysis we collected observations on fish in the size range from 1 5 to 9 8 cm density eggs per female the fulton condition index for adults ratio of weight to cubic length total biomass for fish in the targeted size range the number of deaths by predation starvation or aging and population size distribution psd ratio of the number of individuals bigger than 4 5 cm over the number of individuals bigger than 1 5 cm i e the ratio of adults in the population we calculated a starvation index si as the proportion of dead individuals that died from starvation over the last 5 years of a simulation without stressor the si reflected the extent to which the population was top down or bottom up controlled fig 2 for example a low si means that relatively few individuals are dying of starvation which is typical during top down i e predator control we calculated changes in population size abundance of fish in the targeted size range total biomass and eggs per year by comparing average values over the last 5 years of stressed and unstressed simulations of the same system and using the same initial conditions and stochasticity i e the same seed if a stressor affects individuals we expect to see some effects on the population growth rate we calculated the daily per capita growth rate pcgr as the daily change in total biomass of individuals between 1 5 and 9 8 cm divided by the number of individuals in this size range this standard measure allowed us to compare population growth rate across different combinations of predation and food control i e different population sizes we linked the pcgr to different intervals of population density 20 intervals population density ranging from 0 to 10 000 according to the population density on the day of the computation because the relationship was convex see si 2 part 7 4 we fitted the following logarithmic function with a linear regression using the r function lm with default arguments 1 log pcgr a dd s log fd where fd is fish population density a was estimated for every system but was held constant when comparing stressed and unstressed systems dds which represents the strength of the density dependence was estimated for every system and stress condition the underlying idea was that stress would change the strength of the density dependence only we only included populations in which the average abundance was 4000 individuals to avoid low goodness of fit because small sized populations did not have enough data points 3 results our results show that the effects of stressors on populations are rarely proportional to the intensity level of stressors on individuals the magnitude of the impact on a population depends on the strength of the stressor the pmoa on which the stressor is acting and the degree to which a population is predator controlled as measured by the starvation index si populations in which individuals experienced a 25 increase in the cost of reproduction exhibited a 5 reduction in population size for most values of the starvation index reductions 5 were only observed if the population was mostly predator controlled si values close to 0 fig 3 a variability in the magnitude of the response was also highest when si was low we observed a similar population level response for a 25 increase in maintenance costs fig 3b conversely population size was uniformly variable and decreased almost linearly with si for a 25 reduction in feeding rate fig 3c beginning from a net increase in population size for si values larger than 0 11 i e in food limited populations finally the population level response to a 25 increase in the cost of growth fig 3d was intermediate to these extremes the shape of the loess regression lines between population size change and the starvation index indicates the proportion of populations that are at risk most of the populations that were impacted through reproduction fig 3a or maintenance fig 3b showed a 5 decline in population size the number of populations that showed a 5 decline in population size was much larger when exposed to a stressor that impacted feeding rate fig 3c or cost of growth fig 3d the proportion of populations at risk also changed with the intensity of the stressor effect fig 4 and included a threshold stressor intensity above which there was a sharp increase in the impact on population size and the number of populations at risk increasing the intensity of a stressor affecting reproduction fig 4a or maintenance fig 4b tended to increase the negative impact on predation controlled populations other populations in these pmoa scenarios did not show large impacts until the stressor intensity increased from 25 to 50 stressor effects extended beyond predator controlled populations at lower intensities when affecting feeding rate fig 4c and cost of growth fig 4d we identified demographic traits that were correlated with the population declines observed in figs 3 and 4 the population size distribution fig 5 is the ratio between adults individuals 4 5 cm and all individuals size larger than 1 5 cm consequently a larger value means that the proportion of adults is higher the fulton index or k index fig 6 is the ratio between individual weight and its cubic length higher k values indicate that individuals are in better condition regardless of pmoa the most vulnerable populations i e predation controlled populations tended to contain lower proportions of adults fig 5 that were relatively heavy for a given length fig 6 prior to the introduction of the stressor a stressor induced change in dd s is a proportional measure of the extent to which a population response includes variation in the strength of density dependence fig 7 large population changes tended to be associated with increases in the strength of density dependence for all pmoas except for reproduction fig 7a the predation controlled populations in red showed the largest increases whereas the food controlled populations in blue showed the smallest increases the range of stressor induced decline in population size is dependent on the pmoa nevertheless the intensity of the change in dd s results in a similar population size change for the different pmoas except for cost of reproduction for instance a 4 increase in dds is associated with about a 30 decrease in population size when a stressor impacts maintenance costs fig 7b feeding rate fig 7c or cost of growth fig 7d 4 discussion in this study we investigated how stressors acting on different modes of action at the individual level resulted in population level effects in systems that varied in the relative importance of predation and food as controlling factors our results confirm that population level responses are rarely proportional to individual level responses and depend on whether the population is controlled by predation or food availability the latter was largely due to the inability of predation controlled populations to exhibit compensatory density dependent responses we also found that stressor pmoa and intensity influence the extent to which the systems are impacted and the proportion of systems that are at risk of significant population decrease the effects of stressors are frequently measured at the individual and sub individual levels köhler and triebskorn 2013 even though conservation goals are expressed at higher levels of biological organization e g population community regardless of pmoa individual level impacts for example on growth and or egg production are not proportional to the percent change in energy assimilation or metabolic costs martin et al 2013 2014 consequently our results figs 3 and 4 are consistent with previous studies gergs et al 2013 galic et al 2017 schmolke et al 2017 that show that population level effects are not proportional to individual level responses the tendency of the moderately to strongly food limited populations to increase in size figs 3 and 4 in response to a stressor is a good illustration of this non proportionality this hydra effect sensu abrams 2009 results from compensatory mechanisms the strength of which depends on the considered system different systems have different population dynamics emerging from interactions among individuals and with their environment and thus exhibit different demographic traits our deb ibm approach allowed us to relate different demographic traits to population decline regardless of pmoa we saw that impacts were smallest in populations that had a low k index prior to stress fig 6 in other words individuals in these systems did not grow and reproduce optimally because resource density had a strong control over population size consequently any stress induced decrease in food competition will have a positive impact on population size for instance fish produce fewer eggs and therefore fewer new individuals when the stressor increases the cost of reproduction the subsequent decline in food competition meant that individuals grew faster reached a larger size and produced more eggs less impacted populations are also those with the higher psd fig 5 meaning that they had proportionally more adults adults buffered populations from the individual level impact of a stressor because they are able to convert the additional energy that resulted from a reduction in competition for food into eggs see supplemental material si 1 part 2 alternatively there was little compensation when populations were controlled by predation pressure both juveniles and adults in these systems were less abundant as a result of predation moreover they were already reproducing and growing optimally i e close to their biological maximum before the stressor was applied our results show that the range of variation of population level impacts changes when considering different pmoas figs 3 and 4 for instance pmoas that cause a delay in maturation increased cost of growth increased costs of maintenance decreased feeding rate had greater population level impacts because early life stages are more susceptible to predation the strength of the reduction in competition for food also differs because different pmoas impact individuals differently which will induce different consequences on population dynamics at the individual level pmoas have an effect on somatic and or reproductive pathways martin et al 2013 2014 which will alter growth and or reproductive outputs for example in deb theory when the cost of reproduction is impacted growth is not affected the production of eggs is reduced due to a loss of efficiency in converting the energy buffer for reproduction into eggs but the amount of energy allocated to growth is not altered because assimilation depends on the length of the organism the integrated amount of ingested food over the whole life span of an organism will remain the same on the contrary when growth or maintenance costs increase both individual growth and reproduction are impacted and the integrated amount of ingested food over the whole life span of an organism will be reduced when feeding rate decreases growth and reproduction are both affected but in this case the organism takes up less energy instead of spending more here again the integrated amount of ingested food over the whole life span of an organism will be reduced these different individual level impacts have different consequences at the population level when the cost of reproduction is affected only the number of produced eggs is impacted as they are costlier to produce in this case there will be fewer individuals in the system due to lower recruitment resulting in an overall population decline increasing maintenance costs causes slower organism growth and maturation consequently individuals stay longer in early developmental stages which are more vulnerable to predation this is also the case when the cost of growth increases because smaller individuals get less food and thus have less energy available for maturation meanwhile as smaller organisms take up less energy there is more food in the system and thus more organisms can survive resource competition when feeding rate is affected less food is consumed and stays in the system nevertheless even if the strength of competition for food is reduced the remaining food is not accessible by organisms so it has no benefit and compensation does not occur our results highlight the importance of determining the pmoa of a stressor at the individual level because population level responses for different pmoas can differ markedly in fact the proportion of populations at risk as well as the intensity of the population level impact are highly dependent on the pmoa of the stressor at the individual level see differences between panels in figs 3 and 4 for instance we observed that a stressor impacting the feeding rate of individuals would systematically result in a stronger decrease in population size for every stressor level compared to any other pmoa fig 4 moreover the proportion of potentially highly impacted populations is also higher when considering this pmoa martin et al 2014 noted that measuring individual level outputs such as growth rate or egg production was not sufficient to determine the pmoa of a stressor because a similar decrease in one of these individual level outputs could be caused by different pmoas our results support the added value of assessing other physiological processes such as respiration to understand which pmoa is affected at the individual level our results also indicate the importance of considering both food availability and predation pressure when natural resource managers assess the potential impact of a stressor because they both contribute to density dependent mechanisms that can impact population growth rate population growth rate provides a more relevant measure of ecological impact of stressors than individual level measurements because it integrates potentially complex interactions occurring at lower levels of biological organization forbes and calow 1999 our results show that exposure to stressors systematically changes the strength of density dependence and that the intensity of the change is directly related to population size change fig 7 an identical stress level for different pmoas results in different population changes depending on how a population is regulated fig 3 but a similar change in the intensity of the pcgr density dependence appears to produce similar population declines for different pmoas fig 7 a stressor impact on reproduction cost resulted in a decrease in the intensity of density dependence because it is the pmoa that has the strongest population level compensatory mechanism for the other pmoas stressed populations always showed an increase in the strength of density dependence other studies have focused on population level effects in different system contexts in accordance with our results a study that considered the effects of food density moe et al 2002 found that blowfly populations at high densities and therefore lower food availability showed a positive effect when exposed to cadmium our results are also similar to an empirical study showing strong ecological compensation in response to toxic chemicals at low food levels but an increase in extinction probability in unlimited food conditions barata et al 2002 other experimental studies gui and grant 2008 beketov and liess 2005 show similar results but some experiments showed that food limitation can exacerbate toxicant effects linke gamenick et al 1999 pieters et al 2005 for instance martin et al 2014 found that low productivity environments had lower capacity to buffer stress in daphnia magna whereas experiments by relyea and mills 2001 relyea 2004 showed that predator induced stress increased the susceptibility of tadpoles to chemical stress experiments by coors and de meester 2008 found that predation stress acted antagonistically with chemical stress in daphnia magna these inconsistencies in the relationship between density dependence and responses to stressors may at least in part be due to the constraints of different study designs forbes et al 2001 and further work is needed to determine the conditions under which density dependence exacerbates or ameliorates the responses of populations to stress despite the importance of understanding the influence of natural drivers such as predation and competition on the responses of populations to toxic chemicals field studies are rare and results variable for example johnson and chen 2017 compared historic fisheries data with predicted estrogen exposure and concluded that estrogen contained in wastewater did not lead to a catastrophic decline in four species of cyprinid fish in one of very few controlled field experiments of its kind kidd et al 2007 observed a collapse of a fathead minnow population in a lake after long term exposure to high concentrations of estrogen although this experiment was performed with estrogen concentrations an order of magnitude higher than those generally found in rivers downstream of treated sewage discharges matthiessen et al 2018 it is interesting that the population collapse was not observed for three other fish species kidd et al 2014 there is growing recognition that wildlife populations are exposed to complex mixtures of chemicals the impacts of which are unclear for example recent studies in the great lakes basin have detected the presence of large numbers of agricultural and urban cecs in tributaries elliott et al 2018 cipoletti et al 2019 and some of these contaminants have been found to have effects on individual fish in laboratory experiments baldwin et al 2016 thomas et al 2017 cipoletti et al 2019 thomas et al 2017 documented the biological effects of cecs on resident and caged fish across 27 field sites in six great lakes tributaries and highlighted that biological responses were different between these two groups they argued that caged fish were in a better nutritional status before the exposure which could have contributed to their different response our results show that population characteristics e g population structure fig 5 as well as individual characteristics e g adult condition index fig 6 vary depending on how the population is regulated and we were able to relate these characteristics to population level impacts it is important to note that a population is defined as being predation or food controlled based on the balance of these two factors not on the presence or even degree of predation or food limitation a population that is in a high predator or high food environment can either be top down or bottom up controlled we show in the supplemental material si 2 part 7 3 that parameters defining food density and predation pressure are not correlated with the starvation index our work used deb theory which is a standardized generic model that describes the metabolism of all species kooijman 2010 using this methodology to describe the growth and reproduction of individual fish in the ibm is relevant because these processes are not directly dependent on food availability in deb theory consequently how individuals grow reproduce and survive in different systems are emergent properties of the model and not based on a priori hypotheses although our work relied on deb theory which provides a common model structure that applies to all species extrapolating from the physiological processes that are captured in deb to individual level properties and population level consequences is species dependent species vary widely in their sensitivity to stressors at the individual level baas and kooijman 2015 and differences in ecology between species can impact population level effects of stressors recent findings highlighted that even closely related species that have similar individual level stressor responses for a given pmoa can exhibit large differences in population level effects in terms of both population size and biomass accolla et al 2019 future work should evaluate the generality of our results with respect to other species we also encourage research to evaluate the population level impacts of a stressor for various food web scenarios e g strong versus weak interspecific competition ideally when predators competitors and prey are also vulnerable to the stressor we recognize that stressors do not always occur in isolation but can combine to produce complex population level effects galic et al 2017 2018 we also encourage the setup of laboratory experiments for example one could conduct lab or mesocosm experiments in which food availability and predation are strictly controlled the population sizes of these different populations would need to be independent of the strength of the controlling factors and the treatment would involve the introduction of a standardized stressor once population dynamics are stabilized our results may be impacted by how we represented predation in the model we chose to represent predation mortality as stage specific and density independent because it is the simplest hypothesis and therefore we could better understand the behavior of this first version of the model compensation would also have been observed if we had considered a density dependent mortality due to predation as shown by another study involving a fish ibm which included density dependent mortality rate mintram et al 2018 furthermore there is no guarantee to the intuitive idea that the observed difference between predation and food controlled systems when exposed to a stressor is due to the fact that predation is density independent in the model first density dependence of predation can occur for multiple reasons because predation is a complex phenomenon that involves many biological and ecological processes when a stressor is introduced it may or may not act on one or several of these processes moreover even if no change due to a stressor on density dependent predation induced mortality was considered predation controlled systems may remain more sensitive the reason is that predation controlled systems do not necessarily have the strongest predation mortality rates see si 2 part 7 3 what defines how a system is controlled is the balance between predation pressure and food availability and what defines how a system will be impacted is how this balance will be impacted consequently we encourage more detailed studies on this subject in summary our study uses an ibm to infer population level responses to stressors in different population types from individual level effects other published studies report diverse population level effects of predation pressure and food density when considering the effect of a stressor martin et al 2014 moe et al 2002 relyea 2004 coors and de meester 2008 our study contributes to this literature by considering both factors simultaneously and by varying both the strength of the stressor and the pmoa our results suggest that top down controlled populations are more vulnerable than bottom up controlled populations and that stressors that reduce feeding rate impact a larger proportion of populations and in a stronger way than any other pmoas this finding is consistent with growing evidence that it is difficult to infer population level effects from individual level effects without an estimate of the relative importance of bottom up and top down controls on population size our study offers a theoretical approach that isolates the interplay of stressor effects with interacting factors predation and competition for food that regulate population size highlighting how mechanisms of compensation can differ in different systems consequently our results showing that population level responses depend on how populations are regulated are potentially generalizable to other species and stressors our model focuses on a single species and stressor in the absence of complex food web dynamics as an important first step in providing initial insight and generating testable hypotheses our model and models like it are valuable tools for exploring interactions between stressors and other factors that control populations over relevant spatial and temporal scales while reducing animal testing and the ethical concerns involved therein these models are versatile in that they can handle any shape of dose response relationship including those that are non monotonic in addition to estimating the population level impact of an effect they can also be used to back calculate effect levels i e thresholds at the individual level that would result in unacceptable population level impacts declaration of interests none

24938,the cultivation of energy crops leads to direct and indirect land use changes that impair the biodiversity of the agricultural landscape in our study we analyse the effects of mitigation measures on the european brown hare lepus europaeus which is directly affected by ongoing land use change and has experienced widespread decline throughout europe since the 1960s therefore we developed a spatially explicit and individual based ecological model to study the effects of different landscape configurations and compositions on hare population development as an input we used two 4 4 km large model landscapes which were generated by a landscape generator based on real field sizes and crop proportions and differed in average field size and crop composition the crops grown annually are evaluated in terms of forage suitability breeding suitability and crop richness for the hare in six mitigation scenarios we investigated the effects of a 10 increase in the following measures 1 mixed silphie 2 miscanthus 3 grass clover ley 4 alfalfa 5 set aside and 6 general crop richness all mitigation measures had significant effects on hare population development compared to the base scenario the relative change in hare abundance ranged from a factor of 0 56 in the grass clover ley scenario to 0 16 in the miscanthus scenario the mitigation measures of mixed silphie grass clover ley and increased crop richness led to distinct increases in hare abundance in both landscapes 0 3 the results show that both landscape configuration and composition have a significant effect on hare population development which responds particularly strongly to compositional changes the increase in crop diversity e g through the cultivation of alternative energy crops such as mixed silphie and grass clover ley proves to be beneficial for the brown hare keywords agent based modelling mitigation measures agriculture european brown hare land use change lepus europaeus 1 introduction the increased cultivation of energy crops in europe in recent years has led to extensive direct and indirect land use changes which have an important but not yet quantified impact on biological diversity dauber et al 2010 in particular land competition triggered by biomass cultivation affects other forms of land use such as conventional food production organic farming set aside and biotope connectivity harvey and pilgrim 2011 steinhausser et al 2015 dauber and miyake 2016 the associated land use changes lead to reduced habitat diversity heterogeneity and increasing field margins and fringe structures are lost due to the expansion and merging of fields butler et al 2010 brandt and glemnitz 2014 in connection with the ongoing intensification of agriculture many animal species are threatened in their habitats e g de chazal and rounsevell 2009 sauerbrei et al 2014 while there are numerous studies on the effects of land use change on birds e g lemoine et al 2007 butler et al 2010 studies on mammals are rare the european brown hare lepus europaeus is an important representative of the agricultural landscape and its population has been declining in europe since the 1960s edwards et al 2000 smith et al 2005a 2005b zellweger fischer et al 2011 studies have shown that the brown hare has been directly affected by the intensification of agriculture and its side effects in recent decades these impacts include a higher proportion of monocultures on larger fields the loss of crop diversity and semi natural habitats and more intensive management activities e g smith et al 2005a 2005b baldi and farago 2007 pepin and angibault 2007 however there is still a considerable need for research to clarify the causes of these impacts despite extensive wildlife studies in recent decades estimates and evaluations of population trends are still not sufficiently possible due to the lack of long term and large scale population data smith et al 2005a 2005b to understand the ecological significance of agricultural effects on brown hare populations and the causes of their widespread decline habitat use in space and time must be studied more intensively rühe and hohmann 2004 strauß et al 2008 agricultural fields serve as both foraging and reproduction habitat for the brown hare for foraging hares select arable crops e g wheat barley and sugar beet and weeds e g clover and corn poppy especially after cereal crops are harvested reichlin et al 2006 during most of the breeding season hares prefer arable crops and habitat structures that provide cover from predators and unfavourable weather conditions and this practice is particularly important for the survival of leverets smith et al 2004 thus their life cycle is directly dependent on the configuration landscape structure and composition arable crops and other land use types as well as the management of the fields the area under energy crop cultivation in germany has increased considerably in the last 20 years destatis 2018 energy crops are mainly used for biogas and biofuel production with maize being the most important crop for use in biogas plants and oilseed rape for the production of biofuels maize 18 2 of arable land in 2017 winter rape 11 2 and winter wheat 26 6 dominate german agriculture destatis 2018 however most of the maize is silage maize for feed production the negative effects of the large scale cultivation of energy crops and the associated land use change on biodiversity have been described in numerous studies e g gevers et al 2011 everaars et al 2014 petrovan et al 2017 maize and rape are often cultivated in large monocultures and above a certain height of vegetation they are not only not suitable for foraging but also too dense for hares as a consequence large areas of their home ranges are rendered useless and hares have to move longer distances to more favourable habitats lewandowski and nowakowski 1993 an additional effect of the increased proportion of energy crops is a lower overall diversity of arable crops on the landscape and the expansion of arable land to include marginal lands both crop diversity and marginal lands are important habitat characteristics for the brown hare mayer et al 2018 the european union is trying to limit the negative effects of land use change on agricultural biodiversity through the use of various policies such as the greening of farming regulation eu no 1307 2013 farmers receive an area based payment for various farming practices that benefit the environment and the climate including diversifying crops maintaining permanent grassland and dedicating 5 of arable land to ecologically beneficial elements i e ecological focus areas efas however recent studies suggest that the current measures are not sufficient to adequately protect the biodiversity of agricultural landscapes pe er et al 2014 2017 in this study we want to analyse and compare the benefits of a range of different greening measures that are eligible as efas in the framework of the eu agricultural subsidy for the brown hare in particular this is the cultivation of the alternative energy crops of mixed silphie silphium perfoliatum miscanthus miscanthus x giganteus and grass clover ley the cultivation of the legume alfalfa medicago sativa and the increase of set aside and crop diversification empirically investigating land use scenarios on a larger spatial scale is very time consuming and is associated with a high effort therefore spatially explicit simulation models are useful tools for testing and analysing different configurations and compositions of agricultural landscapes o sullivan and perry 2013 by using a defined parameter set different agricultural landscape mosaics can be generated which serve as a basis for controlled simulation experiments langhammer et al 2019 using a modelling approach we want to answer the following questions 1 what effects do selected mitigation measures have on long term hare population development 2 is an individual based simulation model that works with simplified generated landscapes able to produce robust predictions for hare population development for this purpose the effects of different crop distributions on hare population abundance were analysed using three habitat evaluation criteria suitability as forage habitat suitability as breeding habitat and regional crop richness the crop distributions are based on data from a reference landscape in brandenburg and the average crop distribution for germany in 2017 based on the results specific solutions for sustainable mitigation measures and the protection of the brown hare will be identified 2 methods we analysed the effects of different mitigation measures in agricultural landscapes on the brown hare therefore we developed an individual based simulation model which is implemented in netlogo 6 0 3 wilensky 1999 and available in the comses computational model library langhammer and grimm 2019 1 1 the design of the model is in parts adopted from the animal functional type aft model from scherer et al 2016 and the model from engel et al 2012 which was further developed by everaars et al 2014 input included landscape configurations which differed in the size and spatial distribution of fields created by the landscape generator from engel et al 2012 and everaars et al 2014 2 1 landscape generation the applied landscape generator was originally developed to evaluate the impacts of cropping scenarios on different farmland bird species engel et al 2012 everaars et al 2014 the model workflow consists of several subsequent steps whereby only the first part of the workflow the landscape mosaic generation was used in this study a complete model description can be found in the original publications the landscape generator generates a mosaic of agricultural fields with varying shapes sizes and edge lengths fig 1 whereby the landscape configuration depends on the mean field size in ha the generation takes place in two steps first fields are placed randomly on the landscape grid until all of the area is covered second a correction algorithm replaces all fields that are too small by merging them with neighbouring fields the emerging field mosaic is adapted to the specified mean field size for this study the landscape extent is 4 km 4 km with a resolution of 100 m² 400 400 grid cells 2 1 1 reference landscapes the configuration of the reference landscape uckermark is based on data from a 213 km² area in brandenburg north eastern germany the area is part of the long term research platform agroscapelab quillow agricultural landscape laboratory quillow of the leibniz centre for agricultural landscape research zalf and the biomove research training group dfg grk 2118 1 uckermark is characterised by large fields with an average field size of 27 5 ha and a simple landscape structure ullmann et al 2018 for comparison a second reference landscape was created from the average data of germany the literature provides no average field sizes for germany but brady et al 2012 assumes that there is a proportional correlation between field size and farm size in 2016 the average farm size in germany was 61 ha of agricultural land and in the uckermark 247 ha destatis 2018 accordingly we assume an average field size of 6 8 ha for our model landscape germany this makes the field mosaic in germany much more small scaled and heterogeneous than that in uckermark fig 1 2 2 hare model description this model description follows the odd overview design concepts details protocol for describing individual based models grimm et al 2006 2010 2 2 1 purpose the model aims to evaluate the quality of different agricultural land use patterns for the european brown hare lepus europaeus in two representative landscapes the effectiveness of different mitigation measures in bioenergy driven landscapes is explored these measures include alternative energy crops and other measures to increase habitat diversity 2 2 2 entities state variables and scales the model includes two types of entities square grid cells and individuals hares table 1 gives an overview of these entities and their state variables hares are characterised by the following key variables and parameters identity number owner location coordinates x and y at the centre of the grid cell they are on age status juvenile female male and home range area table 1 table 2 grid cells represent 100 m² and are characterised by their coordinates and the variables assigned to them to avoid edge effects the grid is wrapped to a torus each grid cell is covered by one of 14 crop species determined by the variable crop from which the variables 1 suitability as forage habitat foraging f h 2 suitability as breeding habitat breeding b h and 3 crop richness richness r c are derived the foraging and breeding values range from 0 0 not suitable to 1 0 very well suited and are based on expert knowledge drawn from the literature fig 2 table 3 if we did not find any information about a certain crop we derived the value of a similar crop e g for cereals or assumed a mean value of 0 5 an overview of the literature on the ecology of the brown hare which we have used to assess foraging and breeding preferences is given in the supplementary material suitability as forage habitat f h specifies the suitability of each crop species as a food source suitability as breeding habitat b h indicates the suitability of the crop species for getting offspring the value depends on crop density crop height and management activities crop richness r c indicates the distribution and quantity of crops within the landscape many studies show that habitat diversity in general including crop richness has a clear positive effect on hare populations tapper and barnes 1986 lewandowski and nowakowski 1993 reichlin et al 2006 santilli and galardi 2016 following this we related the crop richness value to the number of crops in three levels table 4 the values were chosen to implement a relationship between overall crop richness in the landscape and habitat suitability they represent the fact that habitat suitability does not only depend on local features within a habitat but also on the features of the surrounding landscape note that in our simulations only three values of r c were possible 0 6 for base landscapes with 10 crop species 0 8 for landscapes with one additional crop for mitigation and 1 0 when all 14 crop species listed in table 5 were present the geometric mean of all three variables f h b h r c results in the habitat suitability value s h for each individual grid cell fig 2 s h f h b h r c 3 the hare home ranges in the model landscapes are distributed in a circular shape around the individuals females and males have the same home range size in the model although it can be different in reality because the model proceeds in annual steps juveniles do not have their own home range in the year of birth in the following year they are considered sexually mature and are looking for their own home range the home ranges of several individuals can overlap however a grid cell can only be assigned to the home range of a maximum of 10 hares fig 3 for each additional hare that marks a cell belonging to its home range the habitat suitability value of the cell is reduced by 0 02 both parameters homerangeoverlap and suitabilityreduction as well as other unknown parameters table 2 were estimated by calibrating the model with the hare counts in the reference landscape in the uckermark of 5 individuals per 100 ha data provided by the biomove research training group dfg grk 2118 1 they indirectly simulate competition for habitat and avoid unnatural clumping of too many individuals per area in small scale heterogeneous landscapes home ranges are smaller than those in landscapes with large monocultures following ullmann et al 2018 we set the hare home ranges in the brandenburg scenarios to 55 ha another landscape in south germany bavaria investigated by ullmann et al 2018 with an average field size of 3 ha showed an average hare home range of 19 ha based on these data we interpolated the presumed average value of germany to be 25 ha this value is comparable to the values of 21 ha in rühe and hohmann 2004 and 29 ha in broekhuizen and maaskamp 1981a 1981b a home range of 25 ha corresponds to a radius of 28 grid cells 280 m in the model germany i e a home range of 55 ha to 42 grid cells 420 m in uckermark a time step in the model represents one year and simulations are usually run for 80 time steps 2 2 3 process overview and scheduling in each time step tick the following submodels are called in the specified order the names of the corresponding submodels are printed in italics and are used both in the submodels section and in the program used a flowchart of the model process is depicted in fig 4 first all hares become one year older and juveniles become young adults aging new adults then try to establish a home range establish home range they have three attempts to find a grid cell where they can establish a home range with a suitability about the suitabilitythreshold if they fail they die adults that reached their maximum age die die of longevity in the next step the crop species are reassigned to all fields each year cultivation the selection of the crop species per field depends on the field size and the determined crop proportions for each scenario i e no specific crop rotations are taken into account however the proportion of a crop species in the entire landscape remains the same throughout each simulation run for each scenario next the landscape is evaluated from the perspective of the hare evaluation depending on the crop species the variables foraging breeding and richness are calculated for each grid cell calculate suitability the mean value of all habitat suitability values s h within the home range describes the general suitability of the home range as a habitat calculate suithomerange in the next step all hares search within their home range for a suitable position search homerange to do this the individuals search for suitable patches as start patches within the home range the search radius is limited to the home range because hares are a sedentary species and studies show that they do not significantly expand their home range if their energy requirements are not covered smith et al 2005a 2005b bray et al 2007 the search patches must have a suitability above the thresholdsuitability which indicates the probability of survival and be occupied by 7 individuals maximum if these requirements are met the individual moves to the selected patch and installs its home range then the suitability of the entire home range is calculated if the hare fails three times in finding a new home range it dies failure occurs either through too low habitat quality or too many other individuals within the search radius next all females have 12 15 offspring marboutin et al 2003 reproduction finally mortality rates are applied for juveniles and adults survival mortality rates reflect the loss due to predation environmental impacts e g weather conditions and accidents and are similar to the investigations of marboutin and peroux 1995 each simulation run ends after 80 years or when the population becomes extinct the individuals and grid cells are processed in a random order each time step to avoid priority effects 2 2 4 design concepts 2 2 4 1 basic principles a basic principle of the model is to assign home ranges according to the quality of the habitat e g carter et al 2015 in contrast to home range models that are based on tracking data e g nabe nielsen et al 2014 although in a simplified way by assuming fixed home range sizes the evaluation of habitat quality takes place within these fixed home ranges 2 2 4 2 emergence hare behaviour is largely imposed in terms of both home range establishment and selection and demographic rates 2 2 4 3 adaptation the hares have to adapt to changing habitat conditions due to a yearly changing crop pattern their home ranges are related to the habitat suitability of the arable crops if they are young adults or their habitat quality is not sufficient they must disperse to find a more suitable habitat therewith the hares respond to changes in landscape structure and overall hare abundance in an adaptive way 2 2 4 4 sensing the hares receive information about the habitat suitability of all cells of their home range furthermore they know their status juvenile female or male and age and are affected by the overall crop richness within the model landscape 2 2 4 5 interaction an individual can occupy a new home range only if the total number of individuals on each cell of the respective area is less than 10 this means that the hares compete indirectly for available land juvenile hares trying to establish a home range only select grid cells as staring points which are covered by less than 7 hare home ranges 2 2 4 6 stochasticity the configuration and composition of the landscapes is partly random 1 the agricultural fields are randomly distributed in the landscape by the landscape generator and 2 randomly assigned with crop species according to predefined percentages 3 the hares are processed in a random order each time step to avoid priority effects 4 the offspring are 50 female or male 5 during dispersal the target patch is randomly selected within the search radius 6 females obtain a random number between 12 and 15 offspring 7 hare age is random between 1 and 13 in the first time step all these elements of stochasticity are included to represent natural variation without going into the details of underlying mechanisms 2 2 4 7 observation the main output value is the average number of females and males for the last 50 years after the end of the simulation the first 30 years are discarded to avoid transient effects 2 2 5 initialization to initialize the model a landscape derived from a landscape generator written in c using embacadero rad studio 12 0 available upon request is imported as a text file the file must contain numerical values in a space separated table matching the dimensions of the model landscape from the graphical user interface gui the file input workflow is similar to the method presented in chapter 5 in railsback and grimm 2012 crop species are then distributed to the fields according to the chosen scenario from each crop species or rather the whole number of crops the variables 1 suitability as forage habitat 2 suitability as breeding habitat and 3 crop richness are derived the habitat suitability is calculated for each grid cell and the cells are coloured on a green range with the darkest hue marking the best suitability select habitat suitability view next a number of hares are distributed in the landscape according to the variable initialpopulation the default value is 80 hares corresponding to the data of the real landscape in brandenburg germany age is assigned randomly between 1 and 13 and gender is either female or male with the same probability after the first placement the hares search for a suitable position with sufficient habitat suitability within their home range and claim it if there is no position available the hare is removed from the grid 2 2 6 input data the model does not use any input data that would represent external factors that vary in time 2 2 7 submodels 2 2 7 1 ageing because the model follows an annual rhythm all individuals get one year older in each time step juveniles become young adults and search within a radius of 150 grid cells for their own home range establish home range if they do not succeed at three they die when individuals grow 13 years old they die die of longevity 2 2 7 2 cultivation each cell is assigned a new crop species fourteen different crop species are available for selection alfalfa barley beets grassland grass clover ley maize miscanthus oilseed rape pasture rye set aside mixed silphie triticale and wheat the proportion of a certain crop species in the landscape is defined by a cultivation probability with the selection of the crop species per field remaining the same throughout each simulation run for each mitigation scenario thus as in reality crops are assigned to the fields each year and an evaluation for the hare population takes place table 5 shows the cultivation probabilities of all crop species for each scenario 2 2 7 3 evaluation first the variables 1 suitability as forage habitat foraging f h 2 suitability as breeding habitat breeding b h and 3 crop richness richness r c are derived from each crop species or rather the whole number of crops table 3 and table 4 give an overview of the assessment criteria the geometric mean of all three variables f h b h r c results in the habitat suitability value s h for each individual grid cell s h f h b h r c 3 based on this value the mean habitat suitability of each hare home range is calculated in the next step the habitat suitability value of the home range is compared to the habitat suitability threshold of 0 5 which indicates the probability of survival 2 2 7 4 dispersal after crop cultivation each year all adult hares search within their home range for a suitable new position from where to establish a new home range therefore the individual selects a suitable cell in the home range habitat suitability 0 5 number of owners 7 and moves there then it calculates the mean habitat suitability for the prospective home range if it is sufficient the hare stays there and establishes its home range as a consequence habitat suitability is increased by 0 2 in all grid cells of the original home range and decreased by 0 2 in all cells of the new home range if the conditions do not apply the hare searches for a new target cell and tries to find a suitable home range in the same way if that does not work either it succeeds in the third try or dies juveniles that mature are searching for a home range within a radius of 150 cells 1 5 km prior to the assignment of new crop species their search radius is larger than that of the adults in order to find suitable grid cells outside the mother s home range the other rules applied here are similar to those for adults they search for a suitable grid cell defined by suitability and the requirement that no more than nine hares use this cell as part of their home range then if the suitability of the entire home range is such as with the adults too low they try again but die after the third unsuccessful attempt thus the number of adults alive before reproduction takes place is determined by habitat suitability which in turn depends on crop species field configurations and the density of conspecifics these factors affect hare distribution and abundance two times per year for establishing young adults and after new assignments of crops for established adults 2 2 7 5 reproduction every year sexually mature females get 12 15 offspring marboutin et al 2003 the number of offspring is selected at random 2 2 7 6 survival the individuals die after a maximum of 13 years of life they die earlier if the habitat suitability is not sufficient to feed them and they cannot find a new position offspring in the first year die when the mother dies in addition there is a fixed mortality rate to reflect predation environmental impacts e g weather conditions and accidents the mortality rate for juveniles is 20 higher than for adults marboutin and peroux 1995 2 3 scenarios the basis for our simulations are two recent crop distributions one of the reference landscapes in brandenburg um uckermark germany and one average distribution for germany in 2017 ger germany the crop data for uckermark gis invekos 2015 were provided by the leibniz centre for agricultural landscape research zalf because the proportions of the rarely cultivated crops 1 were too small to be consistent in the model landscape we selected the ten most common crops in total 97 cultivated in this landscape for the base scenario um the data for the german average scenario are derived from the federal statistical office germany destatis 2018 to compare both landscapes we also selected the ten most common crops for the base scenario ger in both landscapes the proportions of the ten most common crops were recalculated for the entire area table 5 however because the fields cannot be filled to the exact percentage there are minor deviations from the set values maize and winter oilseed rape are the most frequently cultivated energy crops in uckermark as well as in germany a total of 14 5 of maize is cultivated in the reference landscape in brandenburg most of it is silage maize for feed production 97 and 3 is used for biogas production however there is a high proportion of winter oilseed rape 18 1 mainly used for biofuel production the german average maize cultivation in 2017 was 15 8 of agricultural land but locally the proportion can be much higher approximately 5 of this is cultivated land is used for biogas production in contrast the german average of oilseed rape cultivation 7 4 of agricultural land is much lower than the percentage in the reference landscape in brandenburg to mitigate the negative effects of a high proportion of maize and oilseed rape on the brown hare we investigated various mitigation measures three of these measures focus on the effects of alternative energy plants mixed silphie ae1 miscanthus ae2 and grass clover ley ae3 and three on the effects of more beneficial crop compositions alfalfa cc1 set aside cc2 and crop richness cc3 we selected mixed silphie miscanthus and grass clover ley as alternative energy crops because they are considered to be more environmentally friendly than annual energy crops semere and slater 2007 dauber and miyake 2016 schorpp and schrader 2016 the asteraceae silphie silphium perfoliatum is bee friendly and can remain in the field for up to ten years under good conditions mixed silphie has a similar yield to that of maize and is therefore a realistic alternative for biogas production gansberger et al 2015 the reed grass miscanthus miscanthus x giganteus sometimes called elephant grass has a harvest period of over twenty years with its high biomass yield it is also a remarkable alternative for biofuel production kocar and civas 2013 by 2018 both mixed silphie and miscanthus are eligible for use on greening areas as a result of the mid term review of the common agricultural policy cap it can therefore be assumed that the proportion of both energy crops will continue to increase in the coming years for example the silphie cultivation has more than doubled to over 3000 ha in 2017 over than value in 2016 destatis 2018 grass clover ley is a mix of legumes and grasses which allows multiple harvesting with a high yield level of biomass it is used as livestock feed as well as for energy production in biogas plants stinner et al 2008 alfalfa medicago sativa is a forage legume for hares and it becomes important in the spring summer when the digestibility of cereals is reduced due to maturation or harvest that has taken place santilli et al 2014 set aside is considered a particularly high quality ecological measure which on the one hand creates valuable areas of protection and on the other hand opens up many possibilities for the cross linking of biotopes it has been identified in many studies as a favourable habitat for many animal species on the agricultural landscape and for the brown hare as it often has a high diversity of plants and is structurally heterogeneous reichlin et al 2006 gevers et al 2011 meichtry stier et al 2014 langhammer et al 2017 for the first five scenarios we increased the proportion of the respective crop or set aside to 10 each and reduced the proportion of maize mixed silphie and grass clover ley scenario and oilseed rape miscanthus alfalfa and set aside scenario accordingly the percentage of each crop in each scenario is shown in table 5 for the crop richness scenario cc3 we integrated all 14 crops into the landscape with a proportion of at least 5 each as a result we compared the six strategies regarding their mitigating effects to provide management recommendations for the protection of the brown hare 2 3 1 sensitivity analysis we conducted sensitivity experiments and spot checks data not shown i e varied key parameters over their full range and performed specific tests for single parameters while keeping all other parameters constant to understand how the variation affects model predictions during calibration it turned out that some parameters the radius of the home range homerangeradius the threshold for habitat suitability thresholdsuitability and the home range overlap homerangeoverlap were most sensitive to test the sensitivity we varied the values of the two parameters in the base scenario uckermark and the base scenario germany and calculated the resulting hare population abundance the thresholdsuitability parameter was varied from 0 to 1 in 0 1 interval steps the parameter homerangeradius varied from 10 to 50 grid cells in steps of five to test the influence of hare home range overlap we varied the number of possible overlaps from 0 to 20 hares in steps of two furthermore we performed sensitivity analysis by reducing the weighting of the crop richness criterion instead of weighting one third compared to forage and breeding suitability we tested one quarter one sixth and zero the sensitivity analyses were based on 100 replicates with the same input parameters as that of field size and number of crops 2 4 data analysis we ran each scenario for a total of 80 years however the population abundance was determined after only 30 years because the population had to stabilise in the first years thereafter the number of adults females and males was recorded annually from each scenario 100 replicates were run each replicate differed in the initial distribution of hares and crops in the landscape the total number of simulations was 1600 boxplots show the effects of the mitigation measures on the hare abundance for each landscape to compare and rank the effects of different mitigation measures we calculated the relative change of hare densities compared to the base scenario mann whitney u tests were performed for each scenario to test the significance of the changes all statistical calculations were carried out with r 3 4 3 r core team 2017 3 results due to model calibration the hare abundance in the base scenario uckermark 3 9 individuals per 100 ha is comparable to the hare counts in the reference landscape of 5 individuals per 100 ha data provided by the biomove research training group dfg grk 2118 1 in germany the mean abundance in the base scenario is approximately twice as high as that in uckermark 8 2 individuals per 100 ha comparisons with average data for germany are difficult because hare densities can differ greatly between regions strauss et al 2008 showed average population densities between 5 4 individuals per 100 ha in east germany and 23 9 individuals per 100 ha in northwest germany the average german hare density in 2016 was 12 individuals per 100 ha greiser et al 2018 all mitigation measures had significant effects p 0 001 on the hare population abundance table 6 fig 5 however the relative effect of the mitigation measures was slightly smaller in uckermark max 0 41 than in germany max 0 56 in general the mean standard deviation of all scenarios was slightly higher in germany 0 5 individuals per 100 ha than in uckermark 0 4 individuals per 100 ha 3 1 impact of alternative energy crops the relative effect of the alternative energy crops was significantly different in both landscapes fig 6 in uckermark the increase of the energy crops of mixed silphie and grass clover ley influenced the hare abundance most positively each 0 41 in comparison the energy crop of miscanthus had a minor positive effect 0 14 additionally in germany the increase of mixed silphie and grass clover ley had the largest positive effect on hare abundance 0 56 in contrast to uckermark miscanthus had a negative effect in germany 0 16 3 2 impact of modified crop compositions the relative effects of the other crop composition modifications were again smaller in uckermark max 0 26 than in germany max 0 53 fig 6 the most positive effect in both landscapes included the crop richness scenario but that in uckermark was only approximately half as that in germany 0 26 in uckermark 0 53 in germany alfalfa had a minor positive effect in both landscapes 0 08 in uckermark 0 12 in germany while the increase in set asides had a moderate effect of 0 19 in uckermark and 0 26 in germany overall the mitigation measures of mixed silphie grass clover ley and increased crop richness led to distinct increases in hare abundances in both landscapes 0 3 3 3 sensitivity analyses fig a1 in the appendix shows that a reduction of the hare home range radius in the model correlates with an increase in population abundance a small home range of 3 1 ha corresponding to a radius of 10 grid cells in the model leads to a hare density of 56 8 individuals per 100 ha in uckermark and 63 3 individuals per 100 ha in germany in turn a large home range of 78 5 ha corresponding to a radius of 50 grid cells in the model leads to low hare densities of 2 7 individuals per 100 ha in uckermark and 2 3 individuals per 100 ha in germany the threshold for habitat suitability strongly influences hare population development at a threshold higher than 0 4 the population abundances decrease rapidly until it dies out at a threshold of 0 7 in both landscapes fig a2 below a threshold of 0 5 the hare population stabilises at a density of 6 5 individuals per 100 ha in uckermark and 15 4 individuals per 100 ha in germany furthermore there is a strong correlation between the number of potential home range overlaps per grid cell in the model and the hare abundance a huge maximal overlap of 20 hare home ranges per grid cell leads to a population density of 4 4 individuals per 100 ha in uckermark and 8 9 individuals per 100 ha in germany fig a3 on the other hand when no overlap was allowed it led to a population density of 0 0 individuals per 100 ha in uckermark and 0 6 individuals per 100 ha in germany a reduction in the weighting of the crop richness criterion from less than 25 led to a strong decrease in the hare population abundances in both landscapes fig a4 it was weighted with one third in comparison to the forage and breeding suitability of a crop in the default settings of the model a reduction to zero led to the extinction of the hare populations in both landscapes 4 discussion we used an individual based model to investigate the influence of mitigation measures in agricultural landscapes on the brown hare the results show that it is possible to predict population development under modified habitat conditions using the model the examined scenarios resulted in different responses of the hare population from minor to large responses it turned out that not only the composition of the landscape the number and proportion of crops but also the configuration the field sizes play an important role in hare population development the model landscapes used in this study vary in field size and the proportion and distribution of crops in the german average landscape where the field sizes are significantly smaller than those in the uckermark mitigation measures had a stronger impact this result was mainly caused by the smaller hare home ranges in germany which allowed an overall higher population abundance on the landscape because the habitat requirements of hares are met more easily in small scale heterogeneous landscapes hares do not have to move long distances as in landscapes with large monocultures broekhuizen and maaskamp 1981a 1981b tapper and barnes 1986 rühe and hohmann 2004 smith et al 2004 bertolino et al 2013 within smaller home ranges hares benefit more quickly from mitigation measures as the probability of favourable crop species in their home range is higher thus smaller field sizes can be regarded as mitigation strategies by themselves in contrast the probability of favourable crop species decreases in landscapes with large fields the model results show that not only the configuration of the landscape affects hare population development but also the composition i e the number and distribution of the crop species bennett et al 2006 found that spatial configuration had less influence on biota than did the composition of a landscape in comparison fahrig et al 2011 recommend the consideration of a functional landscape heterogeneity in which compositional heterogeneity and configurational heterogeneity were examined separately and were species related to evaluate the crop species for the brown hare in the model we based our assessment on the literature unfortunately there were few concrete data available thus we mostly had to translate qualitative assessments into foraging and breeding values in the following we discuss the model results with regard to their consistency in relation to the literature references in uckermark the proportion of wheat which is a favourable crop for hares is much higher 37 5 than that in germany 20 7 winter wheat in the form of seedlings is especially important in spring pepin and angibault 2007 bertolino et al 2011 although the proportion of maize and rape in uckermark is comparably high 33 7 the negative effects are compensated by wheat therefore the addition of 10 hare friendly crops had a lower overall effect than that in germany in total the mitigation measures had a more moderate effect in uckermark and a stronger effect in germany this result indicates that the general composition of the landscape must be considered when mitigation measures are planned the mitigating effect depends not only on one crop replacement but also on the proportion and distribution of other crops in the landscape energy crop cultivation can be diversified with alternative energy crops the alternative energy scenarios show that mixed silphie and grass clover ley have a strong positive effect on hare population development while miscanthus has a little to a negative effect which is dependent on the landscape mixed silphie offers coverage for hares from the beginning of april if the stands are harvested by mid september the rootstock will form new rosette leaves until snow falls these scenarios offer good cover in autumn e g protection from wind rain and predators a perennial grass clover ley offers a high level of cover and forage availability to hares santilli 2006 and is more attractive than pastures frylestam 1986 clover as a forage legume becomes especially important in spring and summer when cereals start to ripen and their digestibility is reduced santilli et al 2014 or after they are harvested reichlin et al 2006 the bioenergy crop miscanthus even the young sprouts are entirely avoided as food petrovan et al 2017 the second part of crop composition measures also showed different effects i e from low to high the addition of the legume alfalfa had a minor effect in both landscapes although alfalfa is a forage plant for hares harvesting takes place several times a year leading to high leveret losses represented in the model by low breeding habitat suitability increasing set asides had a moderate positive effect in both landscapes set asides with low to medium height and favourable plant composition are a very important foraging habitat for hares reichlin et al 2006 gevers et al 2011 meichtry stier et al 2014 langhammer et al 2017 these landscapes offer a high amount and variety of wild herbs and grasses which are an essential part of the hare diet however if the vegetation becomes too high and dense hares avoid these areas schai braun et al 2013 the strongest positive effect of the crop composition measures in both landscapes was the increase in crop richness from 10 to 14 crops with at least a 5 proportion for each crop many studies demonstrate that brown hare populations are strongly positively influenced by habitat diversity variety of crops as they need protection and forage plants year round e g tapper and barnes 1986 lewandowski and nowakowski 1993 vaughan et al 2003 santilli and galardi 2016 our results show that an increase in crop richness in the landscape has a beneficial effect on hares as they have more opportunities to find year round forage and cover one way to achieve this benefit is to cultivate alternative energy crops that are beneficial for hares the extent to which the proportion of mitigation measures in a real landscape should be increased to stabilise the population in the long term would have to be investigated more precisely in further studies oppermann et al 2012 suggest 10 and meichtry stier et al 2014 at least 14 of areas should be covered by high quality agri environmental measures or semi natural habitats to sustainably protect agricultural biodiversity using the individual based hare model controlled simulation experiments can be performed and useful predictions can be made the results show that it is possible to achieve reliable results with the model even without a profound data background nevertheless the model is based on many simplifying assumptions which are often a compromise between resolution and data availability for example the landscapes are quite artificial and contain no landscape structures other than agricultural fields although hares are mainly found in fields 70 they also use other habitats such as meadows woodlands shrubby habitats and spontaneous vegetation 27 5 reichlin et al 2006 bertolino et al 2011 additionally field margins are a favourite foraging and breeding habitat due to the often higher diversity and height of growth in principle it is possible to represent landscape structure and dynamics with higher resolution e g by using a complex simulation system for hares and other animal species almass topping et al 2003 which simulates population development based on real landscapes at a spatial resolution up to 1 m² one advantage of almass is that even narrow landscape structures such as field margins can be mapped and the high temporal resolution of one day enables the precise representation of animal and management activities however due to the complexity the model is rather difficult to modify parameterize and analyse the implementation of mitigation measures in the model also represents a simplification in reality eligible greening measures are not implemented equally because farmers can choose among several options for example ecologically valuable edge structures such as field edges and buffer strips are implemented much less frequently than is the cultivation of eligible crops such as nitrogen fixing crops pe er et al 2017 in the model a time step represents one year even if the spring summer conditions are assumed because this is the period in which most breeding takes place tapper 1987 flux and angermann 1990 in reality crops are mainly used on a seasonal basis so that general statements regarding a crop species can be made only to a limited extent wheat is especially important in spring maize in spring and summer and stubble in autumn bertolino et al 2011 and reichlin et al 2006 show that in may more than 75 of the food supply consists of cereals in summer when the cereals have been harvested hares shift to other crops such as fabaceae grasses and herbs however the seasonal characteristics of crops are indirectly included in the model in the form of forage and breeding estimates to assess the suitability of crops as breeding habitats we considered conditions such as crop height and management activities in spring and summer we could not parameterize the weighting of the three criteria for forage breeding and crop richness because there are no data available for them however the sensitivity analysis shows that a reduction in the weighting of the crop richness criterion had a strong effect on hare population abundance this result underlines the importance of crop richness for population development however our assumptions on how crop richness in the entire model landscape affects local habitat suitability were largely imposed but do not affect the comparative assessment of different 10 or 11 crop species scenarios currently there seem to be no data available which would allow to replace these assumptions with more realistic and emergent ones other important population influencing factors are indirectly included as mortality rates in the model such as predation weather conditions and diseases the hare home ranges in the model do not emerge dynamically but are fixed with a certain radius it follows that despite relative adaptations to spatial conditions and seasons hares are a sedentary species and studies show that they do not significantly expand their home range if their energy requirements are not covered smith et al 2005a 2005b bray et al 2007 thus the hares in the model search only within their home ranges for a new more suitable place from which the new home range is created the number of attempts is a compromise between the probability of success to find a new place and the computing time it takes to perform this process for all hares and grid cells there are other models that use fixed home ranges for species e g for birds in scherer et al 2016 and everaars et al 2014 nevertheless there is a natural variation in home range size which depends on the landscape structure and food supply broekhuizen and maaskamp 1981a 1981b tapper and barnes 1986 rühe and hohmann 2004 smith et al 2004 bertolino et al 2013 following this the home ranges in uckermark are much larger than those in germany the overlap of home ranges of individual hares fluctuates strongly in reality in densely populated areas there is a strong overlap rühe and hohmann 2004 in the model the maximum overlap of ten home ranges was assumed to match the real population densities in the uckermark this indirectly controls the intraspecific competition which of course also affects the results population growth can only take place within the framework of this rule and is therefore limited nevertheless we assume that direct intraspecific competition in nature is also subject to similar though much more complex limiting factors estimates of the effects of mitigation measures on population development are usually related to agri environment schemes e g kleijn and sutherland 2003 donald and evans 2006 kleijn et al 2006 or other taxa such as plants birds or insects e g pryke and samways 2015 hille et al 2018 with regard to agri environmental measures there are few studies analysing the effects on brown hare populations zellweger fischer et al 2011 petrovan et al 2013 meichtry stier et al 2014 as cap reform s greening measures are a comparatively young policy instrument introduced by the 2013 cap reform reliable evaluations are rare a survey among 88 ecologists from 17 european countries in pe er et al 2017 resulted in recommendations for improved ecological effectiveness of greening measures gocht et al 2017 estimate the environmental impacts of biodiversity friendly farming practices in the context of cap greening as small although some regions are more positively affected than others regarding the brown hare one modelling approach exists that evaluates the effectiveness of ecological focus areas in danish landscapes langhammer et al 2017 the study found that a 5 coverage of an ecological focus area is insufficient to improve the living conditions of the brown hare to a substantial degree permanent set aside was identified as the most favourable ecological focus area with a relative increase in female abundance by a factor of 3 6 altogether more studies on the regional implementation and impact of greening measures are needed to make reliable assessments for the brown hare although the model presented here can be used to quickly assess rough trends of policy measures it does not replace the long term monitoring of hares 5 conclusion the hare model presented here opens up new possibilities to answer environmental questions in due time the impact of mitigation and policy measures on hare population development can be estimated on the basis of simplified generated landscapes furthermore the use of a landscape generator in combination with a species model allows the investigation of numerous landscape compositions and configurations the results show that both have a significant effect on the hare population whereby they respond particularly strongly to compositional changes the cultivation of alternative energy crops e g mixed silphie and grass clover ley allows the increase of diversity in the landscape which has proven to be highly beneficial for the brown hare the reduction of field sizes is also a strategy to positively affect hare population development as it increases local heterogeneity the future lies in agricultural landscape generators able to reproduce landscapes in even more detail to make more realistic predictions langhammer et al 2019 based on such tools and appropriate data sets assessment schemes that cover a range of landscapes management practices and species can be developed this purpose requires both the further development parameterization and testing of such spatial models and the collection of data and long term monitoring of species together both enable targeted analyses and predictions for the protection of biodiversity in agricultural landscapes declaration of

24938,the cultivation of energy crops leads to direct and indirect land use changes that impair the biodiversity of the agricultural landscape in our study we analyse the effects of mitigation measures on the european brown hare lepus europaeus which is directly affected by ongoing land use change and has experienced widespread decline throughout europe since the 1960s therefore we developed a spatially explicit and individual based ecological model to study the effects of different landscape configurations and compositions on hare population development as an input we used two 4 4 km large model landscapes which were generated by a landscape generator based on real field sizes and crop proportions and differed in average field size and crop composition the crops grown annually are evaluated in terms of forage suitability breeding suitability and crop richness for the hare in six mitigation scenarios we investigated the effects of a 10 increase in the following measures 1 mixed silphie 2 miscanthus 3 grass clover ley 4 alfalfa 5 set aside and 6 general crop richness all mitigation measures had significant effects on hare population development compared to the base scenario the relative change in hare abundance ranged from a factor of 0 56 in the grass clover ley scenario to 0 16 in the miscanthus scenario the mitigation measures of mixed silphie grass clover ley and increased crop richness led to distinct increases in hare abundance in both landscapes 0 3 the results show that both landscape configuration and composition have a significant effect on hare population development which responds particularly strongly to compositional changes the increase in crop diversity e g through the cultivation of alternative energy crops such as mixed silphie and grass clover ley proves to be beneficial for the brown hare keywords agent based modelling mitigation measures agriculture european brown hare land use change lepus europaeus 1 introduction the increased cultivation of energy crops in europe in recent years has led to extensive direct and indirect land use changes which have an important but not yet quantified impact on biological diversity dauber et al 2010 in particular land competition triggered by biomass cultivation affects other forms of land use such as conventional food production organic farming set aside and biotope connectivity harvey and pilgrim 2011 steinhausser et al 2015 dauber and miyake 2016 the associated land use changes lead to reduced habitat diversity heterogeneity and increasing field margins and fringe structures are lost due to the expansion and merging of fields butler et al 2010 brandt and glemnitz 2014 in connection with the ongoing intensification of agriculture many animal species are threatened in their habitats e g de chazal and rounsevell 2009 sauerbrei et al 2014 while there are numerous studies on the effects of land use change on birds e g lemoine et al 2007 butler et al 2010 studies on mammals are rare the european brown hare lepus europaeus is an important representative of the agricultural landscape and its population has been declining in europe since the 1960s edwards et al 2000 smith et al 2005a 2005b zellweger fischer et al 2011 studies have shown that the brown hare has been directly affected by the intensification of agriculture and its side effects in recent decades these impacts include a higher proportion of monocultures on larger fields the loss of crop diversity and semi natural habitats and more intensive management activities e g smith et al 2005a 2005b baldi and farago 2007 pepin and angibault 2007 however there is still a considerable need for research to clarify the causes of these impacts despite extensive wildlife studies in recent decades estimates and evaluations of population trends are still not sufficiently possible due to the lack of long term and large scale population data smith et al 2005a 2005b to understand the ecological significance of agricultural effects on brown hare populations and the causes of their widespread decline habitat use in space and time must be studied more intensively rühe and hohmann 2004 strauß et al 2008 agricultural fields serve as both foraging and reproduction habitat for the brown hare for foraging hares select arable crops e g wheat barley and sugar beet and weeds e g clover and corn poppy especially after cereal crops are harvested reichlin et al 2006 during most of the breeding season hares prefer arable crops and habitat structures that provide cover from predators and unfavourable weather conditions and this practice is particularly important for the survival of leverets smith et al 2004 thus their life cycle is directly dependent on the configuration landscape structure and composition arable crops and other land use types as well as the management of the fields the area under energy crop cultivation in germany has increased considerably in the last 20 years destatis 2018 energy crops are mainly used for biogas and biofuel production with maize being the most important crop for use in biogas plants and oilseed rape for the production of biofuels maize 18 2 of arable land in 2017 winter rape 11 2 and winter wheat 26 6 dominate german agriculture destatis 2018 however most of the maize is silage maize for feed production the negative effects of the large scale cultivation of energy crops and the associated land use change on biodiversity have been described in numerous studies e g gevers et al 2011 everaars et al 2014 petrovan et al 2017 maize and rape are often cultivated in large monocultures and above a certain height of vegetation they are not only not suitable for foraging but also too dense for hares as a consequence large areas of their home ranges are rendered useless and hares have to move longer distances to more favourable habitats lewandowski and nowakowski 1993 an additional effect of the increased proportion of energy crops is a lower overall diversity of arable crops on the landscape and the expansion of arable land to include marginal lands both crop diversity and marginal lands are important habitat characteristics for the brown hare mayer et al 2018 the european union is trying to limit the negative effects of land use change on agricultural biodiversity through the use of various policies such as the greening of farming regulation eu no 1307 2013 farmers receive an area based payment for various farming practices that benefit the environment and the climate including diversifying crops maintaining permanent grassland and dedicating 5 of arable land to ecologically beneficial elements i e ecological focus areas efas however recent studies suggest that the current measures are not sufficient to adequately protect the biodiversity of agricultural landscapes pe er et al 2014 2017 in this study we want to analyse and compare the benefits of a range of different greening measures that are eligible as efas in the framework of the eu agricultural subsidy for the brown hare in particular this is the cultivation of the alternative energy crops of mixed silphie silphium perfoliatum miscanthus miscanthus x giganteus and grass clover ley the cultivation of the legume alfalfa medicago sativa and the increase of set aside and crop diversification empirically investigating land use scenarios on a larger spatial scale is very time consuming and is associated with a high effort therefore spatially explicit simulation models are useful tools for testing and analysing different configurations and compositions of agricultural landscapes o sullivan and perry 2013 by using a defined parameter set different agricultural landscape mosaics can be generated which serve as a basis for controlled simulation experiments langhammer et al 2019 using a modelling approach we want to answer the following questions 1 what effects do selected mitigation measures have on long term hare population development 2 is an individual based simulation model that works with simplified generated landscapes able to produce robust predictions for hare population development for this purpose the effects of different crop distributions on hare population abundance were analysed using three habitat evaluation criteria suitability as forage habitat suitability as breeding habitat and regional crop richness the crop distributions are based on data from a reference landscape in brandenburg and the average crop distribution for germany in 2017 based on the results specific solutions for sustainable mitigation measures and the protection of the brown hare will be identified 2 methods we analysed the effects of different mitigation measures in agricultural landscapes on the brown hare therefore we developed an individual based simulation model which is implemented in netlogo 6 0 3 wilensky 1999 and available in the comses computational model library langhammer and grimm 2019 1 1 the design of the model is in parts adopted from the animal functional type aft model from scherer et al 2016 and the model from engel et al 2012 which was further developed by everaars et al 2014 input included landscape configurations which differed in the size and spatial distribution of fields created by the landscape generator from engel et al 2012 and everaars et al 2014 2 1 landscape generation the applied landscape generator was originally developed to evaluate the impacts of cropping scenarios on different farmland bird species engel et al 2012 everaars et al 2014 the model workflow consists of several subsequent steps whereby only the first part of the workflow the landscape mosaic generation was used in this study a complete model description can be found in the original publications the landscape generator generates a mosaic of agricultural fields with varying shapes sizes and edge lengths fig 1 whereby the landscape configuration depends on the mean field size in ha the generation takes place in two steps first fields are placed randomly on the landscape grid until all of the area is covered second a correction algorithm replaces all fields that are too small by merging them with neighbouring fields the emerging field mosaic is adapted to the specified mean field size for this study the landscape extent is 4 km 4 km with a resolution of 100 m² 400 400 grid cells 2 1 1 reference landscapes the configuration of the reference landscape uckermark is based on data from a 213 km² area in brandenburg north eastern germany the area is part of the long term research platform agroscapelab quillow agricultural landscape laboratory quillow of the leibniz centre for agricultural landscape research zalf and the biomove research training group dfg grk 2118 1 uckermark is characterised by large fields with an average field size of 27 5 ha and a simple landscape structure ullmann et al 2018 for comparison a second reference landscape was created from the average data of germany the literature provides no average field sizes for germany but brady et al 2012 assumes that there is a proportional correlation between field size and farm size in 2016 the average farm size in germany was 61 ha of agricultural land and in the uckermark 247 ha destatis 2018 accordingly we assume an average field size of 6 8 ha for our model landscape germany this makes the field mosaic in germany much more small scaled and heterogeneous than that in uckermark fig 1 2 2 hare model description this model description follows the odd overview design concepts details protocol for describing individual based models grimm et al 2006 2010 2 2 1 purpose the model aims to evaluate the quality of different agricultural land use patterns for the european brown hare lepus europaeus in two representative landscapes the effectiveness of different mitigation measures in bioenergy driven landscapes is explored these measures include alternative energy crops and other measures to increase habitat diversity 2 2 2 entities state variables and scales the model includes two types of entities square grid cells and individuals hares table 1 gives an overview of these entities and their state variables hares are characterised by the following key variables and parameters identity number owner location coordinates x and y at the centre of the grid cell they are on age status juvenile female male and home range area table 1 table 2 grid cells represent 100 m² and are characterised by their coordinates and the variables assigned to them to avoid edge effects the grid is wrapped to a torus each grid cell is covered by one of 14 crop species determined by the variable crop from which the variables 1 suitability as forage habitat foraging f h 2 suitability as breeding habitat breeding b h and 3 crop richness richness r c are derived the foraging and breeding values range from 0 0 not suitable to 1 0 very well suited and are based on expert knowledge drawn from the literature fig 2 table 3 if we did not find any information about a certain crop we derived the value of a similar crop e g for cereals or assumed a mean value of 0 5 an overview of the literature on the ecology of the brown hare which we have used to assess foraging and breeding preferences is given in the supplementary material suitability as forage habitat f h specifies the suitability of each crop species as a food source suitability as breeding habitat b h indicates the suitability of the crop species for getting offspring the value depends on crop density crop height and management activities crop richness r c indicates the distribution and quantity of crops within the landscape many studies show that habitat diversity in general including crop richness has a clear positive effect on hare populations tapper and barnes 1986 lewandowski and nowakowski 1993 reichlin et al 2006 santilli and galardi 2016 following this we related the crop richness value to the number of crops in three levels table 4 the values were chosen to implement a relationship between overall crop richness in the landscape and habitat suitability they represent the fact that habitat suitability does not only depend on local features within a habitat but also on the features of the surrounding landscape note that in our simulations only three values of r c were possible 0 6 for base landscapes with 10 crop species 0 8 for landscapes with one additional crop for mitigation and 1 0 when all 14 crop species listed in table 5 were present the geometric mean of all three variables f h b h r c results in the habitat suitability value s h for each individual grid cell fig 2 s h f h b h r c 3 the hare home ranges in the model landscapes are distributed in a circular shape around the individuals females and males have the same home range size in the model although it can be different in reality because the model proceeds in annual steps juveniles do not have their own home range in the year of birth in the following year they are considered sexually mature and are looking for their own home range the home ranges of several individuals can overlap however a grid cell can only be assigned to the home range of a maximum of 10 hares fig 3 for each additional hare that marks a cell belonging to its home range the habitat suitability value of the cell is reduced by 0 02 both parameters homerangeoverlap and suitabilityreduction as well as other unknown parameters table 2 were estimated by calibrating the model with the hare counts in the reference landscape in the uckermark of 5 individuals per 100 ha data provided by the biomove research training group dfg grk 2118 1 they indirectly simulate competition for habitat and avoid unnatural clumping of too many individuals per area in small scale heterogeneous landscapes home ranges are smaller than those in landscapes with large monocultures following ullmann et al 2018 we set the hare home ranges in the brandenburg scenarios to 55 ha another landscape in south germany bavaria investigated by ullmann et al 2018 with an average field size of 3 ha showed an average hare home range of 19 ha based on these data we interpolated the presumed average value of germany to be 25 ha this value is comparable to the values of 21 ha in rühe and hohmann 2004 and 29 ha in broekhuizen and maaskamp 1981a 1981b a home range of 25 ha corresponds to a radius of 28 grid cells 280 m in the model germany i e a home range of 55 ha to 42 grid cells 420 m in uckermark a time step in the model represents one year and simulations are usually run for 80 time steps 2 2 3 process overview and scheduling in each time step tick the following submodels are called in the specified order the names of the corresponding submodels are printed in italics and are used both in the submodels section and in the program used a flowchart of the model process is depicted in fig 4 first all hares become one year older and juveniles become young adults aging new adults then try to establish a home range establish home range they have three attempts to find a grid cell where they can establish a home range with a suitability about the suitabilitythreshold if they fail they die adults that reached their maximum age die die of longevity in the next step the crop species are reassigned to all fields each year cultivation the selection of the crop species per field depends on the field size and the determined crop proportions for each scenario i e no specific crop rotations are taken into account however the proportion of a crop species in the entire landscape remains the same throughout each simulation run for each scenario next the landscape is evaluated from the perspective of the hare evaluation depending on the crop species the variables foraging breeding and richness are calculated for each grid cell calculate suitability the mean value of all habitat suitability values s h within the home range describes the general suitability of the home range as a habitat calculate suithomerange in the next step all hares search within their home range for a suitable position search homerange to do this the individuals search for suitable patches as start patches within the home range the search radius is limited to the home range because hares are a sedentary species and studies show that they do not significantly expand their home range if their energy requirements are not covered smith et al 2005a 2005b bray et al 2007 the search patches must have a suitability above the thresholdsuitability which indicates the probability of survival and be occupied by 7 individuals maximum if these requirements are met the individual moves to the selected patch and installs its home range then the suitability of the entire home range is calculated if the hare fails three times in finding a new home range it dies failure occurs either through too low habitat quality or too many other individuals within the search radius next all females have 12 15 offspring marboutin et al 2003 reproduction finally mortality rates are applied for juveniles and adults survival mortality rates reflect the loss due to predation environmental impacts e g weather conditions and accidents and are similar to the investigations of marboutin and peroux 1995 each simulation run ends after 80 years or when the population becomes extinct the individuals and grid cells are processed in a random order each time step to avoid priority effects 2 2 4 design concepts 2 2 4 1 basic principles a basic principle of the model is to assign home ranges according to the quality of the habitat e g carter et al 2015 in contrast to home range models that are based on tracking data e g nabe nielsen et al 2014 although in a simplified way by assuming fixed home range sizes the evaluation of habitat quality takes place within these fixed home ranges 2 2 4 2 emergence hare behaviour is largely imposed in terms of both home range establishment and selection and demographic rates 2 2 4 3 adaptation the hares have to adapt to changing habitat conditions due to a yearly changing crop pattern their home ranges are related to the habitat suitability of the arable crops if they are young adults or their habitat quality is not sufficient they must disperse to find a more suitable habitat therewith the hares respond to changes in landscape structure and overall hare abundance in an adaptive way 2 2 4 4 sensing the hares receive information about the habitat suitability of all cells of their home range furthermore they know their status juvenile female or male and age and are affected by the overall crop richness within the model landscape 2 2 4 5 interaction an individual can occupy a new home range only if the total number of individuals on each cell of the respective area is less than 10 this means that the hares compete indirectly for available land juvenile hares trying to establish a home range only select grid cells as staring points which are covered by less than 7 hare home ranges 2 2 4 6 stochasticity the configuration and composition of the landscapes is partly random 1 the agricultural fields are randomly distributed in the landscape by the landscape generator and 2 randomly assigned with crop species according to predefined percentages 3 the hares are processed in a random order each time step to avoid priority effects 4 the offspring are 50 female or male 5 during dispersal the target patch is randomly selected within the search radius 6 females obtain a random number between 12 and 15 offspring 7 hare age is random between 1 and 13 in the first time step all these elements of stochasticity are included to represent natural variation without going into the details of underlying mechanisms 2 2 4 7 observation the main output value is the average number of females and males for the last 50 years after the end of the simulation the first 30 years are discarded to avoid transient effects 2 2 5 initialization to initialize the model a landscape derived from a landscape generator written in c using embacadero rad studio 12 0 available upon request is imported as a text file the file must contain numerical values in a space separated table matching the dimensions of the model landscape from the graphical user interface gui the file input workflow is similar to the method presented in chapter 5 in railsback and grimm 2012 crop species are then distributed to the fields according to the chosen scenario from each crop species or rather the whole number of crops the variables 1 suitability as forage habitat 2 suitability as breeding habitat and 3 crop richness are derived the habitat suitability is calculated for each grid cell and the cells are coloured on a green range with the darkest hue marking the best suitability select habitat suitability view next a number of hares are distributed in the landscape according to the variable initialpopulation the default value is 80 hares corresponding to the data of the real landscape in brandenburg germany age is assigned randomly between 1 and 13 and gender is either female or male with the same probability after the first placement the hares search for a suitable position with sufficient habitat suitability within their home range and claim it if there is no position available the hare is removed from the grid 2 2 6 input data the model does not use any input data that would represent external factors that vary in time 2 2 7 submodels 2 2 7 1 ageing because the model follows an annual rhythm all individuals get one year older in each time step juveniles become young adults and search within a radius of 150 grid cells for their own home range establish home range if they do not succeed at three they die when individuals grow 13 years old they die die of longevity 2 2 7 2 cultivation each cell is assigned a new crop species fourteen different crop species are available for selection alfalfa barley beets grassland grass clover ley maize miscanthus oilseed rape pasture rye set aside mixed silphie triticale and wheat the proportion of a certain crop species in the landscape is defined by a cultivation probability with the selection of the crop species per field remaining the same throughout each simulation run for each mitigation scenario thus as in reality crops are assigned to the fields each year and an evaluation for the hare population takes place table 5 shows the cultivation probabilities of all crop species for each scenario 2 2 7 3 evaluation first the variables 1 suitability as forage habitat foraging f h 2 suitability as breeding habitat breeding b h and 3 crop richness richness r c are derived from each crop species or rather the whole number of crops table 3 and table 4 give an overview of the assessment criteria the geometric mean of all three variables f h b h r c results in the habitat suitability value s h for each individual grid cell s h f h b h r c 3 based on this value the mean habitat suitability of each hare home range is calculated in the next step the habitat suitability value of the home range is compared to the habitat suitability threshold of 0 5 which indicates the probability of survival 2 2 7 4 dispersal after crop cultivation each year all adult hares search within their home range for a suitable new position from where to establish a new home range therefore the individual selects a suitable cell in the home range habitat suitability 0 5 number of owners 7 and moves there then it calculates the mean habitat suitability for the prospective home range if it is sufficient the hare stays there and establishes its home range as a consequence habitat suitability is increased by 0 2 in all grid cells of the original home range and decreased by 0 2 in all cells of the new home range if the conditions do not apply the hare searches for a new target cell and tries to find a suitable home range in the same way if that does not work either it succeeds in the third try or dies juveniles that mature are searching for a home range within a radius of 150 cells 1 5 km prior to the assignment of new crop species their search radius is larger than that of the adults in order to find suitable grid cells outside the mother s home range the other rules applied here are similar to those for adults they search for a suitable grid cell defined by suitability and the requirement that no more than nine hares use this cell as part of their home range then if the suitability of the entire home range is such as with the adults too low they try again but die after the third unsuccessful attempt thus the number of adults alive before reproduction takes place is determined by habitat suitability which in turn depends on crop species field configurations and the density of conspecifics these factors affect hare distribution and abundance two times per year for establishing young adults and after new assignments of crops for established adults 2 2 7 5 reproduction every year sexually mature females get 12 15 offspring marboutin et al 2003 the number of offspring is selected at random 2 2 7 6 survival the individuals die after a maximum of 13 years of life they die earlier if the habitat suitability is not sufficient to feed them and they cannot find a new position offspring in the first year die when the mother dies in addition there is a fixed mortality rate to reflect predation environmental impacts e g weather conditions and accidents the mortality rate for juveniles is 20 higher than for adults marboutin and peroux 1995 2 3 scenarios the basis for our simulations are two recent crop distributions one of the reference landscapes in brandenburg um uckermark germany and one average distribution for germany in 2017 ger germany the crop data for uckermark gis invekos 2015 were provided by the leibniz centre for agricultural landscape research zalf because the proportions of the rarely cultivated crops 1 were too small to be consistent in the model landscape we selected the ten most common crops in total 97 cultivated in this landscape for the base scenario um the data for the german average scenario are derived from the federal statistical office germany destatis 2018 to compare both landscapes we also selected the ten most common crops for the base scenario ger in both landscapes the proportions of the ten most common crops were recalculated for the entire area table 5 however because the fields cannot be filled to the exact percentage there are minor deviations from the set values maize and winter oilseed rape are the most frequently cultivated energy crops in uckermark as well as in germany a total of 14 5 of maize is cultivated in the reference landscape in brandenburg most of it is silage maize for feed production 97 and 3 is used for biogas production however there is a high proportion of winter oilseed rape 18 1 mainly used for biofuel production the german average maize cultivation in 2017 was 15 8 of agricultural land but locally the proportion can be much higher approximately 5 of this is cultivated land is used for biogas production in contrast the german average of oilseed rape cultivation 7 4 of agricultural land is much lower than the percentage in the reference landscape in brandenburg to mitigate the negative effects of a high proportion of maize and oilseed rape on the brown hare we investigated various mitigation measures three of these measures focus on the effects of alternative energy plants mixed silphie ae1 miscanthus ae2 and grass clover ley ae3 and three on the effects of more beneficial crop compositions alfalfa cc1 set aside cc2 and crop richness cc3 we selected mixed silphie miscanthus and grass clover ley as alternative energy crops because they are considered to be more environmentally friendly than annual energy crops semere and slater 2007 dauber and miyake 2016 schorpp and schrader 2016 the asteraceae silphie silphium perfoliatum is bee friendly and can remain in the field for up to ten years under good conditions mixed silphie has a similar yield to that of maize and is therefore a realistic alternative for biogas production gansberger et al 2015 the reed grass miscanthus miscanthus x giganteus sometimes called elephant grass has a harvest period of over twenty years with its high biomass yield it is also a remarkable alternative for biofuel production kocar and civas 2013 by 2018 both mixed silphie and miscanthus are eligible for use on greening areas as a result of the mid term review of the common agricultural policy cap it can therefore be assumed that the proportion of both energy crops will continue to increase in the coming years for example the silphie cultivation has more than doubled to over 3000 ha in 2017 over than value in 2016 destatis 2018 grass clover ley is a mix of legumes and grasses which allows multiple harvesting with a high yield level of biomass it is used as livestock feed as well as for energy production in biogas plants stinner et al 2008 alfalfa medicago sativa is a forage legume for hares and it becomes important in the spring summer when the digestibility of cereals is reduced due to maturation or harvest that has taken place santilli et al 2014 set aside is considered a particularly high quality ecological measure which on the one hand creates valuable areas of protection and on the other hand opens up many possibilities for the cross linking of biotopes it has been identified in many studies as a favourable habitat for many animal species on the agricultural landscape and for the brown hare as it often has a high diversity of plants and is structurally heterogeneous reichlin et al 2006 gevers et al 2011 meichtry stier et al 2014 langhammer et al 2017 for the first five scenarios we increased the proportion of the respective crop or set aside to 10 each and reduced the proportion of maize mixed silphie and grass clover ley scenario and oilseed rape miscanthus alfalfa and set aside scenario accordingly the percentage of each crop in each scenario is shown in table 5 for the crop richness scenario cc3 we integrated all 14 crops into the landscape with a proportion of at least 5 each as a result we compared the six strategies regarding their mitigating effects to provide management recommendations for the protection of the brown hare 2 3 1 sensitivity analysis we conducted sensitivity experiments and spot checks data not shown i e varied key parameters over their full range and performed specific tests for single parameters while keeping all other parameters constant to understand how the variation affects model predictions during calibration it turned out that some parameters the radius of the home range homerangeradius the threshold for habitat suitability thresholdsuitability and the home range overlap homerangeoverlap were most sensitive to test the sensitivity we varied the values of the two parameters in the base scenario uckermark and the base scenario germany and calculated the resulting hare population abundance the thresholdsuitability parameter was varied from 0 to 1 in 0 1 interval steps the parameter homerangeradius varied from 10 to 50 grid cells in steps of five to test the influence of hare home range overlap we varied the number of possible overlaps from 0 to 20 hares in steps of two furthermore we performed sensitivity analysis by reducing the weighting of the crop richness criterion instead of weighting one third compared to forage and breeding suitability we tested one quarter one sixth and zero the sensitivity analyses were based on 100 replicates with the same input parameters as that of field size and number of crops 2 4 data analysis we ran each scenario for a total of 80 years however the population abundance was determined after only 30 years because the population had to stabilise in the first years thereafter the number of adults females and males was recorded annually from each scenario 100 replicates were run each replicate differed in the initial distribution of hares and crops in the landscape the total number of simulations was 1600 boxplots show the effects of the mitigation measures on the hare abundance for each landscape to compare and rank the effects of different mitigation measures we calculated the relative change of hare densities compared to the base scenario mann whitney u tests were performed for each scenario to test the significance of the changes all statistical calculations were carried out with r 3 4 3 r core team 2017 3 results due to model calibration the hare abundance in the base scenario uckermark 3 9 individuals per 100 ha is comparable to the hare counts in the reference landscape of 5 individuals per 100 ha data provided by the biomove research training group dfg grk 2118 1 in germany the mean abundance in the base scenario is approximately twice as high as that in uckermark 8 2 individuals per 100 ha comparisons with average data for germany are difficult because hare densities can differ greatly between regions strauss et al 2008 showed average population densities between 5 4 individuals per 100 ha in east germany and 23 9 individuals per 100 ha in northwest germany the average german hare density in 2016 was 12 individuals per 100 ha greiser et al 2018 all mitigation measures had significant effects p 0 001 on the hare population abundance table 6 fig 5 however the relative effect of the mitigation measures was slightly smaller in uckermark max 0 41 than in germany max 0 56 in general the mean standard deviation of all scenarios was slightly higher in germany 0 5 individuals per 100 ha than in uckermark 0 4 individuals per 100 ha 3 1 impact of alternative energy crops the relative effect of the alternative energy crops was significantly different in both landscapes fig 6 in uckermark the increase of the energy crops of mixed silphie and grass clover ley influenced the hare abundance most positively each 0 41 in comparison the energy crop of miscanthus had a minor positive effect 0 14 additionally in germany the increase of mixed silphie and grass clover ley had the largest positive effect on hare abundance 0 56 in contrast to uckermark miscanthus had a negative effect in germany 0 16 3 2 impact of modified crop compositions the relative effects of the other crop composition modifications were again smaller in uckermark max 0 26 than in germany max 0 53 fig 6 the most positive effect in both landscapes included the crop richness scenario but that in uckermark was only approximately half as that in germany 0 26 in uckermark 0 53 in germany alfalfa had a minor positive effect in both landscapes 0 08 in uckermark 0 12 in germany while the increase in set asides had a moderate effect of 0 19 in uckermark and 0 26 in germany overall the mitigation measures of mixed silphie grass clover ley and increased crop richness led to distinct increases in hare abundances in both landscapes 0 3 3 3 sensitivity analyses fig a1 in the appendix shows that a reduction of the hare home range radius in the model correlates with an increase in population abundance a small home range of 3 1 ha corresponding to a radius of 10 grid cells in the model leads to a hare density of 56 8 individuals per 100 ha in uckermark and 63 3 individuals per 100 ha in germany in turn a large home range of 78 5 ha corresponding to a radius of 50 grid cells in the model leads to low hare densities of 2 7 individuals per 100 ha in uckermark and 2 3 individuals per 100 ha in germany the threshold for habitat suitability strongly influences hare population development at a threshold higher than 0 4 the population abundances decrease rapidly until it dies out at a threshold of 0 7 in both landscapes fig a2 below a threshold of 0 5 the hare population stabilises at a density of 6 5 individuals per 100 ha in uckermark and 15 4 individuals per 100 ha in germany furthermore there is a strong correlation between the number of potential home range overlaps per grid cell in the model and the hare abundance a huge maximal overlap of 20 hare home ranges per grid cell leads to a population density of 4 4 individuals per 100 ha in uckermark and 8 9 individuals per 100 ha in germany fig a3 on the other hand when no overlap was allowed it led to a population density of 0 0 individuals per 100 ha in uckermark and 0 6 individuals per 100 ha in germany a reduction in the weighting of the crop richness criterion from less than 25 led to a strong decrease in the hare population abundances in both landscapes fig a4 it was weighted with one third in comparison to the forage and breeding suitability of a crop in the default settings of the model a reduction to zero led to the extinction of the hare populations in both landscapes 4 discussion we used an individual based model to investigate the influence of mitigation measures in agricultural landscapes on the brown hare the results show that it is possible to predict population development under modified habitat conditions using the model the examined scenarios resulted in different responses of the hare population from minor to large responses it turned out that not only the composition of the landscape the number and proportion of crops but also the configuration the field sizes play an important role in hare population development the model landscapes used in this study vary in field size and the proportion and distribution of crops in the german average landscape where the field sizes are significantly smaller than those in the uckermark mitigation measures had a stronger impact this result was mainly caused by the smaller hare home ranges in germany which allowed an overall higher population abundance on the landscape because the habitat requirements of hares are met more easily in small scale heterogeneous landscapes hares do not have to move long distances as in landscapes with large monocultures broekhuizen and maaskamp 1981a 1981b tapper and barnes 1986 rühe and hohmann 2004 smith et al 2004 bertolino et al 2013 within smaller home ranges hares benefit more quickly from mitigation measures as the probability of favourable crop species in their home range is higher thus smaller field sizes can be regarded as mitigation strategies by themselves in contrast the probability of favourable crop species decreases in landscapes with large fields the model results show that not only the configuration of the landscape affects hare population development but also the composition i e the number and distribution of the crop species bennett et al 2006 found that spatial configuration had less influence on biota than did the composition of a landscape in comparison fahrig et al 2011 recommend the consideration of a functional landscape heterogeneity in which compositional heterogeneity and configurational heterogeneity were examined separately and were species related to evaluate the crop species for the brown hare in the model we based our assessment on the literature unfortunately there were few concrete data available thus we mostly had to translate qualitative assessments into foraging and breeding values in the following we discuss the model results with regard to their consistency in relation to the literature references in uckermark the proportion of wheat which is a favourable crop for hares is much higher 37 5 than that in germany 20 7 winter wheat in the form of seedlings is especially important in spring pepin and angibault 2007 bertolino et al 2011 although the proportion of maize and rape in uckermark is comparably high 33 7 the negative effects are compensated by wheat therefore the addition of 10 hare friendly crops had a lower overall effect than that in germany in total the mitigation measures had a more moderate effect in uckermark and a stronger effect in germany this result indicates that the general composition of the landscape must be considered when mitigation measures are planned the mitigating effect depends not only on one crop replacement but also on the proportion and distribution of other crops in the landscape energy crop cultivation can be diversified with alternative energy crops the alternative energy scenarios show that mixed silphie and grass clover ley have a strong positive effect on hare population development while miscanthus has a little to a negative effect which is dependent on the landscape mixed silphie offers coverage for hares from the beginning of april if the stands are harvested by mid september the rootstock will form new rosette leaves until snow falls these scenarios offer good cover in autumn e g protection from wind rain and predators a perennial grass clover ley offers a high level of cover and forage availability to hares santilli 2006 and is more attractive than pastures frylestam 1986 clover as a forage legume becomes especially important in spring and summer when cereals start to ripen and their digestibility is reduced santilli et al 2014 or after they are harvested reichlin et al 2006 the bioenergy crop miscanthus even the young sprouts are entirely avoided as food petrovan et al 2017 the second part of crop composition measures also showed different effects i e from low to high the addition of the legume alfalfa had a minor effect in both landscapes although alfalfa is a forage plant for hares harvesting takes place several times a year leading to high leveret losses represented in the model by low breeding habitat suitability increasing set asides had a moderate positive effect in both landscapes set asides with low to medium height and favourable plant composition are a very important foraging habitat for hares reichlin et al 2006 gevers et al 2011 meichtry stier et al 2014 langhammer et al 2017 these landscapes offer a high amount and variety of wild herbs and grasses which are an essential part of the hare diet however if the vegetation becomes too high and dense hares avoid these areas schai braun et al 2013 the strongest positive effect of the crop composition measures in both landscapes was the increase in crop richness from 10 to 14 crops with at least a 5 proportion for each crop many studies demonstrate that brown hare populations are strongly positively influenced by habitat diversity variety of crops as they need protection and forage plants year round e g tapper and barnes 1986 lewandowski and nowakowski 1993 vaughan et al 2003 santilli and galardi 2016 our results show that an increase in crop richness in the landscape has a beneficial effect on hares as they have more opportunities to find year round forage and cover one way to achieve this benefit is to cultivate alternative energy crops that are beneficial for hares the extent to which the proportion of mitigation measures in a real landscape should be increased to stabilise the population in the long term would have to be investigated more precisely in further studies oppermann et al 2012 suggest 10 and meichtry stier et al 2014 at least 14 of areas should be covered by high quality agri environmental measures or semi natural habitats to sustainably protect agricultural biodiversity using the individual based hare model controlled simulation experiments can be performed and useful predictions can be made the results show that it is possible to achieve reliable results with the model even without a profound data background nevertheless the model is based on many simplifying assumptions which are often a compromise between resolution and data availability for example the landscapes are quite artificial and contain no landscape structures other than agricultural fields although hares are mainly found in fields 70 they also use other habitats such as meadows woodlands shrubby habitats and spontaneous vegetation 27 5 reichlin et al 2006 bertolino et al 2011 additionally field margins are a favourite foraging and breeding habitat due to the often higher diversity and height of growth in principle it is possible to represent landscape structure and dynamics with higher resolution e g by using a complex simulation system for hares and other animal species almass topping et al 2003 which simulates population development based on real landscapes at a spatial resolution up to 1 m² one advantage of almass is that even narrow landscape structures such as field margins can be mapped and the high temporal resolution of one day enables the precise representation of animal and management activities however due to the complexity the model is rather difficult to modify parameterize and analyse the implementation of mitigation measures in the model also represents a simplification in reality eligible greening measures are not implemented equally because farmers can choose among several options for example ecologically valuable edge structures such as field edges and buffer strips are implemented much less frequently than is the cultivation of eligible crops such as nitrogen fixing crops pe er et al 2017 in the model a time step represents one year even if the spring summer conditions are assumed because this is the period in which most breeding takes place tapper 1987 flux and angermann 1990 in reality crops are mainly used on a seasonal basis so that general statements regarding a crop species can be made only to a limited extent wheat is especially important in spring maize in spring and summer and stubble in autumn bertolino et al 2011 and reichlin et al 2006 show that in may more than 75 of the food supply consists of cereals in summer when the cereals have been harvested hares shift to other crops such as fabaceae grasses and herbs however the seasonal characteristics of crops are indirectly included in the model in the form of forage and breeding estimates to assess the suitability of crops as breeding habitats we considered conditions such as crop height and management activities in spring and summer we could not parameterize the weighting of the three criteria for forage breeding and crop richness because there are no data available for them however the sensitivity analysis shows that a reduction in the weighting of the crop richness criterion had a strong effect on hare population abundance this result underlines the importance of crop richness for population development however our assumptions on how crop richness in the entire model landscape affects local habitat suitability were largely imposed but do not affect the comparative assessment of different 10 or 11 crop species scenarios currently there seem to be no data available which would allow to replace these assumptions with more realistic and emergent ones other important population influencing factors are indirectly included as mortality rates in the model such as predation weather conditions and diseases the hare home ranges in the model do not emerge dynamically but are fixed with a certain radius it follows that despite relative adaptations to spatial conditions and seasons hares are a sedentary species and studies show that they do not significantly expand their home range if their energy requirements are not covered smith et al 2005a 2005b bray et al 2007 thus the hares in the model search only within their home ranges for a new more suitable place from which the new home range is created the number of attempts is a compromise between the probability of success to find a new place and the computing time it takes to perform this process for all hares and grid cells there are other models that use fixed home ranges for species e g for birds in scherer et al 2016 and everaars et al 2014 nevertheless there is a natural variation in home range size which depends on the landscape structure and food supply broekhuizen and maaskamp 1981a 1981b tapper and barnes 1986 rühe and hohmann 2004 smith et al 2004 bertolino et al 2013 following this the home ranges in uckermark are much larger than those in germany the overlap of home ranges of individual hares fluctuates strongly in reality in densely populated areas there is a strong overlap rühe and hohmann 2004 in the model the maximum overlap of ten home ranges was assumed to match the real population densities in the uckermark this indirectly controls the intraspecific competition which of course also affects the results population growth can only take place within the framework of this rule and is therefore limited nevertheless we assume that direct intraspecific competition in nature is also subject to similar though much more complex limiting factors estimates of the effects of mitigation measures on population development are usually related to agri environment schemes e g kleijn and sutherland 2003 donald and evans 2006 kleijn et al 2006 or other taxa such as plants birds or insects e g pryke and samways 2015 hille et al 2018 with regard to agri environmental measures there are few studies analysing the effects on brown hare populations zellweger fischer et al 2011 petrovan et al 2013 meichtry stier et al 2014 as cap reform s greening measures are a comparatively young policy instrument introduced by the 2013 cap reform reliable evaluations are rare a survey among 88 ecologists from 17 european countries in pe er et al 2017 resulted in recommendations for improved ecological effectiveness of greening measures gocht et al 2017 estimate the environmental impacts of biodiversity friendly farming practices in the context of cap greening as small although some regions are more positively affected than others regarding the brown hare one modelling approach exists that evaluates the effectiveness of ecological focus areas in danish landscapes langhammer et al 2017 the study found that a 5 coverage of an ecological focus area is insufficient to improve the living conditions of the brown hare to a substantial degree permanent set aside was identified as the most favourable ecological focus area with a relative increase in female abundance by a factor of 3 6 altogether more studies on the regional implementation and impact of greening measures are needed to make reliable assessments for the brown hare although the model presented here can be used to quickly assess rough trends of policy measures it does not replace the long term monitoring of hares 5 conclusion the hare model presented here opens up new possibilities to answer environmental questions in due time the impact of mitigation and policy measures on hare population development can be estimated on the basis of simplified generated landscapes furthermore the use of a landscape generator in combination with a species model allows the investigation of numerous landscape compositions and configurations the results show that both have a significant effect on the hare population whereby they respond particularly strongly to compositional changes the cultivation of alternative energy crops e g mixed silphie and grass clover ley allows the increase of diversity in the landscape which has proven to be highly beneficial for the brown hare the reduction of field sizes is also a strategy to positively affect hare population development as it increases local heterogeneity the future lies in agricultural landscape generators able to reproduce landscapes in even more detail to make more realistic predictions langhammer et al 2019 based on such tools and appropriate data sets assessment schemes that cover a range of landscapes management practices and species can be developed this purpose requires both the further development parameterization and testing of such spatial models and the collection of data and long term monitoring of species together both enable targeted analyses and predictions for the protection of biodiversity in agricultural landscapes declaration of

24939,the study of eco evolutionary dynamics is based on the idea that ecological and evolutionary processes may operate on the same or very similar time scales and that interactions of ecological and evolutionary processes may have important consequences here we develop a model that combines mendelian population genetics with nonlinear demography to create a truly eco evolutionary model we use the vec permutation matrix approach classifying individuals by stage and genotype the demographic component is female dominant and density dependent the genetic component includes random mating by stage and genotype and arbitrary effects of genotype on the demographic phenotype mutation is neglected the result is a nonlinear matrix population model that projects the stage genotype distribution we show that the results can include bifurcations of population dynamics driven by the response to selection we present analytical criteria that determine whether one allele excludes the other or if they persist in a protected polymorphism the results are based on local stability analysis of the homozygous boundary equilibria as an example we use a density dependent stage classified model of the flour beetle tribolium castaneum our model permits arbitrary life cycle complexity and nonlinearity tribolium has developed resistance to the pesticide malathion due to a dominant allele at a single autosomal locus using parameters reported from laboratory experiments we show that the model successfully describes the dynamics of both resistant and susceptible homozygotes and the outcome of a selection experiment containing both alleles stability analysis of the boundary equilibria confirms that the resistant allele excludes the susceptible allele even in the absence of malathion agreeing with previously reported results keywords eco evolutionary dynamics evolutionary demography density dependent selection protected polymorphism pesticide resistance stability analysis 1 introduction the demographic processes of birth and death drive changes in gene frequencies and changes in population density and structure demography is therefore central to understanding ecology and evolution and eco evolutionary analyses always strive to incorporate the fundamental demographic processes of birth death and development e g coulson et al 2006 metcalf and pavard 2007 de vries and caswell 2019b recently introduced an eco evolutionary framework that combines matrix population models with basic mendelian genetics here we use this framework to explore density dependent selection density dependence occurs when the per capita vital rates rates of birth mortality and development depend on population size or density density dependence may be negative or positive allee effects in models that contain demographic structure density is a multivariate concept vital rates may depend on the abundance of a particular stage or age class or on a weighted density that gives distinct weights to different stages rather than the total population density caswell et al 2004 for example density dependent effects due to difficulty in finding mates leads to fertilities that depend on the abundances or densities of reproducing stages cannabilism is usually restricted to large individuals eating smaller conspecifics so density dependent effects due to cannibalism are size or stage specific we will assume that genotypes can differ in age or stage specific rates of development survival or fertility anywhere in the life cycle thus we assume that pleiotropic effects are the rule rather than the exception early theoretical work on density dependent selection macarthur 1962 roughgarden 1971 combined population genetics with unstructured ecological models by writing genotype fitnesses as a function of genotypic densities macarthur and wilson 1967 and roughgarden 1971 extended the logistic equation to multiple competing genotypes and showed that selection leads to an increase in population density in a constant environment because only alleles with heterozygote advantage in the carrying capacity can invade this result leads to the ideas of r and k selection charlesworth 1971 extended this to any fitness function that decreases with population densities charlesworth 1994 used high order difference equations to model density dependent selection in age structured populations in this paper we will incorporate age or stage structure by using matrix population models rather than scalar difference equations in this paper we show how to construct a density dependent mendelian matrix population model based on genotype specific demographic measurements we show how to use that model to project the stage genotype distribution and derive analytical conditions that determine whether alleles will coexist in a genetic polymorphism or if one or another allele will go to fixation we apply the analysis to a study of pesticide resistance in tribolium beetles a species that is a pest of stored grain products we investigate the effect of incomplete dominance on the speed of invasion and on the outcome of invasion using evolutionary stability analysis 2 model construction individuals are jointly classified by stage 1 ω and by genotype 1 g each genotype is characterized by a survival and transition matrix and a matrix of fertility rates both the transition matrices and the fertility matrices are assumed to be density dependent in this section we will consider general density dependence without specifying a functional dependence in section 3 we apply the general results obtained to a specific model with density dependent demographic rates we make the important assumption of female demographic dominance i e we assume that enough males are always present to fertilize all the females and that the number of offspring produced in a mating is not affected by the stage or genotype i e the i state of the male this assumption can be relaxed by introducing a marriage function but we do not explore that here we also assume that males and females have the same survival and transition rates and that male and female offspring are produced in equal proportions these two assumptions imply that the male and female genotype stage population vectors remain equal provided they start equal de vries and caswell 2019a therefore we can treat the female vector as representative of both the male and the female populations and we can calculate allele frequencies in the breeding population from the female population vector these assumptions make it possible to model sexual reproduction in a one sex model the matrices vectors and mathematical operations used in this paper are listed in table 1 matrices are denoted by bold upper case letters e g u and vectors by bold lower case letters e g n following caswell et al 2018 we use a tilde e g u n to denote block structured matrices and vectors whose entries describe both demographic stage and genotype for a single locus with 2 alleles say a and a we will identify genotypes 1 2 and 3 as aa aa and aa respectively the population state vector is 1 n t n aa t n aa t n aa t where e g n aa contains the numbers or densities of stages 1 s for genotype aa the population vector n is projected from time t to time t 1 by a denisty dependent matrix a n so that 2 n t 1 a n n t 3 u n f n n t where u describes survival and transition rates and f reproduction the population projection matrix a depends on n because of genetics the genotypes of offspring depend on gene frequencies of parents and because of ecological nonlinearities due to density dependence the genetic component of the model depends on the normalized population distribution vector p t defined as 4 p t n t n t where denotes the 1 norm the normalized population distribution vector consists of three genotype specific population vectors 5 p t p aa t p aa t p aa t 2 1 the components of the population projection matrix the population projection matrix is constructed from two sets of matrices describing demographic transitions for each genotype and one set of matrices describing the parent offspring map for each stage u i n demographic transitions for females of genotype i i 1 g ω ω f i n fertility matrix for females of genotype i i 1 g ω ω h j n parent offspring map for stage j j 1 s g g the matrix u i n contains the stage specific density dependent transition and survival rates for females of genotype i the matrix f i n contains stage specific density dependent fertility rates for females of genotype i the matrices h j n map the genotype of a mother in stage j to the genotypes of her offspring the k ℓ entry of h j is the probability that the offspring of a genotype ℓ mother of stage j has genotype k we assume that mating is random with respect to stage and hence that the parent offspring map is the same for all stages i e h j n h n assortative mating by stage would lead to differences among the h j the matrix h n is discussed in section 2 3 the model also formally contains matrices describing the transitions of individuals among genotype classes for each age or stage caswell et al 2018 but since individuals do not change genotypes these are identity matrices 2 2 mating from genotypes of parents to genotypes of offspring non reproductive e g immature stages play no role in mating hence following de vries and caswell 2019b we define the breeding population by an indicator vector c j for j 1 g that shows which stages of genotype j take part in mating the ith entry of c j is 1 if individuals of stage i and genotype j reproduce and 0 otherwise the size of the breeding population is then 6 n b i 1 g e i t c i t n where e i is a vector g 1 with a 1 in position i and zeros elsewhere and indicates the kronecker product breeding stages are allowed to differ among genotypes in order to study the fate of traits that change reproductive schedules in the special case where the genotypes do not differ in their reproductive stages c i c for all genotypes i and 7 n b 1 g t c t n where 1 g t is a vector of ones of dimensions 1 g the genotype frequency vector within the breeding population is 8 p b x n n b where 9 x i 1 g e ii c i t with e ii a matrix of dimension g g with a 1 in the i i location and zeros elsewhere if the breeding vectors are the same for all genotypes c i c then 10 x i g c t the genotype frequency vector for genotype i is trivially p i e i the gene frequencies in an individual of genotype i q i and the gene frequencies in the breeding population q b are functions of the genotype frequencies so that 11 q i w p i 12 q b w p b where for the 2 allele case 13 w 1 0 5 0 0 0 5 1 combining eqs 8 and 12 yields the following expression for the gene frequencies in the breeding population 14 q b q a b q a b w x n n b we set mutation rates to zero see de vries and caswell 2019b for details on how mutation could be included 2 3 the matrix h when a female randomly picks an allele from the gamete pool she will pick allele a with probability q a b and allele a with probability q a b these probabilities therefore determine the distribution of genotypes in her offspring which is captured in the matrix h p 15 h p q a b 1 2 q a b 0 q a b 1 2 q a b 0 1 2 q a b q a b the first column of h p contains the genotype distribution in the offspring of an aa mother she produces an aa offspring with probability q a b and an aa offspring with probability q a b the second and third columns give the genotype distributions for mothers of genotypes aa and aa the matrix h is a homogenous function of degree zero of the population vector n since h α n h n thus we can write it equally as a function of n or p for a step by step derivation of h see de vries and caswell 2019b section 2 3 and appendix a 2 4 the population projection matrix to project the eco evolutionary dynamics the component matrices u i n and f i n must be incorporated into the population projection matrix a n e g caswell et al 2018 to do so create a set of block diagonal matrices u f and ℍ that contain the corresponding demographic matrices on the diagonal i e 16 u i 1 g e i i u i n 17 f i 1 g e i i f i n 18 ℍ i ω h p the fertility matrix f n is constructed from the block matrix containing genotype specific fertility rates and from the parent to offspring genotype map 19 f n k t ℍ p k f n where k is the vec permutation matrix henderson and searle 1981 which changes the arrangement of the vector from stages within genotypes to genotypes within stages from right to left the block diagonal matrix f first produces offspring possibly of different birth stages e g seedlings of different sizes as a function of the genotype of the mother when they appear these offspring are associated with the genotype of the mother the vec permutation matrix k rearranges the vector and then the block diagonal matrix ℍ p allocates the offspring to their genotypes based on the genotype of their mother and the genotype distribution of the rest of the population finally k t returns the vector to its original arrangement this vec permutation approach to constructing matrix population models was introduced by hunter and caswell 2005 and is described in more detail by caswell 2012 caswell and salguero gómez 2013 caswell et al 2018 and caswell 2019 the fertility matrix f n captures the process of mendelian inheritance substituting eqs 15 17 and 18 into eq 19 yields 20 the first block column of f n contains the offspring produced by an aa female the upper left block in the first column q a f aa n gives the production of aa offspring by aa females that randomly pick allele a from the gamete pool which happens with probability q a the next block down q a f aa n contains the production of aa offspring by an aa female picking allele a from the gamete pool similarly the second and third row blocks contain offspring produced by an aa female and an aa female respectively since individuals do not change their genotype once they are born the survival matrix is the block diagonal matrices 21 u n k t i ω g k u u or written in terms of the genotype specific block matrices 22 we project the stage genotype dynamics with u n in eq 22 and f n in eq 20 using eq 3 3 stage genotype dynamics of tribolium flour beetles of the genus tribolium have been used extensively to study population dynamics and population genetics see costantino et al 2005 for a review tribolium is an economically important pest of flour and stored grain products a nonlinear matrix population model for tribolium was developed by cushing and collaborators see for example cushing et al 2002 the tribolium model contains three stages larvae l pupae p and adults d it is nonlinear because in addition to feeding on flour tribolium adults cannibalize eggs and pupae larvae in turn cannibalize eggs these nonlinearities lead to a plethora of interesting bifurcations attractors and transient and asymptotic dynamics which have been studied extensively costantino et al 1995 1997 2005 henson et al 2002 cushing et al 2002 edmunds et al 2003 we use the tribolium model as the basis for a genetic model by including one locus two allele a and a mendelian genetics we define effective adult densities d and d and an effective larval density l as linear combinations of the genotype densities 23 d κ aa d aa κ aa d aa κ aa d aa 24 d ξ aa d aa ξ aa d aa ξ aa d aa 25 l χ aa l aa χ aa l aa χ aa l aa and use these to express the density effects of pupa cannibalism by adults 23 and egg cannibalism by adults 24 and larva 25 each genotype i has a survival and transition matrix 26 u i 0 0 0 1 μ i 0 0 0 e d 1 ν i where μ i and ν i are the larval and adult mortality rates respectively in addition each genotype i has a fertility matrix 27 f i 0 0 β i e l d 0 0 0 0 0 0 where β i is the fecundity at low densities this parameterization permits selection to operate on any of the life history characteristics i e stage specific viability fertility and or cannibalism rates genotype stage dynamics as an example of genotype stage dynamics we use parameters estimated from a laboratory population of tribolium by dennis et al 1995 table 2 we introduce a hypothetical allele with additive effects on fecundity parameter β the simulation was initialized with a population of aa individuals with low fecundity at the stage distribution of the homozygote equilibrium after 50 iterations one larval heterozygote is introduced into the population with a fecundity exactly in between the two homozygotes the invading allele with larger birthrate gradually takes over the population and becomes fixed as the genetic composition of the population changes fig 1 c and d the population structure changes fig 1a and b eventually as the population approaches the aa boundary the dynamics bifurcate from a stable equilibrium to a two point cycle matlab code and parameters used for fig 1 are in the online supplementary materials 4 the outcome of density dependent selection conditions for genotype coexistence the most basic question about selection density dependent or otherwise is the question of whether genotypes coexist so that the population retains some degree of genetic diversity or whether one allele becomes fixed the question becomes more complicated but no less basic when demographic structure and nonlinearity are included in this section we present a general condition for determining the outcome of selection the dynamics of n take place in an ωg dimensional space defined by combinations of ω stages and g genotypes with g 3 in the present context in the absence of mutation the ω dimensional boundary subspaces corresponding to the homozygous genotypes aa and aa are invariant under the dynamics specified by a n these dynamics are given by the nonlinear projection matrices for the homozygous genotypes fig 2 we assume the existence of a single equilibrium on each boundary and that this equilibrium is stable with respect to perturbations in the boundary subspace coexistence of the two alleles in a protected polymorphism levene 1953 prout 1968 see nagylaki 1992 chap 6 results when the boundary subspaces are both unstable to perturbations into the interior that is if allele a can invade a population of aa individuals and allele a can invade a population of aa individuals then a homozygote state can never be reached again once both alleles are present in the population since both alleles grow when rare mutual invasibility therefore leads to a protected genetic polymorphism in general the dynamics in the interior are unknown and could include multiple equilibria strange attractors cycles etc provided both boundary subspaces are unstable to perturbations into the interior we refer to any of the possibly exotic dynamics in the interior as a protected polymorphism in general nonlinear models could possess multiple invariant sets equilibria cycles strange attractors on the boundary we restrict our discussion to models with a unique equilibrium on the boundary extending the analysis to include a k cycle on the boundary would be accomplished by transforming the k point cycle into an equilibrium of the k fold map but we do not consider this here 4 1 stability of the homozygote boundaries the stability of a boundary equilibrium is determined by the spectral radius i e the magnitude of the eigenvalue with the largest magnitude of the jacobian matrix at the equilibrium we denote this eigenvalue by ζ aa and ζ aa for the aa and aa boundaries respectively if ζ 1 the equilibrium is stable if ζ 1 it is unstable we assume that the boundary equilibria are locally stable to perturbations within the boundary subspace so if the equilibrium is unstable the associated eigenvector must point into the interior which implies that the invading allele increases when rare the jacobian matrix 28 m d n t 1 d n t t n ˆ is obtained by differentiating eq 3 and evaluating the resulting derivative at the boundary equilibrium here we give the jacobian at the aa boundary the expression at the aa boundary can be derived afterwards by symmetry the jacobian matrix at the aa boundary is 29 m a n ˆ e 1 n ˆ aa t i ω vec u aa n t n ˆ e 1 n ˆ aa t i ω vec f aa n t n ˆ ecological nonlinearity e 1 i ω f aa n ˆ aa q a n t n ˆ e 2 i ω f aa n ˆ aa q a n t n ˆ genetic nonlinearity see appendix a for a derivation the linearization reflects the two sources of nonlinearity in the model those due to ecological density dependence and those due to the genetic frequency dependence the matrix m is a block structured matrix with blocks corresponding to genotypes and entries within the blocks corresponding to stages within genotypes 30 the block m 11 represents the contribution of perturbations in the aa direction to growth or decline of perturbations in the aa direction block m 12 represents the contribution of perturbations in the aa direction to growth or decline of perturbations in the aa direction etc all of the blocks in the jacobian are given with their derivation in appendix a evaluated at the equilibrium on the aa boundary the jacobian matrix m is block upper triangular with 31 m 21 m 31 m 32 0 see eq a 35 in appendix a thus the spectral radius of m depends on the eigenvalues of the diagonal blocks block m 33 u aa projects perturbations in the aa direction and since ρ u aa 1 this direction is always stable the block m 11 projects perturbations within the aa boundary by assumption the boundary equilibrium is stable to such perturbations so the spectral radius of m 11 must be less than one the stability of the aa boundary equilibrium therefore depends on the spectral radius of the submatrix m 22 32 m 22 u aa n ˆ 1 2 f aa n ˆ 1 2 n b f aa n ˆ aa c aa t where n b is the number of individuals that are in a breeding stage at the equilibrium see appendix a because m 22 is non negative its largest eigenvalue is real and corresponds to the spectral radius we denote the maximum eigenvalue of m 22 as 33 ζ aa ρ m 22 where ρ denotes the spectral radius of the matrix by symmetry the dominant eigenvalue of the jacobian matrix at the aa boundary denoted by ζ aa is obtained by replacing aa by aa in 32 criteria for a polymorphism a protected polymorphism occurs when both boundaries are unstable i e when 34 ζ aa 1 and ζ aa 1 the inequalities in eq 34 are satisfied if and only if 35 ρ u aa n ˆ 1 2 f aa n ˆ 1 2 n b f aa n ˆ aa c aa t 1 36 ρ u aa n ˆ 1 2 f aa n ˆ 1 2 n b f aa n ˆ aa c aa t 1 we note that the conditions for polymorphism in eqs 35 and 36 are a function of the nonlinear demographic rates of both the invading heterozygote and the resident homozygote through the matrices u i and f i and of the structure of the homozygote equilibrium n ˆ aa or n ˆ aa 5 tribolium revisited density dependent selection and pesticide resistance armed with these coexistence conditions we return to tribolium to study the spread of malathion resistance in the red flour beetle tribolium castaneum malathion was a commonly used pesticide in grain storage in the 1950s and malathion resistance has since become widespread in tribolium castaneum the evolution of pesticide resistance is usually assumed to involve a fitness trade off in which resistant genotypes are at a disadvantage in the absence of the pesticide however there appears to be no fitness trade off related to malathion resistance in t castaneum the resistant strain appears to have higher fitness even in the absence of malathion haubruge and arnaud 2001 cheung 2002 arnaud et al 2005 arnaud et al 2005 suggest that the higher fitness of malathion resistant genes may be the result of posterior modification of the insect genome after resistance became prevalent the genetics of malathion resistance varies among strains sometimes resistance is found to be polygenic while in other strains it is due to a dominant allele at a single autosomal locus wool et al 1982 cheung 2002 studied a tribolium strain in which resistance is primarily controlled by a single dominant allele or closely linked set of alleles we denote the resistant allele with r and the susceptible allele with s the genotypes are ss rs and rr since the resistant allele is almost completely dominant cheung assumed that the demographic rates of the rs genotype are identical to the demographic rates of the rr genotype i e 37 u rr n u rs n 38 f rr n f rs n for any population vector n cheung estimated u ss f ss u rr and u rr in the laboratory under three levels of malathion exposure 0 ppm 1 5 ppm and 3 ppm experimental populations were kept in 120 ml wheaton vials containing 20 grams of media 92 5 bleached white flour 5 dry brewer s yeast 1 5 ground fumigation and 1 sunflower oil the media containing 1 5 ppm and 3 ppm malathion was prepared by diluting malathion into the sunflower oil before adding to the flour each malathion treatment was initiated with 250 larva 5 pupa and 250 adults three treatment groups were established with different initial allele frequencies and four replicate populations in each treatment group populations in the two homozygous boundary treatments were initiated with all ss and rr insects in the evolving treatment each population was initiated with all ss larvae and pupae and with 245 ss and 5 rs adults resulting in an initial r allele frequency of 0 01 among adults all life stages in each population were counted once every two weeks for 80 weeks t 0 1 2 40 adult mortality was set at 50 by removing half the number of adults counted in the previous census minus the number of dead adults found in the current census one of the replicate populations in the evolving treatment group was lost to disease at week 56 t 28 parameters for rr and ss genotypes were estimated from homozygous populations with a maximum likelihood procedure which is described in section 2 of cheung 2002 the parameter values are given in table 2 5 1 dynamics under pesticide exposure fig 3 shows adult abundance data from cheung s experiments at 3 ppm malathion and the results of projections from the tribolium model using the parameters in table 2 under these conditions a homozygous ss population goes extinct fig 3a and a population of homozygous rr individuals persists at a stable equilibrium fig 3c when a small number of heterozygote rs individuals are introduced into a susceptible population evolutionary rescue saves the population from extinction fig 3b 1 1 noise induced oscillations occur in the resistant tribolium populations because the attractor on the resistant boundary is near the bifurcation threshold to a stable period two cycle matlab code and parameters used for fig 3 are in the online supplementary materials cheung 2002 estimated allele frequencies at the end of the experiment t 40 in the three surviving populations of the evolving treatment group by sampling and isolating 45 50 large larva or pupa mating them with ss genotypes and testing the survival of their offspring in malathion media to determine the genotypes of the sampled insects this yielded estimates of the frequency of the r allele of 0 857 0 948 and 0 889 with a mean and standard error of 0 898 0 027 in comparison at t 40 the model predicts a frequency of the r allele of 0 862 which is not statistically different from the mean experimental value p 0 31 5 2 boundary stability the stability of a population of the ss homozygote when invaded by the resistant allele is determined by the dominant eigenvalue ζ ss of the jacobian the final term in 35 simplifies significantly because the tribolium model contains only one reproducing stage if we denote the stage abundances at the susceptible equilibrium by l ˆ ss p ˆ ss d ˆ ss then 39 1 2 n b f ss n ˆ n ˆ ss c rs t β ss a ˆ ss e κ el ss l ˆ ss κ ea ss a ˆ ss e 1 e 3 t a ˆ ss 40 f ss n ˆ ss thus the ss equilibrium will be invaded by the resistant allele if 41 ζ ss ρ 0 0 1 2 β rs β ss e χ ss l ˆ ss ξ ss d ˆ ss 1 μ rs 0 0 0 e κ ss d ˆ ss 1 ν rs 1 at 3 ppm malathion ζ ss 1 8450 so the resistant allele is able to invade in the absence of malathion ζ ss 1 0265 so the resistant allele is superior even without the advantage of the presence of malathion since the model assumes complete dominance the rs and rr individuals have identical parameters this implies that ζ rr 1 and that linearization fails to show the stability of the equilibrium this is a well known phenomenon in models for selection against recessive alleles e g nagylaki 1992 sect 4 2 because recessive homozygotes are so rare close to the dominant equilibrium elimination of the recessive is extremely slow simulations however show that the resistant boundary is stable to invasion by the susceptible allele evolutionary stability analysis the analytical expression that determines stability of the homozygote boundaries allows us to study the effect of parameter changes on stability i e we can perform an evolutionary stability analysis to demonstrate such an analysis we explore the effects on stability of the degree of dominance of the resistant allele this analysis was inspired by beeman 1983 who found incomplete dominance of the resistant allele in the rmal strain of tribolium at high concentrations of malathion we analyze the effect of incomplete dominance by writing the heterozygote parameters as a convex combination of the parameters of the homozygotes e g for mortality 42 μ rs 1 x μ rr x μ ss and likewise for all other parameters in the model the parameter x weighs the relative effect of the two alleles on all vital rates in heterozygotes when x 1 the s allele is dominant and when x 0 the r allele is dominant fig 4 shows the dominant eigenvalue ζ evaluated at both boundary equilibria as a function of x the ss boundary is unstable in the range 0 1 the rr boundary is stable in the range 0 1 fig 5 shows the effect of dominance on the fixation time defined as the time required to reduce the frequency of the susceptible allele from 0 99 to 0 01 in the larvae alternative definitions of fixation time involving sums of stages rather than the larval stage alone result in the same qualitative shape using a different threshold to define allele fixation does effect the shape of the curve the initial increase of the resistant allele is faster at x 0 than at x 0 5 but the final approach to the boundary is faster at x 0 5 if we had defined competitive exclusion as the susceptible allele having a frequency less than 0 2 in larvae the line in fig 5 would be monotonically increasing with x 6 discussion demographic models classify individuals into i states such as age classes or developmental stages the i state captures all the relevant information about an individual such that the fate of an individual depends only on its current i state and the environment metz 1977 caswell and john 1992 caswell 2001 in this paper we extended the i state to include the individual genotype treating genotype as a demographic state variable makes the powerful mathematical machinery of matrix population models available for the study genotype stage dynamics figs 1 and 3 using genotype stage models makes the equally powerful mathematical machinery of matrix calculus available for stability analysis via linearization sections 4 and 5 using such a linearization we obtained conditions for the coexistence of two alleles at one locus for a general density dependent demographic model with age or stage structure this opens new possibilities for eco evolutionary analysis of life history traits it complements but is not intended to replace the quantitative genetics approaches recently developed by coulson et al 2010 we applied the model to study the genotype stage dynamics of pesticide resistance in tribolium castaneum the model does an excellent job of describing experimental populations exposed to malathion and successfully predicts the outcome of selection fixation of the resistant allele fixation would occur more quickly for intermediate dominance than for complete dominance fig 5 the invasion speed of a pesticide resistant allele in an agricultural pest is an important quantity for agriculturalists and or policy makers pesticide resistance in insects is often determined by only one or two loci roush and mckenzie 1987 ffrench constant et al 2004 for example a number of single gene mutations are known to result in ddt resistance in drosophila pittendrigh et al 1997 joussen et al 2008 similarly a single gene was found in houseflies that influences the rates of penetration of ddt and dieldrin by hoyer and plapp 1968 there are many more examples see reviews by georghiou 1969 roush and mckenzie 1987 or ffrench constant et al 2004 the one locus two allele model presented in this paper could therefore be applicable to many cases of insecticide resistance maximization principles early work on density dependent selection focused on the maximization of equilibrium population size hence k selection macarthur 1962 macarthur and wilson 1967 roughgarden 1971 charlesworth 1994 extended this result to age structured populations and showed that density dependent selection maximizes the abundance of the age class that is exerting the density dependent pressure on the population for example if adults cannibalize juveniles and juvenile mortality is a nonlinear function of adult density then a successful invasion will always lead to a higher adult density in deriving this result charlesworth assumes males and females have identical demographic rates i e there is no sexual dimorphism in any life history characteristics because one cannot in general find expressions for equilibria in nonlinear models we do not consider the maximization of density here moreover we note that in a structured model there is no reason to assume that density is a single scalar quantity e g caswell et al 2004 each stage may have its own effects on other stages a total density obtained by adding together tiny seedlings and big trees has little biological meaning equally each vital rate may be influenced by a different set of stages as in the tribolium model where fertility is a function of larval and adult densities but pupal survival depends only on adult density thus maximization of density will not be as simple a concept in structured models as it is in unstructured models extensions the model presented here can be extended by relaxing a number of assumptions our assumption of female dominance leads to the assumption that male and female population vectors are proportional so that the female population vector can be used to calculate gene frequencies in the male mating population de vries and caswell 2019a show that this assumption is met provided males and females have equal survival and transition probabilities and are born at equal proportions both these assumptions could be relaxed in a two sex model the model could also be extended to include more ecological interaction such as time dependent demographic rates interactions among species or dependence on environmental resources the genetic component of the model can be expanded to include nonrandom mating more than two alleles or mutations at the cost of additional mathematics our results could be extended to dynamics on the boundaries that are more exotic than fixed points a k point cycle for example can be transformed into an equilibrium by studying the k fold map i e by applying the population projection matrix k times we did not discuss frequency dependent selection in this paper in which the vital rates of an individual are a function of the frequencies of the genotypes in the population negative frequency dependent selection in which the fitness of a genotype declines as its frequency increases is often invoked as a mechanisms for maintaining polymorphisms in a structured population the demographic rates could depend on the genotype frequencies in some subset of stages rather than in the entire population in species with alternative mating strategies the mating strategies often show negative frequency dependence e g studies of salmon by gross 1985 berejikian et al 2010 incorporating frequency dependence in our model would permit analysis of such traits the model construction introduced in this paper remains unchanged for frequency dependent models or for models with both frequency dependence and density dependence however a model with only frequency dependence becomes linear on the boundaries therefore the population is either exponentially growing or shrinking rather than at equilibrium on the boundary to calculate the vulnerability of the homozygote population to invasion by the other allele in a frequency dependent model it would be necessary to renormalize the population vector and to project the resulting frequency vector instead as is discussed in de vries and caswell 2019b conclusion we began this paper by emphasizing how demographic and genetic processes combine to determine eco evolutionary dynamics at this point we have shown several examples of how mendelian genetics and density dependent vital rates combined into a stage genotype structured matrix model can be used to this end the genotypes determine survival transitions and fertility the rules of mating and segregation determine the genetic composition of offspring the model can project dynamics of joint stage genotype distributions for hypothetical fig 1 and experimental fig 3 situations the eventual genetic coexistence is determined by stability analysis of the

model the local stability of a homozygote boundary equilibrium is determined by the largest eigenvalue in absolute value of the jacobian matrix of the nonlinear matrix model evaluated at that equilibrium we denote this eigenvalue at the aa boundary by ζ aa and at the aa boundary by ζ aa if the magnitude of the dominant eigenvalue of the jacobian matrix is larger than one when evaluated at an equilibrium then this equilibrium is unstable the jacobian matrix a 1 m d n t 1 d n t t n ˆ is obtained by differentiating eq 3 a 2 n t 1 a n n t and evaluating the resulting derivative at the boundary equilibrium this requires a long series of matrix calculus operations magnus and neudecker 1985 caswell 2008 the analysis repeatedly takes advantage of the fact that n ˆ at the aa boundary contains zeros for the blocks corresponding to aa and aa genotypes differentiate eq a 2 to obtain a 3 d n t 1 a d n t d a n t where the explicit dependence of a on n has been omitted to avoid a cluttering of brackets multiply the second term by an ωg ωg identity matrix a 4 d n t 1 a d n t i ω g d a n t and apply the vec operator to both sides remembering that as n is a vector vec n n a 5 d n

24939,the study of eco evolutionary dynamics is based on the idea that ecological and evolutionary processes may operate on the same or very similar time scales and that interactions of ecological and evolutionary processes may have important consequences here we develop a model that combines mendelian population genetics with nonlinear demography to create a truly eco evolutionary model we use the vec permutation matrix approach classifying individuals by stage and genotype the demographic component is female dominant and density dependent the genetic component includes random mating by stage and genotype and arbitrary effects of genotype on the demographic phenotype mutation is neglected the result is a nonlinear matrix population model that projects the stage genotype distribution we show that the results can include bifurcations of population dynamics driven by the response to selection we present analytical criteria that determine whether one allele excludes the other or if they persist in a protected polymorphism the results are based on local stability analysis of the homozygous boundary equilibria as an example we use a density dependent stage classified model of the flour beetle tribolium castaneum our model permits arbitrary life cycle complexity and nonlinearity tribolium has developed resistance to the pesticide malathion due to a dominant allele at a single autosomal locus using parameters reported from laboratory experiments we show that the model successfully describes the dynamics of both resistant and susceptible homozygotes and the outcome of a selection experiment containing both alleles stability analysis of the boundary equilibria confirms that the resistant allele excludes the susceptible allele even in the absence of malathion agreeing with previously reported results keywords eco evolutionary dynamics evolutionary demography density dependent selection protected polymorphism pesticide resistance stability analysis 1 introduction the demographic processes of birth and death drive changes in gene frequencies and changes in population density and structure demography is therefore central to understanding ecology and evolution and eco evolutionary analyses always strive to incorporate the fundamental demographic processes of birth death and development e g coulson et al 2006 metcalf and pavard 2007 de vries and caswell 2019b recently introduced an eco evolutionary framework that combines matrix population models with basic mendelian genetics here we use this framework to explore density dependent selection density dependence occurs when the per capita vital rates rates of birth mortality and development depend on population size or density density dependence may be negative or positive allee effects in models that contain demographic structure density is a multivariate concept vital rates may depend on the abundance of a particular stage or age class or on a weighted density that gives distinct weights to different stages rather than the total population density caswell et al 2004 for example density dependent effects due to difficulty in finding mates leads to fertilities that depend on the abundances or densities of reproducing stages cannabilism is usually restricted to large individuals eating smaller conspecifics so density dependent effects due to cannibalism are size or stage specific we will assume that genotypes can differ in age or stage specific rates of development survival or fertility anywhere in the life cycle thus we assume that pleiotropic effects are the rule rather than the exception early theoretical work on density dependent selection macarthur 1962 roughgarden 1971 combined population genetics with unstructured ecological models by writing genotype fitnesses as a function of genotypic densities macarthur and wilson 1967 and roughgarden 1971 extended the logistic equation to multiple competing genotypes and showed that selection leads to an increase in population density in a constant environment because only alleles with heterozygote advantage in the carrying capacity can invade this result leads to the ideas of r and k selection charlesworth 1971 extended this to any fitness function that decreases with population densities charlesworth 1994 used high order difference equations to model density dependent selection in age structured populations in this paper we will incorporate age or stage structure by using matrix population models rather than scalar difference equations in this paper we show how to construct a density dependent mendelian matrix population model based on genotype specific demographic measurements we show how to use that model to project the stage genotype distribution and derive analytical conditions that determine whether alleles will coexist in a genetic polymorphism or if one or another allele will go to fixation we apply the analysis to a study of pesticide resistance in tribolium beetles a species that is a pest of stored grain products we investigate the effect of incomplete dominance on the speed of invasion and on the outcome of invasion using evolutionary stability analysis 2 model construction individuals are jointly classified by stage 1 ω and by genotype 1 g each genotype is characterized by a survival and transition matrix and a matrix of fertility rates both the transition matrices and the fertility matrices are assumed to be density dependent in this section we will consider general density dependence without specifying a functional dependence in section 3 we apply the general results obtained to a specific model with density dependent demographic rates we make the important assumption of female demographic dominance i e we assume that enough males are always present to fertilize all the females and that the number of offspring produced in a mating is not affected by the stage or genotype i e the i state of the male this assumption can be relaxed by introducing a marriage function but we do not explore that here we also assume that males and females have the same survival and transition rates and that male and female offspring are produced in equal proportions these two assumptions imply that the male and female genotype stage population vectors remain equal provided they start equal de vries and caswell 2019a therefore we can treat the female vector as representative of both the male and the female populations and we can calculate allele frequencies in the breeding population from the female population vector these assumptions make it possible to model sexual reproduction in a one sex model the matrices vectors and mathematical operations used in this paper are listed in table 1 matrices are denoted by bold upper case letters e g u and vectors by bold lower case letters e g n following caswell et al 2018 we use a tilde e g u n to denote block structured matrices and vectors whose entries describe both demographic stage and genotype for a single locus with 2 alleles say a and a we will identify genotypes 1 2 and 3 as aa aa and aa respectively the population state vector is 1 n t n aa t n aa t n aa t where e g n aa contains the numbers or densities of stages 1 s for genotype aa the population vector n is projected from time t to time t 1 by a denisty dependent matrix a n so that 2 n t 1 a n n t 3 u n f n n t where u describes survival and transition rates and f reproduction the population projection matrix a depends on n because of genetics the genotypes of offspring depend on gene frequencies of parents and because of ecological nonlinearities due to density dependence the genetic component of the model depends on the normalized population distribution vector p t defined as 4 p t n t n t where denotes the 1 norm the normalized population distribution vector consists of three genotype specific population vectors 5 p t p aa t p aa t p aa t 2 1 the components of the population projection matrix the population projection matrix is constructed from two sets of matrices describing demographic transitions for each genotype and one set of matrices describing the parent offspring map for each stage u i n demographic transitions for females of genotype i i 1 g ω ω f i n fertility matrix for females of genotype i i 1 g ω ω h j n parent offspring map for stage j j 1 s g g the matrix u i n contains the stage specific density dependent transition and survival rates for females of genotype i the matrix f i n contains stage specific density dependent fertility rates for females of genotype i the matrices h j n map the genotype of a mother in stage j to the genotypes of her offspring the k ℓ entry of h j is the probability that the offspring of a genotype ℓ mother of stage j has genotype k we assume that mating is random with respect to stage and hence that the parent offspring map is the same for all stages i e h j n h n assortative mating by stage would lead to differences among the h j the matrix h n is discussed in section 2 3 the model also formally contains matrices describing the transitions of individuals among genotype classes for each age or stage caswell et al 2018 but since individuals do not change genotypes these are identity matrices 2 2 mating from genotypes of parents to genotypes of offspring non reproductive e g immature stages play no role in mating hence following de vries and caswell 2019b we define the breeding population by an indicator vector c j for j 1 g that shows which stages of genotype j take part in mating the ith entry of c j is 1 if individuals of stage i and genotype j reproduce and 0 otherwise the size of the breeding population is then 6 n b i 1 g e i t c i t n where e i is a vector g 1 with a 1 in position i and zeros elsewhere and indicates the kronecker product breeding stages are allowed to differ among genotypes in order to study the fate of traits that change reproductive schedules in the special case where the genotypes do not differ in their reproductive stages c i c for all genotypes i and 7 n b 1 g t c t n where 1 g t is a vector of ones of dimensions 1 g the genotype frequency vector within the breeding population is 8 p b x n n b where 9 x i 1 g e ii c i t with e ii a matrix of dimension g g with a 1 in the i i location and zeros elsewhere if the breeding vectors are the same for all genotypes c i c then 10 x i g c t the genotype frequency vector for genotype i is trivially p i e i the gene frequencies in an individual of genotype i q i and the gene frequencies in the breeding population q b are functions of the genotype frequencies so that 11 q i w p i 12 q b w p b where for the 2 allele case 13 w 1 0 5 0 0 0 5 1 combining eqs 8 and 12 yields the following expression for the gene frequencies in the breeding population 14 q b q a b q a b w x n n b we set mutation rates to zero see de vries and caswell 2019b for details on how mutation could be included 2 3 the matrix h when a female randomly picks an allele from the gamete pool she will pick allele a with probability q a b and allele a with probability q a b these probabilities therefore determine the distribution of genotypes in her offspring which is captured in the matrix h p 15 h p q a b 1 2 q a b 0 q a b 1 2 q a b 0 1 2 q a b q a b the first column of h p contains the genotype distribution in the offspring of an aa mother she produces an aa offspring with probability q a b and an aa offspring with probability q a b the second and third columns give the genotype distributions for mothers of genotypes aa and aa the matrix h is a homogenous function of degree zero of the population vector n since h α n h n thus we can write it equally as a function of n or p for a step by step derivation of h see de vries and caswell 2019b section 2 3 and appendix a 2 4 the population projection matrix to project the eco evolutionary dynamics the component matrices u i n and f i n must be incorporated into the population projection matrix a n e g caswell et al 2018 to do so create a set of block diagonal matrices u f and ℍ that contain the corresponding demographic matrices on the diagonal i e 16 u i 1 g e i i u i n 17 f i 1 g e i i f i n 18 ℍ i ω h p the fertility matrix f n is constructed from the block matrix containing genotype specific fertility rates and from the parent to offspring genotype map 19 f n k t ℍ p k f n where k is the vec permutation matrix henderson and searle 1981 which changes the arrangement of the vector from stages within genotypes to genotypes within stages from right to left the block diagonal matrix f first produces offspring possibly of different birth stages e g seedlings of different sizes as a function of the genotype of the mother when they appear these offspring are associated with the genotype of the mother the vec permutation matrix k rearranges the vector and then the block diagonal matrix ℍ p allocates the offspring to their genotypes based on the genotype of their mother and the genotype distribution of the rest of the population finally k t returns the vector to its original arrangement this vec permutation approach to constructing matrix population models was introduced by hunter and caswell 2005 and is described in more detail by caswell 2012 caswell and salguero gómez 2013 caswell et al 2018 and caswell 2019 the fertility matrix f n captures the process of mendelian inheritance substituting eqs 15 17 and 18 into eq 19 yields 20 the first block column of f n contains the offspring produced by an aa female the upper left block in the first column q a f aa n gives the production of aa offspring by aa females that randomly pick allele a from the gamete pool which happens with probability q a the next block down q a f aa n contains the production of aa offspring by an aa female picking allele a from the gamete pool similarly the second and third row blocks contain offspring produced by an aa female and an aa female respectively since individuals do not change their genotype once they are born the survival matrix is the block diagonal matrices 21 u n k t i ω g k u u or written in terms of the genotype specific block matrices 22 we project the stage genotype dynamics with u n in eq 22 and f n in eq 20 using eq 3 3 stage genotype dynamics of tribolium flour beetles of the genus tribolium have been used extensively to study population dynamics and population genetics see costantino et al 2005 for a review tribolium is an economically important pest of flour and stored grain products a nonlinear matrix population model for tribolium was developed by cushing and collaborators see for example cushing et al 2002 the tribolium model contains three stages larvae l pupae p and adults d it is nonlinear because in addition to feeding on flour tribolium adults cannibalize eggs and pupae larvae in turn cannibalize eggs these nonlinearities lead to a plethora of interesting bifurcations attractors and transient and asymptotic dynamics which have been studied extensively costantino et al 1995 1997 2005 henson et al 2002 cushing et al 2002 edmunds et al 2003 we use the tribolium model as the basis for a genetic model by including one locus two allele a and a mendelian genetics we define effective adult densities d and d and an effective larval density l as linear combinations of the genotype densities 23 d κ aa d aa κ aa d aa κ aa d aa 24 d ξ aa d aa ξ aa d aa ξ aa d aa 25 l χ aa l aa χ aa l aa χ aa l aa and use these to express the density effects of pupa cannibalism by adults 23 and egg cannibalism by adults 24 and larva 25 each genotype i has a survival and transition matrix 26 u i 0 0 0 1 μ i 0 0 0 e d 1 ν i where μ i and ν i are the larval and adult mortality rates respectively in addition each genotype i has a fertility matrix 27 f i 0 0 β i e l d 0 0 0 0 0 0 where β i is the fecundity at low densities this parameterization permits selection to operate on any of the life history characteristics i e stage specific viability fertility and or cannibalism rates genotype stage dynamics as an example of genotype stage dynamics we use parameters estimated from a laboratory population of tribolium by dennis et al 1995 table 2 we introduce a hypothetical allele with additive effects on fecundity parameter β the simulation was initialized with a population of aa individuals with low fecundity at the stage distribution of the homozygote equilibrium after 50 iterations one larval heterozygote is introduced into the population with a fecundity exactly in between the two homozygotes the invading allele with larger birthrate gradually takes over the population and becomes fixed as the genetic composition of the population changes fig 1 c and d the population structure changes fig 1a and b eventually as the population approaches the aa boundary the dynamics bifurcate from a stable equilibrium to a two point cycle matlab code and parameters used for fig 1 are in the online supplementary materials 4 the outcome of density dependent selection conditions for genotype coexistence the most basic question about selection density dependent or otherwise is the question of whether genotypes coexist so that the population retains some degree of genetic diversity or whether one allele becomes fixed the question becomes more complicated but no less basic when demographic structure and nonlinearity are included in this section we present a general condition for determining the outcome of selection the dynamics of n take place in an ωg dimensional space defined by combinations of ω stages and g genotypes with g 3 in the present context in the absence of mutation the ω dimensional boundary subspaces corresponding to the homozygous genotypes aa and aa are invariant under the dynamics specified by a n these dynamics are given by the nonlinear projection matrices for the homozygous genotypes fig 2 we assume the existence of a single equilibrium on each boundary and that this equilibrium is stable with respect to perturbations in the boundary subspace coexistence of the two alleles in a protected polymorphism levene 1953 prout 1968 see nagylaki 1992 chap 6 results when the boundary subspaces are both unstable to perturbations into the interior that is if allele a can invade a population of aa individuals and allele a can invade a population of aa individuals then a homozygote state can never be reached again once both alleles are present in the population since both alleles grow when rare mutual invasibility therefore leads to a protected genetic polymorphism in general the dynamics in the interior are unknown and could include multiple equilibria strange attractors cycles etc provided both boundary subspaces are unstable to perturbations into the interior we refer to any of the possibly exotic dynamics in the interior as a protected polymorphism in general nonlinear models could possess multiple invariant sets equilibria cycles strange attractors on the boundary we restrict our discussion to models with a unique equilibrium on the boundary extending the analysis to include a k cycle on the boundary would be accomplished by transforming the k point cycle into an equilibrium of the k fold map but we do not consider this here 4 1 stability of the homozygote boundaries the stability of a boundary equilibrium is determined by the spectral radius i e the magnitude of the eigenvalue with the largest magnitude of the jacobian matrix at the equilibrium we denote this eigenvalue by ζ aa and ζ aa for the aa and aa boundaries respectively if ζ 1 the equilibrium is stable if ζ 1 it is unstable we assume that the boundary equilibria are locally stable to perturbations within the boundary subspace so if the equilibrium is unstable the associated eigenvector must point into the interior which implies that the invading allele increases when rare the jacobian matrix 28 m d n t 1 d n t t n ˆ is obtained by differentiating eq 3 and evaluating the resulting derivative at the boundary equilibrium here we give the jacobian at the aa boundary the expression at the aa boundary can be derived afterwards by symmetry the jacobian matrix at the aa boundary is 29 m a n ˆ e 1 n ˆ aa t i ω vec u aa n t n ˆ e 1 n ˆ aa t i ω vec f aa n t n ˆ ecological nonlinearity e 1 i ω f aa n ˆ aa q a n t n ˆ e 2 i ω f aa n ˆ aa q a n t n ˆ genetic nonlinearity see appendix a for a derivation the linearization reflects the two sources of nonlinearity in the model those due to ecological density dependence and those due to the genetic frequency dependence the matrix m is a block structured matrix with blocks corresponding to genotypes and entries within the blocks corresponding to stages within genotypes 30 the block m 11 represents the contribution of perturbations in the aa direction to growth or decline of perturbations in the aa direction block m 12 represents the contribution of perturbations in the aa direction to growth or decline of perturbations in the aa direction etc all of the blocks in the jacobian are given with their derivation in appendix a evaluated at the equilibrium on the aa boundary the jacobian matrix m is block upper triangular with 31 m 21 m 31 m 32 0 see eq a 35 in appendix a thus the spectral radius of m depends on the eigenvalues of the diagonal blocks block m 33 u aa projects perturbations in the aa direction and since ρ u aa 1 this direction is always stable the block m 11 projects perturbations within the aa boundary by assumption the boundary equilibrium is stable to such perturbations so the spectral radius of m 11 must be less than one the stability of the aa boundary equilibrium therefore depends on the spectral radius of the submatrix m 22 32 m 22 u aa n ˆ 1 2 f aa n ˆ 1 2 n b f aa n ˆ aa c aa t where n b is the number of individuals that are in a breeding stage at the equilibrium see appendix a because m 22 is non negative its largest eigenvalue is real and corresponds to the spectral radius we denote the maximum eigenvalue of m 22 as 33 ζ aa ρ m 22 where ρ denotes the spectral radius of the matrix by symmetry the dominant eigenvalue of the jacobian matrix at the aa boundary denoted by ζ aa is obtained by replacing aa by aa in 32 criteria for a polymorphism a protected polymorphism occurs when both boundaries are unstable i e when 34 ζ aa 1 and ζ aa 1 the inequalities in eq 34 are satisfied if and only if 35 ρ u aa n ˆ 1 2 f aa n ˆ 1 2 n b f aa n ˆ aa c aa t 1 36 ρ u aa n ˆ 1 2 f aa n ˆ 1 2 n b f aa n ˆ aa c aa t 1 we note that the conditions for polymorphism in eqs 35 and 36 are a function of the nonlinear demographic rates of both the invading heterozygote and the resident homozygote through the matrices u i and f i and of the structure of the homozygote equilibrium n ˆ aa or n ˆ aa 5 tribolium revisited density dependent selection and pesticide resistance armed with these coexistence conditions we return to tribolium to study the spread of malathion resistance in the red flour beetle tribolium castaneum malathion was a commonly used pesticide in grain storage in the 1950s and malathion resistance has since become widespread in tribolium castaneum the evolution of pesticide resistance is usually assumed to involve a fitness trade off in which resistant genotypes are at a disadvantage in the absence of the pesticide however there appears to be no fitness trade off related to malathion resistance in t castaneum the resistant strain appears to have higher fitness even in the absence of malathion haubruge and arnaud 2001 cheung 2002 arnaud et al 2005 arnaud et al 2005 suggest that the higher fitness of malathion resistant genes may be the result of posterior modification of the insect genome after resistance became prevalent the genetics of malathion resistance varies among strains sometimes resistance is found to be polygenic while in other strains it is due to a dominant allele at a single autosomal locus wool et al 1982 cheung 2002 studied a tribolium strain in which resistance is primarily controlled by a single dominant allele or closely linked set of alleles we denote the resistant allele with r and the susceptible allele with s the genotypes are ss rs and rr since the resistant allele is almost completely dominant cheung assumed that the demographic rates of the rs genotype are identical to the demographic rates of the rr genotype i e 37 u rr n u rs n 38 f rr n f rs n for any population vector n cheung estimated u ss f ss u rr and u rr in the laboratory under three levels of malathion exposure 0 ppm 1 5 ppm and 3 ppm experimental populations were kept in 120 ml wheaton vials containing 20 grams of media 92 5 bleached white flour 5 dry brewer s yeast 1 5 ground fumigation and 1 sunflower oil the media containing 1 5 ppm and 3 ppm malathion was prepared by diluting malathion into the sunflower oil before adding to the flour each malathion treatment was initiated with 250 larva 5 pupa and 250 adults three treatment groups were established with different initial allele frequencies and four replicate populations in each treatment group populations in the two homozygous boundary treatments were initiated with all ss and rr insects in the evolving treatment each population was initiated with all ss larvae and pupae and with 245 ss and 5 rs adults resulting in an initial r allele frequency of 0 01 among adults all life stages in each population were counted once every two weeks for 80 weeks t 0 1 2 40 adult mortality was set at 50 by removing half the number of adults counted in the previous census minus the number of dead adults found in the current census one of the replicate populations in the evolving treatment group was lost to disease at week 56 t 28 parameters for rr and ss genotypes were estimated from homozygous populations with a maximum likelihood procedure which is described in section 2 of cheung 2002 the parameter values are given in table 2 5 1 dynamics under pesticide exposure fig 3 shows adult abundance data from cheung s experiments at 3 ppm malathion and the results of projections from the tribolium model using the parameters in table 2 under these conditions a homozygous ss population goes extinct fig 3a and a population of homozygous rr individuals persists at a stable equilibrium fig 3c when a small number of heterozygote rs individuals are introduced into a susceptible population evolutionary rescue saves the population from extinction fig 3b 1 1 noise induced oscillations occur in the resistant tribolium populations because the attractor on the resistant boundary is near the bifurcation threshold to a stable period two cycle matlab code and parameters used for fig 3 are in the online supplementary materials cheung 2002 estimated allele frequencies at the end of the experiment t 40 in the three surviving populations of the evolving treatment group by sampling and isolating 45 50 large larva or pupa mating them with ss genotypes and testing the survival of their offspring in malathion media to determine the genotypes of the sampled insects this yielded estimates of the frequency of the r allele of 0 857 0 948 and 0 889 with a mean and standard error of 0 898 0 027 in comparison at t 40 the model predicts a frequency of the r allele of 0 862 which is not statistically different from the mean experimental value p 0 31 5 2 boundary stability the stability of a population of the ss homozygote when invaded by the resistant allele is determined by the dominant eigenvalue ζ ss of the jacobian the final term in 35 simplifies significantly because the tribolium model contains only one reproducing stage if we denote the stage abundances at the susceptible equilibrium by l ˆ ss p ˆ ss d ˆ ss then 39 1 2 n b f ss n ˆ n ˆ ss c rs t β ss a ˆ ss e κ el ss l ˆ ss κ ea ss a ˆ ss e 1 e 3 t a ˆ ss 40 f ss n ˆ ss thus the ss equilibrium will be invaded by the resistant allele if 41 ζ ss ρ 0 0 1 2 β rs β ss e χ ss l ˆ ss ξ ss d ˆ ss 1 μ rs 0 0 0 e κ ss d ˆ ss 1 ν rs 1 at 3 ppm malathion ζ ss 1 8450 so the resistant allele is able to invade in the absence of malathion ζ ss 1 0265 so the resistant allele is superior even without the advantage of the presence of malathion since the model assumes complete dominance the rs and rr individuals have identical parameters this implies that ζ rr 1 and that linearization fails to show the stability of the equilibrium this is a well known phenomenon in models for selection against recessive alleles e g nagylaki 1992 sect 4 2 because recessive homozygotes are so rare close to the dominant equilibrium elimination of the recessive is extremely slow simulations however show that the resistant boundary is stable to invasion by the susceptible allele evolutionary stability analysis the analytical expression that determines stability of the homozygote boundaries allows us to study the effect of parameter changes on stability i e we can perform an evolutionary stability analysis to demonstrate such an analysis we explore the effects on stability of the degree of dominance of the resistant allele this analysis was inspired by beeman 1983 who found incomplete dominance of the resistant allele in the rmal strain of tribolium at high concentrations of malathion we analyze the effect of incomplete dominance by writing the heterozygote parameters as a convex combination of the parameters of the homozygotes e g for mortality 42 μ rs 1 x μ rr x μ ss and likewise for all other parameters in the model the parameter x weighs the relative effect of the two alleles on all vital rates in heterozygotes when x 1 the s allele is dominant and when x 0 the r allele is dominant fig 4 shows the dominant eigenvalue ζ evaluated at both boundary equilibria as a function of x the ss boundary is unstable in the range 0 1 the rr boundary is stable in the range 0 1 fig 5 shows the effect of dominance on the fixation time defined as the time required to reduce the frequency of the susceptible allele from 0 99 to 0 01 in the larvae alternative definitions of fixation time involving sums of stages rather than the larval stage alone result in the same qualitative shape using a different threshold to define allele fixation does effect the shape of the curve the initial increase of the resistant allele is faster at x 0 than at x 0 5 but the final approach to the boundary is faster at x 0 5 if we had defined competitive exclusion as the susceptible allele having a frequency less than 0 2 in larvae the line in fig 5 would be monotonically increasing with x 6 discussion demographic models classify individuals into i states such as age classes or developmental stages the i state captures all the relevant information about an individual such that the fate of an individual depends only on its current i state and the environment metz 1977 caswell and john 1992 caswell 2001 in this paper we extended the i state to include the individual genotype treating genotype as a demographic state variable makes the powerful mathematical machinery of matrix population models available for the study genotype stage dynamics figs 1 and 3 using genotype stage models makes the equally powerful mathematical machinery of matrix calculus available for stability analysis via linearization sections 4 and 5 using such a linearization we obtained conditions for the coexistence of two alleles at one locus for a general density dependent demographic model with age or stage structure this opens new possibilities for eco evolutionary analysis of life history traits it complements but is not intended to replace the quantitative genetics approaches recently developed by coulson et al 2010 we applied the model to study the genotype stage dynamics of pesticide resistance in tribolium castaneum the model does an excellent job of describing experimental populations exposed to malathion and successfully predicts the outcome of selection fixation of the resistant allele fixation would occur more quickly for intermediate dominance than for complete dominance fig 5 the invasion speed of a pesticide resistant allele in an agricultural pest is an important quantity for agriculturalists and or policy makers pesticide resistance in insects is often determined by only one or two loci roush and mckenzie 1987 ffrench constant et al 2004 for example a number of single gene mutations are known to result in ddt resistance in drosophila pittendrigh et al 1997 joussen et al 2008 similarly a single gene was found in houseflies that influences the rates of penetration of ddt and dieldrin by hoyer and plapp 1968 there are many more examples see reviews by georghiou 1969 roush and mckenzie 1987 or ffrench constant et al 2004 the one locus two allele model presented in this paper could therefore be applicable to many cases of insecticide resistance maximization principles early work on density dependent selection focused on the maximization of equilibrium population size hence k selection macarthur 1962 macarthur and wilson 1967 roughgarden 1971 charlesworth 1994 extended this result to age structured populations and showed that density dependent selection maximizes the abundance of the age class that is exerting the density dependent pressure on the population for example if adults cannibalize juveniles and juvenile mortality is a nonlinear function of adult density then a successful invasion will always lead to a higher adult density in deriving this result charlesworth assumes males and females have identical demographic rates i e there is no sexual dimorphism in any life history characteristics because one cannot in general find expressions for equilibria in nonlinear models we do not consider the maximization of density here moreover we note that in a structured model there is no reason to assume that density is a single scalar quantity e g caswell et al 2004 each stage may have its own effects on other stages a total density obtained by adding together tiny seedlings and big trees has little biological meaning equally each vital rate may be influenced by a different set of stages as in the tribolium model where fertility is a function of larval and adult densities but pupal survival depends only on adult density thus maximization of density will not be as simple a concept in structured models as it is in unstructured models extensions the model presented here can be extended by relaxing a number of assumptions our assumption of female dominance leads to the assumption that male and female population vectors are proportional so that the female population vector can be used to calculate gene frequencies in the male mating population de vries and caswell 2019a show that this assumption is met provided males and females have equal survival and transition probabilities and are born at equal proportions both these assumptions could be relaxed in a two sex model the model could also be extended to include more ecological interaction such as time dependent demographic rates interactions among species or dependence on environmental resources the genetic component of the model can be expanded to include nonrandom mating more than two alleles or mutations at the cost of additional mathematics our results could be extended to dynamics on the boundaries that are more exotic than fixed points a k point cycle for example can be transformed into an equilibrium by studying the k fold map i e by applying the population projection matrix k times we did not discuss frequency dependent selection in this paper in which the vital rates of an individual are a function of the frequencies of the genotypes in the population negative frequency dependent selection in which the fitness of a genotype declines as its frequency increases is often invoked as a mechanisms for maintaining polymorphisms in a structured population the demographic rates could depend on the genotype frequencies in some subset of stages rather than in the entire population in species with alternative mating strategies the mating strategies often show negative frequency dependence e g studies of salmon by gross 1985 berejikian et al 2010 incorporating frequency dependence in our model would permit analysis of such traits the model construction introduced in this paper remains unchanged for frequency dependent models or for models with both frequency dependence and density dependence however a model with only frequency dependence becomes linear on the boundaries therefore the population is either exponentially growing or shrinking rather than at equilibrium on the boundary to calculate the vulnerability of the homozygote population to invasion by the other allele in a frequency dependent model it would be necessary to renormalize the population vector and to project the resulting frequency vector instead as is discussed in de vries and caswell 2019b conclusion we began this paper by emphasizing how demographic and genetic processes combine to determine eco evolutionary dynamics at this point we have shown several examples of how mendelian genetics and density dependent vital rates combined into a stage genotype structured matrix model can be used to this end the genotypes determine survival transitions and fertility the rules of mating and segregation determine the genetic composition of offspring the model can project dynamics of joint stage genotype distributions for hypothetical fig 1 and experimental fig 3 situations the eventual genetic coexistence is determined by stability analysis of the

model the local stability of a homozygote boundary equilibrium is determined by the largest eigenvalue in absolute value of the jacobian matrix of the nonlinear matrix model evaluated at that equilibrium we denote this eigenvalue at the aa boundary by ζ aa and at the aa boundary by ζ aa if the magnitude of the dominant eigenvalue of the jacobian matrix is larger than one when evaluated at an equilibrium then this equilibrium is unstable the jacobian matrix a 1 m d n t 1 d n t t n ˆ is obtained by differentiating eq 3 a 2 n t 1 a n n t and evaluating the resulting derivative at the boundary equilibrium this requires a long series of matrix calculus operations magnus and neudecker 1985 caswell 2008 the analysis repeatedly takes advantage of the fact that n ˆ at the aa boundary contains zeros for the blocks corresponding to aa and aa genotypes differentiate eq a 2 to obtain a 3 d n t 1 a d n t d a n t where the explicit dependence of a on n has been omitted to avoid a cluttering of brackets multiply the second term by an ωg ωg identity matrix a 4 d n t 1 a d n t i ω g d a n t and apply the vec operator to both sides remembering that as n is a vector vec n n a 5 d n

be decomposed into nine ω ω block matrices which are created by adding eqs 22 and 20 a 7 the blocks are denoted by a ij so that for example a 8 a 11 u aa q a f aa and a 9 a 31 0 the matrix a can then be written as a 10 a i j 1 3 e ij a ij a 11 i j 1 3 e i e j t a ij i ω where we have used the definition of the matrix e ij e i e j t using ac bd a b c d eq a 11 can be rewritten as a 12 a i j 1 3 e i a ij e j t i ω next use the identity i e i i ω a ij i e i a ij to write a 13 a i j 1 3 e i i ω a ij e j t i ω this yields the following formula for veca a 14 vec a i j 3 e j i ω e i i ω vec a ij armed with this expression for vec a we analyze the term n t t i ω g d vec a in a 6 replace the derivative of vec a with eq a 14 such that a 15 n t t i ω g d vec a i j 1 3 n t t i ω g e j i ω e i i ω d vec a ij use a b c d ac bd to rewrite a 16 n t t i ω g e j i ω e i i ω n t e j i ω i ω g e i i ω substituting this expression into the right hand side of eq a 15 yields a 17 n t t i ω g d vec a i j 1 3 n

only terms with j 1 are nonzero yields a 19 n t t i ω g d vec a n ˆ i 3 n ˆ aa t e i i ω d vec a i 1 n ˆ the a i1 matrices are the matrices in the first block column of a see eq a 7 i e a 20 a 11 u aa

equilibrium finally the first identification theorem magnus and neudecker 1985 1988 and the chain rule together give the following formula for the jacobian a 24 m d n t 1 d n t n ˆ a n ˆ n ˆ aa t e 1

to write n ˆ aa t e 1 i ω as e 1 n ˆ aa t i ω and likewise for the term n ˆ aa t e 2 i ω also note that the two terms with partial derivates of q a can be rewritten using z t x vec y vec x y z to obtain the following expression a 26 m a n ˆ e 1 n ˆ aa t i ω vec u aa n t n ˆ e 1 n ˆ aa t i ω vec f aa n t n ˆ e 1 i ω f aa n ˆ aa q a n t n ˆ e 2 i ω f aa n ˆ aa q a n t n ˆ to proceed we need an
