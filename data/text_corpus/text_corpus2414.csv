solar energy the lower ambient temperature in one day could be preferred to achieve a higher output than higher solar radiation in another day tem produced 8 times the average productivity of glass the use of tem improves the temperature difference from glass water and hence the productivity forced convection by a condenser fan in a condenser chamber by the use of electricity provided by a thermoelectric device as a consequence of recycling of the latent condensation heat the daily water production of the system increases by 14 compared to the case of no propeller fan the cold side of the thermal module appeared to have a lower temperature than the ground then a higher temperature differential is achieved using the tem the more significant temperature gap in solar energy even with tem is around 2 3 times more as compared with traditional water productivity the use of an external thermo electric condenser channel and nanoparticles cu2o increases the daily energy efficiency of single slope solar still tem s output is adversely affected by the rise in the strength of solar radiation and increased solar radiation intensities have beneficial effects on the efficiency of the vacuum evaporator the thermoelectric efficiency of the condenser is five times the cooling side of the water film also the thermoelectricity output of the condenser is 4 times higher than that of the condenser cooling the fact that the exergy of incident solar radiation and electrical exergy in the thermoelectric module are relatively high is due to their low exergy performance in contrast the exergy of evaporative heat transfer on both the glass and the cold thermoelectric surface is small tem with the solar still found an excellent option to provide the potable water along with the

solar energy the lower ambient temperature in one day could be preferred to achieve a higher output than higher solar radiation in another day tem produced 8 times the average productivity of glass the use of tem improves the temperature difference from glass water and hence the productivity forced convection by a condenser fan in a condenser chamber by the use of electricity provided by a thermoelectric device as a consequence of recycling of the latent condensation heat the daily water production of the system increases by 14 compared to the case of no propeller fan the cold side of the thermal module appeared to have a lower temperature than the ground then a higher temperature differential is achieved using the tem the more significant temperature gap in solar energy even with tem is around 2 3 times more as compared with traditional water productivity the use of an external thermo electric condenser channel and nanoparticles cu2o increases the daily energy efficiency of single slope solar still tem s output is adversely affected by the rise in the strength of solar radiation and increased solar radiation intensities have beneficial effects on the efficiency of the vacuum evaporator the thermoelectric efficiency of the condenser is five times the cooling side of the water film also the thermoelectricity output of the condenser is 4 times higher than that of the condenser cooling the fact that the exergy of incident solar radiation and electrical exergy in the thermoelectric module are relatively high is due to their low exergy performance in contrast the exergy of evaporative heat transfer on both the glass and the cold thermoelectric surface is small tem with the solar still found an excellent option to provide the potable water along with the

used to identify major source of groundwater 2 regional settings the kuttiyadi river basin is located in the kozhikode district of northern kerala with an area of about 676 km2 and the study area falls between 75 55 east longitudes and from 11 30 to 11 40 north latitude the topographical characteristic is higher towards northeastern and lower towards the northwestern side with significant altitude difference the highest point observed is 1641 m while the lowest point is located at the catchment outlet of the kuttiyadi river at kottakal the kuttiyadi river basin chosen for the present study is broadly classified into three physiographical regions cwrdm 1995 as lowland midland and highland with an elevation of 7 5 m 7 5 75 m and 75 m respectively fig 1 most of the basin is widely distributed by precambrian crystalline rocks which mainly consist of hornblende gneiss of granulite grade metamorphism and the charnockite type rock formation which is widespread mainly in highland

the normal annual rainfall varies from 6148 mm to 3525 mm cgwb 2013 3 materials and methods representative groundwater samples were collected from 13 open wells table 1 and surface water samples collected from 6 locations including river and reservoir water and its geographical location were noted using handheld gps the sampling locations were selected based on representation from the three physiographical zones highland midland and lowland during the premonsoon april and postmonsoon november seasons stable isotope analyses were done using the continuous flow isotope ratio mass

not show any significant spatial and temporal variation fig 3 however small enrichment in groundwater in the postmonsoon season was observed earlier studies have shown that the southwest monsoon in this area is relatively enriched than the northeast monsoon warrier et al 2010 hameed et al 2015 in other river basins of northern kerala such observations were made hameed et al 2016 and was ascribed either due to the relatively lesser contribution of northeast monsoon in replenishing the groundwater in the study area or due to its delay in reaching groundwater otherwise the groundwater in the postmonsoon season would have shown a corresponding depletion similar to ne monsoon samples the argument holds good for the krb also which has similar hydrogeology and altitude variations d excess ranged from 7 48 to 14 42 in groundwater samples and an average d excess value of groundwater samples of pre and postmonsoon is 12 32 and 11 39 respectively the d excess value of most of the samples collected from wells at different depth ranges from 2 23 mbgl to 18 2 mbgl is within 10 15 range fig 4 during both seasons the d excess of the precipitation in the area is also reported to be in the same range hameed et al 2016 indicating modern recharge and lesser infiltration of evaporated surface water to the groundwater system 4 2 stable isotope characteristics of surface water δ18o in surface water samples ranged from 1 91 to 3 87 premonsoon and 2 06 to 3 31 postmonsoon and δd ranged from 5 75 to 21 54 and 7 11 to 15 45 the altitude effect is noticed in the river samples in such a way that during premonsoon δ18o values of river samples showed δ values from 1 91 in lowland to 3 87 in mid land table 1 river 1 and river 2 samples in lowland may have experienced 1 91 pre monsoon and 2 06 postmonsoon influence of marine waters especially in the lean flow summer period fig 5 all the river water samples have enriched δ18o than groundwater samples in both seasons and the effect of increased evaporation may be the reason behind for heavier isotope enrichment however the river samples from midland river 3 and river 4 and reservoir 1sample from highlands showed similar δ18o values during postmonsoon season pointing to the possibility of mixing between the two evaporation occurring in the reservoir water body even during cooler months may be responsible for the enrichment of heavier isotope in the postmonsoon season compared to the premonsoon season the reservoir 2 rs2 sample from an elevation of 650 m fig 5 in highlands showed enrichment of δ18o than sample from reservoir 1at an elevation of 200 m indicating the rate of evaporation occurs in this reservoir 2 kakkayam may be higher compared to reservoir 1 in this study area altitude effect in the groundwater regime is not significant and it highlights the lesser influence of surface water to recharge groundwater system in the case of surface water d excess ranged in between 5 and 10 indicate significant surface evaporation the significant correlation between δ18o and electrical conductivity can highlight the role of evaporative enrichments in regulating stream isotopic and geochemical composition

δd fig 6 most of the groundwater samples falling on the lmwl lines and slope of gwl groundwater line are 6 7 and 6 06 during pre and postmonsoon season respectively which shows a slight deviation from the slope of lmwl slope 7 2 which suggests the meteoric origin for the groundwater mostly and a little contribution from other water bodies temporal variation of isotopic signatures within the southwest monsoon samples of kozhikode were noticed in earlier studies warrier et al 2010 such that in july and august the rain water is enriched average δ18o 2 06 whereas june and september the rains are relatively depleted average δ18o 3 58 the groundwater in the study area appears to group in a narrow range signifying a well mixed system with relatively constant isotopic composition with an average δ18o isotopic value of pre and postmonsoon groundwater samples 3 47 and 3 42 similar to that of southwest monsoon showers of the region therefore major source of moisture from northern indian ocean and arabian sea have significant influence to replenish the groundwater resource of krb all the surface water samples falling below the local meteoric water line during premonsoon and postmonsoon season indicated higher degree of evaporation from the regression plot of δ18o and δd the surface water line swl has the slope of 4 64 and 4 48 fig 7 and shows similar evaporative effect in surface water irrespective of the season covariance of δ18o and electrical conductivity ec fig 8 showed insignificant correlation r2 0 041 furthermore groundwater samples did not show an increase in isotopic enrichment with respect to increase in electrical conductivity indicating that groundwater is not undergoing evaporation and source of ions in groundwater is mineral dissolution from the lithological units of the study area fig 2 for surface water samples ec and δ 18o showed significant correlation r2 0 55 and confirmed evaporative effect on the surface water samples however electrical conductivity was 350 μs cm in groundwater samples and can be classified as type i enrichments of salts are low sarath prasanth et al 2012 and were in desirable limit of drinking water quality based on ec pointing the negligible evaporation of groundwater 4 4 estimation of surface water contribution to groundwater recharge the regression plot of δ18o against δ2h and relationship between electrical conductivity ec and δ18o suggests that surface water contribution to recharge groundwater of the study area is not significant or else groundwater would have isotopic enrichment similar to that of surface water even though to validate the significant meteoric recharge to groundwater and to estimate the percentage contribution of surface water to groundwater in krb the oxygen isotope mass balance method is used contribution from surface water to groundwater δam δ1 δ2 δ1 100 δam mixture of groundwater in the pre monsoon season and river water δ1 δ 18 o of premonsoon groundwater δ2 δ 18 o of river water the estimated river water contribution to groundwater in lowland and midland was found to be 17 14 respectively and in highlands surface water contribution to groundwater was 7 table 2 while considering the two reservoir samples 7 surface water was contributed to groundwater system surface water infiltration is less effective in highly undulating topography because the amount of infiltrating water may be less due to the swift surface runoff and the water get infiltrated under favorable conditions will not get much time to remain in the aquifer for long term 5 conclusions the isotopic characterization of groundwater and surface water of the kuttiyadi river basin showed that seasonal and spatial variations in isotopic compositions are more in surface water than groundwater the average d excess value obtained for ground water in the pre and postmonsoon seasons were similar to south west monsoonal rainfall the regression plot of 18o against δ2h also indicated that recharge source of the groundwater in the basin is mainly precipitation and relatively lesser contribution from the evaporated surface water in addition altitude effect was noticed in surface water of kuttiyadi river basin the correlation between δ18o and electrical conductivity ec of the groundwater showed that the there is no significant evaporation and the source of ions in groundwater can be from mineral dissolution of various lithological units like hornblende biotite gneiss charnockite granite gneiss and laterite the oxygen mass balance method revealed that contribution of surface water to replenish groundwater in the highland midland and lowland zone of krb is 7 14 and 17 respectively even though surface water have less contribution to replenish groundwater resource its protection is warranted in the study area for groundwater resource management as the groundwater resource is predominantly depends on the rainfall occurring in the area

12071,to better assess the groundwater recharge pattern of the kuttiyadi river basin krb situated in northern kerala the oxygen δ18o and hydrogen δd isotopic compositions of river water reservoir water and groundwater were determined isotopic characterization of the waters of the basin showed that river water experienced altitude effect from lowland elevation 7 m to midland elevation 7 75 m and highland elevation 75 m isotopic enrichment of river water near the mouth during premonsoon and post monsoon can be due to the influence of sea water ingress especially during tidal events additionally correlation of 18o and electrical conductivity ec further highlights the role of evaporation in isotopic modification of surface water the regression plot of δ18o and δd of groundwater with lmwl local meteoric water line and surface water samples clearly showed the meteoric origin of groundwater using oxygen isotope mass balance method it is estimated that surface water contribution to groundwater was up to 17 in the lowland physiographic zone and it was up to 14 in the midland zone and only 7 surface water is contributing to groundwater regime in highland zone of the krb this

population belongs to the developing countries like algeria argentina bangladesh brazil chile china ethiopia ghana india iran jordan kenya malawi mexico mongolia nepal norway pakistan sri lanka thailand turkey and vietnam rasool et al 2015 chatterjee et al 2018 abiye and bhattacharya 2019 alcaine et al 2020 mariño et al 2020 most of the people of these countries utilize groundwater extracted from shallow as well as deep tube wells for daily water uses including drinking purpose almost all the published reports concentrate mainly on the individual toxicity of fluoride or arsenic there are very limited studies conducted on their geological co occurrence and associated co exposure impacts lopez et al 2012 brahman et al 2013 rasool et al 2015 kumar et al 2016 the entire mechanisms of concurrent actions of these two elements are still under investigation and many of the previously published reports are contradictory to each other zheng et al 2002 simultaneous presence of these two toxicants in groundwater enhances probability of human health risks through endemic regional chronic hydroarsenicism and or endemic fluorosis either dental or skeletal salgado bustamante et al 2010 alarcon herrera et al 2012 mukherjee and singh 2018 the probable reasons for co occurrence of fluoride and arsenic in groundwater have been globally reported by many researchers the condition of groundwater as well as geology was found to be equally contributed to the co occurrence of fluoride and arsenic kumar et al 2020 the mostly reported reasons for their release are desorption of both the toxicants fluoride and arsenic from iron hydr oxides under alkaline ph kumar et al 2016 qurat ul ain et al 2017 release of arsenic due to reductive hydrolysis in presence of organic matters while evapotranspiration was found to be responsible for fluoride release li et al 2012 patel et al 2019 dissolution of calcium fluoride vis a vis ion exchange reaction with hydroxyl ion releasing fluoride whereas desorptive release of arsenic from hydr oxides under elevated ph condition zhang et al 2003 high alkalinity sometimes coupled with high salinity of groundwater bian et al 2012 qurat ul ain et al 2017 dissolution precipitation of calcium arsenate and fluorite under weak alkaline condition chen et al 2017 coal mining brahman et al 2014 heavy deposition of holocene sediments and severe surface erosion bhuyan and islam 2017 dissolution of volcanic glass in a nahco3 rich environment accompanied by dissolution of calcite alcaine et al 2020 heavy withdrawal of groundwater from an aquifer where magmatic process had earlier concentrated fluoride and arsenic alarcon herrera et al 2012 sulfide mineralization backman et al 1994 etc thus the two most significant geologically important factors for the simultaneous release of both the toxicants are desorption of iron hydr oxides which are common host and geological co occurrence of calcareous and volcanoclastic or nahco3 type mixed sediments especially in arid environments weathering of mica fluorite topaz apatite etc by geological agents suthar et al 2008 along with anthropogenic overuses of groundwater uses of phosphate fertilizers etc epa 1997 induce fluoride toxicity in groundwater presence of high content of arsenic in the ganges meghna brahmaputra delta has been unfolded as one of the worst natural geo environmental disaster of all time roychowdhury et al 2002 chouhan and flora 2010 samal et al 2013 the principal source of arsenic in these aquifers is reported to be the dissolution of iron oxyhydroxides and thus arsenic has been found to be correlated with iron contents of groundwater neidhardt et al 2014 the groundwater contamination scenario with fluoride and arsenic has tremendous repercussion on human health cancers melanosis hyperkeratosis peripheral vascular disease gangrene mottling teeth bone softening arthritis and damage to the nerves ahmed et al 2004 samal et al 2013 there is a comparatively narrow margin between the concentration of fluoride which is beneficial and the content which is detrimental kimambo et al 2019 the extent of human health risk from fluoride and arsenic toxicity has magnified many times due to the transfer of these two toxicants through water soil plant food system into human food chain roychowdhury et al 2008 samal et al 2011 pal et al 2012 chowdhury et al 2018a arsenic a human toxin is not essential for human beings hunter 2008 while consumption of only modest quantity of fluoride 0 5 1 mg l facilitates production and sustainment of human teeth and bones wood 1974 thus dietary intake of crops and vegetables cultivated with high fluoride contaminated or arsenic contaminated groundwater renders additional fluoride or arsenic toxicity burden on human body bhattacharya et al 2010a 2017 chowdhury et al 2018b this dietary exposure onus is especially detrimental in areas where fluoride or arsenic in groundwater is present beyond the world health organization who recommended maximum permissible limits 1 5 and 0 01 mg l for fluoride and arsenic respectively who 2010 the normal excretion of arsenic through urine ranges from 0 005 to 0 04 mg day but when substantial amount of arsenic is absorbed in body a significant amount 50 of arsenic is excreted through urine farmer and johnson 1990 likewise significant positive correlations were reported between groundwater fluoride and urinary fluoride contents rango et al 2017 khanoranga and khalid 2019 generally 90 95 of the absorbed fluoride gets accumulated in bones and teeth and the rest is excreted slowly through urine and faces zheng et al 2002 thus total urinary arsenic content as well as urinary fluoride content in human beings has been established as biomarkers for the assessment of arsenic uchino et al 2006 sun bae et al 2013 and fluoride exposures zheng et al 2002 limeback and robinson 2012 rango et al 2014 the present study was conducted in the dharmanagar region of north tripura in the study area groundwater is mostly used as drinking water since in most parts the supply of centralized treated drinking water facility is inadequate two doctors of our research team had recently diagnosed some dental fluorosis cases in children of the area in contrast to arsenic information on the distribution of fluoride in groundwater of the seven north eastern states of india is very much inadequate geographically tripura state of india is surrounded in three sides by bangladesh where groundwater arsenic contamination is a major problem therefore presence of considerable amounts of arsenic along with iron in groundwater of the alluvial aquifers of tripura cannot be ruled out singh 2004 moreover the remaining side of tripura is surrounded by two other north eastern hilly states of india assam and mizoram where groundwater is reported to be contaminated with fluoride kumar et al 2016 hence there is high chance of co occurrence of fluoride and arsenic in the groundwater of dharmanagar region thus the main objectives of the present survey were evaluation of the presence and possible linkage between fluoride and arsenic contents in the groundwater of the dharmanagar area and evaluation of the health risks from drinking water that are borne by the people of the study area through the determination of the estimated daily intake edi and hazard index hi values as an index of monitoring urinary fluoride and urinary arsenic contents of the people of the study area were also estimated in an attempt to understand the level of retention of fluoride and arsenic in human body after their urinary excretion 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sampling locations the dharmanagar town of north tripura district is a synclinal valley which is geographically located at 24 22 42 7 n latitude and 92 10 41 9 e longitude stretching approximately 10 7 km2 area with 21 m average elevation according to the last census the population of the region is 40 595 census 2011 the dharmanagar valley is mainly composed of thick sandstone horizons with thin intervening shale clay horizons the general slope of the valley is towards the north all the rivers of the district being rain fed are ephemeral in nature the major rivers in the area are juri and kakri geologically governed drainage pattern of the rivers is primarily trellis with a few instances of dendrite pattern the drainage system of the region forms a major part of the barak sub basin which in turn forms a part of the meghna basin low amount of fluoride 0 03 0 39 mg l not exceeding the who recommended maximum limit in shallow as well as deep aquifers of north tripura had been reported central ground water board 2012 while in a separate study the tripura state pollution control board tspcb did not detect any arsenic contamination in the groundwater samples of the dharmanagar region tspcb 2005 the observed range of iron in groundwater samples of north tripura was 0 48 1 mg l tspcb 2005 the sampling locations of the present study have been indicated in fig 1 in absence of municipality treated drinking water supply facility in the study area groundwater is mostly utilized as the source of drinking water by the local people moreover shallow and deep tube well pumps are used for irrigation in the months other than the rainy season 2 2 sample collection processing and preservation a total of 71 groundwater samples were randomly collected from the dharmanagar region during march 2018 following the standard water sampling techniques a global positioning system gps device garmin etrex 10 was used for mapping the sampling locations the samples were collected 500 m away from each other sampling points the bottles used for sampling were soaked in 1 1 hcl for a whole day then distilled water was used to wash them and were finally rinsed with the filtrates of the sample prior to each sampling during collection the shallow and deep tube wells were kept running for 10 15 min for getting electrically stable samples bhattacharya et al 2010a 2010b groundwater samples were collected using pre cleaned polyethylene bottles 50 ml capacity to analyze fluoride and iron contents for analysis of arsenic another set of pre cleaned 50 ml polyethylene bottles were used to collect the groundwater samples then the samples were filtered using 0 45 μ millipore filter paper and the filtrates were preserved with concentrated hno3 to maintain ph at 2 finally the samples were kept at 4 c we categorized the studied population among three age subgroups children 3 6 years teenagers 7 18 years and adults 19 70 years the selected individuals were born and resident of the area under study since their birth prior consents were taken from the participants or their parents in case of minor the first morning spot urine samples were collected in 100 ml sterilized polythene bottles from the people living in the study area to analyze urinary fluoride and urinary arsenic contents das and mondal 2016 no further chemical treatment was carried out to the urine samples uchino et al 2006 after collection the samples were stored under refrigeration till analyses were accomplished thorough care was taken in every step to avoid any contamination any medicine or injection or chemical were not applied to the human subjects in studying their symptoms of fluoride and arsenic toxicity the present study complies with the standard criteria set for the ethical treatment of human subjects proper measures have been taken in ensuring individual rights and confidentiality of the selected human subjects 2 3 sample analysis fluoride and arsenic in groundwater and urine samples were determined directly without any digestion the total fluoride content in the collected groundwater and urine samples was determined using a ph ion selective electrode bench top meter thermo scientific vstar40a orion versa star the detailed standardization and analysis methods of fluoride using orion ise 9609bnwp and 960900 fluoride combination electrodes and tisab iii orion have been described in our previous publications samal et al 2015 bhattacharya et al 2017 the detection limit of fluoride for this method is 0 005 mg l the total arsenic contents in the collected groundwater and urine samples were determined using a varian model aa 140 aas usa the detailed instrumentation optimization conditions and methodology of the fi hg aas system were reported earlier chowdhury et al 2018a the detection limit of arsenic for this method is 0 003 mg l total iron in groundwater samples was estimated spectrophotometrically utilizing the phenanthroline method having detection limit of 0 01 mg l saywell and cunningham 1937 all the analyses were executed in triplicate and the obtained results were reproducible with 2 error 2 4 assessment of the doses of fluoride and arsenic exposures and risk characterization from the exposures

the study area the alluvial flood plains of the rivers ganges and brahmaputra have long been established to be contaminated with arsenic das et al 2009 bhattacharya et al 2010a b bhattacharya et al 2013 goswami et al 2014 patel et al 2017 and fluoride sankararamakrishnan et al 2008 samal et al 2015 kumar et al 2016 ali et al 2019 many times higher than the who recommended values with large number of exposed individuals the concentrations of fluoride arsenic and iron in the collected groundwater samples from different mauzas of dharmanagar region have been shown in table 1 the average concentration of fluoride arsenic and iron was found to be 1 8 0 012 and 2 4 mg l respectively co occurrence of fluoride and arsenic was observed in 59 of the analyzed samples the results depict that 43 of the total analyzed samples has fluoride level 1 5 mg l which is the who drinking water standard while arsenic content exceeded its who limit 0 01 mg l in case of 36 samples simultaneous breaching of the respective who standards was observed in 21 out of total 71 samples 30 mostly in the groundwater samples collected from baghan premtala and jherjeri mauzas of dharmanagar region on contrary to the findings by farooqi et al 2007 and kumar et al 2016 in their respective studies conducted in punjab pakistan and assam india the fluoride contents in groundwater of the study area were found to be significantly correlated r 0 6 with the arsenic contents fig 2 a this suggests that the co occurrence of fluoride and arsenic in dharmanagar region is quite probably due to their identical geogenic release into the environment bhattacharya et al 1997 jacks et al 2005 kumar et al 2016 ahmad and bhattacharya 2019 ahmad et al 2020 alcaine et al 2020 a trend of two potential exponential relations between fluoride and arsenic could be seen in the groundwater of the study area fig 2a kumar et al 2017 proposed that iron hydr oxides has the potential to play the major role in co occurrence of fluoride and arsenic with two sorption coefficients the dissolution precipitation of fluorite or mica and release of arsenic adsorbed on fe mn oxides hydroxides or calcium arsenate in slightly alkaline environment was found to be responsible for co occurrence of fluoride and arsenic in different regions of china chen et al 2017 luo et al 2018 similar association of fluoride and arsenic was also observed in areas of pakistan brahman et al 2013 rasool et al 2015 ain et al 2017 rashid et al 2018 and nepal mueller 2017 rajmohan et al 2017 this observation is of deep concern the significant correlation between the two toxicants means that when one of them is present in groundwater the other is also most likely to be present the maximum concentration of fluoride and arsenic in the studied samples was evaluated to be 4 8 mg l in premtala mauza and 0 044 mg l in jherjeri mauza respectively the spatial variation of fluoride and arsenic concentrations in groundwater of the studied region is shown in fig 2b the figure quite clearly demonstrates the co occurrence of fluoride and arsenic in north tripura the study area is a synclinal valley located between sanicherra hill in the east and unakoti hill in the west the general slope of the valley being towards the north the concentration contours of fluoride as well as arsenic in fig 2b were found to be condensed in the northern parts of the study area which is possibly due to the maximum leaching of fluoride and arsenic bearing minerals immediate strict action should be taken so that the groundwater of baghan premtala lakshminagar phulbari and jherjeri mauzas is avoided for drinking purpose intake of groundwater in those areas would result tooth discoloration bone deformation neurological reproductive gastrointestinal renal problems and different degrees of arsenicosis in people especially children salgado bustamante et al 2010 ali et al 2018 bhattacharya and samal 2018 very meager correlation was observed between iron and fluoride contents r 0 17 and also between iron and arsenic contents r 0 12 in groundwater of dharmanagar region during our study we found that 25 of houses in the study area were withdrawing groundwater from shallow aquifers 20 27 m and the rest was utilizing water from middle depth or deeper aquifers 37 122 m the relationship among the depth of the aquifers with the fluoride and arsenic contents in groundwater of dharmanagar region is shown in fig 3 it is evident from the figure that irrespective of depth both shallow as well as deep aquifers of the dharmanagar region have been contaminated by fluoride and arsenic specifically the shallow aquifer at 20 27 m depth the middle depth aquifer at 37 61 m and the deeper aquifers situated at 110 122 m were all observed to be contaminated by these two toxicants to the highest degrees in some earlier studies only the shallow aquifers of pakistan and nepal were reported to be predominantly polluted with fluoride and arsenic farooqi et al 2007 rajmohan et al 2017 but in the present study it can be said that merely drilling the deeper aquifers to access uncontaminated groundwater for drinking will not be an efficient management strategy 3 2 evaluation of the doses of fluoride and arsenic exposures and characterization of risk the doses of fluoride and arsenic exposures in the residents of dharmanagar region due to the consumption of fluoride and arsenic contaminated drinking water were evaluated using the usepa s generic equation for the estimated daily intake edi usepa 1992 further to characterize complete risk potential in the study area the edi was calculated for two exposure situations the central tendency exposure cte was computed using the observed average values of fluoride 1 8 mg l and arsenic 0 012 mg l in drinking water and the reasonable maximum exposure rme was computed employing the 90th percentile values of the observed fluoride 3 4 mg l and arsenic 0 028 mg l concentrations the rme value is the representation of the high end exposure usepa 1992 the evaluated edis for the cte and rme scenarios among the three different age groups of people living in the dharmanagar region are shown in table 2 the results demonstrate that the cumulative edi edi cumulative due to the consumption of fluoride and arsenic contaminated drinking water in the cte scenario is the maximum in case of children 0 101 mg kg day followed by adults 0 091 mg kg day and teenagers 0 07 mg kg day for the rme scenario the calculated edi cumulative was observed to be identical 0 182 mg kg day for children and adults of the study area the teenagers were found to be the least affected 0 131 mg kg day among the three age groups the segregated contributions of fluoride intake to the edi cumulative for the studied population were evaluated to be 97 99 for the cte scenario and 98 99 for the rme scenario respectively the tolerable upper intake level ul value for arsenic 0 0021 mg kg day was withdrawn due to the increased incidences of arsenic related cancers who 2010 but it is alarming to find that the edi fluoride for the children in the current study equalized with the recommended ul value for fluoride 0 1 mg kg day iom 1997 in the cte scenario and exceeded the ul value in the rme scenario table 2 the edi fluoride values of teenagers for the two calculated exposure situations and that of adults only in the cte scenario were observed to be within their recommended ul value 0 15 0 2 mg kg day iom 1997 higher edi cumulative values 0 26 1 5 mg kg day were reported from two similar co occurrence of fluoride and arsenic studies conducted in pakistan brahman et al 2014 rasool et al 2015 as compared to the present study 0 07 0 18 mg kg day the quantification of risk for the consumption of contaminated groundwater is an important task in india as nationwide monitoring of the quality of groundwater is extremely inadequate in the country for studying human health risks the hazard index hi values due to the consumption of fluoride and arsenic contaminated drinking water were calculated for the children teenagers and adults residing in the dharmanagar region table 2 in the cte the hi fluoride had a range of 1 2 1 7 in the different age groups and the range of hi arsenic was observed to be even higher 1 5 2 1 in the worst possible rme scenario the hi fluoride and the hi arsenic were projected in the range 2 2 3 and 3 7 5 respectively according to the canada health act annual report 2004 immediate and decisive human health risk mitigation steps are necessitated in the toxic exposure cases with hi values greater than unity the combined exposure to hazard by the children teenagers and adults in the cte and rme conditions due to the co occurrence of fluoride and arsenic in groundwater are represented in fig 4 thus all the obtained unacceptable hi values 1 in the current study definitely reconfirmed the severity of the groundwater pollution situation in the dharmanagar region moreover among the three age subgroups the hi fluoride was the highest in case of children hence children of the studied locations are under serious risk in developing dental fluorosis fig 5 shows a case of dental fluorosis of a 7 year old child residing in premtala mauza average fluoride content in groundwater 4 2 1 3 mg l urinary fluoride content of the child 9 7 mg l the cumulative noncancerous lifetime hazard index hi cumulative conveys the noncancerous risk to a population for lifelong toxic exposure scenario here the hi cumulative was evaluated for simultaneous fluoride and arsenic exposure conditions and the exposure time period was considered to be 3 70 years the estimated hi cumulative in the cte and rme scenarios was 10 and 22 respectively table 2 the greater the hi cumulative value the greater is the risk of developing severe chronic toxicity of fluoride and arsenic among people the poor socioeconomical condition scarcity of proper healthcare facility malnutrition etc in addition to the considerable groundwater pollution may have synergistic effects on the health of people brahman et al 2014 the obtained results are thus highly distressing alarming and inevitably demand prompt attention and mitigation consumption of fluoride or arsenic contaminated drinking water was long established as the primary pathway of exposure to human beings ohno et al 2007 bhattacharya et al 2017 according to some reports further accumulation of fluoride and arsenic in rice pulses vegetables meat and tea through water soil plant animal transport mechanism and their subsequent consumption would cause even higher threats to human health ullah et al 2017 3 3 assessment of the retention of fluoride and arsenic among people after their urinary excretion the absorption and excretion of fluoride and arsenic in body are governed by different metabolic processes zheng et al 2002 after dietary intake of fluoride and arsenic in human beings their urinary excretion is the most favorable route for their removal from body rango et al 2014 thus the urinary fluoride and urinary arsenic contents were determined in 100 samples for the assessment of the retention of fluoride and arsenic in residents of the study area table 3 the resulted data showed the presence of alarmingly high content of urinary fluoride average concentration 3 1 1 2 mg l in children teenagers and adults of the dharmanagar region in other studies on indian population fluoride in urine samples was reported in the range of 0 1 17 mg l when fluoride concentrations in drinking water were 1 6 3 3 mg l singh et al 2007 das and mondal 2016 kumar et al 2017 similar observations of higher urinary fluoride contents as compared to the concentration of fluoride in drinking water were also made by xiang et al 2003 rango et al 2014 and carmen et al 2016 in their respective studies conducted in chinese ethiopian and mexican children the urinary fluoride contents in the population under investigation were found to be positively correlated r 0 46 with the groundwater fluoride contents fig 6 a this finding is in agreement with earlier reports rango et al 2017 khanoranga and khalid 2019 moreover the urinary fluoride contents were estimated to be 65 163 of the total fluoride intake 1 9 7 2 mg day thus it is evident that the residents were exposed to fluoride from other sources in addition to our studied drinking water pathway these sources may be dietary intakes of rice pulses fruits vegetables and tea cultivated with the fluoride contaminated groundwater bhattacharya et al 2017 as well as may be uses of fluoridated toothpastes or tobacco products khanoranga and khalid 2019 and also may be the consumption of milk and meat international programme on chemical safety ipcs 2002 in some of the previously conducted studies on fluorosis severity especially dental fluorosis in children was shown to be positively correlated with high urinary fluoride contents jarquín yañez et al 2015 carmen et al 2016 the urinary arsenic levels of the studied population 0 005 0 008 mg day were found to be within the normal level of arsenic in urine of human beings 0 005 0 04 mg day urinary arsenic of the population under study was observed to be significantly correlated r 0 69 with the groundwater arsenic contents fig 6b this finding is concurrent with the previous reported observations by uchino et al 2006 and sun bae et al 2013 the retention of arsenic in the studied population was found to be 58 83 of the total arsenic intakes 0 012 0 048 mg day in some studies arsenic was reported to be more capable of accumulating in human body with respect to fluoride zheng et al 2002 sun bae et al 2013 hence urinary contents of fluoride and arsenic can be well utilized to understand the retention of these two toxicants in the studied population 4 conclusions both fluoride and arsenic is significantly responsible for worldwide groundwater pollution phenomenon and related deteriorated public health issues the present study was thus conducted to analyze co occurrence of fluoride and arsenic in groundwater of the dharmanagar region north tripura india the results clearly showed that on contrary to only shallow aquifer contamination by fluoride and arsenic reports from pakistan and nepal the shallow moderately deep as well as deeper aquifers of the study area have all been contaminated by these two toxicants the average fluoride content 1 8 0 9 mg l and average arsenic content 0 012 0 005 mg l therefore the groundwater is completely unsafe for consumption in the studied areas with respect to these two toxicants the significant association observed between fluoride and arsenic contents in groundwater r 0 6 implies that when one of these toxicants is found in any groundwater of north tripura the sample should be immediately analyzed to determine the presence of the other toxicant similar correlation between fluoride and arsenic contents in groundwater was earlier reported from studies conducted in china pakistan and india but both the toxicants showed poor association with iron contents in groundwater of the study area all the hazard indices calculated for the population living in the dharmanagar region were 1 and thus the entire population is at risk from fluorosis and arsenicosis periodic medical camps should be conducted to diagnose dental fluorosis among children at an early stage since the incidence of dental fluorosis is expected to rise with time the computed edi fluoride for the children 0 1 mg kg day the observed urinary fluoride and urinary arsenic contents in the studied population reflected the degree of fluoride and arsenic consumption the calculated edi cumulative values 0 07 0 18 mg kg day in the present study were although found to be far lower than the previously reported values from pakistan by brahman et al 2014 and rasool et al 2015 but the presence of high content of urinary fluoride 3 1 4 7 mg day suggested that the residents of the study area were exposed to fluoride from other sources in addition to the drinking water pathway further study is underway to detect the transport of fluoride and arsenic in rice fruit vegetable and tea samples cultivated utilizing the contaminated groundwater of the study area arsenic concentrations in urine 0 005 0 008 mg day did not exceed the permissible urinary arsenic limits water is a scarce resource in north tripura thus the situation necessitates continuous and rigorous drinking water quality monitoring for its sustainable management additionally immediate effective strategies should be taken by the government to supply safe drinking water from centralized treatment facilities declaration of competing interest the

12073,the present study assessed the co occurrence of fluoride and arsenic in groundwater of dharmanagar region tripura india co occurrence of the two toxicants was observed in 59 of the analyzed groundwater samples n 71 out of which concentrations of both the toxicants exceeded the world health organization drinking water standards in 30 samples significant positive correlation r 0 6 was observed between groundwater fluoride 0 005 4 8 mg l and arsenic 0 003 0 044 mg l contents the range of cumulative estimated daily intakes edi in the studied population was 0 07 0 1 and 0 13 0 18 mg kg day for the central tendency exposure cte and the reasonable maximum exposure rme scenarios respectively the edi fluoride for the children of the study area was already found to reach the tolerable upper intake level ul value 0 1 mg kg day and the children are thus at high risk from developing dental fluorosis irrespective of the cte or rme scenario the hazard index of fluoride hi fluoride 1 2 3 and that of arsenic hi arsenic 1 5 5 were always found to be unsafe hi 1 in the studied population the estimated cumulative noncancerous lifetime hazard index for simultaneous fluoride and arsenic exposures was calculated to be prominently high 10 and 22 for the cte and rme scenarios respectively the average urinary fluoride and arsenic contents of the studied population was observed to be correlated r 0 46 and 0 69 with the groundwater fluoride and arsenic concentrations respectively the observed content of urinary fluoride mean 3 1 1 2 mg l of the studied population was determined to be 65 163 of their total fluoride intakes 1 9 7 2 mg day the obtained results are highly alarming and thus for reducing threats to human health the government should immediately take necessary action

toxicants in groundwater enhances probability of human health risks through endemic regional chronic hydroarsenicism and or endemic fluorosis either dental or skeletal salgado bustamante et al 2010 alarcon herrera et al 2012 mukherjee and singh 2018 the probable reasons for co occurrence of fluoride and arsenic in groundwater have been globally reported by many researchers the condition of groundwater as well as geology was found to be equally contributed to the co occurrence of fluoride and arsenic kumar et al 2020 the mostly reported reasons for their release are desorption of both the toxicants fluoride and arsenic from iron hydr oxides under alkaline ph kumar et al 2016 qurat ul ain et al 2017 release of arsenic due to reductive hydrolysis in presence of organic matters while evapotranspiration was found to be responsible for fluoride release li et al 2012 patel et al 2019 dissolution of calcium fluoride vis a vis ion exchange reaction with hydroxyl ion releasing fluoride whereas desorptive release of arsenic from hydr oxides under elevated ph condition zhang et al 2003 high alkalinity sometimes coupled with high salinity of groundwater bian et al 2012 qurat ul ain et al 2017 dissolution precipitation of calcium arsenate and fluorite under weak alkaline condition chen et al 2017 coal mining brahman et al 2014 heavy deposition of holocene sediments and severe surface erosion bhuyan and islam 2017 dissolution of volcanic glass in a nahco3 rich environment accompanied by dissolution of calcite alcaine et al 2020 heavy withdrawal of groundwater from an aquifer where magmatic process had earlier concentrated fluoride and arsenic alarcon herrera et al 2012 sulfide mineralization backman et al 1994 etc thus the two most significant geologically important factors for the simultaneous release of both the toxicants are desorption of iron hydr oxides which are common host and geological co occurrence of calcareous and volcanoclastic or nahco3 type mixed sediments especially in arid environments weathering of mica fluorite topaz apatite etc by geological agents suthar et al 2008 along with anthropogenic overuses of groundwater uses of phosphate fertilizers etc epa 1997 induce fluoride toxicity in groundwater presence of high content of arsenic in the ganges meghna brahmaputra delta has been unfolded as one of the worst natural geo environmental disaster of all time roychowdhury et al 2002 chouhan and flora 2010 samal et al 2013 the principal source of arsenic in these aquifers is reported to be the dissolution of iron oxyhydroxides and thus arsenic has been found to be correlated with iron contents of groundwater neidhardt et al 2014 the groundwater contamination scenario with fluoride and arsenic has tremendous repercussion on human health cancers melanosis hyperkeratosis peripheral vascular disease gangrene mottling teeth bone softening arthritis and damage to the nerves ahmed et al 2004 samal et al 2013 there is a comparatively narrow margin between the concentration of fluoride which is beneficial and the content which is detrimental kimambo et al 2019 the extent of human health risk from fluoride and arsenic toxicity has magnified many times due to the transfer of these two toxicants through water soil plant food system into human food chain roychowdhury et al 2008 samal et al 2011 pal et al 2012 chowdhury et al 2018a arsenic a human toxin is not essential for human beings hunter 2008 while consumption of only modest quantity of fluoride 0 5 1 mg l facilitates production and sustainment of human teeth and bones wood 1974 thus dietary intake of crops and vegetables cultivated with high fluoride contaminated or arsenic contaminated groundwater renders additional fluoride or arsenic toxicity burden on human body bhattacharya et al 2010a 2017 chowdhury et al 2018b this dietary exposure onus is especially detrimental in areas where fluoride or arsenic in groundwater is present beyond the world health organization who recommended maximum permissible limits 1 5 and 0 01 mg l for fluoride and arsenic respectively who 2010 the normal excretion of arsenic through urine ranges from 0 005 to 0 04 mg day but when substantial amount of arsenic is absorbed in body a significant amount 50 of arsenic is excreted through urine farmer and johnson 1990 likewise significant positive correlations were reported between groundwater fluoride and urinary fluoride contents rango et al 2017 khanoranga and khalid 2019 generally 90 95 of the absorbed fluoride gets accumulated in bones and teeth and the rest is excreted slowly through urine and faces zheng et al 2002 thus total urinary arsenic content as well as urinary fluoride content in human beings has been established as biomarkers for the assessment of arsenic uchino et al 2006 sun bae et al 2013 and fluoride exposures zheng et al 2002 limeback and robinson 2012 rango et al 2014 the present study was conducted in the dharmanagar region of north tripura in the study area groundwater is mostly used as drinking water since in most parts the supply of centralized treated drinking water facility is inadequate two doctors of our research team had recently diagnosed some dental fluorosis cases in children of the area in contrast to arsenic information on the distribution of fluoride in groundwater of the seven north eastern states of india is very much inadequate geographically tripura state of india is surrounded in three sides by bangladesh where groundwater arsenic contamination is a major problem therefore presence of considerable amounts of arsenic along with iron in groundwater of the alluvial aquifers of tripura cannot be ruled out singh 2004 moreover the remaining side of tripura is surrounded by two other north eastern hilly states of india assam and mizoram where groundwater is reported to be contaminated with fluoride kumar et al 2016 hence there is high chance of co occurrence of fluoride and arsenic in the groundwater of dharmanagar region thus the main objectives of the present survey were evaluation of the presence and possible linkage between fluoride and arsenic contents in the groundwater of the dharmanagar area and evaluation of the health risks from drinking water that are borne by the people of the study area through the determination of the estimated daily intake edi and hazard index hi values as an index of monitoring urinary fluoride and urinary arsenic contents of the people of the study area were also estimated in an attempt to understand the level of retention of fluoride and arsenic in human body after their urinary excretion 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sampling locations the dharmanagar town of north tripura district is a synclinal valley which is geographically located at 24 22 42 7 n latitude and 92 10 41 9 e longitude stretching approximately 10 7 km2 area with 21 m average elevation according to the last census the population of the region is 40 595 census 2011 the dharmanagar valley is mainly composed of thick sandstone horizons with thin intervening shale clay horizons the general slope of the valley is towards the north all the rivers of the district being rain fed are ephemeral in nature the major rivers in the area are juri and kakri geologically governed drainage pattern of the rivers is primarily trellis with a few instances of dendrite pattern the drainage system of the region forms a major part of the barak sub basin which in turn forms a part of the meghna basin low amount of fluoride 0 03 0 39 mg l not exceeding the who recommended maximum limit in shallow as well as deep aquifers of north tripura had been reported central ground water board 2012 while in a separate study the tripura state pollution control board tspcb did not detect any arsenic contamination in the groundwater samples of the dharmanagar region tspcb 2005 the observed range of iron in groundwater samples of north tripura was 0 48 1 mg l tspcb 2005 the sampling locations of the present study have been indicated in fig 1 in absence of municipality treated drinking water supply facility in the study area groundwater is mostly utilized as the source of drinking water by the local people moreover shallow and deep tube well pumps are used for irrigation in the months other than the rainy season 2 2 sample collection processing and preservation a total of 71 groundwater samples were randomly collected from the dharmanagar region during march 2018 following the standard water sampling techniques a global positioning system gps device garmin etrex 10 was used for mapping the sampling locations the samples were collected 500 m away from each other sampling points the bottles used for sampling were soaked in 1 1 hcl for a whole day then distilled water was used to wash them and were finally rinsed with the filtrates of the sample prior to each sampling during collection the shallow and deep tube wells were kept running for 10 15 min for getting electrically stable samples bhattacharya et al 2010a 2010b groundwater samples were collected using pre cleaned polyethylene bottles 50 ml capacity to analyze fluoride and iron contents for analysis of arsenic another set of pre cleaned 50 ml polyethylene bottles were used to collect the groundwater samples then the samples were filtered using 0 45 μ millipore filter paper and the filtrates were preserved with concentrated hno3 to maintain ph at 2 finally the samples were kept at 4 c we categorized the studied population among three age subgroups children 3 6 years teenagers 7 18 years and adults 19 70 years the selected individuals were born and resident of the area under study since their birth prior consents were taken from the participants or their parents in case of minor the first morning spot urine samples were collected in 100 ml sterilized polythene bottles from the people living in the study area to analyze urinary fluoride and urinary arsenic contents das and mondal 2016 no further chemical treatment was carried out to the urine samples uchino et al 2006 after collection the samples were stored under refrigeration till analyses were accomplished thorough care was taken in every step to avoid any contamination any medicine or injection or chemical were not applied to the human subjects in studying their symptoms of fluoride and arsenic toxicity the present study complies with the standard criteria set for the ethical treatment of human subjects proper measures have been taken in ensuring individual rights and confidentiality of the selected human subjects 2 3 sample analysis fluoride and arsenic in groundwater and urine samples were determined directly without any digestion the total fluoride content in the collected groundwater and urine samples was determined using a ph ion selective electrode bench top meter thermo scientific vstar40a orion versa star the detailed standardization and analysis methods of fluoride using orion ise 9609bnwp and 960900 fluoride combination electrodes and tisab iii orion have been described in our previous publications samal et al 2015 bhattacharya et al 2017 the detection limit of fluoride for this method is 0 005 mg l the total arsenic contents in the collected groundwater and urine samples were determined using a varian model aa 140 aas usa the detailed instrumentation optimization conditions and methodology of the fi hg aas system were reported earlier chowdhury et al 2018a the detection limit of arsenic for this method is 0 003 mg l total iron in groundwater samples was estimated spectrophotometrically utilizing the phenanthroline method having detection limit of 0 01 mg l saywell and cunningham 1937 all the analyses were executed in triplicate and the obtained results were reproducible with 2 error 2 4 assessment of the doses of fluoride and arsenic exposures and risk characterization from the exposures

the study area the alluvial flood plains of the rivers ganges and brahmaputra have long been established to be contaminated with arsenic das et al 2009 bhattacharya et al 2010a b bhattacharya et al 2013 goswami et al 2014 patel et al 2017 and fluoride sankararamakrishnan et al 2008 samal et al 2015 kumar et al 2016 ali et al 2019 many times higher than the who recommended values with large number of exposed individuals the concentrations of fluoride arsenic and iron in the collected groundwater samples from different mauzas of dharmanagar region have been shown in table 1 the average concentration of fluoride arsenic and iron was found to be 1 8 0 012 and 2 4 mg l respectively co occurrence of fluoride and arsenic was observed in 59 of the analyzed samples the results depict that 43 of the total analyzed samples has fluoride level 1 5 mg l which is the who drinking water standard while arsenic content exceeded its who limit 0 01 mg l in case of 36 samples simultaneous breaching of the respective who standards was observed in 21 out of total 71 samples 30 mostly in the groundwater samples collected from baghan premtala and jherjeri mauzas of dharmanagar region on contrary to the findings by farooqi et al 2007 and kumar et al 2016 in their respective studies conducted in punjab pakistan and assam india the fluoride contents in groundwater of the study area were found to be significantly correlated r 0 6 with the arsenic contents fig 2 a this suggests that the co occurrence of fluoride and arsenic in dharmanagar region is quite probably due to their identical geogenic release into the environment bhattacharya et al 1997 jacks et al 2005 kumar et al 2016 ahmad and bhattacharya 2019 ahmad et al 2020 alcaine et al 2020 a trend of two potential exponential relations between fluoride and arsenic could be seen in the groundwater of the study area fig 2a kumar et al 2017 proposed that iron hydr oxides has the potential to play the major role in co occurrence of fluoride and arsenic with two sorption coefficients the dissolution precipitation of fluorite or mica and release of arsenic adsorbed on fe mn oxides hydroxides or calcium arsenate in slightly alkaline environment was found to be responsible for co occurrence of fluoride and arsenic in different regions of china chen et al 2017 luo et al 2018 similar association of fluoride and arsenic was also observed in areas of pakistan brahman et al 2013 rasool et al 2015 ain et al 2017 rashid et al 2018 and nepal mueller 2017 rajmohan et al 2017 this observation is of deep concern the significant correlation between the two toxicants means that when one of them is present in groundwater the other is also most likely to be present the maximum concentration of fluoride and arsenic in the studied samples was evaluated to be 4 8 mg l in premtala mauza and 0 044 mg l in jherjeri mauza respectively the spatial variation of fluoride and arsenic concentrations in groundwater of the studied region is shown in fig 2b the figure quite clearly demonstrates the co occurrence of fluoride and arsenic in north tripura the study area is a synclinal valley located between sanicherra hill in the east and unakoti hill in the west the general slope of the valley being towards the north the concentration contours of fluoride as well as arsenic in fig 2b were found to be condensed in the northern parts of the study area which is possibly due to the maximum leaching of fluoride and arsenic bearing minerals immediate strict action should be taken so that the groundwater of baghan premtala lakshminagar phulbari and jherjeri mauzas is avoided for drinking purpose intake of groundwater in those areas would result tooth discoloration bone deformation neurological reproductive gastrointestinal renal problems and different degrees of arsenicosis in people especially children salgado bustamante et al 2010 ali et al 2018 bhattacharya and samal 2018 very meager correlation was observed between iron and fluoride contents r 0 17 and also between iron and arsenic contents r 0 12 in groundwater of dharmanagar region during our study we found that 25 of houses in the study area were withdrawing groundwater from shallow aquifers 20 27 m and the rest was utilizing water from middle depth or deeper aquifers 37 122 m the relationship among the depth of the aquifers with the fluoride and arsenic contents in groundwater of dharmanagar region is shown in fig 3 it is evident from the figure that irrespective of depth both shallow as well as deep aquifers of the dharmanagar region have been contaminated by fluoride and arsenic specifically the shallow aquifer at 20 27 m depth the middle depth aquifer at 37 61 m and the deeper aquifers situated at 110 122 m were all observed to be contaminated by these two toxicants to the highest degrees in some earlier studies only the shallow aquifers of pakistan and nepal were reported to be predominantly polluted with fluoride and arsenic farooqi et al 2007 rajmohan et al 2017 but in the present study it can be said that merely drilling the deeper aquifers to access uncontaminated groundwater for drinking will not be an efficient management strategy 3 2 evaluation of the doses of fluoride and arsenic exposures and characterization of risk the doses of fluoride and arsenic exposures in the residents of dharmanagar region due to the consumption of fluoride and arsenic contaminated drinking water were evaluated using the usepa s generic equation for the estimated daily intake edi usepa 1992 further to characterize complete risk potential in the study area the edi was calculated for two exposure situations the central tendency exposure cte was computed using the observed average values of fluoride 1 8 mg l and arsenic 0 012 mg l in drinking water and the reasonable maximum exposure rme was computed employing the 90th percentile values of the observed fluoride 3 4 mg l and arsenic 0 028 mg l concentrations the rme value is the representation of the high end exposure usepa 1992 the evaluated edis for the cte and rme scenarios among the three different age groups of people living in the dharmanagar region are shown in table 2 the results demonstrate that the cumulative edi edi cumulative due to the consumption of fluoride and arsenic contaminated drinking water in the cte scenario is the maximum in case of children 0 101 mg kg day followed by adults 0 091 mg kg day and teenagers 0 07 mg kg day for the rme scenario the calculated edi cumulative was observed to be identical 0 182 mg kg day for children and adults of the study area the teenagers were found to be the least affected 0 131 mg kg day among the three age groups the segregated contributions of fluoride intake to the edi cumulative for the studied population were evaluated to be 97 99 for the cte scenario and 98 99 for the rme scenario respectively the tolerable upper intake level ul value for arsenic 0 0021 mg kg day was withdrawn due to the increased incidences of arsenic related cancers who 2010 but it is alarming to find that the edi fluoride for the children in the current study equalized with the recommended ul value for fluoride 0 1 mg kg day iom 1997 in the cte scenario and exceeded the ul value in the rme scenario table 2 the edi fluoride values of teenagers for the two calculated exposure situations and that of adults only in the cte scenario were observed to be within their recommended ul value 0 15 0 2 mg kg day iom 1997 higher edi cumulative values 0 26 1 5 mg kg day were reported from two similar co occurrence of fluoride and arsenic studies conducted in pakistan brahman et al 2014 rasool et al 2015 as compared to the present study 0 07 0 18 mg kg day the quantification of risk for the consumption of contaminated groundwater is an important task in india as nationwide monitoring of the quality of groundwater is extremely inadequate in the country for studying human health risks the hazard index hi values due to the consumption of fluoride and arsenic contaminated drinking water were calculated for the children teenagers and adults residing in the dharmanagar region table 2 in the cte the hi fluoride had a range of 1 2 1 7 in the different age groups and the range of hi arsenic was observed to be even higher 1 5 2 1 in the worst possible rme scenario the hi fluoride and the hi arsenic were projected in the range 2 2 3 and 3 7 5 respectively according to the canada health act annual report 2004 immediate and decisive human health risk mitigation steps are necessitated in the toxic exposure cases with hi values greater than unity the combined exposure to hazard by the children teenagers and adults in the cte and rme conditions due to the co occurrence of fluoride and arsenic in groundwater are represented in fig 4 thus all the obtained unacceptable hi values 1 in the current study definitely reconfirmed the severity of the groundwater pollution situation in the dharmanagar region moreover among the three age subgroups the hi fluoride was the highest in case of children hence children of the studied locations are under serious risk in developing dental fluorosis fig 5 shows a case of dental fluorosis of a 7 year old child residing in premtala mauza average fluoride content in groundwater 4 2 1 3 mg l urinary fluoride content of the child 9 7 mg l the cumulative noncancerous lifetime hazard index hi cumulative conveys the noncancerous risk to a population for lifelong toxic exposure scenario here the hi cumulative was evaluated for simultaneous fluoride and arsenic exposure conditions and the exposure time period was considered to be 3 70 years the estimated hi cumulative in the cte and rme scenarios was 10 and 22 respectively table 2 the greater the hi cumulative value the greater is the risk of developing severe chronic toxicity of fluoride and arsenic among people the poor socioeconomical condition scarcity of proper healthcare facility malnutrition etc in addition to the considerable groundwater pollution may have synergistic effects on the health of people brahman et al 2014 the obtained results are thus highly distressing alarming and inevitably demand prompt attention and mitigation consumption of fluoride or arsenic contaminated drinking water was long established as the primary pathway of exposure to human beings ohno et al 2007 bhattacharya et al 2017 according to some reports further accumulation of fluoride and arsenic in rice pulses vegetables meat and tea through water soil plant animal transport mechanism and their subsequent consumption would cause even higher threats to human health ullah et al 2017 3 3 assessment of the retention of fluoride and arsenic among people after their urinary excretion the absorption and excretion of fluoride and arsenic in body are governed by different metabolic processes zheng et al 2002 after dietary intake of fluoride and arsenic in human beings their urinary excretion is the most favorable route for their removal from body rango et al 2014 thus the urinary fluoride and urinary arsenic contents were determined in 100 samples for the assessment of the retention of fluoride and arsenic in residents of the study area table 3 the resulted data showed the presence of alarmingly high content of urinary fluoride average concentration 3 1 1 2 mg l in children teenagers and adults of the dharmanagar region in other studies on indian population fluoride in urine samples was reported in the range of 0 1 17 mg l when fluoride concentrations in drinking water were 1 6 3 3 mg l singh et al 2007 das and mondal 2016 kumar et al 2017 similar observations of higher urinary fluoride contents as compared to the concentration of fluoride in drinking water were also made by xiang et al 2003 rango et al 2014 and carmen et al 2016 in their respective studies conducted in chinese ethiopian and mexican children the urinary fluoride contents in the population under investigation were found to be positively correlated r 0 46 with the groundwater fluoride contents fig 6 a this finding is in agreement with earlier reports rango et al 2017 khanoranga and khalid 2019 moreover the urinary fluoride contents were estimated to be 65 163 of the total fluoride intake 1 9 7 2 mg day thus it is evident that the residents were exposed to fluoride from other sources in addition to our studied drinking water pathway these sources may be dietary intakes of rice pulses fruits vegetables and tea cultivated with the fluoride contaminated groundwater bhattacharya et al 2017 as well as may be uses of fluoridated toothpastes or tobacco products khanoranga and khalid 2019 and also may be the consumption of milk and meat international programme on chemical safety ipcs 2002 in some of the previously conducted studies on fluorosis severity especially dental fluorosis in children was shown to be positively correlated with high urinary fluoride contents jarquín yañez et al 2015 carmen et al 2016 the urinary arsenic levels of the studied population 0 005 0 008 mg day were found to be within the normal level of arsenic in urine of human beings 0 005 0 04 mg day urinary arsenic of the population under study was observed to be significantly correlated r 0 69 with the groundwater arsenic contents fig 6b this finding is concurrent with the previous reported observations by uchino et al 2006 and sun bae et al 2013 the retention of arsenic in the studied population was found to be 58 83 of the total arsenic intakes 0 012 0 048 mg day in some studies arsenic was reported to be more capable of accumulating in human body with respect to fluoride zheng et al 2002 sun bae et al 2013 hence urinary contents of fluoride and arsenic can be well utilized to understand the retention of these two toxicants in the studied population 4 conclusions both fluoride and arsenic is significantly responsible for worldwide groundwater pollution phenomenon and related deteriorated public health issues the present study was thus conducted to analyze co occurrence of fluoride and arsenic in groundwater of the dharmanagar region north tripura india the results clearly showed that on contrary to only shallow aquifer contamination by fluoride and arsenic reports from pakistan and nepal the shallow moderately deep as well as deeper aquifers of the study area have all been contaminated by these two toxicants the average fluoride content 1 8 0 9 mg l and average arsenic content 0 012 0 005 mg l therefore the groundwater is completely unsafe for consumption in the studied areas with respect to these two toxicants the significant association observed between fluoride and arsenic contents in groundwater r 0 6 implies that when one of these toxicants is found in any groundwater of north tripura the sample should be immediately analyzed to determine the presence of the other toxicant similar correlation between fluoride and arsenic contents in groundwater was earlier reported from studies conducted in china pakistan and india but both the toxicants showed poor association with iron contents in groundwater of the study area all the hazard indices calculated for the population living in the dharmanagar region were 1 and thus the entire population is at risk from fluorosis and arsenicosis periodic medical camps should be conducted to diagnose dental fluorosis among children at an early stage since the incidence of dental fluorosis is expected to rise with time the computed edi fluoride for the children 0 1 mg kg day the observed urinary fluoride and urinary arsenic contents in the studied population reflected the degree of fluoride and arsenic consumption the calculated edi cumulative values 0 07 0 18 mg kg day in the present study were although found to be far lower than the previously reported values from pakistan by brahman et al 2014 and rasool et al 2015 but the presence of high content of urinary fluoride 3 1 4 7 mg day suggested that the residents of the study area were exposed to fluoride from other sources in addition to the drinking water pathway further study is underway to detect the transport of fluoride and arsenic in rice fruit vegetable and tea samples cultivated utilizing the contaminated groundwater of the study area arsenic concentrations in urine 0 005 0 008 mg day did not exceed the permissible urinary arsenic limits water is a scarce resource in north tripura thus the situation necessitates continuous and rigorous drinking water quality monitoring for its sustainable management additionally immediate effective strategies should be taken by the government to supply safe drinking water from centralized treatment facilities declaration of competing interest the

12074,automobile workshops can be found in many places in pakistan and most of them are located near the residential areas some activities in automobile workshops can release heavy metals having the adverse impacts for human health islamabad and rawalpindi are twin cities in northern pakistan where automobile workshops have been operated almost forty years and have never been studied their impact on the surroundings therefore there is a need to identify heavy metal contaminants in the groundwater to avoid the health hazards this research aimed to evaluate the heavy metal contaminants in the groundwater samples from thirty selected locations points near automobile workshops the physicochemical properties including ph electrical conductance ec total suspended solids tss total dissolved solids tds and the concentrations of anionic f and cl and several heavy metal ions were assessed the ph and tds values of almost all samples were within the permissible limits the ec values were ranging from 0 79 to 1 80 μs cm with an average value of 1 12 μs cm while the tss values were ranging from 210 to 620 mg l with an average value of 431 3 mg l several samples had higher level of f ions and several others had free of f ions the concentrations of cl ions were below the permissible limits almost all heavy metal ions such as ni2 co2 zn2 pb2 cr3 cd2 fe2 and mn2 were obtained in higher concentration than the permissible limits except for as3 ions besides the existing of one metal has correlation with other metals in future the rapid green facile and new method to remove or adsorb the heavy metal ions from groundwater or other environmental water samples can be investigated for large scale production graphical abstract image 1 keywords heavy metals automobile workshops

limits of who and pak epa ph 6 5 8 5 the ph values of almost all water samples 7 0 ph 8 3 were within the standard limits except for two water samples collected from ws 2 and ws 30 with the ph of 4 0 according to who guidances health effects are very prominent in extreme ph values the water ph above 11 0 and below 4 0 can induce the skin eye and mucous membrane irritations kulthanan et al 2013 next the tds values in the groundwater samples were found ranging from 530 to 1240 mg l with the average of 754 2 mg l fig 2c and d the lowest tds value was found in ws 3 sample and the highest tds value was found in ws 9 sample most of groundwater samples had tds values below of the standard limits of who pak epa 1000 mg l and some of them were found to be above the permissible limits such as in ws 1 ws 2 ws 9 ws 19 ws 24 and ws 29 with tds values of 1230 1090 1240 1225 1090 1090 mg l respectively a high level of tds is so dangerous for humans therefore continous use of polluted water might lead kidney disease meride and ayenew 2016 the sources responded for the addition of tds in groundwater samples are natural sources sewage industrial wastewater urban run off plumbing and chemicals used in the water process who 2017 the ec values of groundwater samples from different location points were also evaluated the ec values were ranged from 0 79 to 1 80 μs cm with the average value of 1 12 μs cm fig 3 a the minimum and maximum ec values were found in the location points of ws 3 ws 13 ws 28 and ws 1 ws 9 respectively further the tss levels of the groundwater samples were analyzed the tss levels were ranging from 210 to 620 mg l with the average value of 431 3 mg l fig 3b the lowest value was found in ws 2 and the highest value was found in ws 29 the ec and tss values are unable to be compared with the who pak epa standards due to not applicable values furthermore the concentration of f ions in all water samples were analyzed and the results were confirmed with the range value of 0 0 3 4 mg l and the average value of 0 83 mg l fig 4 a and b comparing to permissible limits 1 50 mg l some groundwater samples had the f concentration above 1 50 mg l such as ws 1 2 0

serious threat to human health such as hypocalcemia vomiting dental fluorosis gastric irritation coma birth defects and cancer ullah et al 2017 in addition the level of cl ions in all groundwater samples were measured and found ranging from 60 23 to 131 0 mg l with the average value of 86 83 mg l fig 4c and d the concentrations of cl ions in all groundwater samples were lower than the permissible limits 250 mg l the highest value 131 0 mg l was obtained from ws 9 sample and the lowest value 60 23 mg l was obtained from ws 8 sample the toxicity of cl ions cannot be observed in human except for the special case of hypochloremia hyperchloremia and dyschloremia associated with heart failure pfortmueller et al 2018 all above results of physicochemical parameters for selected groundwater samples are tabulated in table 3 this table gives the comparison of ph tds f and cl values found in groundwater samples with who and pak epa permissible values the permissible limit values from who and pak epa are not applicable for ec and tss 3 2 level of heavy metal ions in groundwater samples all groundwater samples were evaluated to specify the concentrations of various heavy metal ions and the findings are tabulated in table 4 the concentration of zn2 ions were analyzed with showing the values ranging from 3 05 to 5 13 mg l and the average value was 3 74 mg l fig 5 a comparing to the permissible limit values of who pak epa 5 0 mg l and 3 0 mg l all groundwater samples contained the zn2 ions above the permissible limit value of who but lower than the permissible limit value of pak epa except for ws 3 sample with a little high value 5 13 mg l a high zn2 concentration was possible due to the aging of automobile workshops with the use of zn metal for the galvanizing other metals and as metal deteriorating the outer zn layer enters into the water and most important source is the degradation of galvanized iron utang et al 2013 several health problems associated with a high level of zn metal are focal neuronal deficits metal fume fever diarrhea prostate cancer etc plum et al 2010 the groundwater samples were further analyzed for the level of cr3 ion concentration the concentration level was ranging from 0 05 to 0 73 mg l with an average value of 0 09 mg l fig 5b the cr3 value of ws 9 was same with permissible limit value 0 05 mg l and other groundwater samples had the value above it the high values of cr3 ions were found in ws 3 0 170 mg l ws 12 0 100 mg l and ws 28 0 730 mg l the high value of cr3 ions was correlated to the activity in automobile workshops where the mechanic uses cr metal to prevent the steel from the corrosion when it deteriorates cr3 ions find its way to the groundwater through seepage the high level of cr3 ions can cause to some health problems such as kidney problems liver damage and tumors smith and steinmaus 2009 next the concentration of pb2 ions was found with the concentration range of 0 03 0 20 mg l and 0 055 mg l of average value fig 5c all groundwater samples contained the concentration value of pb2 ions above the permissible limit provided by who 0 01 mg l but half of them are below and above the permissible limit value of pak epa 0 05 mg l the highest pb2 values were found in ws 3 0 20 mg l ws 18 0 135 mg l and ws 27 0 109 mg l possible source of pb2 ions in groundwater correlated to the motor batteries and pb metal used by mechanics in automobile workshops moreover the concentrations of ni2 ions was found in the concentration range between 0 005 and 0 33 mg l with the average value 0 092 mg l fig 5d almost all groundwater samples contained higher values of ni2 ions than permissible limit value 0 02 mg l except for ws 11 0 005 mg l the highest value of ni2 ions was found in ws 3 sample the contamination of ni metal in the groundwater was due to the automobile workshop activities correlated to the electroplating catalyst ni cd batteries and welding purpose kumar et al 2019 high intake of ni metal can induce various diseases such as allergic dermatitis nasal inflammation and asthma brera and nicolini 2005 besides above heavy metal ions several other metal ions including co2 cd2 fe2 and mn2 and as3 ions were also evaluated from the groundwater samples the water samples contained co2 ion concentration was ranging from 0 09 to 0 23 mg l with an average value of 0 17 mg l fig 6 a all groundwater samples contained higher level of co2 ions than the permissible limit value 0 05 mg l the highest level of co2 ions was obtained from ws 27 0 22 mg l ws 3 0 23 mg l and ws 8 0 23 mg l the waste of electrical materials and painting of automobile spare parts produced by the mechanic activities might be the reason of containing co metal in the water samples this metal adsorbs on the soil and contaminates the groundwater by leaching process abidemi 2011 a high concentration of co metal can damage the important body organs such as cardiomyopathy nausea vomiting chronic thyroiditis polycythemia dermatitis asthma and lung cancer leyssens et al 2017 further the concentrations of cd2 ions were obtained in the range of 0 034 0 135 mg l with an average of 0 059 mg l fig 6b all groundwater samples contained the level of cd2 ions above the permissible limits the highest value was found in ws 7 and ws 18 samples the presence of cd metal in groundwater samples is due to various automechanic activities cd a by product of zinc production is one of the most toxic elements associated with some diseases such as cancer renal dysfunction and diabetics bernard 2008 fe2 and mn2 ions were also found in the groundwater samples with the concentration ranges of 0 845 2 179 mg l and 0 51 0 91 mg l with the average values of 1 468 mg l and 0 627 mg l respectively fig 6c and d all concentration values of fe2 and mn2 ions were higher than the permissible limit values but not too high the lowest and highest concentrations of fe2 ions were found in ws 9 and w 4 while the lowest and the highest concentration of mn2 ions were found in w 19 and w 3 respectively the contamination of fe metal in the groundwater samples was due to the mechanic activities in automobile workshops such as welding and soldering and automobile body work fe metal exposure can damage cells in the heart and liver causing adverse effects such as vomiting diarrhea lethargy coma hyperglycemia gastric scarring liver failure coagulopathy and acute tubular necrosis baranwal and singhi 2003 mn metal could be released from the unused batteries of automobile and steel coating the exposure of a high level of mn2 ions can cause parkinson s or alzheimer s diseases o neal and zheng 2015 positive thing no as3 ions were found in all groundwater samples 3 3 correlation matrix analysis the correlation matrix analysis is performed to explore the relationships of parameters and heavy metals and ascertain the probable common sources of the heavy metals in the groundwater samples ali zamani et al 2012 the correlation setting computes the pair wise associations for a set of variables and exhibits a matrix the results of correlation were calculated using the entire raw data it is helpful for determining the potency and guide of the correlation between two variables the 1 and 1 values refer to strong negatif and positive relationships a 0 value shows no linear correlation among the variables as shown in table 5 the high positive correlation exist for tds ec tss ni tss co zn ni pb ni pb cd ni mn co mn r 0 400 the strong positive correlation between the heavy metals shows that an increase in the level of one heavy metal in the groundwater may result in an increase of the level of the other heavy metals since correlation does not imply causation the presence of one heavy metal in the groundwater samples does not necessarily guarantee the presence of another heavy metal some other parameters and heavy metals exhibited good positive correlation with each other such as tss cr tss pb tss mn zn pb zn ni zn co zn cd zn mn pb ni pb co pb cd pb mn ni co ni cd ni mn co cd and co mn 0 200 r 0 400 most of the heavy metals exhibited good correlation with each other denoting a general source for the heavy metals the correlation analysis showed that most heavy metals were significantly correlated with each other and reflected reflects their related possible origin the wastes which indiscriminately disposed within the various workshops are possible sources of heavy metals of significant interests the negative correlations were observed for ph tds ph ec tds tss tds cr tds co tds mn ec tss ec cr ec co ec mn tss f tss fe f cl f mn cl zn cl cr cl ni showing no significant relationship between them this implies that the concentration of one parameter increases while the other decreases 3 4 groundwater quality management another finding of the study is the levels of heavy metal ions in the groundwater samples collected from near to old automobile workshops were extremely high all automobile workshops near to the groundwater sample location points were not cemented and no proper waste disposal system was observed the metal ions can absorb into the groundwater through leaching process herein several recommendations for maintaining the water quality from the groundwater close to the automobile workshop areas were provided first the wastes of automobile workshops should be handled properly or recycled before being discarded into the right place to omit the harmful effects on environmental water sources second the mechanics in automobile workshops should be trained and aware of hazardous materials in their workshops hence they should wear appropriate gloves and work suite when handling the automobiles which were not seen during this study third automobile workshops should be far from the residential areas as the groundwater can be polluted by these industrial activities forth as all chosen automobile workshops were not cemented the ground should be cemented to prevent the infiltration of toxic chemical materials into the soils fifth the wells contaminated with heavy metals should be stopped to use finally the people stay near the automobile workshop areas should be alert and aware to know the groundwater contamination in their wells so that it is important to notify the people to drill the wells at least up to 280 ft 85 34 m or above it 4 conclusions in this study the ph values of almost all groundwater samples were 7 0 ph 8 3 within the permissible limits except for ws 2 and ws 30 at ph 4 0 the lowest and highest tds values were found in ws 3 and ws 9 with most of values within the permissible limit value the minimum and maximum ec values were found in the ws 3 ws 13 ws 28 and ws 1 ws 9 while the minimum and maximum tss values were found in ws 2 and ws 29 respectively the ec and tss values are unable to be compared with the who pak epa standards due to not applicable values several groundwater samples had higher level of f and several others had free of f ions the concentrations of cl ions were below the permissible limits almost all heavy metal ions such as ni2 co2 zn2 pb2 cr3 cd2 fe2 and mn2 were obtained with higher concentration than the standard limits by the regulations no as3 ions were found in all water samples it can be concluded that the wastes of automobile workshop activities accumulated in soils followed by the migration or leaching into the sub soil and contaminates the groundwater the unusual waste disposal now requires much concern to maintain the groundwater quality some recommendations for maintaining the quality of groundwater nearby the automobile workshops are provided including treatment of effluents safety training for mechanics the distance of workshops to the residential areas the cementation of workshop floor closing the polluted wells and the public alert and awareness of water contamination funding no any financial supports have been received for

12074,automobile workshops can be found in many places in pakistan and most of them are located near the residential areas some activities in automobile workshops can release heavy metals having the adverse impacts for human health islamabad and rawalpindi are twin cities in northern pakistan where automobile workshops have been operated almost forty years and have never been studied their impact on the surroundings therefore there is a need to identify heavy metal contaminants in the groundwater to avoid the health hazards this research aimed to evaluate the heavy metal contaminants in the groundwater samples from thirty selected locations points near automobile workshops the physicochemical properties including ph electrical conductance ec total suspended solids tss total dissolved solids tds and the concentrations of anionic f and cl and several heavy metal ions were assessed the ph and tds values of almost all samples were within the permissible limits the ec values were ranging from 0 79 to 1 80 μs cm with an average value of 1 12 μs cm while the tss values were ranging from 210 to 620 mg l with an average value of 431 3 mg l several samples had higher level of f ions and several others had free of f ions the concentrations of cl ions were below the permissible limits almost all heavy metal ions such as ni2 co2 zn2 pb2 cr3 cd2 fe2 and mn2 were obtained in higher concentration than the permissible limits except for as3 ions besides the existing of one metal has correlation with other metals in future the rapid green facile and new method to remove or adsorb the heavy metal ions from groundwater or other environmental water samples can be investigated for large scale production graphical abstract image 1 keywords heavy metals automobile workshops

of pak epa except for ws 3 sample with a little high value 5 13 mg l a high zn2 concentration was possible due to the aging of automobile workshops with the use of zn metal for the galvanizing other metals and as metal deteriorating the outer zn layer enters into the water and most important source is the degradation of galvanized iron utang et al 2013 several health problems associated with a high level of zn metal are focal neuronal deficits metal fume fever diarrhea prostate cancer etc plum et al 2010 the groundwater samples were further analyzed for the level of cr3 ion concentration the concentration level was ranging from 0 05 to 0 73 mg l with an average value of 0 09 mg l fig 5b the cr3 value of ws 9 was same with permissible limit value 0 05 mg l and other groundwater samples had the value above it the high values of cr3 ions were found in ws 3 0 170 mg l ws 12 0 100 mg l and ws 28 0 730 mg l the high value of cr3 ions was correlated to the activity in automobile workshops where the mechanic uses cr metal to prevent the steel from the corrosion when it deteriorates cr3 ions find its way to the groundwater through seepage the high level of cr3 ions can cause to some health problems such as kidney problems liver damage and tumors smith and steinmaus 2009 next the concentration of pb2 ions was found with the concentration range of 0 03 0 20 mg l and 0 055 mg l of average value fig 5c all groundwater samples contained the concentration value of pb2 ions above the permissible limit provided by who 0 01 mg l but half of them are below and above the permissible limit value of pak epa 0 05 mg l the highest pb2 values were found in ws 3 0 20 mg l ws 18 0 135 mg l and ws 27 0 109 mg l possible source of pb2 ions in groundwater correlated to the motor batteries and pb metal used by mechanics in automobile workshops moreover the concentrations of ni2 ions was found in the concentration range between 0 005 and 0 33 mg l with the average value 0 092 mg l fig 5d almost all groundwater samples contained higher values of ni2 ions than permissible limit value 0 02 mg l except for ws 11 0 005 mg l the highest value of ni2 ions was found in ws 3 sample the contamination of ni metal in the groundwater was due to the automobile workshop activities correlated to the electroplating catalyst ni cd batteries and welding purpose kumar et al 2019 high intake of ni metal can induce various diseases such as allergic dermatitis nasal inflammation and asthma brera and nicolini 2005 besides above heavy metal ions several other metal ions including co2 cd2 fe2 and mn2 and as3 ions were also evaluated from the groundwater samples the water samples contained co2 ion concentration was ranging from 0 09 to 0 23 mg l with an average value of 0 17 mg l fig 6 a all groundwater samples contained higher level of co2 ions than the permissible limit value 0 05 mg l the highest level of co2 ions was obtained from ws 27 0 22 mg l ws 3 0 23 mg l and ws 8 0 23 mg l the waste of electrical materials and painting of automobile spare parts produced by the mechanic activities might be the reason of containing co metal in the water samples this metal adsorbs on the soil and contaminates the groundwater by leaching process abidemi 2011 a high concentration of co metal can damage the important body organs such as cardiomyopathy nausea vomiting chronic thyroiditis polycythemia dermatitis asthma and lung cancer leyssens et al 2017 further the concentrations of cd2 ions were obtained in the range of 0 034 0 135 mg l with an average of 0 059 mg l fig 6b all groundwater samples contained the level of cd2 ions above the permissible limits the highest value was found in ws 7 and ws 18 samples the presence of cd metal in groundwater samples is due to various automechanic activities cd a by product of zinc production is one of the most toxic elements associated with some diseases such as cancer renal dysfunction and diabetics bernard 2008 fe2 and mn2 ions were also found in the groundwater samples with the concentration ranges of 0 845 2 179 mg l and 0 51 0 91 mg l with the average values of 1 468 mg l and 0 627 mg l respectively fig 6c and d all concentration values of fe2 and mn2 ions were higher than the permissible limit values but not too high the lowest and highest concentrations of fe2 ions were found in ws 9 and w 4 while the lowest and the highest concentration of mn2 ions were found in w 19 and w 3 respectively the contamination of fe metal in the groundwater samples was due to the mechanic activities in automobile workshops such as welding and soldering and automobile body work fe metal exposure can damage cells in the heart and liver causing adverse effects such as vomiting diarrhea lethargy coma hyperglycemia gastric scarring liver failure coagulopathy and acute tubular necrosis baranwal and singhi 2003 mn metal could be released from the unused batteries of automobile and steel coating the exposure of a high level of mn2 ions can cause parkinson s or alzheimer s diseases o neal and zheng 2015 positive thing no as3 ions were found in all groundwater samples 3 3 correlation matrix analysis the correlation matrix analysis is performed to explore the relationships of parameters and heavy metals and ascertain the probable common sources of the heavy metals in the groundwater samples ali zamani et al 2012 the correlation setting computes the pair wise associations for a set of variables and exhibits a matrix the results of correlation were calculated using the entire raw data it is helpful for determining the potency and guide of the correlation between two variables the 1 and 1 values refer to strong negatif and positive relationships a 0 value shows no linear correlation among the variables as shown in table 5 the high positive correlation exist for tds ec tss ni tss co zn ni pb ni pb cd ni mn co mn r 0 400 the strong positive correlation between the heavy metals shows that an increase in the level of one heavy metal in the groundwater may result in an increase of the level of the other heavy metals since correlation does not imply causation the presence of one heavy metal in the groundwater samples does not necessarily guarantee the presence of another heavy metal some other parameters and heavy metals exhibited good positive correlation with each other such as tss cr tss pb tss mn zn pb zn ni zn co zn cd zn mn pb ni pb co pb cd pb mn ni co ni cd ni mn co cd and co mn 0 200 r 0 400 most of the heavy metals exhibited good correlation with each other denoting a general source for the heavy metals the correlation analysis showed that most heavy metals were significantly correlated with each other and reflected reflects their related possible origin the wastes which indiscriminately disposed within the various workshops are possible sources of heavy metals of significant interests the negative correlations were observed for ph tds ph ec tds tss tds cr tds co tds mn ec tss ec cr ec co ec mn tss f tss fe f cl f mn cl zn cl cr cl ni showing no significant relationship between them this implies that the concentration of one parameter increases while the other decreases 3 4 groundwater quality management another finding of the study is the levels of heavy metal ions in the groundwater samples collected from near to old automobile workshops were extremely high all automobile workshops near to the groundwater sample location points were not cemented and no proper waste disposal system was observed the metal ions can absorb into the groundwater through leaching process herein several recommendations for maintaining the water quality from the groundwater close to the automobile workshop areas were provided first the wastes of automobile workshops should be handled properly or recycled before being discarded into the right place to omit the harmful effects on environmental water sources second the mechanics in automobile workshops should be trained and aware of hazardous materials in their workshops hence they should wear appropriate gloves and work suite when handling the automobiles which were not seen during this study third automobile workshops should be far from the residential areas as the groundwater can be polluted by these industrial activities forth as all chosen automobile workshops were not cemented the ground should be cemented to prevent the infiltration of toxic chemical materials into the soils fifth the wells contaminated with heavy metals should be stopped to use finally the people stay near the automobile workshop areas should be alert and aware to know the groundwater contamination in their wells so that it is important to notify the people to drill the wells at least up to 280 ft 85 34 m or above it 4 conclusions in this study the ph values of almost all groundwater samples were 7 0 ph 8 3 within the permissible limits except for ws 2 and ws 30 at ph 4 0 the lowest and highest tds values were found in ws 3 and ws 9 with most of values within the permissible limit value the minimum and maximum ec values were found in the ws 3 ws 13 ws 28 and ws 1 ws 9 while the minimum and maximum tss values were found in ws 2 and ws 29 respectively the ec and tss values are unable to be compared with the who pak epa standards due to not applicable values several groundwater samples had higher level of f and several others had free of f ions the concentrations of cl ions were below the permissible limits almost all heavy metal ions such as ni2 co2 zn2 pb2 cr3 cd2 fe2 and mn2 were obtained with higher concentration than the standard limits by the regulations no as3 ions were found in all water samples it can be concluded that the wastes of automobile workshop activities accumulated in soils followed by the migration or leaching into the sub soil and contaminates the groundwater the unusual waste disposal now requires much concern to maintain the groundwater quality some recommendations for maintaining the quality of groundwater nearby the automobile workshops are provided including treatment of effluents safety training for mechanics the distance of workshops to the residential areas the cementation of workshop floor closing the polluted wells and the public alert and awareness of water contamination funding no any financial supports have been received for
