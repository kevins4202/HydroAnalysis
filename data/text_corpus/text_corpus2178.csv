10890,irrigation improves yield but can create conflicts with other water uses during dry periods based on this the aim of this study is to assess the economic returns provided by irrigation of common beans during the rainfed season in central brazil common bean yield was simulated for 30 growing seasons using the crop model dssat cropgro drybean with parameters calibrated for the cultivar pérola the yield simulations considered sowing dates from nov 01 to jan 01 at each 15 days and four water managements rainfed and irrigation starting at 70 50 and 30 of the total soil water available tswa yield and irrigation costs were obtained from official institutes that assess net revenue considering sales prices from r 1 33 to r 5 00 per kg the rainfed system yield ranged from 500 to 3000 kg ha 1 the irrigation at 70 50 and 30 of twsa increased yield respectively from 26 7 to 41 4 from 5 5 to 14 5 and from 0 4 to 2 4 in relation to the rainfed system with ranges depending on sowing dates the average demand of 53 mm cycle 1 range between 0 to 100 mm cycle 1 was required by the water management 70 of tswa however the 50 of tswa required an average demand of 19 mm cycle 1 and the 30 of tswa in most growing seasons did not require irrigation the net revenue was affected by sales prices and sowing dates preferentially early sowing a minimum sales price ranging from r 1 85 to r 2 83 per kg is required according to the water management and the sowing date for an internal return rate higher than 12 irrigation at 70 of tswa provided a similar or better economic index and a higher yield than the rainfed system it is an interesting water management option because water is used when the river water level is higher ensuring yield stability and food production keywords phaseolus vulgaris l irrigation management climate risk economic analysis crop model yield stability 1 introduction common bean phaseolus vulgaris l is the most produced and consumed legume crop in the world brazil is the third major producer among producing countries fao 2018 covering 3 2 million hectares and yielding 3 1 million tons in the 2017 18 growing season conab 2019 this crop has a great importance for national economic and social returns creating profit to small and large farmers in brazil in brazil the state of goiás is one of the major common bean producer 367 000 tons were produced in the 2017 18 growing season conab 2019 including the production resulting from three growing seasons along the year these periods are classified into rainfall dry and winter seasons the production occurs in 85 of the districts in the region where a change has occurred in the common bean production type based on small farmer sustenance recently the number of farmers with a high technological level has been growing irrigation is thus an option barbosa and gonzaga 2012 common bean growing during rainfall and dry seasons is characterized by the sowing dates respectively from november to december and from january to february both periods have water supply from rainfalls in the winter season the sowing occurs from may to june with water supply mostly from irrigation heinemann et al 2016 the common bean is grown in rotation with other crops such as soybean maize and tomato the use of irrigation during winter seasons has led to the highest yield between growing periods because during rainfall and dry seasons irrigation is not used due to rainfalls however the irregular distribution leads to water deficit during the growing season heinemann et al 2016 sales et al 2016 the water is one of the main limiting factors for brazilian agriculture sentelhas et al 2015 battisti et al 2018a common beans decreased its potential yield by 34 in the district of santo antônio de goiás state of goiás the region of this study considering the average of 21 growing seasons meireles et al 2003 in addition yield losses by water deficit can increase due to global warming silva et al 2010 the occurrence of water deficit during crop emergence and maturation can reduce yield by 20 while during the vegetative and reproductive period it can reduce the potential yield by 75 oliveira and silva 1990 irrigation stands out as an important alternative to reduce this type of risk sales et al 2018 almeida et al 2018 battisti et al 2018b central pivot system irrigates crops rotating around a pivot by spraying water with sprinklers this system has been expanding in central brazil due to the possibility of using this system for different crops including common beans maize soybean tomato coffee and grass the state of goiás had 242 000 ha using this system in 2016 imb 2018 irrigation is used mainly during the winter seasons due to absence of rainfalls leading to low flows in watercourses from which water is collected for irrigation hidroweb 2019 thus we propose to obtain a water use license to use water from the river during the rainfed season to irrigate crops during the short dry period thus avoiding water deficit in the crop growing and increasing yield euclydes et al 2006 the issue is economic costs in using a central pivot to irrigate common beans during the rainfall period the hypothesis of this study is that irrigation in the rainfed season avoids soil water deficit and increases the yield of common beans the irrigation is to be performed using center pivot as water supply during a period of year when there is water available from watercourses avoiding water use conflicts the aim of this research is to assess economic returns common yield and water demand using a central pivot irrigation system during the rainfed season in santo antônio de goiás state of goiás brazil 2 material and methods 2 1 site and weather data the research was conducted in the region of santo antônio de goiás state of goiás fig 1 this region has had a significant presence of central pivot irrigation systems but the use of irrigation during the dry period winter season has been creating water use conflicts with the human consumption by the population from the capital city goiânia which has 1 5 million inhabitants this condition creates a possibility of expansion of production of common beans during rainfed seasons a period of the year when there is a water surplus in the area fig 2 the weather station was located at the latitude 16 47 longitude 49 28 and 823 m a

water application of 8 8 mm day 1 the irrigation system had pumping costs associated with irrigation managements which change due to energy costs according to the time the central pivot was used for irrigation based on the amount requirement simulated supplementary material table s1 the variable cost was quantified considering an engine of 100 hp and an energy cost of r 0 48 per kw hour the total costs were computed for five sowing dates and four water managements by calculating the economic viability for each condition the total growing season costs per water management were r 3 379 49 r 3 628 85 r 3 588 21 and r 3 581 64 per hectare respectively for rainfall and irrigation at 70 50 and 30 of tswa the initial costs were r 17 237 46 for rainfed and r 367 237 46 for the irrigation systems supplemental material table s1 2 4 selling prices and economic analysis the central pivot system was evaluated considering the economic viability obtained based on gross income by multiplying common

center pivot durability garzel 2003 frizzone and andrade júnior 2005 the minimum price sale was defined in order to obtain the minimum internal rate of return based on linear regression the calculations were performed using the excel sheet amazonsaf obtained from arco verde and amaro 2011 3 results and discussions 3 1 irrigation management the yield of common beans increased when irrigation was applied in comparison with the rainfed system fig 3 a the rainfed system had a higher yield variability from 500 kg ha 1 to near 3000 kg ha 1 the yield range for rainfed had the highest risk associated with common beans yield across 30 rainfed growing seasons meireles et al 2003 observed that in the region of this study the rainfed season has a higher risk of yield gap by water deficit due to the rainfall distribution during this period irrigation is preferential during the winter season the sowing date jan 01 had the highest yield range and the lowest median fig 3a the median yield was 1835 1784 1495 1484 and 1433 kg ha 1 respectively for the sowing dates nov 01 nov 15 dec 01 dec 15 and jan 01 fig 3a showing a statistical significance p 3 70 10 5 supplementary material table s2 irrigation management increased yield reduced yield range in the growing seasons fig 3a and showed a statistical significance p 1 72 10 21 supplementary material table s2 irrigation can help to improve water productivity and reduce environmental costs zheng et al 2019 especially because water is abundant during the common bean rainfed growing period the higher yield increase was obtained at 70 of tswa increasing the mean yield by 26 7 30 9 37 0 36 5 and 41 4 respectively for nov 01 nov 15 dec 01 dec 15 and jan 01 compared with the rainfed system despite the results there was no significant interaction between irrigation managements and sowing dates regarding common bean yield supplementary material table s2 for the water management of 50 and 30 of tswa the yield gain ranged from 5 5 to 14 5 and from 0 4 to 2 4 respectively indicating a lower contribution to yield by these levels of irrigation santana et al 2009 evaluated common bean yield using irrigation of 40 70 100 130 and 160 of the volume required to refill the soil until field capacity and verified that yield improved up to the irrigation level of 100 field capacity there was a yield reduction when the sowing date was delayed from nov 01 to jan 01 in all managements fig 3a the yield reduction was from 1830 to 1444 kg ha 1 using the rainfall system between the sowing dates nov 01 and jan 01 fig 3a the lower mean yield reduction was observed for water management 70 of tswa decrease to 277 kg ha 1 while at 30 the decrease reached 370 kg ha 1 the results indicate that a delay in the sowing date nov 01 reduced common bean yield due to cycle duration air temperature and solar radiation potentiated by the increase in water deficit muasya et al 2008 battisti and sentelhas 2014 the irrigation volume required was 53 mm cycle 1 for the 70 of tswa water management fig 3b resulting in an at least 26 7 higher yield considering 30 growing seasons and five sowing dates marrou et al 2014 highlighted that evaluation of irrigation management is essential to improve bean yield using less water as is the case of 70 of tswa for this irrigation management the sowing date jan 01 required a higher median value of 59 mm cycle 1 followed by nov 01 and dec 15 57 mm cycle 1 dec 01 46 mm cycle 1 and nov 15 45 mm cycle 1 fig 3b the irrigation management level of 50 of tswa required an average of 19 mm cycle 1 fig 3b with at least 25 of the growing season did not require irrigation at 30 of tswa most growing seasons did not require irrigation fig 3b and limited the yield increase to no more than 14 5 in these conditions the analysis of variance indicated a statistical significance only for irrigation management p 2 0 10 16 and no significance for sowing dates or interactions between them supplementary material table s2 3 2 economic assessment per production system the net present value npv increased when common bean sales price increase from r 1 33 to r 5 00 per kg fig 4 a and b the irrigation at 70 of tswa showed higher values with a maximum npv of r 4 16 and 3 38 million respectively for the sowing dates nov 01 and jan 01 fig 4a and b considering a period of 30 years the npv for irrigation at 50 and 30 of tswa was lower than or similar to npv for the rainfall condition fig 4a and b both required a higher sales price than irrigation at 70 of tswa to obtain a npv equal to zero following the yield tendency fig 4a the delay of sowing from nov 01 fig 4a to jan 01 fig 4b resulted in a reduction in npv for all managements as an example considering a sales price of r 2 67 per kg the sowing date delayed reduced the npv from r 0 83 to 0 25 million for the rainfall system while at 70 of tswa the reduction was from 1 10 to 0 69 million fig 4a and b the return on investment roi ranged from near 0 5 when sales prices was r 1 33 per kg to more than 2 5 when the prices reached r 5 00 per kg fig 4c and d the sowing date jan 01 showed a lower roi and a higher difference among water managements the late sowing date showed that use of 70 of tswa as an irrigation management resulted in a higher roi than other systems fig 4d which can be ascribed to increase in water deficit due to the late sowing battisti and sentelhas 2014 the payback is an index that defines the time for the return of investment the use of irrigation required a maximum time between eight 70 of tswa and 13 years 30 of tswa fig 4c and d requiring a minimum sales price for a positive roi farmer risks can be reduced by public policies ensuring a minimal price for investment in irrigation systems including other benefits to reduce production costs langarita et al 2017 and ensuring food production the minimum sales prices to obtain a minimum internal return rate of 12 is lower for the rainfall system than for irrigation requiring a minimum sales price between r 1 85 and r 2 34 per kg fig 5 irrigation management at 70 of tswa required a minimum sales price near r 2 38 per kg for the sowing period between nov 01 and dec 15 while jan 01 required r 2 60 per kg however 50 and 30 of tswa required a price of at least r 2 60 per kg for sowing on nov 01 reaching around r 2 83 per kg if there is a sowing date delay for jan 01 fig 5 4 conclusion the use of an irrigation management starting at 70 of total soil water available reduces considerably the yield variability due to the lower water deficit during rainfall seasons showing better or similar economic returns than rainfall conditions the irrigation management starting at 50 and 30 of total soil water available to the crop used a lower volume of water than 70 increasing common bean yield only during growing seasons with extreme water deficit the common bean sales price and sowing dates define the economic index for implementation of the central pivot system the management of irrigation during the rainfall period can be applied to other regions in the world with similar weather patterns in order to improve crop yield avoiding conflict by water uses due to using water from a period of the year when the river flow is higher ensuring yield stability and food production throughout growing seasons

roi ranged from near 0 5 when sales prices was r 1 33 per kg to more than 2 5 when the prices reached r 5 00 per kg fig 4c and d the sowing date jan 01 showed a lower roi and a higher difference among water managements the late sowing date showed that use of 70 of tswa as an irrigation management resulted in a higher roi than other systems fig 4d which can be ascribed to increase in water deficit due to the late sowing battisti and sentelhas 2014 the payback is an index that defines the time for the return of investment the use of irrigation required a maximum time between eight 70 of tswa and 13 years 30 of tswa fig 4c and d requiring a minimum sales price for a positive roi farmer risks can be reduced by public policies ensuring a minimal price for investment in irrigation systems including other benefits to reduce production costs langarita et al 2017 and ensuring food production the minimum sales prices to obtain a minimum internal return rate of 12 is lower for the rainfall system than for irrigation requiring a minimum sales price between r 1 85 and r 2 34 per kg fig 5 irrigation management at 70 of tswa required a minimum sales price near r 2 38 per kg for the sowing period between nov 01 and dec 15 while jan 01 required r 2 60 per kg however 50 and 30 of tswa required a price of at least r 2 60 per kg for sowing on nov 01 reaching around r 2 83 per kg if there is a sowing date delay for jan 01 fig 5 4 conclusion the use of an irrigation management starting at 70 of total soil water available reduces considerably the yield variability due to the lower water deficit during rainfall seasons showing better or similar economic returns than rainfall conditions the irrigation management starting at 50 and 30 of total soil water available to the crop used a lower volume of water than 70 increasing common bean yield only during growing seasons with extreme water deficit the common bean sales price and sowing dates define the economic index for implementation of the central pivot system the management of irrigation during the rainfall period can be applied to other regions in the world with similar weather patterns in order to improve crop yield avoiding conflict by water uses due to using water from a period of the year when the river flow is higher ensuring yield stability and food production throughout growing seasons

10891,understanding the effects of water regimes and straw management on soil organic carbon soc pools is necessary to improve soil c sequestration and soil quality based on a long term field experiment 15 years we examined impacts of water regimes and straw management methods on total soil organic c toc particulate organic c poc and potassium permanganate oxidizable c kmno4 c at two soil depths water regimes consisted of flooding cultivation and non flooded cultivation in non flooded cultivation limited irrigation was employed to keep the soil moist condition without standing water covering the field during the rice growing season it is substantially different from conventional flooded rice cultivation the two straw management methods were straw mulching and straw removal the results showed that water management had greater effects on toc and kmno4 c than did straw management at 0 10 cm soil layer compared to the non flooded treatment flooding cultivation resulted in 17 4 higher toc and 31 4 higher kmno4 c contents correspondingly straw management showed dominant effects on poc straw mulching significantly increased poc content by 13 0 as compared to the straw removal treatment however at deeper soil depth 10 20 cm labile soc fractions were only affected by water regimes the higher carbon management index cmi values at 0 20 cm were recorded in the flooding condition with straw mulching treatment this was attributed to the increased carbon pool index cpi which contributed to the formation of more stable organic compounds that collectively act as a soil reservoir the combined non flooded cultivation and straw mulching method nfc sm produced a similar 15 year average rice grain yield and toc content in 2016 compared to the traditional flooding cultivation with straw removal treatment fc sr our data indicated that nfc sm could be an ideal strategy not only to save water but also to maintain soil fertility keywords soil organic c particulate organic c potassium permanganate oxidizable c water regimes straw management 1 introduction rice is one of the most important food crops in asia and it consumed about 90 of total irrigation water for crops li et al 2007 conventional flooded rice cultivation is very popular and requires a standing water depth of 5 10 cm in the fields consuming about 0 5 3 m3 m 2 during the entire rice growth season qin et al 2006 diminishing water resources in seasonal drought areas present a challenge for this method thus water saving techniques has been employed since the 1980s these included alternate wetting and drying irrigation cabangon et al 2011 non flooded mulching li et al 2017 and aerobic rice systems bouman et al 2006 previous studies have reported the effects of different water regimes on rice grain yield water use efficiency and soil nutrient balance liu et al 2003 kudo et al 2014 recently there has been considerable interest regarding soil organic c soc storage under different water management practices soc plays a key role in the long term soil productivity because it is linked to the physical chemical and biological properties of soil haynes 2005 tian et al 2013a in addition it is important in mitigating atmospheric co2 levels lal 2004 hence the maintenance of satisfactory soc levels is essential to the sustainability of agroecosystems the storage of soc depends on the balance between the c input derived from crop residues and the c output from soil organic matter som decomposition yan et al 2013 tian et al 2013b showed that aerobic environments have higher decomposition rates of som than anaerobic environments therefore different water management practices may affect soc level li et al 2007 reported that continuous plastic film mulching with no flooding decreased soc content by 8 3 24 5 at five sites compared to traditional flooding management however fan et al 2012 found that non flooded plastic film or non flooded wheat straw mulching resulted in similar or higher soc content compared to traditional flooded cultivation in a 10 year field experiment soil organic c consists of various fractions varying in degree of recalcitrance decomposition and turnover rate wang et al 2014 most of soc 60 70 is found in the passive pool with turnover times extending to thousands of years approximately 20 to 40 of soc is in the slow pool with decadal turnover times while the active fractions comprise less than 5 of the soc the particulate organic c poc and potassium permanganate oxidizable c kmno4 c comprised the slow turnover pool sherrod et al 2005 the influence of different management practices on the contents of soc fractions can provide valuable information about mechanisms of c sequestration six et al 2002 mi et al 2016 measured increases in poc and kmno4 c after the addition of crop residues and manures that were greater than those in total soil organic c toc further active soc fractions are also a major source for c loss tian et al 2013a the oxidation of soc drives the flux of co2 from soils to the atmosphere therefore measurements of poc and kmno4 c are essential to the identification of changes in soc and ultimately environmental sustainability in addition the carbon management index cmi is derived from the total soc pool and c lability and is recommended as an early indicator of the effects of management practices on soil quality chaudhary et al 2017 to the best of our knowledge information is limited on the long term effects of different water regimes and straw managements on soil total organic carbon and its labile fractions therefore based on a 15 year field experiment we evaluated the impacts of different water regimes flooding cultivation and non flooded cultivation and residue management methods straw mulching and straw removal on toc its labile fractions including poc kmno4 c and cmi at different soil depths this information will be useful to develop reasonable management strategies to optimize sustainability of agroecosystems 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site description the experiment was conducted at panzhai country 29 19 n 119 43 e zhejiang province china this region has an intermediate subtropical monsoon climate with mean annual precipitation of 1483 mm and a mean temperature of 19 5 c fig 1 the frost free period is 265 d and the annual sunshine hours are 1982 h from 2001 to 2015 initially the top soil 0 20 cm at the experimental site contained 30 2 g kg 1 organic matter 2 28 g kg 1 total nitrogen n 88 5 mg kg 1 available phosphorus p 212 9 mg kg 1 available potassium k and ph in this case was 5 1 2 2 experimental design the experiment was established in 2001 with a single cropping rice system fields remained fallow during november june of next year treatments were laid out in a split plot randomized complete block design with three replicates it included two water management systems as main plots and two straw management methods as subplots the two water management systems were conventional flooding cultivation fc and non flooded cultivation nfc the two straw management methods consisted of rice straw mulching sm and rice straw removal sr for the rice straw mulching treatment rice straw air dried 3 mg ha 1 were cut into 3 5 cm long segments and applied to the soil surface after rice harvest each year one week before transplanting of rice of next year all plots were artificially leveled and then soaked then rice seedlings were generally transplanted at a spacing of 20 cm 28 cm with two seedlings per hill in late june for the traditional flooding management the plots were flood irrigated every 3 5 days to maintain 2 3 cm layer of water until the grain filling stage of rice for the non flooded treatment soil remained moist without standing water covering the field during the rice growing season limited irrigation 30 50 mm per irrigation was applied when soil water content was less than 80 of field water holding capacity during the whole rice growth period the irrigation amount of flooded and non flooded irrigation methods were 800 1000 mm and 300 500 mm respectively the rice crop was manually harvested in late october the plot size was 30 m2 isolated by ridges and plastic film cover to prevent water and fertilizer flow to adjacent plots all treatments were applied at the same rate of 135 kg n ha 1 as urea 47 kg p2o5 ha 1 as calcium superphosphate and 67 5 kg k2o ha 1 as potassium chloride the amount of organic c that was annually going to soils was calculated based on the sum of c input from paddy straw stubble roots and rhizosphere depositions table 1 paddy straw stubble or root c inputs into the soils were calculated by multiplying the biomass amount of paddy straw stubble or roots by their respective c concentration rice rhizodeposition c input was computed as 28 of root biomass liu et al 2019 2 3 sampling and measurement rice grain yield was calculated on 14 moisture content basis after manually harvesting each plot five soil samples per plot were collected from the 0 10 cm and 10 20 cm layer in may 2016 the samples were mixed to form a composite soil sample the air dried samples were sieved 2 mm and ground further to pass through a 0 25 mm sieve for determination of toc and tn toc was determined by oxidation with k2cr2o7 and by titration with ferrous ammonium sulphate walkley and black 1934 soil tn was measured using the kjeldahl method after h2so4 digestion bremner 1996 particulate organic c was separated from 2 mm soil following the procedure of cambardella and elliott 1992 ten grams of air dried soil was dispersed in 30 ml of sodium hexametaphosphate 5 g l 1 by shaking on a reciprocating shaker 100 r min 1 for 18 h the soil suspension was poured over a 53 μm sieve using a steady flow of distilled water to ensure separation all materials remaining on the sieve were washed into a dry dish and then oven dried at 60 c for 48 h weighed and ground in order to measure the c content potassium permanganate oxidizable c was determined as described by blair et al 1995 soil samples containing approximately 15 mg c were oxidized with 25 ml of 333 mm kmno4 which were shaken for 1 h after shaking the tubes were centrifuged for 5 min the supernatants were diluted and the absorbance was measured at 565 nm the change of kmno4 concentration was used to estimate the amount of c oxidized the carbon management index cmi and its components were calculated based on the method of blair et al 1995 which is described below 1 cmi cpi li 100 where cpi is the carbon pool index and li is the lability index the cpi and li are determined as follows 2 cpi toc content in sample soil toc content in reference soil 3 li l in sample soil l in reference soil where l refers to the c lability which is determined as follows 4 l kmno4 c content toc content kmno4 c content in this study the flooding cultivation method without rice straw mulching was used as a reference for the calculation of cmi 2 4 statistical analysis data collected were analyzed using a two way analysis of variance anova with statistica software version 5 5 the contribution of each variation source is calculated based on the ratio of the sum of squares of deviations ss of each factor to the total ss differences were considered significant at p 0 05 using duncan multiple range test 3 results 3 1 toc and tn the water and straw management methods respectively accounted for 54 and 28 of the variation in toc content at a depth of 0 10 cm however no significant differences were recorded at 10 20 cm soil depth table 2 the mean toc content across both straw management treatments at 0 10 cm was 17 4 higher in the flooding cultivation than that in the non flooded treatment table 3 between the two straw management methods rice straw mulching resulted in 11 9 higher toc content than rice straw removal at 0 10 cm soil depth table 3 overall the combined flooding cultivation and straw mulching fc sm method showed the highest toc content 21 2 g kg 1 the combined non flooded cultivation and straw mulching nfc sm treatment produced a similar toc content compared to the flooding cultivation with straw removal fc sr treatment after 15 years soil tn content was significantly affected by straw management methods table 2 compared to the straw removal treatment rice straw mulching exhibited 12 5 higher tn content at 0 10 cm under flooding conditions and 15 4 higher tn content at 10 20 cm under non flooded conditions after 15 years 3 2 poc significant poc content responses to water regimes and straw management methods were recorded at 0 10 cm accounting for 38 and 50 variations respectively table 2 compared to the straw management methods water regimes showed a higher contribution 84 to the poc content at 10 20 cm table 2 the poc content was 11 1 higher at 0 10 cm and 15 8 higher at 10 20 cm under flooding condition than under non flooded condition when averaged across two straw management methods fig 2 poc contents were significantly higher in the rice straw mulching treatment than without rice straw mulching at 0 10 cm however no differences were recorded between the two straw management methods at 10 20 cm 3 3 kmno4 c both water regimes and straw management methods influenced kmno4 c content at 0 10 cm soil layer at deeper soil depth 10 20 cm water regimes showed dominant effect on kmno4 c content accounting for 60 of the variation table 2 the kmno4 c content was significantly higher under flooding conditions than under non flooded conditions across the two straw management methods in flooding conditions straw mulching resulted in 26 7 higher kmno4 c content than in straw removal at 0 10 cm soil layer fig 3 correspondingly straw mulching increased the kmno4 c content at 0 10 cm by 6 8 compared to straw removal under non flooded conditions fig 3 3 4 cmi both water regimes and straw management methods significantly influenced the cmi values accounting for 55 and 20 variations respectively at 0 10 cm and 67 and 20 variations respectively at 10 20 cm soil layer table 2 flooding cultivation increased the cmi value by 34 9 at 0 10 cm and 17 6 at 10 20 cm as compared to non flooded cultivation when averaged across the two straw management methods table 4 similarly straw mulching resulted in comparable or higher cmi values than straw removal irrespective of irrigation regimes in both soil depths 3 5 rice grain yield rice grain yields varied greatly under different treatments during the first seven years and then remained relatively stable in the subsequent eight years fig 4 over the total 15 years the ranking of rice grain yields followed the sequence of fc sm nfc sm fc sr nfc sr fig 4 the fc sm and nfc sm treatments increased 15 year average rice grain yields by 6 9 and 3 4 respectively compared to the nfc sr treatment fig 4 4 discussion 4 1 toc and tn long term flooding cultivation significantly improved the toc content compared with non flooded cultivation table 3 a possible explanation is that waterlogged conditions kept the soil in a reduced state and led to a lower soil temperature which in turn decreased soc decomposition another possible reason is that larger inputs of stubble and root residues returned to the soil as a result of higher crop productivity under flooding conditions yang et al 2012 however fan et al 2005 found that non flooded cultivation led to a similar toc content compared to the traditional flooding in a five year rice wheat rotation system this observation was probably due to the fact that non flooded conditions increased the amount and transferred proportion of c remaining underground as rhizodeposition tian et al 2013c in this study straw mulching increased both toc and tn contents at 0 10 cm soil layer as compared to straw removal this was mainly attributed to the increase in carbon and nitrogen inputs resulting from straw return however yang et al 2012 found that straw incorporation did not enhance toc content in a 20 year field experiment the inconsistent findings are possibly due to the variations in straw return rate soil types and climate conditions at deeper soil layer 10 20 cm no difference was observed in toc content suggesting that straw residue mulch mainly improved total soc in the surface soil this observation was consistent with the results from li et al 2012 and mi et al 2016 correspondingly higher tn content in the deeper soil depth could be explained by the increased mineralization of crop biomass that caused more leaching of labile n from the soil profile 4 2 soil labile organic c fractions labile soc fractions including poc and kmno4 c were significantly influenced by water regimes and straw management table 2 the trends in the labile soc fractions reflect that of the total soc in the surface soil indicating that total som was a major determinant of the labile som fractions additionally water regimes and straw managements influenced both quantity and quality of poc and kmno4 c in this study straw management showed dominant effects on poc the main reason was that poc was composed of decomposing plant and animal residues the increase in poc may reflect higher c input from straw stubble and root residues poc is regarded as the slow pool of soc with an intermediate turnover time between the active and passive pools parton et al 1987 thus poc may be of greater importance in defining soc turnover yang et al 2005 in a reservoir of nutrients higher poc content may accelerate soc turnover and influence soil nutrient cycling and biological productivity liebig et al 2002 the kmno4 c content reflects less recalcitrant and relatively younger organic compounds rudrappa et al 2006 higher kmno4 c content under straw mulching indicated larger crop residue input in addition the result showed that flooding cultivation had greater kmno4 c content than the non flooded conditions tian et al 2013c found that non flooded conditions showed higher roots and rhizomicrobial respiration than the flooded treatment labile soc fractions are major energy sources for microorganisms thus we speculated that non flooded cultivation might increase the microbial activity and labile soc fraction loss however in this study we have not measured the microbial c and dissolved organic c contents the related inferences need to be validated in future studies cmi is a sensitive tool to evaluate soil quality in different management practices we found greater cpi and cmi values in flooding and straw mulching treatments however no differences in li were recorded between both water regimes and straw management method this result indicated that cpi contributed to the formation of more stable organic compounds that collectively act as a soil reservoir sousa et al 2012 tian et al 2013b 5 conclusion the toc and labile soc fractions in the surface soil were significantly influenced by water regimes and straw management water regimes had greater effects on toc and kmno4 c than did straw management however at deeper soil depth labile soc fractions were only affected by water regimes compared to the non flooded conditions flooding cultivation significantly improved total soc content at 0 10 cm and labile soc fractions at 0 20 cm the higher cmi values in flooding condition and straw mulch were attributed to the increase in cpi which contributed to the formation of more stable organic compounds that collectively act as a soil reservoir the combined non flooded cultivation and straw mulching method nfc sm not only produced a similar 15 year average rice grain yield but also saved 50 amount of irrigation water compared to the traditional flooding cultivation with straw removal treatment fc sr in addition there was no significant difference in toc content between the two management practices after 15 years our result suggested that a combination of non flooded cultivation and straw mulching could be an ideal strategy to maintain agroecosystem productivity acknowledgements this research was financed by the national key research and

methods water regimes showed a higher contribution 84 to the poc content at 10 20 cm table 2 the poc content was 11 1 higher at 0 10 cm and 15 8 higher at 10 20 cm under flooding condition than under non flooded condition when averaged across two straw management methods fig 2 poc contents were significantly higher in the rice straw mulching treatment than without rice straw mulching at 0 10 cm however no differences were recorded between the two straw management methods at 10 20 cm 3 3 kmno4 c both water regimes and straw management methods influenced kmno4 c content at 0 10 cm soil layer at deeper soil depth 10 20 cm water regimes showed dominant effect on kmno4 c content accounting for 60 of the variation table 2 the kmno4 c content was significantly higher under flooding conditions than under non flooded conditions across the two straw management methods in flooding conditions straw mulching resulted in 26 7 higher kmno4 c content than in straw removal at 0 10 cm soil layer fig 3 correspondingly straw mulching increased the kmno4 c content at 0 10 cm by 6 8 compared to straw removal under non flooded conditions fig 3 3 4 cmi both water regimes and straw management methods significantly influenced the cmi values accounting for 55 and 20 variations respectively at 0 10 cm and 67 and 20 variations respectively at 10 20 cm soil layer table 2 flooding cultivation increased the cmi value by 34 9 at 0 10 cm and 17 6 at 10 20 cm as compared to non flooded cultivation when averaged across the two straw management methods table 4 similarly straw mulching resulted in comparable or higher cmi values than straw removal irrespective of irrigation regimes in both soil depths 3 5 rice grain yield rice grain yields varied greatly under different treatments during the first seven years and then remained relatively stable in the subsequent eight years fig 4 over the total 15 years the ranking of rice grain yields followed the sequence of fc sm nfc sm fc sr nfc sr fig 4 the fc sm and nfc sm treatments increased 15 year average rice grain yields by 6 9 and 3 4 respectively compared to the nfc sr treatment fig 4 4 discussion 4 1 toc and tn long term flooding cultivation significantly improved the toc content compared with non flooded cultivation table 3 a possible explanation is that waterlogged conditions kept the soil in a reduced state and led to a lower soil temperature which in turn decreased soc decomposition another possible reason is that larger inputs of stubble and root residues returned to the soil as a result of higher crop productivity under flooding conditions yang et al 2012 however fan et al 2005 found that non flooded cultivation led to a similar toc content compared to the traditional flooding in a five year rice wheat rotation system this observation was probably due to the fact that non flooded conditions increased the amount and transferred proportion of c remaining underground as rhizodeposition tian et al 2013c in this study straw mulching increased both toc and tn contents at 0 10 cm soil layer as compared to straw removal this was mainly attributed to the increase in carbon and nitrogen inputs resulting from straw return however yang et al 2012 found that straw incorporation did not enhance toc content in a 20 year field experiment the inconsistent findings are possibly due to the variations in straw return rate soil types and climate conditions at deeper soil layer 10 20 cm no difference was observed in toc content suggesting that straw residue mulch mainly improved total soc in the surface soil this observation was consistent with the results from li et al 2012 and mi et al 2016 correspondingly higher tn content in the deeper soil depth could be explained by the increased mineralization of crop biomass that caused more leaching of labile n from the soil profile 4 2 soil labile organic c fractions labile soc fractions including poc and kmno4 c were significantly influenced by water regimes and straw management table 2 the trends in the labile soc fractions reflect that of the total soc in the surface soil indicating that total som was a major determinant of the labile som fractions additionally water regimes and straw managements influenced both quantity and quality of poc and kmno4 c in this study straw management showed dominant effects on poc the main reason was that poc was composed of decomposing plant and animal residues the increase in poc may reflect higher c input from straw stubble and root residues poc is regarded as the slow pool of soc with an intermediate turnover time between the active and passive pools parton et al 1987 thus poc may be of greater importance in defining soc turnover yang et al 2005 in a reservoir of nutrients higher poc content may accelerate soc turnover and influence soil nutrient cycling and biological productivity liebig et al 2002 the kmno4 c content reflects less recalcitrant and relatively younger organic compounds rudrappa et al 2006 higher kmno4 c content under straw mulching indicated larger crop residue input in addition the result showed that flooding cultivation had greater kmno4 c content than the non flooded conditions tian et al 2013c found that non flooded conditions showed higher roots and rhizomicrobial respiration than the flooded treatment labile soc fractions are major energy sources for microorganisms thus we speculated that non flooded cultivation might increase the microbial activity and labile soc fraction loss however in this study we have not measured the microbial c and dissolved organic c contents the related inferences need to be validated in future studies cmi is a sensitive tool to evaluate soil quality in different management practices we found greater cpi and cmi values in flooding and straw mulching treatments however no differences in li were recorded between both water regimes and straw management method this result indicated that cpi contributed to the formation of more stable organic compounds that collectively act as a soil reservoir sousa et al 2012 tian et al 2013b 5 conclusion the toc and labile soc fractions in the surface soil were significantly influenced by water regimes and straw management water regimes had greater effects on toc and kmno4 c than did straw management however at deeper soil depth labile soc fractions were only affected by water regimes compared to the non flooded conditions flooding cultivation significantly improved total soc content at 0 10 cm and labile soc fractions at 0 20 cm the higher cmi values in flooding condition and straw mulch were attributed to the increase in cpi which contributed to the formation of more stable organic compounds that collectively act as a soil reservoir the combined non flooded cultivation and straw mulching method nfc sm not only produced a similar 15 year average rice grain yield but also saved 50 amount of irrigation water compared to the traditional flooding cultivation with straw removal treatment fc sr in addition there was no significant difference in toc content between the two management practices after 15 years our result suggested that a combination of non flooded cultivation and straw mulching could be an ideal strategy to maintain agroecosystem productivity acknowledgements this research was financed by the national key research and

10892,agriculture water resources are expected to decline due to increasing water demand and ongoing climate change in this context water saving irrigation techniques such as partial root zone drying prd and deficit irrigation di were assessed under glasshouse conditions on potato cultivar mondial four irrigation levels were applied 50 70 80 and 100 of field capacity during 2016 and 2017 growing seasons the results showed that the yield penalty with prd was similar to that caused by di nevertheless prd plants had higher number of stems and were shorter than di plants sugar and protein contents of tubers gradually decreased with water restriction however remained higher in prd than di tubers in contrast the amounts of polyphenols and antioxidants increased in tubers with decreasing irrigation levels untargeted metabolite analysis revealed higher metabolite content of prd than di tubers with less decrease in glucose and fructose concentrations and with double amount of mannitol transcript level of key genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism was elevated at 20 water saving in prd tubers but not in di tubers we assumed that the detected changes in tubers reflect better adaptation of plants to water saving irrigation under prd than di keywords antioxidant activity metabolite polyphenol protein sugar tuber 1 introduction water is an essential resource it plays a central and critical role in all aspects of life it is the basic element of any biological function and it is a precious resource limited and vulnerable sustainable management of this resource requires a holistic approach that integrates rational use climate change is expected to put additional stress on water supplies making water management even more complex and difficult arnell 2004 bates et al 2008 deficit irrigation di is a promising method consisting in reducing water inputs compared to a maximum level of crop so that the stress imposed does not significantly affect yield costa et al 2007 geerts and raes 2009 the objective of this irrigation method is to control vegetative growth and improve irrigation water use efficiency iwue partial root zone drying known as prd is an evolution of di and is one of the promising techniques for saving irrigation water dodd et al 2015 many studies have shown the advantage of prd by reducing water input by 30 50 without penalizing yield or even having a positive effect on quality du et al 2008 for example showed in an experimental vineyard study under arid conditions that prd treatment improved iwue and increased the number of grapes vitamin c concentration and maturity index zegbe and behboudian 2008 applied prd in humid climate on apple trees and showed that it did not adversely affect yield and fruit quality but improved iwue by 20 similar results were reported by dos santos et al 2003 on the grapevine when moderate water stress inhibited vegetative growth indeed they argued that vines and fruit trees are the most suited to the prd strategy knowing that the responses were variable depending on the species variety and climatic conditions nevertheless prd could be successfully applied also to tomato and impacted bioactive compounds and antioxidant activity casa and rouphael 2014 sun et al 2014a bogale et al 2016 prd studies in potato goes back to 2005 when saeed et al 2005 reported that prd treatment modifies shoot growth reduces plant leaf area and increases iwue andersen et al 2008 conducted experiments with cv folva in outdoor rain protected lysimeter facilities in three soil types loam sandy loam and coarse sand in prd plants received 70 of those plants which were irrigated to field capacity fc when plants were fully irrigated till tuber bulking the total yield was essentially the same in prd and fc prd during the tuber initiation stage of growth however decreased the yield and quality of tubers several studies indicate that prd irrigation may cause not only an increase of iwue but also higher nitrogen use efficiency shahnazari et al 2008a wang et al 2009 jensen et al 2010 ahmadi et al 2011 moreover prd results in a slight reduction in soluble sugar concentration and an increase in starch nitrogen and antioxidant contents of tubers jovanovic et al 2010 nevertheless there is an inconsistency on the effects of the prd on potato yield in the literature in contrast to shahnazari et al 2007 testing cv folva in coarse textured meltwater sand brocic et al 2009 detected a reduced yield of cv liseta grown in silty clay by comparing fc to 70 prd an explanation for inconsistent results in terms of the effect of prd on tuber yield was given by ahmadi et al 2010 who showed that the interaction between irrigation treatments and soil textures was significant and water saving irrigations were not recommended in loamy sand soil due to considerable loss 28 in yield with prd receiving 65 of fc furthermore by growing cv may queen in experimental plots under plastic rainout shelters it was concluded that early season prd treatment for eight weeks rather than the whole season treatment should be applied xu et al 2011 a similar result was obtained by growing the potato cv unica in sandy loam in that study it was found that an early prd initiated six weeks after planting with a watering level equivalent to even 50 of fc increased iwue with no yield reduction relative to fc yactayo et al 2013 efficiency of prd however is also cultivar dependent as it was detected in the case of agria and ramos ahmadi et al 2016 another critical factor in terms of yield might be the correct choice of duration of wet dry cycling especially in arid areas as pointed out by zin el abedin et al 2017 the above cited publications demonstrated that application of prd in potatoes is possible but it is critical to identify the conditions where this method can be effective and understand the physiological responses behind adaptation of potato to these conditions the best way of testing plants responses to prd is under controlled conditions in a greenhouse on plants with a split root system liu et al 2006 irrigated one half of the root system of cv folva for nine days and found that the xylem sap abscisic acid aba concentration increased exponentially with decreasing root water potential later it was demonstrated that hprd two lateral root compartments one dry the other wet better triggers a long distance aba signal than vprd upper root compartment dry lower compartment wet puértolas et al 2015 it was also shown that compared to di prd led to modulating stomatal morphology and significantly enhanced plant nitrogen content in relation to di and increased root to shoot ratio yan et al 2012 sun et al 2013 2014b 2015 liu et al 2015 ramírez et al 2014 found an increase in chlorophyll content of prd treated leaves and concluded that chlorophyll concentration in leaves is an indicator of potato tuber yield in water shortage conditions in morocco as water resources are constantly worsening water saving is an essential axis of the new agricultural strategy in line with this strategy the aims of our work were i to assess the feasibility of water saving irrigation techniques on potato cv mondial a variety with very high yield potential under glasshouse conditions ii to elucidate the differential effects of prd and di on growth parameters and the main quality traits of tubers iii and to study the effects of water saving irrigation on the metabolite profile and gene expression in tubers 2 material and methods 2 1 plant material and growth conditions the experiments were carried out during the growing seasons of 2016 and 2017 in a glasshouse of the national agricultural research institute in tangier northern morocco certified seedlings of solanum tuberosum l cv mondial from nak nederland with uniform size 35 55 mm in diameter were planted in normal and separated pots 25 cm diameter and 30 cm height filled with 2 3 of sandy soil and 1 3 of an organic substrate the sandy soil originated from loukkos region called r mel is inorganic and poor in nitrogen its texture is sandy with 80 5 11 and 8 5 of sand silt and clay respectively the substrate used contained the npk fertilizer 14 10 18 1 5 kg m3 with a ph of 5 5 6 5 and electrical conductivity of 40 ms m 25 the experiments were carried out in a clinvertec glasshouse ritec riegos y tecnología s l águilas murcia spain with controlled heating and humidification systems air recirculation co2 supply cooling system thermal screens and shade control the temperature inside the glasshouse was fixed between 24 and 25 c during the cultivation period from march to june and the relative humidity between 60 and 70 2 2 experimental design and irrigation treatments the experiment was setup in a randomized complete block design rcbd with two factors irrigation method and irrigation amount the first factor had two levels either deficit irrigation di or partial root zone drying prd while the second factor had four levels 50 70 80 or 100 of the field capacity fc fc of the mixed soil 2 3 of sandy soil and 1 3 of organic substrate was determined by gravimetric method before planting two control pots in each block were watered until the soil was saturated after free drainage had stopped the pots were weighted to obtain the volumetric water retained by the soil for each pot the volumetric soil moisture content θv at fc was 25 1 on the mass basis permanent wilting point was estimated to be 11 and available water 14 1 the factorial arrangement of the levels of the two mentioned factors lead to eight treatments each one of them was replicated in four blocks in total there were 2 4x4 32 experimental units each unit comprised six plants one plant pot receiving the same and a unique one of the eight treatments however for the statistical data analyses the measurements over the 6 plants were averaged such that there would be only one observation per experimental unit pots were irrigated equally 30 days after planting at fc the soil moisture content was measured gravimetrically by weighting each pot and replacing the individual loss of water to maintain the original weight shifting of irrigation in prd treatments was done empirically jensen et al 2010 depending on pots evapotranspiration di plants were irrigated every second or fourth day while prd plants were watered at alternating sites daily or every second day the same amount of water supplied to di treatments was split twice to prd treatments on either two sides of the root system receiving each compartment the half amount of water supplied to di plants in each irrigation event prd pots were separated by a rigid and impermeable pvc plate to avoid the infiltration of water from the watered compartment to the dry one 2 3 calculation of irrigation water use efficiency iwue at final harvest tubers were collected and the tuber biomass was determined for each treatment iwue g l was calculated by dividing the fresh weight of tubers g plant by the amount of water l plant used during treatment period one month after planting to two weeks before physiological maturity 2 4 dry weight and ash content determination dry matter and water content were determined by the aoac 934 06 official method by vacuum oven three grams of potato sample was placed in a clean empty and dry moisture can the moisture can containing the sample was placed in the drying vacuum oven isco lincoln ne usa that was set at 70 c for more than 8 h the dry weight dw in was determined by the formula given as

oven the crucible containing the sample was placed in an ash oven at 525 c 10 c for 3 h when the ashing was complete the weight of the sample was measured again the ash content ac in was determined by the following formula ac w2 w1 100 where w2 is weight of the remaining sample and w1 is weight of the original sample 2 5 tuber quality trait analysis the total sugar content of 10 g of tubers was

sugars protein content of tubers was calculated from the total nitrogen content of 1 g tubers determined by the kjeldahl method this method consists of digestion of samples in sulfuric acid with a catalyst kjeldahl tablets which results in conversion of nitrogen to ammonia distillation of the ammonia into a trapping solution 1 boric acid and quantification of the ammonia by titration with a

treatment data were analyzed using the glm of three way analysis of variance anova the three factors were irrigation method irrigation amount and block this was the case for response variables measured during 2016 season however for the other response variables the experiment was repeated during two growing seasons 2016 and 2017 therefore an analysis of combined experiments over years dixon et al 2018 was done including the growing season as an additional factor leading to a four way anova the effects of the two main factors irrigation method and irrigation amount were considered fixed since we have only two years we considered the year effect as fixed vargas et al 2018 while the block effect was considered random the combination of fixed as well as random effects leads to a mixed model yang 2010 data were analyzed using the mixed procedure of sas version 9 1 3 sas institute cary nc usa using the reml estimation method and the kenward roger approximation for computing the degrees of freedom of the denominator for eventually heterogeneous variances littell et al 2006 normality of data was checked using the shapiro wilk test correlation analysis was performed by pearson s method 3 results 3 1 effects of prd and di on yield iwue and growth parameters effects of prd and di on cv mondial grown in glasshouse under well controlled conditions in pots were compared in two seasons 2016 and 2017 tuber yields per plant are presented in fig 1 a the yield ranged from 120 g plant for di 50 to 202 g plant for prd at 100 of fc the tuber yield was reduced by around 40 when the water supply was restricted to 50 the statistical analysis showed significant differences in tuber yield per plant between 50 and 70 and between 80 and 100 water treatments but not between 70 and 80 supplementary table 1 the iwue was significantly higher at 70 and 50 of fc than under well watered conditions fig 1b the highest iwue values were found for prd 50 with an average of 50 6 g l and the lowest values were found in fc treatments with an average of 37 9 g l and 38 8 g l for di 100 and prd 100 respectively in all treatments the iwue of prd plants was slightly higher but not significantly different from di plants supplementary table 1 the potato plants growth was assessed as tuber number per plant number of stems per plant plant height total dry weight and ash content of tubers table 1 presents the mean data of these growth parameters measured in 2016 we found that the number of tubers per plant was not influenced by water withdrawal as it ranged from 12 to 14 tubers per plant in each treatment thus after one month of normal irrigation the water restriction did not impact the tuber number per plant there were no significant differences either in number of stems per plant or plant height between the different irrigation levels however the prd plants had a greater number of stems but were shorter than di plants even at 100 irrigation level suggesting that the alternate irrigation of root system influences plant growth the dry weight dw and ash content of tubers as a of fresh weight decreased with the severity of water withdrawal with similar tendency in prd and di however with significant differences in ash content between the two water saving irrigation strategies 3 2 effects of prd and di on sugar protein polyphenol and antioxidant content of tubers effects of prd and di on quality traits were studied both in 2016 and 2017 seasons it was found that the sugar and protein content of tubers gradually decreased with lowering the level of irrigation fig 2 a and b for all treatments however the sugar and protein content of prd tubers was higher than that of the di tubers the only exception was in the sugar contents of tubers developed at 50 of fc which were equally low independent of the irrigation strategy used supplementary table 2 in contrast to sugar and protein contents the amounts of polyphenols and antioxidants in tubers increased with decreasing irrigation levels fig 2c and d no substantial difference between the effect of prd and di in polyphenol content of tubers was detected except at 80 of fc where 20 more polyphenols were found in prd than in di tubers the antioxidant activity aa of prd tubers however was significantly higher in all treatments supplementary table 2 3 3 correlation analysis table 2 presents the correlation matrix for yield iwue dw ash polyphenol aa protein and sugar contents there were significant and positive correlations between tuber yield dw aa protein and sugars in addition significant and positive correlations were detected between iwue polyphenol concentration and aa while iwue correlated negatively with dw ash protein and sugar contents ash content and aa showed strong and negative correlation r 0 890 whereas protein and total sugars correlated positively r 0 704 total polyphenols did not correlate with aa r 0 111 3 4 effects of prd and di on metabolite composition of tubers metabolite composition of tubers was tested from the experiment performed in 2016 after harvest the tubers were stored at 4 c for 3 months an untargeted metabolite analysis was performed by gc ms based on mass spectra and authentic standards 33 metabolites were identified these included mainly sugars amino acids and organic acids glucose sucrose fructose and citric acid were present in the largest amounts supplementary table 3 the heat map presented in fig 3 a shows that the water withdrawal increased the concentrations of several metabolites and this was more pronounced in prd than in di treatments there were even some differences between the prd 100 and di 100 tubers e g in malic acid content suggesting that alternate watering of roots is sensed by the plant and manifested in a mild alteration of tuber metabolism the dendrogram in fig 3b highlights the similarity between di 100 and prd 80 tubers indicating that using alternate irrigation a very similar metabolite constitution as in di 100 tubers can be achieved with less water in line with the decrease in total sugar content the concentration of glucose and fructose was lower in tubers of less watered plants than in tubers of fc plants and higher in prd tubers than in di tubers fig 4 a and b interestingly the concentration of mannitol in prd tubers was approximately double than in di tubers under each condition fig 4c water withdrawal until 70 did not change the proline content of tubers however a twofold increase was detected in proline content when the soil water loss reached 50 fig 4d a detailed statistical analysis is presented in the supplementary table 4 3 5 effects of prd and di on gene expression since treatment dependent significant differences in sugar and proline content of tubers were detected the expression of some genes characteristic for sugar and proline metabolism was tested these genes included sucrose transporter sut4 sucrose synthase susy adp glucose pyrophosphorylase agpase granule bound starch synthase gbss mannitol dehydrogenase mad fumarase fumase and δ1 pyrroline 5 carboxylate synthase p5cs nevertheless none of them showed changes in expression correlating with sugar or proline content fig 4 5 and supplementary fig 1 although a highly elevated level of sut4 susy gbss and mad expression and with less extent but also of agpase and fumase expression was detected in prd 80 tubers fig 5 and supplementary fig 1 this observation suggests that the molecular physiology of prd 80 plants differs from the others producing tubers with elevated expression of some key genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism when stored for three months at 4 c 4 discussion 4 1 tuber yield iwue and growth parameters responses to prd and di potato solanum tuberosum l is considered a water stress sensitive crop nevertheless many authors found that the effects of water stress depend on the growth stage of the crop iqbal et al 1999 reported that the stress imposed during the early development stage of potato might cause severe yield reduction and the stress applied during the ripening stage increases iwue without adverse effect on yield although our treatments were applied after tuber initiation a significant decrease in tuber yield was detected even by water reduction of 20 fig 1a in another study reported by jensen et al 2010 30 was found to be the water saving limit compared to fc however their experiment was carried out under field conditions in a different soil type and with a different potato variety our data showed that all restricted water supply evoked higher iwue than the control regardless of irrigation strategy used fig 1b in all treatments and for the same amount of water supply the iwue of prd plants were slightly higher but not significantly different from di plants similar results were reported by yactayo et al 2009 for potted potato grown under greenhouse conditions the irrigation treatments started four weeks after planting the lack of differences in number of tubers per plant in response to irrigation level or irrigation strategies supports the hypothesis that the tuber initiation was completed before the application of treatments this agrees with several authors who reported that initiation of tubers usually begins after plant emergence and is thought to be complete within two three weeks after that event o brien et al 1998 other authors suggested that prd should be started five six weeks after tuber initiation shahnazari et al 2008b saeed et al 2008 yactayo et al 2013 our results support the theory that water saving irrigation should start after the end of tuber initiation to avoid yield decrease which could be a consequence of the reduction in tuber number per plant for normal growth and development potato needs regular water supply reduction in water or deficit irrigation leads to modifications in many morphophysiological traits growth parameters such as the number of stems per plant plant height dw and ash content are commonly dependent on the amount of water available in the soil in this study there were significant differences in plant height between prd and di when comparing the number per stems per plant for the same irrigation level we found higher number of stems in prd than in di plants suggesting that alternate irrigation of root system influences plant growth by promoting stem initiation and reducing plant height 4 2 quality of tubers under prd and di potato tuber dw is mainly constituted by starch and there are small quantities of sugars fiber protein and ash dw often ranges from 16 to 28 depending on the development stages of the crop reaching it maximum towards the end of the crop growth water stress in potato tends to improve quality of chips due to the higher percentage of tuber dw which makes the chips appropriate for the industry jensen et al 2000 kumar et al 2003 in our experiment the dw decreased with the severity of water restriction with similar tendency in prd and di and ranged from 18 5 for stressed plants di 50 to 22 7 for well watered plants di 100 similar results were reported by deblonde et al 1999 on six potato cultivars grown under temperate climate conditions and three irrigation treatments they showed that tuber dw was significantly reduced under drought treatment in comparison with fc levy 1983 and later schafleitner 2009 found that tuber dw is cultivar dependent and is a trait of adaptation of potato to water stress total sugars mainly sucrose glucose and fructose are important factors affecting quality in potatoes especially color of processed products smith 1987 in tubers they are conditioned by several parameters which include variety the environmental conditions crop management especially irrigation and several post harvest factors like storage period and temperature kumar et al 2004 there are divergent opinions on the impact of water stress on sugars accumulation in potatoes in this study it was found that the sugar content of tubers particularly glucose and fructose contents gradually decreased with lowering the water supply figs 3a 4 a and b these results were consistent with those found by wegener et al 2017 who reported that drought stressed tubers presented lower concentration of total sugars and also glucose and fructose than the well watered control tubers in contrast eldredge et al 1996 demonstrated that drought stress increases the sugar content in tubers the contradiction was solved by the observation of andré et al 2009 and muttucumaru et al 2015 who found that the different genotypes were affected in dissimilar fashion by the same treatment indicating that there is no single unifying potato tuber drought stress response for all treatments the sugar content including glucose and fructose contents was higher in prd than in di tubers the only exception was in the total sugar contents of tubers developed at 50 of fc which were equally low independent of the irrigation strategy used this increase in sugars under prd compared to di was also observed by battilani et al 2014 in one year on potato grown under field conditions in a sub humid area however not in another year which was particularly dry potato tuber proteins are considered of important nutritional value knorr 1978 in our study the protein content ranged from 0 57 to 3 13 while van niekerk 2015 reported 1 49 in mondial tubers nevertheless water stress and irrigation management play an important role in the determination of protein content in potato tubers drought stress generally decreases plant nitrogen concentration he and dijkstra 2014 our results are consistent with this observation as we showed that protein contents of tubers gradually decreased with lowering the level of irrigation fig 2b in addition tubers from prd treatments presented higher protein content compared to di for all irrigation levels similar results were reported by wang et al 2009 and sun et al 2013 who demonstrated that prd plants grown in pots had significantly higher nitrogen contents in tubers compared to di plants this finding was confirmed also for potato plants grown under field conditions jovanovic et al 2010 ahmadi et al 2016 the rise in nitrogen uptake under prd treatments may be explained either by the increase in nitrogen mineralization rate due to the high frequency of wetting drying cycles jensen et al 2010 wang et al 2010 sun et al 2013 or by an increase in root nitrogen absorption hu et al 2009 polyphenols represent a large family of plant secondary metabolites mainly hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives and flavonoids implicated in the prevention of various diseases such as cancers and cardiovascular diseases evers and deußer 2012 in this study we examined the effect of prd and di on the total polyphenols of potato tubers the results obtained fig 2c showed a significant increase in polyphenol content in response to water restriction our results are similar to those obtained by hamouz et al 2010 who reported higher total polyphenol contents in potatoes grown under drought and extreme temperatures highly cultivar dependent variations of polyphenol content were observed by andré et al 2009 who proposed that the altered sucrose flux induced by the drought stress is partly responsible for the changes in expression of genes involved in polyphenol synthesis water stress leads to increased accumulation of ros to detoxify these reactive molecules plants can intrinsically develop different types of antioxidants reducing oxidative damage and conferring drought tolerance they have both non enzymatic antioxidants such as carotenoid flavonoids α tocopherol ascorbic acid and glutathione and enzymatic antioxidants such as catalase and peroxidase choudhury et al 2017 antioxidant capacity depends on the variety environmental growth conditions crop management and post harvest storage conditions dumas et al 2003 previous work highlighted that potato responses to drought stress are complex with levels of antioxidants showing increases decreases or remaining stable depending on the genotype and kind of antioxidant andré et al 2009 our data presented in fig 2d show a clear effect of water stress and irrigation strategy on aa for each irrigation level aa was significantly higher in water stressed tubers and elevated under prd compared to di similar results were obtained by jovanovic et al 2010 from a field experiment on potato showing that prd treatment increased aa in potato tubers they presumed that the increased aa was due to an increase of total phenolic content though we also measured the total phenolic content of tubers we did not detect significant correlation between aa and phenolics table 2 therefore in our case the high aa found under prd could not be explained just by an increase in phenolics 4 3 metabolites and gene expression under prd and di one of the novelties of our findings was the detection of double amount of mannitol in prd than in di tubers irrespective of soil water content mannitol is an osmoprotectant providing salt osmotic and oxidative stress tolerance to plants and is proposed to have a role s in protecting cells and cellular structures against damage by ros patel and williamson 2016 the difference in mannitol level and in concentration of some other metabolites fig 3a and 4c as well as the slight but statistically significant differences in sugar protein and aa levels fig 2a b d and supplementary table 2 indicate that alternate watering of root system is sensed by the plant even at 100 of fc proline like mannitol has important roles in adaptation to osmotic and dehydration stresses and also in redox control fichman et al 2015 however unlike mannitol that had an elevated level only in prd tubers fig 4c proline concentration was increased in both prd and di tubers however only at 50 of fc fig 4d 50 soil water loss is a strong stress for plants irrespective of the way of irrigation and that is reflected in higher proline concentration of tubers the bifunctional enzyme p5cs catalyzes the first two steps of proline synthesis fichman et al 2015 nevertheless expression of p5cs like that of the genes encoding enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism was not in line with the level of corresponding metabolite it is very likely that this is due to the three months storage of tubers at 4 c that might resulted in degradation of mrnas synthesized in the growing stage while due to the very low activity of transcription factors at 4 c only a low number of new mrnas could be generated despite of the presumed low activity of transcription factors large amounts of mrnas derived from sut4 susy gbss and mad were detected in prd 80 tubers and also agpase and fumase expression was elevated in them to some extent fig 5 this observation together with the general picture presented in fig 3a on the elevated level of metabolites in prd 80 tubers compared to di 80 tubers suggests that there were more changes in prd 80 than in di 80 plants compared to fc 100 plants both at transcriptome and metabolome levels 5 conclusions in conclusion our results showed that the yield penalty with partial root zone drying prd was similar to that caused by deficit irrigation di the irrigation water use efficiency iwue was higher for all restricted water treatments compared to control while no substantial differences in iwue between prd and di occurred regardless of the irrigation strategy used water restriction decreased tuber dry weight sugar and protein contents however it increased the amount of polyphenols and the antioxidant activity our results revealed that prd influences plant growth by promoting stem initiation and reducing plant height another important finding of the present work is the detection of double amount of an osmoprotectant mannitol in prd tubers irrespective of water shortage level the elevated concentration of mannitol and some other metabolites as well as the slight but statistically significant differences in sugar protein and antioxidant activity levels indicate that alternate watering of root system induces important changes at metabolome levels in tubers and is sensed by the plant even at full irrigation transcript level of some key genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism was elevated at 20

10892,agriculture water resources are expected to decline due to increasing water demand and ongoing climate change in this context water saving irrigation techniques such as partial root zone drying prd and deficit irrigation di were assessed under glasshouse conditions on potato cultivar mondial four irrigation levels were applied 50 70 80 and 100 of field capacity during 2016 and 2017 growing seasons the results showed that the yield penalty with prd was similar to that caused by di nevertheless prd plants had higher number of stems and were shorter than di plants sugar and protein contents of tubers gradually decreased with water restriction however remained higher in prd than di tubers in contrast the amounts of polyphenols and antioxidants increased in tubers with decreasing irrigation levels untargeted metabolite analysis revealed higher metabolite content of prd than di tubers with less decrease in glucose and fructose concentrations and with double amount of mannitol transcript level of key genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism was elevated at 20 water saving in prd tubers but not in di tubers we assumed that the detected changes in tubers reflect better adaptation of plants to water saving irrigation under prd than di keywords antioxidant activity metabolite polyphenol protein sugar tuber 1 introduction water is an essential resource it plays a central and critical role in all aspects of life it is the basic element of any biological function and it is a precious resource limited and vulnerable sustainable management of this resource requires a holistic approach that integrates rational use climate change is expected to put additional stress on water supplies making water management even more complex and difficult arnell 2004 bates et al 2008 deficit irrigation di is a promising method consisting in reducing water inputs compared to a maximum level of crop so that the stress imposed does not significantly affect yield costa et al 2007 geerts and raes 2009 the objective of this irrigation method is to control vegetative growth and improve irrigation water use efficiency iwue partial root zone drying known as prd is an evolution of di and is one of the promising techniques for saving irrigation water dodd et al 2015 many studies have shown the advantage of prd by reducing water input by 30 50 without penalizing yield or even having a positive effect on quality du et al 2008 for example showed in an experimental vineyard study under arid conditions that prd treatment improved iwue and increased the number of grapes vitamin c concentration and maturity index zegbe and behboudian 2008 applied prd in humid climate on apple trees and showed that it did not adversely affect yield and fruit quality but improved iwue by 20 similar results were reported by dos santos et al 2003 on the grapevine when moderate water stress inhibited vegetative growth indeed they argued that vines and fruit trees are the most suited to the prd strategy knowing that the responses were variable depending on the species variety and climatic conditions nevertheless prd could be successfully applied also to tomato and impacted bioactive compounds and antioxidant activity casa and rouphael 2014 sun et al 2014a bogale et al 2016 prd studies in potato goes back to 2005 when saeed et al 2005 reported that prd treatment modifies shoot growth reduces plant leaf area and increases iwue andersen et al 2008 conducted experiments with cv folva in outdoor rain protected lysimeter facilities in three soil types loam sandy loam and coarse sand in prd plants received 70 of those plants which were irrigated to field capacity fc when plants were fully irrigated till tuber bulking the total yield was essentially the same in prd and fc prd during the tuber initiation stage of growth however decreased the yield and quality of tubers several studies indicate that prd irrigation may cause not only an increase of iwue but also higher nitrogen use efficiency shahnazari et al 2008a wang et al 2009 jensen et al 2010 ahmadi et al 2011 moreover prd results in a slight reduction in soluble sugar concentration and an increase in starch nitrogen and antioxidant contents of tubers jovanovic et al 2010 nevertheless there is an inconsistency on the effects of the prd on potato yield in the literature in contrast to shahnazari et al 2007 testing cv folva in coarse textured meltwater sand brocic et al 2009 detected a reduced yield of cv liseta grown in silty clay by comparing fc to 70 prd an explanation for inconsistent results in terms of the effect of prd on tuber yield was given by ahmadi et al 2010 who showed that the interaction between irrigation treatments and soil textures was significant and water saving irrigations were not recommended in loamy sand soil due to considerable loss 28 in yield with prd receiving 65 of fc furthermore by growing cv may queen in experimental plots under plastic rainout shelters it was concluded that early season prd treatment for eight weeks rather than the whole season treatment should be applied xu et al 2011 a similar result was obtained by growing the potato cv unica in sandy loam in that study it was found that an early prd initiated six weeks after planting with a watering level equivalent to even 50 of fc increased iwue with no yield reduction relative to fc yactayo et al 2013 efficiency of prd however is also cultivar dependent as it was detected in the case of agria and ramos ahmadi et al 2016 another critical factor in terms of yield might be the correct choice of duration of wet dry cycling especially in arid areas as pointed out by zin el abedin et al 2017 the above cited publications demonstrated that application of prd in potatoes is possible but it is critical to identify the conditions where this method can be effective and understand the physiological responses behind adaptation of potato to these conditions the best way of testing plants responses to prd is under controlled conditions in a greenhouse on plants with a split root system liu et al 2006 irrigated one half of the root system of cv folva for nine days and found that the xylem sap abscisic acid aba concentration increased exponentially with decreasing root water potential later it was demonstrated that hprd two lateral root compartments one dry the other wet better triggers a long distance aba signal than vprd upper root compartment dry lower compartment wet puértolas et al 2015 it was also shown that compared to di prd led to modulating stomatal morphology and significantly enhanced plant nitrogen content in relation to di and increased root to shoot ratio yan et al 2012 sun et al 2013 2014b 2015 liu et al 2015 ramírez et al 2014 found an increase in chlorophyll content of prd treated leaves and concluded that chlorophyll concentration in leaves is an indicator of potato tuber yield in water shortage conditions in morocco as water resources are constantly worsening water saving is an essential axis of the new agricultural strategy in line with this strategy the aims of our work were i to assess the feasibility of water saving irrigation techniques on potato cv mondial a variety with very high yield potential under glasshouse conditions ii to elucidate the differential effects of prd and di on growth parameters and the main quality traits of tubers iii and to study the effects of water saving irrigation on the metabolite profile and gene expression in tubers 2 material and methods 2 1 plant material and growth conditions the experiments were carried out during the growing seasons of 2016 and 2017 in a glasshouse of the national agricultural research institute in tangier northern morocco certified seedlings of solanum tuberosum l cv mondial from nak nederland with uniform size 35 55 mm in diameter were planted in normal and separated pots 25 cm diameter and 30 cm height filled with 2 3 of sandy soil and 1 3 of an organic substrate the sandy soil originated from loukkos region called r mel is inorganic and poor in nitrogen its texture is sandy with 80 5 11 and 8 5 of sand silt and clay respectively the substrate used contained the npk fertilizer 14 10 18 1 5 kg m3 with a ph of 5 5 6 5 and electrical conductivity of 40 ms m 25 the experiments were carried out in a clinvertec glasshouse ritec riegos y tecnología s l águilas murcia spain with controlled heating and humidification systems air recirculation co2 supply cooling system thermal screens and shade control the temperature inside the glasshouse was fixed between 24 and 25 c during the cultivation period from march to june and the relative humidity between 60 and 70 2 2 experimental design and irrigation treatments the experiment was setup in a randomized complete block design rcbd with two factors irrigation method and irrigation amount the first factor had two levels either deficit irrigation di or partial root zone drying prd while the second factor had four levels 50 70 80 or 100 of the field capacity fc fc of the mixed soil 2 3 of sandy soil and 1 3 of organic substrate was determined by gravimetric method before planting two control pots in each block were watered until the soil was saturated after free drainage had stopped the pots were weighted to obtain the volumetric water retained by the soil for each pot the volumetric soil moisture content θv at fc was 25 1 on the mass basis permanent wilting point was estimated to be 11 and available water 14 1 the factorial arrangement of the levels of the two mentioned factors lead to eight treatments each one of them was replicated in four blocks in total there were 2 4x4 32 experimental units each unit comprised six plants one plant pot receiving the same and a unique one of the eight treatments however for the statistical data analyses the measurements over the 6 plants were averaged such that there would be only one observation per experimental unit pots were irrigated equally 30 days after planting at fc the soil moisture content was measured gravimetrically by weighting each pot and replacing the individual loss of water to maintain the original weight shifting of irrigation in prd treatments was done empirically jensen et al 2010 depending on pots evapotranspiration di plants were irrigated every second or fourth day while prd plants were watered at alternating sites daily or every second day the same amount of water supplied to di treatments was split twice to prd treatments on either two sides of the root system receiving each compartment the half amount of water supplied to di plants in each irrigation event prd pots were separated by a rigid and impermeable pvc plate to avoid the infiltration of water from the watered compartment to the dry one 2 3 calculation of irrigation water use efficiency iwue at final harvest tubers were collected and the tuber biomass was determined for each treatment iwue g l was calculated by dividing the fresh weight of tubers g plant by the amount of water l plant used during treatment period one month after planting to two weeks before physiological maturity 2 4 dry weight and ash content determination dry matter and water content were determined by the aoac 934 06 official method by vacuum oven three grams of potato sample was placed in a clean empty and dry moisture can the moisture can containing the sample was placed in the drying vacuum oven isco lincoln ne usa that was set at 70 c for more than 8 h the dry weight dw in was determined by the formula given as dw ms ww ms 100 where ww is mass of the water and ms is total weight of the material to measure the ash content the weight of clean and dry crucible was determined and 5 g of sample were placed in the oven the crucible containing the sample was placed in an ash oven at 525 c 10 c for 3 h when the ashing was complete the weight of the sample was measured again the ash content ac in was determined by the following formula ac w2 w1 100 where w2 is weight of the remaining sample and w1 is weight of the original sample 2 5 tuber quality trait analysis the total sugar content of 10 g of tubers was extracted with ethanol tubers were placed into a sealed test tube fifty ml of 80 ethanol was added and the tubers were homogenized with an ultra turrax t50 janke and kunkel ika labortechnik staufen germany and centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 30 min in a centrifuge z 323 k hermle labortechnik gmbh wehingen germany sugars were extracted from the pellet with 5 ml of 40 ethanol and centrifuged at 15 000 rpm for 15 min the extraction was repeated and the two extracts combined total sugars content was determined using the phenol sulfuric acid method dubois et al 1956 by adding 0 25 ml of 80 aqueous phenol and 25 ml of 95 5 aqueous sulfuric acid to the extract the tubes were allowed to stand for 10 min then they were shaken and placed for 10 min in a water bath at 30 c the absorbance was measured at 490 nm by an evolution 201 spectrophotometer thermo scientific waltham ma usa the standard curve was prepared from seven glucose standard solutions 10 20 30 40 50 60 and 70 μg l to quantify total sugars protein content of tubers was calculated from the total nitrogen content of 1 g tubers determined by the kjeldahl method this method consists of digestion of samples in sulfuric acid with a catalyst kjeldahl tablets which results in conversion of nitrogen to ammonia distillation of the ammonia into a trapping solution 1 boric acid and quantification of the ammonia by titration with a standard solution 0 5 m sulfuric acid once the percentage of the total nitrogen was calculated the concentration of proteins was determined by the following equation crude protein nitrogen content 6 25 total polyphenol content of tubers was measured from 25 g tissue tubers were cut into small pieces and homogenized in 100 ml of distilled water with ultra turrax the homogenate was filtered and centrifuged at 5000 g for 20 min the potato extracts were filtered using filter paper no 1 in test tubes and boiled for 5 min in a water bath to inactivate the enzymes total phenolic content was

tubers the reaction mixtures were vortexed and stood for 10 min at room temperature then 3 ml of 20 sodium carbonate was added to each tube vortexed placed into a water bath at 40 c for 20 min and cooled in an ice bath for 3 min absorbance of samples was measured at 755 nm in an evolution 201 spectrophotometer the total phenolic content was expressed in mg gallic acid equivalent gae g fresh

treatment data were analyzed using the glm of three way analysis of variance anova the three factors were irrigation method irrigation amount and block this was the case for response variables measured during 2016 season however for the other response variables the experiment was repeated during two growing seasons 2016 and 2017 therefore an analysis of combined experiments over years dixon et al 2018 was done including the growing season as an additional factor leading to a four way anova the effects of the two main factors irrigation method and irrigation amount were considered fixed since we have only two years we considered the year effect as fixed vargas et al 2018 while the block effect was considered random the combination of fixed as well as random effects leads to a mixed

degrees of freedom of the denominator for eventually heterogeneous variances littell et al 2006 normality of data was checked using the shapiro wilk test correlation analysis was performed by pearson s method 3 results 3 1 effects of prd and di on yield iwue and growth parameters effects of prd and di on cv mondial grown in glasshouse under well controlled conditions in pots were compared in two seasons 2016 and 2017 tuber yields per plant are presented in fig 1 a the yield ranged from 120 g plant for di 50 to 202 g plant for prd at 100 of fc the tuber yield was reduced by around 40 when the water supply was restricted to 50 the statistical analysis showed significant differences in tuber yield per plant between 50 and 70 and between 80 and 100 water treatments but not between 70 and 80 supplementary table 1 the iwue was significantly higher at 70 and 50 of fc than under well watered conditions fig 1b the highest iwue values were found for prd 50 with an average of 50 6 g l and the lowest values were found in fc treatments with an average of 37 9 g l and 38 8 g l for di 100 and prd 100 respectively in all treatments the iwue of prd plants was slightly higher but not significantly different from di plants supplementary table 1 the potato plants growth was assessed as tuber number per plant number of stems per plant plant height total dry weight and ash content of tubers table 1 presents the mean data of these growth parameters measured in 2016 we found that the number of tubers per plant was not influenced by water withdrawal as it ranged from 12 to 14 tubers per plant in each treatment thus after one month of normal irrigation the water restriction did not impact the tuber number per plant there were no significant differences either in number of stems per plant or plant height between the different irrigation levels however the prd plants had a greater number of stems but were shorter than di plants even at 100 irrigation level suggesting that the alternate irrigation of root system influences plant growth the dry weight dw and ash content of tubers as a of fresh weight decreased with the severity of water withdrawal with similar tendency in prd and di however with significant differences in ash content between the two water saving irrigation strategies 3 2 effects of prd and di on sugar protein polyphenol and antioxidant content of tubers effects of prd and di on quality traits were studied both in 2016 and 2017 seasons it was found that the sugar and protein content of tubers gradually decreased with lowering the level of irrigation fig 2 a and b for all treatments however the sugar and protein content of prd tubers was higher than that of the di tubers the only exception was in the sugar contents of tubers developed at 50 of fc which were equally low independent of the irrigation strategy used supplementary table 2 in contrast to sugar and protein contents the amounts of polyphenols and antioxidants in tubers increased with decreasing irrigation levels fig 2c and d no substantial difference between the effect of prd and di in polyphenol content of tubers was detected except at 80 of fc where 20 more polyphenols were found in prd than in di tubers the antioxidant activity aa of prd tubers however was significantly higher in all treatments supplementary table 2 3 3 correlation analysis table 2 presents the correlation matrix for yield iwue dw ash polyphenol aa protein and sugar contents there were significant and positive correlations between tuber yield dw aa protein and sugars in addition significant and positive correlations were detected between iwue polyphenol concentration and aa while iwue correlated negatively with dw ash protein and sugar contents ash content and aa showed strong and negative correlation r 0 890 whereas protein and total sugars correlated positively r 0 704 total polyphenols did not correlate with aa r 0 111 3 4 effects of prd and di on metabolite composition of tubers metabolite composition of tubers was tested from the experiment performed in 2016 after harvest the tubers were stored at 4 c for 3 months an untargeted metabolite analysis was performed by gc ms based on mass spectra and authentic standards 33 metabolites were identified these included mainly sugars amino acids and organic acids glucose sucrose fructose and citric acid were present in the largest amounts supplementary table 3 the heat map presented in fig 3 a shows that the water withdrawal increased the concentrations of several metabolites and this was more pronounced in prd than in di treatments there were even some differences between the prd 100 and di 100 tubers e g in malic acid content suggesting that alternate watering of roots is sensed by the plant and manifested in a mild alteration of tuber metabolism the dendrogram in fig 3b highlights the similarity between di 100 and prd 80 tubers indicating that using alternate irrigation a very similar metabolite constitution as in di 100 tubers can be achieved with less water in line with the decrease in total sugar content the concentration of glucose and fructose was lower in tubers of less watered plants than in tubers of fc plants and higher in prd tubers than in di tubers fig 4 a and b interestingly the concentration of mannitol in prd tubers was approximately double than in di tubers under each condition fig 4c water withdrawal until 70 did not change the proline content of tubers however a twofold increase was detected in proline content when the soil water loss reached 50 fig 4d a detailed statistical analysis is presented in the supplementary table 4 3 5 effects of prd and di on gene expression since treatment dependent significant differences in sugar and proline content of tubers were detected the expression of some genes characteristic for sugar and proline metabolism was tested these genes included sucrose transporter sut4 sucrose synthase susy adp glucose pyrophosphorylase agpase granule bound starch synthase gbss mannitol dehydrogenase mad fumarase fumase and δ1 pyrroline 5 carboxylate synthase p5cs nevertheless none of them showed changes in expression correlating with sugar or proline content fig 4 5 and supplementary fig 1 although a highly elevated level of sut4 susy gbss and mad expression and with less extent but also of agpase and fumase expression was detected in prd 80 tubers fig 5 and supplementary fig 1 this observation suggests that the molecular physiology of prd 80 plants differs from the others producing tubers with elevated expression of some key genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism when stored for three months at 4 c 4 discussion 4 1 tuber yield iwue and growth parameters responses to prd and di potato solanum tuberosum l is considered a water stress sensitive crop nevertheless many authors found that the effects of water stress depend on the growth stage of the crop iqbal et al 1999 reported that the stress imposed during the early development stage of potato might cause severe yield reduction and the stress applied during the ripening stage increases iwue without adverse effect on yield although our treatments were applied after tuber initiation a significant decrease in tuber yield was detected even by water reduction of 20 fig 1a in another study reported by jensen et al 2010 30 was found to be the water saving limit compared to fc however their experiment was carried out under field conditions in a different soil type and with a different potato variety our data showed that all restricted water supply evoked higher iwue than the control regardless of irrigation strategy used fig 1b in all treatments and for the same amount of water supply the iwue of prd plants were slightly higher but not significantly different from di plants similar results were reported by yactayo et al 2009 for potted potato grown under greenhouse conditions the irrigation treatments started four weeks after planting the lack of differences in number of tubers per plant in response to irrigation level or irrigation strategies supports the hypothesis that the tuber initiation was completed before the application of treatments this agrees with several authors who reported that initiation of tubers usually begins after plant emergence and is thought to be complete within two three weeks after that event o brien et al 1998 other authors suggested that prd should be started five six weeks after tuber initiation shahnazari et al 2008b saeed et al 2008 yactayo et al 2013 our results support the theory that water saving irrigation should start after the end of tuber initiation to avoid yield decrease which could be a consequence of the reduction in tuber number per plant for normal growth and development potato needs regular water supply reduction in water or deficit irrigation leads to modifications in many morphophysiological traits growth parameters such as the number of stems per plant plant height dw and ash content are commonly dependent on the amount of water available in the soil in this study there were significant differences in plant height between prd and di when comparing the number per stems per plant for the same irrigation level we found higher number of stems in prd than in di plants suggesting that alternate irrigation of root system influences plant growth by promoting stem initiation and reducing plant height 4 2 quality of tubers under prd and di potato tuber dw is mainly constituted by starch and there are small quantities of sugars fiber protein and ash dw often ranges from 16 to 28 depending on the development stages of the crop reaching it maximum towards the end of the crop growth water stress in potato tends to improve quality of chips due to the higher percentage of tuber dw which makes the chips appropriate for the industry jensen et al 2000 kumar et al 2003 in our experiment the dw decreased with the severity of water restriction with similar tendency in prd and di and ranged from 18 5 for stressed plants di 50 to 22 7 for well watered plants di 100 similar results were reported by deblonde et al 1999 on six potato cultivars grown under temperate climate conditions and three irrigation treatments they showed that tuber dw was significantly reduced under drought treatment in comparison with fc levy 1983 and later schafleitner 2009 found that tuber dw is cultivar dependent and is a trait of adaptation of potato to water stress total sugars mainly sucrose glucose and fructose are important factors affecting quality in potatoes especially color of processed products smith 1987 in tubers they are conditioned by several parameters which include variety the environmental conditions crop management especially irrigation and several post harvest factors like storage period and temperature kumar et al 2004 there are divergent opinions on the impact of water stress on sugars accumulation in potatoes in this study it was found that the sugar content of tubers particularly glucose and fructose contents gradually decreased with lowering the water supply figs 3a 4 a and b these results were consistent with those found by wegener et al 2017 who reported that drought stressed tubers presented lower concentration of total sugars and also glucose and fructose than the well watered control tubers in contrast eldredge et al 1996 demonstrated that drought stress increases the sugar content in tubers the contradiction was solved by the observation of andré et al 2009 and muttucumaru et al 2015 who found that the different genotypes were affected in dissimilar fashion by the same treatment indicating that there is no single unifying potato tuber drought stress response for all treatments the sugar content including glucose and fructose contents was higher in prd than in di tubers the only exception was in the total sugar contents of tubers developed at 50 of fc which were equally low independent of the irrigation strategy used this increase in sugars under prd compared to di was also observed by battilani et al 2014 in one year on potato grown under field conditions in a sub humid area however not in another year which was particularly dry potato tuber proteins are considered of important nutritional value knorr 1978 in our study the protein content ranged from 0 57 to 3 13 while van niekerk 2015 reported 1 49 in mondial tubers nevertheless water stress and irrigation management play an important role in the determination of protein content in potato tubers drought stress generally decreases plant nitrogen concentration he and dijkstra 2014 our results are consistent with this observation as we showed that protein contents of tubers gradually decreased with lowering the level of irrigation fig 2b in addition tubers from prd treatments presented higher protein content compared to di for all irrigation levels similar results were reported by wang et al 2009 and sun et al 2013 who demonstrated that prd plants grown in pots had significantly higher nitrogen contents in tubers compared to di plants this finding was confirmed also for potato plants grown under field conditions jovanovic et al 2010 ahmadi et al 2016 the rise in nitrogen uptake under prd treatments may be explained either by the increase in nitrogen mineralization rate due to the high frequency of wetting drying cycles jensen et al 2010 wang et al 2010 sun et al 2013 or by an increase in root nitrogen absorption hu et al 2009 polyphenols represent a large family of plant secondary metabolites mainly hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives and flavonoids implicated in the prevention of various diseases such as cancers and cardiovascular diseases evers and deußer 2012 in this study we examined the effect of prd and di on the total polyphenols of potato tubers the results obtained fig 2c showed a significant increase in polyphenol content in response to water restriction our results are similar to those obtained by hamouz et al 2010 who reported higher total polyphenol contents in potatoes grown under drought and extreme temperatures highly cultivar dependent variations of polyphenol content were observed by andré et al 2009 who proposed that the altered sucrose flux induced by the drought stress is partly responsible for the changes in expression of genes involved in polyphenol synthesis water stress leads to increased accumulation of ros to detoxify these reactive molecules plants can intrinsically develop different types of antioxidants reducing oxidative damage and conferring drought tolerance they have both non enzymatic antioxidants such as carotenoid flavonoids α tocopherol ascorbic acid and glutathione and enzymatic antioxidants such as catalase and peroxidase choudhury et al 2017 antioxidant capacity depends on the variety environmental growth conditions crop management and post harvest storage conditions dumas et al 2003 previous work highlighted that potato responses to drought stress are complex with levels of antioxidants showing increases decreases or remaining stable depending on the genotype and kind of antioxidant andré et al 2009 our data presented in fig 2d show a clear effect of water stress and irrigation strategy on aa for each irrigation level aa was significantly higher in water stressed tubers and elevated under prd compared to di similar results were obtained by jovanovic et al 2010 from a field experiment on potato showing that prd treatment increased aa in potato tubers they presumed that the increased aa was due to an increase of total phenolic content though we also measured the total phenolic content of tubers we did not detect significant correlation between aa and phenolics table 2 therefore in our case the high aa found under prd could not be explained just by an increase in phenolics 4 3 metabolites and gene expression under prd and di one of the novelties of our findings was the detection of double amount of mannitol in prd than in di tubers irrespective of soil water content mannitol is an osmoprotectant providing salt osmotic and oxidative stress tolerance to plants and is proposed to have a role s in protecting cells and cellular structures against damage by ros patel and williamson 2016 the difference in mannitol level and in concentration of some other metabolites fig 3a and 4c as well as the slight but statistically significant differences in sugar protein and aa levels fig 2a b d and supplementary table 2 indicate that alternate watering of root system is sensed by the plant even at 100 of fc proline like mannitol has important roles in adaptation to osmotic and dehydration stresses and also in redox control fichman et al 2015 however unlike mannitol that had an elevated level only in prd tubers fig 4c proline concentration was increased in both prd and di tubers however only at 50 of fc fig 4d 50 soil water loss is a strong stress for plants irrespective of the way of irrigation and that is reflected in higher proline concentration of tubers the bifunctional enzyme p5cs catalyzes the first two steps of proline synthesis fichman et al 2015 nevertheless expression of p5cs like that of the genes encoding enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism was not in line with the level of corresponding metabolite it is very likely that this is due to the three months storage of tubers at 4 c that might resulted in degradation of mrnas synthesized in the growing stage while due to the very low activity of transcription factors at 4 c only a low number of new mrnas could be generated despite of the presumed low activity of transcription factors large amounts of mrnas derived from sut4 susy gbss and mad were detected in prd 80 tubers and also agpase and fumase expression was elevated in them to some extent fig 5 this observation together with the general picture presented in fig 3a on the elevated level of metabolites in prd 80 tubers compared to di 80 tubers suggests that there were more changes in prd 80 than in di 80 plants compared to fc 100 plants both at transcriptome and metabolome levels 5 conclusions in conclusion our results showed that the yield penalty with partial root zone drying prd was similar to that caused by deficit irrigation di the irrigation water use efficiency iwue was higher for all restricted water treatments compared to control while no substantial differences in iwue between prd and di occurred regardless of the irrigation strategy used water restriction decreased tuber dry weight sugar and protein contents however it increased the amount of polyphenols and the antioxidant activity our results revealed that prd influences plant growth by promoting stem initiation and reducing plant height another important finding of the present work is the detection of double amount of an osmoprotectant mannitol in prd tubers irrespective of water shortage level the elevated concentration of mannitol and some other metabolites as well as the slight but statistically significant differences in sugar protein and antioxidant activity levels indicate that alternate watering of root system induces important changes at metabolome levels in tubers and is sensed by the plant even at full irrigation transcript level of some key genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism was elevated at 20

10893,the rice wheat rotation system is one of the largest agricultural production systems worldwide accurate estimation of evapotranspiration et in the rice wheat rotation system is critical to enhance efficient irrigation management and water use the variation of et for a rice wheat rotation system during 2015 2018 and its controlling meteorological factors was investigated using the bowen ratio energy balance and path analysis methods a modified priestley taylor pt model considering soil water stress for soil evaporation e fsw and plant temperature constraint deviation of air temperature from optimum for the crops used ft leaf senescence for transpiration was developed the results showed that the diurnal variation of et rate in different months exhibited a single peak curve with the maximum et rates of 0 90 and 0 42 mm h 1 for rice and winter wheat respectively the total et of the rice wheat rotation system over the whole growing season was 765 841 mm of which 63 67 was consumed by the rice field the average daily et rate over the whole growing season was 3 27 4 13 and 1 50 1 65 mm d 1 for rice and winter wheat respectively the results of et partitioning showed that e accounted for 23 32 of the seasonal et for rice and 48 51 for winter wheat the et partitioning of rice and winter wheat was closely linked to leaf area index lai the ratio of e et reduced exponentially for rice with the increase of lai while it reduced linearly for winter wheat the path analysis showed that the net radiation rn was the dominant meteorological factor affecting short term et of the rice wheat rotation system through the direct effect the water vapour pressure deficit vpd another important factor influencing et showed mainly an indirect effect on et through path of rn and had a greater impact on et for rice than that for wheat the modified pt model could estimate et for rice and winter wheat reasonably with linear regression coefficient of 0 93 1 09 and coefficient of determination of 0 92 0 96 the model was sensitive to the fsw or ft keywords bowen ratio energy balance evapotranspiration partitioning oryza sativa path analysis triticum aestivum 1 introduction rice oryza sativa l and wheat triticum aestivum l are two crucial food crops around the world accounting for 45 of the digestible energy and 30 of total protein in the human diet timsina and connor 2001 huang et al 2018 many cropping systems have been adopted for rice and wheat over the past few decades such as single or double cropping rice spring or winter wheat maize wheat rotation and rice wheat rotation among them the rice wheat rotation system is one of the largest cropping systems worldwide occupying 24 26 million ha in asia mainly in the indo gangetic plains in south asia and in south china ladha et al 2003 in china the rice wheat rotation system occupies 10 of the arable land 9 13 million ha mainly practiced along the yangtze river basin such as zhejiang jiangsu anhui hubei guizhou yunnan and sichuan provinces jing et al 2010 in cropland 99 of the water was consumed by evapotranspiration et rana and katerji 2000 et not only participates in water and energy cycles but is also one of the key factors influencing crop growth dry biomass production and yield determination of et during the growing season is fundamental to attain efficient irrigation scheduling manage water resources assess and quantify the production of food feed fiber and biofuels ko et al 2009 allen et al 2011 shahrokhnia and sepaskhah 2013 zheng et al 2018 therefore advanced knowledge of et continues to draw the attention of meteorologists hydrologists agronomists and ecologists numerous studies have been conducted on et of rice or wheat using lysimeters mishra et al 1990 liu et al 2002 kang et al 2003 ko et al 2009 shahrokhnia and sepaskhah 2013 xu et al 2017 eddy covariance zhao et al 2008 zhang et al 2013 alberto et al 2014 timm et al 2014 wang et al 2017 bowen ratio energy

tower sakai et al 2010 etc when reviewing these literature the reported et of rice and wheat based on different measurement methods varied considerably total seasonal et ranging from 307 to 899 mm for rice and varying from 213 to 957 mm for winter wheat without water and nitrogen stresses which may be attributed to the differences in cultivars growth periods management methods e g irrigation method and amount planting density mulching etc and regional climate conditions among these influencing factors meteorological conditions e g solar radiation air temperature ta water vapour pressure deficit vpd and wind speed u are the main controlling factors zhang et al 2016 fan et al 2018a b when assessing the effects of these controlling factors on et the path analysis method is widely used zhang et al 2016 gong et al 2017 qiu et al 2018 the path analysis method can identify the direct and indirect effects from independent to dependent variables and the independent variables with multi collinearity to explain the degree of effects of all factors seker and serin 2004 ssango et al 2004 zhang et al 2016 the method is based on the statistical techniques and structural equation modeling integrated into traditional multivariate statistical analysis to determine interrelation among variables mode of action and degree of effects from independent to dependent variables zhang et al 2016 using this method zhang et al 2016 indicated that solar radiation was the main driving factor on et and ta and vpd also have important influence on farmland et however the effects of meteorological factors on et for different crops can be different in addition most of previous studies were mainly conducted for a single crop to our best of knowledge little information was available on the diurnal seasonal and interannual variations of et and et partitioning in a rice wheat rotation system using the breb method since the measurement of et is difficult and costly many models have been developed to estimate et such as penman monteith model e g qiu et al 2013 li et al 2019 priestley taylor pt model e g ding et al 2013 ershadi et al 2014 crop coefficient method e g zhang et al 2013 qiu et al 2015 and shuttle wallance and clumping method e g zhang et al 2008a zhao et al 2015 among them the pt model a simplified version of the penman model that avoids the calculation of the aerodynamic term has been widely used priestley and taylor 1972 yao et al 2013 ershadi et al 2014 ai and yang 2016 the accuracy of the model mainly relies on the accurate determination of the only empirical parameter αe a well known pt coefficient with the value of 1 26 for saturated conditions and open water bodies priestley and taylor 1972 ai and yang 2016 although a number of studies have showed that this value could be used in some vegetated surface pereira 2004 utset et al 2004 many studies indicated that αe had a large variation over the whole growing season especially for sub daily time scales pereira 2004 ding et al 2013 assouline et al 2016 the main reported factors affecting αe include mulching method green canopy fraction air temperature soil moisture availability relative humidity etc ding et al 2013 yao et al 2013 ershadi et al 2014 ai and yang 2016 therefore estimating dynamic αe by developing a unique function considering various limited factors is still an important scientific issue here the variation of et during 2015 2018 in a rice wheat rotation system in the yangtze river basin china was measured by using the breb method a modified pt model considering the effects of air temperature surface soil water content and leaf senescence on et was developed the objectives of this study are 1 to quantify diurnal seasonal and interannual variations of et and et partitioning of a rice wheat rotation system 2 to determine the main controlling meteorological factors on et of rice and winter wheat using the path analysis method 3 to assess the performance of the modified pt model on the estimation of et 2 materials and methods 2 1 experiment site and measurements for 2015 2017 the experiment was conducted at the agro meteorology research station station 1 nanjing university of information science and technology located in nanjing city jiangsu province of china 32 21 n 118 68 e altitude 14 4 m after that period the experiment was conducted at 5 km away from the aforementioned station station 2 both of the these stations are located in a subtropical monsoon climate zone with the mean annual precipitation of 1106 mm the mean annual air temperature of 15 4 c and the frost free period of 237 days the soil at the two stations is a silt loam the soil physical parameters including particle size distribution bulk density field water capacity and wilting point in different soil layers at the two stations are shown in table 1 the common planting pattern in this area is the rice wheat rotation system rice is cultivated during summer jun and autumn oct or nov while winter wheat is grown from late autumn nov or dec to late spring may table 2 shows the crop information precipitation and irrigation amount during the whole growing season of the rice wheat rotation system during 2015 2018 there was no irrigation event for winter wheat while 10 13 and 14 irrigation events were applied for rice in the 2016 2017 and 2018 seasons respectively the water inputs i e sum of irrigation and precipitation were greater for the rice field than those for the winter wheat field because of frequent irrigation events and high precipitation table 2 however winter wheat plants did not suffer from water deficit based on the measurements of the soil water content always greater than 75 of the field water capacity data not shown the distances between the rows and within the row for rice plants were both 0 18 m in the 2016 and 2017 seasons an empty row of 0 60 m was set up every 20 rows for agronomic operations in the 2018 season the rice seeds were directly sowed with a sowing rate of 240 kg ha 1 on jun 1 2018 the distance between rows for winter wheat plants was 0 15 m in the 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 seasons while in the 2017 2018 season the winter wheat seeds were directly sowed the sowing rate of winter wheat was 300 375 and 300 kg ha 1 for the 2015 2016 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 seasons respectively the management of the rice wheat rotation system such as irrigation fertilization and pest control was operated by local farmers fertilizer was mixed and applied using npk compound fertilizer 15 15 15 n p2o5 k2o and urea at 750 and 600 kg ha 1 for rice respectively and at 600 and 450 kg ha 1 for winter wheat respectively the maximum crop height for rice and winter wheat was 1 1 and 0 8 m respectively leaf area index lai for rice and winter wheat was measured with a lai 2000 canopy analysis system li cor inc lincoln ne usa with four replications every 7 15 days daily variation of lai was fitted with the piecewise cubic hermite interpolating polynomial method using the matlab software mathworks inc ma usa daily evaporation e rates for the rice field were measured using four rectangle plastic plates with 0 23 m in length 0 17 m in width and 0 045 m in depth before measurement fresh water with 16 mm was applied in each plate before sunset the remaining water was measured except for rainy days using a rain gauge made by glass with a precision of 0 1 mm to determine daily e rate the fresh water was then supplemented to 16 mm for each plastic plate to determine the next day s e rate the average of the four measurements was used as the daily e rate during most of the growth period the soil surface of the rice field was covered with water when water was absent most of time during the end of crop development and late stages the e rate of soil surface was assumed to be e rate of water surface because of wet soil surface and high canopy coverage where e rate was low daily soil e rate of the winter wheat field was determined using four micro lysimeters made by pvc with 0 11 m in diameter and 0 15 m in depth before installation slightly larger pvc cylinders with the same depth facilitating in and out movement of the micro lysimeters were pushed into the ground and the inside soil emptied the micro lysimeters contained undisturbed soils with the bottom covered with a filter and plastic net and were weighted daily before sunset except for rainy days using an electronic scale with a precision of 0 1 g tc20khb hangzhou shuangjie ltd china to determine the water loss for the rice and winter wheat field using the measured daily e rate we first analyzed the relationship between e et and lai the missing daily e rate data for rice and winter wheat were then interpolated using the obtained correlations finally the total values of e at different growth stages and during the whole growing season were analyzed the breb system campbell scientific incorporated logan utah usa csi hereafter was installed in the southwest of the field 170 m long and 150 m wide for station 1 from mar 19 2016 and in the north of the field for station 2 210 m long and 100 m wide from nov 22 2017 the prevailing wind directions were both east northeast ene during the growing season of rice and winter wheat at station 1 while east southeast ese at station 2 net radiation rn w m 2 u m s 1 and wind direction were measured by a net radiometer model nr lite2 kipp zonen delft netherlands and wind sensor model 034b met one instruments inc oregon usa moi hereafter respectively both mounted at 2 0 m above the ground relative humidity rh and ta c at two heights 1 5 and 2 9 m above the ground were measured using two high precision temperature humidity sensors model 083e 1 moi with fan aspirated radiation shield model 076b moi the accuracy of sensors is 2 rh and 0 1 c for rh and ta respectively the measurement accuracy of rh and ta at two heights is crucial for breb method hence the two sensors were installed at the same height i e 1 5 m for 2 4 days to determine system bias between two sensors after the end of the each growth season for rice and winter wheat the vpd was calculated according to fao 56 based on the measurements of ta and rh at 1 5 m height allen et al 1998 surface water level hw m was measured by a pressure transducer model cs451 csi volumetric soil moisture θ cm3 cm 3 at 0 0 1 m depth was measured by using a soil water content reflectometer model cs616 csi and was calibrated using the oven drying method an infrared radiometer model si 111 apogee instruments inc logan utah usa oriented vertically downward was installed at a height of 0 1 m to measure the surface water temperature when water was present and soil surface temperature when water was absent soil heat flux gs w m 2 was measured by two heat flux plates model hfp01 hukseflux delft netherlands buried at depth of 0 05 and 0 08 m below the soil surface in the rice and winter wheat fields respectively four type t thermocouples model tt t 24 sle omega engineering inc stamford usa calibrated against type e thermocouple model tcav csi were used to measure soil temperatures ts c above the soil heat flux plates at the soil surface covered with some soil to avoid solar radiation heating and at a depth of 0 03 m below the ground for rice field and at a depth of 0 02 and 0 06 m for winter wheat field in line with each soil heat flux plate all data were stored by a data logger cr1000 csi every 5 s and 10 min averages were recorded the surface soil heat flux g w m 2 and water storage heat flux fw w m 2 were calculated as follows 1 g g s d t s d t h s ρ w c w θ ρ b c s 2 f w ρ w c w h w d t w d t where gs is the soil heat flux at a depth of 0 05 or 0 08 m average values of two sensors dts is the variation

temperature hs is the depth of layer above soil heat flux sensors 0 05 m for rice field and 0 08 m for winter wheat field ρw and ρb are water density 1000 kg m 3 and soil dry bulk density 1440 kg m 3 for station 1 and 1530 kg m 3 for station 2 respectively cs and cw are the specific heat capacity for soil solid portion 840 j kg 1 k 1 and water 4190 j kg 1 k 1 respectively 2 2 breb method latent heat flux λet w m 2 can be estimated by combining the energy balance equation and bowen ratio equation 3 r n λ e t h g f w 4 β h λ e t where h is the sensible heat flux w m 2 λ is the heat of water vaporization j kg 1 β is the bowen ratio et is the evapotranspiration mm and fw is 0 when the surface water is absent combining eqs 3 and 4 the values of λet and h are given as 5 λ e t r n g f w 1 β 6 h β 1 β r n g f w where 1 β 0 β can also be calculated from the gradient of air temperature and water vapour pressure between two heights 7 β γ δ t δ e where t and e are the difference in air temperature oc and water vapour pressure kpa between the two measurement heights respectively γ is the psychrometric constant kpa oc 1 all collected raw data from the breb method were filtered for quality control according to the criteria proposed by perez et al 1999 the discarded inappropriate 10 min λet fluxes were then filled using a function of available energy rn g fw for rice and rn g for winter wheat linear regressions between 10 min λet and available energy were determined every 4 day interval and used to fill in the missing λet fluxes the energy balance method were then used to fill in the missing h h rn g fw λet the matlab code for data quality control and data interpolation could be found in the supplemental materials as well as in the github https github com shuilibite tab repositories 2 3 path analysis method the basic calculated process of path analysis method is as follows the method assumes there are n independent variables x1 x2 x3 xn and one dependent variable y if the correlation coefficient between each independent variable is rij and the direct path coefficient from xi to y is piy then the indirect path coefficient from xi to y through xj is rij pjy therefore the correlation coefficient riy between xi and y can be divided by direct path coefficient and sum of indirect path coefficient as 8 r i y p i y j i n r i j p j y i 1 2 n then we further define decision coefficient r i 2 as follows yuan et al 2001 9 r i 2 p i y 2 2 j i p i y r i j p j y 2 p i y r i y p i y 2 the r i 2 is a comprehensive index to assess the effect of xi on y with the order of r i 2 we can determine the main decision and limited variables the positive decision coefficient represents active effect of independent variable to dependent variable while negative value has inhibited effect in this study we selected 10 min et of rice and winter wheat as dependent variable and rn ta at 1 5 m height vpd and u at 10 min interval as independent variables to determine the main controlling meteorological factors on short term et the spss software version 21 0 ibm corp armonk ny was used to calculate pearson correlation coefficient between each two meteorological factors and between et and each meteorological factor correlations part of the output should tick descriptives of the statistic option for analysis and direct path coefficient standard coefficients column in output of coefficients part using linear regression analysis these values were then shown in a path chart from the figure the indirect path coefficients and decision coefficients could be easily calculated using eqs 8 and 9 2 4 modified pt model the pt model estimates et as follows 10 λ e t α e δ δ γ r n g f w where αe is the bulk pt coefficient varying under different underlying surfaces δ is the slope of saturation water vapour pressure relationship with ta kpa k 1 and increased as ta increased allen et al 1998 the et can be divided into transpiration tr and e and can be estimated based on the received available energy flux 11 λ t r α c δ δ γ r n c 12 λ e s α s δ δ γ r n s g f w where rnc and rns are the received energy flux by canopy and soil or water surface respectively determined as 13 r n s τ r n r n c 1 τ r n 14 τ e x p k lai where τ is the fraction of rn transmission reaching the soil or water surface and k is the canopy extinction coefficient the reported measurement methods of k are either using a portable quantum flux sensor or a portable rn sensor there should have some differences between two coefficients when using these two sensors while measurement by the portable rn sensor was rarely reported since there is good relationship between rn w m 2 and par umol m 2 s 1 par 2 387r n r2 0 95 the k measured using two sensors may be not differ significantly in this study the reported literature values 0 45 for rice hossen et al 2012 alberto et al 2014 and 0 70 for winter wheat olesen et al 2004 zhang et al 2008b were used αc and αs are the coefficients for tr and e respectively given as 15 α c 1 f s f t α c 0 α s f s w α s 0 where fsw is the index of soil water stress for soil evaporation determined as ding et al 2013 16 f s w s e s e 0

variations of monthly meteorological conditions i e rn ta vpd and u during the whole growing seasons of the rice wheat rotation system are shown in fig 1 the monthly total values of rn ranged from 5 4 to 395 5 mj m 2 for the rice field and varied from 15 2 to 285 8 mj m 2 for the winter wheat field obviously more energy flux was received over the rice field which was 1 6 times higher than that over the winter wheat field compared to winter wheat plants rice plants were grown in much hotter and more humid conditions as indicated by higher ta 10 c on average and greater rh 9 rh on average correspondingly the average value of vpd was 31 greater in the rice field than that in the winter wheat field the values of measured monthly u varied from 0 69 to 1 52 m s 1 for the rice field and ranged from 1 08 to 1 63 m s 1 for the winter wheat field the maximum monthly values of rn ta and vpd were observed in jul or aug for the rice while in apr or may for the winter wheat 3 2 variation of et and e in the rice wheat rotation system 3 2 1 diurnal variation of et fig 2 shows the diurnal variation of et in the rice wheat rotation system in different months in general the diurnal variation of et rate exhibited a single peak curve which started to increase as rn increased with its maximum around middle day varying in different months for different crops and then decreased until sunset at night the et rate was very low and the values were negative in some months due to condensation during the night li et al 2008 the maximum et rate in each month varied from 0 21 0 90 mm h 1 for rice and ranged from 0 08 0 42 mm h 1 for winter wheat the high et rates appeared in jul and aug for rice while in apr and may followed by mar for winter wheat which mainly contributed to high rn and vpd in these months fig 1 generally the et rates for rice were greater than that for winter wheat as a result of the wetter soil surface flooding in most of time more energy flux received and hotter environment in the rice field 3 2 2 seasonal and interannual variation of et and e the seasonal variations of daily et e rate lai and water inputs for the rice wheat rotation system are displayed in fig 3 the daily et rate of rice started to increase from the initial stage with its maximum rate 7 00 11 87 mm d 1 at the crop development stage and then decreased until the end of the season fig 3b d f table 3 based on the literature summary table 4 the peak daily et rate ranged from 5 5 to 12 8 mm d 1 in different regions e g china india philippine japan usa spain thailand brazil namibia cambodia bangladesh in the similar climate zone nearby our experiment site i e kunshang china with similar growth period the maximum daily et rate of 8 0 10 5 mm d 1 were observed by using eddy covariance and lysimeter methods liu et al 2017 xu et al 2017 which was close to this study the et for rice was mainly consumed at the crop development and middle stages accounting for 65 87 of total seasonal et as a result of frequent precipitation at the initial and late stages in the 2016 season the daily average et rate of rice at these two stages was lower than that in the 2017 and 2018 seasons fig 3 b d table 3 the total et of rice over the whole growing season was 479 8 561 3 and 527 1 mm for the 2016 2017 and 2018 seasons respectively these values were within the range of the total seasonal et reported in india philippine and southern china but greater than the water consumption reported in japan bangladesh and brazil and less than the values observed in california of usa spain namibia and northern china table 4 the differences between the total seasonal et observed from different studies in different regions may result from the differences in growth periods cultivars et measurement methods table 4 crop management and meteorological conditions zhang et al 2010 2011 the average daily et rate for rice over the growing season was 3 27 4 13 mm d 1 table 3 which was within the range of values reported by most of other research table 4 zhao et al 2008 reported a low average daily et rate of 2 76 2 84 mm d 1 for rice measured by eddy covariance method in sanjiang plain china however a high average daily et rate of 4 76 5 05 mm d 1 for rice was observed using water balance method nearby our experiment site shao et al 2014 evaporation rate is high for rice at the initial stage when lai was low reaching its maximum values of 4 90 5 28 and 5 76 mm d 1 for the 2016 2017 and 2018 seasons respectively fig 3 b d f after rice plants grew rapidly e rate started to decrease as the canopy coverage increased during the late season of 2016 the e was lowest because of frequent precipitation and high canopy coverage table 3 fig 3 the seasonal average e rate in the 2016 2017 and 2018 seasons was 0 86 0 95 and 1 06 mm d 1 respectively which was similar to the previous estimated values 0 99 1 04 mm d 1 by hossen et al 2012 however alberto et al 2014 showed the estimated average seasonal e rate of rice was 1 75 1 93 mm d 1 in laguna philippines and batchelor and roberts 1983 reported an even larger seasonal average e rate of 2 11 mm d 1 in sri lanka for winter wheat the daily et rate was low during winter from then on et rate started to increase reaching its maximum value of 5 57 and 4 97 mm d 1 at the middle or late stage for the 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 seasons respectively fig 3 the peak daily value was slightly greater than the values reported by kang et al 2003 4 5 mm d 1 and tyagi et al 2000a 4 6 mm d 1 but considerably lower than the reported values in other literature 7 12 mm d 1 table 4 the daily average et of winter wheat was 1 50 1 65 mm d 1 within the values reported in northern china 1 46 2 27 mm d 1 table 4 the total seasonal et of winter wheat was 285 4 and 279 4 mm for the 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 seasons respectively which was in agreement with the previous results by dar et al 2017 while less than the values reported in numerous studies table 4 for instance the reported total et of winter wheat over whole growing season in north china was 347 551 mm liu et al 2002 kang et al 2003 sun et al 2006 chen et al 2007 gao et al 2009 liu and luo 2010 liu et al 2011 zhang et al 2013 cui et al 2018 wang et al 2018 several reasons may lead to the difference in et between the north and yangtze river basin of china firstly more precipitation may lead to reduced solar radiation in the yangtze river basin which resulted in lower et rate secondly heavy or continuous rain sometimes occurred during harvesting time of rice which also delayed the planting date of winter wheat therefore the growth period of winter wheat in this area was shorter than that in northern china which had an inhibited effect on crop growth and canopy coverage in addition different measurement methods may also contribute to the difference unlike rice the e rate of winter wheat was high at the beginning declined during the winter season and then started to increase from the spring as et increased fig 3 the total e of winter wheat over the growing season was 136 and 142 mm for 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 seasons respectively which was in accordance with the values reported by kang et al 2003 sun et al 2006 and chen et al 2007 without mulching on average the total seasonal et of rice was 45 greater compared to winter wheat while the total seasonal e was almost the same 3 3 relationship between e et and lai and et partitioning with measured e et and lai of three years data a significant exponential function was proposed between e et of rice and lai with high coefficient of determination r2 of 0 87 as shown in fig 4 a 23 e et exp b lai where b is the specific canopy coefficient equal to 0 49 in this study for winter wheat a significant negative linear relationship between e et and lai was observed with r2 of 0 59 as shown in fig 4b 24 e et 0 093lai 0 70 although eq 23 was used to estimate e of rice in several studies hossen et al 2012 alberto et al 2014 the equation was not verified the ratio of e et was affected by lai available soil surface water content and coverage type sepaskhah and ilampour 1995 kato et al 2004 eberbach et al 2011 zhang et al 2011 since water was not limited for rice e et for rice was mainly dominated by the energy flux received by water or soil surface and coverage type the value of b in this study is close to the value of extinction coefficient hossen et al 2012 alberto et al 2014 while the value of b was high for other crops when soil surface was dry e g 1 25 for sorghum kato et al 2004 0 62 for cotton al khafaf et al 1978 and 0 75 for cowpea sepaskhah and ilampour 1995 after gap filling of the missing daily e rate for rice and winter wheat using eqs 23 and 24 the partitioning of the et was analyzed evaporation was the dominant portion of et for rice at the initial stage accounting for 74 86 of et after that it dropped to 11 25 at the other stages as the canopy coverage or lai increased table 3 the e et of rice over the whole growing season was 23 32 which was within the range of reported values 29 36 by batchelor and roberts 1983 and hossen et al 2012 however alberto et al 2014 reported a high e et of 40 47 in laguna the philippines for winter wheat the e et was 69 at the initial stage as the canopy coverage increased e et decreased to 31 39 at the middle stage and increased to 44 at the late stage the average e et during whole growing season for winter wheat was 48 51 close to the value reported by eberbach and pala 2005 but greater than values observed in northern china table 4 3 4 controlling meteorological factors of 10 min et for rice and winter wheat the direct path correlations between 10 min et of rice and winter wheat and meteorological factors i e rn ta vpd and u and the correlations between each meteorological factor are shown in fig 5 the correlation between ta and vpd was the highest for vpd calculated from ta and rh followed by rn and vpd rn and ta this result was in agreement with the findings by zhang et al 2016 although the values of correlation among meteorological factors were somehow different table 5 shows the path analysis results of 10 min et of rice and winter wheat and each meteorological factor due to direct and indirect action of each meteorological factor the order of the correlations between et of rice and winter wheat and meteorological factors was u ta vpd rn the direct action of rn on et was greatest and the indirect effect of rn on et was mainly through the path of vpd on et the direct effect of ta on et was negative therefore the influence of ta on et was mainly through indirect path of rn and vpd on et the similar results were also observed for vpd and u on et while the indirect effect was mainly through path of rn on et among meteorological factors only the direct path coefficient of rn on et was greater than the total indirect path coefficient showing that the effect of rn on et was mainly through direct effect while other meteorological factors were mainly through indirect effect the high decision coefficient of rn indicated that rn was the main decision factor affecting et table 5 which is in agreement with the results of alberto et al 2014 this finding may not be surprising since high solar radiation not only lead to the variation of ta and rh but also induces stomata opening to enhance transpiration in addition vpd is another factor affecting et as it represents the comprehensive effect of ta and rh which may affect the opening of stomata zhang et al 2016 however the indirect effect of vpd on et through path of rn is dominant table 5 the negative values of decision coefficient for ta show that the ta was the limiting factor for et of rice and winter wheat high ta in summer for rice or low ta in winter for winter wheat may have negative effects on et this result can provide a basis for using modified pt model considering ta comparing the path analysis results for rice and winter wheat the direct path correlation of rn on et for rice was slightly less than that for winter wheat indicating that the direct action of rn on et for rice was less the total indirect path coefficients of each parameter for rice were greater than that for wheat showing that the indirect action of each parameter for et of rice was large the vpd may have a greater impact on et for rice than for winter wheat as indicated by the large value of the decision coefficient for vpd 3 5 et calculation using the modified pt model based on the dynamic pt coefficient considering fsw ft and fs the modified pt model was evaluated the model was not applied to rice in 2017 because the rice field experienced advection and the model generally performs well under minimum advection sumner and jacobs 2005 ershadi et al 2014 for other years good agreement was observed between the measured and estimated et using the modified pt model for rice and winter wheat fig 6 the linear regression coefficients were 0 93 1 09 and 1 05 1 07 for rice and winter wheat respectively and the r2 ranged between 0 92 0 96 indicating most of the total variance of the measured values was explained by the model the mean absolute error and root mean square error were 17 2 21 4 w m 2 and 28 9 39 1 w m 2 for rice respectively while 15 0 15 5 w m 2 and 26 2 27 3 w m 2 for winter wheat these results indicate that the modified pt model could estimate et reasonably for rice and winter wheat in the yangtze river basin of china the modified pt model was widely used and performed well for many crops such as maize ding et al 2013 and cotton ai and yang 2016 pasture sumner and jacobs 2005 and mixed land cover types fisher et al 2008 yao et al 2013 ershadi et al 2014 where αe was modified by a combination of various factors such as soil mulching lai solar radiation soil water content green canopy fraction surface wetness ta and rh to evaluate the sensitivity of modified pt model to the uncertainties in the values of input parameters such as ta linked to ft swc linked to fsw fs and lai the percentage variation in the estimated total seasonal et was calculated we set the values of input parameters varied by 30 in this study the sensitive analysis showed that the model for rice was sensitive to ta with deviation of 6 12 while insensitive to fs and swc because the high et rate of rice mainly occurred before the late stage fig 2 and soil surface water was not limited in most of time the lai also had little effect on the model for rice with the deviation of 0 7 for winter wheat the model was insensitive to fs and lai but sensitive to ta deviation of 7 8 9 1 and swc at 0 0 1 m deviation of 4 4 9 9 garcía et al 2013 also showed that ft and fsw was the most sensitive parameters for modified pt model for an open woody savannah and mediterranean grassland to further evaluate the effect of ft or fsw on et the αe under varying lai was calculated with different values of ft 1 0 8 0 5 for rice and different values of ft 1 0 5 and fsw 1 0 7 0 for winter wheat fig 7 the results showed that αe was reduced for lower ft or fsw under the same lai when ft decreased from 1 0 to 0 5 under non limited surface soil water fsw 1 conditions αe decreased as lai increased and the mean αe decreased by 37 1 and 41 7 for rice and winter wheat respectively when ta was optimum ft 1 and fsw decreased from 1 to 0 αe increased as lai increased but the mean αe was reduced by 16 7 for winter wheat which is in agreement with the finding by ding et al 2013 for maize fig 7 also showed that αe varied considerably before soil or water surface was not fully covered by canopy especially when lai 1 0 4 conclusions in this study the seasonal variation of et in a rice wheat rotation system measured by the breb method et partition and controlling meteorological factors of et were investigated based on the measured et a modified pt model was evaluated the results showed that the seasonal et of the rice wheat rotation system was 765 841 mm the et for rice was mainly consumed by transpiration accounting for 68 77 of total seasonal et by contrast e accounted for 48 51 of total seasonal et for winter wheat et partitioning was mainly controlled by lai a significant exponential relationship for rice and linear relationship for winter wheat between e et and lai was well established the rn was the dominant meteorological factor affecting short term et through the direct effect followed by vpd mainly through an indirect effect the direct action of rn on et for rice was less while the indirect action of rn ta vpd and u on et was greater for rice than for winter wheat the modified pt model considering the effects of fsw ft and fs could estimate et of the rice wheat rotation system reasonably and was sensitive to the fsw or ft acknowledgements we are grateful for the research grants from the national natural science foundation of china

10893,the rice wheat rotation system is one of the largest agricultural production systems worldwide accurate estimation of evapotranspiration et in the rice wheat rotation system is critical to enhance efficient irrigation management and water use the variation of et for a rice wheat rotation system during 2015 2018 and its controlling meteorological factors was investigated using the bowen ratio energy balance and path analysis methods a modified priestley taylor pt model considering soil water stress for soil evaporation e fsw and plant temperature constraint deviation of air temperature from optimum for the crops used ft leaf senescence for transpiration was developed the results showed that the diurnal variation of et rate in different months exhibited a single peak curve with the maximum et rates of 0 90 and 0 42 mm h 1 for rice and winter wheat respectively the total et of the rice wheat rotation system over the whole growing season was 765 841 mm of which 63 67 was consumed by the rice field the average daily et rate over the whole growing season was 3 27 4 13 and 1 50 1 65 mm d 1 for rice and winter wheat respectively the results of et partitioning showed that e accounted for 23 32 of the seasonal et for rice and 48 51 for winter wheat the et partitioning of rice and winter wheat was closely linked to leaf area index lai the ratio of e et reduced exponentially for rice with the increase of lai while it reduced linearly for winter wheat the path analysis showed that the net radiation rn was the dominant meteorological factor affecting short term et of the rice wheat rotation system through the direct effect the water vapour pressure deficit vpd another important factor influencing et showed mainly an indirect effect on et through path of rn and had a greater impact on et for rice than that for wheat the modified pt model could estimate et for rice and winter wheat reasonably with linear regression coefficient of 0 93 1 09 and coefficient of determination of 0 92 0 96 the model was sensitive to the fsw or ft keywords bowen ratio energy balance evapotranspiration partitioning oryza sativa path analysis triticum aestivum 1

vpd and wind speed u are the main controlling factors zhang et al 2016 fan et al 2018a b when assessing the effects of these controlling factors on et the path analysis method is widely used zhang et al 2016 gong et al 2017 qiu et al 2018 the path analysis method can identify the direct and indirect effects from independent to dependent variables and the independent variables with multi collinearity to explain the degree of effects of all factors seker and serin 2004 ssango et al 2004 zhang et al 2016 the method is based on the statistical techniques and structural equation modeling integrated into traditional multivariate statistical analysis to determine interrelation among variables mode of action and degree of effects from independent to dependent variables zhang et al 2016 using this method zhang et al 2016 indicated that solar radiation was the main driving factor on et and ta and vpd also have important influence on farmland et however the effects of meteorological factors on et for different crops can be different in addition most of previous studies were mainly conducted for a single crop to our best of knowledge little information was available on the diurnal seasonal and interannual variations of et and et partitioning in a rice wheat rotation system using the breb method since the measurement of et is difficult and costly many models have been developed to estimate et such as penman monteith model e g qiu et al 2013 li et al 2019 priestley taylor pt model e g ding et al 2013 ershadi et al 2014 crop coefficient method e g zhang et al 2013 qiu et al

has been widely used priestley and taylor 1972 yao et al 2013 ershadi et al 2014 ai and yang 2016 the accuracy of the model mainly relies on the accurate determination of the only empirical parameter αe a well known pt coefficient with the value of 1 26 for saturated conditions and open water bodies priestley and taylor 1972 ai and yang 2016 although a number of studies have showed that this value could be used in some vegetated surface pereira 2004 utset et al 2004 many studies indicated that αe had a large variation over the whole growing season especially for sub daily time scales pereira 2004 ding et al 2013 assouline et al 2016 the main reported factors affecting αe include mulching method green canopy fraction air temperature soil moisture availability relative humidity etc ding et al 2013 yao et al 2013 ershadi et al 2014 ai and yang 2016 therefore estimating dynamic αe by developing a unique function considering various limited factors is still an important scientific issue here the variation of et during 2015 2018 in a rice wheat rotation system in the yangtze river basin china was measured by using the breb method a modified pt model considering the effects of air temperature surface soil water content and leaf senescence on et was developed the objectives of this study are 1 to quantify diurnal seasonal and interannual variations of et and et partitioning of a rice wheat rotation system 2 to determine the main controlling meteorological factors on et of rice and winter wheat using the path analysis method 3 to assess the performance of the modified pt model on the estimation of et 2 materials and methods 2 1 experiment site and measurements for 2015 2017 the experiment was conducted at the agro meteorology research station station 1 nanjing university of information science and technology located in nanjing city jiangsu province of china 32 21 n 118 68 e altitude 14 4 m after that period the experiment was conducted at 5 km away from the aforementioned station station 2 both of the these stations are located in a subtropical monsoon climate zone with the mean annual precipitation of 1106 mm the mean annual air temperature of 15 4 c and the frost free period of 237 days the soil at the two stations is a silt loam the soil physical parameters including particle size distribution bulk density field water capacity and wilting point in different soil layers at the two stations are shown in table 1 the common planting pattern in this area is the rice wheat rotation system rice is cultivated during summer jun and autumn oct or nov while winter wheat is grown from late autumn nov or dec to late spring may table 2 shows the crop information precipitation and irrigation amount during the whole growing season of the rice wheat rotation system during 2015 2018 there was no irrigation event for winter wheat while 10 13 and 14 irrigation events were applied for rice in the 2016 2017 and 2018 seasons respectively the water inputs i e sum of irrigation and precipitation were greater for the rice field than those for the winter wheat field because of frequent irrigation events and high precipitation table 2 however winter wheat plants did not suffer from water deficit based on the measurements of the soil water content always greater than 75 of the field water capacity data not shown the distances between the rows and within the row for rice plants were both 0 18 m in the 2016 and 2017 seasons an empty row of 0 60 m was set up every 20 rows for agronomic operations in the 2018 season the rice seeds were directly sowed with a sowing rate of 240 kg ha 1 on jun 1 2018 the distance between rows for winter wheat plants was 0 15 m in the 2015 2016 and 2016 2017 seasons while in the 2017 2018 season the winter wheat seeds were directly sowed the sowing rate of winter wheat was 300 375 and 300 kg ha 1 for the 2015 2016 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 seasons respectively the management of the rice wheat rotation system such as irrigation fertilization and pest control was operated by local farmers fertilizer was mixed and applied using npk compound fertilizer 15 15 15 n p2o5 k2o and urea at 750 and 600 kg ha 1 for rice respectively and at 600 and 450 kg ha 1 for winter wheat respectively the maximum crop height for rice and winter wheat was 1 1 and 0 8 m respectively leaf area index lai for rice and winter wheat was measured with a lai 2000 canopy analysis system li cor inc lincoln ne usa with four replications every 7 15 days daily variation of lai was fitted with the piecewise cubic hermite interpolating polynomial method using the matlab software mathworks inc ma usa daily evaporation e rates for the rice field were measured using four rectangle plastic plates with 0 23 m in length 0 17 m in width and 0 045 m in depth before measurement fresh water with 16 mm was applied in each plate before sunset the remaining water was measured except for rainy days using a rain gauge made by glass with a precision of 0 1 mm to determine daily e rate the fresh water was then supplemented to 16 mm for each plastic plate to determine the next day s e rate the average of the four measurements was used as the daily e rate during most of the growth period the soil surface of the rice field was covered with water when water was absent most of time during the end of crop development and late stages the e rate of soil surface was assumed to be e rate of water surface because of wet soil surface and high canopy coverage where e rate was low daily soil e rate of the winter wheat field was determined using four micro lysimeters made by pvc with 0 11 m in diameter and 0 15 m in depth before installation slightly larger pvc cylinders with the same depth facilitating in and out movement of the micro lysimeters were pushed into the ground and the inside soil emptied the micro lysimeters contained undisturbed soils with the bottom covered with a filter and plastic net and were weighted daily before sunset except for rainy days using an electronic scale with a precision of 0 1 g tc20khb hangzhou shuangjie ltd china to determine the water loss for the rice and winter wheat field using the measured daily e rate we first analyzed the relationship between e et and lai the missing daily e rate data for rice and winter wheat were then interpolated using the obtained correlations finally the total values of e at different growth stages and during the whole growing season were analyzed the breb system campbell scientific incorporated logan utah usa csi hereafter was installed in the southwest of the field 170 m long and 150 m wide for station 1 from mar 19 2016 and in the north of the field for station 2 210 m long and 100 m wide from nov 22 2017 the prevailing wind directions were both east northeast ene during the growing season of rice and winter wheat at station 1 while east southeast ese at station 2 net radiation rn w m 2 u m s 1 and wind direction were measured by a net radiometer model nr lite2 kipp zonen delft netherlands and wind sensor model 034b met one instruments inc oregon usa moi hereafter respectively both mounted at 2 0 m above the ground relative humidity rh and ta c at two heights 1 5 and 2 9 m above the ground were measured using two high precision temperature humidity sensors model 083e 1 moi with fan aspirated radiation shield model 076b moi the accuracy of sensors is 2 rh and 0 1 c for rh and ta respectively the measurement accuracy of rh and ta at two heights is crucial for breb method hence the two sensors were installed at the same height i e 1 5 m for 2 4 days to determine system bias between two sensors after the end of the each growth season for rice and winter wheat the vpd was calculated according to fao 56 based on the measurements of ta and rh at 1 5 m height allen et al 1998 surface water level hw m was measured by a pressure transducer model cs451 csi volumetric soil moisture θ cm3 cm 3 at 0 0 1 m depth was measured by using a soil water content reflectometer model cs616 csi and was calibrated using the oven drying method an infrared radiometer model si 111 apogee instruments inc logan utah usa oriented vertically downward was installed at a height of 0 1 m to measure the surface water temperature when water was present and soil surface temperature when water was absent soil heat flux gs w m 2 was measured by two heat flux plates model hfp01 hukseflux delft netherlands buried at depth of 0 05 and 0 08 m below the soil surface in the rice and winter wheat fields respectively four type t thermocouples model tt t 24 sle omega engineering inc stamford usa calibrated against type e thermocouple model tcav csi were used to measure soil temperatures ts c above the soil heat flux plates at the soil surface covered with some soil to avoid solar radiation heating and at a depth of 0 03 m below the ground for rice field and at a depth of 0 02 and 0 06 m for winter wheat field in line with each soil heat flux plate all data were stored by a data logger cr1000 csi every 5 s and 10 min averages were recorded the surface soil heat flux g w m 2 and water storage heat flux fw w m 2 were calculated as follows 1 g g s d t s d t h s ρ w c w θ ρ b c s 2 f w ρ w c w h w d t w d t where gs is the soil heat flux at a depth of 0 05 or 0 08 m average values of two sensors dts is the variation

for station 1 and 1530 kg m 3 for station 2 respectively cs and cw are the specific heat capacity for soil solid portion 840 j kg 1 k 1 and water 4190 j kg 1 k 1 respectively 2 2 breb method latent heat flux λet w m 2 can be estimated by combining the energy balance equation and bowen ratio equation 3 r n λ e t h g f w 4 β h λ e t where h is the sensible heat flux w m 2 λ is the heat of water vaporization j kg 1 β is the bowen ratio et is the evapotranspiration mm and fw is 0 when the surface water is absent combining eqs 3 and 4 the values of λet and h are given as 5 λ e t r n g f w 1 β 6

quality control according to the criteria proposed by perez et al 1999 the discarded inappropriate 10 min λet fluxes were then filled using a function of available energy rn g fw for rice and rn g for winter wheat linear regressions between 10 min λet and available energy were determined every 4 day interval and used to fill in the missing λet fluxes the energy balance method were then used to fill in the missing h h rn g fw λet the matlab code for data quality control and data interpolation could be found in the supplemental materials as well as in the github https github com shuilibite tab repositories 2 3 path analysis method the basic calculated process of path analysis method is as follows the method assumes there are n independent variables x1 x2 x3 xn and one dependent variable y if the correlation coefficient between each independent variable is rij and the direct path coefficient from xi to y is piy then the indirect path coefficient from xi to y through xj is rij pjy therefore the correlation coefficient riy between xi and y can be divided by direct path coefficient and sum of indirect path coefficient as 8 r i y p i y j i n r i j p j y i 1 2 n then we further define decision coefficient r i 2 as follows yuan et al 2001 9 r i 2 p i y 2 2 j i p i y r i j p j y 2 p i y r i y p i y 2 the r i 2 is a comprehensive index to assess the effect of xi on y with the order of r i 2 we can determine the main decision and limited variables the positive decision coefficient represents active effect of independent variable to dependent variable while negative value has inhibited effect in this study we selected 10 min et of rice and winter wheat as dependent variable and rn ta at 1 5 m height vpd and u at 10 min interval as independent variables to determine the main controlling meteorological factors on short term et the spss software version 21 0 ibm corp armonk ny was used to calculate pearson correlation coefficient between each two meteorological factors and between et and each meteorological factor correlations part of the output should tick descriptives of the statistic option for analysis and direct path coefficient standard coefficients column in output of coefficients part using linear regression analysis these values were then shown in a path chart from the figure the indirect path coefficients and decision coefficients could be easily calculated using eqs 8 and 9 2 4 modified pt model the pt model estimates et as follows 10 λ e t α e δ δ γ r n g f w where αe is the bulk pt coefficient varying under different underlying surfaces δ is the slope of saturation water vapour pressure relationship with ta kpa k 1 and increased as ta increased allen et al 1998 the et can be divided into transpiration tr and e and can be estimated based on the received available energy flux 11 λ t r α c δ δ γ r n c 12 λ e s α s δ δ γ r n s g f w where rnc and rns are the received energy flux by canopy and soil or water surface respectively determined as 13 r n s τ r n r n c 1 τ r n 14 τ e x p k lai where τ is the fraction of rn transmission reaching the soil or water surface and k is the canopy extinction coefficient the reported measurement methods of k are either using a portable quantum flux sensor or a portable rn sensor there should have some differences between two coefficients when using these two sensors while measurement by the portable rn sensor was rarely reported since there is good relationship between rn w m 2 and par umol m 2 s 1 par 2 387r n r2 0 95 the k measured using two sensors may be not differ significantly in this study the reported literature values 0 45 for rice hossen et al 2012 alberto et al 2014 and 0 70 for winter wheat olesen et al 2004 zhang et al 2008b were used αc and αs are the coefficients for tr and e respectively given as 15 α c 1 f s f t α c 0 α s f s w α s 0 where fsw is the index of soil water stress for soil evaporation determined as ding et al 2013 16 f s w s e s e 0

of fsw equaled to se only in several days for rice while in most of time for winter wheat ft is the plant temperature constraint determined as yao et al 2013 ershadi et al 2014 ai and yang 2016 17 f t

analytical expression for αe g fw should be expressed as a fraction of rns 21 g f w f g r n s where fg is the fraction of g fw to rns 0 51 for winter wheat where fw 0 and 0 36 for rice based on the

variations of monthly meteorological conditions i e rn ta vpd and u during the whole growing seasons of the rice wheat rotation system are shown in fig 1 the monthly total values of rn ranged from 5 4 to 395 5 mj m 2 for the rice field and varied from 15 2 to 285 8 mj m 2 for the winter wheat field obviously more energy flux was received over the rice field which was 1 6 times higher than that over the winter wheat field compared to winter wheat plants rice plants were grown in much hotter and more humid conditions as indicated by higher ta 10 c on average and greater rh 9 rh on average correspondingly the average value of vpd was 31 greater in the rice field than that in the winter wheat field the values of measured monthly u varied from 0 69 to 1 52 m s 1 for the rice field and ranged from 1 08 to 1 63 m s 1 for the winter wheat field the maximum monthly values of rn ta and vpd were observed in jul or aug for the rice while in apr or may for the winter wheat 3 2 variation of et and e in the rice wheat rotation system 3 2 1 diurnal variation of et fig 2 shows the diurnal variation of et in the rice wheat rotation system in different months in general the diurnal variation of et rate exhibited a single peak curve which started to increase as rn increased with its maximum around middle day varying in different months for different crops and then decreased until sunset at night the et rate was very low and the values were negative in some months due to condensation during the night li et al 2008 the maximum et rate in each month varied from 0 21 0 90 mm h 1 for rice and ranged from 0 08 0 42 mm h 1 for winter wheat the high et rates appeared in jul and aug for rice while in apr and may followed by mar for winter wheat which mainly contributed to high rn and vpd in these months fig 1 generally the et rates for rice were greater than that for winter wheat as a result of the wetter soil surface flooding in most of time more energy flux received and hotter environment in the rice field 3 2 2 seasonal and interannual variation of et and e the seasonal variations of daily et e rate lai and water inputs for the rice wheat rotation system are displayed in fig 3 the daily et rate of rice started to increase from the initial stage with its maximum rate 7 00 11 87 mm d 1 at the crop development stage and then decreased until the end of the season fig 3b d f table 3 based on the literature summary table 4 the peak daily et rate ranged from 5 5 to 12 8 mm d 1 in different regions e g china india philippine japan usa spain thailand brazil namibia cambodia bangladesh in the similar climate zone nearby our experiment site i e kunshang china with similar growth period the maximum daily et rate of 8 0 10 5 mm d 1 were observed by using eddy covariance and lysimeter methods liu et al 2017 xu et al 2017 which was close to this study the et for rice was mainly consumed at the crop development and middle stages accounting for 65 87 of total seasonal et as a result of frequent precipitation at the initial and late stages in the 2016 season the daily average et rate of rice at these two stages was lower than that in the 2017 and 2018 seasons fig 3 b d table 3 the total et of rice over the whole growing season was 479 8 561 3 and 527 1 mm for the 2016 2017 and 2018 seasons respectively these values were within the range of the total seasonal et reported in india philippine and southern china but greater than the water consumption reported in japan bangladesh and brazil and less than the values observed in california of usa spain namibia and northern china table 4 the differences between the total seasonal et observed from different studies in different regions may result from the differences in growth periods cultivars et measurement methods table 4 crop management and meteorological conditions zhang et al 2010 2011 the average daily et rate for rice over the growing season was 3 27 4 13 mm d 1 table 3 which was within the range of values reported by most of other research table 4 zhao et al 2008 reported a low average daily et rate of 2 76 2 84 mm d 1 for rice measured by eddy covariance method in sanjiang plain china however a high average daily et rate of 4 76 5 05 mm d 1 for rice was observed using water balance method nearby our experiment site shao et al 2014 evaporation rate is high for rice at the initial stage when lai was low reaching its maximum values of 4 90 5 28 and 5 76 mm d 1 for the 2016 2017 and 2018 seasons respectively fig 3 b d f after rice plants grew rapidly e rate started to decrease as the canopy coverage increased during the late season of 2016 the e was lowest because of frequent precipitation and high canopy coverage table 3 fig 3 the seasonal average e rate in the 2016 2017 and 2018 seasons was 0 86 0 95 and 1 06 mm d 1 respectively which was similar to the previous estimated values 0 99 1 04 mm d 1 by hossen et al 2012 however alberto et al 2014 showed the estimated average seasonal e rate of rice was 1 75 1 93 mm d 1 in laguna philippines and batchelor and roberts 1983 reported an even larger seasonal average e rate of 2 11 mm d 1 in sri lanka for winter wheat the daily et rate was low during winter from then on et rate started to increase reaching its maximum value of 5 57 and 4 97 mm d 1 at the middle or late stage for the 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 seasons respectively fig 3 the peak daily value was slightly greater than the values reported by kang et al 2003 4 5 mm d 1 and tyagi et al 2000a 4 6 mm d 1 but considerably lower than the reported values in other literature 7 12 mm d 1 table 4 the daily average et of winter wheat was 1 50 1 65 mm d 1 within the values reported in northern china 1 46 2 27 mm d 1 table 4 the total seasonal et of winter wheat was 285 4 and 279 4 mm for the 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 seasons respectively which was in agreement with the previous results by dar et al 2017 while less than the values reported in numerous studies table 4 for instance the reported total et of winter wheat over whole growing season in north china was 347 551 mm liu et al 2002 kang et al 2003 sun et al 2006 chen et al 2007 gao et al 2009 liu and luo 2010 liu et al 2011 zhang et al 2013 cui et al 2018 wang et al 2018 several reasons may lead to the difference in et between the north and yangtze river basin of china firstly more precipitation may lead to reduced solar radiation in the yangtze river basin which resulted in lower et rate secondly heavy or continuous rain sometimes occurred during harvesting time of rice which also delayed the planting date of winter wheat therefore the growth period of winter wheat in this area was shorter than that in northern china which had an inhibited effect on crop growth and canopy coverage in addition different measurement methods may also contribute to the difference unlike rice the e rate of winter wheat was high at the beginning declined during the winter season and then started to increase from the spring as et increased fig 3 the total e of winter wheat over the growing season was 136 and 142 mm for 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 seasons respectively which was in accordance with the values reported by kang et al 2003 sun et al 2006 and chen et al 2007 without mulching on average the total seasonal et of rice was 45 greater compared to winter wheat while the total seasonal e was almost the same 3 3 relationship between e et and lai and et partitioning with measured e et and lai of three years data a significant exponential function was proposed between e et of rice and lai with high coefficient of determination r2 of 0 87 as shown in fig 4 a 23 e et exp b lai where b is the specific canopy coefficient equal to 0 49 in this study for winter wheat a significant negative linear relationship between e et and lai was observed with r2 of 0 59 as shown in fig 4b 24 e et 0 093lai 0 70 although eq 23 was used to estimate e of rice in several studies hossen et al 2012 alberto et al 2014 the equation was not verified the ratio of e et was affected by lai available soil surface water content and coverage type sepaskhah and ilampour 1995 kato et al 2004 eberbach et al 2011 zhang et al 2011 since water was not limited for rice e et for rice was mainly dominated by the energy flux received by water or soil surface and coverage type the value of b in this study is close to the value of extinction coefficient hossen et al 2012 alberto et al 2014 while the value of b was high for other crops when soil surface was dry e g 1 25 for sorghum kato et al 2004 0 62 for cotton al khafaf et al 1978 and 0 75 for cowpea sepaskhah and ilampour 1995 after gap filling of the missing daily e rate for rice and winter wheat using eqs 23 and 24 the partitioning of the et was analyzed evaporation was the dominant portion of et for rice at the initial stage accounting for 74 86 of et after that it dropped to 11 25 at the other stages as the canopy coverage or lai increased table 3 the e et of rice over the whole growing season was 23 32 which was within the range of reported values 29 36 by batchelor and roberts 1983 and hossen et al 2012 however alberto et al 2014 reported a high e et of 40 47 in laguna the philippines for winter wheat the e et was 69 at the initial stage as the canopy coverage increased e et decreased to 31 39 at the middle stage and increased to 44 at the late stage the average e et during whole growing season for winter wheat was 48 51 close to the value reported by eberbach and pala 2005 but greater than values observed in northern china table 4 3 4 controlling meteorological factors of 10 min et for rice and winter wheat the direct path correlations between 10 min et of rice and winter wheat and meteorological factors i e rn ta vpd and u and the correlations between each meteorological factor are shown in fig 5 the correlation between ta and vpd was the highest for vpd calculated from ta and rh followed by rn and vpd rn and ta this result was in agreement with the findings by zhang et al 2016 although the values of correlation among meteorological factors were somehow different table 5 shows the path analysis results of 10 min et of rice and winter wheat and each meteorological factor due to direct and indirect action of each meteorological factor the order of the correlations between et of rice and winter wheat and meteorological factors was u ta vpd rn the direct action of rn on et was greatest and the indirect effect of rn on et was mainly through the path of vpd on et the direct effect of ta on et was negative therefore the influence of ta on et was mainly through indirect path of rn and vpd on et the similar results were also observed for vpd and u on et while the indirect effect was mainly through path of rn on et among meteorological factors only the direct path coefficient of rn on et was greater than the total indirect path coefficient showing that the effect of rn on et was mainly through direct effect while other meteorological factors were mainly through indirect effect the high decision coefficient of rn indicated that rn was the main decision factor affecting et table 5 which is in agreement with the results of alberto et al 2014 this finding may not be surprising since high solar radiation not only lead to the variation of ta and rh but also induces stomata opening to enhance transpiration in addition vpd is another factor affecting et as it represents the comprehensive effect of ta and rh which may affect the opening of stomata zhang et al 2016 however the indirect effect of vpd on et through path of rn is dominant table 5 the negative values of decision coefficient for ta show that the ta was the limiting factor for et of rice and winter wheat high ta in summer for rice or low ta in winter for winter wheat may have negative effects on et this result can provide a basis for using modified pt model considering ta comparing the path analysis results for rice and winter wheat the direct path correlation of rn on et for rice was slightly less than that for winter wheat indicating that the direct action of rn on et for rice was less the total indirect path coefficients of each parameter for rice were greater than that for wheat showing that the indirect action of each parameter for et of rice was large the vpd may have a greater impact on et for rice than for winter wheat as indicated by the large value of the decision coefficient for vpd 3 5 et calculation using the modified pt model based on the dynamic pt coefficient considering fsw ft and fs the modified pt model was evaluated the model was not applied to rice in 2017 because the rice field experienced advection and the model generally performs well under minimum advection sumner and jacobs 2005 ershadi et al 2014 for other years good agreement was observed between the measured and estimated et using the modified pt model for rice and winter wheat fig 6 the linear regression coefficients were 0 93 1 09 and 1 05 1 07 for rice and winter wheat respectively and the r2 ranged between 0 92 0 96 indicating most of the total variance of the measured values was explained by the model the mean absolute error and root mean square error were 17 2 21 4 w m 2 and 28 9 39 1 w m 2 for rice respectively while 15 0 15 5 w m 2 and 26 2 27 3 w m 2 for winter wheat these results indicate that the modified pt model could estimate et reasonably for rice and winter wheat in the yangtze river basin of china the modified pt model was widely used and performed well for many crops such as maize ding et al 2013 and cotton ai and yang 2016 pasture sumner and jacobs 2005 and mixed land cover types fisher et al 2008 yao et al 2013 ershadi et al 2014 where αe was modified by a combination of various factors such as soil mulching lai solar radiation soil water content green canopy fraction surface wetness ta and rh to evaluate the sensitivity of modified pt model to the uncertainties in the values of input parameters such as ta linked to ft swc linked to fsw fs and lai the percentage variation in the estimated total seasonal et was calculated we set the values of input parameters varied by 30 in this study the sensitive analysis showed that the model for rice was sensitive to ta with deviation of 6 12 while insensitive to fs and swc because the high et rate of rice mainly occurred before the late stage fig 2 and soil surface water was not limited in most of time the lai also had little effect on the model for rice with the deviation of 0 7 for winter wheat the model was insensitive to fs and lai but sensitive to ta deviation of 7 8 9 1 and swc at 0 0 1 m deviation of 4 4 9 9 garcía et al 2013 also showed that ft and fsw was the most sensitive parameters for modified pt model for an open woody savannah and mediterranean grassland to further evaluate the effect of ft or fsw on et the αe under varying lai was calculated with different values of ft 1 0 8 0 5 for rice and different values of ft 1 0 5 and fsw 1 0 7 0 for winter wheat fig 7 the results showed that αe was reduced for lower ft or fsw under the same lai when ft decreased from 1 0 to 0 5 under non limited surface soil water fsw 1 conditions αe decreased as lai increased and the mean αe decreased by 37 1 and 41 7 for rice and winter wheat respectively when ta was optimum ft 1 and fsw decreased from 1 to 0 αe increased as lai increased but the mean αe was reduced by 16 7 for winter wheat which is in agreement with the finding by ding et al 2013 for maize fig 7 also showed that αe varied considerably before soil or water surface was not fully covered by canopy especially when lai 1 0 4 conclusions in this study the seasonal variation of et in a rice wheat rotation system measured by the breb method et partition and controlling meteorological factors of et were investigated based on the measured et a modified pt model was evaluated the results showed that the seasonal et of the rice wheat rotation system was 765 841 mm the et for rice was mainly consumed by transpiration accounting for 68 77 of total seasonal et by contrast e accounted for 48 51 of total seasonal et for winter wheat et partitioning was mainly controlled by lai a significant exponential relationship for rice and linear relationship for winter wheat between e et and lai was well established the rn was the dominant meteorological factor affecting short term et through the direct effect followed by vpd mainly through an indirect effect the direct action of rn on et for rice was less while the indirect action of rn ta vpd and u on et was greater for rice than for winter wheat the modified pt model considering the effects of fsw ft and fs could estimate et of the rice wheat rotation system reasonably and was sensitive to the fsw or ft acknowledgements we are grateful for the research grants from the national natural science foundation of china

10894,the pressure of the water supply is controlled to a negative value relying on soil matric suction and is called negative pressure irrigation npi a subsurface irrigation method used to improve water use efficiency however the impacts of initial soil water conditions and emitter hydraulic conductivity on water movement under npi remain unknown to study the effects of irrigation management parameters on water movement under npi 300 scenarios using different soil textures initial soil matric potentials emitter hydraulic conductivities negative pressure inside emitter and time were simulated using the hydrus 2d software package the effects of these variables on water movement under npi were analyzed following the simulations and a empirical model was created to quantify the cumulative water supply based on initial soil matric potential emitter hydraulic conductivity negative pressure inside emitter and time the results showed that the cumulative water supply increased as the emitter hydraulic conductivity increased or initial soil matric potential decreased the relationships between the cumulative water supply and both the hydraulic conductivity of the emitter wall and the absolute value of the initial soil matric potential were logarithmic cumulative water supply had exponential and linear relationships with the absolute value of the negative pressure inside emitter and time respectively the empirical model created to quantify the cumulative water supply under npi yielded estimations that were in good agreement with the measured values therefore this

textures followed the order silt loam loam loamy sand compared to surface irrigation there are sharp differences in soil water infiltration under different initial soil moistures in subsurface irrigation gil et al 2008 shani and or 1995 shani et al 1996 teng et al 2016 therefore the influence of initial soil moisture cannot be ignored however there are few studies concerning the impact of initial soil water conditions and emitter hydraulic conductivity on water movement under npi the extent to which npi controls water in the crop root zone in terms of the cumulative water and wetted zone are critical yet understudied features of npi studies have established quantitative relationships between cumulative water supply and various irrigation parameters to determine the optimal position and pressure for subsurface positive pressure irrigation gil et al 2011 hou et al 2014 lazarovitch et al 2006 gil et al 2011 used an index equation to express the relationship between the emitter working pressure head and irrigation rate hou et al 2014 combined the soil clay content soil bulk density and initial soil water content into gils equation and established an equation describing the rate of irrigation that could be used in production lazarovitch et al 2006 found that a buildup of pressure in the soil restricts water transmission away from the dripper the extent of discharge depends on the soil type the dripper nominal discharge cavities near the dripper outlet and the hydraulic properties of the drip system they developed a coupled model to predict the irrigation rate of subsurface drip irrigation using irrigation pressure emitter discharge soil hydraulic properties and the cavity radius as variables gil et al 2010 the npi emitter is installed underground similar to that in positive pressure subsurface irrigation however the unsaturated soil water movement under npi results in a smaller supply of water compared to positive pressure subsurface irrigation methods consequently the cumulative supply of water is difficult to determine using the simple methods developed for positive pressure subsurface irrigation to date little research has focused on determining the relationships between npi cumulative water supply and different irrigation parameters such as soil texture wang et al 2016 2017 hydrus 2d was developed to model water solute and heat movement in saturated and unsaturated media šimůnek et al 1999 and has been used widely to simulate a variety of irrigation methods mguidiche et al 2015 qi et al 2018 lekakis and antonopoulos 2015 simulation of soil water movement under subsurface irrigation with porous ceramic emitter is mostly positive pressure irrigation and water movement under the action of gravity potential energy cai et al 2017 2019 siyal and skaggs 2009a npi relies on soil matric suction water movement different from above research however little research concerning soil water movement under npi therefore we used hydrus 2d in this study to simulate water movement under npi based on these gaps in knowledge related to npi the present study was conducted with two main objectives first we examined the effects of the negative pressure inside emitter the initial soil matric potential and the hydraulic conductivity of the emitter wall on the cumulative npi water supply in different soil textures second we developed an empirical model to quantify the cumulative water supply under npi the results of this study can be used to provide a scientific basis for the development and management of npi devices and a reliable tool for future applications of npi 2 materials and methods 2 1 irrigation system the npi system consisted of three components a negative pressure generator a water tank and an irrigation emitter fig 1 the latter comprised a 23 cm long porous clay pipe with inner and outer diameters of 10 and 18 mm respectively during irrigation the negative pressure inside emitter was controlled solely by the negative pressure generator the heavy liquid type negative pressure valve installation on water tank the irrigation system activates when the porous clay pipe is placed into dry soil during irrigation water from the filled tank encounters the low potential of soil water through micropores in the emitter and is sockend into soil consequently water levels in the tank decrease d is the descent height of water level and pressure correspondingly decreases however when pressure less than generator control pressure air then enters the water tank through the negative pressure generator balancing the pressure in the water tank with atmospheric pressure crop roots proceed to absorb irrigated water from the soil thus lowering the soil water potential this results in water movement from high potential regions in the irrigation container to low potential regions in soil through the npi emitter irrigation is terminated when the soil water potential is equal to the negative pressure inside emitter and it resumes once sufficient crop root water uptake occurs which lowers the soil water potential again 2 2 hydrus simulations 2 2 1 numerical modelling theory npi represents a type of linear source flow because of the symmetry along the vertical axis and uniformity in the horizontal direction of the emitter wall thus water flow can be viewed as two dimensional when the soil conditions are assumed to be homogeneous and isotropic soil water from the porous ceramic emitter into the soil was simulated using hydrus 2d software package version 2 03 šimůnek et al 2016 water flow in unsaturated rigid and isotropic porous media can be described by richards equation richards 1931 soil properties require highly non linear water retention θ h and hydraulic conductivity k h functions in this study we used the van genuchten 1980 retention model 2 2 2 system geometry in these simulations only the right side of the emitter vertical cross section was simulated cote et al 2003 siyal and skaggs 2009a b 2013 fig 2 illustrates the emitter namely clay pipe which was located on the left side of an otherwise rectangular computational domain at a 15 cm depth the emitter wall was modeled as a 4 mm thick semicircular wall which was set by the material distribution in the flow domain the flow domain was discretized with 17 708 nodes and 34 946 triangular elements the finite element mesh was generated using the established automatic triangulation algorithm in hydrus 2d 2 2 3 initial and boundary conditions if the initial soil water matric potential is distributed uniformly fig 2 the initial conditions are as follows 1 h x z t h 0 x z t 0 where h0 is the initial soil water matric potential cm x is the horizontal coordinate cm z positive upward is the vertical coordinate cm and t is the duration of water supply h the clay pipe internal boundary nodes of ab was assigned a constant negative pressure namely constant negative water head fig 2 the upper boundary ee had an atmospheric boundary condition where the water evapotranspiration fluxes was considered to be 0 4 cm d 1 siyal and skaggs 2009a cai et al 2017 marrou et al 2013 gallardo et al 1996 elamri et al 2018 rainfall and daily variations of evapotranspire rate were not considered no flow conditions and free drainage were also assumed at the sides ef and e f and bottom ff respectively 2 2 4 emitter hydraulic properties the saturation hydraulic conductivity kp0 residual water content θ r and saturated water content θ s of the clay pipe material were measured in the laboratory and kp0 was determined using the falling head method described by siyal et al 2009b we found that the pipe wall region water content remained stable throughout the simulations and that the simulated results did not differ substantially when various α values were used thus the other clay pipe hydraulic properties α n and l were similar to those in siyal and skaggs 2009a table 1 2 2 5 root water uptake the spatial root distribution is defined in hydrus 2d according to vrugt et al 2001 we considered a simple root distribution model in which the roots of lettuce lactuca sativa var ramosa hort were concentrated largely below the soil surface the plant was located above the emitter and the locations of the maximum root water uptake from the soil surface in the vertical direction and from the plant position in the horizontal direction were 25 and 15 cm where water was applied toshifumi et al 2002 the reduction in root water uptake due to water stress was described using the piecewise linear relationship developed by feddes et al 1978 the parameters were taken from the hydrus 2d soil catalogue for the lettuce tests 2 2 6 simulation scenarios to address the main objectives of this study we evaluated 300 alternative scenarios table 2 this study focused on four factors the negative pressure inside emitter h the initial water matric potential of the soil h0 the hydraulic conductivity kp of the pipe wall and the duration t of water supply kp was set at 0 1 1 and 10 times the value of kp0 h and h0 were in the range of 100 to 20 cm and 10000 to 200 cm respectively for different simulation scenario times five common soil textures silty loam sil loam l sandy loam sl clay loam cl and clay c were considered and the soil parameters were taken from the hydrus 2d soil catalogue to test soil type 2 3 hydrus 2d model validation experiment the irrigation system was connected to a special soil bin internal dimensions 23 cm 60 cm 80 cm made of 5 mm thick clear polymethyl methacrylate fig 1 we validated the hydrus 2d simulations of water movement through loam at the h of 50 and 100 cm during soil packing the irrigation emitter was placed approximately 15 cm from the soil surface and to keep only the right side of the emitter in contact with the soil plant two leaves a heart lettuce above the emitter with distance of 7 5 cm experimental soil containing sand 49 31 0 05 mm silt 29 38 0 05 0 002 mm and clay 21 31 0 002 mm was used and loaded at a bulk density of 1 4 g cm 3 on the basis of that data hydraulic parameters for the soil bin experimental soil were estimated by the rosetta pedotransfer function model schaap leiji van genuchten 2001 in hydrus 2d wetting distances in the horizontal and vertical directions cumulative water supply q was obtained per hour for soil water in solid phase measurements at the end of the 24 h period measure method details same as wang 2017 by combining these data we were able to fine tune the parameters by a trial and error process 2 4 empirical model validation experiment for testing the practicality and reliability of empirical model results one group field application experiments were conducted in a greenhouse the greenhouse is located in the academy of agricultural sciences of china 116 3 n 39 9 e beijing china the region has a typical warm temperate humid continental monsoon climate the annual precipitation of 565 mm mean temperature of 10 12 the soil of the experiment is sandy loam with field capacity of 0 21 cm3 cm 3 the clay pipe horizontally buried at 15 cm two vegetables were selected with lettuce and pakchoi brassica campestris l ssp chinensis makino collected cumulative water supply under h of 50 and 100 cm at different time table 3 2 5 evaluation of the model results the model predictions were quantitatively evaluated using the normalized root mean square error nrmse defined as follows willmott 1982 2 n r m s e 1 n i 1 n p i o i 2 0 5 o where n is the number of data points p i is the simulated data from hydrus 2d or estimated data from the empirical model created in this study o i is the measured data from hydrus 2d or empirical model validation experiment and o is the mean value of the measured data nrmse values 0 10 indicate very good consistency between two results whereas nrmse values 0 30 indicate considerable deviation between two results the best nrmse values achieved herein ranged from 0 10 to 0 20 and most were between 0 20 and 0 30 the best experimental conditions yielded the smallest nrmse values shwetha and varija 2015 3 results 3 1 evaluation of the hydrus 2d model measured data obtained from soil bin experiment were used to verify the model effectiveness for simulating the soil water movement under npi the measured and simulated cumulative water supply soil water content and wetting distances in the horizontal and vertical directions coincided reasonably well which revealed a high prediction accuracy for hydrus 2d fig 3 the slopes and intercepts of the linear relations between the simulated and measured values were close to 1 and 0 respectively specifically the values of r2 were 0 97 0 97 and 0 99 for the four endpoints mentioned above respectively the nrmse values for the wetting distances and soil water contents were 0 20 i e 0 07 and 0 11 respectively and the nrmse values for the cumulative water supply was between 0 20 0 30 i e 0 22 thus we were confident that hydrus 2d could be used to accurately simulate water movement and cumulative water supply under npi in this study 3 2 effect of soil texture on cumulative water supply the cumulative water supplies in different soil textures were sil 5 04 l l 4 28 l cl 3 14 l sl 2 56 l c 1 37 l at h0 200 cm h 20 cm kp 0 1 kp0 and t 168 h the distribution of the soil water differed substantially among the wet zones of the five soil textures where c showed an even distribution and the largest increment was observed around the emitter in sil cl l and sl fig 4 the contour lines in fig 4 showed that the increment in soil water decreased largest with increasing distance from emitter in sl followed by l sil and cl because the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity was larger when soil moisture is higher and the water content was higher in soil with a greater clay content at the same h0 c 0 36 cm3 cm 3 cl 0 30 cm3 cm 3 sil 0 28 cm3 cm 3 l 0 19 cm3 cm 3 sl 0 10 cm3 cm 3 therefore water moved faster in soil textures with a greater clay content i e c cl sil l sl however this does not mean clay soils have more cumulative water supply under npi because that is also influenced by the soil water increment from θ h0 to θ h where θ h0 and θ h are the soil water contents at h0 and h given the large differences in the cumulative water supply and water distribution in different soil textures under npi li et al 2014 it is necessary to further study the effects of different irrigation management parameters on the npi cumulative water supply in various soil textures 3 3 effect of initial soil water conditions on cumulative water supply the npi cumulative water supply increased with decreasing h0 at constant h and kp values for example the water supply was 5 04 5 73 6 03 and 6 15 l respectively at h0 200 700 2700 and 10000 cm when h 20 cm kp 0 1 kp0 and t 168 h in sil the contour lines in fig 5 showed that the soil water content decreased fastest with increasing distance from the emitter in h0 10000 cm followed by 2700 700 and 200 these results showed that increased initial soil water matric potential resulted in larger unsaturated hydraulic conductivity under npi and faster water movement following water infiltration from the emitter in a given soil texture thereby increasing the water distribution zone fig 5 although the volume of wetting expanded slowly as h0 decreased more water was needed to increase the water matric potential in scenarios with lower h0 values at the same condition therefore the soil water supply increased as h0 decreased better correlations were noted between cumulative supply water and h0 the absolute value of h0 which showed logarithmic relationships except sl fig 7 the relative cumulative water supply values for different soils at different h0 values followed the order sil l sl cl c 3 4 effect of clay pipe wall hydraulic conductivity on cumulative water supply the cumulative npi water supply first increased rapidly and then slowed down when kp increased from 0 1 to 10 kp for the same soil texture h and h0 and t fig 7 logarithmic relationships were noted between cumulative supply water and kp meanwhile the water distribution zone increased with increasing kp fig 6 the relative cumulative water supply values for the different soils at different kp values followed the order sil l sl cl c at constant h and h0 it should be emphasized that when kp was smaller than the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil around the emitter which was regulated by different values between h and h0 kp had a greater effect on the water infiltration rate conversely when kp was larger than the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of soil the effect was smaller 3 5 effect of the negative pressure inside emitter on cumulative water supply the cumulative water supply increased with increasing h at a given kp and h0 under npi and the general tendencies between the five soil textures especially sil and l were significant fig 7 better correlations were noted between cumulative supply water and h the absolute value of h which exhibited an exponential relationship 3 6 effect of water supply duration on cumulative water supply the cumulative water supply increased with increasing water supply duration at given values of kp h and h0 under npi better correlations were noted between cumulative supply water and water supply duration which had linear relationships fig 7 the relative cumulative water supply values for different soils at different times followed the order sil l sl cl c at given kp h and h0 values 4 discussion in positive pressure irrigation there is a strong correlation between the positive pressure inside emitter and discharge the potential relationship between pressure and free discharge in orifices can be applied to dripper discharge under surface drip irrigation karmeli and keller 1975 3 q k p h x where q is dripper flow rate l h 1 and x is exponent one of the key differences between subsurface drip irrigation and surface drip irrigation is that soil properties could affect emitter discharge shani et al 1996 lazarovitch et al 2005 gil et al 2008 therefore if an overpressure develops at the discharge point of a buried emitter the hydraulic gradient across the emitter would decrease and the emitter flow rate would reduce rodríguez sinobas et al 2009 hou et al 2014 suggested that emitter discharge was influenced by soil clay content pressure inside emitter soil bulk density and initial soil moisture based on eq 3 an emitter discharge model was created for subsurface drip irrigation using the four effective variables factors listed above 4 q k m a γ b θ h 0 c h x where m is the clay 0 01 mm content γ is the soil bulk density g cm 3 k is an empirical coefficient and a b c and x are empirical indices in comparison npi a type of subsurface irrigation exhibits different variable relationships numerical simulations have shown that when soil texture and soil bulk density remain constant the major factors driving soil water movement are irrigation pressure initial soil water matric potential and emitter hydraulic conductivity ashrafi et al 2002 quantitative relationships exist between the water supply rate cumulative infiltration wetting body volume and other important factors e g negative pressure inside emitter in npi systems jiang et al 2004 the results showed that the cumulative water supply of npi increased with increase in h and decrease in h0 according to darcy s law jacob 1972 larger potential gradients result in greater fluxes and more cumulative water supply per unit time for given values of h and h0 the possible increment in water content is the difference from θ h0 to θ h larger differences between θ h and θ h0 result in more irrigation water needed to increase the soil water content therefore a single equation for npi was established to quantify the cumulative water supply using the four aforementioned variables according to similar construction method of eqs 3 and 4 as followed 5 q k h h 0 a k p b t c θ h θ h 0 d where q is the cumulative supply water l h h0 is the difference between the negative pressure inside emitter and the initial soil water matric potential which is a factor of energy drive θ h θ h0 represents the soil specific water capacity k is an empirical coefficient and a b c and d are empirical indices taking the log of both sides of eq 5 yields the following equation 6 ln q ln k a ln h h 0 b ln k p c ln t d ln θ h θ h 0 here simple letters are selected to represent the complex logarithms 7 ln q y ln k k ln h h 0 x 1 ln k p x 2 ln t x 3 ln θ h θ h 0 x 4 then eq 5 can be converted into a multiple linear regression function 8 y k a x 1 b x 2 c x 3 d x 4 in accordance with the data set table 2 a series of q values was obtained for the five soil textures using hydrus 2d simulations the k a b c and d values were obtained using regression calculations and were substituted into eq 5 from which a quantitative model eq 9 was determined for the cumulative supply water under npi 9 q 1 64 h h 0 0 17 k p 0 06 t 0 80 θ h θ h 0 1 14 these regression equations are significant and credible and the r2 of eq 9 was 0 67 the series of q values obtained using empirical model validation experiment table 3 was used to verify eq 9 the relationships between the measured values from experiment and estimated values from the empirical model are shown in fig 8 the slope of the linear relationship between the experiment measured values and empirical model estimated values was close to 1 with an r2 of 0 73 and nrmse of 0 22 consequently we believe that the agreement between the measured and estimated dates is acceptable overall the quantitative model generated to estimate the cumulative water supply works well under npi conditions and can be used in future npi applications 5 conclusions the effects of irrigation management parameters including soil conditions emitter wall hydraulic conductivity system irrigation pressure and time on water movement under npi were investigated a empirical model was created to quantify the cumulative water supply under npi using the following variables negative pressure inside emitter initial soil water matric potential emitter hydraulic conductivity and time we drew the following conclusions 1 the cumulative water supply increased with increasing the negative pressure inside emitter h absolute value of the initial soil water matric potential h0 hydraulic conductivity kp of the pipe wall and duration of water supply t as kp increased the cumulative water supply first increased rapidly and then increased more slowly the cumulative water supply exhibited logarithmic relationships with h0 and kp and was exponentially and linearly related to h and t respectively 2 based on the numerical simulation data from hydrus 2d a empirical model was created to quantify the cumulative water supply under npi based on the negative pressure inside emitter initial soil water matric potential pipe wall hydraulic conductivity and time the slope of the linear relationship between the measured values from the experiment and the estimated values from the empirical model was close to 1 with an r2 of 0 73 and nrmse of 0 22 the measured and estimated results were in good agreement these results indicate that the model can be applied to calculate water infiltration during npi supporting its applicability the model characteristics are simple and easy to calculate acknowledgments this project was supported by the national

10894,the pressure of the water supply is controlled to a negative value relying on soil matric suction and is called negative pressure irrigation npi a subsurface irrigation method used to improve water use efficiency however the impacts of initial soil water conditions and emitter hydraulic conductivity on water movement under npi remain unknown to study the effects of irrigation management parameters on water movement under npi 300 scenarios using different soil textures initial soil matric potentials emitter hydraulic conductivities negative pressure inside emitter and time were simulated using the hydrus 2d software package the effects of these variables on water movement under npi were analyzed following the simulations and a empirical model was created to quantify the cumulative water supply based on initial soil matric potential emitter hydraulic conductivity negative pressure inside emitter and time the results showed that the cumulative water supply increased as the emitter hydraulic conductivity increased or initial soil matric potential decreased the relationships between the cumulative water supply and both the hydraulic conductivity of the emitter wall and the absolute value of the initial soil matric potential were logarithmic cumulative water supply had exponential and linear relationships with the absolute value of the negative pressure inside emitter and time respectively the empirical model created to quantify the cumulative water supply under npi yielded estimations that were in good agreement with the measured values therefore this

fertilizer delivery it is appropriate for vegetable production in solar greenhouses abidin et al 2014 hack 1971 libby et al 2018 nalliah and ranjan 2010 a number of npi irrigation management parameters are crucial for determining the cumulative water supply and the wetting zone for example wang et al 2017 simulated water movement during npi using the hydrus 2d software package and found that soil wetting body volume soil water content and water infiltration increased with irrigation pressure and water supply time under npi shwetha and varija 2015 the relationship between npi

root water uptake the spatial root distribution is defined in hydrus 2d according to vrugt et al 2001 we considered a simple root distribution model in which the roots of lettuce lactuca sativa var ramosa hort were concentrated largely below the soil surface the plant was located above the emitter and the locations of the maximum root water uptake from the soil surface in the vertical direction and from the plant position in the horizontal direction were 25 and 15 cm where water was applied toshifumi et al 2002 the reduction in root water uptake due to water stress was described using the piecewise linear relationship developed by feddes et al 1978 the parameters were taken from the hydrus 2d soil catalogue for the lettuce tests 2 2 6 simulation scenarios to address the main objectives of this study we evaluated 300 alternative scenarios table 2 this study focused on four factors the negative pressure inside emitter h the initial water matric potential of the soil h0 the hydraulic conductivity kp of the pipe wall and the duration t of water supply kp was set at 0 1 1 and 10 times the value of kp0 h and h0 were in the range of 100 to 20 cm and 10000 to 200 cm respectively for different simulation scenario times five common soil textures silty loam sil loam l sandy loam sl clay loam cl and clay c were considered and the soil parameters were taken from the hydrus 2d soil catalogue to test soil type 2 3 hydrus 2d model validation experiment the irrigation system was connected to a special soil bin internal dimensions 23 cm 60 cm 80 cm made of 5 mm thick clear polymethyl methacrylate fig 1 we validated the hydrus 2d simulations of water movement through loam at the h of 50 and 100 cm during soil packing the irrigation emitter was placed approximately 15 cm from the soil surface and to keep only the right side of the emitter in contact with the soil plant two leaves a heart lettuce above the emitter with distance of 7 5 cm experimental soil containing sand 49 31 0 05 mm silt 29 38 0 05 0 002 mm and clay 21 31 0 002 mm was used and loaded at a bulk density of 1 4 g cm 3 on the basis of that data hydraulic parameters for the soil bin experimental soil were estimated by the rosetta pedotransfer function model schaap leiji van genuchten 2001 in hydrus 2d wetting distances in the horizontal and vertical directions cumulative water supply q was obtained per hour for soil water in solid phase measurements at the end of the 24 h period measure method details same as wang 2017 by combining these data we were able to fine tune the parameters by a trial and error process 2 4 empirical model validation experiment for testing the practicality and reliability of empirical model results one group field application experiments were conducted in a greenhouse the greenhouse is located in the academy of agricultural sciences of china 116 3 n 39 9 e beijing china the region has a typical warm temperate humid continental monsoon climate the annual precipitation of 565 mm mean temperature of 10 12 the soil of the experiment is sandy loam with field capacity of 0 21 cm3 cm 3 the clay pipe horizontally buried at 15 cm two vegetables were selected with lettuce and pakchoi brassica campestris l ssp chinensis makino collected cumulative water supply under h of 50 and 100 cm at different time table 3 2 5 evaluation of the model results the model predictions were quantitatively evaluated using the normalized root mean square error nrmse defined as follows willmott 1982 2 n r m s e 1 n i 1 n p i o i 2 0 5 o where n is the number of data points p i is the simulated data from hydrus 2d or estimated data from the empirical model created in this study o i is the measured data from hydrus 2d or empirical model validation experiment and o is the mean value of the measured data nrmse values 0 10 indicate very good consistency between two results whereas nrmse values 0 30 indicate considerable deviation between two results the best nrmse values achieved herein ranged from 0 10 to 0 20 and most were between 0 20 and 0 30 the best experimental conditions yielded the smallest nrmse values shwetha and varija 2015 3 results 3 1 evaluation of the hydrus 2d model measured data obtained from soil bin experiment were used to verify the model effectiveness for simulating the soil water movement under npi the measured and simulated cumulative water supply soil water content and wetting distances in the horizontal and vertical directions coincided reasonably well which revealed a high prediction accuracy for hydrus 2d fig 3 the slopes and intercepts of the linear relations between the simulated and measured values were close to 1 and 0 respectively specifically the values of r2 were 0 97 0 97 and 0 99 for the four endpoints mentioned above respectively the nrmse values for the wetting distances and soil water contents were 0 20 i e 0 07 and 0 11 respectively and the nrmse values for the cumulative water supply was between 0 20 0 30 i e 0 22 thus we were confident that hydrus 2d could be used to accurately simulate water movement and cumulative water supply under npi in this study 3 2 effect of soil texture on cumulative water supply the cumulative water supplies in different soil textures were sil 5 04 l l 4 28 l cl 3 14 l sl 2 56 l c 1 37 l at h0 200 cm h 20 cm kp 0 1 kp0 and t 168 h the distribution of the soil water differed substantially among the wet zones of the five soil textures where c showed an even distribution and the largest increment was observed around the emitter in sil cl l and sl fig 4 the contour lines in fig 4 showed that the increment in soil water decreased largest with increasing distance from emitter in sl followed by l sil and cl because the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity was larger when soil moisture is higher and the water content was higher in soil with a greater clay content at the same h0 c 0 36 cm3 cm 3 cl 0 30 cm3 cm 3 sil 0 28 cm3 cm 3 l 0 19 cm3 cm 3 sl 0 10 cm3 cm 3 therefore water moved faster in soil textures with a greater clay content i e c cl sil l sl however this does not mean clay soils have more cumulative water supply under npi because that is also influenced by the soil water increment from θ h0 to θ h where θ h0 and θ h are the soil water contents at h0 and h given the large differences in the cumulative water supply and water distribution in different soil textures under npi li et al 2014 it is necessary to further study the effects of different irrigation management parameters on the npi cumulative water supply in various soil textures 3 3 effect of initial soil water conditions on cumulative water supply the npi cumulative water supply increased with decreasing h0 at constant h and kp values for example the water supply was 5 04 5 73 6 03 and 6 15 l respectively at h0 200 700 2700 and 10000 cm when h 20 cm kp 0 1 kp0 and t 168 h in sil the contour lines in fig 5 showed that the soil water content decreased fastest with increasing distance from the emitter in h0 10000 cm followed by 2700 700 and 200 these results showed that increased initial soil water matric potential resulted in larger unsaturated hydraulic conductivity under npi and faster water movement following water infiltration from the emitter in a given soil texture thereby increasing the water distribution zone fig 5 although the volume of wetting expanded slowly as h0 decreased more water was needed to increase the water matric potential in scenarios with lower h0 values at the same condition therefore the soil water supply increased as h0 decreased better correlations were noted between cumulative supply water and h0 the absolute value of h0 which showed logarithmic relationships except sl fig 7 the relative cumulative water supply values for different soils at different h0 values followed the order sil l sl cl c 3 4 effect of clay pipe wall hydraulic conductivity on cumulative water supply the cumulative npi water supply first increased rapidly and then slowed down when kp increased from 0 1 to 10 kp for the same soil texture h and h0 and t fig 7 logarithmic relationships were noted between cumulative supply water and kp meanwhile the water distribution zone increased with increasing kp fig 6 the relative cumulative water supply values for the different soils at different kp values followed the order sil l sl cl c at constant h and h0 it should be emphasized that when kp was smaller than the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil around the emitter which was regulated by different values between h and h0 kp had a greater effect on the water infiltration rate conversely when kp was larger than the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of soil the effect was smaller 3 5 effect of the negative pressure inside emitter on cumulative water supply the cumulative water supply increased with increasing h at a given kp and h0 under npi and the general tendencies between the five soil textures especially sil and l were significant fig 7 better correlations were noted between cumulative supply water and h the absolute value of h which exhibited an exponential relationship 3 6 effect of water supply duration on cumulative water supply the cumulative water supply increased with increasing water supply duration at given values of kp h and h0 under npi better correlations were noted between cumulative supply water and water supply duration which had linear relationships fig 7 the relative cumulative water supply values for different soils at different times followed the order sil l sl cl c at given kp h and h0 values 4 discussion in positive pressure irrigation there is a strong correlation between the positive pressure inside emitter and discharge the potential relationship between pressure and free discharge in orifices can be applied to dripper discharge under surface drip irrigation karmeli and keller 1975 3 q k p h x where q is dripper flow rate l h 1 and x is exponent one of the key differences between subsurface drip irrigation and surface drip irrigation is that soil properties could affect emitter discharge shani et al 1996 lazarovitch et al 2005 gil et al 2008 therefore if an overpressure develops at the discharge point of a buried emitter the hydraulic gradient across the emitter would decrease and the emitter flow rate would reduce rodríguez sinobas et al 2009 hou et al 2014 suggested that emitter discharge was influenced by soil clay content pressure inside emitter soil bulk density and initial soil moisture based on eq 3 an emitter discharge model was created for subsurface drip irrigation using the four effective variables factors listed above 4 q k m a γ b θ h 0 c h x where m is the clay 0 01 mm content γ is the soil bulk density g cm 3 k is an empirical coefficient and a b c and x are empirical indices in comparison npi a type of subsurface irrigation exhibits different variable relationships numerical simulations have shown that when soil texture and soil bulk density remain constant the major factors driving soil water movement are irrigation pressure initial soil water matric potential and emitter hydraulic conductivity ashrafi et al 2002 quantitative relationships exist between the water supply rate cumulative infiltration wetting body volume and other important factors e g negative pressure inside emitter in npi systems jiang et al 2004 the results showed that the cumulative water supply of npi increased with increase in h and decrease in h0 according to darcy s law jacob 1972 larger potential gradients result in greater fluxes and more cumulative water supply per unit time for given values of h and h0 the possible increment in water content is the difference from θ h0 to θ h larger differences between θ h and θ h0 result in more irrigation water needed to increase the soil water content therefore a single equation for npi was established to quantify the cumulative water supply using the four aforementioned variables according to similar construction method of eqs 3 and 4 as followed 5 q k h h 0 a k p b t c θ h θ h 0 d where q is the cumulative supply water l h h0 is the difference between the negative pressure inside emitter and the initial soil water matric potential which is a factor of energy drive θ h θ h0 represents the soil specific water capacity k is an empirical coefficient and a b c and d are empirical indices taking the log of both sides of eq 5 yields the following equation 6 ln q ln k a ln h h 0 b ln k p c ln t d ln θ h θ h 0 here simple letters are selected to represent the complex logarithms 7 ln q y ln k k ln h h 0 x 1 ln k p x 2 ln t x 3 ln θ h θ h 0 x 4 then eq 5 can be converted into a multiple linear regression function 8 y k a x 1 b x 2 c x 3 d x 4 in accordance with the data set table 2 a series of q values was obtained for the five soil textures using hydrus 2d simulations the k a b c and d values were obtained using regression calculations and were substituted into eq 5 from which a quantitative model eq 9 was determined for the cumulative supply water under npi 9 q 1 64 h h 0 0 17 k p 0 06 t 0 80 θ h θ h 0 1 14 these regression equations are significant and credible and the r2 of eq 9 was 0 67 the series of q values obtained using empirical model validation experiment table 3 was used to verify eq 9 the relationships between the measured values from experiment and estimated values from the empirical model are shown in fig 8 the slope of the linear relationship between the experiment measured values and empirical model estimated values was close to 1 with an r2 of 0 73 and nrmse of 0 22 consequently we believe that the agreement between the measured and estimated dates is acceptable overall the quantitative model generated to estimate the cumulative water supply works well under npi conditions and can be used in future npi applications 5 conclusions the effects of irrigation management parameters including soil conditions emitter wall hydraulic conductivity system irrigation pressure and time on water movement under npi were investigated a empirical model was created to quantify the cumulative water supply under npi using the following variables negative pressure inside emitter initial soil water matric potential emitter hydraulic conductivity and time we drew the following conclusions 1 the cumulative water supply increased with increasing the negative pressure inside emitter h absolute value of the initial soil water matric potential h0 hydraulic conductivity kp of the pipe wall and duration of water supply t as kp increased the cumulative water supply first increased rapidly and then increased more slowly the cumulative water supply exhibited logarithmic relationships with h0 and kp and was exponentially and linearly related to h and t respectively 2 based on the numerical simulation data from hydrus 2d a empirical model was created to quantify the cumulative water supply under npi based on the negative pressure inside emitter initial soil water matric potential pipe wall hydraulic conductivity and time the slope of the linear relationship between the measured values from the experiment and the estimated values from the empirical model was close to 1 with an r2 of 0 73 and nrmse of 0 22 the measured and estimated results were in good agreement these results indicate that the model can be applied to calculate water infiltration during npi supporting its applicability the model characteristics are simple and easy to calculate acknowledgments this project was supported by the national
