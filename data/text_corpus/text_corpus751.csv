3755,the simulation optimization so method is the most widely used method for groundwater contaminant source identification however the heuristic optimization algorithms in the so method often rely on the selection of the initial point the initial estimate of each variable to be solved if the initial point is far from the actual value the convergence speed of the algorithm will be slow and it will easily converge prematurely it is challenging to obtain the accurate identification results of the contaminant source therefore providing a good initial point for the optimization algorithm is critical the ensemble kalman filter enkf algorithm has the advantages of a simple calculation process and fast running speed however when the inverse problem has a strong nonlinearity its identification accuracy still needs improvement this study combined the enkf and adaptive step length ant colony optimization asaco algorithms to construct an enkf asaco algorithm this was used to identify pollution source characteristics and simulation model parameters simultaneously first the enkf algorithm was adopted to provide a good initial point for the optimization algorithm on this basis the adaptive step length search strategy was used to improve the ant colony optimization aco algorithm and the asaco algorithm was obtained as a result the step length changed adaptively to avoid falling into the local optimum at the same time to reduce the substantial computational load caused by repeatedly calling the numerical simulation model the kriging method was used to establish a surrogate model of the simulation model finally the identification results of the enkf asaco algorithm were compared and analyzed with those of the enkf previous aco and asaco algorithms to verify the effectiveness of the proposed new algorithm the results show that compared with the three single algorithms the enkf asaco algorithm constructed in this study can speed up the convergence speed and significantly improve the search efficiency and identification accuracy additionally the enkf asaco algorithm was also applied in the scenario with measurement errors and its robustness and reliability were further verified keywords adaptive step length ant colony optimization ensemble kalman filter groundwater contaminant simultaneous identification surrogate model 1 introduction groundwater contaminant is characterized by the concealment of existence and lag of discovery this brings great difficulties to designing groundwater pollution remediation schemes risk assessment and responsibility determination li et al 2021 therefore the research on groundwater contaminant source identification gcsi is fundamental gcsi is based on the actual dynamic monitoring data water level and concentration and other auxiliary information such as field investigations and professional knowledge to inverse the mathematical simulation model describing groundwater contamination thus the aquifer s relevant information of groundwater contaminant sources can be identified including the number spatial location and release history there are many theories and methods to solve the problems of gcsi including the simulation optimization so method simulation random statistics srs method and kalman filter kf method etc in the so method the simulation model is embedded into the optimization model as an equality constraint condition the deviation between the output results of the simulation model and the actual observed data is taken as the objective function and the optimization algorithm is used to solve the optimization model continuously finally the optimal solution can be found to minimize the objective function value xing et al 2019 among them the optimization algorithms are the key which can be divided into the non heuristic optimization algorithms and heuristic optimization algorithms at present the heuristic algorithms are widely used in gcsi such as the genetic algorithm aral et al 2001 mahinthakumar and sayeed 2005 singh and datta 2006 simulated annealing algorithm jha and datta 2013 yeh et al 2007 and particle swarm optimization algorithm guneshwor et al 2018 zhao et al 2020 among others the so method has a strong optimization ability but it cannot consider the uncertainty of solutions zhang et al 2015 moreover the heuristic optimization algorithms usually rely on initial point selection and will easily fall into the local optimum in the srs method the objective is to maximize the posterior probability of unknown variables under given observed data xu et al 2021 some approaches adopted for this objective are minimum relative entropy cupola et al 2015a woodbury and ulrych 1996 the geostatistical approach butera et al 2013 cupola et al 2015b michalak and kitanidis 2004 or bayesian approaches pirot et al 2019 zanini and woodbury 2016 the srs method can evaluate the uncertainty of unknown variables still this method usually requires a large computational load especially when dealing with a high dimensional problem and the search efficiency may become low in the kf method the covariance is used to describe the relationship between states or parameters and states the covariance and observed data are used to update states or parameters the kf method is based on linear estimation theory and has the advantage of small computation it was originally used to solve linear problems kalman 1960 later it was developed and improved to solve nonlinear problems evensen 1994 papanastassiou 1992 however when the kf method deals with a strong nonlinear problem its identification accuracy still needs improvement each method has its advantages and limitations the so method is the most widely used method in the above three methods to solve the gcsi problems ayvaz 2010 mirghani et al 2009 the ant colony optimization aco algorithm is a new bionic optimization algorithm to simulate the foraging behavior of ants li et al 2010 this algorithm was used to solve the combinatorial optimization problems previously dorigo 1992 later research development has been gradually improved and applied to solve continuous optimization problems bilchev and parmee 1995 socha and dorigo 2008 it has been widely used in many fields but few people have applied it to the gcsi in this study it has been applied to the identification of the groundwater contaminant source however heuristic algorithms such as the aco algorithm still rely on initial point selection initial estimate of each variable to be solved if the initial point is far from the actual value the convergence speed of the algorithm will be slow and it easily converges prematurely it is difficult to obtain accurate identification results of the contaminant source some researchers embedded the homotopy algorithm into the optimization algorithm to solve this problem hou et al 2021 li et al 2021 however the homotopy algorithm will significantly increase the time cost evensen 1994 proposed the ensemble kalman filter enkf which is a kind of kf method by generating a parameter ensemble based on a monte carlo sampling strategy to approximate the probability distribution of parameters sun et al 2020 enkf and some of its variants have been widely used in gcsi in recent years ju et al 2018 li et al 2012 todaro et al 2021 xu and gomez hernandez 2016 xu and gomez hernandez 2018 the enkf algorithm has the advantages of a simple calculation process and fast running speed moreover it can consider the uncertainty of parameters since the final outcome is always the form of ensemble chen et al 2018 wang et al 2019 however when the inverse problem has a strong nonlinearity its identification accuracy still needs improvement therefore the combination of the enkf and optimization algorithms is considered to further learn from each other the enkf algorithm was adopted to select the initial point and provide a better initial point for the optimization algorithm on the one hand the optimization algorithm can make up for the optimization ability of the enkf algorithm on the other hand the enkf algorithm can speed up the convergence of the optimization algorithm and avoid falling into the local optimum therefore combining the two algorithms in this way can improve the overall search efficiency although it is essential to provide a good initial point for the optimization algorithm to improve the aco algorithm s search efficiency further this study used the adaptive step length search strategy and obtained an adaptive step length ant colony optimization asaco algorithm the search step length in the early stage was larger and the search range was wider the search step length in the later stage was smaller and the search was more refined furthermore the step length changed adaptively to speed up the convergence and to make it difficult to fall into a local optimum the enkf and optimization algorithms need to repeatedly call the simulation model in the subsequent applications generating a huge computational load hou et al 2016 therefore this is a very effective way to solve this problem by establishing a surrogate model of the simulation model li et al 2020 the surrogate model can approximate the input output relationship of the simulation model with a small calculation load and maintain a high accuracy asher et al 2015 the kriging surrogate model has been widely used due to its flexibility and efficiency kleijnen 2017 but in the past research few people have combined it with the enkf in this study the kriging surrogate model was used in combination with the enkf and asaco algorithms to improve the efficiency of contaminant source identification this study constructed an enkf asaco algorithm which was used to identify the characteristics of the pollution source and simulation model parameters simultaneously firstly the enkf algorithm was adopted for identification and the identification results were regarded as the initial point of the optimization algorithm on this basis the adaptive step length search strategy was used to improve the aco algorithm and the asaco algorithm was obtained the step length changed adaptively to speed up the convergence and avoid falling into the local optimum at the same time to reduce the huge computational load caused by repeatedly calling the numerical simulation model the kriging method was used to establish a surrogate model of the simulation model finally the identification results of the enkf asaco algorithm were compared with those of the enkf previous aco and asaco algorithms to verify the effectiveness of the proposed new algorithm additionally to further test its robustness and reliability in the real scenario the enkf asaco algorithm was also applied to a scenario where there were measurement errors in the observed data the rest of this article is organized as follows section 2 describes the necessary details of the methods used in this article section 3 describes the details of the hypothetical case and implementation steps then in section 4 the results of the algorithms are compared and discussed finally some conclusions are given in section 5 2 methodology 2 1 the simulation model the groundwater numerical simulation model includes the groundwater flow and solute transport models the latter is established based on the former the governing partial differential equation of two dimensional stabilized flow in a confined aquifer is expressed as follows singh and datta 2006 1 x i t ij h x j w i j 1 2 where x i x j are the cartesian coordinates t ij is the transmissivity tensor s component h is the hydraulic head and w is the volumetric flux per unit area the governing partial differential equation of the groundwater solute transport is singh and datta 2006 zhao et al 2016 2 θ c t x i θ d ij c x j x i θ c v i c s w d i j 1 2 where θ is the effective porosity c is the concentration of contaminant in groundwater t is the time d ij is the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient tensor s component v i is the actual average velocity of water c s is the concentration of contaminant in the source or sink term and d is the aquifer thickness note that eq 2 is connected to eq 1 by darcy s law 3 v i k ij θ h x j i j 1 2 where k ij is the hydraulic conductivity tensor s component in this study modflow mcdonald and harbaugh 1988 and mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 were used to simulate groundwater flow and solute transport processes 2 2 the kriging surrogate model the kriging method is an interpolation method for predicting unknown observation points from known points it takes full advantage of changes in covariance to express changes in space and minimizes the error of the obtained predicted values the kriging model consists of the polynomial and random distributions zeng et al 2016 its basic form is as follows chang et al 2021 wang et al 2020 4 y x f t x β z x i 1 s f i x β i z x where x is the input y x is the output f x f 1 x f 2 x f s x t is the basis function of the known regression function its selection methods include constant first function quadratic function types etc β β 1 β 2 β s t is the coefficient of the corresponding basis function and z x is a random item satisfying the following conditions 5 e z x 0 d z x σ 2 c o v z x i z x j σ 2 r x i x j where e is the operator representing the expectation d is the operator representing the variance σ 2 is the variance and r x i x j is the correlation function between two sampling points which is usually selected in the gaussian model 6 r x i x j exp k 1 n θ k x i k x j k 2 where n is the dimension of the sampling point θ k are the undetermined coefficients and x i k is the k th dimension of the i th sampling point according to the kriging model for any point x the predicted response y x is as follows zeng et al 2016 7 y x f t x β r t x r 1 y fβ where y y 1 y 2 y m t is the response value corresponding to the sampling points of training samples x 1 x 2 x m m is the number of sampling points of training samples r t x is the correlation vector between point x and the training points r t x r x x 1 r x x 2 r x x m r is the correlation matrix of m sampling points 8 r r x 1 x 1 r x 1 x m r x m x 1 r x m x m f is the design matrix β is evaluated by the best linear unbiased estimation 9 f f 1 x 1 f s x 1 f 1 x m f s x m 10 β f t r 1 f 1 f t r 1 y θ k can be identified by solving the following optimization problem 11 mle max θ k 0 1 2 m ln σ 2 ln r where σ 2 1 m y fβ t r 1 y fβ r is the determinant of r after obtaining the undetermined coefficients θ k the kriging surrogate model can be established 2 3 the ensemble kalman filter the enkf is based on a monte carlo sampling strategy to generate a parameter ensemble to approximate the probability distribution of parameters unlike the traditional kf algorithm it does not need to calculate the covariance of the current time according to the covariance of the previous time instead it uses the realizations in the ensemble to calculate the covariance and uses the sample covariance to approximate the population covariance xu et al 2021 the basic principles of enkf are as follows 1 at the initial time n parameter vectors are randomly generated according to the prior distribution of parameters to form the parameter ensemble at the initial time the specific manifestation is as follows 12 y 0 x 0 1 x 0 n where x 0 k is the parameter vector the superscript k 1 n denotes the sequence number of the parameter vector in the ensemble and the subscript denotes the time 2 forecast according to the prediction equation use the updated posterior parameter ensemble y g 1 x g 1 1 x g 1 n at the g 1 th time to predict the prior parameter ensemble y g x g 1 x g n at the g th time 13 x g k ψ x g 1 k where ψ is the prediction function 3 update by using the observed values obtained at the g th time the prior parameter ensemble obtained at the g th time is modified and updated to obtain the posterior parameter ensemble at the g th time 14 x g k x g k k g z g e g k h g x g k 15 k g d yf d ff r g 1 where x g k x g k are the prior and posterior before and after the update parameter vectors at the g th time k g is the kalman gain matrix z g is the vector of all the observed values at the g th time e g k is the vector of random observation errors h g x g k k 1 n is the vector representing the outputs of the original model at the g th time when the given parameter is x g k d yf is the cross covariance matrix of y g and f g h g x g 1 h g x g n d ff is the self covariance matrix of f g and r g is the covariance matrix of the observation errors 4 processes 2 and 3 are repeated until the last time to obtain the final posterior parameter ensemble and the posterior estimation of parameters 2 4 the adaptive step length ant colony optimization as a random search algorithm the aco simulates the foraging behavior of ants in nature ants release pheromones when they are looking for food the shorter the path from nest to food the more likely the ants pass through and release more pheromones the more pheromones the ants release the more attractive the path is and more ants choose it forming a positive feedback mechanism ant individuals exchange information through pheromones cooperate and finally find the optimal path socha and dorigo 2008 however the aco algorithm usually seeks the maximum value when solving the continuous space optimization problems but we often seek the minimum value in gcsi therefore we can transform it into the maximum value problem by the following formula 16 max f x min f x where f x is the objective function to be optimized the basic steps of the algorithm are as follows 1 initialization parameters including the number of ants na the maximum number of iterations i max and other parameters 2 set the initial position of each ant randomly the value range of each variable x x 1 x n is a b a 1 b 1 a n b n and the initial position of the i th ant is x i x i 1 x i n 17 x i j a j b j a j r a n d where rand is the random number rand 0 1 the initial value of the pheromone corresponding to the position of the i th ant is 18 t 0 i f x i 3 global search after all ants have completed a search in last round find the ant that releases the most pheromones the optimal ant x best other ants will turn to the optimal ant x best with a certain probability in this round of search to get new try points the transition probability and the updating formula of the corresponding try points are as follows 19 p i b e s t t b e s t t i t b e s t i b e s t 0 else 20 l i k x i k 1 λ x b e s t k 1 x i k 1 p i b e s t p 0 x i k 1 r a n d s step else where l i k is the new try point generated by the i th ant in the k th iteration k is the current iteration number λ 1 k p 0 is the transition probability constant rands is the random number rands 1 1 and step ste p 1 s t e p n is the search step length ste p j b j a j 2 4 local search the optimal ant in last round of search will continue to search locally in the neighborhood to get a new try point the updating formula of the try point is as follows 21 l i k x b e s t k 1 λ r a n d s step 5 the objective function values of the new try points are compared with those of the previous points in global search and local search if the objective function values of the new try points are larger update the previous position of ants otherwise retain the previous position of ants the formula is as follows 22 x i k l i k f l i k f x i k 1 x i k 1 else 6 update pheromone after the ants complete the global search and local search the pheromones are updated 23 t i 1 ρ t i q f x i where ρ is the pheromone volatility coefficient and q is the total amount of pheromones released by the ant in one cycle usually set as a constant 7 determine whether to terminate when the maximum number of iterations is reached the calculation is terminated and the optimal solution is output otherwise return to process 3 to continue the search the adaptive step length search strategy was used to improve the search step length in processes 3 and 4 of the above aco algorithm in this study and the asaco algorithm was obtained this further enhanced the search efficiency of the previous aco algorithm making it difficult to fall into a local optimum the search step length in the early stage was larger and the search range was wider the search step length in the later stage was smaller and the search was more refined the step length changed adaptively to speed up the convergence and improve the algorithm s performance the specific formula is as follows 24 ste p k j b j a j 2 k k 0 3var k 1 j else where ste p k j is the step length of the j th variable in the k th iteration in the early stage the search step length is set to half of the distribution interval in the later iteration stage the step length is calculated according to the variance k 0 is the dividing point between the early stage and the later stage of iteration and var k 1 j is the variance of the j th variable in the k 1 th iteration which is calculated according to the ant samples in last iteration 3 case study 3 1 site overview in this study a hypothetical case was used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed enkf asaco algorithm the study area was a two dimensional heterogeneous isotropic confined aquifer with an irregular shape the plan is shown in fig 1 and there were three subdivisions the northwest and southeast boundaries of the study area ad bc were regarded as specified head boundaries the northeast and southwest boundaries ab cd were considered as no flow boundaries thus the direction of groundwater flow was from northwest to southeast there were one pollution source and five observation wells in the study area the whole simulation period was five years divided into four stress periods per year the contaminant concentrations at the five observation wells were gathered at the end moment of each stress period the pollution source only released the pollutant in the first three stress periods tables 1 and 2 show the relevant information of aquifer parameters and pollution source characteristics in this study a total of nine variables were taken as the variables to be solved for inversion including pollution source location horizontal coordinate x and longitudinal coordinate y pollution source release intensity in three stress periods sp 1 sp 2 sp 3 hydraulic conductivity of three zones k 1 k 2 k 3 and longitudinal dispersity of the whole region α l the pollution source characteristics and simulation model parameters were identified simultaneously the actual values and prior distribution are shown in table 3 and the observation data of five wells are shown in fig 2 the migration of the pollution plume on days 180 360 540 810 1080 and 1440 are shown in fig 3 3 2 establishment of the kriging surrogate model this paper adopted the kriging method to build a surrogate model of the simulation model reducing the huge computational load caused by repeatedly calling the numerical simulation model and maintaining a better approximation accuracy a total of nine variables to be solved were taken as input variables of the surrogate model including the pollution source location horizontal coordinate x and longitudinal coordinate y the pollution source release intensity in three stress periods sp 1 sp 2 sp 3 the hydraulic conductivity of three zones k 1 k 2 k 3 and the longitudinal dispersity of the whole region α l in addition the corresponding concentration of each observation well at the end moment of each stress period was taken as the output variable the steps to build a kriging surrogate model are as follows firstly according to the prior distribution of each input variable as shown in table 3 the latin hypercube sampling method was used to generate the input variables of 500 groups of training samples and 45 groups of test samples the corresponding concentrations outputs were obtained by running the simulation model and 545 groups of input output samples were obtained in total secondly 500 input output training samples were used to identify the parameters of the kriging surrogate model this paper used the dace a matlab kriging toolbox developed by lophaven et al 2002 to execute the kriging method the parameters to be identified in the kriging surrogate model were θ k k 1 2 n eq 6 in the correlation function these parameters are key to establishing the kriging surrogate model where n is the dimension of input variables in this study it was set to 9 the values of θ k k 1 2 9 were identified by the optimization algorithm in the dace toolbox the results are shown in fig 4 finally 45 input output test samples were used to test the accuracy of the surrogate model in this paper two indexes were used to evaluate the accuracy of the kriging surrogate model established including the coefficient of determination r 2 and the mean relative error mre 1 coefficient of determination r 2 25 r 2 1 i 1 m j 1 u y i j y i j 2 i 1 m j 1 u y i j y 2 where m is the number of samples u is the dimension of the output vector of the simulation model surrogate model y i j is the j th element in the i th output vector of the simulation model y i j is the j th element in the i th output vector of the surrogate model and y is the average value of the simulation model output the closer r 2 gets to 1 the higher the accuracy of the surrogate model is 2 mre 26 mre i 1 m j 1 u y i j y i j y i j u m 3 3 establishment of the optimization model after the surrogate model of the simulation model was established the optimization model was set up the optimization model consists of decision variables objective function and constraint conditions in this study the nine variables to be solved for inversion were taken as decision variables including the location of the pollution source horizontal coordinate x and longitudinal coordinate y the release intensity of the pollution source in three stress periods sp 1 sp 2 sp 3 the hydraulic conductivity of three zones k 1 k 2 k 3 and the longitudinal dispersity of the whole region α l in addition the minimum square sum of the difference between the actual observed concentration and the calculated output concentration of the observation wells was taken as the objective function finally the surrogate model was embedded into the optimization model as an equality constraint condition and the upper and lower constraints of each decision variable were considered to establish the optimization model as follows min z x y s p 1 s p 2 s p 3 k 1 k 2 k 3 α l t t 1 t 20 k 1 5 c k t c k t 2 27 s t 480 x 760 1440 y 1680 10 s p 1 40 10 s p 2 40 10 s p 3 40 20 k 1 50 20 k 2 50 20 k 3 50 20 α l 50 c k t f x y s p 1 s p 2 s p 3 k 1 k 2 k 3 α l where c k t is the calculated output concentration of the k th observation well at time t c k t is the actual observed concentration of the k th observation well at time t and c k t f x y s p 1 s p 2 s p 3 k 1 k 2 k 3 α l is an equality constraint made up of the surrogate model 3 4 implementation of the enkf asaco algorithm in this study the enkf and asaco algorithms were combined to construct an enkf asaco algorithm this was used to identify nine variables to be solved simultaneously firstly the enkf algorithm ensemble capacity is 1000 was used for identification and the final parameter ensemble was obtained this final ensemble consisted of 1000 parameter vectors and each vector represented a realization of the nine variables to be solved in this inversion the final identification results of the enkf algorithm were the mean values of the 1000 parameter vectors in this ensemble then this set of results was used to replace the initial position of the ant having the least pheromones in the asaco algorithm providing a better initial position for it on this basis the asaco algorithm was used to solve the optimization model some parameter settings in the asaco algorithm are shown in table 4 the specific flow chart of the enkf asaco algorithm is shown in fig 5 in addition to further verify the effectiveness of the enkf asaco algorithm the previous aco algorithm and the asaco algorithm were also used to identify the pollution source characteristics and simulation model parameters the identification results of the enkf aco asaco and enkf asaco algorithms were compared however in the actual gcsi the observed concentrations may have measurement errors that generally occur in field measurements or laboratory tests singh and datta 2006 therefore to test the reliability and robustness of the proposed algorithm in the real scenario the observed concentrations calculated by the simulation model were perturbed by the normally distributed errors which simulated the measurement errors in the real scenario hayford and datta 2021 the perturbed concentrations were computed as follows 28 c p e r t c ε a c where c p e r t are the perturbed observed concentrations c are the observed concentrations without perturbation ε is a normally distributed error term with a zero mean and standard deviation of one and a is the noise intensity this study assumed the noise intensity was equal to 0 1 after the perturbed observed concentrations were obtained they were used in gcsi then the enkf asaco algorithm was used to identify the pollution source characteristics and simulation model parameters and the identification results of the enkf asaco algorithm in the scenarios with and without measurement errors were compared and analyzed 4 results and discussion 4 1 analysis of the surrogate model forty five input output test samples were used to test the approximation accuracy of the kriging surrogate model to the simulation model the output concentration comparison of the two models is shown in fig 6 the oblique line on fig 6 represents y x the more concentrated the scattered points are near y x indicating that the surrogate model has a better fitting effect on the simulation model and higher precision it can be roughly seen from fig 6 that the scattered points are relatively concentrated on y x and the fitting situation is good to further evaluate the accuracy of the surrogate model the coefficient of determination r 2 and the mre were used the results showed that the r 2 was 0 9804 and the mre was 4 28 the closer r 2 is to 1 the smaller the mre and the higher the surrogate model s accuracy therefore the kriging surrogate model established in this study has a high approximation accuracy to the simulation model and can replace the simulation model for subsequent calculations when the enkf algorithm was used for identification a total of 20 000 calls the product of the number of stress periods and the ensemble capacity of enkf to the simulation model were needed taking about 167 h to complete on the 3 4 ghz dual core i3 cpu and 8 gb ram pc platform it was very time consuming in this study the kriging surrogate model was embedded into the enkf algorithm as a result it only took about 4 6 h to establish and call the kriging surrogate model the time to establish the surrogate model was about 4 58 h significantly reducing the calculation time moreover when solving the optimization model of the enkf asaco algorithm in a single time it took about 511 802 times n out i max n iter where n out is the number of the model to be called for initialization of ant position and result analysis i max is the maximum number of iterations n iter is the number of the model to be called in a single iteration in this case they are 102 1700 and 301 respectively to call the simulation model on the above pc platform it will take about 4 265 h to complete the call while it only took about 4 7 h to build and call the kriging surrogate model the time to establish the surrogate model was about 4 58 h which saved computing load therefore the kriging surrogate model established in this paper can significantly reduce the large calculation load caused by repeated calling to the simulation model 4 2 analysis of pollution source identification results table 6 shows the identification results of the enkf and enkf asaco algorithms to further compare the effects of the two algorithms fig 8 shows the comparison of the identification accuracy between the enkf and enkf asaco algorithms the relative error was used for evaluation in fig 8 the yellow red column represents the relative error between the identification result of the enkf enkf asaco algorithm and the actual value of each variable to be solved the higher the column is the larger the relative error and the worse the identification accuracy as seen in fig 8 when compared with the enkf algorithm the enkf asaco algorithm generally improved the identification accuracy of variables to be solved the maximum relative error of the identification results of the enkf algorithm was 21 24 while that of the enkf asaco algorithm was only 12 04 further calculation showed that the mre of the enkf algorithm was 7 96 while the mre of the enkf asaco algorithm was only 3 6 although the enkf algorithm can be used as a method to solve the gcsi problems alone its identification accuracy still needs improvement therefore the enkf and asaco algorithms were combined in this study to obtain the enkf asaco algorithm the results show that compared with the single enkf algorithm the enkf asaco algorithm can significantly improve the overall identification accuracy which is reasonable and feasible the identification accuracy of the enkf asaco algorithm was significantly improved compared to that of the enkf algorithm alone however to further verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm the previous aco asaco and enkf asaco algorithms were compared and analyzed in this study on the identification results fig 7 shows the convergence curves of the three algorithms the blue line green or red line in fig 7 represents the convergence curve of the aco asaco or enkf asaco algorithm when the objective function value tends to be stable it can be considered to be roughly convergent as seen in fig 7 all the three algorithms tended to be stable and converged in 1700 iterations however as can be seen from the inflection points in fig 7 the aco algorithm tended to be stable after about the 290th iteration and the asaco algorithm tended to be stable after about the 160th iteration therefore it can be seen that the asaco algorithm speeds up the convergence to some extent compared with the previous aco algorithm in contrast the enkf asaco algorithm tended to be stable after about the 80th iteration the number of iterations when it tended to be stable was smaller than the aco and asaco algorithms however the enkf asaco algorithm first needed to use the enkf algorithm to select the initial point for the asaco algorithm the 20 000 calls enkf needed to initialize the procedure in enkf asaco were taken into account to compare the convergence speed of different algorithms more reasonably when the three algorithms aco asaco and enkf asaco converged the total number of required forward model calls and the total time of model calls including simulation model and surrogate model were shown in table 5 as seen in table 5 the total number of model calls and the total time spent by the enkf asaco algorithm were still the least therefore compared with the previous aco algorithm and the asaco algorithm the enkf asaco algorithm proposed in this study can accelerate the convergence and improve search efficiency in addition as the aco algorithm is a maximum seeking problem the larger the objective function value is the closer the optimal solution is to the actual value at the inflection points it can be seen that the objective function values found by the previous aco algorithm and the asaco algorithm were about 610 and 360 compared with the previous aco algorithm the objective function value found by the asaco algorithm was larger and closer to the actual value therefore the asaco algorithm had a stronger optimization ability than the previous aco algorithm in contrast the objective function value found by the enkf asaco algorithm was about 120 which was better than the objective function values of the aco and asaco algorithms the results show that among the three algorithms the solution found by the enkf asaco algorithm is the closest to the actual value and the proposed algorithm can avoid falling into a local optimum to some extent to further verify the effectiveness of the enkf asaco algorithm proposed in this paper the identification results of pollution source characteristics and simulation model parameters by the previous aco asaco and enkf asaco algorithms were compared with the actual values as shown in table 6 it can be roughly seen from table 6 that the identification results using the enkf asaco algorithm were better than those using the previous aco algorithm and the asaco algorithm alone and were closer to the actual values to intuitively compare the identification accuracy of the three algorithms the relative error was used for evaluation the evaluation results are shown in fig 8 in fig 8 the blue green or red column represents the relative error between the identification result of the aco asaco or enkf asaco algorithm and the actual value of each variable to be solved the higher the column is the larger the relative error and the worse the identification accuracy as shown in fig 8 the relative error of the identification results of each variable to be solved by the enkf asaco algorithm was minimal the maximum relative error of the aco algorithm identification results was 28 72 the maximum relative error of the asaco algorithm identification results was 14 8 while the maximum relative error of the enkf asaco algorithm was only 12 04 further calculation showed that the mre of the aco algorithm identification results was 10 99 and it was reduced to 6 55 after using the asaco algorithm in contrast after using the enkf asaco algorithm the mre was directly reduced to 3 6 thus the previous aco algorithm had the worst identification accuracy the asaco algorithm was better than the aco algorithm generally and the enkf asaco algorithm had the highest identification accuracy compared with the previous aco algorithm and the asaco algorithm the enkf asaco algorithm proposed in this study can effectively reduce the overall error level of the identification results and improve the identification accuracy in particular the pollution source release intensity s identification accuracy was significantly higher than that of the previous aco algorithm therefore it can be seen from the above comparison and analysis that the asaco algorithm greatly improved both the convergence speed and identification accuracy compared with the previous aco algorithm it was proved that the adaptive step length search strategy adopted in this study was effective in improving the previous aco algorithm in addition the enkf asaco algorithm obtained by using enkf to provide an initial point improved the search efficiency and identification accuracy compared with the asaco algorithm it was proved that this improvement of providing a good initial point with enkf for the optimization algorithm in this study was also valid therefore the two improvements proposed in this paper were effective for the optimization algorithm no matter which one was used alone there is no doubt that compared with the previous aco algorithm that has no improvement the enkf asaco algorithm proposed in this paper by combining the two improvements has the most obvious effect this is superior to any single improvement based on the above comparison and analysis on the one hand compared with the single enkf algorithm the enkf asaco algorithm can improve the overall identification accuracy on the other hand compared with the single optimization algorithms aco and asaco the enkf asaco algorithm can accelerate the convergence speed and improve search efficiency moreover the proposed algorithm can avoid falling into the local optimum to some extent and improve the identification accuracy therefore the new algorithm proposed in this paper is superior to the three single algorithms which is very effective and feasible to further verify the reliability and robustness of the proposed algorithm in the real scenario the observed concentrations calculated by the simulation model were perturbed by the normally distributed errors that simulated the measurement errors fig 9 shows the comparison between the actual values and the identification results of the enkf asaco algorithm in the scenarios of observed concentrations with and without measurement errors the horizontal coordinate represents nine variables to be solved the first two variables to be solved the location of the pollution source refer to the scale values of the left vertical axis and the last seven variables to be solved refer to the scale values of the right vertical axis for each of these variables the first bar represents the actual value the second represents the identification value of the enkf asaco algorithm based on observed concentrations without errors and the third bar represents the identification value based on observed concentrations with measurement errors the noise intensity was equal to 0 1 as seen in fig 9 compared with the enkf asaco algorithm in the scenario with measurement errors the identification results of the enkf asaco algorithm in the scenario without measurement errors were more accurate and closer to the actual values it was calculated that the mre of the enkf asaco algorithm was 3 6 when there were no errors and the mre was 7 02 when there were errors although the accuracy was affected when we had the measurement errors the identification results of the enkf asaco algorithm still maintained a good accuracy its performance was satisfactory and encouraging therefore the enkf asaco algorithm proposed in this paper is still applicable and effective for a real scenario with measurement errors 4 3 discussion the surrogate model can approximate the input output response of the simulation model with a smaller computational load and ensure a better accuracy therefore the research of the surrogate model has fundamental theoretical and practical significance although in this study the kriging method was adopted to build a surrogate model in the future the deep learning method can be studied to build a surrogate model to improve the accuracy further however no matter what method is used to construct the surrogate model of the simulation model there are often some errors between the surrogate model and the simulation model which may have a slight impact on the subsequent identification results this study did not take this as the research focus and further exploration and research on related aspects can be carried out in the future in solving the gcsi problems the so method has been most widely used but the optimization algorithms in the so method often rely on the selection of an initial point if the initial point is far from the actual value the convergence speed of the algorithm will be slow and it will easily fall into the local optimum so it is difficult to obtain the accurate identification results of the pollution source some researchers embedded the homotopy algorithm into the optimization algorithm to solve the problem hou et al 2021 li et al 2021 however the homotopy algorithm will greatly increase the time cost in recent years the enkf algorithm as a kf method has been widely used in gcsi due to its advantages of simple invocation and fast running speed its limitation is that when the inverse problem has a strong nonlinearity its identification accuracy needs improvement inspired by previous studies and thinking this study combined two different methods the kf and so methods to alleviate the problem that the optimization algorithm easily falls into the local optimum and complement the optimization ability of the enkf algorithm to some extent in future gcsi studies researchers are encouraged to combine different methods give full attention to the advantages of each method and learn from each other to overcome the limitations of a single method this will provide a more accurate basis for the design of groundwater pollution remediation schemes and risk assessment in real scenarios measurement errors often exist in observed data the enkf asaco algorithm proposed in this paper had been tested by considering measurement errors and its performance was satisfactory and encouraging it shows that this algorithm is effective and robust even in the scenario with errors however gcsi is dependent on observed data and measurement errors in the observed data may directly affect the accuracy of identification results therefore the enkf asaco algorithm constructed in this paper had a lower identification accuracy in the scenario with errors than in the scenario without errors denoising will be effective before using the observed data in real scenarios but this is beyond the scope of this study relevant research will be carried out in the future 5 conclusions this study constructed an enkf asaco algorithm which was used to identify pollution source characteristics and simulation model parameters simultaneously firstly the enkf algorithm was used for identification and the identification results were regarded as the initial point of the optimization algorithm on this basis the adaptive step length search strategy was used to improve the aco algorithm and the asaco algorithm was obtained as a result it made the step length change adaptively at the same time to reduce the huge computational load caused by repeatedly calling the numerical simulation model the kriging method was used to establish a surrogate model of the simulation model finally the identification results of the enkf previous aco asaco and enkf asaco algorithms were compared and analyzed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed new algorithm additionally the enkf asaco algorithm was also applied to a scenario with measurement errors to further test the robustness and reliability in the real scenario the conclusions are as follows 1 in gcsi the kriging method was used to build the surrogate model of the simulation model which can significantly reduce the huge calculation load caused by repeatedly calling to the simulation model improving the inversion efficiency and ensuring a high approximation accuracy 2 in this paper the enkf asaco algorithm was used to simultaneously identify unknown pollution source characteristics and simulation model parameters including pollution source location horizontal coordinate and longitudinal coordinate pollution source release intensity in three stress periods hydraulic conductivity of three zones and longitudinal dispersity of the whole region the identification results were compared and analyzed with those of the enkf previous aco and asaco algorithms the results show that compared with the three single algorithms the enkf asaco algorithm proposed in this paper can speed up the convergence and improve the search efficiency moreover the proposed algorithm can avoid falling into local optimum to some extent and improve the identification accuracy which is very effective and feasible 3 in real scenarios measurement errors often exist in observed data the enkf asaco algorithm was also applied to a scenario with measurement errors the results show that the enkf asaco algorithm can still maintain a good identification accuracy and the robustness and reliability are further verified declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

3755,the simulation optimization so method is the most widely used method for groundwater contaminant source identification however the heuristic optimization algorithms in the so method often rely on the selection of the initial point the initial estimate of each variable to be solved if the initial point is far from the actual value the convergence speed of the algorithm will be slow and it will easily converge prematurely it is challenging to obtain the accurate identification results of the contaminant source therefore providing a good initial point for the optimization algorithm is critical the ensemble kalman filter enkf algorithm has the advantages of a simple calculation process and fast running speed however when the inverse problem has a strong nonlinearity its identification accuracy still needs improvement this study combined the enkf and adaptive step length ant colony optimization asaco algorithms to construct an enkf asaco algorithm this was used to identify pollution source characteristics and simulation model parameters simultaneously first the enkf algorithm was adopted to provide a good initial point for the optimization algorithm on this basis the adaptive step length search strategy was used to improve the ant colony optimization aco algorithm and the asaco algorithm was obtained as a result the step length changed adaptively to avoid falling into the local optimum at the same time to reduce the substantial computational load caused by repeatedly calling the numerical simulation model the kriging method was used to establish a surrogate model of the simulation model finally the identification results of the enkf asaco algorithm were compared and analyzed with those of the enkf previous aco and asaco algorithms to verify the effectiveness of the proposed new algorithm the results show that compared with the three single algorithms the enkf asaco algorithm constructed in this study can speed up the convergence speed and significantly improve the search efficiency and identification accuracy additionally the enkf asaco algorithm was also applied in the scenario with measurement errors and its robustness and reliability were further verified keywords adaptive step length ant colony optimization ensemble kalman filter groundwater contaminant simultaneous identification surrogate model 1 introduction groundwater contaminant is characterized by the concealment of existence and lag of discovery this brings great difficulties to designing groundwater pollution remediation schemes risk assessment and responsibility determination li et al 2021 therefore the research on groundwater contaminant source identification gcsi is fundamental gcsi is based on the actual dynamic monitoring data water level and concentration and other auxiliary information such as field investigations and professional knowledge to inverse the mathematical simulation model describing groundwater contamination thus the aquifer s relevant information of groundwater contaminant sources can be identified including the number spatial location and release history there are many theories and methods to solve the problems of gcsi including the simulation optimization so method simulation random statistics srs method and kalman filter kf method etc in the so method the simulation model is embedded into the optimization model as an equality constraint condition the deviation between the output results of the simulation model and the actual observed data is taken as the objective function and the optimization algorithm is used to solve the optimization model continuously finally the optimal solution can be found to minimize the objective function value xing et al 2019 among them the optimization algorithms are the key which can be divided into the non heuristic optimization algorithms and heuristic optimization algorithms at present the heuristic algorithms are widely used in gcsi such as the genetic algorithm aral et al 2001 mahinthakumar and sayeed 2005 singh and datta 2006 simulated annealing algorithm jha and datta 2013 yeh et al 2007 and particle swarm optimization algorithm guneshwor et al 2018 zhao et al 2020 among others the so method has a strong optimization ability but it cannot consider the uncertainty of solutions zhang et al 2015 moreover the heuristic optimization algorithms usually rely on initial point selection and will easily fall into the local optimum in the srs method the objective is to maximize the posterior probability of unknown variables under given observed data xu et al 2021 some approaches adopted for this objective are minimum relative entropy cupola et al 2015a woodbury and ulrych 1996 the geostatistical approach butera et al 2013 cupola et al 2015b michalak and kitanidis 2004 or bayesian approaches pirot et al 2019 zanini and woodbury 2016 the srs method can evaluate the uncertainty of unknown variables still this method usually requires a large computational load especially when dealing with a high dimensional problem and the search efficiency may become low in the kf method the covariance is used to describe the relationship between states or parameters and states the covariance and observed data are used to update states or parameters the kf method is based on linear estimation theory and has the advantage of small computation it was originally used to solve linear problems kalman 1960 later it was developed and improved to solve nonlinear problems evensen 1994 papanastassiou 1992 however when the kf method deals with a strong nonlinear problem its identification accuracy still needs improvement each method has its advantages and limitations the so method is the most widely used method in the above three methods to solve the gcsi problems ayvaz 2010 mirghani et al 2009 the ant colony optimization aco algorithm is a new bionic optimization algorithm to simulate the foraging behavior of ants li et al 2010 this algorithm was used to solve the combinatorial optimization problems previously dorigo 1992 later research development has been gradually improved and applied to solve continuous optimization problems bilchev and parmee 1995 socha and dorigo 2008 it has been widely used in many fields but few people have applied it to the gcsi in this study it has been applied to the identification of the groundwater contaminant source however heuristic algorithms such as the aco algorithm still rely on initial point selection initial estimate of each variable to be solved if the initial point is far from the actual value the convergence speed of the algorithm will be slow and it easily converges prematurely it is difficult to obtain accurate identification results of the contaminant source some researchers embedded the homotopy algorithm into the optimization algorithm to solve this problem hou et al 2021 li et al 2021 however the homotopy algorithm will significantly increase the time cost evensen 1994 proposed the ensemble kalman filter enkf which is a kind of kf method by generating a parameter ensemble based on a monte carlo sampling strategy to approximate the probability distribution of parameters sun et al 2020 enkf and some of its variants have been widely used in gcsi in recent years ju et al 2018 li et al 2012 todaro et al 2021 xu and gomez hernandez 2016 xu and gomez hernandez 2018 the enkf algorithm has the advantages of a simple calculation process and fast running speed moreover it can consider the uncertainty of parameters since the final outcome is always the form of ensemble chen et al 2018 wang et al 2019 however when the inverse problem has a strong nonlinearity its identification accuracy still needs improvement therefore the combination of the enkf and optimization algorithms is considered to further learn from each other the enkf algorithm was adopted to select the initial point and provide a better initial point for the optimization algorithm on the one hand the optimization algorithm can make up for the optimization ability of the enkf algorithm on the other hand the enkf algorithm can speed up the convergence of the optimization algorithm and avoid falling into the local optimum therefore combining the two algorithms in this way can improve the overall search efficiency although it is essential to provide a good initial point for the optimization algorithm to improve the aco algorithm s search efficiency further this study used the adaptive step length search strategy and obtained an adaptive step length ant colony optimization asaco algorithm the search step length in the early stage was larger and the search range was wider the search step length in the later stage was smaller and the search was more refined furthermore the step length changed adaptively to speed up the convergence and to make it difficult to fall into a local optimum the enkf and optimization algorithms need to repeatedly call the simulation model in the subsequent applications generating a huge computational load hou et al 2016 therefore this is a very effective way to solve this problem by establishing a surrogate model of the simulation model li et al 2020 the surrogate model can approximate the input output relationship of the simulation model with a small calculation load and maintain a high accuracy asher et al 2015 the kriging surrogate model has been widely used due to its flexibility and efficiency kleijnen 2017 but in the past research few people have combined it with the enkf in this study the kriging surrogate model was used in combination with the enkf and asaco algorithms to improve the efficiency of contaminant source identification this study constructed an enkf asaco algorithm which was used to identify the characteristics of the pollution source and simulation model parameters simultaneously firstly the enkf algorithm was adopted for identification and the identification results were regarded as the initial point of the optimization algorithm on this basis the adaptive step length search strategy was used to improve the aco algorithm and the asaco algorithm was obtained the step length changed adaptively to speed up the convergence and avoid falling into the local optimum at the same time to reduce the huge computational load caused by repeatedly calling the numerical simulation model the kriging method was used to establish a surrogate model of the simulation model finally the identification results of the enkf asaco algorithm were compared with those of the enkf previous aco and asaco algorithms to verify the effectiveness of the proposed new algorithm additionally to further test its robustness and reliability in the real scenario the enkf asaco algorithm was also applied to a scenario where there were measurement errors in the observed data the rest of this article is organized as follows section 2 describes the necessary details of the methods used in this article section 3 describes the details of the hypothetical case and implementation steps then in section 4 the results of the algorithms are compared and discussed finally some conclusions are given in section 5 2 methodology 2 1 the simulation model the groundwater numerical simulation model includes the groundwater flow and solute transport models the latter is established based on the former the governing partial differential equation of two dimensional stabilized flow in a confined aquifer is expressed as follows singh and datta 2006 1 x i t ij h x j w i j 1 2 where x i x j are the cartesian coordinates t ij is the transmissivity tensor s component h is the hydraulic head and w is the volumetric flux per unit area the governing partial differential equation of the groundwater solute transport is singh and datta 2006 zhao et al 2016 2 θ c t x i θ d ij c x j x i θ c v i c s w d i j 1 2 where θ is the effective porosity c is the concentration of contaminant in groundwater t is the time d ij is the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient tensor s component v i is the actual average velocity of water c s is the concentration of contaminant in the source or sink term and d is the aquifer thickness note that eq 2 is connected to eq 1 by darcy s law 3 v i k ij θ h x j i j 1 2 where k ij is the hydraulic conductivity tensor s component in this study modflow mcdonald and harbaugh 1988 and mt3dms zheng and wang 1999 were used to simulate groundwater flow and solute transport processes 2 2 the kriging surrogate model the kriging method is an interpolation method for predicting unknown observation points from known points it takes full advantage of changes in covariance to express changes in space and minimizes the error of the obtained predicted values the kriging model consists of the polynomial and random distributions zeng et al 2016 its basic form is as follows chang et al 2021 wang et al 2020 4 y x f t x β z x i 1 s f i x β i z x where x is the input y x is the output f x f 1 x f 2 x f s x t is the basis function of the known regression function its selection methods include constant first function quadratic function types etc β β 1 β 2 β s t is the coefficient of the corresponding basis function and z x is a random item satisfying the following conditions 5 e z x 0 d z x σ 2 c o v z x i z x j σ 2 r x i x j where e is the operator representing the expectation d is the operator representing the variance σ 2 is the variance and r x i x j is the correlation function between two sampling points which is usually selected in the gaussian model 6 r x i x j exp k 1 n θ k x i k x j k 2 where n is the dimension of the sampling point θ k are the undetermined coefficients and x i k is the k th dimension of the i th sampling point according to the kriging model for any point x the predicted response y x is as follows zeng et al 2016 7 y x f t x β r t x r 1 y fβ where y y 1 y 2 y m t is the response value corresponding to the sampling points of training samples x 1 x 2 x m m is the number of sampling points of training samples r t x is the correlation vector between point x and the training points r t x r x x 1 r x x 2 r x x m r is the correlation matrix of m sampling points 8 r r x 1 x 1 r x 1 x m r x m x 1 r x m x m f is the design matrix β is evaluated by the best linear unbiased estimation 9 f f 1 x 1 f s x 1 f 1 x

after obtaining the undetermined coefficients θ k the kriging surrogate model can be established 2 3 the ensemble kalman filter the enkf is based on a monte carlo sampling strategy to generate a parameter ensemble to approximate the probability distribution of parameters unlike the traditional kf algorithm it does not need to calculate the covariance of the current time according to the covariance of the previous time instead it uses the realizations in the ensemble to calculate the covariance and uses the sample covariance to approximate the population covariance xu et al 2021 the basic principles of enkf are as follows 1 at the initial time n parameter vectors are randomly generated according to the prior distribution of parameters to form the parameter ensemble at the initial time the specific manifestation is as follows 12 y 0 x 0 1 x 0 n where x 0 k is the parameter vector the superscript k 1 n denotes the sequence number of the parameter vector in the ensemble and the subscript denotes the time 2 forecast according to the prediction equation use the updated posterior parameter ensemble y g 1 x g 1 1 x g 1 n at the g 1 th time to predict the prior parameter ensemble y g x g 1 x g n at the g th time 13 x g k ψ x g 1 k where ψ is the prediction function 3 update by using the observed values obtained at the g th time the prior parameter ensemble obtained at the g th time is modified and updated to obtain the posterior parameter ensemble at the g th time 14 x g k x g k k g z g e g k h g x g k 15 k g d yf d ff r g 1 where x g k x g k are the prior and posterior before and after the update parameter vectors at the g th time k g is the kalman gain matrix z g is the vector of all the observed values at the g th time e g k is the vector of random observation errors h g x g k k 1 n is the vector representing the outputs of the original model at the g th time when the given parameter is x g k d yf is the cross covariance matrix of y g and f g h g x g 1 h g x g n d ff is the self covariance matrix of f g and r g is the covariance matrix of the observation errors 4 processes 2 and 3 are repeated until the last time to obtain the final posterior parameter ensemble and the posterior estimation of parameters 2 4 the adaptive step length ant colony optimization as a random search algorithm the aco simulates the foraging behavior of ants in nature ants release pheromones when they are looking for food the shorter the path from nest to food the more likely the ants pass through and release more pheromones the more pheromones the ants release the more attractive the path is and more ants choose it forming a positive feedback mechanism ant individuals exchange information through pheromones cooperate and finally find the optimal path socha and dorigo 2008 however the aco algorithm usually seeks the maximum value when solving the continuous space optimization problems but we often seek the minimum value in gcsi therefore we can transform it into the maximum value problem by the following formula 16 max f x min f x where f x is the objective function to be optimized the basic steps of the algorithm are as follows 1 initialization parameters including the number of ants na the maximum number of iterations i max and other parameters 2 set the initial position of each ant randomly the value range of each variable x x 1 x n is a b a 1 b 1 a n b n and the initial position of the i th ant is x i x i 1 x i n 17 x i j a j b j a j r a n d where rand is the random number rand 0 1 the initial value of the pheromone corresponding to the position of the i th ant is 18 t 0 i f x i 3 global search after all ants have completed a search in last round find the ant that releases the most pheromones the optimal ant x best other ants will turn to the optimal ant x best with a certain probability in this round of search to get new try points the transition probability and the updating formula of the corresponding try points are as follows 19 p i b e s t t b e s t t i t b e s t i b e s t 0 else 20 l i k x i k 1 λ x b e s t k 1 x i k 1 p i b e s t p 0 x i k 1 r a n d s step else where l i k is the new try point generated by the i th ant in the k th iteration k is the current iteration number λ 1 k p 0 is the transition probability constant rands is the random number rands 1 1 and step ste p 1 s t e p n is the search step length ste p j b j a j 2 4 local search the optimal ant in last round of search will continue to search locally in the neighborhood to get a new try point the updating formula of the try point is as follows 21 l i k x b e s t k 1 λ r a n d s step 5 the objective function values of the new try points are compared with those of the previous points in global search and local search if the objective function values of the new try points are larger update the previous position of ants otherwise retain the previous position of ants the formula is as follows 22 x i k l i k f l i k f x i k 1 x i k 1 else 6 update pheromone after the ants complete the global search and local search the pheromones are updated 23 t i 1 ρ t i q f x i where ρ is the pheromone volatility coefficient and q is the total amount of pheromones released by the ant in one cycle usually set as a constant 7 determine whether to terminate when the maximum number of iterations is reached the calculation is terminated and the optimal solution is output otherwise return to process 3 to continue the search the adaptive step length search strategy was used to improve the search step length in processes 3 and 4 of the above aco algorithm in this study and the asaco algorithm was obtained this further enhanced the search efficiency of the previous aco algorithm making it difficult to fall into a local optimum the search step length in the early stage was larger and the search range was wider the search step length in the later stage was smaller and the search was more refined the step length changed adaptively to speed up the convergence and improve the algorithm s performance the specific formula is as follows 24 ste p k j b j a j 2 k k 0 3var k 1 j else where ste p k j is the step length of the j th variable in the k th iteration in the early stage the search step length is set to half of the distribution interval in the later iteration stage the step length is calculated according to the variance k 0 is the dividing point between the early stage and the later stage of iteration and var k 1 j is the variance of the j th variable in the k 1 th iteration which is calculated according to the ant samples in last iteration 3 case study 3 1 site overview in this study a hypothetical case was used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed enkf asaco algorithm the study area was a two dimensional heterogeneous isotropic confined aquifer with an irregular shape the plan is shown in fig 1 and there were three subdivisions the northwest and southeast boundaries of the study area ad bc were regarded as specified head boundaries the northeast and southwest boundaries ab cd were considered as no flow boundaries thus the direction of groundwater flow was from northwest to southeast there were one pollution source and five observation wells in the study area the whole simulation period was five years divided into four stress periods per year the contaminant concentrations at the five observation wells were gathered at the end moment of each stress period the pollution source only released the pollutant in the first three stress periods tables 1 and 2 show the relevant information of aquifer parameters and pollution source characteristics in this study a total of nine variables were taken as the variables to be solved for inversion including pollution source location horizontal coordinate x and longitudinal coordinate y pollution source release intensity in three stress periods sp 1 sp 2 sp 3 hydraulic conductivity of three zones k 1 k 2 k 3 and longitudinal dispersity of the whole region α l the pollution source characteristics and simulation model parameters were identified simultaneously the actual values and prior distribution are shown in table 3 and the observation data of five wells are shown in fig 2 the migration of the pollution plume on days 180 360 540 810 1080 and 1440 are shown in fig 3 3 2 establishment of the kriging surrogate model this paper adopted the kriging method to build a surrogate model of the simulation model reducing the huge computational load caused by repeatedly calling the numerical simulation model and maintaining a better approximation accuracy a total of nine variables to be solved were taken as input variables of the surrogate model including the pollution source location horizontal coordinate x and longitudinal coordinate y the pollution source release intensity in three stress periods sp 1 sp 2 sp 3 the hydraulic conductivity of three zones k 1 k 2 k 3 and the longitudinal dispersity of the whole region α l in addition the corresponding concentration of each observation well at the end moment of each stress period was taken as the output variable the steps to build a kriging surrogate model are as follows firstly according to the prior distribution of each input variable as shown in table 3 the latin hypercube sampling method was used to generate the input variables of 500 groups of training samples and 45 groups of test samples the corresponding concentrations outputs were obtained by running the simulation model and 545 groups of input output samples were obtained in total secondly 500 input output training samples were used to identify the parameters of the kriging surrogate model this paper used the dace a matlab kriging toolbox developed by lophaven et al 2002 to execute the kriging method the parameters to be identified in the kriging surrogate model were θ k k 1 2 n eq 6 in the correlation function these parameters are key to establishing the kriging surrogate model where n is the dimension of input variables in this study it was set to 9 the values of θ k k 1 2 9 were identified by the optimization algorithm in the dace toolbox the results are shown in fig 4 finally 45 input output test samples were used to test the accuracy of the surrogate model in this paper two indexes were used to evaluate the accuracy of the kriging surrogate model established including the coefficient of determination r 2 and the mean relative error mre 1 coefficient of determination r 2 25 r 2 1 i 1 m j 1 u y i j y i j 2 i 1 m j 1 u y i j y 2 where m is the number of samples u is the dimension of the output vector of the simulation model surrogate model y i j is the j th element in the i th output vector of the simulation model y i j is the j th element in the i th output vector of the surrogate model and y is the average value of the simulation model output the closer r 2 gets to 1 the higher the accuracy of the surrogate model is 2 mre 26 mre i 1 m j 1 u y i j y i j y i j u m 3 3 establishment of the optimization model after the surrogate model of the simulation model was established the optimization model was set up the optimization model consists of decision variables objective function and constraint conditions in this study the nine variables to be solved for inversion were taken as decision variables including the location of the pollution source horizontal coordinate x and longitudinal coordinate y the release intensity of the pollution source in three stress periods sp 1 sp 2 sp 3 the hydraulic conductivity of three zones k 1 k 2 k 3 and the longitudinal dispersity of the whole region α l in addition the minimum square sum of the difference between the actual observed concentration and the calculated output concentration of the observation wells was taken as the objective function finally the surrogate model was embedded into the optimization model as an equality constraint condition and the upper and lower constraints of each decision variable were considered to establish the optimization model as follows min z x y s p 1 s p 2 s p 3 k 1 k 2 k 3 α l t t 1 t 20 k 1 5 c k t c k t 2 27 s t 480 x 760 1440 y

observation well at time t c k t is the actual observed concentration of the k th observation well at time t and c k t f x y s p 1 s p 2 s p 3 k 1 k 2 k 3 α l is an equality constraint made up of the surrogate model 3 4 implementation of the enkf asaco algorithm in this study the enkf and asaco algorithms were combined to construct an enkf asaco algorithm this was used to identify nine variables to be solved simultaneously firstly the enkf algorithm ensemble capacity is 1000 was used for identification and the final parameter ensemble was obtained this final ensemble consisted of 1000 parameter vectors and each vector represented a realization of the nine variables to be solved in this inversion the final identification results of the enkf algorithm were the mean values of the 1000 parameter vectors in this ensemble then this set of results was used to replace the initial position of the ant having the least pheromones in the asaco algorithm providing a better initial position for it on this basis the asaco algorithm was used to solve the optimization model some parameter settings in the asaco algorithm are shown in table 4 the specific flow chart of the enkf asaco algorithm is shown in fig 5 in addition to further verify the effectiveness of the enkf asaco algorithm the previous aco algorithm and the asaco algorithm were also used to identify the pollution source characteristics and simulation model parameters the identification results of the enkf aco asaco and enkf asaco algorithms were compared however in the actual gcsi the observed concentrations may have measurement errors that generally occur in field measurements or laboratory tests singh and datta 2006 therefore to test the reliability and robustness of the proposed algorithm in the real scenario the observed concentrations calculated by the simulation model were perturbed by the normally distributed errors which simulated the measurement errors in the real scenario hayford and datta 2021 the perturbed concentrations were computed as follows 28 c p e r t c ε a c where c p e r t are the perturbed observed concentrations c are the observed concentrations without perturbation ε is a normally distributed error term with a zero mean and standard deviation of one and a is the noise intensity this study assumed the noise intensity was equal to 0 1 after the perturbed observed concentrations were obtained they were used in gcsi then the enkf asaco algorithm was used to identify the pollution source characteristics and simulation model parameters and the identification results of the enkf asaco algorithm in the scenarios with and without measurement errors were compared and analyzed 4 results and discussion 4 1 analysis of the surrogate model forty five input output test samples were used to test the approximation accuracy of the kriging surrogate model to the simulation model the output concentration comparison of the two models is shown in fig 6 the oblique line on fig 6 represents y x the more concentrated the scattered points are near y x indicating that the surrogate model has a better fitting effect on the simulation model and higher precision it can be roughly seen from fig 6 that the scattered points are relatively concentrated on y x and the fitting situation is good to further evaluate the accuracy of the surrogate model the coefficient of determination r 2 and the mre were used the results showed that the r 2 was 0 9804 and the mre was 4 28 the closer r 2 is to 1 the smaller the mre and the higher the surrogate model s accuracy therefore the kriging surrogate model established in this study has a high approximation accuracy to the simulation model and can replace the simulation model for subsequent calculations when the enkf algorithm was used for identification a total of 20 000 calls the product of the number of stress periods and the ensemble capacity of enkf to the simulation model were needed taking about 167 h to complete on the 3 4 ghz dual core i3 cpu and 8 gb ram pc platform it was very time consuming in this study the kriging surrogate model was embedded into the enkf algorithm as a result it only took about 4 6 h to establish and call the kriging surrogate model the time to establish the surrogate model was about 4 58 h significantly reducing the calculation time moreover when solving the optimization model of the enkf asaco algorithm in a single time it took about 511 802 times n out i max n iter where n out is the number of the model to be called for initialization of ant position and result analysis i max is the maximum number of iterations n iter is the number of the model to be called in a single iteration in this case they are 102 1700 and 301 respectively to call the simulation model on the above pc platform it will take about 4 265 h to complete the call while it only took about 4 7 h to build and call the kriging surrogate model the time to establish the surrogate model was about 4 58 h which saved computing load therefore the kriging surrogate model established in this paper can significantly reduce the large calculation load caused by repeated calling to the simulation model 4 2 analysis of pollution source identification results table 6 shows the identification results of the enkf and enkf asaco algorithms to further compare the effects of the two algorithms fig 8 shows the comparison of the identification accuracy between the enkf and enkf asaco algorithms the relative error was used for evaluation in fig 8 the yellow red column represents the relative error between the identification result of the enkf enkf asaco algorithm and the actual value of each variable to be solved the higher the column is the larger the relative error and the worse the identification accuracy as seen in fig 8 when compared with the enkf algorithm the enkf asaco algorithm generally improved the identification accuracy of variables to be solved the maximum relative error of the identification results of the enkf algorithm was 21 24 while that of the enkf asaco algorithm was only 12 04 further calculation showed that the mre of the enkf algorithm was 7 96 while the mre of the enkf asaco algorithm was only 3 6 although the enkf algorithm can be used as a method to solve the gcsi problems alone its identification accuracy still needs improvement therefore the enkf and asaco algorithms were combined in this study to obtain the enkf asaco algorithm the results show that compared with the single enkf algorithm the enkf asaco algorithm can significantly improve the overall identification accuracy which is reasonable and feasible the identification accuracy of the enkf asaco algorithm was significantly improved compared to that of the enkf algorithm alone however to further verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm the previous aco asaco and enkf asaco algorithms were compared and analyzed in this study on the identification results fig 7 shows the convergence curves of the three algorithms the blue line green or red line in fig 7 represents the convergence curve of the aco asaco or enkf asaco algorithm when the objective function value tends to be stable it can be considered to be roughly convergent as seen in fig 7 all the three algorithms tended to be stable and converged in 1700 iterations however as can be seen from the inflection points in fig 7 the aco algorithm tended to be stable after about the 290th iteration and the asaco algorithm tended to be stable after about the 160th iteration therefore it can be seen that the asaco algorithm speeds up the convergence to some extent compared with the previous aco algorithm in contrast the enkf asaco algorithm tended to be stable after about the 80th iteration the number of iterations when it tended to be stable was smaller than the aco and asaco algorithms however the enkf asaco algorithm first needed to use the enkf algorithm to select the initial point for the asaco algorithm the 20 000 calls enkf needed to initialize the procedure in enkf asaco were taken into account to compare the convergence speed of different algorithms more reasonably when the three algorithms aco asaco and enkf asaco converged the total number of required forward model calls and the total time of model calls including simulation model and surrogate model were shown in table 5 as seen in table 5 the total number of model calls and the total time spent by the enkf asaco algorithm were still the least therefore compared with the previous aco algorithm and the asaco algorithm the enkf asaco algorithm proposed in this study can accelerate the convergence and improve search efficiency in addition as the aco algorithm is a maximum seeking problem the larger the objective function value is the closer the optimal solution is to the actual value at the inflection points it can be seen that the objective function values found by the previous aco algorithm and the asaco algorithm were about 610 and 360 compared with the previous aco algorithm the objective function value found by the asaco algorithm was larger and closer to the actual value therefore the asaco algorithm had a stronger optimization ability than the previous aco algorithm in contrast the objective function value found by the enkf asaco algorithm was about 120 which was better than the objective function values of the aco and asaco algorithms the results show that among the three algorithms the solution found by the enkf asaco algorithm is the closest to the actual value and the proposed algorithm can avoid falling into a local optimum to some extent to further verify the effectiveness of the enkf asaco algorithm proposed in this paper the identification results of pollution source characteristics and simulation model parameters by the previous aco asaco and enkf asaco algorithms were compared with the actual values as shown in table 6 it can be roughly seen from table 6 that the identification results using the enkf asaco algorithm were better than those using the previous aco algorithm and the asaco algorithm alone and were closer to the actual values to intuitively compare the identification accuracy of the three algorithms the relative error was used for evaluation the evaluation results are shown in fig 8 in fig 8 the blue green or red column represents the relative error between the identification result of the aco asaco or enkf asaco algorithm and the actual value of each variable to be solved the higher the column is the larger the relative error and the worse the identification accuracy as shown in fig 8 the relative error of the identification results of each variable to be solved by the enkf asaco algorithm was minimal the maximum relative error of the aco algorithm identification results was 28 72 the maximum relative error of the asaco algorithm identification results was 14 8 while the maximum relative error of the enkf asaco algorithm was only 12 04 further calculation showed that the mre of the aco algorithm identification results was 10 99 and it was reduced to 6 55 after using the asaco algorithm in contrast after using the enkf asaco algorithm the mre was directly reduced to 3 6 thus the previous aco algorithm had the worst identification accuracy the asaco algorithm was better than the aco algorithm generally and the enkf asaco algorithm had the highest identification accuracy compared with the previous aco algorithm and the asaco algorithm the enkf asaco algorithm proposed in this study can effectively reduce the overall error level of the identification results and improve the identification accuracy in particular the pollution source release intensity s identification accuracy was significantly higher than that of the previous aco algorithm therefore it can be seen from the above comparison and analysis that the asaco algorithm greatly improved both the convergence speed and identification accuracy compared with the previous aco algorithm it was proved that the adaptive step length search strategy adopted in this study was effective in improving the previous aco algorithm in addition the enkf asaco algorithm obtained by using enkf to provide an initial point improved the search efficiency and identification accuracy compared with the asaco algorithm it was proved that this improvement of providing a good initial point with enkf for the optimization algorithm in this study was also valid therefore the two improvements proposed in this paper were effective for the optimization algorithm no matter which one was used alone there is no doubt that compared with the previous aco algorithm that has no improvement the enkf asaco algorithm proposed in this paper by combining the two improvements has the most obvious effect this is superior to any single improvement based on the above comparison and analysis on the one hand compared with the single enkf algorithm the enkf asaco algorithm can improve the overall identification accuracy on the other hand compared with the single optimization algorithms aco and asaco the enkf asaco algorithm can accelerate the convergence speed and improve search efficiency moreover the proposed algorithm can avoid falling into the local optimum to some extent and improve the identification accuracy therefore the new algorithm proposed in this paper is superior to the three single algorithms which is very effective and feasible to further verify the reliability and robustness of the proposed algorithm in the real scenario the observed concentrations calculated by the simulation model were perturbed by the normally distributed errors that simulated the measurement errors fig 9 shows the comparison between the actual values and the identification results of the enkf asaco algorithm in the scenarios of observed concentrations with and without measurement errors the horizontal coordinate represents nine variables to be solved the first two variables to be solved the location of the pollution source refer to the scale values of the left vertical axis and the last seven variables to be solved refer to the scale values of the right vertical axis for each of these variables the first bar represents the actual value the second represents the identification value of the enkf asaco algorithm based on observed concentrations without errors and the third bar represents the identification value based on observed concentrations with measurement errors the noise intensity was equal to 0 1 as seen in fig 9 compared with the enkf asaco algorithm in the scenario with measurement errors the identification results of the enkf asaco algorithm in the scenario without measurement errors were more accurate and closer to the actual values it was calculated that the mre of the enkf asaco algorithm was 3 6 when there were no errors and the mre was 7 02 when there were errors although the accuracy was affected when we had the measurement errors the identification results of the enkf asaco algorithm still maintained a good accuracy its performance was satisfactory and encouraging therefore the enkf asaco algorithm proposed in this paper is still applicable and effective for a real scenario with measurement errors 4 3 discussion the surrogate model can approximate the input output response of the simulation model with a smaller computational load and ensure a better accuracy therefore the research of the surrogate model has fundamental theoretical and practical significance although in this study the kriging method was adopted to build a surrogate model in the future the deep learning method can be studied to build a surrogate model to improve the accuracy further however no matter what method is used to construct the surrogate model of the simulation model there are often some errors between the surrogate model and the simulation model which may have a slight impact on the subsequent identification results this study did not take this as the research focus and further exploration and research on related aspects can be carried out in the future in solving the gcsi problems the so method has been most widely used but the optimization algorithms in the so method often rely on the selection of an initial point if the initial point is far from the actual value the convergence speed of the algorithm will be slow and it will easily fall into the local optimum so it is difficult to obtain the accurate identification results of the pollution source some researchers embedded the homotopy algorithm into the optimization algorithm to solve the problem hou et al 2021 li et al 2021 however the homotopy algorithm will greatly increase the time cost in recent years the enkf algorithm as a kf method has been widely used in gcsi due to its advantages of simple invocation and fast running speed its limitation is that when the inverse problem has a strong nonlinearity its identification accuracy needs improvement inspired by previous studies and thinking this study combined two different methods the kf and so methods to alleviate the problem that the optimization algorithm easily falls into the local optimum and complement the optimization ability of the enkf algorithm to some extent in future gcsi studies researchers are encouraged to combine different methods give full attention to the advantages of each method and learn from each other to overcome the limitations of a single method this will provide a more accurate basis for the design of groundwater pollution remediation schemes and risk assessment in real scenarios measurement errors often exist in observed data the enkf asaco algorithm proposed in this paper had been tested by considering measurement errors and its performance was satisfactory and encouraging it shows that this algorithm is effective and robust even in the scenario with errors however gcsi is dependent on observed data and measurement errors in the observed data may directly affect the accuracy of identification results therefore the enkf asaco algorithm constructed in this paper had a lower identification accuracy in the scenario with errors than in the scenario without errors denoising will be effective before using the observed data in real scenarios but this is beyond the scope of this study relevant research will be carried out in the future 5 conclusions this study constructed an enkf asaco algorithm which was used to identify pollution source characteristics and simulation model parameters simultaneously firstly the enkf algorithm was used for identification and the identification results were regarded as the initial point of the optimization algorithm on this basis the adaptive step length search strategy was used to improve the aco algorithm and the asaco algorithm was obtained as a result it made the step length change adaptively at the same time to reduce the huge computational load caused by repeatedly calling the numerical simulation model the kriging method was used to establish a surrogate model of the simulation model finally the identification results of the enkf previous aco asaco and enkf asaco algorithms were compared and analyzed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed new algorithm additionally the enkf asaco algorithm was also applied to a scenario with measurement errors to further test the robustness and reliability in the real scenario the conclusions are as follows 1 in gcsi the kriging method was used to build the surrogate model of the simulation model which can significantly reduce the huge calculation load caused by repeatedly calling to the simulation model improving the inversion efficiency and ensuring a high approximation accuracy 2 in this paper the enkf asaco algorithm was used to simultaneously identify unknown pollution source characteristics and simulation model parameters including pollution source location horizontal coordinate and longitudinal coordinate pollution source release intensity in three stress periods hydraulic conductivity of three zones and longitudinal dispersity of the whole region the identification results were compared and analyzed with those of the enkf previous aco and asaco algorithms the results show that compared with the three single algorithms the enkf asaco algorithm proposed in this paper can speed up the convergence and improve the search efficiency moreover the proposed algorithm can avoid falling into local optimum to some extent and improve the identification accuracy which is very effective and feasible 3 in real scenarios measurement errors often exist in observed data the enkf asaco algorithm was also applied to a scenario with measurement errors the results show that the enkf asaco algorithm can still maintain a good identification accuracy and the robustness and reliability are further verified declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

3756,climate and vegetation changes are main factors influencing water partitioning however their impacts on water partitioning are still not well understood to revisit the interactions among climate vegetation and water partitioning this study introduces the climate seasonality cs and vegetation seasonality vs into the budyko framework by using a statistical approach combining the three parameter log logistic probability distribution and multiple linear regression based on the monthly p et 0 precipitation p minus potential evapotranspiration et 0 and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi this method is then validated and applied in 86 global catchments to quantify the contribution of climate and vegetation changes to evapotranspiration et results show that this model can predict well mean r 2 0 81 0 05 p 0 05 the parameter n a parameter reflecting the interactions between land surface and atmosphere in the budyko framework more importantly cs and vs jointly control the variation in parameter n and in average jointly contribute more mean relative contribution of 57 1 2 3 than the changes in p and et 0 mean of 42 9 2 3 to et these indicate that cs and vs are at least as important as the changes in p and et 0 in affecting water balance furthermore the vs contributes slightly lower mean of 24 9 0 3 than the cs does mean of 32 2 2 3 implying that cs and vs play comparable roles in water partitioning these findings would be valuable for water resources management and assessing the impacts of climate and land surface changes on water balance in a gradually changing environment keywords water balance climate change eco hydrology vegetation dynamics 1 introduction knowledge of the water cycle is essential for understanding hydrological phenomena including water partitioning runoff parameters agricultural water demands and supplies and diverse ecological processes donohue et al 2011 oki and kanae 2006 padrón et al 2017 understanding the factors influencing them the mechanisms involved and water behavior is particularly important to meet the challenges posed by the anticipated environmental changes allan and soden 2008 easterling et al 2000 vorosmarty et al 2000 climate and vegetation changes have long been recognized as important factors affecting water prtitioning donohue et al 2011 hickel and zhang 2006 porporato et al 2004 vorosmarty et al 2000 zhang et al 2016 however there is still no common view on the impacts of vegetation changes on catchment water partitioning padrón et al 2017 some studies concluded that vegetation changes contribute highly to water partitioning troch et al 2013 williams et al 2012 for example ning et al 2017 found that vegetation changes contributed 0 1 111 3 to the changes in et on the loess plateau however there also exist some studies reported poor relationships between vegetation and water partitioning padrón et al 2017 for example yang et al 2014b and liu et al 2016 found no significant relationship between water partitioning and vegetation cover and padrón et al 2017 concluded that vegetation related indices play a minor and often nonsignificant role in 2733 global catchments to explain why there exist quite different or even contradictory findings on this issue there would be several reasons first the contribution of climate and vegetation changes in water partitioning are associated with hydrogeology basis climatology and the magnitudes of the changes in climate and vegetation donohue et al 2010 zhou et al 2015a for example on the loess plateau where vegetation changes dramatically liang et al 2015 vegetation changes play considerable or even dominating roles in water partitioning ning et al 2017 second the roles played by vegetation in catchment hydrology are associated with the spatial and temporal scales for example donohue et al 2010 found that at the annual average temporal scale vegetation related variables are not the primary determinants at coarse spatial scales but become dominating factor at medium spatial scales indeed these studies which conclude non significant contribution of vegetation changes in water partitioning are generaly based on a long term basis liu et al 2016 padrón et al 2017 yang et al 2014a third previous studies often employed mean vegetaiton information to reflect vegetation changes e g using annual mean or mean annual remotely sensed ndvi li et al 2013 liu et al 2018a ning et al 2017 xu et al 2013 zhang et al 2018 mean vegetation information can integratively reflect climate seasonality soil properties and topographic features li et al 2013 xu et al 2013 however the phenology and growth of vegetation are often sensitive to the changing environment e g droughts deb et al 2019 deb et al 2020 gentine et al 2012 saft et al 2015 which should exert deep impacts on the eco hydrological processes in other words vegetation seasonality e g phenology and growth would make water partitioning to change along with seasons liu et al 2017 roderick and farquhar 2011 even though the annual mean vegetation indices in a specific catchment change slightly therefore it is essential to take vegetation seasonality into

discharge and et to the changing environment the budyko framework budyko 1974 fu 1981 yang et al 2008 has been frequently used liang et al 2015 liu et al 2016 roderick and farquhar 2011 yang and yang 2011 zeng and cai 2015 zhou et al 2015a the budyko formula links the et or runoff precipitation p and potential evapotranspiration et0 and other factors such as land surface changes and human activities by using a integrative catchment parameter roderick and farquhar 2011 which represents the interactions between the land surface and atmosphere berghuijs and woods 2016 liu et al 2017 e g

the relationship between the contributors and catchment parameter e g parameter n in the choudhury s formula choudhury 1999 or parameter ω in fu s equation fu 1981 is needed beforehand thus many studies tried to develop empirical or semi empirical models to link the catchment parameter and its potential contributors li et al 2013 liang et al 2015 liu et al 2018a ning et al 2017 yang et al 2007 to explain the variability in the catchment parameter two kinds of factors are usually used one is related to the land surface conditions such as vegetation dynamics soil properties topography donohue et al 2010a li et al 2013 liang et al 2015 yang et al 2007 and another one is related to the climate variability in addition to p and et0 donohue et al 2012 hickel and zhang 2006 milly 1994 ning et al 2017 potter et al 2005 compared to vegetation and climate other catchment properties such as soil properties and topography are relatively stable therefore many current studies tried to introduce more detailed information of climate seasonality and vegetation dynamics into the budyko framework berghuijs and woods 2016 liu et al 2018a ning et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 in particular when introducing climate seasonality to the budyko framework the milly s method milly 1994 woods 2003 has been widely used berghuijs et al 2014 liu et al 2018a ning et al 2017 which can effectively capture the seasonal patterns of climatic variables however when introducing vegetation related information annual mean or mean annual vegetation indices e g remotely sensed ndvi are usually used for example ning et al 2017 developed a semi empirical model considering climate seasonality milly s method and vegetation coverage derived using annual mean ndvi for predicting the parameter ω in fu s formula fu 1981 over the loess plateau however mean annual or annual mean vegetation indices cannot reflect the seasonal vegetation dynamics which have noticeable impacts on water partitioning thus how vegetation dynamics and climate seasonality jointly affect the variabilities in water partitioning needs further interpretation therefore the primary motivation of this study is to revisit the relationhips among vegetation dynamics climate changes and water partitioning which are regionally constrained in most cases and even contradictory sometimes the specific objectives are 1 to develop a new method to introduce more detailed information of climate and vegetation changes to the budyko framework and 2 to validate and apply the new method in global catchments for quantifying the impacts of vegetation and climate dynamics on water partitioning the main advantages of this study are the development of a new method to introduce climate and vegetation seasonality into the budyko framework and the demonstration of the importance of vegetation seasonality in water partitioning the findings would provide valuable insights for eco hydrological model development watershed management and the assessment of water resources in a changing environment 2 data and methods 2 1 data sources long term natural runoff q in a total of 86 global catchments fig 1 are collected from the hydrological yearbooks of the people s republic of china a total of 54 catchments and pan et al 2012 a total of 32 catchments the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi which is used as the surrogate to reflect vegetation condition are collected from the gimms ndvi3g dataset 1982 2010 s https ecocast arc nasa gov data pub gimms anyamba et al 2014 the precipitation p and potential evapotranspiration et 0 in the pan s catchments are from the pan s datasets and the meteorological data at a total of 319 stations in the 54 catchments in china are from the china meteorological data service center http data cma cn en in particular the et 0 in these 54 catchments in china are calculated using the penman method penman 1948 of which the details can be found in liu et al 2016 the catchment scale monthly p et 0 monthly total are calculated by arithmetically averaging the data at all the meteorological stations note that the data in the 32 large catchments provided by pan et al 2012 are already catchment scale and ndvi is calculated by arithmetically averaging the data at all the pixels in each catchment note that all the data are constrained in the period of 1982 2012 due to the different time coverages of varying datasets 2 2 temporal parameter n in the choudhury s formula this study employs the choudhury s formula choudhury 1999 to quantify the catchment water partitioning 1 et p et 0 p n et 0 n 1 n where p et and et 0 are the long term mean annual precipitation actual evapotranspiration and potential evapotranspiration respectively parameter n is generally considered as the catchment parameter roderick and farquhar 2011 wang and hejazi 2011 zeng and cai 2015 which reflects the interactions among climate vegetation human activities and water balance liu et al 2017 to calculate the temporal n eq 1 and minimize the impacts of changes in water storage a relative long term overlapping moving windows approach is employed liu et al 2017 these windows are denoted as win i of which the subscript i is the starting year of the window in order to determine the appropriate time scale of the moving window the errors resulting from the time scales are evaluated using the pan s dataset which contains five hydrological components including the p et 0 actual evapotranspiration et runoff q and the changes in water storage δ s pan et al 2012 in particular the changes in et δ e t relative to long term mean et considering δ s denoted as δ e t δ s and δ e t without considering δ s δ et n o δ s in each win i are calculated as 2 δ e t δ s i p i q i δ s i et p i q i δ s i p q 3 δ e t n o δ s i p i q i et p i q i p q where p i q i δ s i are the mean annual et p q and δ s in win i et p and q are the long term mean annual et p and q based on these the error brought by the moving window approach is measured using the relative root mean square error rrmse 4 rrmse 1 1 m i 1 m δ e t δ s i 1 m i 1 m δ e t δ s i δ e t n o δ s i 2 where m is the number of the window these analyses are conducted for 10 moving windows of which the time scale ranges from 1 year to 10 year fig 2 from fig 2 it is clear that the rrmse decreases with increasing time scale and the relationship between the rrsmse and time scale can be well fitted using the power function r 2 0 9 fig 2 when the time scale of the window is longer than 4 years the rrmse decreases to be a very low level 4 0 these results indicate that 5 year 10 year moving windows are appropriate to reduce errors brought by ignoring the changes in water storage δ s according to these results this study selects 5 year 10 year moving windows a total of six moving windows to calculate the temporal n using different moving windows to quantify the uncertainties in particular the n i in win i is calculated by numerically solving eq 1 et is calculated by using water balance et p q based on the mean annual p et 0 and q in win i from year i to year i s c l 1 of which the scl is the time scale of the window for example when the data series covers 1982 2012 and the time scale of the moving window is 5 year then there are a total of 27 win i and thus 27 n i similarly when the data series covers 1982 2012 and the time scale of the moving window is 10 year then there are a total of 22 win i and thus 22 n i 2 3 climate and vegetation seasonality indicators milly s method milly 1994 and its modified versions are widely used to introduce climate seasonality to the budyko framework berghuijs et al 2014 liu et al 2018a milly 1994 ning et al 2017 potter et al 2005 woods 2003 woods 2009 these methods model p and et 0 separately using trigonometric functions e g sine function however many studies have demonstrated that p and et 0 are usually coupled with each other e g negative correlation between p and et 0 adler et al 2008 koster et al 2009 yin et al 2014 in order to model the closely coupled p and et 0 this study constructs a variable p et 0 p minus et 0 which provides a simple measure of water deficit vicente serrano et al 2010 note that choudhury s formula can be regarded as a function of et 0 p padrón et al 2017 zhou et al 2015b therefore the ratio et 0 p seems to be more reasonable for characterizing climate seasonality however the ratio et 0 p has a shortcoming that it is not defined when p 0 which is common in short periods e g monthly the p et 0 is calculated at monthly scale in each win i section 2 2 for example there are a total of 120 p et 0 values in each win i when the time scale is 10 year e g 1982 1991 these p et 0 series are denoted as p et 0 i k of which the k is the order number of the month in win i to quantify the probability structure of p et 0 i k the three parameter log logistic distribution is employed with the following cumulative distribution function f x 5 f x 1 x γ α β 1 where α β and γ are the scale shape and origin parameters respectively the parameters α β and γ are estimated based on the l moment approach vicente serrano et al 2010 note that the same methods mentioned above are also used to quantify the probability structure of the monthly ndvi i k data show that the three parameter log logistic distribution can fit p et 0 i k and ndvi i k series well fig 3 the correlations between the modeled cumulative probability and the empirical cumulative probability for p et 0 i k and ndvi i k are 0 99 0 01 mean 1sd sd is the standard deviation among the results derived using different moving windows similarly hereinafter and 0 97 0 02 respectively within the three parameter log logistic distribution when β and γ remain stable and α decreases fig 4 a or when α and γ remain stable and β decreases fig 4 b the curve tends to move to the left thus decreases in α and β increase the likelihood of low p et 0 or low ndvi moreover a decrease in β indicates a greater likelihood of extreme p et 0 ndvi and a larger dispersion of p et 0 ndvi fig 4 b in other words the distribution of p et 0 or ndvi would be more similar to the normal distribution when the parameter α and β are increasing on the other hand decrease increase in γ does not alter the shape of the probability density curve but can move it to the left right fig 4 c meaning that the value overall tends to decrease increase therefore the parameters α β and γ are used as the seasonality indicators for p et 0 and ndvi in particular those for p et 0 i k are denoted α cs β cs γ cs and those for ndvi i k are denoted as α vs β vs γ vs 2 4 empirical formula for parameter n there are a total of six indicators for the climate and vegetation seasonality thus it is difficult to develop a simple equation to link the seasonality indicators and parameter n this study tries to develop a formula in each catchment by using the multiple regression method before conducting the multiple regression the relationships among parameter n and the six indicators are investigated fig 5 results show that in most of the catchments there is at least one seasonality indicator that is highly and linearly correlated to the parameter n the mean maximum correlation over all the catchments the mean of the maximum correlation between parameter n and the six indicators is 0 61 0 22 on the other hand results also show that the correlations between parameter n and the seasonality indicators in all the catchments are highly correlated to each other fig 5 these suggest that the cs and vs indicators are linearly related to the parameter n according to these a multiple linear formula is developed to link the parameter n and the cs and vs indicators 6 n a α cs b β cs c γ cs d α vs e β vs f γ vs where a b c d e and f are the regression coefficients α cs β cs and γ cs are the cs indicators and α vs β vs and γ vs are the vs indicators 2 5 responses of parameter n to the cs and vs the effects of cs and vs changes on parameter n is evaluated by using a scenario analysis approach according to eq 6 two scenarios are designed of which one is designed for reflecting the impacts of cs changes n cs resulting from climate seasonality and another one is used to represent the impacts of vs changes n vs resulting from vegetation seasonality the parameter n under these two scenarios are calculated as 7a n csi a α csi b β csi c γ csi d α v s 1 e β v s 1 f γ v s 1 7b n vsi a α c s 1 b β c s 1 c γ c s 1 d α vsi e β vsi f γ vsi where n csi and n vsi are the n cs and n vs in win i and α csi β csi γ csi are the α cs β cs γ cs in win i and similarly the α vsi β vsi γ vsi are the α vs β vs γ vs in win i and the α c s 1 β c s 1 γ c s 1 α v s 1 β v s 1 γ v s 1 are the α cs β cs γ cs α vs β vs γ vs in the first window win 1 respectively then the trends in n csi denoted as t r e n d n cs and n vsi denoted as t r e n d n vs are detected using the modified pre whitening mann kendall trend test kendall 1975 mann 1945 yue and wang 2002 and the magnitude of each trend is estimated by using the sen s slope burn and elnur 2002 as presented above the t r e n d n cs means the trend in parameter n caused by cs changes and t r e n d n vs means the trend in parameter n caused by vs changes to quantify the relative contributions of cs and vs changes to parameter n the absolute mean contribution is employed 8a c o n n cs t r e n d n cs t r e n d n cs t r e n d n vs 100 8b c o n n vs t r e n d n vs t r e n d n cs t r e n d n vs 100 where c o n n cs is the relative contribution of cs changes and c o n n vs is the relative contribution of vs changes to the changes in parameter n 2 6 relative contributions of cs and vs in water partitioning because that the et 0 and p are coupled together and their relationship are not clear it is not suitable to derive the sensitivity or elasticity formulas for runoff or evapotranspiration using partial differential which is based on the assumption that et 0 p and n are independent of each other this study develops a scenario analysis approach within which a total of five scenarios were designed table 1 to separate the contribution of each contributor the trends in the modeled et under different scenarios are detected using the mann kendall trend test and are demoted as t r e n d e cs t r e n d e vs t r e n d e csvs t r e n d e cc and t r e n d e all respectively table 1 the performance of the scenarios analysis approach is validated by comparing the t r e n d e all trend in et derived using the scenario approach to the observed trends in et derived based on water balance p q based on these the t r e n d e cs t r e n d e vs t r e n d e csvs t r e n d e cc and t r e n d e all are compared to each other for investigating the contribution of changes in p and et 0 cs and vs to water partitioning because that the signs of t r e n d e cs t r e n d e vs t r e n d e csvs and t r e n d e cc would be negative or positive the relative contributions of different factors are quantified based on their absolute values in particular the relative contribution of t r e n d e cs t r e n d e vs t r e n d e csvs and t r e n d e cc to et are calculated as 9a concs t r e n d e cs t r e n d e cs t r e n d e vs t r e n d e cc 100 9b convs t r e n d e vs t r e n d e cs t r e n d e vs t r e n d e cc 100 9c concc t r e n d e cc t r e n d e cs t r e n d e vs t r e n d e cc 100 9d concsvs 1 t r e n d e cc t r e n d e cs t r e n d e vs t r e n d e cc 100 where concs convs concc and concsvs represents the relative contribution resulting from changes in cs changes in vs changes in p and et0 and changes in both cs and vs respectively these relative contributions are calculated and compared under different moving widows 5 year 10 year to quantify the uncertainties resulting from the moving window approach 3 results 3 1 performance of the predicting model for parameter n the determination coefficient r 2 for eq 6 ranges from 0 37 to 0 99 with a mean of 0 81 0 05 fig 6 particularly the r 2 in 33 5 17 6 of the catchments are higher than 0 90 and 62 2 16 5 80 0 9 9 and 94 0 5 3 of the catchments have r 2 0 80 r 2 0 70 and r 2 0 50 respectively fig 7 shows three examples of the performance of eq 6 in predicting parameter n clearly the regression coefficients between the modeled n derived based on eq 6 and observed n derived based on eq 1 using p q and et 0 are near 1 0 fig 7 these indicate that the eq 6 works well in modeling parameter n by using the seasonality indicators 3 2 temporal patterns in parameter n and its components of these catchments 51 4 3 5 show positive t r e n d n trend in parameter n fig 8 a 42 3 0 9 and 56 0 4 6 exhibit positive t r e n d n cs trends in parameter n resulting from cs changes and t r e n d n vs trends in parameter n resulting from vs changes fig 8 b c overall the mean relative contributions of cs and vs to parameter n are 53 6 2 7 and 46 4 2 7 eq 8a and eq 8b respectively it is important to note that there is no significant relationship between t r e n d n d v i trend in ndvi and t r e n d n vs and between t r e n d p et 0 trend in p et 0 and t r e n d n cs data not shown here however significant relationship between annual mean ndvi and parameter n e g n 0 1 e 0 5 n d v i r 2 0 75 p 0 05 can be found in the 13 catchments on the loess plateau where large scale ecological restoration has been implemented during the past decades liang et al 2015 ning et al 2017 3 3 contribution of climate and vegetation variability to et and the uncertainties regardless of the time scales of the moving windows 5 year 10 year the t r e n d e all trend in et derived using the scenario analysis approach and observed trend in et derived using water balance et p q are very close to each other fig 9 a the mean determination r 2 and regression coefficient the slope of the regression model linking t r e n d e all and the observed trend in et are 0 94 0 04 and 1 04 0 03 respectively these results demonstrate that the scenario analysis approach is effective and reliable on the other hand the t r e n d e all t r e n d e cc trend in et resulting from changes in p and et 0 t r e n d e csvs trend in et resulting from cs and vs changes t r e n d e cs trend in et resulted by cs changes and t r e n d e vs trend in et resulted by vs changes derived based on different moving windows are highly and linearly correlated to each other fig 9 b c d e for example the determination coefficient and regression coefficient between the t r e n d e all derived using 5 year and 6 year moving windows are 0 97 and 1 02 fig 9 b and those between the t r e n d e csvs derived using 5 year and 6 year moving windows are 0 96 and 1 04 fig 9 c these suggest that the results derived from different moving windows are robust based on these methods results show that that of all the catchments 51 2 2 7 51 6 1 4 52 3 3 3 42 1 1 5 and 57 0 4 4 of the catchments exhibit positive t r e n d e all t r e n d e cc t r e n d e c s v s t r e n d e cs and t r e n d e vs respectively fig 10 more importantly 61 0 3 0 of the catchments exhibit higher concsvs contribution of cs and vs eq 9d than concc contribution of changes in p and et 0 eq 9c and 44 2 5 3 have higher convs contribution of vs eq 9a than the concs contribution of cs eq 9b overall the mean concc concsvs concs and convs are 42 9 2 3 57 1 2 3 32 2 2 3 and 24 9 0 3 respectively fig 9 f 4 discussion this study develops a simple water deficit item p et 0 and employs the three parameter log logistic distribution which can fit the probability of p et 0 and ndvi well the correlation are higher than 0 95 fig 3 to quantify the probability distribution of p et 0 and ndvi for representing their seasonality based on these the parameters of the three parameter log logistic distribution namely the α β and γ are used as the seasonality indicators as these three parameters can reproduce the probability distribution of the p et 0 or ndvi fig 4 the high determination coefficient r 2 of the multiple linear regression in most of the catchments mean r 2 of 0 81 0 05 fig 6 demonstrate that this method can predict parameter n well fig 7 meanwhile the high determination coefficient r 2 0 94 0 04 p 0 05 and the regression coefficient 1 04 0 03 between the modeled using the scenario analysis approach and observed trends in et derived based on water balance et p q fig 9 a illustrate the effectiveness and reliability of the methods used for separating the contribution of varying contributors to the changes in et in statistics the determination coefficient r 2 generally indicates the proportion of the variance of the dependent variable here the parameter n that can be predicted from the independent variables cs and vs indicators in this case gujarati and porter 2009 therefore the high r 2 also implies that cs and vs jointly control the variance in parameter n regardless of the location hydrogeology basis climate types of the catchment averagely the vs mean relative contribution of 53 6 2 7 plays a similar role in controlling the parameter n as the cs does mean relative contribution of 46 4 2 7 these are in good agreement with the findings presented in liu et al 2018a which pointed out that vegetation dynamics and climate seasonality can explain 67 and 46 of the variance of parameter n in the 26 global large catchments by using a quite different method in the same catchments the results in this study are 52 2 3 4 and 47 8 3 4 meanwhile in accordance with many previous studies liu et al 2016 padrón et al 2017 yang et al 2014a no significant correlation between parameter n and mean ndvi and mean p et 0 can be found in most of the catchments the explanation is that the mean ndvi and p et 0 miss the seasonality information seasonal variation of climate and vegetation respectively however in some catchments with dramatic vegetation changes vegetation dynamics control the variance in parameter n zhang et al 2018 for example in the 13 catchments on the loess plateau where a large scale green for grain has been implemented liu et al 2018b the parameter n is highly related to the annual mean ndvi e g n 0 1 e 0 5 n d v i r 2 0 75 p 0 05 since the cs and vs jointly control the changes in parameter n they affect water partitioning significantly fig 9 10 overall the cs and vs mean relative contribution of 57 1 2 3 averagely play more important roles in water partitioning than the changes in p and et 0 mean relative contribution of 42 9 2 3 fig 9 f moreover the cs mean relative contribution of 32 2 2 3 contributes slightly higher than the vs mean relative contribution of 24 9 0 3 fig 9 f these results demonstrate that both the cs and vs are critical factors affecting water balance these findings are in line with those in ning et al 2017 which pointed out that the contributions of climate seasonality to et ranges from 0 1 to 74 8 in the 13 catchments on the loess plateau in the same catchments the values in this study are in the range from 4 4 3 8 to 79 0 9 6 the differences may be resulted from that the model used in ning et al 2017 is based on annual mean ndvi which miss the seasonal information of vegetation besides the advantages of this study several limitations and uncertainties should be noted first the empirical parameter n predicting model is based on multiple linear regression the six vs and cs indicators make it difficult to develop a physical model for parameter n to address this issue this study develops a multiple linear regression model to link the parameter n and the indicators based on the facts that in each catchment there is at least one seasonality indicator being highly and linearly correlated to the parameter n thus though the regression model works well in predicting parameter n it is still lack of physical basis because the climate and vegetation seasonality may interact nonlinearly in the budyko framework second this study employs a relative long term e g 5 year 10 year overlapping moving window approach to minimize the impacts of ignoring the changes in water storage though the changes in water storage have been demonstrated to be small compared to other hydrological components e g p and et 0 at a relative long term time scale it can still affect the parameter n and consequently the final results third the climate and vegetation seasonality are associated closely with each other in other words vegetation seasonality would not be strictly independent from climate seasonality as vegetation growth is highly affected by the climate conditions therefore the methods presented above cannot strictly separate the relative contributions of vs and cs to et forth human activities such as water resources regulation water conservancy projects construction and irrigation can have more or less impacts on water partitioning however these factors have not been considered in the model though vegetation dynamics can reflect some aspects of them therefore more work is still needed in future nevertheless this study proposes an effective method for introducing the cs and vs to the budyko framework and reveals that the joint contribution of cs and vs in water balance are even more important than the changes in p and et 0 and demonstrates that the vs and cs are as important as each other in water partitioning these findings would be helpful for many eco hydrology related fields such as water resources management eco hydrological modelling and assessing the changes in water resources in future 5 conclusion this study develops a new method to introduce the climate seasonality cs and vegetation seasonality vs into the budyko framework particularly the scale α shape β and origin γ parameter of the three parameter log logistic distribution which fitting the monthly p et 0 and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi are used as the cs and vs indicators and the multiple linear regression is employed to link the parameter n and seasonality indicators then this method is validated and applied in global catchments to revisit the relationships among water partitioning climate and vegetation changes results show that this method can predict parameter n well r 2 0 81 0 05 over global catchments besides these the high determination coefficients of the empirical model also indicate that cs and vs jointly control the variance in parameter n moreover the joint contribution of cs and vs to et mean relative contribution of 57 1 2 3 is slightly higher than the changes in p and et 0 mean relative contribution of 42 9 2 3 and the roles played by the cs mean absolute contribution of 32 2 2 3 are slightly more important than the vs mean relative contribution of 24 9 0 3 these results indicate that both the vs and cs are two critical factors of water partitioning these findings would be valuable and helpful for water resources management and assessing the responses of

3756,climate and vegetation changes are main factors influencing water partitioning however their impacts on water partitioning are still not well understood to revisit the interactions among climate vegetation and water partitioning this study introduces the climate seasonality cs and vegetation seasonality vs into the budyko framework by using a statistical approach combining the three parameter log logistic probability distribution and multiple linear regression based on the monthly p et 0 precipitation p minus potential evapotranspiration et 0 and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi this method is then validated and applied in 86 global catchments to quantify the contribution of climate and vegetation changes to evapotranspiration et results show that this model can predict well mean r 2 0 81 0 05 p 0 05 the parameter n a parameter reflecting the interactions between land surface and atmosphere in the budyko framework more importantly cs and vs jointly control the variation in parameter n and in average jointly contribute more mean relative contribution of 57 1 2 3 than the changes in p and et 0 mean of 42 9 2 3 to et these indicate that cs and vs are at least as important as the changes in p and et 0 in affecting water balance furthermore the vs contributes slightly lower mean of 24 9 0 3 than the cs does mean of 32 2 2 3 implying that cs and vs play comparable roles in water partitioning these findings would be valuable for water resources management and assessing the impacts of climate and land surface changes on water balance in a gradually changing environment keywords water balance climate change eco hydrology vegetation dynamics 1 introduction knowledge of the water cycle is essential for understanding hydrological phenomena including water partitioning runoff parameters agricultural water demands and supplies and diverse ecological processes donohue et al 2011 oki and kanae 2006 padrón et al 2017 understanding the factors influencing them the mechanisms involved and water behavior is particularly important to meet the challenges posed by the anticipated environmental changes allan and soden 2008 easterling et al 2000 vorosmarty et al 2000 climate and vegetation changes have long been recognized as important factors affecting water prtitioning donohue et al 2011 hickel and zhang 2006 porporato et al 2004 vorosmarty et al 2000 zhang et al 2016 however there is still no common view on the impacts of vegetation changes on catchment water partitioning padrón et al 2017 some studies concluded that vegetation changes contribute highly to water partitioning troch et al 2013 williams et al 2012 for example ning et al 2017 found that vegetation changes contributed 0 1 111 3 to the changes in et on the loess plateau however there also exist some studies reported poor relationships between vegetation and water partitioning padrón et al 2017 for example yang et al 2014b and liu et al 2016 found no significant relationship between water partitioning and vegetation cover and padrón et al 2017 concluded that vegetation related indices play a minor and often nonsignificant role in 2733 global catchments to explain why there exist quite different or even contradictory findings on this issue there would be several reasons first the contribution of climate and vegetation changes in water partitioning are associated with hydrogeology basis climatology and the magnitudes of the changes in climate and vegetation donohue et al 2010 zhou et al 2015a for example on the loess plateau where vegetation changes dramatically liang et al 2015 vegetation changes play considerable or even dominating roles in water partitioning ning et al 2017 second the roles played by vegetation in catchment hydrology are associated with the spatial and temporal scales for example donohue et al 2010 found that at the annual average temporal scale vegetation related variables are not the primary determinants at coarse spatial scales but become dominating factor at medium spatial scales indeed these studies which conclude non significant contribution of vegetation changes in water partitioning are generaly based on a long term basis liu et al 2016 padrón et al 2017 yang et al 2014a third previous studies often employed mean vegetaiton information to reflect vegetation changes e g using annual mean or mean annual remotely sensed ndvi li et al 2013 liu et al 2018a ning et al 2017 xu et al 2013 zhang et al 2018 mean vegetation information can integratively reflect climate seasonality soil properties and

2012 saft et al 2015 which should exert deep impacts on the eco hydrological processes in other words vegetation seasonality e g phenology and growth would make water partitioning to change along with

2011 zeng and cai 2015 zhou et al 2015a the budyko formula links the et or runoff precipitation p and potential evapotranspiration et0 and other factors such as land surface changes and human

2007 to explain the variability in the catchment parameter two kinds of factors are usually used one is related to the land surface conditions such as vegetation dynamics soil properties topography donohue et al 2010a li et al 2013 liang et al 2015 yang et al 2007 and another one is related to the climate variability in addition to p and et0 donohue et al 2012 hickel and zhang 2006 milly 1994 ning et al 2017 potter et al 2005 compared to vegetation and climate other catchment properties such as soil properties and topography are relatively stable therefore many current studies tried to introduce more detailed information of climate seasonality and vegetation dynamics into the budyko framework berghuijs and woods 2016 liu et al 2018a ning et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 in particular when introducing climate seasonality to the budyko framework the milly s method milly 1994 woods 2003 has been widely used berghuijs et al 2014 liu et al 2018a ning et al 2017 which can effectively capture the seasonal patterns of climatic variables however when introducing vegetation related information annual mean or mean annual vegetation indices e g remotely sensed ndvi are usually used for example ning et al 2017 developed a semi empirical model considering climate seasonality milly s method and vegetation coverage derived using annual mean ndvi for predicting the parameter ω in fu s formula fu 1981 over the loess plateau however mean annual or annual mean vegetation indices cannot reflect the seasonal vegetation dynamics which have noticeable impacts on water partitioning thus how vegetation dynamics and climate seasonality jointly affect the variabilities in water partitioning needs further interpretation therefore the primary motivation of this study is to revisit the relationhips among vegetation dynamics climate changes and water partitioning which are regionally constrained in most cases and even contradictory sometimes the specific objectives are 1 to develop a new method to introduce more detailed information of climate and vegetation changes to the budyko framework and 2 to validate and apply the new method in global catchments for quantifying the impacts of vegetation and climate dynamics on water partitioning the main advantages of this study are the development of a new method to introduce climate and vegetation seasonality into the budyko framework and the demonstration of the importance of vegetation seasonality in water partitioning the findings would provide valuable insights for eco hydrological model development watershed management and the assessment of water resources in a changing environment 2 data and methods 2 1 data sources long term natural runoff q in a total of 86 global catchments fig 1 are collected from the hydrological yearbooks of the people s republic of china a total of 54 catchments and pan et al 2012 a total of 32 catchments the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi which is used as the surrogate to reflect vegetation condition are collected from the gimms ndvi3g dataset 1982 2010 s https ecocast arc nasa gov data pub gimms anyamba et al 2014 the precipitation p and potential evapotranspiration et 0 in the pan s catchments are from the pan s datasets and the meteorological data at a total of 319 stations in the 54 catchments in china are from the china meteorological data service center http data cma cn en in particular the et 0 in these 54 catchments in china are calculated using the penman method penman 1948 of which the details can be found in liu et al 2016 the catchment scale monthly p et 0 monthly total are calculated by arithmetically averaging the data at all the meteorological stations note that the data in the 32 large catchments provided by pan et al 2012 are already catchment scale and ndvi is calculated by arithmetically averaging the data at all the pixels in each catchment note that all the data are constrained in the period of 1982 2012 due to the different time coverages of varying datasets 2 2 temporal parameter n in the choudhury s formula this study employs the choudhury s formula choudhury 1999 to quantify the catchment water partitioning 1 et p et 0 p n et 0 n 1 n where p et and et 0 are the long term mean annual precipitation actual evapotranspiration and potential evapotranspiration respectively parameter n is generally considered as the catchment parameter roderick and farquhar 2011 wang and hejazi 2011 zeng and cai 2015 which reflects the interactions among climate vegetation human activities and water balance liu et al 2017 to calculate the temporal n eq 1 and minimize the impacts of changes in water storage a relative long term overlapping moving windows approach is employed liu et al 2017 these windows are denoted as win i of which the subscript i is the starting year of the window in order to determine the appropriate time scale of the moving window the errors resulting from the time scales are evaluated using the pan s dataset which contains five hydrological components including the p et 0 actual evapotranspiration et runoff q and the changes in water storage δ s pan et al 2012 in particular the changes in et δ e t relative to long term mean et considering δ s denoted as δ e t δ s and δ e t without considering δ s δ et n o δ s in each win i are calculated as 2 δ e t δ s i p i q i δ s i et p i q i δ s i p q 3 δ e t n o δ s i p i q i et p i q i p q where p i q i δ s i are the mean annual et p q and δ s in win i et p and q are the long term mean annual et p and q based on these the error brought by the moving window approach is measured using the relative root mean square error rrmse 4 rrmse 1 1 m i 1 m δ e t δ s i 1 m i 1 m δ e t δ s i δ e t n o δ s i 2 where m is the number of the window these analyses are conducted for 10 moving windows of which the time scale ranges from 1 year to 10 year fig 2 from fig 2 it is clear that the rrmse decreases with increasing time scale and the relationship between the rrsmse and time scale can be well fitted using the power function r 2 0 9 fig 2 when the time scale of the window is longer than 4 years the rrmse decreases to be a very low level 4 0 these results indicate that 5 year 10 year moving windows are appropriate to reduce errors brought by ignoring the changes in water storage δ s according to these results this study selects 5 year 10 year moving windows a total of six moving windows to calculate the temporal n using different moving windows to quantify the uncertainties in particular the n i in win i is calculated by numerically solving eq 1 et is calculated by using water balance et p q based on the mean annual p et 0 and q in win i from year i to year i s c l 1 of which the scl is the time scale of the window for example when the data series covers 1982 2012 and the time scale of the moving window is 5 year then there are a total of 27 win i and thus 27 n i similarly when the data series covers 1982 2012 and the time scale of the moving window is 10 year then there are a total of 22 win i and thus 22 n i 2 3 climate and vegetation seasonality indicators milly s method milly 1994 and its modified versions are widely used to introduce climate seasonality to the budyko framework berghuijs et al 2014 liu et al 2018a milly 1994 ning et al 2017 potter et al 2005 woods 2003 woods 2009 these methods model p and et 0 separately using trigonometric functions e g sine function however many studies have demonstrated that p and et 0 are usually coupled with each other e g negative correlation between p and et 0 adler et al 2008 koster et al 2009 yin et al 2014 in order to model the closely coupled p and et 0 this study constructs a variable p et 0 p minus et 0 which provides a simple measure of water deficit vicente serrano et al 2010 note that choudhury s formula can be regarded as a function of et 0 p padrón et al 2017 zhou et al 2015b therefore the ratio et 0 p seems to be more reasonable for characterizing climate seasonality however the ratio et 0 p has a shortcoming that it is not defined when p 0 which is common in short periods e g monthly the p et 0 is calculated at monthly scale in each win i section 2 2 for example there are a total of 120 p et 0 values in each win i when the time scale is 10 year e g 1982 1991 these p et 0 series are denoted as p et 0 i k of which the k is the order number of the month in win i to quantify the probability structure of p et 0 i k the three parameter log logistic distribution is employed with the following cumulative distribution function f x 5 f x 1 x γ α β 1 where α β and γ are the scale shape and origin parameters respectively the parameters α β and γ are estimated based on the l moment approach vicente serrano et al 2010 note that the same methods mentioned above are also used to quantify the probability structure of the monthly ndvi i k data show that the three parameter log logistic distribution can fit p et 0 i k and ndvi i k series well fig 3 the correlations between the modeled cumulative probability and the empirical cumulative probability for p et 0 i k and ndvi i k are 0 99 0 01 mean 1sd sd is the standard deviation among the results derived using different moving windows similarly hereinafter and 0 97 0 02 respectively within the three parameter log logistic distribution when β and γ remain stable and α decreases fig 4 a or when α and γ remain stable and β decreases fig 4 b the curve tends to move to the left thus decreases in α and β increase the likelihood of low p et 0 or low ndvi moreover a decrease in β indicates a greater likelihood of extreme p et 0 ndvi and a larger dispersion of p et 0 ndvi fig 4 b in other words the distribution of p et 0 or ndvi would be more similar to the normal distribution when the parameter α and β are increasing on the other hand decrease increase in γ does not alter the shape of the probability density curve but can move it to the left right fig 4 c meaning that the value overall tends to decrease increase therefore the parameters α β and γ are used as the seasonality indicators for p et 0 and ndvi in particular those for p et 0 i k are denoted α cs β cs γ cs and those for ndvi i k are denoted as α vs β vs γ vs 2 4 empirical formula for parameter n there are a total of six indicators for the climate and vegetation seasonality thus it is difficult to develop a simple equation to link the seasonality indicators and parameter n this study tries to develop a formula in each catchment by using the multiple regression method before conducting the multiple regression the relationships among parameter n and the six indicators are investigated fig 5 results show that in most of the catchments there is at least one seasonality indicator that is highly and linearly correlated to the parameter n the mean maximum correlation over all the catchments the mean of the maximum correlation between parameter n and the six indicators is 0 61 0 22 on the other hand results also show that the correlations between parameter n and the seasonality indicators in all the catchments are highly correlated to each other fig 5 these suggest that the cs and vs indicators are linearly related to the parameter n according to these a multiple linear formula is developed to link the parameter n and the cs and vs indicators 6 n a α cs b β cs c γ cs d α vs e β vs f γ vs where a b c d e and f are the regression coefficients α cs β cs and γ cs are the cs indicators and α vs β vs and γ vs are the vs indicators 2 5 responses of parameter n to the cs and vs the effects of cs and vs changes on parameter n is evaluated by using a scenario analysis approach according to eq 6 two scenarios are designed of which one is designed for reflecting the impacts of cs changes n cs resulting from climate seasonality and another one is used to represent the impacts of vs changes n vs resulting from vegetation seasonality the parameter n under these two scenarios are calculated as 7a n csi a α csi b β csi c γ csi d α v s 1 e β v s 1 f γ v s 1 7b n vsi a α c s 1 b β c s 1 c γ c s 1 d α vsi e β vsi f γ vsi where n csi and n vsi are the n cs and n vs in win i and α csi β csi γ csi are the α cs β cs γ cs in win i and similarly the α vsi β vsi γ vsi are the α vs β vs γ vs in win i and the α c s 1 β c s 1 γ c s 1 α v s 1 β v s 1 γ v s 1 are the α cs β cs γ cs α vs β vs γ vs in the first window win 1 respectively then the trends in n csi denoted as t r e n d n cs and n vsi denoted as t r e n d n vs are detected using the modified pre whitening mann kendall trend test kendall 1975 mann 1945 yue and wang 2002 and the magnitude of each trend is estimated by using the sen s slope burn and elnur 2002 as presented above the t r e n d n cs means the trend in parameter n caused by cs changes and t r e n d n vs means the trend in parameter n caused by vs changes to quantify the relative contributions of cs and vs changes to parameter n the absolute mean contribution is employed 8a c o n n cs t r e n d n cs t r e n d n cs t r e n d n vs 100 8b c o n n vs t r e n d n vs t r e n d n cs t r e n d n vs 100 where c o n n cs is the relative contribution of cs changes and c o n n vs is the relative contribution of vs changes to the changes in parameter n 2 6 relative contributions of cs and vs in water partitioning because that the et 0 and p are coupled together and their relationship are not clear it is not suitable to derive the sensitivity or elasticity formulas for runoff or evapotranspiration using partial differential which is based on the assumption that et 0 p and n are independent of each other this study develops a scenario analysis approach within which a total of five scenarios were designed table 1 to separate the contribution of each contributor the trends in the modeled et under different scenarios are detected using the mann kendall trend test and are demoted as t r e n d e cs t r e n d e vs t r e n d e csvs t r e n d e cc and t r e n d e all respectively table 1 the performance of the scenarios analysis approach is validated by comparing the t r e n d e all trend in et derived using the scenario approach to the observed trends in et derived based on water balance p q based on these the t r e n d e cs t r e n d e vs t r e n d e csvs t r e n d e cc and t r e n d e all are compared to each other for investigating the contribution of changes in p and et 0 cs and vs to water partitioning because that the signs of t r e n d e cs t r e n d e vs t r e n d e csvs and t r e n d e cc would be negative or positive the relative contributions of different factors are quantified based on their absolute values in particular the relative contribution of t r e n d e cs t r e n d e vs t r e n d e csvs and t r e n d e cc to et are calculated as 9a concs t r e n d e cs t r e n d e cs t r e n d e vs t r e n d e cc 100 9b convs t r e n d e vs t r e n d e cs t r e n d e vs t r e n d e cc 100 9c concc t r e n d e cc t r e n d e cs t r e n d e vs t r e n d e cc 100 9d concsvs 1 t r e n d e cc t r e n d e cs t r e n d e vs t r e n d e cc 100 where concs convs concc and concsvs represents the relative contribution resulting from changes in cs changes in vs changes in p and et0 and changes in both cs and vs respectively these relative contributions are calculated and compared under different moving widows 5 year 10 year to quantify the uncertainties resulting from the moving window approach 3 results 3 1 performance of the predicting model for parameter n the determination coefficient r 2 for eq 6 ranges from 0 37 to 0 99 with a mean of 0 81 0 05 fig 6 particularly the r 2 in 33 5 17 6 of the catchments are higher than 0 90 and 62 2 16 5 80 0 9 9 and 94 0 5 3 of the catchments have r 2 0 80 r 2 0 70 and r 2 0 50 respectively fig 7 shows three examples of the performance of eq 6 in predicting parameter n clearly the regression coefficients between the modeled n derived based on eq 6 and observed n derived based on eq 1 using p q and et 0 are near 1 0 fig 7 these indicate that the eq 6 works well in modeling parameter n by using the seasonality indicators 3 2 temporal patterns in parameter n and its components of these catchments 51 4 3 5 show positive t r e n d n trend in parameter n fig 8 a 42 3 0 9 and 56 0 4 6 exhibit positive t r e n d n cs trends in parameter n resulting from cs changes and t r e n d n vs trends in parameter n resulting from vs changes fig 8 b c overall the mean relative contributions of cs and vs to parameter n are 53 6 2 7 and 46 4 2 7 eq 8a and eq 8b respectively it is important to note that there is no significant relationship between t r e n d n d v i trend in ndvi and t r e n d n vs and between t r e n d p et 0 trend in p et 0 and t r e n d n cs data not shown here however significant relationship between annual mean ndvi and parameter n e g n 0 1 e 0 5 n d v i r 2 0 75 p 0 05 can be found in the 13 catchments on the loess plateau where large scale ecological restoration has been implemented during the past decades liang et al 2015 ning et al 2017 3 3 contribution of climate and vegetation variability to et and the uncertainties regardless of the time scales of the moving windows 5 year 10 year the t r e n d e all trend in et derived using the scenario analysis approach and observed trend in et derived using water balance et p q are very close to each other fig 9 a the mean determination r 2 and regression coefficient the slope of the regression model linking t r e n d e all and the observed trend in et are 0 94 0 04 and 1 04 0 03 respectively these results demonstrate that the scenario analysis approach is effective and reliable on the other hand the t r e n d e all t r e n d e cc trend in et resulting from changes in p and et 0 t r e n d e csvs trend in et resulting from cs and vs changes t r e n d e cs trend in et resulted by cs changes and t r e n d e vs trend in et resulted by vs changes derived based on different moving windows are highly and linearly correlated to each other fig 9 b c d e for example the determination coefficient and regression coefficient between the t r e n d e all derived using 5 year and 6 year moving windows are 0 97 and 1 02 fig 9 b and those between the t r e n d e csvs derived using 5 year and 6 year moving windows are 0 96 and 1 04 fig 9 c these suggest that the results derived from different moving windows are robust based on these methods results show that that of all the catchments 51 2 2 7 51 6 1 4 52 3 3 3 42 1 1 5 and 57 0 4 4 of the catchments exhibit positive t r e n d e all t r e n d e cc t r e n d e c s v s t r e n d e cs and t r e n d e vs respectively fig 10 more importantly 61 0 3 0 of the catchments exhibit higher concsvs contribution of cs and vs eq 9d than concc contribution of changes in p and et 0 eq 9c and 44 2 5 3 have higher convs contribution of vs eq 9a than the concs contribution of cs eq 9b overall the mean concc concsvs concs and convs are 42 9 2 3 57 1 2 3 32 2 2 3 and 24 9 0 3 respectively fig 9 f 4 discussion this study develops a simple water deficit item p et 0 and employs the three parameter log logistic distribution which can fit the probability of p et 0 and ndvi well the correlation are higher than 0 95 fig 3 to quantify the probability distribution of p et 0 and ndvi for representing their seasonality based on these the parameters of the three parameter log logistic distribution namely the α β and γ are used as the seasonality indicators as these three parameters can reproduce the probability distribution of the p et 0 or ndvi fig 4 the high determination coefficient r 2 of the multiple linear regression in most of the catchments mean r 2 of 0 81 0 05 fig 6 demonstrate that this method can predict parameter n well fig 7 meanwhile the high determination coefficient r 2 0 94 0 04 p 0 05 and the regression coefficient 1 04 0 03 between the modeled using the scenario analysis approach and observed trends in et derived based on water balance et p q fig 9 a illustrate the effectiveness and reliability of the methods used for separating the contribution of varying contributors to the changes in et in statistics the determination coefficient r 2 generally indicates the proportion of the variance of the dependent variable here the parameter n that can be predicted from the independent variables cs and vs indicators in this case gujarati and porter 2009 therefore the high r 2 also implies that cs and vs jointly control the variance in parameter n regardless of the location hydrogeology basis climate types of the catchment averagely the vs mean relative contribution of 53 6 2 7 plays a similar role in controlling the parameter n as the cs does mean relative contribution of 46 4 2 7 these are in good agreement with the findings presented in liu et al 2018a which pointed out that vegetation dynamics and climate seasonality can explain 67 and 46 of the variance of parameter n in the 26 global large catchments by using a quite different method in the same catchments the results in this study are 52 2 3 4 and 47 8 3 4 meanwhile in accordance with many previous studies liu et al 2016 padrón et al 2017 yang et al 2014a no significant correlation between parameter n and mean ndvi and mean p et 0 can be found in most of the catchments the explanation is that the mean ndvi and p et 0 miss the seasonality information seasonal variation of climate and vegetation respectively however in some catchments with dramatic vegetation changes vegetation dynamics control the variance in parameter n zhang et al 2018 for example in the 13 catchments on the loess plateau where a large scale green for grain has been implemented liu et al 2018b the parameter n is highly related to the annual mean ndvi e g n 0 1 e 0 5 n d v i r 2 0 75 p 0 05 since the cs and vs jointly control the changes in parameter n they affect water partitioning significantly fig 9 10 overall the cs and vs mean relative contribution of 57 1 2 3 averagely play more important roles in water partitioning than the changes in p and et 0 mean relative contribution of 42 9 2 3 fig 9 f moreover the cs mean relative contribution of 32 2 2 3 contributes slightly higher than the vs mean relative contribution of 24 9 0 3 fig 9 f these results demonstrate that both the cs and vs are critical factors affecting water balance these findings are in line with those in ning et al 2017 which pointed out that the contributions of climate seasonality to et ranges from 0 1 to 74 8 in the 13 catchments on the loess plateau in the same catchments the values in this study are in the range from 4 4 3 8 to 79 0 9 6 the differences may be resulted from that the model used in ning et al 2017 is based on annual mean ndvi which miss the seasonal information of vegetation besides the advantages of this study several limitations and uncertainties should be noted first the empirical parameter n predicting model is based on multiple linear regression the six vs and cs indicators make it difficult to develop a physical model for parameter n to address this issue this study develops a multiple linear regression model to link the parameter n and the indicators based on the facts that in each catchment there is at least one seasonality indicator being highly and linearly correlated to the parameter n thus though the regression model works well in predicting parameter n it is still lack of physical basis because the climate and vegetation seasonality may interact nonlinearly in the budyko framework second this study employs a relative long term e g 5 year 10 year overlapping moving window approach to minimize the impacts of ignoring the changes in water storage though the changes in water storage have been demonstrated to be small compared to other hydrological components e g p and et 0 at a relative long term time scale it can still affect the parameter n and consequently the final results third the climate and vegetation seasonality are associated closely with each other in other words vegetation seasonality would not be strictly independent from climate seasonality as vegetation growth is highly affected by the climate conditions therefore the methods presented above cannot strictly separate the relative contributions of vs and cs to et forth human activities such as water resources regulation water conservancy projects construction and irrigation can have more or less impacts on water partitioning however these factors have not been considered in the model though vegetation dynamics can reflect some aspects of them therefore more work is still needed in future nevertheless this study proposes an effective method for introducing the cs and vs to the budyko framework and reveals that the joint contribution of cs and vs in water balance are even more important than the changes in p and et 0 and demonstrates that the vs and cs are as important as each other in water partitioning these findings would be helpful for many eco hydrology related fields such as water resources management eco hydrological modelling and assessing the changes in water resources in future 5 conclusion this study develops a new method to introduce the climate seasonality cs and vegetation seasonality vs into the budyko framework particularly the scale α shape β and origin γ parameter of the three parameter log logistic distribution which fitting the monthly p et 0 and normalized difference vegetation index ndvi are used as the cs and vs indicators and the multiple linear regression is employed to link the parameter n and seasonality indicators then this method is validated and applied in global catchments to revisit the relationships among water partitioning climate and vegetation changes results show that this method can predict parameter n well r 2 0 81 0 05 over global catchments besides these the high determination coefficients of the empirical model also indicate that cs and vs jointly control the variance in parameter n moreover the joint contribution of cs and vs to et mean relative contribution of 57 1 2 3 is slightly higher than the changes in p and et 0 mean relative contribution of 42 9 2 3 and the roles played by the cs mean absolute contribution of 32 2 2 3 are slightly more important than the vs mean relative contribution of 24 9 0 3 these results indicate that both the vs and cs are two critical factors of water partitioning these findings would be valuable and helpful for water resources management and assessing the responses of water resources to the changing environment credit authorship contribution statement meixian liu conceptualization methodology software data curation formal analysis investigation validation

3757,a quantitative understanding of riverine phosphorus p export in response to shifts in anthropogenic inputs terrestrial retention and climate is important for developing mitigation measures at a watershed scale in this study we simulated a decadal change in the riverine p export in a human dominated watershed from a cold climatic region located in northeast asia a process based catchment model nested within a delicate land p module was applied to simulate the dynamics of p retentions and its exports in the watershed we found that the terrestrial p retention capacities declined for 2008 2017 and the decline rates would accelerate under three representative concentration pathways i e rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the p released from the diffused source and historical legacy could partly offset the effort through point source p reduction by the improved wastewater treatments climate changes e g duration and frequency of extreme rainfall event could accelerate p deliveries from the p legacy retained in soils we suggest that a long term watershed p management strategy should be targeted to reduce historical p legacy input into river rather than solely focusing on the short

anthropogenic activities have substantially altered phosphorus p cycling on the lands elser and bennett 2011 powers et al 2016 tong et al 2017a agricultural p fertilizer application domestic

immobile after being adsorbed by al fe or ca grenon et al 2021 land p retention may regulate its delivery rate into water and creates time lags between the human p input and its concentration in water

would act as a chronic source for the downstream regions even after the p inputs are reduced haygarth et al 2014 macintosh et al 2018 withers et al 2017 however once the accumulated p exceeds the soil

result in an increase of up to 30 in the p loadings into lake simcoe which offset the p reduced through improved agricultural practices bosch et al 2014 revealed that with climate change there would be a 17 increase in the runoff and a 23 increase in nutrient yield in the lake erie basin in the usa to the best of our knowledge a detailed description of the processes related to the anthropogenic p inputs into the watershed terrestrial p retentions and climate changes from a holistic perspective is lacking we attempted to explore their dynamics using a process based catchment p model with a delicate soil module in this study a human dominated watershed in a cold climatic region in northeast asia is illustrated from a methodological viewpoint this application attempted a potential solution to simulate the dynamics of soil p retentions and riverine export using a process based catchment model from a water management perspective we suggest that a long term watershed p management plan should be targeted for reducing the historical p legacy inputs into the rivers rather than solely focusing on short term changes in river p concentrations and loading 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and riverine p monitoring the songhua river sr is one of the largest rivers in northeast asia with a length of 1 927 km and a streamflow of 7 6 1010 m3 per year wang et al 2015 the catchment of the songhua river basin srb e 119 52 132 31 n 41 42 51 38 fig 1 has an area of 5 6 105 km2 and a population of approximately 54 million williams et al 2015 it is a foothills fed river and the catchment receives water mainly from summer monsoon with a certain amount of snowfall in the high elevation streams li et al 2014 the watershed has a large difference in the topography and is surrounded by the highly elevated mountain regions above 1000 m fig s1 the main stream is divided into three sections an upper section from the head stream to songyuan a middle section from the songyuan to tonghe and a lower section from tonghe to tongjiang fig 1 the major tributaries include the nenjiang mudan hulan lalin and mayi rivers fig s1 according to the locations of the tributaries and the elevations of the basin a total of 10 sub basins were delineated ranging from forests to crop lands and including cities such as harbin and jilin figs s1 s2 and table s3 srb has varied climatology mainly due to differences in topography the monthly mean air temperature in the basin ranged from 17 6 c january to 20 6 c july with an annual average of 3 1 c fig s3 the annual average rainfall was 438 642 mm for 2008 2017 with the maximum in july 129 mm and the minimum in january only 4 9 mm an average of 110 rain days occurs in one year fig s3 since the 1960 s the air temperature

receives nutrients via the point e g wastewater effluent discharge and the diffuse sources e g land runoff tong et al 2017b a monitoring program was initiated in 2006 to identify the dynamics of riverine p loadings across the srb due to the high costs associated with the sampling and nutrient analysis long term and consistent water quality monitoring is rare in large rivers rowe et al 2013 sprague et al 2017 a total of 10 sites were monitored in the upper middle and lower streams 1 site each and major tributaries 7 sites monthly in the 2008 2017 fig 1 and their results are summarised in table 1 these monitoring sites were generally set at the outlet for each sub basin to incorporate the overall impacts of anthropogenic p inputs into the basins the procedure for water monitoring remained consistent during the study period which was based on the technical specification requirement for the monitoring of surface waters in china the sampling was usually conducted during the early days of the month an unfiltered surface water sample 1 l was collected from the middle stream of the channels because of the difficulties in p species analysis for such a long period only tp the sum of dissolved and particulate p was determined using the persulfate digestion automated colorimetric analysis with a method detection limit mdl of 10 μg l 1 in the subsequent data analysis all tp values lower than the mdl were set to 1 2 of the mdl 2 2 modelling soil p delivery and retention in the watershed in this study a process based catchment p model inca p nested within a delicate soil module was explored to model the soil p retentions and estimate p loadings from human inputs to river jackson blake et al 2016 inca is a semi distributed process based model that uses a mass balance approach to track flow and nutrient pathways in both terrestrial and aquatic compartment the model is based on a series of first order chemical equations that are solved by using the runge kutta method original version was developed by wade et al 2002 and it was modified by incorporating sediment erosions and the delivery process and modelling dissolved and particulate p separately instead of simulating bulk p jackson blake et al 2016 lazar et al 2010 different land use types were identified for each sub basin and all the land based processes i e p input storage and output were calculated based on the 1 1 km grids for each type at sub basin levels and then scaled up to the actual areas jackson blake et al 2016 inca p is capable of revealing the dynamic p delivery processes in soils e g

that is designed primarily for usages with the inca model a summary of the major input parameters of the model is provided in table s1 a detailed sensitivity analysis of the model can be found in pathak et al 2018 and wade et al 2002 in the modelling soil p pool is divided into anthropogenic p inputs e g fertilisers crop residue and historical storages fig 2 based on their bioavailability to crops three p forms were assumed to exist in soil inactive labile and bio available goyette et al 2018 grenon et al 2021 sattari et al 2012 labile p can exchange with the bio available p through desorption and sorption the exchanges between inactive and labile p can occur through immobilisation and weathering jackson blake et al 2016 p flow pathways into rivers include direct runoff soil waters and groundwater fig 2 a summary of the dynamic p exchanges among the three forms could be described as follows 1 dp t dt p lin dp s dt p up p t v s q s 2 dp l dt p sin dp s dt c w c t p i m l p

weathering and temperature factors m l refers to the reach sediment inputs per unit area and c i refers to the chemical immobilisation factor detailed descriptions of these processes and associated parameters were provided by jackson blake et al 2016 in this study difference between diffused source p input crop p uptake and soil output was used to estimate the p retention in land as follows 4 f

cropping livestock operation municipal rural wastewater and aquaculture which are believed to be the dominant p sources liu et al 2016 tong et al 2020 this dataset was a part of our national data set calculated by the hierarchical national p cycling model which was applied to evaluate the impact of human p inputs on water tp concentrations tong et al 2017b tong et al 2020 to address spatial variations of human activities in the basin a raster dataset based on gridded population densities li et al 2019 livestock potter et al 2010 and land use types liu et al 2014 was developed the output was a high resolution map at a resolution of 1 1 km of anthropogenic p inputs with the five major sources for each year from 2008 to 2017 fig s4 and dataset s1 p output through crop harvests in the watershed was also estimated based on regional statistics and re distributed into 1 1 km grids according to the distribution of crop land 2 3 climate change scenario and modelling evaluation hydrological processes on land are largely controlled by climates which impact the soil p deliveries into the streams dudula and randhir 2016 mukundan et al 2020 to evaluate potential impacts climate projections by miroc5 based on the cmip5 global climate model forster et al 2013 were introduced into the model miroc5 was selected because of its good performance against historical air temperatures and rainfall records in the east asia chen et al 2021 fu et al 2020 we followed the previous studies to select the typical climate change projections jia et al 2021a jia et al 2021b fan and bai 2021 three representative concentration pathways i e rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 had been selected to represent future ghg emission scenarios rcp2 6 scenario is a peak scenario indicating that the radiative forcing level would reach 3 1 w m2 by the mid century but would return to 2 6 w m2 by 2100 rcp4 5 is the ghgs control strategy that is required to meet the 2 0 c aspiration that is set under the paris accord rcp8 5 is a business as usual scenario in which the ghg emissions continue to increase throughout the 21st century daily air temperature and rainfall data under the three rcp scenarios were extracted from specific grids in the watershed the extracted data was used to compare with the historical records and data from 2020 to 2050 was applied for the future simulations in the scenario analysis of the future p reductions and climate changes we first assumed that human p inputs i e point and diffuse source inputs fig 2 in the srb remained at the same level as that in 2017 and simulated the p input into the river from the soil in 2020 2050 with the results in fig 6 three climatic scenarios rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 were introduced to simulate the impacts of the climate changes second we have set up two p reduction scenarios e g 10 20 and 30 reduction in point or diffuse source inputs relative to the 2017 and simulate their responses in future riverine p loadings point source reduction refers to reduction on municipal wastewater input while the diffuse source refers to fertilizer use livestock farming and rural wastewater we assume a reduction 10 20 and 30 respectively for all the diffuse sources regardless of the types in this study 2006 and 2007 were considered as a warming up period to eliminate the initial biases such as initial quick flows initial soil water flow etc in modelling the monthly monitoring data obtained from water sampling sites and hydrological stations in the srb were applied for calibration and validation the models were calibrated by adjusting the inca p model parameters such as flow velocity and soil p process parameters to fit the flow and water quality records for the time period from 2008 to 2012 the major parameters potentially impacting the modelling performance has been summarized by the previous studies whitehead et al 2019 the model was subsequently validated for the time period of 2013 2017 the performance on the hydrodynamics was examined by stream flow rates in the mainstreams and tributaries fig s5 the performance in predicting the riverine p was examined by the tp monitoring results and riverine p loadings see the section of results figs s6 s7 due to the lack of data on water p species only tp concentration was used for applied the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and pearson correlation coefficients r between the simulated and monitoring results were calculated ervinia et al 2020 wu et al 2017 the river flow data was obtained from hydrological stations at the outlet of the sub watershed the monthly tp concentrations were obtained from the decadal river p monitoring project the riverine p export was calculated based on the measured river flow rate and p concentration initial soil p storage including the labile and inactive p in each sub basin was obtained from the china soil database shangguan et al 2013 fig s8 in general the initial soil inactive p in the basin ranged from 150 to 2085 mg kg but fluctuated in different land use types e g 736 mg kg in crop land and 985 mg kg in forest initial soil labile p contents ranged from 5 7 to 88 7 mg kg daily temperatures and rainfall data for 2008 2017 were used to simulate the hydrological process that was obtained from the weather stations in the basin http data cma cn spatial distribution data on the land use types soil property elevation and population density in the basin were provided by resources and environment science and data center china 3 results 3 1 temporal trend in the river p concentration and loading based on the monitoring data set of 2008 2017 we found that the tp concentration in the main streams of the sr and its tributaries remained relatively high summarized in table 1 in general a water tp concentration of 76 μg l 1 or higher could suggest a highly productive or eutrophic river system dodds et al 1998 stackpoole et al 2019 in 2017 the annual average tp concentrations in the upper middle and lower streams of river were 123 0 22 1 101 4 36 6 and 86 9 16 5 μg l 1 respectively which were all higher than the threshold large variations in tp concentrations were observed among the different tributaries table 1 the lowest tp was observed in the nenjiang river with the annual average of 65 1 27 3 μg l 1 whereas the highest tp value was observed in the woken river with an annual average of 166 2 68 1 μg l 1 a clear distinction was observed regarding the seasonality of tp concentrations with higher tp occurring in the wet season and lower tp in the dry season fig s9 an overall decline in the river tp concentrations was observed in the main streams at a rate of 0 3 0 9 μg l per month p 0 01 fig 3 and some tributaries fig s6 however rare changes were observed in riverine p export from 2008 to 2017 p 0 05 fig 3 in 2017 the annual tp export from the sr was approximately 6 600 mg at a rate of 13 2 kg km 2 among all the tributaries the nenjiang river contributed the largest p input into the main stream with an annual input of 1 250 mg accounting for 19 40 of the lower stream p export fig 4 a and table s3 tp loadings into the main stream from other tributaries were relatively small e g 113 mg by the woken river and 170 mg by the mayi river a strong seasonal variation in riverine p export was observed with the p loadings in summer 3 500 mg and autumn 1 400 mg occupying about 74 of the annual export fig 4b 3 2 inca p modelling results and the performance evaluation fig 3 also shows comparisons between the observed and simulated stream flows tp concentration and river p loading for the entire study period model performance was evaluated using r and nse an nse of 1 corresponds to a perfect match between the modelled and the observed data an nse of 0 indicates that the model prediction is as accurate as the average of the observed data in general the model showed good agreements between the observed and modelled flow tp concentration and p loading at all the sites in the main stream fig 3 with the r values ranging between 0 78 and 0 96 0 65 0 82 and 0 81 0 94 and nse values between 0 53 and 0 79 0 02 0 58 and 0 51 0 72 for the river flow tp concentration and river tp loadings respectively for the tributaries the nse values ranged from 0 11 to 0 87 for river flows from 0 01 to 0 49 for tp concentrations and from 0 22 to 0 83 for river p loadings figs s5 s7 in particular the model successfully depicted the decadal trends and seasonal changes e g the flooding and dry seasons of river flows and river p exports during the study period fig 3b and s7 3 3 anthropogenic p input and the land retention in contrast to the insignificant changes in river p export in the watershed fig 3 we found that the reductions in anthropogenic p input in the basin dataset s1 did not result in a decrease in the riverine p export an overall decline was observed in human p inputs into srb in 2008 2017 from 1 6 105 mg in 2008 to 1 3 105 mg in 2017 substantial p reduction was observed in the point source input from 4 450 mg in 2008 to 1 754 mg in 2017 this reduction was mainly achieved by the rapid construction of wwtps in the watershed where the number of operational wwtps increased from 71 in 2008 to 214 in 2017 in 2017 over 90 of the local wastewater discharge was treated before the discharge the relative impacts of diffuse and point source on receiving water were different as diffused source p input is retained in land before reaching the stream chen et al 2015 land retention defined as the fraction of diffused source p input retained in land could regulate the rates of p delivery into surface water thereby influencing the relative p contribution from diffused sources into rivers goyette et al 2018 powers et al 2016 stackpoole et al 2019 the modelling results indicated that the p input from the diffused sources and historical storage became increasingly dominant over time figs 5 and s10 from 2008 to 2017 the annual p inputs into the rivers from diffused sources increased from 7 600 to 8 900 mg in the entire srb at a rate of 133 8 mg year 1 with decrease in point source p input the fraction of point source input in total river p loadings declined from approximately 38 8 10 7 in 2008 to only 18 9 7 7 in 2017 fig 5 we found that the watershed had a strong capacity to retain p in the lands in 2017 the land retained approximately 93 6 1 6 of the diffused source p inputs see figure s10 the entire watershed retained approximately 189 kg p km 2 from the diffused source input in 2017 and 2 600 kg p km 2 was retained in the srb during the study period in particular our modelling has also indicated that the p retention capacity across the srb showed slow but substantial decrease during 2008 2017 fig s10 3 4 response in the land p retention under climate change scenarios under the climate change scenarios rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 air temperature and rainfall in the watershed is expected to change significantly significant increases in daily surface air temperature and rainfall can occur during 2020 2050 fig s11 with an annual increase of 0 01 0 04 c in air temperatures and an annual increase of 5 96 7 86 mm in the rainfall for three rcp scenarios occurrences of heavy rainfall events 25 mm in one day would be more frequent under all three climate change scenarios from 1 to 5 days per year for 2020 2030 to 4 9 days per year for 2040 2050 consequently annual river flows of the sr would increase by 8 15 relative to 2020 from 563 108 m3 in 2017 to 1 232 1 359 108 m3 during 2040 2050 table 2 we simulated the impacts of climate change on land p export to river and found that under the climate change scenarios p inputs from diffused sources and historical storage to river can increase substantially for 2020 2050 fig s12 even if anthropogenic p input in the srb remained at the same levels as those in 2017 the p contributions into rivers from the land could increase from 13 3 kg km 2 in 2017 to 22 6 25 8 kg km 2 in 2040 2050 4 discussion 4 1 a summary about soil p retention in the watershed p retained in soils forming a legacy is an underestimated pool that determines p exports to the downstream waterbodies hu et al 2020 powers et al 2016 sharpley et al 2013 stackpoole et al 2019 however it is difficult to be estimated accurately because of complicated soil p mechanism soil p retention could reduce the discharge into rivers and lakes in the short term while in the long term the accumulated p over time can act as a chronic p source even after the external input is reduced macintosh et al 2018 withers et al 2017 in general the p retention fraction of the diffused source input in the basin was to the value estimated by the global news model in this basin approximately 90 95 tysmans et al 2013 this fraction was higher than those in the yangtze river basin 40 50 liu et al 2018b and ganges river basin only 3 tysmans et al 2013 and was approaching to those in the lake erie basin 90 the lake michigan basin 95 and the mississippi river basin 91 han et al 2011 this indicates that a large fraction of the diffused source p inputs is the part of the historical p legacy the capacity to retain p in the land is supposed to be finite with a threshold beyond which riverine p export could increase substantially goyette et al 2018 in a survey targeting 23 watersheds in north america researchers have suggested a low threshold of 2 1 t p km 2 beyond this further p inputs into watersheds could cause a significant acceleration of p losses with runoff goyette et al 2018 in several regions e g east asia and north america historical agricultural p usage has been substantially greater than the actual needs of the crops macdonald et al 2011 thus a large amount of p originating from the historical p inputs has accumulated in the soils over time grenon et al 2021 macintosh et al 2018 soil p retentions would explain the differences in the responses of riverine p exports to anthropogenic p inputs into the watershed chen et al 2015 jarvie et al 2013 kusmer et al 2019 in general the human dominated basins may undergo a prolonged but finite accumulation period when p input exceeds the agricultural need the accumulated p could continue to mobilise long after the p inputs are reduced powers et al 2016 however different basins could have varying responses to anthropogenic p inputs depending on factors such as climatic conditions historical storage and soil properties hu et al 2020 kusmer et al 2019 4 2 watershed p management under climate change scenarios climatic factors have important implications for terrestrial p retentions chen et al 2015 fischer et al 2021 goyette et al 2016 a previous study observed a positive relationship between rainfall drainage outflow and increased p loading in the runoffs williams et al 2015 in a recent study in the western lake erie basin in the usa it was proposed that climate change would result in less nutrient runoff due to increased evaporation and decreased snowfall in spite of the increases in the overall amounts of precipitation kalcic et al 2019 however some other researchers hold the view that with the climate changes riverine p export would be enhanced largely due to the more frequent extreme rainfall events as indicated in agricultural regions in the midwestern region of the usa carpenter et al 2018 and three diverse agricultural catchments in the uk ockenden et al 2016 they further concluded that the impacts of climate changes would mainly occur in winter with an increase of up to 30 in the p loading by 2050 to mitigate these impacts a 20 80 reduction in the agricultural p inputs is required ockenden et al 2017 in the srb hydrological characteristics may change substantially in the future with climate change summarised in table 2 we simulated two p input reduction scenarios point and diffused source reductions under rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 for 2020 2050 we found that in the future compared with the no reduction scenarios fig 6 reductions of diffused source p inputs could have a greater effect on reducing the riverine p exports than the point source reduction with a 50 reduction in diffused source input riverine p exports may decrease from 10 564 641 mg in the scenarios without p reductions to 8 872 641 mg under the three climate scenarios for 2040 2050 with a 50 reduction in point source p input there would be a limited reduction in the riverine p loading for 2040 2050 fig 7 4 3 mitigation in agricultural practices in the watershed potential challenges revealed in the srb could be present in many other watersheds globally ockenden et al 2017 considering increasing contributions from diffused sources and historical p legacy the mitigation in the agricultural practices is required to reduce soil p loss under climate change scenarios arneth et al 2019 we suggest that three strategies should be considered in the future watershed p management first the historical p store should be taken into account and the p fertilizer usage should be reduced in fact after a long history of p fertilizer applications an increase in surface soil p content has occurred in many regions ma et al 2019 for agricultural systems located in europe and canada a reduction in the p fertilizer usage has been shown to have very few negative impacts on crop yield bast et al 2009 mogollón et al 2021 sattari et al 2012 however it would take a long period for recovery to the critical legacy p stock levels in the catchment chen et al 2019 for the regions e g usa and europe with substantial p legacies due to the extensive p fertiliser usages during 1970 2000 soil p legacies would allow crop productions without new p additions for approximately six decades mogollón et al 2021 sharpley et al 2013 second soil erosion should be alleviated by changing land use e g afforestation and reforestation of cultivated land the majority of soil p loss through runoff has been in the form of particulates chen et al 2015 since the 1950s due to the intensified farming in the srb the depth of the organic soil layers has decreased from 60 to 70 cm in the original cultivation period to only 20 30 cm fang and sun 2017 increased soil erosions can intensify the riverine p exports alewell et al 2020 thus soil conservations and the controls of sediment delivery into waters are beneficial e g reducing tillage intensity and construction of gully control shao et al 2021 yan et al 2018 third mineral fertilisers have been used to intensify terrestrial p retentions compared with the other watersheds many regions in the srb have relatively high soil organic contents which provide the releases of a large pool of p over time soluble phosphate available for crop uptake could form the inactive ionic complexes with the al and fe as well as the precipitation with ca grenon et al 2021 thus the application of mineral fertilisers could introduce ca or fe to these fields grenon et al 2021 organic soils with the greater fe and al stocks could show a higher retention of p in the lands larsen et al 1958 however this practice would not mitigate the soil p legacy issues but only reduce the delivery rates into the rivers 4 4 uncertainty in modelling and limitations there are always issues related to model uncertainties and model limitations in any flows and water quality modelling studies choa et al 2020 jia et al 2021a jia et al 2021b the fact that the system is dynamic and that the chemical processes are kinetic in nature and interact with the hydrology makes the modelling a complex process to the best of our knowledge this study is one of the few attempts to apply a process based model to simulate land p retention a similar but simpler case could be found in sattari et al s 2012 study which applied a two pool soil p model to depict the soil p residues this study has some limitations first unlike the traditional methods to model the soil p retention a process based model was developed inca p has progressed significantly in the soil p modules but soil p dynamic processes are still simple for example the roles of carbon and the other nutrients in the biological p uptakes mineralisation and immobilisation rates were not included second long term water monitoring data with the high frequency e g daily or even hourly particularly under high flow conditions are essential for validating the model however in this study only monthly monitoring data were used to validate the modelling result third future water monitoring should also include the other p species such as total dissolved and particulate p in addition to tp most of the p in the streams exists in the form of particulate p while dissolved p is more bioavailable future monitoring should reflect potential impacts of different p species in rivers 5 conclusions in summary this study applied a process based catchment p model with a delicate soil module to characterise the nexuses among p inputs from human activities land p retention and climate change we proposed that the increasing p contributions from diffused sources or historical legacy counteracted p reductions by improved sanitation in the srb under climate change scenarios p input into rivers from diffused sources and historical legacy would increase substantially which could constitute a challenge for water quality improvement we suggest that a long term perspective of watershed control strategy should target the controls and reduction of p inputs from the historical legacy rather than solely focusing on short term changes in riverine p concentrations and loadings credit authorship contribution

3757,a quantitative understanding of riverine phosphorus p export in response to shifts in anthropogenic inputs terrestrial retention and climate is important for developing mitigation measures at a watershed scale in this study we simulated a decadal change in the riverine p export in a human dominated watershed from a cold climatic region located in northeast asia a process based catchment model nested within a delicate land p module was applied to simulate the dynamics of p retentions and its exports in the watershed we found that the terrestrial p retention capacities declined for 2008 2017 and the decline rates would accelerate under three representative concentration pathways i e rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the p released from the diffused source and historical legacy could partly offset the effort through point source p reduction by the improved wastewater treatments climate changes e g duration and frequency of extreme rainfall event could accelerate p deliveries from the p legacy retained in soils we suggest that a long term watershed p management strategy should be targeted to reduce historical p legacy input into river rather than solely focusing on the short term changes in the riverine p concentration keywords anthropogenic p input terrestrial retention process based catchment model river p loading climate change cold climate regions 1 introduction anthropogenic activities have substantially altered phosphorus p cycling on the lands elser and bennett 2011 powers et al 2016 tong et al 2017a agricultural p fertilizer application domestic wastewater discharge and the other human activities have released substantial p amounts into the watershed which subsequently aggravate p loadings into river and lake bussi et al 2016 liu et al 2018a tong et al 2017b of late freshwater systems are constantly under stressors of changing nutrient cycles best 2019 the increasing riverine p loading due to anthropogenic inputs has gained wide attention globally han et al 2011 hu et al 2020 tong et al 2017b zhang et al 2017 in the stream a total p tp of 76 μg l 1 or above could represent a highly productive status dodds et al 1998 stackpoole et al 2019 has investigated 173 watersheds in the united states of america usa and found that over half of them had tp concentration exceeding this threshold during 2000 2014 a continental scale increase in the stream p was observed in relatively undisturbed catchment in the usa and the underlying mechanism has not been clearly understood stoddard et al 2016 high p levels could result in the deterioration of water quality by eutrophication algal blooms coastal hypoxia and dead zones breitburg et al 2018 damania et al 2019 griffith and gobler 2020 understanding the long term dynamics of p input and output balance at a watershed scale is an essential step in regulating the human activity and improving water quality stoddard et al 2016 chen et al 2018 goyette et al 2018 increasing evidence has suggested that watershed has capacity to modulate downstream p exports by retaining the excess p on lands gomez velez et al 2015 powers et al 2016 as a lithophile element p is relatively immobile after being adsorbed by al fe or ca grenon et al 2021 land p retention may regulate its delivery rate into water and creates time lags between the human p input and its concentration in water kusmer et al 2019 in the short term p retention may reduce its input into rivers and lakes goyette et al 2018 in the long term p accumulated in the soil over time could create a large p legacy that would act as a chronic source for the downstream regions even after the p inputs are reduced haygarth et al 2014 macintosh et al 2018 withers et al 2017 however once the accumulated p exceeds the soil storage capacities the soil to water transport would accelerate substantially as revealed in a study in north america goyette et al 2018 simulating dynamics of soil p retention is essential to improve

2010 unesco 2020 even small changes in air temperatures could have large impacts on the rainfall events and river runoffs pachauri et al 2014 intense rainfalls could intensify the mobilisation of

impact the in stream retentions and delivery along the upstream to downstream continuum doyle et al 2003 zhang et al 2017 for instance shifts in the magnitude and frequency of extreme high flows and floods could reduce river p retention capacity and in channel loss under eutrophic conditions withers and jarvie 2008 crossman et al 2013 revealed that shifts in rainfall and air temperature could result in an increase of up to 30 in the p loadings into lake simcoe which offset the p reduced through improved agricultural practices bosch et al 2014 revealed that with climate change there would be a 17 increase in the runoff and a 23 increase in nutrient yield in the lake erie basin in the usa to the best of our knowledge a detailed description of the processes related to the anthropogenic p inputs into the watershed terrestrial p retentions and climate changes from a holistic perspective is lacking we attempted to explore their dynamics using a process based catchment p model with a delicate soil module in this study a human dominated watershed in a cold climatic region in northeast asia is illustrated from a methodological viewpoint this application attempted a potential solution to simulate the dynamics of soil p retentions and riverine export using a process based catchment model from a water management perspective we suggest that a long term watershed p management plan should be targeted for reducing the historical p legacy inputs into the rivers rather than solely focusing on short term changes in river p concentrations and loading 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and riverine p monitoring the songhua river sr is one of the largest rivers in northeast asia with a length of 1 927 km and a streamflow of 7 6 1010 m3 per year wang et al 2015 the catchment of the songhua river basin srb e 119 52 132 31 n 41 42 51 38 fig 1 has an area of 5 6 105 km2 and a population of approximately 54 million williams et al 2015 it is a foothills fed river and the catchment receives water mainly from summer monsoon with a certain amount of snowfall in the high elevation streams li et al 2014 the watershed has a large difference in the topography and is surrounded by the highly elevated mountain regions above 1000 m fig s1 the main stream is divided into three sections an upper section from the head stream to songyuan a middle section from the songyuan to tonghe and a lower section from tonghe to tongjiang fig 1 the major tributaries include the nenjiang mudan hulan lalin and mayi rivers fig s1 according to the locations of the tributaries and the elevations of the basin a total of 10 sub basins were delineated ranging from forests to crop lands and including cities such as harbin and jilin figs s1 s2 and table s3 srb has varied climatology mainly due to differences in topography the monthly mean air temperature in the basin ranged from 17 6 c january to 20 6 c july with an annual average of 3 1 c fig s3 the annual average rainfall was 438 642 mm for 2008 2017 with the maximum in july 129 mm and the minimum in january only 4 9 mm an average of 110 rain days occurs in one year fig s3 since the 1960 s the air temperature in the watershed has been increasing at the rate of 0 3 0 4 c decade 1 jiang and wang 2019 more frequent extreme rainfall events have occurred in summer and autumn gou et al 2020 song et al 2015 yu

receives nutrients via the point e g wastewater effluent discharge and the diffuse sources e g land runoff tong et al 2017b a monitoring program was initiated in 2006 to identify the dynamics of riverine p loadings across the srb due to the high costs associated with the sampling and nutrient analysis long term and consistent water quality monitoring is rare in large rivers rowe et al 2013 sprague et al 2017 a total of 10 sites were monitored in the upper middle and lower streams 1 site each and major tributaries 7 sites monthly in the 2008 2017 fig 1 and their results are summarised in table 1 these monitoring sites were generally set at the outlet for each sub basin to incorporate the overall impacts of anthropogenic p inputs into the basins the procedure for water monitoring remained consistent during the study period which was based on the technical specification requirement for the monitoring of surface waters in china the sampling was usually conducted during the early days of the month an unfiltered surface water sample 1 l was collected from the middle stream of the channels because of the difficulties in p species analysis for such a long period only tp the sum of dissolved and particulate p was determined using the persulfate digestion automated colorimetric analysis with a method detection limit mdl of 10 μg l 1 in the subsequent data analysis all tp values lower than the mdl were set to 1 2 of the mdl 2 2 modelling soil p delivery and retention in the watershed in this study a process based catchment p model inca p nested within a delicate soil module was explored to model the soil p retentions and estimate p loadings from human inputs to river jackson blake et al 2016 inca is a semi distributed process based model that uses a mass balance approach to track flow and nutrient pathways in both terrestrial and aquatic compartment the model is based on a series of first order chemical equations that are solved by using the runge kutta method original version was developed by wade et al 2002 and it was modified by incorporating sediment erosions and the delivery process and modelling dissolved and particulate p separately instead of simulating bulk p jackson blake et al 2016 lazar et al 2010 different land use types were identified for each sub basin and all the land based processes i e p input storage and output were calculated

crops three p forms were assumed to exist in soil inactive labile and bio available goyette et al 2018 grenon et al 2021 sattari et al 2012 labile p can exchange with the bio available p through desorption and sorption the exchanges between inactive and labile p can occur through immobilisation and weathering jackson blake et al 2016 p flow pathways into rivers include direct runoff soil

cropping livestock operation municipal rural wastewater and aquaculture which are believed to be the dominant p sources liu et al 2016 tong et al 2020 this dataset was a part of our national data set calculated by the hierarchical national p cycling model which was applied to evaluate the impact of human p inputs on water tp concentrations tong et al 2017b tong et al 2020 to address spatial variations of human activities in the basin a raster dataset based on gridded population densities li et al 2019 livestock potter et al 2010 and land use types liu et al 2014 was developed the output was a high resolution map at a resolution of 1 1 km of anthropogenic p inputs with the five major sources for each year from 2008 to 2017 fig s4 and dataset s1 p output through crop harvests in the watershed was also estimated based on regional statistics and re distributed into 1 1 km grids according to the distribution of crop land 2 3 climate change scenario and modelling evaluation hydrological processes on land are largely controlled by climates which impact the soil p deliveries into the streams dudula and randhir 2016 mukundan et al 2020 to evaluate potential impacts climate projections by miroc5 based on the cmip5 global climate model forster et al 2013 were introduced into the model miroc5 was selected because of its good performance against historical air temperatures and rainfall records in the east asia chen et al 2021 fu et al 2020 we followed the previous studies to select the typical climate change projections jia et al 2021a jia et al 2021b fan and bai 2021 three representative concentration pathways i e rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 had been selected to represent future ghg emission scenarios rcp2 6 scenario is a peak scenario indicating that the radiative forcing level would reach 3 1 w m2 by the mid century but would return to 2 6 w m2 by 2100 rcp4 5 is the ghgs control strategy that is required to meet the 2 0 c aspiration that is set under the paris accord rcp8 5 is a business as usual scenario in which the ghg emissions continue to increase throughout the 21st century daily air temperature and rainfall data under the three rcp scenarios were extracted from specific grids in the watershed the extracted data was used to compare with the historical records and data from 2020 to 2050 was applied for the future simulations in the scenario analysis of the future p reductions and climate changes we first assumed that human p inputs i e point and diffuse source inputs fig 2 in the srb remained at the same level as that in 2017 and simulated the p input into the river from the soil in 2020 2050 with the results in fig 6 three climatic scenarios rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 were introduced to simulate the impacts of the climate changes second we have set up two p reduction scenarios e g 10 20 and 30 reduction in point or diffuse source inputs relative to the 2017 and simulate their responses in future riverine p loadings point source reduction refers to reduction on municipal wastewater input while the diffuse source refers to fertilizer use livestock farming and rural wastewater we assume a reduction 10 20 and 30 respectively for all the diffuse sources regardless of the types in this study 2006 and 2007 were considered as a warming up period to eliminate the initial biases such as initial quick flows initial soil water flow etc in modelling the monthly monitoring data obtained from water sampling sites and hydrological stations in the srb were applied for calibration and validation the models were calibrated by adjusting the inca p model parameters such as flow velocity and soil p process parameters to fit the flow and water quality records for the time period from 2008 to 2012 the major parameters potentially impacting the modelling performance has been summarized by the previous studies whitehead et al 2019 the model was subsequently validated for the time period of 2013 2017 the performance on the hydrodynamics was examined by stream flow rates in the mainstreams and tributaries fig s5 the performance in predicting the riverine p was examined by the tp monitoring results and riverine p loadings see the section of results figs s6 s7 due to the lack of data on water p species only tp concentration was used for applied the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and pearson correlation coefficients r between the simulated and monitoring results were calculated ervinia et al 2020 wu et al 2017 the river flow data was obtained from hydrological stations at the outlet of the sub watershed the monthly tp concentrations were obtained from the decadal river p monitoring project the riverine p export was calculated based on the measured river flow rate and p concentration initial soil p storage including the labile and inactive p in each sub basin was obtained from the china soil database shangguan et al 2013 fig s8 in general the initial soil inactive p in the basin ranged from 150 to 2085 mg kg but fluctuated in different land use types e g 736 mg kg in crop land and 985 mg kg in forest initial soil labile p contents ranged from 5 7 to 88 7 mg kg daily temperatures and rainfall data for 2008 2017 were used to simulate the hydrological process that was obtained from the weather stations in the basin http data cma cn spatial distribution data on the land use types soil property elevation and population density in the basin were provided by resources and environment science and data center china 3 results 3 1 temporal trend in the river p concentration and loading based on the monitoring data set of 2008 2017 we found that the tp concentration in the main streams of the sr and its tributaries remained relatively high summarized in table 1 in general a water tp concentration of 76 μg l 1 or higher could suggest a highly productive or eutrophic river system dodds et al 1998 stackpoole et al 2019 in 2017 the annual average tp concentrations in the upper middle and lower streams of river were 123 0 22 1 101 4 36 6 and 86 9 16 5 μg l 1 respectively which were all higher than the threshold large variations in tp concentrations were observed among the different tributaries table 1 the lowest tp was observed in the nenjiang river with the annual average of 65 1 27 3 μg l 1 whereas the highest tp value was observed in the woken river with an annual average of 166 2 68 1 μg l 1 a clear distinction was observed regarding the seasonality of tp concentrations with higher tp occurring in the wet season and lower tp in the dry season fig s9 an overall decline in the river tp concentrations was observed in the main streams at a rate of 0 3 0 9 μg l per month p 0 01 fig 3 and some tributaries fig s6 however rare changes were observed in riverine p export from 2008 to 2017 p 0 05 fig 3 in 2017 the annual tp export from the sr was approximately 6 600 mg at a rate of 13 2 kg km 2 among all the tributaries the nenjiang river contributed the largest p input into the main stream with an annual input of 1 250 mg accounting for 19 40 of the lower stream p export fig 4 a and table s3 tp loadings into the main stream from other tributaries were relatively small e g 113 mg by the woken river and 170 mg by the mayi river a strong seasonal variation in riverine p export was observed with the p loadings in summer 3 500 mg and autumn 1 400 mg occupying about 74 of the annual export fig 4b 3 2 inca p modelling results and the performance evaluation fig 3 also shows comparisons between the observed and simulated stream flows tp concentration and river p loading for the entire study period model performance was evaluated using r and nse an nse of 1 corresponds to a perfect match between the modelled and the observed data an nse of 0 indicates that the model prediction is as accurate as the average of the observed data in general the model showed good agreements between the observed and modelled flow tp concentration and p loading at all the sites in the main stream fig 3 with the r values ranging between 0 78 and 0 96 0 65 0 82 and 0 81 0 94 and nse values between 0 53 and 0 79 0 02 0 58 and 0 51 0 72 for the river flow tp concentration and river tp loadings respectively for the tributaries the nse values ranged from 0 11 to 0 87 for river flows from 0 01 to 0 49 for tp concentrations and from 0 22 to 0 83 for river p loadings figs s5 s7 in particular the model successfully depicted the decadal trends and seasonal changes e g the flooding and dry seasons of river flows and river p exports during the study period fig 3b and s7 3 3 anthropogenic p input and the land retention in contrast to the insignificant changes in river p export in the watershed fig 3 we found that the reductions in anthropogenic p input in the basin dataset s1 did not result in a decrease in the riverine p export an overall decline was observed in human p inputs into srb in 2008 2017 from 1 6 105 mg in 2008 to 1 3 105 mg in 2017 substantial p reduction was observed in the point source input from 4 450 mg in 2008 to 1 754 mg in 2017 this reduction was mainly achieved by the rapid construction of wwtps in the watershed where the number of operational wwtps increased from 71 in 2008 to 214 in 2017 in 2017 over 90 of the local wastewater discharge was treated before the discharge the relative impacts of diffuse and point source on receiving water were different as diffused source p input is retained in land before reaching the stream chen et al 2015 land retention defined as the fraction of diffused source p input retained in land could regulate the rates of p delivery into surface water thereby influencing the relative p contribution from diffused sources into rivers goyette et al 2018 powers et al 2016 stackpoole et al 2019 the modelling results indicated that the p input from the diffused sources and historical storage became increasingly dominant over time figs 5 and s10 from 2008 to 2017 the annual p inputs into the rivers from diffused sources increased from 7 600 to 8 900 mg in the entire srb at a rate of 133 8 mg year 1 with decrease in point source p input the fraction of point source input in total river p loadings declined from approximately 38 8 10 7 in 2008 to only 18 9 7 7 in 2017 fig 5 we found that the watershed had a strong capacity to retain p in the lands in 2017 the land retained approximately 93 6 1 6 of the diffused source p inputs see figure s10 the entire watershed retained approximately 189 kg p km 2 from the diffused source input in 2017 and 2 600 kg p km 2 was retained in the srb during the study period in particular our modelling has also indicated that the p retention capacity across the srb showed slow but substantial decrease during 2008 2017 fig s10 3 4 response in the land p retention under climate change scenarios under the climate change scenarios rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 air temperature and rainfall in the watershed is expected to change significantly significant increases in daily surface air temperature and rainfall can occur during 2020 2050 fig s11 with an annual increase of 0 01 0 04 c in air temperatures and an annual increase of 5 96 7 86 mm in the rainfall for three rcp scenarios occurrences of heavy rainfall events 25 mm in one day would be more frequent under all three climate change scenarios from 1 to 5 days per year for 2020 2030 to 4 9 days per year for 2040 2050 consequently annual river flows of the sr would increase by 8 15 relative to 2020 from 563 108 m3 in 2017 to 1 232 1 359 108 m3 during 2040 2050 table 2 we simulated the impacts of climate change on land p export to river and found that under the climate change scenarios p inputs from diffused sources and historical storage to river can increase substantially for 2020 2050 fig s12 even if anthropogenic p input in the srb remained at the same levels as those in 2017 the p contributions into rivers from the land could increase from 13 3 kg km 2 in 2017 to 22 6 25 8 kg km 2 in 2040 2050 4 discussion 4 1 a summary about soil p retention in the watershed p retained in soils forming a legacy is an underestimated pool that determines p exports to the downstream waterbodies hu et al 2020 powers et al 2016 sharpley et al 2013 stackpoole et al 2019 however it is difficult to be estimated accurately because of complicated soil p mechanism soil p retention could reduce the discharge into rivers and lakes in the short term while in the long term the accumulated p over time can act as a chronic p source even after the external input is reduced macintosh et al 2018 withers et al 2017 in general the p retention fraction of the diffused source input in the basin was to the value estimated by the global news model in this basin approximately 90 95 tysmans et al 2013 this fraction was higher than those in the yangtze river basin 40 50 liu et al 2018b and ganges river basin only 3 tysmans et al 2013 and was approaching to those in the lake erie basin 90 the lake michigan basin 95 and the mississippi river basin 91 han et al 2011 this indicates that a large fraction of the diffused source p inputs is the part of the historical p legacy the capacity to retain p in the land is supposed to be finite with a threshold beyond which riverine p export could increase substantially goyette et al 2018 in a survey targeting 23 watersheds in north america researchers have suggested a low threshold of 2 1 t p km 2 beyond this further p inputs into watersheds could cause a significant acceleration of p losses with runoff goyette et al 2018 in several regions e g east asia and north america historical agricultural p usage has been substantially greater than the actual needs of the crops macdonald et al 2011 thus a large amount of p originating from the historical p inputs has accumulated in the soils over time grenon et al 2021 macintosh et al 2018 soil p retentions would explain the differences in the responses of riverine p exports to anthropogenic p inputs into the watershed chen et al 2015 jarvie et al 2013 kusmer et al 2019 in general the human dominated basins may undergo a prolonged but finite accumulation period when p input exceeds the agricultural need the accumulated p could continue to mobilise long after the p inputs are reduced powers et al 2016 however different basins could have varying responses to anthropogenic p inputs depending on factors such as climatic conditions historical storage and soil properties hu et al 2020 kusmer et al 2019 4 2 watershed p management under climate change scenarios climatic factors have important implications for terrestrial p retentions chen et al 2015 fischer et al 2021 goyette et al 2016 a previous study observed a positive relationship between rainfall drainage outflow and increased p loading in the runoffs williams et al 2015 in a recent study in the western lake erie basin in the usa it was proposed that climate change would result in less nutrient runoff due to increased evaporation and decreased snowfall in spite of the increases in the overall amounts of precipitation kalcic et al 2019 however some other researchers hold the view that with the climate changes riverine p export would be enhanced largely due to the more frequent extreme rainfall events as indicated in agricultural regions in the midwestern region of the usa carpenter et al 2018 and three diverse agricultural catchments in the uk ockenden et al 2016 they further concluded that the impacts of climate changes would mainly occur in winter with an increase of up to 30 in the p loading by 2050 to mitigate these impacts a 20 80 reduction in the agricultural p inputs is required ockenden et al 2017 in the srb hydrological characteristics may change substantially in the future with climate change summarised in table 2 we simulated two p input reduction scenarios point and diffused source reductions under rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 for 2020 2050 we found that in the future compared with the no reduction scenarios fig 6 reductions of diffused source p inputs could have a greater effect on reducing the riverine p exports than the point source reduction with a 50 reduction in diffused source input riverine p exports may decrease from 10 564 641 mg in the scenarios without p reductions to 8 872 641 mg under the three climate scenarios for 2040 2050 with a 50 reduction in point source p input there would be a limited reduction in the riverine p loading for 2040 2050 fig 7 4 3 mitigation in agricultural practices in the watershed potential challenges revealed in the srb could be present in many other watersheds globally ockenden et al 2017 considering increasing contributions from diffused sources and historical p legacy the mitigation in the agricultural practices is required to reduce soil p loss under climate change scenarios arneth et al 2019 we suggest that three strategies should be considered in the future watershed p management first the historical p store should be taken into account and the p fertilizer usage should be reduced in fact after a long history of p fertilizer applications an increase in surface soil p content has occurred in many regions ma et al 2019 for agricultural systems located in europe and canada a reduction in the p fertilizer usage has been shown to have very few negative impacts on crop yield bast et al 2009 mogollón et al 2021 sattari et al 2012 however it would take a long period for recovery to the critical legacy p stock levels in the catchment chen et al 2019 for the regions e g usa and europe with substantial p legacies due to the extensive p fertiliser usages during 1970 2000 soil p legacies would allow crop productions without new p additions for approximately six decades mogollón et al 2021 sharpley et al 2013 second soil erosion should be alleviated by changing land use e g afforestation and reforestation of cultivated land the majority of soil p loss through runoff has been in the form of particulates chen et al 2015 since the 1950s due to the intensified farming in the srb the depth of the organic soil layers has decreased from 60 to 70 cm in the original cultivation period to only 20 30 cm fang and sun 2017 increased soil erosions can intensify the riverine p exports alewell et al 2020 thus soil conservations and the controls of sediment delivery into waters are beneficial e g reducing tillage intensity and construction of gully control shao et al 2021 yan et al 2018 third mineral fertilisers have been used to intensify terrestrial p retentions compared with the other watersheds many regions in the srb have relatively high soil organic contents which provide the releases of a large pool of p over time soluble phosphate available for crop uptake could form the inactive ionic complexes with the al and fe as well as the precipitation with ca grenon et al 2021 thus the application of mineral fertilisers could introduce ca or fe to these fields grenon et al 2021 organic soils with the greater fe and al stocks could show a higher retention of p in the lands larsen et al 1958 however this practice would not mitigate the soil p legacy issues but only reduce the delivery rates into the rivers 4 4 uncertainty in modelling and limitations there are always issues related to model uncertainties and model limitations in any flows and water quality modelling studies choa et al 2020 jia et al 2021a jia et al 2021b the fact that the system is dynamic and that the chemical processes are kinetic in nature and interact with the hydrology makes the modelling a complex process to the best of our knowledge this study is one of the few attempts to apply a process based model to simulate land p retention a similar but simpler case could be found in sattari et al s 2012 study which applied a two pool soil p model to depict the soil p residues this study has some limitations first unlike the traditional methods to model the soil p retention a process based model was developed inca p has progressed significantly in the soil p modules but soil p dynamic processes are still simple for example the roles of carbon and the other nutrients in the biological p uptakes mineralisation and immobilisation rates were not included second long term water monitoring data with the high frequency e g daily or even hourly particularly under high flow conditions are essential for validating the model however in this study only monthly monitoring data were used to validate the modelling result third future water monitoring should also include the other p species such as total dissolved and particulate p in addition to tp most of the p in the streams exists in the form of particulate p while dissolved p is more bioavailable future monitoring should reflect potential impacts of different p species in rivers 5 conclusions in summary this study applied a process based catchment p model with a delicate soil module to characterise the nexuses among p inputs from human activities land p retention and climate change we proposed that the increasing p contributions from diffused sources or historical legacy counteracted p reductions by improved sanitation in the srb under climate change scenarios p input into rivers from diffused sources and historical legacy would increase substantially which could constitute a challenge for water quality improvement we suggest that a long term perspective of watershed control strategy should target the controls and reduction of p inputs from the historical legacy rather than solely focusing on short term changes in riverine p concentrations and loadings credit authorship contribution

3758,actual evapotranspiration eta can be estimated using optical remote sensing and meteorological data herein we calibrated and applied the cmrset csiro modis reflectance based scaling evapotranspiration model at the continental scale in australia using five remotely sensed data products with spatial resolutions ranging from 500 m modis viirs 30 m landsat to 20 m sentinel 2 and temporal frequencies ranging from daily modis viirs to multi days landsat and sentinel 2 the five remotely sensed data products were used to compute a crop factor kc based on two vegetation indices which modify priestley taylor potential evapotranspiration estimates etp calculated from nation wide daily meteorological grids to obtain eta cmrset was calibrated using daily latent heat observations from 30 eddy covariance flux towers located across australia representing a wide variety of land covers and climates to ensure that cmrset adequately estimated open water evaporation daily etp estimates at six water sites were also added in the calibration network the calibrated cmrset model was able to estimate daily eta observed at the flux towers with a relative root mean squared error rrmse coefficient of determination r2 ranging between 0 15 0 96 with sentinel 2 to 0 26 0 93 viirs additionally we independently evaluated the performance of cmrset by comparing the long term 5 years or more differences between mean annual precipitation and eta with measured streamflow at 638 unimpaired catchments across australia the comparison showed a rmse of 0 50 mm d 1 rrmse of 0 26 and a r2 of 0 70 the cmrset model performed better than or similarly when compared against two global eta products based on modis optical and thermal data extending the suite of remotely sensed data products that cmrset is calibrated with and using a network of sites located across vast climate and geographic ranges means that cmrset can now be used to estimate eta at continental scales with multiple spatial resolutions and temporal frequencies compared to other available eta products cmrset is more straightforward to operationalise requires less data inputs can capture eta dynamics in areas with significant direct evaporation such as floodplains and lakes and does not require manual calibration to detect wet and dry pixels keywords evapotranspiration remote sensing modis viirs landsat

streamflow with the estimated eta in 227 unimpaired australian catchments located mainly in southeastern australia in an objective intercomparison of 8 approaches mainly remotely sensed based to

the underlying accuracy of the ground measurements that they are calibrated to which is 10 to 30 for eddy covariance flux towers glenn et al 2011 additionally compared to guerschman et al 2009 there is now access to more optical sensors e g viirs sentinel 2 and longer time spans particularly with modis and landsat it is also important to provide specific calibrations for each one of these sensors to account for differences in their spectral and radiometric properties it has been observed that sensors spectral and radiometric differences can result in dissimilar vegetation indices e g steven et al 2003 jarchow et al 2018 which can potentially lead to biased results in model estimations the main advantage of cmrset compared to other models which use remotely sensed data is its simplicity from satellite data cmrset only needs surface reflectance data as input and does not require thermal data which are generally of lower spatial resolution than the reflectance bands like in landsat and modis or are absent altogether like in sentinel 2 some other eta models which are based on vegetation indices share this advantage especially in arid or semi arid environments e g nagler et al 2013 2020 cmrset does not need additional information such as a land cover map e g the penman monteith leuning evapotranspiration v2 product pml v2 of zhang et al 2019 or the determination of the hot and cold anchor pixels e g the sebal model bastiaanssen et al 1998a 1998b finally cmrset brings the additional advantage of being able to accurately estimate eta from standing water e g floods and water bodies ranging from large dams to small on farm storages something that eta models based on vegetation indices alone cannot do the goal of this paper is by building on the work of guerschman et al 2009 to provide an eta algorithm that is forthright to implement from field to continental scales and from day to multi day resolutions we do this by i enhancing the spatial resolution and temporal frequency by including sensors other than modis such as viirs landsat and sentinel 2 ii further calibrating cmrset using an enhanced collection of observed eta from eddy covariance flux towers i e 30 flux towers better representing the array of environments and covering a longer timespan and iii evaluating the results using 638 unimpaired catchments distributed across a wider geography and climate

30 vegetation cover glenn et al 2011 the tropical regions in the north have open savannas and forests with vegetation cover of 50 or more where precipitation is provided by monsoonal systems which penetrate inland mainly during the austral summer months december to february the temperate regions include grass dominated vegetation and forests thackway and cresswell 1995 and precipitation is provided by both frontal systems and convective events these are the regions where most of the cropping systems are located both rainfed and irrigated for most of the continent precipitation is lower than potential evapotranspiration glenn et al 2011 their fig 1 c and 80 of the precipitation is returned to the atmosphere as eta zhang et al 2016 their fig 4 a with the remainder contributing to groundwater recharge or streamflow 2 2 observed actual evapotranspiration eta measurements of latent heat obtained from 31 eddy covariance towers included in the ozflux network isaac et al 2017 are summarised in table 1 and their locations are shown in fig 1 the observations from each tower were processed using the dynamic integrated gap filling and partitioning for ozflux dingo software as detailed in beringer et al 2017 this includes gap filling of missing observations using artificial neural networks and establishing metrics for diagnosing the surface energy balance closure in the ozflux network 50 of the site years had a surface energy balance ratio of 0 89 or higher and 80 of the sites years had a ratio greater than 0 80 isaac et al 2017 the dingo outputs are hourly or half hourly values at each flux tower we aggregated the latent heat flux observations to a daily mean if at least 20 h of data were available for each day or 40 half hours we converted latent heat from units of energy per area to units of water per time using the conversion factor 28 94 w m 2 1 mm d 1 mean values of eta and time series start and end dates for each ozflux site are provided in table 1 in addition to the eta observations from eddy covariance measurements we estimated potential evapotranspiration etp for six water reservoirs and following zhang et al 2019 assumed that eta etp these reservoirs were located across the continent to sample the variability in climate fig 1 and were large enough to obtain pure surface reflectance data from a 3x3 pixel window of the coarsest sensor i e modis and viirs both with nominal spatial resolutions of 500 m used herein we would have preferred using direct actual evaporation measurements from standing water surfaces but such observations from large enough reservoirs do not exist 2 3 climate data and potential evapotranspiration gridded climate data were obtained from the australian bureau of meteorology bom interpolated climate variables jones et al 2009 these grids cover the australian continent at a spatial resolution of 0 05 approximately 5 km 5 km with a daily timestep and are generated by interpolating observations from weather stations precipitation maximum and minimum air temperature and vapour pressure or from geostationary satellites incoming shortwave solar radiation daily values of precipitation maximum and minimum near surface air temperature and incoming shortwave solar radiation were obtained for each pixel in which the ozflux station or the open water site is located table 1 we derived daily etp using the priestley taylor 1972 formulation which uses the minimum and maximum near surface air temperature and incoming shortwave solar radiation as inputs we calculated the fraction of daylight hours as a function of the day of year and the latitude following forsythe et al 1995 the python code used to calculate etp is provided in the supplementary material mean values of etp and precipitation for each site corresponding to the period with available flux tower eta data are provided in table 1 it is noted that while there are etp or reference et products which use more complex formulations in australia priestley taylor etp has proven consistent when compared to more complex formulations in selected sites in australia chiew and leahy 2003 after careful analysis of the daily eta etp and precipitation values in each flux tower we decided to eliminate the cow bay site 16 2382s 145 4272w this site is in close proximity to the coast has a high local relative relief driving strong orthographic precipitation gradients and low density of nearby precipitation gauges for the spatial interpolation algorithm we performed the analyses with data from 30 flux towers 2 4 satellite data 2 4 1 modis 2 4 1 1 mcd43a4 we used the nadir bidirectional reflectance distribution function adjusted reflectance nbar product from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis sensor collection 6 schaaf and wang 2015 which has the specific product code mcd43a4 this product provides a rolling daily 16 day composite surface reflectance weighted to retrieve the value on the ninth day of the 16 day period all cloud free observations in the 16 day compositing period from both the terra morning overpass and aqua afternoon overpass satellites carrying the modis sensor were used to derive the nbar surface reflectance for each pixel mcd43a4 has a spatial resolution of 500 m and is available from 18 feb 2000 the uncertainties in the product are well characterised via independent measurements in a systematic and statistically robust way representing global conditions wang et al 2018 mcd43a4 includes four bands in the visible near infrared region and three bands in the shortwave infrared mcd43a4 data were accessed from google earth engine gee gorelick et al 2017 2 4 1 2 mod09a1 this product provides an estimate of the daily surface spectral reflectance of terra morning overpass from the modis sensor for the same seven bands as mcd43a4 corrected for atmospheric conditions vermote 2015 for each pixel a value is selected from all the acquisitions within the 8 day composite period based on quality control criteria including cloud and solar zenith angles when several acquisitions meet the criteria the pixel with the minimum blue reflectance is used unlike mcd43a4 mod09a1 is not corrected for bidirectional reflectance distribution function effects potentially introducing errors in products derived from surface reflectance products such as eta our motivation for calibrating the cmrset algorithm using mod09a1 is that the same algorithm is used to generate a near real time modis product mod09 nrt 006 therefore making it possible to deliver cmrset eta estimates in near real time mod09a1 includes the same 7 reflective bands as mcd43a4 at 500 m resolution and is available from 24 feb 2000 mod09a1 data were accessed from gee 2 4 2 viirs the visible infrared imaging radiometer suite viirs daily surface reflectance vnp09ga justice et al 2013 product provides an estimate of daily land surface reflectance from the suomi national polar orbiting partnership s npp viirs sensor data are provided for three bands at nominal 500 m 463 m resolution and nine moderate resolution bands at nominal 1 km 926 m resolution these bands are corrected for atmospheric conditions to provide an estimate of the surface spectral reflectance justice et al 2013 the data are temporally aggregated over each of the 16 possible passes per day when multiple observations are present for each day only the first of the highest quality observations is included vnp09ga data were accessed from gee and are available from 19 jan 2012 2 4 3 landsat atmospherically corrected surface reflectance collection 2 level 2 tier 1 from the tm etm and oli sensors from the landsat 5 7 and 8 satellites respectively were accessed from gee usgs 2021a and 2021b reflectance values from the tm on landsat 5 and etm on landsat 7 sensors were harmonised to the oli sensor on landsat 8 using the empirical functions from roy et al 2016 these images contain four visible and near infrared bands vnir and two short wave infrared swir bands processed to orthorectified surface reflectance the vnir and swir bands have a resolution of 30 m these data have been atmospherically corrected using ledaps usgs 2020 and include a cloud shadow water and snow mask produced using cfmask foga et al 2017 as well as a per pixel saturation mask landsat tm data are available on gee from march 1984 yet due to a limited number of flux towers operating pre 2000 see table 1 we limit the landsat analysis from 01 feb 2000 i e the same timespan as the two modis products used here 2 4 4 sentinel 2 data from the multispectral instrument sensor onboard the sentinel 2a and sentinel 2b satellites drusch et al 2012 were obtained from the digital earth australia dea database we did not source sentinel 2 data from gee because the level 2a orthorectified atmospherically corrected surface reflectance available in gee for australia was not available before 01 dec 2018 dea in contrast includes corrected surface reflectance data from sentinel 2 since the beginning of the sentinel 2 record on 12 jul 2015 dea applies nbar correction which involves atmospheric correction to compute bottom of atmosphere radiance and bi directional reflectance modelling to remove the effects of topography and sun target sensor angular variation in reflectance following li et al 2010 2012 a full description of the data product and processing can be found in https cmi ga gov au data products dea 190 surface reflectance nbart 1 sentinel 2 msi accessed 24 nov 2021 surface reflectance for the s2a ard granule and s2b ard granule was sourced for all the sentinel 2 bands available this includes eight visible near infrared bands at 10 or 20 m resolution and two shortwave infrared bands at 20 m resolution dea applied a cloud masking algorithm coluzzi et al 2018 to all sentinel 2 imagery however due to sub optimal performance of such algorithm likely due to sentinel 2 not having thermal capacity per chen et al 2021 we visually inspected all sentinel 2 images extracted for the sites listed in table 1 and excluded all sentinel 2 images affected by clouds or cloud shadows 2 5 catchment streamflow data we obtained streamflow q data from the australian bureau of meteorology bom for 780 unregulated and unimpaired catchments i e not significantly affected by regulation structures or streamflow extraction in australia based on zhang et al 2013 this dataset includes daily end of catchment streamflow ml d 1 catchment boundaries updated using bom s geofabric v3 2 beta and relevant catchment attributes http www bom gov au water geofabric download shtml accessed 16 nov 2021 this dataset has been used for calibrating and evaluating hydrological and landscape models in australia and globally zhang et al 2016 ukkola et al 2016 tian et al 2019 we further refined the datasets by i calculating mean monthly streamflow discarding months with less than 25 daily observations and ii discarding catchments with less than 60 months 5 years of data the resulting dataset includes 638 catchments fig 1 which were later used for evaluating the eta model performance by estimating the long term catchment water balance that is et a p q for each catchment we calculated mean daily precipitation from the bom interpolated climate grids introduced above 3 methods 3 1 the cmrset model the csiro modis reflectance based scaling evapotranspiration cmrset developed by guerschman et al 2009 was recalibrated using more up to date modis imagery herein and calibrated for the first time using viirs landsat and sentinel 2 using a crop factor approach allen 2000 cmrset uses two reflective remotely sensed indices to scale etp to eta cmrset also uses a scaling factor to account for interception i e evaporation from vegetation surfaces during and just after precipitation events the indices calculated from reflectance data are the enhanced vegetation index evi huete et al 2002 and the global vegetation moisture index gvmi ceccato et al 2002b a 1 evi g ρ nir ρ red ρ nir c 1 ρ red c 2 ρ blue l 2 gvmi ρ nir 0 1 ρ swir 0 02 ρ nir 0 1 ρ swir 0 02 where ρred ρnir ρblue and ρswir are the reflectances in red near infrared blue and shortwave infrared bands respectively to calculate evi g c1 c2 and l are parameters that account for aerosol scattering and absorption and their values are 2 5 6 7 5 and 1 respectively huete et al 1994 huete et al 1997 table 2 shows which bands were used from each of the five remote sensing data products to calculate evi and gvmi herein evi is rescaled to a value between 0 and 1 following 3 evi r m i n m a x evi evi min evi max evi min 0 0 9 where evimin 0 and evimax 0 9 evir is capped at 0 when evi evimin and capped at 0 9 when evi evimax a residual moisture index rmi is calculated combining evi and gvmi as 4 rmi m a x g v m i k rmi e v i c rmi 0 where k rmi and c rmi are parameters fitted during model calibration the rmi represents the distance in the gvmi axis to the line determined by the k rmi and c rmi parameters the rationale behind this is that evi provides the signal form the vegetation vigour and the rmi adds information on the vegetation structure by separating vegetation types with the same evi and it also provides a metric to identify open water surfaces the combined use of evi and gvmi in this index improves the model performance as the vegetation moisture content can be used as a surrogate for canopy conductance and because open water surfaces can be separated from bare soil and vegetation actual evapotranspiration et a is estimated in cmrset as 5 et a k c et p k ei p where k c is the crop factor that represents the ratio of actual to potential evapotranspiration similar to the fao k in allen 2000 k ei represents interception fraction of p and p is precipitation in cmrset et p and p are obtained from the bom interpolated climate grids jones et al 2009 the interception term k ei is linearly related to the rescaled enhanced vegetation index evir as 6 k ei k ei max evi r where k ei max is a parameter fitted during model calibration the crop factor term kc is calculated as 7 k c k c max 1 e a e v i r α b r m i β where k c max is a parameter fitted during model calibration which is multiplied by a sigmoidal function that depends simultaneously on the evir and rmi and a α b and β are also parameters fitted during model calibration during model calibration constraints or bounds were placed on the parameter ranges to ensure that the final parameter set was physically meaningful these parameter calibration ranges are reported in table s1 in summary cmrset requires the evi and gvmi indices from remotely sensed data et p and p from interpolated climate grids and returns eta using 8 parameters 3 2 pre processing of satellite data in eddy covariance measurements the footprint of the instrument i e the area contributing to the recorded energy and matter fluxes is a function of several factors including height of the instrument surface roughness wind speed and wind direction göckede et al 2004 rebmann et al 2005 a commonly used heuristic rule indicates that approximately 75 of the flux derives from an area bound by an upwind distance that is between 20 and 30 times the effective measurement height arriga et al 2017 following this principle we extracted median reflectance for each band and each sensor on all available images using a circular area around each ozflux tower of radius equal to 30 times the instrument height table 1 we included all cloud free pixels with centroid located inside the circular footprint for the six open water sites table 1 we used a circle of 300 m radius using the median reflectance values from these areas we then derived the evi and gvmi indices for each day with reflectance and eta measurements we calculated the mean eta etp and p from the pixels overlying the tower by averaging the 7 days centered in the day of satellite overpass or the middle day of the composite period for mcd43a4 mod09a1 and vnp09ga in this way the observed conditions are averaged for a week centered on the satellite overpass for the modis and viirs products this 7 day mean represents the average eta and climatic conditions of the period for which the reflectance is averaged in the case of landsat and sentinel 2 imagery even though they observe the surface on a specific date as most land surface conditions captured by reflective remote sensing change gradually through time using a 7 day eta etp and p mean is more appropriate than using the observations for the specific date of satellite overpass as a result of this process cmrset is effectively estimating the eta of the daily conditions smoothed over a 7 day period 3 3 model calibration the cmrset model was calibrated by searching for the values of the parameters that minimised the objective function 8 j et a o ij et a m ij 2 where et a o ij and et a m ij are the observed and modelled eta in the site i and 7 day mean on day j respectively this means that all sites were pooled during model calibration eight parameters were calibrated being k c max a α b β k ei max k rmi and c rmi the total number of observations i j varied according to the specific remotely sensed data product depending on frequency of observation cloud conditions and date when the product commenced all sites and dates pooled together i j were used for model calibration to test whether the inclusion of the open water sites produced a substantial change on the estimated parameters and model performance in the ozflux sites we repeated the calibration procedure excluding these sites we used the trust region reflective optimisation algorithm implemented in the least squares routine of python s scipy v 1 5 2 the initial values for the parameters were those of the calibrated model of guerschman et al 2009 the resulting model parameters for the five remote sensing products and initial set of parameter bounds used for calibrating all remote sensing products are reported in table s1 these five remote sensing product specific parameter sets define cmrset v2 version 2 with cmrset v1 being the parameter set reported in guerschman et al 2009 that is specific for the modis collection 4 product denoted mod43b4 to test the sensitivity of the model parameters to the addition of specific sites or sites from a particular köppen geiger class beck et al 2018 or ecoregion olson et al 2001 we performed three bootstrap or jack knifing cross calibrations in each iteration the data from a particular site from all sites of a particular köppen geiger class or from all sites of a particular ecoregion were removed from the dataset then the model was calibrated and finally applied to the site s which had been removed we then compared the differences in the et a m ij obtained at the site s without removing them the following evaluation metrics were used following richter et al 2011 i the coefficient of determination r2 of a fitted linear regression between observed and modelled data which reflects temporal correlation it is bound between 0 0 and 1 0 with r2 0 9 indicating excellent correlation 0 8 r2 0 9 indicating very good correlation and 0 5 r2 0 8 indicating good correlation ii the root mean squared error rmse and mean absolute error mae which indicates magnitude of error the closer the rmse or mae value to 0 the more accurate the model is iii the relative root mean squared error rrmse and mean absolute error rmae which indicate magnitude of error relative to the mean with rrmse 0 1 indicating excellent accuracy and 0 2 rrmse 0 3 indicating good accuracy rrmse calculated as rmse divided by the mean of the observations 3 4 model evaluation we tested the model performance by applying the modelled eta obtained with the daily modis nbar product mcd43a4 to all pixels in the 638 unimpaired catchments with streamflow q data these data are independent of the data used for model calibration and used here for model evaluation following oreskes et al 1994 we avoid using the terms validation or verification we selected the mcd43a4 product as it has a long record i e greater than 20 years unlike viirs and sentinel 2 and continuous gap free data unlike landsat the resulting daily eta was paired to the daily observed q and p and aggregated to long term mean in the same way as with q i e discarding the eta and p estimates when q data was missing calculating monthly eta and p if the month included at least 25 daily q values and then calculating long term mean eta e t a and mean p p if at least 60 monthly values were available we then compared i net excess precipitation p e t a with streamflow q and ii p q with et a the assumption made in this evaluation is that by averaging over at least 5 years of q data the effects of differences between the initial and final amount of stored water were minimised i e groundwater and soil moisture in the catchment han et al 2020 3 5 comparison with global eta products we compared the performance of the calibrated cmrset model with two satellite driven eta global products the modis terra net evapotranspiration 8 day global mod16a2 collection 006 mu et al 2011 running et al 2017 combines reflective data from the modis sensor and global meteorological observations to provide eta and etp at 500 m resolution mod16a2 uses leaf area index lai albedo and land cover data derived from modis products with meteorological variables from interpolated global climate data as inputs into a model based on the penman monteith method cleugh et al 2007 and calculates canopy conductance and eta the penman monteith leuning evapotranspiration v2 product pml v2 zhang et al 2019 also provides global eta coupled with gross primary product at 500 m resolution and 8 day intervals pml v2 combines modis leaf area index and albedo both derived from reflective modis data and modis emissivity thermal data we obtained the eta values estimated by mod16a2 and pml v2 for the ozflux and water sites in the same way as performed for the surface reflectance cmrset inputs as described above we also obtained the mean eta values from mod16a2 and pml v2 for the 638 catchments used for cmrset model evaluation the eta products used in this comparison were the only two available at the modis resolution or better 500 m and available globally therefore allowing us to compare with our modis driven cmrset model in australia additionally pml v2 has been calibrated with flux towers and evaluated with long term catchment water balance in a similar way to our approach and compared favorably to mod16a2 and to the gleam model of martens et al 2017 3 6 assessment of spatiotemporal model performance we used google earth engine gorelick et al 2017 to apply the best model calibration for each data product and obtain spatial estimates of eta across the australian continent the interpolated daily climate grids were uploaded to google servers and used within the earth engine code editor environment the assessment was performed visually by comparing cmrset s eta estimates at different resolutions and in different geographical locations and under different land cover conditions we focused in areas with i recurrent flood inundation ii complex hydromorphology and iii a mosaiced landscape with a mixture of irrigated agriculture and native vegetation 4 results 4 1 model calibration when assessing the optimised cmrset models with daily flux tower observations of eta the root mean squared error rmse ranged between 0 47 mm d 1 with sentinel 2 to 0 60 mm d 1 vnp09ga table 3 these values represent a relative rmse rrmse of 0 16 sentinel 2 to 0 26 vnp09ga the coefficient of determination r2 ranged from a maximum of 0 96 sentinel 2 to a minimum of 0 93 viirs the performance of cmrset with the two modis products and landsat was similar with rmse rrmse and r2 around 0 63 mm d 1 0 21 and 0 93 respectively see table 3 all the water sites had an excellent fit r2 higher than 0 9 and rrmse lower than 0 05 between estimated and observed eta assumed equal to etp this indicates that the evi and gvmi indices derived from the reflective satellite data were successful in detecting standing water we stress that these water sites do not have actual measurement of evaporation the eta was assumed equal to the etp for this reason we also report the results if these water sites are not included in statistics for the 30 flux tower sites pooled together the rmse ranged between 0 60 and 0 76 mm d 1 rrmse of 0 38 0 48 and the r2 between 0 62 and 0 73 including the water sites in the calibration improved the performance indicators to further test the sensitivity of cmrset to the inclusion of the water sites we repeated the calibration with those six sites removed the model performance for individual sites did not change greatly between the five satellite products used and also importantly they were not overly affected by inclusion or exclusion of these six water sites in the calibration process fig 2 and fig s1 to fig s5 the sites in the temperate wet köppen geiger class green symbols in fig 2 had the best model performance with correlations of 0 7 and higher and no substantial bias the sites in the tropical köppen geiger class light blue symbols in fig 2 also showed high correlation 0 7 and higher and a lower range of modelled eta compared to the observed the two sites in the temperate dry köppen geiger classes yellow symbols in fig 2 had also lower correlation 0 2 to 0 5 and a higher range of modelled eta compared to the observed sites in the arid dry köppen geiger classes red symbols in fig 2 had more variable performance with correlations between 0 14 and 0 7 depending on site and sensor used and no clear pattern in relation to modelled and observed range in eta importantly results from the bootstrapping exercise showed that no site changed its model performance when the site was not used for model calibration fig s6 when all sites of a particular köppen geiger class were excluded from the calibration the resultant eta estimates were much worse for the six water sites and also the r2 decreased for the sites located in the bwh arid desert hot climate class fig s7 4 2 model evaluation when long term catchment mean estimated eta was compared to the difference between long term catchment mean precipitation and long term catchment mean streamflow in 638 catchments the two variables showed an rmse of 0 50 mm d 1 mae 0 31 mm d 1 and a r2 of 0 27 these results were obtained with the calibration using all flux tower and water sites and the mcd43a4 product when the comparison was made between net excess precipitation p e t a and streamflow q the rmse and mae was the same and the r2 was 0 70 due to the correlation between p and q fig 3 the mean p q and et a were 1 93 and 1 76 mm d 1 respectively there was no apparent bias between catchments driven by köppen geiger climate classes four catchments in the arid climate zone with very low mean streamflow had a modelled et a higher than p of up to 2 mm d 1 the r2 between monthly p et a and q was high 0 6 in catchments with a high seasonal variability in p irrespective of the long term mean q q this included catchments in the northern monsoonal part of australia the coastal regions of qld and nsw and in tasmania fig 4 r2 was lower 0 6 in drier catchments of southern australia 4 3 comparison with global eta products the calibrated cmrset model using the mcd43a4 product performed consistently better than the mod16a2 product mu et al 2011 running et al 2017 and slightly better than the pml v2 product zhang et al 2019 when comparing against the observed eta at the 30 ozflux sites fig 5 and fig s9 the mod16a2 product does not provide eta estimates over permanent water bodies values are masked and the pml v2 product assumes similar to cmrset eta to be equal to etp calculated with the penman monteith method because we do not have eta observations from suitably large water bodies we did not include those in the comparison between cmrset and pml v2 either the comparison between cmrset mod16a2 and pml v2 for the 638 unimpaired catchments showed similar results to the comparison performed using the ozflux sites cmrset performed substantially better than mod16a2 and very similar to pml v2 fig 6 in this case pml v2 was slightly better in estimating long term water balance than cmrset lower mae rmse and higher r2 4 4 spatiotemporal model performance fig 7 shows the eta estimated using mcd43a4 for all australia for 12 nov 2019 when evaporative demand starts increasing in the late austral spring months three insets in fig 7 illustrate alternative spatial patterns captured by each of the five input remotely sensed data products in the first inset flooding which occurred on 14 feb 2019 in the gulf plains is captured by the five data products and standing water shows high 7 mm d 1 evaporation rates the area that is not under water corresponds to a mosaic of tropical savannas and grasslands and shows eta values between 1 and 6 mm d 1 the second inset corresponds to 15 aug 2019 in the cooper diamantina plains region in the channel country an intricate mosaic of riparian wetlands waterholes and arid shrublands eta values range from 0 mm d 1 in the arid shrublands to 2 3 mm d 1 in the riparian wetlands and exceed 4 mm d 1 in the waterholes the third inset shows also an intricate complex spatial pattern of rainfed and irrigated crops riparian vegetation and standing water in the murrumbidgee region at the onset of the summer irrigation season on 12 nov 2019 when summer irrigated crops coexist with rainfed perennial pastures again the eta estimated by cmrset illustrates that this range of land cover types exhibit different water use rates a dynamic monthly version of the modis landsat and viirs maps presented in this paper are viewable online from https tern landscapes earthengine app view aet datasets 5 discussion we calibrated guerschman et al s 2009 cmrset model using a wider selection of remotely sensed data products and a much larger collection of on ground measurements of eta and in this way better represented the array of environmental conditions in australia summarised in table 4 when using mcd43a4 we achieved a rmse of 0 62 mm d 1 equivalent to 18 9 mm month 1 table 3 this is similar to that obtained in the initial calibration of cmrset see table 2 in guerschman et al 2009 with two important differences firstly the eta estimates herein are at the daily time step whereas the original cmrset was calibrated and applied at the monthly time step secondly cmrset was previously calibrated for modis only and as the vegetation indices used in cmrset require more than just the modis 250 m red and nir bands its spatial resolution was limited to 500 m in contrast as implemented herein both sentinel 2 20 m and landsat 30 m cmrset estimates can now be generated here the performance of the individual flux tower sites ranged from a maximum rmse of 1 8 mm d 1 in fogg dam to a minimum of 0 4 mm d 1 dargo with the vast majority i e 27 of 30 of the ozflux sites reported a rmse in the range of 0 5 1 1 mm d 1 table 3 and fig s6 cmrset eta estimated at the sites in the temperate köppen geiger class had the best correlation and least bias table 3 fig 2 and fig s1 to fig s5 the sites in the tropical class also tended to have high correlation but cmrset captured less of the seasonal variability in eta the sites in the arid class tended to have eta estimated with the lowest correlation the agreement between observed eta and cmrset s eta estimation is a combination of the etp driven by interpolated climate data and the kc governed by the remote sensing inputs the temperate and tropical areas are highly seasonal with a well defined growing season limited by either temperature water or both in those regions etp captures such seasonality and that already provides a high correlation between observed and estimated eta also explaining the lower correlation in the arid and temperate hot climate classes whether cmrset also captures the magnitude of this seasonal signal depends on the specifics of each site and is governed by the dynamics of the vegetation and how well these dynamics are captured by vegetation indices used in cmrset for example in four tropical savanna sites with a strong signal from the grassy component i e adelaide river daly river pasture daly river uncleared and dry river cmrset overestimated eta during the dry season possibly caused by the evi not dropping to very low values despite the very low observed eta fig s1 to fig s5 a local calibration of cmrset only using these sites or sites from any other region could potentially improve the performance of the model in those environments it is also possible that cmrset based on reflective data alone does not adequately capture water stress during the dry season in these environments an alternative formulation which uses surface thermal data and or remotely sensed soil moisture kalma et al 2008 bastiaanssen et al 2012 could potentially help overcome this issue but at the same time make cmrset more difficult to implement the temporal scale of aggregation influences the magnitude of the prediction error generally decreasing as longer time steps are considered fig 8 the median percent error at the weekly scale was 27 2 which decreased to 11 7 when mean annual eta was considered over the 638 unimpaired catchments with 5 or more years of q data the calibrated cmrset model was able to estimate long term water balance comparing et a with p q with a median percent error of 13 8 fig 8 incorporating water sites in the calibration where eta was assumed to be equal to etp ensured that the new cmrset parameters continue to be able to estimate open water evaporation accurately this is one of the advantages of cmrset as traditional vegetation index based methods fail to estimate open water evaporation well glenn et al 2010 which therefore limits their utility to provide accurate eta estimates across the entire landscape for use in catchment scale water accounting in cmrset the combined use of evi and gvmi achieves this and avoids the need to use an ancillary and usually static land cover map to detect standing water which is very dynamic in large parts of australia such as in floodplains and reservoirs see fig 9 in mueller et al 2015 the vegetation indices used by cmrset equation 4 internally separate water and other types of surface cover peña arancibia et al 2021 the inclusion of the water sites did not cause any degradation in the performance of cmrset on the flux tower sites fig 2 if the water sites were not used in contrast the ability of cmrset to estimate open water evaporation was degraded rmse changing from 0 3 to 2 5 mm d 1 and r2 decreasing from 0 98 to 0 80 fig s7 to avoid making the eta equals etp assumption an impoundment water balance can be used for typically monitored water sites like reservoirs to calculate eta inflows e g streamflow from contributing catchments and precipitation over the water surface and outflows i e dam releases along with changes in the water storage depth and possibly also accounting for changes in water surface area as a function of water depth are routinely monitored in australia s supply reservoirs to estimate a water resources assessment ndpie 2021 while there would be some uncertainty in such calculations as examples water levels responding to wind push and unknown amounts of groundwater recharge from the reservoir these calculations would likely provide suitable eta estimates for future calibration exercises another important advantage of the new model calibration reported herein is that the five remote sensing based data products used sensors ranging from coarse 500 m resolution to the sentinel 2 sensor with 20 m spatial resolution when using the different sensors the overall performance of cmrset was similar table 3 fig 2 and fig s1 to fig s5 with the exception of sentinel 2 which showed better performance lower rmse as sentinel 2 only started in 12 jul 2015 there are many less concurrent eta and sentinel 2 observations and several flux tower sites did not have in situ observations available post 2016 i e the flux tower had already closed therefore the enhanced performance of sentinel 2 does not necessarily indicate improved eta estimation with sentinel 2 in all conditions when applied to the five remote sensing data products the recalibrated cmrset model was able to capture spatial patterns of eta at the continental scale to fine resolution features at the field scale fig 7 the range of sensors used here provide users with a large array of alternatives regarding spatial resolution from 20 m sentinel 2 to 500 m in modis or viirs temporal revisit daily for modis viirs through 5 days for sentinel 2 to 16 days for landsat and temporal coverage from 1987 for landsat 5 7 and 8 combined 2000 for modis 2012 for viirs and 2016 for sentinel 2 cloud cover in turn adds an additional constraint to the availability of useful optical remotely sensed data whitcraft et al 2015 wilson and jetz 2016 the degree of cloud contamination is a function of the geographical location as it depends on the climate patterns e g monsoon season in the tropics we quantified the availability of cloud free images in each site for each data product and a clear seasonal pattern emerged fig s10 in the tropical sites located in northern australia the availability of cloud free imagery during the austral summer the wet season dropped to almost half of that observed in the austral winter the dry season the pattern was inverted in the temperate sites located in southern australia that experience relatively warm cloud free austral summers with the availability of cloud free imagery decreasing in the austral winter no single data product though can efficiently cater for all possible uses as spatial resolution tends to be inversely correlated with temporal revisit time further research is needed to explore alternatives for blending these data products and the cmrset eta estimates to produce high frequency high resolution products to satisfy the needs of many potential users e g jarihani et al 2014 chen et al 2020 given the gaps that exist in the high resolution i e landsat and sentinel 2 imagery when cloud is considered see table s3 the recalibrated cmrset model using the mcd43a4 data product was evaluated with an independent dataset of observed streamflow from 638 catchments the model estimated catchment water balance i e p q with a rmse of 0 47 mm d 1 equivalent to 171 mm y 1 fig 3 this is somewhat higher than a similar evaluation performed in the first version of cmrset over 227 catchments guerschman et al 2009 a subset of those used here rmse 137 mm y 1 the additional 411 catchments included to the streamflow dataset were mainly located in northern territory and western australia in the arid and tropical köppen geiger zones and are generally much larger catchments than the catchments used in the earlier cmrset calibration paper compare fig 1 here with fig 1 in guerschman et al 2009 in these catchments during large flood events streamflow can exceed the calibration ranges of streamflow rating curves and make q estimates more uncertain scarm 2000 additionally these catchments were in areas with sparse gauging networks and rainfall events can be convective and of short duration making p estimates more uncertain jones et al 2009 their fig 2 a the two factors are likely the cause of the apparent decrease in accuracy when evaluating the catchment water balance with cmrset the cmrset model calibrated here using mcd43a4 showed a much better performance than the modis land eta product mod16a2 when compared to the ozflux data and when compared to long term catchment water balance fig 5 compared to zhang et al s 2019 pml v2 product cmrset had very similar performance at the 30 ozflux sites and provided marginally worse long term catchment water balance statistics the pml v2 model like cmrset was calibrated using a global dataset of 95 eddy covariance flux towers 16 of the 30 used herein were used in zhang et al 2019 and uses surface emissivity data from modis in addition to leaf area index and albedo derived from reflective bands cmrset was able to achieve a similar or better degree of accuracy with a simpler model structure and data input needs it should be noted that the flux tower eta data used in this study correspond mainly to natural i e where there is no agriculture or other anthropogenic management land covers in addition the water balance evaluation was performed for catchments largely undisturbed i e by regulation or water withdrawals for agriculture or other uses peña arancibia et al 2021 evaluated the cmrset model parameterised as in guerschman et al 2009 in irrigated areas in southeast australia the evaluation was performed by comparing cmrset against two routinely used remotely sensed crop factor eta models and the results showed that cmrset compared well in both magnitude and temporal patterns while we have not explicitly evaluated the current parameterisation of cmrset in agricultural sites the similar catchment water balance results of this version of cmrset when compared to the guerschman et al 2009 cmrset version suggest that there are no large biases at the multi annual scale and hence results should also be similar in agricultural areas the parameterisation of cmrset with landsat and sentinel 2 products enables the evaluation of eta estimates in typically heterogenous agricultural areas in the absence of flux tower data indirect methods e g peña arancibia et al 2016 can be used for this purpose the cmrset model condenses the richness of the spectral information provided by the two reflective remote sensing indices evi and gvmi which summarise the dynamics of vegetation greenness and wetness additionally providing a way to separate standing water surfaces from soil and vegetation it is possible that the reflective bands that are not used in these two indices could still provide useful information to better estimate eta and potentially provide better model performance a similar argument could be made with the weather information here condensed into the etp using maximum and minimum near surface air temperature and incoming shortwave solar radiation and the use of precipitation given the large number of observations available it is possible that a machine learning approach e g carter and liang 2019 could further improve the use of satellite and weather data to estimate eta additional research should explore this 6 conclusion we recalibrated the cmrset eta model using a dataset of observations of eta from 30 eddy covariance flux towers across australia and five reflectance remotely sensed data products acquired by the modis viirs landsat and sentinel 2 sensors when compared to daily eddy covariance measurements of eta the models had a mean absolute error mae of 0 60 mm d 1 rmse of 0 75 mm d 1 the model was able to detect standing water surfaces and estimate their eta when the model was evaluated over 638 australian catchments it was able to estimate long term water balance by comparing precipitation minus eta with observed streamflow with a mae of 0 33 mm d 1 rmse of 0 47 mm d 1 the results presented here allow the production of field to continental scale estimates of eta using five remote sensing data products these products range from 20 to 30 m pixels acquired every 5 to 16 days i e sentinel 2 landsat to 500 m pixels with daily revisits i e modis and viirs this range of options caters for numerous users allowing for example intra paddock assessments of crop water stress and applications in precision agriculture enhanced understanding of groundwater dependent water use to continental scale assessments of water balance and analysis of decadal trends one limitation is the trade off between spatial resolution vs temporal frequency in remote sensing which could be solved by blending of high spatial low temporal resolution imagery e g sentinel 2 or landsat with low spatial high temporal imagery e g modis or viirs combining landsat and sentinel 2 into a single 20 30 m weekly or better eta also allows for applications in agriculture where resolving intra paddock spatial variability is important compared to alternative eta data product cmrset provides a simpler model structure and more straightforward path to implementation requiring only reflective visible to shortwave infrared satellite data inputs and no need for an ancillary land cover classification with a single set of parameters and no need to manually calibrate to wet and dry pixels like some energy balance algorithms cmrset can estimate eta in areas with substantial direct evaporation such as floodplains lakes and reservoirs these characteristics make cmrset particularly well suited for monitoring agriculture irrigation wetlands and provide critical inputs for assessing structural and policy improvements while the cmrset model was calibrated herein with actual observations of eta from australia only we suggest that this new cmrset model can be applied globally given that numerous studies have successfully deployed cmrset internationally see our introduction further evaluation of model results in other regions with climates and ecosystems not well represented in australia

3758,actual evapotranspiration eta can be estimated using optical remote sensing and meteorological data herein we calibrated and applied the cmrset csiro modis reflectance based scaling evapotranspiration model at the continental scale in australia using five remotely sensed data products with spatial resolutions ranging from 500 m modis viirs 30 m landsat to 20 m sentinel 2 and temporal frequencies ranging from daily modis viirs to multi days landsat and sentinel 2 the five remotely sensed data products were used to compute a crop factor kc based on two vegetation indices which modify priestley taylor potential evapotranspiration estimates etp calculated from nation wide daily meteorological grids to obtain eta cmrset was calibrated using daily latent heat observations from 30 eddy covariance flux towers located across australia representing a wide variety of land covers and climates to ensure that cmrset adequately estimated open water evaporation daily etp estimates at six water sites were also added in the calibration network the calibrated cmrset model was able to estimate daily eta observed at the flux towers with a relative root mean squared error rrmse coefficient of determination r2 ranging between 0 15 0 96 with sentinel 2 to 0 26 0 93 viirs additionally we independently evaluated the performance of cmrset by comparing the long term 5 years or more differences between mean annual precipitation and eta with measured streamflow at 638 unimpaired catchments across australia the comparison showed a rmse of 0 50 mm d 1 rrmse of 0 26 and a r2 of 0 70 the cmrset model performed better than or similarly when compared against two global eta products based on modis optical and thermal data extending the suite of remotely sensed data products that cmrset is calibrated with and using a network of sites located across vast climate and geographic ranges means that cmrset can now be used to estimate eta at continental scales with multiple spatial resolutions and temporal frequencies compared to other available eta products cmrset is more straightforward to operationalise requires less data inputs can capture eta dynamics in areas with significant direct evaporation such as floodplains and lakes and does not require manual calibration to detect wet and dry pixels keywords evapotranspiration remote sensing modis viirs landsat

timestep for the australian continent cmrset used the 16 day composite modis nadir brdf adjusted reflectance nbar product mod43b4 collection 4 to compute a crop factor kc based on two vegetation indices which modify priestley taylor potential evapotranspiration etp calculated from nation wide daily meteorological grids estimates to obtain eta in guerschman et al 2009 the cmrset model was calibrated using monthly latent heat observations converted to eta from 6 eddy covariance flux towers and evaluated by comparing the long term mean difference between precipitation and observed streamflow with the estimated eta in 227 unimpaired australian catchments located mainly in southeastern australia in an objective intercomparison of 8 approaches mainly remotely sensed based to

the underlying accuracy of the ground measurements that they are calibrated to which is 10 to 30 for eddy covariance flux towers glenn et al 2011 additionally compared to guerschman et al 2009 there is now access to more optical sensors e g viirs sentinel 2 and longer time spans particularly with modis and landsat it is also important to provide specific calibrations for each one of these sensors to account for differences in their spectral and radiometric properties it has been observed that sensors spectral and radiometric differences can result in dissimilar vegetation indices e g steven et al 2003 jarchow et al 2018 which can potentially lead to biased results in model estimations the main advantage of cmrset compared to other models which use remotely sensed data is its simplicity from satellite data cmrset only needs surface reflectance data as input and does not require thermal data which are generally of lower spatial resolution than the reflectance bands like in landsat and modis or are absent altogether like in sentinel 2 some other eta models which are based on vegetation indices share this advantage especially in arid or semi arid environments e g nagler et al 2013 2020 cmrset does not need additional information such as a land cover map e g the penman monteith leuning evapotranspiration v2 product pml v2 of zhang et al 2019 or the determination of the hot and cold anchor pixels e g the sebal model bastiaanssen et al 1998a 1998b finally cmrset brings the additional advantage of being able to accurately estimate eta from standing water e g floods and water bodies ranging from large dams to small on farm storages something that eta models based on vegetation indices alone cannot do the goal of this paper is by building on the work of guerschman et al 2009 to provide an eta algorithm that is forthright to implement from field to continental scales and from day to multi day resolutions we do this by i enhancing the spatial resolution and temporal frequency by including sensors other than modis such as viirs landsat and sentinel 2 ii further calibrating cmrset using an enhanced collection of observed eta from eddy covariance flux towers i e 30 flux towers better representing the array of environments and covering a longer timespan and iii evaluating the results using 638 unimpaired catchments distributed across a wider geography and climate zones 2 study site and materials 2 1 australia australia is 7 7 million km2 occupying a latitude range from 10 s to 45 s while predominantly arid and semi arid there are also large areas of temperate and tropical climates supporting heavily forested ecosystems glenn et al 2011 according to the köppen geiger classification system beck et al fig 1 the arid classes those starting with b represent 80 of australia followed by the temperate classes starting with c 12 and the tropical classes starting with a 8 the arid regions are dominated by open grasslands and woodlands scarth et al 2019 with low 30 vegetation cover glenn et al 2011 the tropical regions in the north have open savannas and forests with vegetation cover of 50 or more where precipitation is provided by monsoonal systems which penetrate inland mainly during the austral summer months december to february the temperate regions include grass dominated vegetation and forests thackway and cresswell 1995 and precipitation is provided by both frontal systems and convective events these are the regions where most of the cropping systems are located both rainfed and irrigated for most of the continent precipitation is lower than potential evapotranspiration glenn et al 2011 their fig 1 c and 80 of the precipitation is returned to the atmosphere as eta zhang et al 2016 their fig 4 a with the remainder contributing to groundwater recharge or streamflow 2 2 observed actual evapotranspiration eta measurements of latent heat obtained from 31 eddy covariance towers included in the ozflux network isaac et al 2017 are summarised in table 1 and their locations are shown in fig 1 the observations from each tower were processed using the dynamic integrated gap filling and partitioning for ozflux dingo software as detailed in beringer et al 2017 this includes gap filling of missing observations using artificial neural networks and establishing metrics for diagnosing the surface energy balance closure in the ozflux network 50 of the site years had a surface energy balance ratio of 0 89 or higher and 80 of the sites years had a ratio greater than 0 80 isaac et al 2017 the dingo outputs are hourly or half hourly values at each flux tower we aggregated the latent heat flux observations to a daily mean if at least 20 h of data were available for each day or 40 half hours we converted latent heat from units of energy per area to units of water per time using the conversion factor 28 94 w m 2 1 mm d 1 mean values of eta and time series start and end dates for each ozflux site are provided in table 1 in addition to the eta observations from eddy covariance measurements we estimated potential evapotranspiration etp for six water reservoirs and following zhang et al 2019 assumed that eta etp these reservoirs were located across the continent to sample the variability in climate fig 1 and were large enough to obtain pure surface reflectance data from a 3x3 pixel window of the coarsest sensor i e modis and viirs both with nominal spatial resolutions of 500 m used herein we would have preferred using direct actual evaporation measurements from standing water surfaces but such observations from large enough reservoirs do not exist 2 3 climate data and potential evapotranspiration gridded climate data were obtained from the australian bureau of meteorology bom interpolated climate variables jones et al 2009 these grids cover the australian continent at a spatial resolution of 0 05 approximately 5 km 5 km with a daily timestep and are generated by interpolating observations from weather stations precipitation maximum and minimum air temperature and vapour pressure or from geostationary satellites incoming shortwave solar radiation daily values of precipitation maximum and minimum near surface air temperature and incoming shortwave solar radiation were obtained for each pixel in which the ozflux station or the open water site is located table 1 we derived daily etp using the priestley taylor 1972 formulation which uses the minimum and maximum near surface air temperature and incoming shortwave solar radiation as inputs we calculated the fraction of daylight hours as a function of the day of year and the latitude following forsythe et al 1995 the python code used to calculate etp is provided in the supplementary material mean values of etp and precipitation for each site corresponding to the period with available flux tower eta data are provided in table 1 it is noted that while there are etp or reference et products which use more complex formulations in australia priestley taylor etp has proven consistent when compared to more complex formulations in selected sites in australia chiew and leahy 2003 after careful analysis of the daily eta etp and precipitation values in each flux tower we decided to eliminate the cow bay site 16 2382s 145 4272w this site is in close proximity to the coast has a high local relative relief driving strong orthographic precipitation gradients and low density of nearby precipitation gauges for the spatial interpolation algorithm we performed the analyses with data from 30 flux towers 2 4 satellite data 2 4 1 modis 2 4 1 1 mcd43a4 we used the nadir bidirectional reflectance distribution function adjusted reflectance nbar product from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis sensor collection 6 schaaf and wang 2015 which has the specific product code mcd43a4 this product provides a rolling daily 16 day composite surface reflectance weighted to retrieve the value on the ninth day of the 16 day period all cloud free observations in the 16 day compositing period from both the terra morning overpass and aqua afternoon overpass satellites carrying the modis sensor were used to derive the nbar surface reflectance for each pixel mcd43a4 has a spatial resolution of 500 m and is available from 18 feb 2000 the uncertainties in the product are well characterised via independent measurements in a systematic and statistically robust way representing global conditions wang et al 2018 mcd43a4 includes four bands in the visible near infrared region and three bands in the shortwave infrared mcd43a4 data were accessed from google earth engine gee gorelick et al 2017 2 4 1 2 mod09a1 this product provides an estimate of the daily surface spectral reflectance of terra morning overpass from the modis sensor for the same seven bands as mcd43a4 corrected for atmospheric conditions vermote 2015 for each pixel a value is selected from all the acquisitions within the 8 day composite period based on quality control criteria including cloud and solar zenith angles when several acquisitions meet the criteria the pixel with the minimum blue reflectance is used unlike mcd43a4 mod09a1 is not corrected for bidirectional reflectance distribution function effects potentially introducing errors in products derived from surface reflectance products such as eta our motivation for calibrating the cmrset algorithm using mod09a1 is that the same algorithm is used to generate a near real time modis product mod09 nrt 006 therefore making it possible to deliver cmrset eta estimates in near real time mod09a1 includes the same 7 reflective bands as mcd43a4 at 500 m resolution and is available from 24 feb 2000 mod09a1 data were accessed from gee 2 4 2 viirs the visible infrared imaging radiometer suite viirs daily surface reflectance vnp09ga justice et al 2013 product provides an estimate of daily land surface reflectance from the suomi national polar orbiting partnership s npp viirs sensor data are provided for three bands at nominal 500 m 463 m resolution and nine moderate resolution bands at nominal 1 km 926 m resolution these bands are corrected for atmospheric conditions to provide an estimate of the surface spectral reflectance justice et al 2013 the data are temporally aggregated over each of the 16 possible passes per day when multiple observations are present for each day only the first of the highest quality observations is included vnp09ga data were accessed from gee and are available from 19 jan 2012 2 4 3 landsat atmospherically corrected surface reflectance collection 2 level 2 tier 1 from the tm etm and oli sensors from the landsat 5 7 and 8 satellites respectively were accessed from gee usgs 2021a and 2021b reflectance values from the tm on landsat 5 and etm on landsat 7 sensors were harmonised to the oli sensor on landsat 8 using the empirical functions from roy et al 2016 these images contain four visible and near infrared bands vnir and two short wave infrared swir bands processed to orthorectified surface reflectance the vnir and swir bands have a resolution of 30 m these data have been atmospherically corrected using ledaps usgs 2020 and include a cloud shadow water and snow mask produced using cfmask foga et al 2017 as well as a per pixel saturation mask landsat tm data are available on gee from march 1984 yet due to a limited number of flux towers operating pre 2000 see table 1 we limit the landsat analysis from 01 feb 2000 i e the same timespan as the two modis products used here 2 4 4 sentinel 2 data from the multispectral instrument sensor onboard the sentinel 2a and sentinel 2b satellites drusch et al 2012 were obtained from the digital earth australia dea database we did not source sentinel 2 data from gee because the level 2a orthorectified atmospherically corrected surface reflectance available in gee for australia was not available before 01 dec 2018 dea in contrast includes corrected surface reflectance data from sentinel 2 since the beginning of the sentinel 2 record on 12 jul 2015 dea applies nbar correction which involves atmospheric correction to compute bottom of atmosphere radiance and bi directional reflectance modelling to remove the effects of topography and sun target sensor angular variation in reflectance following li et al 2010 2012 a full description of the data product and processing can be found in https cmi ga gov au data products dea 190 surface reflectance nbart 1 sentinel 2 msi accessed 24 nov 2021 surface reflectance for the s2a ard granule and s2b ard granule was sourced for all the sentinel 2 bands available this includes eight visible near infrared bands at 10 or 20 m resolution and two shortwave infrared bands at 20 m resolution dea applied a cloud masking algorithm coluzzi et al 2018 to all sentinel 2 imagery however due to sub optimal performance of such algorithm likely due to sentinel 2 not having thermal capacity per chen et al 2021 we visually inspected all sentinel 2 images extracted for the sites listed in table 1 and excluded all sentinel 2 images affected by clouds or cloud shadows 2 5 catchment streamflow data we obtained streamflow q data from the australian bureau of meteorology bom for 780 unregulated and unimpaired catchments i e not significantly affected by regulation structures or streamflow extraction in australia based on zhang et al 2013 this dataset includes daily end of catchment streamflow ml d 1 catchment boundaries updated using bom s geofabric v3 2 beta and relevant catchment attributes http www bom gov au water geofabric download shtml accessed 16 nov 2021 this dataset has been used for calibrating and evaluating hydrological and landscape models in australia and globally zhang et al 2016 ukkola et al 2016 tian et al 2019 we further refined the datasets by i calculating mean monthly streamflow discarding months with less than 25 daily observations and ii discarding catchments with less than 60 months 5 years of data the resulting dataset includes 638 catchments fig 1 which were later used for evaluating the eta model performance by estimating the long term catchment water balance that is et a p q for each catchment we calculated mean daily precipitation from the bom interpolated climate grids introduced above 3 methods 3 1 the cmrset model the csiro modis reflectance based scaling evapotranspiration cmrset developed by guerschman et al 2009 was recalibrated using more up to date modis imagery herein and calibrated for the first time using viirs landsat and sentinel 2 using a crop factor approach allen 2000 cmrset uses two reflective remotely sensed indices to scale etp to eta cmrset also uses a scaling factor to account for interception i e evaporation from vegetation surfaces during and just after precipitation events the indices calculated from reflectance data are the enhanced vegetation index evi huete et al 2002 and the global vegetation moisture index gvmi ceccato et al 2002b a 1 evi g ρ nir ρ red ρ nir c 1 ρ red c 2 ρ blue l 2 gvmi ρ nir 0 1 ρ swir 0 02 ρ nir 0 1 ρ swir 0 02 where ρred ρnir ρblue and ρswir are the reflectances in red near infrared blue and shortwave infrared bands respectively to calculate evi g c1 c2 and l are parameters that account for aerosol scattering and absorption and their values are 2 5 6 7 5 and 1 respectively huete et al 1994 huete et al 1997 table 2 shows which bands were used from each of the five remote sensing data products to calculate evi and gvmi herein evi is rescaled to a value between 0 and 1 following 3 evi r m i n m a x evi evi min evi max evi min 0 0 9 where evimin 0 and evimax 0 9 evir is capped at 0 when evi evimin and capped at 0 9 when evi evimax a residual moisture index rmi is calculated combining evi and gvmi as 4 rmi m a x g v m i k rmi e v i c rmi 0 where k rmi and c rmi are parameters fitted during model calibration the rmi represents the distance in the gvmi axis to the line determined by the k rmi and c rmi parameters the rationale behind this is that evi provides the signal form the vegetation vigour and the rmi adds information on the vegetation structure by separating vegetation types with the same evi and it also provides a metric to identify open water surfaces the combined use of evi and gvmi in this index improves the model performance as the vegetation moisture content can be used as a surrogate for canopy conductance and because open water surfaces can be separated from bare soil and vegetation actual evapotranspiration et a is estimated in cmrset as 5 et a k c et p k ei p where k c is the crop factor that represents the ratio of actual to potential evapotranspiration similar to the fao k in allen 2000 k ei represents interception fraction of p and p is precipitation in cmrset et p and p are obtained from the bom interpolated climate grids jones et al 2009 the interception term k ei is linearly related to the rescaled enhanced vegetation index evir as 6 k ei k ei max evi r where k ei max is a parameter fitted during model calibration the crop factor term kc is calculated as 7 k c k c max 1 e a e v i r α b r m i β where k c max is a parameter fitted during model calibration which is multiplied by a sigmoidal function that depends simultaneously on the evir and rmi and a α b and β are also parameters fitted during model calibration during model calibration constraints or bounds were placed on the parameter ranges to ensure that the final parameter set was physically meaningful these parameter calibration ranges are reported in table s1 in summary cmrset requires the evi and gvmi indices from remotely sensed data et p and p from interpolated climate grids and returns eta using 8 parameters 3 2 pre processing of satellite data in eddy covariance measurements the footprint of the instrument i e the area contributing to the recorded energy and matter fluxes is a function of several factors including height of the instrument surface roughness wind speed and wind direction göckede et al 2004 rebmann et al 2005 a commonly used heuristic rule indicates that approximately 75 of the flux derives from an area bound by an upwind distance that is between 20 and 30 times the effective measurement height arriga et al 2017 following this principle we extracted median reflectance for each band and each sensor on all available images using a circular area around each ozflux tower of radius equal to 30 times the instrument height table 1 we included all cloud free pixels with centroid located inside the circular footprint for the six open water sites table 1 we used a circle of 300 m radius using the median reflectance values from these areas we then derived the evi and gvmi indices for each day with reflectance and eta measurements we calculated the mean eta etp and p from the pixels overlying the tower by averaging the 7 days centered in the day of satellite overpass or the middle day of the composite period for mcd43a4 mod09a1 and vnp09ga in this way the observed conditions are averaged for a week centered on the satellite overpass for the modis and viirs products this 7 day mean represents the average eta and climatic conditions of the period for which the reflectance is averaged in the case of landsat and sentinel 2 imagery even though they observe the surface on a specific date as most land surface conditions captured by reflective remote sensing change gradually through time using a 7 day eta etp and p mean is more appropriate than using the observations for the specific date of satellite overpass as a result of this process cmrset is effectively estimating the eta of the daily conditions smoothed over a 7 day period 3 3 model calibration the cmrset model was calibrated by searching for the values of the parameters that minimised the objective function 8 j et a o ij et a m ij 2 where et a o ij and et a m ij are the observed and modelled eta in the site i and 7 day mean on day j respectively this means that all sites were pooled during model calibration eight parameters were calibrated being k c max a α b β k ei max k rmi and c rmi the total number of observations i j varied according to the specific remotely sensed data product depending on frequency of observation cloud conditions and date when the product commenced all sites and dates pooled together i j were used for model calibration to test whether the inclusion of the open water sites produced a substantial change on the estimated parameters and model performance in the ozflux sites we repeated the calibration procedure excluding these sites we used the trust region reflective optimisation algorithm implemented in the least squares routine of python s scipy v 1 5 2 the initial values for the parameters were those of the calibrated model of guerschman et al 2009 the resulting model parameters for the five remote sensing products and initial set of parameter bounds used for calibrating all remote sensing products are reported in table s1 these five remote sensing product specific parameter sets define cmrset v2 version 2 with cmrset v1 being the parameter set reported in guerschman et al 2009 that is specific for the modis collection 4 product denoted mod43b4 to test the sensitivity of the model parameters to the addition of specific sites or sites from a particular köppen geiger class beck et al 2018 or ecoregion olson et al 2001 we performed three bootstrap or jack knifing cross calibrations in each iteration the data from a particular site from all sites of a particular köppen geiger class or from all sites of a particular ecoregion were removed from the dataset then the model was calibrated and finally applied to the site s which had been removed we then compared the differences in the et a m ij obtained at the site s without removing them the following evaluation metrics were used following richter et al 2011 i the coefficient of determination r2 of a fitted linear regression between observed and modelled data which reflects temporal correlation it is bound between 0 0 and 1 0 with r2 0 9 indicating excellent correlation 0 8 r2 0 9 indicating very good correlation and 0 5 r2 0 8 indicating good correlation ii the root mean squared error rmse and mean absolute error mae which indicates magnitude of error the closer the rmse or mae value to 0 the more accurate the model is iii the relative root mean squared error rrmse and mean absolute error rmae which indicate magnitude of error relative to the mean with rrmse 0 1 indicating excellent accuracy and 0 2 rrmse 0 3 indicating good accuracy rrmse calculated as rmse divided by the mean of the observations 3 4 model evaluation we tested the model performance by applying the modelled eta obtained with the daily modis nbar product mcd43a4 to all pixels in the 638 unimpaired catchments with streamflow q data these data are independent of the data used for model calibration and used here for model evaluation following oreskes et al 1994 we avoid using the terms validation or verification we selected the mcd43a4 product as it has a long record i e greater than 20 years unlike viirs and sentinel 2 and continuous gap free data unlike landsat the resulting daily eta was paired to the daily observed q and p and aggregated to long term mean in the same way as with q i e discarding the eta and p estimates when q data was missing calculating monthly eta and p if the month included at least 25 daily q values and then calculating long term mean eta e t a and mean p p if at least 60 monthly values were available we then compared i net excess precipitation p e t a with streamflow q and ii p q with et a the assumption made in this evaluation is that by averaging over at least 5 years of q data the effects of differences between the initial and final amount of stored water were minimised i e groundwater and soil moisture in the catchment han et al 2020 3 5 comparison with global eta products we compared the performance of the calibrated cmrset model with two satellite driven eta global products the modis terra net evapotranspiration 8 day global mod16a2 collection 006 mu et al 2011 running et al 2017 combines reflective data from the modis sensor and global meteorological observations to provide eta and etp at 500 m resolution mod16a2 uses leaf area index lai albedo and land cover data derived from modis products with meteorological variables from interpolated global climate data as inputs into a model based on the penman monteith method cleugh et al 2007 and calculates canopy conductance and eta the penman monteith leuning evapotranspiration v2 product pml v2 zhang et al 2019 also provides global eta coupled with gross primary product at 500 m resolution and 8 day intervals pml v2 combines modis leaf area index and albedo both derived from reflective modis data and modis emissivity thermal data we obtained the eta values estimated by mod16a2 and pml v2 for the ozflux and water sites in the same way as performed for the surface reflectance cmrset inputs as described above we also obtained the mean eta values from mod16a2 and pml v2 for the 638 catchments used for cmrset model evaluation the eta products used in this comparison were the only two available at the modis resolution or better 500 m and available globally therefore allowing us to compare with our modis driven cmrset model in australia additionally pml v2 has been calibrated with flux towers and evaluated with long term catchment water balance in a similar way to our approach and compared favorably to mod16a2 and to the gleam model of martens et al 2017 3 6 assessment of spatiotemporal model performance we used google earth engine gorelick et al 2017 to apply the best model calibration for each data product and obtain spatial estimates of eta across the australian continent the interpolated daily climate grids were uploaded to google servers and used within the earth engine code editor environment the assessment was performed visually by comparing cmrset s eta estimates at different resolutions and in different geographical locations and under different land cover conditions we focused in areas with i recurrent flood inundation ii complex hydromorphology and iii a mosaiced landscape with a mixture of irrigated agriculture and native vegetation 4 results 4 1 model calibration when assessing the optimised cmrset models with daily flux tower observations of eta the root mean squared error rmse ranged between 0 47 mm d 1 with sentinel 2 to 0 60 mm d 1 vnp09ga table 3 these values represent a relative rmse rrmse of 0 16 sentinel 2 to 0 26 vnp09ga the coefficient of determination r2 ranged from a maximum of 0 96 sentinel 2 to a minimum of 0 93 viirs the performance of cmrset with the two modis products and landsat was similar with rmse rrmse and r2 around 0 63 mm d 1 0 21 and 0 93 respectively see table 3 all the water sites had an excellent fit r2 higher than 0 9 and rrmse lower than 0 05 between estimated and observed eta assumed equal to etp this indicates that the evi and gvmi indices derived from the reflective satellite data were successful in detecting standing water we stress that these water sites do not have actual measurement of evaporation the eta was assumed equal to the etp for this reason we also report the results if these water sites are not included in statistics for the 30 flux tower sites pooled together the rmse ranged between 0 60 and 0 76 mm d 1 rrmse of 0 38 0 48 and the r2 between 0 62 and 0 73 including the water sites in the calibration improved the performance indicators to further test the sensitivity of cmrset to the inclusion of the water sites we repeated the calibration with those six sites removed the model performance for individual sites did not change greatly between the five satellite products used and also importantly they were not overly affected by inclusion or exclusion of these six water sites in the calibration process fig 2 and fig s1 to fig s5 the sites in the temperate wet köppen geiger class green symbols in fig 2 had the best model performance with correlations of 0 7 and higher and no substantial bias the sites in the tropical köppen geiger class light blue symbols in fig 2 also showed high correlation 0 7 and higher and a lower range of modelled eta compared to the observed the two sites in the temperate dry köppen geiger classes yellow symbols in fig 2 had also lower correlation 0 2 to 0 5 and a higher range of modelled eta compared to the observed sites in the arid dry köppen geiger classes red symbols in fig 2 had more variable performance with correlations between 0 14 and 0 7 depending on site and sensor used and no clear pattern in relation to modelled and observed range in eta importantly results from the bootstrapping exercise showed that no site changed its model performance when the site was not used for model calibration fig s6 when all sites of a particular köppen geiger class were excluded from the calibration the resultant eta estimates were much worse for the six water sites and also the r2 decreased for the sites located in the bwh arid desert hot climate class fig s7 4 2 model evaluation when long term catchment mean estimated eta was compared to the difference between long term catchment mean precipitation and long term catchment mean streamflow in 638 catchments the two variables showed an rmse of 0 50 mm d 1 mae 0 31 mm d 1 and a r2 of 0 27 these results were obtained with the calibration using all flux tower and water sites and the mcd43a4 product when the comparison was made between net excess precipitation p e t a and streamflow q the rmse and mae was the same and the r2 was 0 70 due to the correlation between p and q fig 3 the mean p q and et a were 1 93 and 1 76 mm d 1 respectively there was no apparent bias between catchments driven by köppen geiger climate classes four catchments in the arid climate zone with very low mean streamflow had a modelled et a higher than p of up to 2 mm d 1 the r2 between monthly p et a and q was high 0 6 in catchments with a high seasonal variability in p irrespective of the long term mean q q this included catchments in the northern monsoonal part of australia the coastal regions of qld and nsw and in tasmania fig 4 r2 was lower 0 6 in drier catchments of southern australia 4 3 comparison with global eta products the calibrated cmrset model using the mcd43a4 product performed consistently better than the mod16a2 product mu et al 2011 running et al 2017 and slightly better than the pml v2 product zhang et al 2019 when comparing against the observed eta at the 30 ozflux sites fig 5 and fig s9 the mod16a2 product does not provide eta estimates over permanent water bodies values are masked and the pml v2 product assumes similar to cmrset eta to be equal to etp calculated with the penman monteith method because we do not have eta observations from suitably large water bodies we did not include those in the comparison between cmrset and pml v2 either the comparison between cmrset mod16a2 and pml v2 for the 638 unimpaired catchments showed similar results to the comparison performed using the ozflux sites cmrset performed substantially better than mod16a2 and very similar to pml v2 fig 6 in this case pml v2 was slightly better in estimating long term water balance than cmrset lower mae rmse and higher r2 4 4 spatiotemporal model performance fig 7 shows the eta estimated using mcd43a4 for all australia for 12 nov 2019 when evaporative demand starts increasing in the late austral spring months three insets in fig 7 illustrate alternative spatial patterns captured by each of the five input remotely sensed data products in the first inset flooding which occurred on 14 feb 2019 in the gulf plains is captured by the five data products and standing water shows high 7 mm d 1 evaporation rates the area that is not under water corresponds to a mosaic of tropical savannas and grasslands and shows eta values between 1 and 6 mm d 1 the second inset corresponds to 15 aug 2019 in the cooper diamantina plains region in the channel country an intricate mosaic of riparian wetlands waterholes and arid shrublands eta values range from 0 mm d 1 in the arid shrublands to 2 3 mm d 1 in the riparian wetlands and exceed 4 mm d 1 in the waterholes the third inset shows also an intricate complex spatial pattern of rainfed and irrigated crops riparian vegetation and standing water in the murrumbidgee region at the onset of the summer irrigation season on 12 nov 2019 when summer irrigated crops coexist with rainfed perennial pastures again the eta estimated by cmrset illustrates that this range of land cover types exhibit different water use rates a dynamic monthly version of the modis landsat and viirs maps presented in this paper are viewable online from https tern landscapes earthengine app view aet datasets 5 discussion we calibrated guerschman et al s 2009 cmrset model using a wider selection of remotely sensed data products and a much larger collection of on ground measurements of eta and in this way better represented the array of environmental conditions in australia summarised in table 4 when using mcd43a4 we achieved a rmse of 0 62 mm d 1 equivalent to 18 9 mm month 1 table 3 this is similar to that obtained in the initial calibration of cmrset see table 2 in guerschman et al 2009 with two important differences firstly the eta estimates herein are at the daily time step whereas the original cmrset was calibrated and applied at the monthly time step secondly cmrset was previously calibrated for modis only and as the vegetation indices used in cmrset require more than just the modis 250 m red and nir bands its spatial resolution was limited to 500 m in contrast as implemented herein both sentinel 2 20 m and landsat 30 m cmrset estimates can now be generated here the performance of the individual flux tower sites ranged from a maximum rmse of 1 8 mm d 1 in fogg dam to a minimum of 0 4 mm d 1 dargo with the vast majority i e 27 of 30 of the ozflux sites reported a rmse in the range of 0 5 1 1 mm d 1 table 3 and fig s6 cmrset eta estimated at the sites in the temperate köppen geiger class had the best correlation and least bias table 3 fig 2 and fig s1 to fig s5 the sites in the tropical class also tended to have high correlation but cmrset captured less of the seasonal variability in eta the sites in the arid class tended to have eta estimated with the lowest correlation the agreement between observed eta and cmrset s eta estimation is a combination of the etp driven by interpolated climate data and the kc governed by the remote sensing inputs the temperate and tropical areas are highly seasonal with a well defined growing season limited by either temperature water or both in those regions etp captures such seasonality and that already provides a high correlation between observed and estimated eta also explaining the lower correlation in the arid and temperate hot climate classes whether cmrset also captures the magnitude of this seasonal signal depends on the specifics of each site and is governed by the dynamics of the vegetation and how well these dynamics are captured by vegetation indices used in cmrset for example in four tropical savanna sites with a strong signal from the grassy component i e adelaide river daly river pasture daly river uncleared and dry river cmrset overestimated eta during the dry season possibly caused by the evi not dropping to very low values despite the very low observed eta fig s1 to fig s5 a local calibration of cmrset only using these sites or sites from any other region could potentially improve the performance of the model in those environments it is also possible that cmrset based on reflective data alone does not adequately capture water stress during the dry season in these environments an alternative formulation which uses surface thermal data and or remotely sensed soil moisture kalma et al 2008 bastiaanssen et al 2012 could potentially help overcome this issue but at the same time make cmrset more difficult to implement the temporal scale of aggregation influences the magnitude of the prediction error generally decreasing as longer time steps are considered fig 8 the median percent error at the weekly scale was 27 2 which decreased to 11 7 when mean annual eta was considered over the 638 unimpaired catchments with 5 or more years of q data the calibrated cmrset model was able to estimate long term water balance comparing et a with p q with a median percent error of 13 8 fig 8 incorporating water sites in the calibration where eta was assumed to be equal to etp ensured that the new cmrset parameters continue to be able to estimate open water evaporation accurately this is one of the advantages of cmrset as traditional vegetation index based methods fail to estimate open water evaporation well glenn et al 2010 which therefore limits their utility to provide accurate eta estimates across the entire landscape for use in catchment scale water accounting in cmrset the combined use of evi and gvmi achieves this and avoids the need to use an ancillary and usually static land cover map to detect standing water which is very dynamic in large parts of australia such as in floodplains and reservoirs see fig 9 in mueller et al 2015 the vegetation indices used by cmrset equation 4 internally separate water and other types of surface cover peña arancibia et al 2021 the inclusion of the water sites did not cause any degradation in the performance of cmrset on the flux tower sites fig 2 if the water sites were not used in contrast the ability of cmrset to estimate open water evaporation was degraded rmse changing from 0 3 to 2 5 mm d 1 and r2 decreasing from 0 98 to 0 80 fig s7 to avoid making the eta equals etp assumption an impoundment water balance can be used for typically monitored water sites like reservoirs to calculate eta inflows e g streamflow from contributing catchments and precipitation over the water surface and outflows i e dam releases along with changes in the water storage depth and possibly also accounting for changes in water surface area as a function of water depth are routinely monitored in australia s supply reservoirs to estimate a water resources assessment ndpie 2021 while there would be some uncertainty in such calculations as examples water levels responding to wind push and unknown amounts of groundwater recharge from the reservoir these calculations would likely provide suitable eta estimates for future calibration exercises another important advantage of the new model calibration reported herein is that the five remote sensing based data products used sensors ranging from coarse 500 m resolution to the sentinel 2 sensor with 20 m spatial resolution when using the different sensors the overall performance of cmrset was similar table 3 fig 2 and fig s1 to fig s5 with the exception of sentinel 2 which showed better performance lower rmse as sentinel 2 only started in 12 jul 2015 there are many less concurrent eta and sentinel 2 observations and several flux tower sites did not have in situ observations available post 2016 i e the flux tower had already closed therefore the enhanced performance of sentinel 2 does not necessarily indicate improved eta estimation with sentinel 2 in all conditions when applied to the five remote sensing data products the recalibrated cmrset model was able to capture spatial patterns of eta at the continental scale to fine resolution features at the field scale fig 7 the range of sensors used here provide users with a large array of alternatives regarding spatial resolution from 20 m sentinel 2 to 500 m in modis or viirs temporal revisit daily for modis viirs through 5 days for sentinel 2 to 16 days for landsat and temporal coverage from 1987 for landsat 5 7 and 8 combined 2000 for modis 2012 for viirs and 2016 for sentinel 2 cloud cover in turn adds an additional constraint to the availability of useful optical remotely sensed data whitcraft et al 2015 wilson and jetz 2016 the degree of cloud contamination is a function of the geographical location as it depends on the climate patterns e g monsoon season in the tropics we quantified the availability of cloud free images in each site for each data product and a clear seasonal pattern emerged fig s10 in the tropical sites located in northern australia the availability of cloud free imagery during the austral summer the wet season dropped to almost half of that observed in the austral winter the dry season the pattern was inverted in the temperate sites located in southern australia that experience relatively warm cloud free austral summers with the availability of cloud free imagery decreasing in the austral winter no single data product though can efficiently cater for all possible uses as spatial resolution tends to be inversely correlated with temporal revisit time further research is needed to explore alternatives for blending these data products and the cmrset eta estimates to produce high frequency high resolution products to satisfy the needs of many potential users e g jarihani et al 2014 chen et al 2020 given the gaps that exist in the high resolution i e landsat and sentinel 2 imagery when cloud is considered see table s3 the recalibrated cmrset model using the mcd43a4 data product was evaluated with an independent dataset of observed streamflow from 638 catchments the model estimated catchment water balance i e p q with a rmse of 0 47 mm d 1 equivalent to 171 mm y 1 fig 3 this is somewhat higher than a similar evaluation performed in the first version of cmrset over 227 catchments guerschman et al 2009 a subset of those used here rmse 137 mm y 1 the additional 411 catchments included to the streamflow dataset were mainly located in northern territory and western australia in the arid and tropical köppen geiger zones and are generally much larger catchments than the catchments used in the earlier cmrset calibration paper compare fig 1 here with fig 1 in guerschman et al 2009 in these catchments during large flood events streamflow can exceed the calibration ranges of streamflow rating curves and make q estimates more uncertain scarm 2000 additionally these catchments were in areas with sparse gauging networks and rainfall events can be convective and of short duration making p estimates more uncertain jones et al 2009 their fig 2 a the two factors are likely the cause of the apparent decrease in accuracy when evaluating the catchment water balance with cmrset the cmrset model calibrated here using mcd43a4 showed a much better performance than the modis land eta product mod16a2 when compared to the ozflux data and when compared to long term catchment water balance fig 5 compared to zhang et al s 2019 pml v2 product cmrset had very similar performance at the 30 ozflux sites and provided marginally worse long term catchment water balance statistics the pml v2 model like cmrset was calibrated using a global dataset of 95 eddy covariance flux towers 16 of the 30 used herein were used in zhang et al 2019 and uses surface emissivity data from modis in addition to leaf area index and albedo derived from reflective bands cmrset was able to achieve a similar or better degree of accuracy with a simpler model structure and data input needs it should be noted that the flux tower eta data used in this study correspond mainly to natural i e where there is no agriculture or other anthropogenic management land covers in addition the water balance evaluation was performed for catchments largely undisturbed i e by regulation or water withdrawals for agriculture or other uses peña arancibia et al 2021 evaluated the cmrset model parameterised as in guerschman et al 2009 in irrigated areas in southeast australia the evaluation was performed by comparing cmrset against two routinely used remotely sensed crop factor eta models and the results showed that cmrset compared well in both magnitude and temporal patterns while we have not explicitly evaluated the current parameterisation of cmrset in agricultural sites the similar catchment water balance results of this version of cmrset when compared to the guerschman et al 2009 cmrset version suggest that there are no large biases at the multi annual scale and hence results should also be similar in agricultural areas the parameterisation of cmrset with landsat and sentinel 2 products enables the evaluation of eta estimates in typically heterogenous agricultural areas in the absence of flux tower data indirect methods e g peña arancibia et al 2016 can be used for this purpose the cmrset model condenses the richness of the spectral information provided by the two reflective remote sensing indices evi and gvmi which summarise the dynamics of vegetation greenness and wetness additionally providing a way to separate standing water surfaces from soil and vegetation it is possible that the reflective bands that are not used in these two indices could still provide useful information to better estimate eta and potentially provide better model performance a similar argument could be made with the weather information here condensed into the etp using maximum and minimum near surface air temperature and incoming shortwave solar radiation and the use of precipitation given the large number of observations available it is possible that a machine learning approach e g carter and liang 2019 could further improve the use of satellite and weather data to estimate eta additional research should explore this 6 conclusion we recalibrated the cmrset eta model using a dataset of observations of eta from 30 eddy covariance flux towers across australia and five reflectance remotely sensed data products acquired by the modis viirs landsat and sentinel 2 sensors when compared to daily eddy covariance measurements of eta the models had a mean absolute error mae of 0 60 mm d 1 rmse of 0 75 mm d 1 the model was able to detect standing water surfaces and estimate their eta when the model was evaluated over 638 australian catchments it was able to estimate long term water balance by comparing precipitation minus eta with observed streamflow with a mae of 0 33 mm d 1 rmse of 0 47 mm d 1 the results presented here allow the production of field to continental scale estimates of eta using five remote sensing data products these products range from 20 to 30 m pixels acquired every 5 to 16 days i e sentinel 2 landsat to 500 m pixels with daily revisits i e modis and viirs this range of options caters for numerous users allowing for example intra paddock assessments of crop water stress and applications in precision agriculture enhanced understanding of groundwater dependent water use to continental scale assessments of water balance and analysis of decadal trends one limitation is the trade off between spatial resolution vs temporal frequency in remote sensing which could be solved by blending of high spatial low temporal resolution imagery e g sentinel 2 or landsat with low spatial high temporal imagery e g modis or viirs combining landsat and sentinel 2 into a single 20 30 m weekly or better eta also allows for applications in agriculture where resolving intra paddock spatial variability is important compared to alternative eta data product cmrset provides a simpler model structure and more straightforward path to implementation requiring only reflective visible to shortwave infrared satellite data inputs and no need for an ancillary land cover classification with a single set of parameters and no need to manually calibrate to wet and dry pixels like some energy balance algorithms cmrset can estimate eta in areas with substantial direct evaporation such as floodplains lakes and reservoirs these characteristics make cmrset particularly well suited for monitoring agriculture irrigation wetlands and provide critical inputs for assessing structural and policy improvements while the cmrset model was calibrated herein with actual observations of eta from australia only we suggest that this new cmrset model can be applied globally given that numerous studies have successfully deployed cmrset internationally see our introduction further evaluation of model results in other regions with climates and ecosystems not well represented in australia

when used separately can consider a specific prioritization for the solutions and the proposed scenarios nor can provide a comprehensive view of the system from the past to the future therefore the unique combination of the dpsir and gof frameworks in this study is used to conceptualize and evaluate the aquifer system from the past to the future considering the environmental economic and social dimensions of sustainable development to implement this combined approach hydrological data groundwater level evaporation rate precipitation rate temperature rate etc and economic and social data population rate employment status income level literacy level etc were used after identifying the links and dimensions of the dpsir gof framework some scenarios are proposed to improve the aquifer s state furthermore evaluation indicators including technical indicators aquifer sustainability and dryness and economic indicators productivity and cost benefit analysis are used to determine the performance of management scenarios and prioritize their effectiveness in restoring and sustaining the aquifer finally the scenarios of 5 r1 and 10 r2 reduction in groundwater exploitation as well as 10 c1 and 20 c2 reduction of cultivated area were introduced results show that a decrease in exploitations over 30 years effectively maintained the aquifer balance in all four scenarios scenario r2 with crop per drop benefit per drop and cba of 1 62 9 3 and 0 39 respectively was preferred to other scenarios during the 30 years of the simulation period based on a 41 year sustainability index scenario r2 performed better in reducing the impact of drought than other scenarios sources of uncertainties involved in this study were hydrological data including aquifer inputs and outputs

dimensions of sustainable development environmental economic and social united nations 2015 roberts and colwell 2001 burchell and lightfoot 2004 which the dpsir framework cannot be used in this process hermanowicz 2008 alkan olsson et al 2009 alkan olsson et al 2007 marzieh samareh hashemi et al 2019 there is a critical need to use other tools with this framework to achieve an integrated and comprehensive period past present and future of the aquifer system an assessment need to identify the effects of future decisions and policies on the current and future state of water resources systems a goal oriented framework gof can complement the assessments alongside the dpsir framework in addition to possible future changes the gof can evaluate the system from three main dimensions of sustainable development economic social and environmental the gof is a tool designed to conduct integrated assessments to determine the impact of new policies and technologies on agricultural systems and the impact of agricultural systems on the rest of the world van ittersum et al 2008 alkan olsson et al 2009 alkan olsson et al 2007 furthermore it has often been used in urban sustainability studies cabot et al 2009 mahaux et al 2011 a study also used gof to develop a strategy to identify the characteristics and value of a river to human life and its relationships with the environment in this study the grounded group decision making ggdm method was used to validate the developed strategies shafaghat et al 2017 for a sustainable and comprehensive evaluation of water resources systems it is necessary to consider the present and future states and the past hermanowicz 2008 the simultaneous use of dpsir and gof frameworks can fill this need by considering all periods in the past present and future to assess the impacts of policies for example in a study on the khorasan region of iran both frameworks were used to identify all the variables affecting the water resources system and conceptualize it entirely with the full coverage of the time dimension this combined framework helps stakeholders easily identify key variables that should be considered for efficient modeling in system analysis marzieh samareh hashemi et al 2019 a literature review shows that both dpsir and gof frameworks used individually do not consider a specific prioritization for the proposed solutions and cannot individually determine the impact of responses on complex systems robele gari et al 2015 rasi nezami et al 2013 more specifically these frameworks do not have the capability of validating scenarios and determining their effects in complex water resource systems including aquifers on the other hand dpsir and gof frameworks have not been used simultaneously to assess the sustainability and management of groundwater resources and aquifers therefore in some studies analytical methods such as multi criteria decision making mcdm malekmohammadi and jahanishakib 2017 analytic hierarchy process ahp liu et al 2018 sun et al 2016 and structural equation models have been used along with either of these frameworks to prioritize the effect of approaches and calculate the weight of indicators sun et al 2018 in the current study a combination of dpsir and gof frameworks has been used to conceptualize and evaluate the aquifer system for the first time in groundwater literature evaluation indicators have also been used to identify the performance of management scenarios and prioritize their effectiveness in maintaining aquifer sustainability to prevent environmental economic and social problems and maintain economic and social security in the future which is another innovation of this study in other words for the first time in this study after the conceptualizing processes using the dpsir gof model economic and technical tools are used to investigate the impact of each management approach on groundwater levels solving the problems of complex systems of water resources including aquifers requires considering the technical and economic effects of the proposed solutions mayer and muñoz hernandez 2009 therefore two essential indicators are used in this study technical indicators included are sustainable development index and aquifer dryness which indicate the aquifer s performance under the influence of over exploitation and the amount of aquifer local dryness due to over exploitation respectively martin carrasco et al 2012 sheikhipour et al 2018 moreover productivity and cost benefit analysis cba are used as two indicators to determine the impacts of approaches on the economic situation and consequently maintain economic and social balance and security these two indicators analyze water use efficiency at different levels of agriculture and compare the ratio of revenue and costs respectively nickel et al 2009 molden 1997 the aquifer s numerical simulation is required to calculate some parameters such as groundwater level aquifer volume and storage coefficient changes thus the najafabad aquifer was simulated using the modflow model harbaugh 2005 by applying the combined model of dpsir gof and analyzing the impact of policies using the indicators the effects of approaches on maintaining the sustainability and balance of groundwater level of the aquifer and advancing the economic and social situation of the region in the agricultural sector were determined to obtain sustainable groundwater system and maintain economic and social security in other words based on the results of combining both frameworks analyzing the effects of scenarios and adopting the selected policy an important step can be taken in enhancing the storage and recovery of complex groundwater systems 2 material and methods 2 1 case study the najafabad catchment area 32 18 32 50 n 50 53 51 42 e is one of the main basins of isfahan province located in central iran its area is 1 754 9 km2 of which 679 2 km2 are highlands and 1075 7 km2 are plains the oldest rock formations that occur in the central part of iran include schist gneiss metamorphic andesites and interlayers of metamorphic limestone and dolomite the highest altitude of the region with a height of 2 953 m above sea level is located northwest of the area in contrast the lowest with an elevation of 2 069 m above sea level is located near the zayandehrood river in the region s southeast the najafabad alluvial aquifer has a thickness of 63 5 m and spreads across 941 km2 of land at maximum the contours reach 1 860 m to the northwest and at minimum they reach 1 560 m at the middle of the plain the average level of groundwater in this area is 1 630 m in the najafabad area the contours have a southwest northeast direction analysis of the exploration and pumping wells reaching the bedrock shows that in this region the bedrock mainly consists of shale from the second geological era classified as ductile rocks thus the transfer of water through these plates is at its minimum at the maximum the bedrock contour reaches 1 800 m in the northwestern part of the region while at the minimum it reaches 1 400 m in the central area the mean length of bedrock contour is about 1 600 m the two permanent rivers of the region are zayandehrood and morghab zayandehrood river enters the region from the southern part of this area and leaves from the northern part in contrast the morghab river flows from the northwestern heights and leaves the region after joining the zayandehrood river the geographical location of the area is shown in fig 1 the average annual temperature is 14 6 c the average annual precipitation is 174 3 mm and the average annual evaporation is 2 230 7 mm the nekoabad irrigation network is an important water project in the study area according to the regional groundwater balance currently 883 1 million cubic meters mm3 of groundwater is exploited annually by exploitation wells in the region of which 860 2 mm3 is allocated to the agricultural sector and the rest to the industry and drinking sector the average annual drop in groundwater level in the najafabad aquifer is 1 3 m furthermore according to the groundwater balance the water shortage of the reservoir of the najafabad aquifer is estimated to be 138 mm3 according to the regional groundwater balance sheet and land use map fig 2 the number of exploitation wells in the center of the aquifer for agricultural demands is more than other parts therefore the water table decline can create more dilemmas for agricultural activities mainly dependent on groundwater resources groundwater budget report groundwater resources qualitative and quantitative gavkhuni basin ministry of energy 2016 2 2 methodology this study included three main steps fig 3 described as follows in the first step after collecting the data supplementary information d required to implement the dpsir gof combined frameworks the conceptualization process was conducted to find key variables affecting groundwater resources from a large amount of data then the conceptual model s structure was extracted by analyzing the cause and effect relationships between the framework s parameters finally they were diagnosed and examined after the quantification process of the study factors in the second step after implementing the two frameworks of dpsir and gof weaknesses and strengths opportunities limitations and challenges involving the najafabad aquifer system were extracted and defined at this stage several management approaches and responses were determined in the form of scenarios according to the dpsir gof comprehensive conceptualization process in the last step each of the proposed scenarios was evaluated and prioritized using a set of technical and economic indicators to determine the effectiveness of each scenario to improve the problem of groundwater resources in najafabad also in this stage for evaluating the productivity cba drought and sustainability indicators a set of variables such as groundwater level aquifer volume and storage coefficient changes were required which were obtained using the results of modflow numerical simulation in different time steps 2 3 dpsir framework the dpsir framework oecd 1993 is an analytical method based on cause and effect relationships highlighting the interactions between human activities and the environment in this model the driving forces cause pressure followed by changes in the system s state changes in the state cause impacts and as a result an appropriate response to the system conditions is requested to solve the existing problems responses to the dpsir factors can correct or replace drivers eliminate or reduce pressure intrusion to the system s state and reduce or change impacts after identifying the system this study was conducted to manage and maintain groundwater resources and aquifer balance in the najafabad aquifer system the drivers of pressure include agricultural sector development lack of awareness of farmers and changes in the policy of managers and consumption patterns in this region water exploitation in the three sectors of agriculture drinking and industry increasing the number of exploitation wells and climate change are pressure factors a groundwater resource system is affected by the driving forces pressures that cause different states and quantitative and qualitative changes in water resources the current state in the najafabad aquifer system is groundwater level changes according to the state of the system groundwater level changes the impacts considered are water salinity migration unemployment and poverty a review of technical reports in this area showed that most dwellers in the najafabad area are working in agricultural activities also most of the household demands are met from extracting groundwater resources therefore the decrease in water level in the najafabad aquifer put the farmers job opportunities in jeopardy and forced the residents to emigrate reducing water in the region has also caused the loss of job opportunities for people working in the agricultural sector leading to poverty and creating financial problems finally the responses are the measures and approaches proposed to make changes in the driving forces reduce the pressures on the system and return the system to its original state supplementary information e 2 4 gof the gof van ittersum et al 2008 was used in this study in a combined fashion with the dpsir framework since gof is only a future time based framework its utilization and the dpsir a past time based framework can cover all the periods and integrate the system over time the gof also properly considers all the three dimensions of sustainable development economic social and environmental this framework analyzes the indicators in the three dimensions of sustainable development that have interactions with each other in other words the primary purpose of this framework was to create harmonious relationships among environmental economic and social dimensions and the interactions among these indicators are depicted within the three dimensions of sustainable development alkan olsson et al 2007 alkan olsson et al 2009 geniaux et al 2005 this framework includes scales domains dimensions of sustainable development generic theme themes and sub themes supplementary information a since the gofs have been defined for evaluating the effects of policies at different scales of sustainable development it is necessary to select proper indicators at the evaluation scale ewert et al 2011 the first step is to define the spatial scale or boundaries such as area range and region moreover such frameworks aim to assess the effects of new policies on the agricultural sector and other sectors of society achievement tools are also required to reach the final goals of the project therefore each dimension is divided into three contexts of final goals achievement process and tools this division can make it easier to compare the effects of each dimension and increase their relevance thus helping to define policies in general alkan olsson et al 2007 alkan olsson et al 2009 geniaux et al 2005 marzieh samareh hashemi et al 2019 in the najafabad study area after setting goals in each dimension of sustainable development and determining the criteria contexts and process of achieving these goals indicators of each dimension were determined then after quantifying the processes and identifying opportunities limitations and challenges of the najafabad aquifer system and the results of the dpsir gof framework studies an integrated conceptual model of the aquifer system was created finally approaches to achieve the system s goal of maintaining and balancing the aquifer were introduced 2 5 evaluating and prioritizing dpsir gof model responses using literature various indicators and criteria have been used to evaluate decisions and interventions in complex water resource systems and aquifers shamsabadi et al 2016 javadi et al 2011 bayat and babazade 2013 zeng et al 2013 neshat and pradhan 2017 wassmann and pathak 2007 since the dpsir gof model does not provide specific prioritization and evaluation for scenarios and approaches a set of technical and economic indicators has been used in this study for prioritization the technical indicators included the aquifer sustainability index and drought index while the economic indicators included cba and productivity sustainability index si aquifer sustainability index si eq 1 is the ratio of the amount of water available minus the amount of water consumed or overexploited water to the available amount of water a negative value for si indicates a very high consumption of natural groundwater resources while its high value indicates the existence of excess water for various uses sheikhipour et al 2018 martin carrasco et al 2012 1 i u y i 1 i n s i y 1 s y where iu is the si y is the static volume of the aquifer and s is the changes in the aquifer storage or the amount of overexploitation from the aquifer over time for calculating this index the values of static volume and changes in aquifer storage were obtained using the modflow model also to better compare the effect of each approach on the sustainability of the najafabad aquifer the number of years that the aquifer will be in a sustainable state was calculated using eq 2 2 n 1 i u where n is the number of years that the aquifer will be sustainable drought index di after extracting the groundwater level information in 30 years of implementing the modflow model and determining the amount of water level drop in different parts of the aquifer drought maps that indicate the saturated aquifer thickness were drawn using gis software during the preparation of maps the categories were in the form of completely dry or non exploitable areas red areas with a drop above 60 m semi arid areas or regions on the verge of drought yellow areas with a decline of 20 to 60 m and accessible areas in terms of exploitation green areas with a drop of less than 20 m finally the effects of scenarios were compared according to their affected areas on the aquifer cost benefit analysis cba cba can ensure that total net benefit b is higher than total net costs c in the community b c ratio is a relatively simple and common technique for deciding on an action and making a change molinos senante et al 2010 chen and wang 2009 to determine the amount of b and calculate the b c ratio it was necessary to calculate planting maintenance and harvesting costs agricultural costs as well as drilling costs supplementary information b energy consumption costs for pumping and income from selling the agricultural products benefit this information was collected from existing reports at each stage eq 3 was used to calculate energy consumption costs chueco fernández 2010 3 c t a ρ g h δ h q η b η e where c is cost t is annual operating hours a is the tariff of 1 kwh of electricity ρ is the specific gravity of water g is local gravitational acceleration h is pumping height obtained from the output of modflow model δh is hydraulic losses q is flow rate ηb is the pump efficiency and ηe is the electric motor efficiency finally after determining the net benefit and total costs cba was calculated from the b c ratio nickel et al 2009 productivity index pi water productivity involves the role of each water unit in the agricultural gross domestic product gdp in this study the two indicators of crop per drop cpd and benefit per drop bpd were used to compare water use efficiency in different scenarios water physical productivity index or cdp was calculated using eq 4 4 cpd tp t w c where tp is the amount of product or yield kg ha and twc is the volume of water consumed m3 ha the higher the ratio the better the water consumption but not necessarily the higher the economic benefits mullen et al 1998 bpd is related to the economic and monetary aspects of productivity it is the ratio of gross benefit income per hectare per unit volume of water m3 ha eq 5 5 bpd tr t w c where tr is the value of the total product sold per hectare irr and twc is the volume of water consumed m3 ha a higher value of this index indicates better economic productivity mullen et al 1998 2 6 modflow since the groundwater level and the amount of drop in the intervals were required to calculate technical and economic indicators the numerical simulation of the najafabad aquifer was conducted by the modflow model in the study area there are a total of 17 inlets of groundwater flow to the aquifer of which 49 4 mm3 of groundwater enters the aquifer annually the inlets of the najafabad aquifer were identified based on surface currents flood channels rivers and streams upstream heights and the penetration of currents and snowfall the characteristics and positions of these inlets are stated in the regional groundwater report groundwater budget report meteorological and climatological reports gavkhuni basin ministry of energy 2016 there is no underground outflow in the najafabad aquifer due to high water exploitation from the aquifer center the rate of direct infiltration of rainfall on the plain surface is 29 4 mm which is equivalent to 26 million cubic meters of infiltration into the aquifer the groundwater level is also estimated using data from 40 observation wells fig 1 analyzing the water level statistics of the observation wells network along the path of zayanderud and murghab rivers and comparing it with the water level of the rivers showed that the rivers recharge the aquifer water is pumped from 9 700 exploitation wells throughout the region most of which occupied the central parts of the aquifer the dispersion of the pumping rate in the selected wells is shown in fig 4 further the water table was estimated based on the data collected from 40 observation wells and calibrated for steady state and transient conditions in the simulated model considering the 941 km2 area of the alluvial aquifer the size of cells was considered to be 500 500 m the data of september 2015 were used to run the model in the steady state while the data from september 2015 to august 2018 were used for the transient state finally data from september 2018 to august 2019 were used to validate the model 3 results 3 1 dpsir gof framework results the implementation of the dpsir framework is done in four steps fig 2 first the state of the najafabad aquifer system is the groundwater level quantified by examining the aquifer s water table groundwater budget report meteorological and climatological reports gavkhuni basin ministry of energy 2016 groundwater level variations over the 2000 2015 period demonstrate a significant decline as the water table consistently declined due to the aquifer pressures for example a 1 29 fall in the water table took place over this period with an average of 1 3 m annually which amounts to 20 5 m over the entire period table 1 withdrawal is the most indispensable pressure that persuades water table variations and can be quantified based on agricultural industrial and residential usage over the 2005 2015 period agricultural water withdrawal rose by 53 47 industrial by 58 73 and residential by over 100 which illustrates extreme pressure is exerted on the aquifer promoting groundwater state transitions groundwater budget report najafabad study balance report isfahan regional water company 2016 additionally the further pressure in the najafabad aquifer system is climate change and drought which altered the system s state this pressure was considered using rainfall temperature and evaporation as indicators as a result rainfall decreased by 39 temperature and evaporation increased by 5 6 and 1 3 respectively over the 2005 2015 period the spi moreover reveals a considerable decline and a shift toward drought groundwater budget report najafabad study balance report isfahan regional water company 2016 table 1 the first driver in the region is withdrawal from supply wells which was investigated by the number of exploitation wells over ten years this parameter is increased by 41 in the ten years 2005 2015 table 1 the next studied driver was agricultural development and policy shifts in this sector which resulted in far more withdrawal this driver was considered based on both the total cultivated area and agricultural output which increased by 9 4 and 14 10 respectively during the study period agriculture page 2016 groundwater budget report najafabad study balance report isfahan regional water company 2016 furthermore the agricultural yield was organized per hectare of cultivated land for orchard and farm produce based on the data collected a 10 and a 10 75 drop was found in the yield per hectare for farm crops and orchards respectively the population growth table 1 is another remarkable driver leading to more withdrawal and pressure on the groundwater system affecting groundwater levels this indicates a 14 5 increase in the population from 570 641 in 2005 to 654 108 in 2015 presently najafabad is home to a population of 654 108 master water report 2016 according to experts and technical reports the effects of water resources reduction in the najafabad aquifer system are reflected by a 78 increase in salinity approximately 39 9 unemployment and consequently migration from villages to cities drying wells and subsidence in addition the study of immigration rates showed that migration from rural to urban areas increased by 14 5 between 2005 and 2011 table 1 unlike the dpsir framework gof considers the environmental economic and social aspects of sustainable development in separate dimensions to provide a balanced set of indicators in sustainable development for gof indicators several indicators were selected from the seamless system for environmental and agricultural modelling linking european science and society integrated framework project indicators alkan olsson et al 2009 dpsir indicators technical data and reports experts opinions and information from the regional statistics center the list of gof indicators divided into three dimensions of environment economy and society is brought in table 2 since the quantification of some of the indicators was not easily possible experts opinions have been used to study the framework in addition to find some specialized information in the study area interviews with experts in the field of water resources management executives of water companies stakeholders and researchers in this area have been conducted to find invaluable information about some parameters including subsidence which could not be quantified in the study the environmental dimension s goal is to maintain the health and well being of humans living in the environment management of groundwater inflow and outflow aquifer water consumption and identifying the source of salinity is required to achieve this goal the decrease in the volume of inflow to the aquifer is due to reducing natural and climatic recharge which is examined by temperature evaporation and precipitation the only alternative to solve the shortage of inflow is groundwater outflow management examined by the index of exploitations in different sectors per capita consumption the area under cultivation and cultivation patterns furthermore controlling the infiltration of saline water surface water drainage and agricultural activities may be a solution in terms of reducing salinity as environmental parts of gof and the dpsir frameworks are similar their description is omitted in this section environmental dimension indicators goals processes and tools for achieving these goals are presented in table 2 in the economic dimension indicators show the impact of management decisions and policies on the economy table 2 the ultimate goal in this dimension is the continuity of life the most important economic indicator is the number of bank facilities in the agricultural sector which shows a significant upward trend with a 44 change in the research period also added value in the farm sector has increased by 51 these two indicators show that the economic facilities granted have been useful to increase added value in this sector with an annual cultivation area of more than 3500 ha najafabad is iran s most important agricultural area the conditions for exporting the agricultural products in this region are well provided so that the ratio of exports to imports shows an increase of 97 the last indicator studied in this section is the changes in the profitability of the banking system the profitability of the banking system increased by 53 in 10 years of 2005 2015 finally the goal in the social dimension is the quality of life the impact of new policies is evaluated on the social dimension of the system collecting and quantifying social dimension factors is difficult due to the large size of this sector the gini coefficient was used to examine the differences in economic classes as an important indicator of the equitable distribution of income in the region the average value of the gini coefficient in rural areas and urban areas was 0 33 and 0 34 respectively the jobseekers statistics in recent years show that the number of job seekers has increased which indicates the need for households to earn more income comparing literacy levels in the two years of 2005 and 2015 shows an increasing trend over time the study of employment rates in the last decade in the study area also shows an increase in demand for employment in various industries the analysis of the dpsir framework showed that the agricultural sector puts the most pressure on the system due to uncontrolled groundwater exploitation on the other hand although the groundwater level is directly affected by water exploitation other factors such as climate change also have significant impacts on the condition of an aquifer system therefore responses to the dpsir framework can target any part of this framework to eliminate imbalances and reduce aquifer pressure thus the proposed solutions for the study area are modifying water exploitation volume for different uses and promoting new irrigation patterns modifying cultivation patterns to increase production efficiency due to a significant reduction in production per unit area under cultivation in the research period reducing the area under cultivation of crops and changing the cultivation pattern to prevent the effects of pressure from increasing the agricultural production on the aquifer increasing the efficiencies and reducing water consumption changing the employment pattern from the agricultural sector to industry and services according to the potential of the region based on experts opinions maintaining the population balance in the region especially the educated population and preventing their migration increasing the level of education and raising public knowledge by improving the management structure one of the proposed solutions mentioned in the dpsir framework is to change the employment pattern from the agricultural sector to other sectors due to the high volume of groundwater exploitation for the farm sector and the severe reduction of groundwater on the other hand since the gof framework considers the social and economic dimension of sustainable development together with the environmental dimension changing the employment infrastructure according to the groundwater level index according to the gof results is not logical because although the employment program has favorable effects on groundwater levels it may increase rural urban migration and consequently to social and environmental problems caused by population density another suggested solution is to change the cultivation pattern to consume less water however the change in this policy should also be evaluated according to other indicators such as agricultural income although some crops consume less water their added value is small compared to products that consume more water for example rice can be replaced with other available crops but the agricultural income from cultivating rice is higher than other crops using the findings of the dpsir gof model the scenarios are defined according to the potential of all system dimensions in the najafabad aquifer system two management approaches i e modifying water exploitation and reducing cultivation target agriculture as the largest consumer of water more clearly analyzing the regional reports and reviewing the policy outcomes indicated najafabad as a major consumer of agricultural groundwater the farm sector exerts the highest pressure on local groundwater resources by over drafting several questions arise according to these approaches first how to determine the volume of reduction in the exploitation that does not harm the region s economy besides compensating for the drop in groundwater level does not harm the region s economy second how much should be the reduction of the area under cultivation that in addition to helping solve the aquifer problem does not have economic and social consequences the role of gof in this study was simultaneously considering the social economic and environmental effects of the approaches on the studied system which has reduced the responses of the dpsir framework to the following four scenarios reducing the total groundwater exploitation for the agricultural sector by at least 5 r1 the amount of reduction in the above scenario is 10 r2 reducing the area under cultivation by 10 to compensate for the shortage of groundwater resources c1 the amount of reduction in the above scenario is 20 c2 therefore the scenarios of the dpsir gof model were finalized for evaluation the purpose of defining these scenarios was to find the most practical policy to compensate for the decrease in groundwater level and create economic social and environmental security 3 2 modflow results technical and economic indicators were calculated using the modflow model groundwater simulation was performed using data from 40 observation wells in both steady and transient states at first the mean value of specific yield was determined by 10 for this aquifer according to the hydrodynamic coefficients of wells and the pumping test results it decreased to 5 in the northwest region reaching as high as 15 in the vicinity of the zayanderud river subsequently the mean initial specific yield was considered 10 according to the water balance report the mean hydraulic conductivity is 15 m d zayanderud river moving from southeast of the plain toward the north affects hydrological conditions and hydraulic conductivity may reach 27 m d in this part of the aquifer groundwater budget report najafabad study balance report isfahan regional water company 2016 consequently the initial hydraulic conductivity was assumed 15 m d hydraulic conductivity and aquifer specific yield were calibrated at the steady state september 2015 and the transient state september 2015 to august 2018 periods after calibration hydraulic conductivity was estimated between 1 5 m d to 38 m d the specific yield also was calibrated under transient conditions varying between 2 and 20 in different parts of the najafabad aquifer fig 5 finally the data for a year after the transient simulation period september 2018 to august 2019 was entered into the model for verification the errors of the model are brought in table 3 to evaluate the performance of the model the table shows that the model is capable of predicting groundwater levels fig 6 shows the stream lines in the najafabad aquifer fig 6 a the bedrock elevation fig 6 b and modflow conceptual model fig 6 c in the najafabad aquifer the water table measurements at observation wells were also plotted with fig 7 containing two examples 3 3 technical indicators after defining and analyzing the frameworks changes in the driving forces of the crop under cultivation and water exploitation to prevent aquifer level drop and increase the system s social and economic security were proposed in the form of scenarios after calibration and verification of the mathematical model scenarios r1 r2 c1 and c2 were examined to predict groundwater resources future then the maps of level drop and drought of these scenarios after 30 years were drawn using the gms model output fig 8 also si was calculated using the results of the modflow model and eqs 1 and 2 the results are shown in table 4 for the scenarios and in a situation where no scenario governs the system conditions the optimal values of si are values close to 1 according to the table scenario r2 resulted in a more improvement of si than other scenarios followed by scenarios r1 c2 and c1 respectively 3 4 economic indicators cpd and bpd indicators in the najafabad area are presented in table 4 according to the table cpd was highly affected by scenarios c2 and c1 respectively and the lowest cpd value was observed for scenario r2 on the other hand bpd is the highest in scenario r2 and decreases in c1 and c2 its lowest value was observed in the situation where no scenario was implemented in the region therefore based on pi the influential factors in improving cpd and bpd were reducing cultivation area and reducing exploitation respectively the second economic indicator investigated in this study was cba the results of cba were obtained with drought and aquifer level drop in the next 30 years which are shown in the form of drought maps in fig 8 during the analysis the red areas were not included in the calculations due to their complete dryness and unprofitability accordingly the total costs of green and yellow areas including drilling costs agricultural costs including planting maintenance and harvesting and energy consumption costs eq 3 as well as the total benefit of selling agricultural products were calculated for each scenario table 4 again a fixed cost was considered for drilling during the study period as the amount of water available to farmers decreased due to increasing annual drop and reducing their annual benefits and increasing costs over the period the b c ratio showed a decreasing trend in all scenarios due to the higher drop this ratio had a lower value in the yellow areas than the green areas this means that as the drop increased energy consumption costs for pumping water in exploitation wells increased consequently as the water level decreased the amount of water available to farmers to produce agricultural products decreased table 4 shows that scenario r2 resulted in the highest performance and profitability 4 discussion recently several comprehensive assessments based on conceptual models including groundwater and welfare framework katuva et al 2020 a framework for ecological responses to groundwater regime alteration kath et al 2018 have been presented for aquifers rushton 2004 although in recent years several studies have been conducted based on management frameworks such as dpsir and gof the comprehensive framework of dpsir and gof is a new issue that was defined in 2019 for the first time marzieh samareh hashemi et al 2019 since these frameworks cannot prioritize proposed scenarios it has been suggested to couple these frameworks with other methods to resolve this problem kelble et al 2013 elliott et al 2017 chandrakumar and mclaren 2018 the state of the najafabad aquifer system in the dpsir framework according to fig 9 is the groundwater level the aquifer is directly affected by the exploitation for various sectors but also other mechanisms such as climate change have significant impacts on the water level motamedi et al 2021 groundwater budget report najafabad study balance report isfahan regional water company 2016 by examining the evaporation temperature and precipitation of the aquifer in the study period it was found that all three had their roles in reducing the inflow to the aquifer as a pressure that has changed the system s state exploitation is also affected by the three sectors of agriculture drinking and industry in the agricultural sector alone groundwater exploitation has grown by 53 47 in the last decade the increase in consumption in the farm sector is influenced by the area s drivers under cultivation and the cultivation pattern the driver of the area under cultivation increased by 9 40 from 2005 to 2015 in dividing the cultivation pattern into two categories horticulture and agronomy it was found that each of them decreased by 10 75 and 10 respectively there has been an increase in harvest in the agricultural sector but production per unit area has reduced the excess water that is consumed over the years has been used for the additional area under cultivation while the efficiencies have not only not been in the direction of improvement but have also been decreasing the downward trend of production per unit area is quite significant on the other hand according to the gof analysis policies such as increasing bank facilities to the agricultural sector are not effective and it seems necessary to change the mechanisms in other words production efficiency has decreased due to the increase in water consumption fig 9 this means that increasing the area under cultivation to increase crop production has been practically ineffective as a result reducing the quantity and quality of agricultural products can endanger the region s economic security in the industrial sector the growth of industrial units has increased by 58 8 on the other hand the two factors of population and per capita consumption indicates the exploitation amount in the drinking sector which has increased by more than 100 with a 14 5 increase in population in recent years the effects of groundwater shortage are land subsidence migration and poverty in the region studies have shown a severe need to create job opportunities due to rural urban migration in recent years and the population growth of 14 5 therefore one of the proposed solutions to improve the conditions is changing the employment patterns however based on gof it is not logical to consider the migration index to urban areas due to changes in employment infrastructure and the groundwater level index although changing the employment patterns has sound effects on the groundwater level it might lead to an additional burden of rural urban migration and social and environmental problems due to population growth another suggestion is to change the cultivation pattern by studying the crops wheat and paddy were introduced as the region s two dominant and water consuming crops therefore eliminating cultivations with high water consumption and low economic efficiency can reduce consumption and water exploitation on the other hand although some crops consume less water their added value is minimal compared to products that consume more water therefore considering the two factors of groundwater level and agricultural income at the same time is of particular importance the investigation of drought maps and si in the study area showed that scenario r2 could remarkably prevent the destruction of the aquifer and help its recovery during the simulation period however the impact of other scenarios was much less therefore based on this indicator reducing water exploitation from groundwater resources by one half of the reservoir deficit in the long term runs can be suggested to policymakers and farmers to maintain the aquifer s balance moreover the results of the scenarios based on cba and pi indicators also confirmed the effects of scenario r2 i e a 10 reduction in the amount of exploitation more than those of other scenarios in contrast the study of cpd showed that the scenarios of the reduced area under cultivation had the highest performance compared to the scenarios involving the reduced water exploitation volume which is an important finding according to the literature the response of groundwater systems similar to the present study is in the form of policy making and management of groundwater exploitation tariff reform indirect pricing of groundwater resources raising awareness of farmers and adopting special measures to restrict agricultural activities to illustrate given that employment in the farming sector in this region is by far more than other parts creating job opportunities in the industrial and service sectors and encouraging the labor force to work in these sectors instead of agricultural activities can be indispensable policy in this region furthermore rational determination of agricultural water resources for management and control of groundwater exploitation by farmers increasing the level of education and raising public knowledge of different people in the community about the importance of groundwater resources and clarifying the dependence of regional life on groundwater resources can also be effective management approaches are usually general and conceptual frameworks do not provide guidelines for quantifying responses and prioritizing them therefore in some studies recommendations have been made for using frameworks combined with other models in this study the system s responses were in the form of reducing the aquifer exploitation and the area under cultivation in the region and their prioritization with the help of economic and technical indicators to obtain sustainable groundwater resources systems and maintain economic and social security 5 conclusion the dpsir framework and gof have been developed in this study dpsir is a framework involving the past and present information of the groundwater system while gof can assess the future status of it in other words the dpsir framework alone is associated with significant disadvantages including the lack of considering all dimensions of time economic and social dimensions therefore using the gof framework in this research can achieve a complete and integrated point of view of the system by considering all aspects of sustainable development however since using the dpsir framework alone cannot ensure the economic and social security of stakeholders and the system conceptualization is highly unlikely to be integrated with the help of this framework the mathematical model development through simulation and analysis of scenarios with the help of economic and technical indicators and the dpsir gof framework also helped to compare the scenarios quantitatively according to the results the effects of the two groups of basic policies of reducing the aquifer exploitation and the area under cultivation on solving the problems of the najafabad aquifer system have determined the direction of future policies it was found that the applicable scenario was a 10 reduction in groundwater exploitation which in most cases had the best effects on the najafabad aquifer system this scenario can prevent the critical situation of water shortage significantly in the future it also guarantees the health and well being of humans and the environment by compensating for groundwater loss resulting in economic and social health and security it is worth mentioning that there are some other scenarios on the side of providing alternative sources to irrigation namely artificial recharge and rainwater harvesting that can be considered in the scenario definition process the study of the effect of the proposed approaches in the future can be performed with social indicators technical and economic indicators in addition mcdm and ahp can also be used to understand better the effect of scenarios in each dimension of sustainable development funding this research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public commercial or not for profit sectors

3759,with increasing exploitation of groundwater resources integrated assessment of aquifers is an essential step to maintain aquifers sustainability the dpsir gof drivers pressures states impacts responses goal oriented framework combined approach is used in this study to conceptualize and identify various factors affecting the najafabad aquifer system in iran neither dpsir nor gof frameworks when used separately can consider a specific prioritization for the solutions and the proposed scenarios nor can provide a comprehensive view of the system from the past to the future therefore the unique combination of the dpsir and gof frameworks in this study is used to conceptualize and evaluate the aquifer system from the past to the future considering the environmental economic and social dimensions of sustainable development to implement this combined approach hydrological data groundwater level evaporation rate precipitation rate temperature rate etc and economic and social data population rate employment status income level literacy level etc were used after identifying the links and dimensions of the dpsir gof framework some scenarios are proposed to improve the aquifer s state furthermore evaluation indicators including technical indicators aquifer sustainability and dryness and economic indicators productivity and cost benefit analysis are used to determine the performance of management scenarios and prioritize their effectiveness in restoring and sustaining the aquifer finally the scenarios of 5 r1 and 10 r2 reduction in groundwater exploitation as well as 10 c1 and 20 c2 reduction of cultivated area were introduced results show that a decrease in exploitations over 30 years effectively maintained the aquifer balance in all four scenarios scenario r2 with crop per drop benefit per drop and cba of 1 62 9 3 and 0 39 respectively was preferred to other scenarios during the 30 years of the simulation period based on a 41 year sustainability index scenario r2 performed better in reducing the impact of drought than other scenarios sources of uncertainties involved in this study were hydrological data including aquifer inputs and outputs agricultural costs and crop production based on region s inflation rate the findings can help decision makers and managers choose the most appropriate approach and policy to obtain sustainable groundwater resource systems and maintain economic and social security keywords dpsir gof framework groundwater system security economic indicators technical indicators najafabad aquifer aquifer recovery 1 introduction in some arid and semi arid regions groundwater is the primary water source to meet various needs of communities for drinking and agriculture moreover groundwater is essential and preferable due to its relatively good quality howard 2015 mwi gtz 2004 neshat et al 2014 on the one hand arid and semi arid areas are affected by various factors such as climate change and reduced precipitation increasing population technological advances and agricultural development have led to excessive exploitation of groundwater resources which will reduce access to groundwater in the not so distant future wreikat and kharabsheh 2020 qu et al 2013 furthermore decreasing groundwater levels can have devastating effects on natural streamflows and related ecosystems land subsidence and saltwater intrusion wada et al 2010 therefore the long term conservation to these valuable water resources depends on their proper utilization of different levels of groundwater management ranging from implementation of artificial recharge or conjunctive use with other water sources cuadrado quesada and rayfuse 2019 mohan and kuipally 2021 sekar and randhir 2007 consequently sustainable management of groundwater resources using integrated comprehensive accurate and effective methods is necessary marzieh samareh hashemi et al 2019 simonovic and rajasekaram 2004 sun et al 2016 kinzelbach et al 2004 to achieve a comprehensive and integrated groundwater resources management conceptual models which are developed widely in the world can be used rushton 2004 bagheri et al 2010 cuilin 2011 madani and mariño 2009 prodanovic and simonovic 2010 safavi et al 2015 white et al 2013 kaur et al 2020 khan and al ghouti 2021 one of the essential pillars in constructing conceptual models is frameworks that express the cause and effect structure of the systems therefore when dealing with complicated natural systems such as aquifers it is necessary to use causal frameworks skoulikidis 2009 although there are various frameworks for understanding the interaction of cause and effect relationships and for the integrated evaluation of systems geniaux et al 2005 the driver pressure state impact response dpsir framework has been used more than others potschin 2009 the dpsir framework can organize various information to manage a system and clearly show the cause and effect relationships of the system to stakeholders maxim et al 2009 bidone et al 2003 it can also identify problems to facilitate recognizing and studying system relationships analysis and possible answers to existing problems walmsley and consultants 2002 the dpsir framework has been widely used to assess coastal environmental changes marine ecosystems as well as anticipate future challenges and improve the implementation of management activities karageorgis et al 2006 lin et al 2007 goble et al 2017 newton and weichselgartner 2014 kagalou et al 2012 malmir et al 2021 gari et al 2018 terêncio et al 2017 terêncio et al 2018 despite the widespread and useful applications of the dpsir framework it is also associated with fundamental limitations firstly the dpsir framework is more appropriate for ex post assessments and in fact does not consider the effects of future scenarios and policies in other words to evaluate complex systems it is better to select effective indicators and criteria based on measured data that involve the past present and future status of the system alkan olsson et al 2009 secondly in integrated assessments it is necessary to balance among different dimensions of sustainable development environmental economic and social united nations 2015 roberts and colwell 2001 burchell and lightfoot 2004 which the dpsir framework cannot be used in this process hermanowicz 2008 alkan olsson et al 2009 alkan olsson et al 2007 marzieh samareh hashemi et al 2019 there is a critical need to use other tools with this framework to achieve an integrated and comprehensive period past present and future of the aquifer system an assessment need to identify the effects of future decisions and policies on the current and future state of water resources systems a goal oriented framework gof can complement the assessments alongside the dpsir framework in addition to possible future changes the gof can evaluate the system from three main dimensions of sustainable development economic social and environmental the gof is a tool designed to conduct integrated assessments to determine the impact of new policies and technologies on agricultural systems and the impact of agricultural systems on the rest of the world van ittersum et al 2008 alkan olsson et al 2009 alkan olsson et al 2007 furthermore it has often been used in urban sustainability studies cabot et al 2009 mahaux et al 2011 a study also used gof to develop a strategy to identify the characteristics and value of a river to human life and its relationships with the environment in this study the grounded group decision making ggdm method was used to validate the developed strategies shafaghat et al 2017 for a sustainable and comprehensive evaluation of water resources systems it is necessary to consider the present and future states and the past hermanowicz 2008 the simultaneous use of dpsir and gof frameworks can fill this need by considering all periods in the past present and future to assess the impacts of policies for example in a study on the khorasan region of iran both frameworks were used to identify all the variables affecting the water resources system and conceptualize it entirely with the full coverage of the time dimension this combined framework helps stakeholders easily identify key variables that should be considered for efficient modeling in system analysis marzieh samareh hashemi et al 2019 a literature review shows that both dpsir and gof frameworks used individually do not consider a specific prioritization for the proposed solutions and cannot individually determine the impact of responses on complex systems robele gari et al 2015 rasi nezami et al 2013 more specifically these frameworks do not have the capability of validating scenarios and determining their effects in complex water resource systems including aquifers on the other hand dpsir and gof frameworks have not been used simultaneously to assess the sustainability and management of groundwater resources and aquifers therefore in some studies analytical methods such as multi criteria decision making mcdm malekmohammadi and jahanishakib 2017 analytic hierarchy process ahp liu et al 2018 sun et al 2016 and structural equation models have been used along with either of these frameworks to prioritize the effect of approaches and calculate the weight of indicators sun et al 2018 in the current study a combination of dpsir and gof frameworks has been used to conceptualize and evaluate the aquifer system for the first time in groundwater literature evaluation indicators have also been used to identify the performance of management scenarios and prioritize their effectiveness in maintaining aquifer sustainability to prevent environmental economic and social problems and maintain economic and social security in the future which is another innovation of this study in other words for the first time in this study after the conceptualizing processes using the dpsir gof model economic and technical tools are used to investigate the impact of each management approach on groundwater levels solving the problems of complex systems of water resources including aquifers requires considering the technical and economic effects of the proposed solutions mayer and muñoz hernandez 2009 therefore two essential indicators are used in this study technical indicators included are sustainable development index and aquifer dryness which indicate the aquifer s performance under the influence of over exploitation and the amount of aquifer local dryness due to over exploitation respectively martin carrasco et al 2012 sheikhipour et al 2018 moreover productivity and cost benefit analysis cba are used as two indicators to determine the impacts of approaches on the economic situation and consequently maintain economic and social balance and security these two indicators analyze water use efficiency at different levels of agriculture and compare the ratio of revenue and costs respectively nickel et al 2009 molden 1997 the aquifer s numerical simulation is required to calculate some parameters such as groundwater level aquifer volume and storage coefficient changes thus the najafabad aquifer was simulated using the modflow model harbaugh 2005 by applying the combined model of dpsir gof and analyzing the impact of policies using the indicators the effects of approaches on maintaining the sustainability and balance of groundwater level of the aquifer and advancing the economic and social situation of the region in the agricultural sector were determined to obtain sustainable groundwater system and maintain economic and social security in other words based on the results of combining both frameworks analyzing the effects of scenarios and adopting the selected policy an important step can be taken in enhancing the storage and recovery of complex groundwater systems 2 material and methods 2 1 case study the najafabad catchment area 32 18 32 50 n 50 53 51 42 e is one of the main basins of isfahan province located in central iran its area is 1 754 9 km2 of which 679 2 km2 are highlands and 1075 7 km2 are plains the oldest rock formations that occur in the central part of iran include schist gneiss metamorphic andesites and interlayers of metamorphic limestone and dolomite the highest altitude of the region with a height of 2 953 m above sea level is located northwest of the area in contrast the lowest with an elevation of 2 069 m above sea level is located near the zayandehrood river in the region s southeast the najafabad alluvial aquifer has a thickness of 63 5 m and spreads across 941 km2 of land at maximum the contours reach 1 860 m to the northwest and at minimum they reach 1 560 m at the middle of the plain the average level of groundwater in this area is 1 630 m in the najafabad area the contours have a southwest northeast direction analysis of the exploration and pumping wells reaching the bedrock shows that in this region the bedrock mainly consists of shale from the second geological era classified as ductile rocks thus the transfer of water through these plates is at its minimum at the maximum the bedrock contour reaches 1 800 m in the northwestern part of the region while at the minimum it reaches 1 400 m in the central area the mean length of bedrock contour is about 1 600 m the two permanent rivers of the region are zayandehrood and morghab zayandehrood river enters the region from the southern part of this area and leaves from the northern part in contrast the morghab river flows from the northwestern heights and leaves the region after joining the zayandehrood river the geographical location of the area is shown in fig 1 the average annual temperature is 14 6 c the average annual precipitation is 174 3 mm and the average annual evaporation is 2 230 7 mm the nekoabad irrigation network is an important water project in the study area according to the regional groundwater balance currently 883 1 million cubic meters mm3 of groundwater is exploited annually by exploitation wells in the region of which 860 2 mm3 is allocated to the agricultural sector and the rest to the industry and drinking sector the average annual drop in groundwater level in the najafabad aquifer is 1 3 m furthermore according to the groundwater balance the water shortage of the reservoir of the najafabad aquifer is estimated to be 138 mm3 according to the regional groundwater balance sheet and land use map fig 2 the number of exploitation wells in the center of the aquifer for agricultural demands is more than other parts therefore the water table decline can create more dilemmas for agricultural activities mainly dependent on groundwater resources groundwater budget report groundwater resources qualitative and quantitative gavkhuni basin ministry of energy 2016 2 2 methodology this study included three main steps fig 3 described as follows in the first step after collecting the data supplementary information d required to implement the dpsir gof combined frameworks the conceptualization process was conducted to find key variables affecting groundwater resources from a large amount of data then the conceptual model s structure was extracted by analyzing the cause and effect relationships between the framework s parameters finally they were diagnosed and examined after the quantification process of the study factors in the second step after implementing the two frameworks of dpsir and gof weaknesses and strengths opportunities limitations and challenges involving the najafabad aquifer system were extracted and defined at this stage several management approaches and responses were determined in the form of scenarios according to the dpsir gof comprehensive conceptualization process in the last step each of the proposed scenarios was evaluated and prioritized using a set of technical and economic indicators to determine the effectiveness of each scenario to improve the problem of groundwater resources in najafabad also in this stage for evaluating the productivity cba drought and sustainability indicators a set of variables such as groundwater level aquifer volume and storage coefficient changes were required which were obtained using the results of modflow numerical simulation in different time steps 2 3 dpsir framework the dpsir framework oecd 1993 is an analytical method based on cause and effect relationships highlighting the interactions between human activities and the environment in this model the driving forces cause pressure followed by changes in the system s state changes in the state cause impacts and as a result an appropriate response to the system conditions is requested to solve the existing problems responses to the dpsir factors can correct or replace drivers eliminate or reduce pressure intrusion to the system s state and reduce or change impacts after identifying the system this study was conducted to manage and maintain groundwater resources and aquifer balance in the najafabad aquifer system the drivers of pressure include agricultural sector development lack of awareness of farmers and changes in the policy of managers and consumption patterns in this region water exploitation in the three sectors of agriculture drinking and industry increasing the number of exploitation wells and climate change are pressure factors a groundwater resource system is affected by the driving forces pressures that cause different states and quantitative and qualitative changes in water resources the current state in the najafabad aquifer system is groundwater level changes according to the state of the system groundwater level changes the impacts considered are water salinity migration unemployment and poverty a review of technical reports in this area showed that most dwellers in the najafabad area are working in agricultural activities also most of the household demands are met from extracting groundwater resources therefore the decrease in water level in the najafabad aquifer put the farmers job opportunities in jeopardy and forced the residents to emigrate reducing water in the region has also caused the loss of job opportunities for people working in the agricultural sector leading to poverty and creating financial problems finally the responses are the measures and approaches proposed to make changes in the driving forces reduce the pressures on the system and return the system to its original state supplementary information e 2 4 gof the gof van ittersum et al 2008 was used in this study in a combined fashion with the dpsir framework since gof is only a future time based framework its utilization and the dpsir a past time based framework can cover all the periods and integrate the system over time the gof also properly considers all the three dimensions of sustainable development economic social and environmental this framework analyzes the indicators in the three dimensions of sustainable development that have interactions with each other in other words the primary purpose of this framework was to create harmonious relationships among environmental economic and social dimensions and the interactions among these indicators are depicted within the three dimensions of sustainable development alkan olsson et al 2007 alkan olsson et al 2009 geniaux et al 2005 this framework includes scales domains dimensions of sustainable development generic theme themes and sub themes supplementary information a since the gofs have been defined for evaluating the effects of policies at different scales of sustainable development it is necessary to select proper indicators at the evaluation scale ewert et al 2011 the first step is to define the spatial scale or boundaries such as area range and region moreover such frameworks aim to assess the effects of new policies on the agricultural sector and other sectors of society achievement tools are also required to reach the final goals of the project therefore each dimension is divided into three contexts of final goals achievement process and tools this division can make it easier to compare the effects of each dimension and increase their relevance thus helping to define policies in general alkan olsson et al 2007 alkan olsson et al 2009 geniaux et al 2005 marzieh samareh hashemi et al 2019 in the najafabad study area after setting goals in each dimension of sustainable development and determining the criteria contexts and process of achieving these goals indicators of each dimension were determined then after quantifying the processes and identifying opportunities limitations and challenges of the najafabad aquifer system and the results of the dpsir gof framework studies an integrated conceptual model of the aquifer system was created finally approaches to achieve the system s goal of maintaining and balancing the aquifer were introduced 2 5 evaluating and prioritizing dpsir gof model responses using literature various indicators and criteria have been used to evaluate decisions and interventions in complex water resource systems and aquifers shamsabadi et al 2016 javadi et al 2011 bayat and babazade 2013 zeng et al 2013 neshat and pradhan 2017 wassmann and pathak 2007 since the dpsir gof model does not provide specific prioritization and evaluation for scenarios and approaches a set of technical and economic indicators has been used in this study for prioritization the technical indicators included the aquifer sustainability index and drought index while the economic indicators included cba and productivity sustainability index si aquifer sustainability index si eq 1 is the ratio of the amount of water available minus the amount of water consumed or overexploited water to the available amount of water a negative value for si indicates a very high consumption of natural groundwater resources while its high value indicates the existence of excess water for various uses sheikhipour et al 2018 martin carrasco et al 2012 1 i u y i 1 i n s i y 1 s y where iu is the si y is the static volume of the aquifer and s is the changes in the aquifer storage or the amount of overexploitation from the aquifer over time for calculating this index the values of static volume and changes in aquifer storage were obtained using the modflow model also to better compare the effect of each approach on the sustainability of the najafabad aquifer the number of years that the aquifer will be in a sustainable state was calculated using eq 2 2 n 1 i u where n is the number of years that the aquifer will be sustainable drought index di after extracting the groundwater level information in 30 years of implementing the modflow model and determining the amount of water level drop in different parts of the aquifer drought maps that indicate the saturated aquifer thickness were drawn using gis software during the preparation of maps the categories were in the form of completely dry or non exploitable areas red areas with a drop above 60 m semi arid areas or regions on the verge of drought yellow areas with a decline of 20 to 60 m and accessible areas in terms of exploitation green areas with a drop of less than 20 m finally the effects of scenarios were compared according to their affected areas on the aquifer cost benefit analysis cba cba can ensure that total net benefit b is higher than total net costs c in the community b c ratio is a relatively simple and common technique for deciding on an action and making a change molinos senante et al 2010 chen and wang 2009 to determine the amount of b and calculate the b c ratio it was necessary to calculate planting maintenance and harvesting costs agricultural costs as well as drilling costs supplementary information b energy consumption costs for pumping and income from selling the agricultural products benefit this information was collected from existing reports at each stage eq 3 was used to calculate energy consumption costs chueco fernández 2010 3 c t a ρ g h δ h q η b η e where c is cost t is annual operating hours a is the tariff of 1 kwh of electricity ρ is the specific gravity of water g is local gravitational acceleration h is pumping height obtained from the output of modflow model δh is hydraulic losses q is flow rate ηb is the pump efficiency and ηe is the electric motor efficiency finally after determining the net benefit and total costs cba was calculated from the b c ratio nickel et al 2009 productivity index pi water productivity involves the role of each water unit in the agricultural gross domestic product gdp in this study the two indicators of crop per drop cpd and benefit per drop bpd were used to compare water use efficiency in different scenarios water physical productivity index or cdp was calculated using eq 4 4 cpd tp t w c where tp is the amount of product or yield kg ha and twc is the volume of water consumed m3 ha the higher the ratio the better the water consumption but not necessarily the higher the economic benefits mullen et al 1998 bpd is related to the economic and monetary aspects of productivity it is the ratio of gross benefit income per hectare per unit volume of water m3 ha eq 5 5 bpd tr t w c where tr is the value of the total product sold per hectare irr and twc is the volume of water consumed m3 ha a higher value of this index indicates better economic productivity mullen et al 1998 2 6 modflow since the groundwater level and the amount of drop in the intervals were required to calculate technical and economic indicators the numerical simulation of the najafabad aquifer was conducted by the modflow model in the study area there are a total of 17 inlets of groundwater flow to the aquifer of which 49 4 mm3 of groundwater enters the aquifer annually the inlets of the najafabad aquifer were identified based on surface currents flood channels rivers and streams upstream heights and the penetration of currents and snowfall the characteristics and positions of these inlets are stated in the regional groundwater report groundwater budget report meteorological and climatological reports gavkhuni basin ministry of energy 2016 there is no underground outflow in the najafabad aquifer due to high water exploitation from the aquifer center the rate of direct infiltration of rainfall on the plain surface is 29 4 mm which is equivalent to 26 million cubic meters of infiltration into the aquifer the groundwater level is also estimated using data from 40 observation wells fig 1 analyzing the water level statistics of the observation wells network along the path of zayanderud and murghab rivers and comparing it with the water level of the rivers showed that the rivers recharge the aquifer water is pumped from 9 700 exploitation wells throughout the region most of which occupied the central parts of the aquifer the dispersion of the pumping rate in the selected wells is shown in fig 4 further the water table was estimated based on the data collected from 40 observation wells and calibrated for steady state and transient conditions in the simulated model considering the 941 km2 area of the alluvial aquifer the size of cells was considered to be 500 500 m the data of september 2015 were used to run the model in the steady state while the data from september 2015 to august 2018 were used for the transient state finally data from september 2018 to august 2019 were used to validate the model 3 results 3 1 dpsir gof framework results the implementation of the dpsir framework is done in four steps fig 2 first the state of the najafabad aquifer system is the groundwater level quantified by examining the aquifer s water table groundwater budget report meteorological and climatological reports gavkhuni basin ministry of energy 2016 groundwater level variations over the 2000 2015 period demonstrate a significant decline as the water table consistently declined due to the aquifer pressures for example a 1 29 fall in the water table took place over this period with an average of 1 3 m annually which amounts to 20 5 m over the entire period table 1 withdrawal is the most indispensable pressure that persuades water table variations and can be quantified based on agricultural industrial and residential usage over the 2005 2015 period agricultural water withdrawal rose by 53 47 industrial by 58 73 and residential by over 100 which illustrates extreme pressure is exerted on the aquifer promoting groundwater state transitions groundwater budget report najafabad study balance report isfahan regional water company 2016 additionally the further pressure in the najafabad aquifer system is climate change and drought which altered the system s state this pressure was considered using rainfall temperature and evaporation as indicators as a result rainfall decreased by 39 temperature and evaporation increased by 5 6 and 1 3 respectively over the 2005 2015 period the spi moreover reveals a considerable decline and a shift toward drought groundwater budget report najafabad study balance report isfahan regional water company 2016 table 1 the first driver in the region is withdrawal from supply wells which was investigated by the number of exploitation wells over ten years this parameter is increased by 41 in the ten years 2005 2015 table 1 the next studied driver was agricultural development and policy shifts in this sector which resulted in far more withdrawal this driver was considered based on both the total cultivated area and agricultural output which increased by 9 4 and 14 10 respectively during the study period agriculture page 2016 groundwater budget report najafabad study balance report isfahan regional water company 2016 furthermore the agricultural yield was organized per hectare of cultivated land for orchard and farm produce based on the data collected a 10 and a 10 75 drop was found in the yield per hectare for farm crops and orchards respectively the population growth table 1 is another remarkable driver leading to more withdrawal and pressure on the groundwater system affecting groundwater levels this indicates a 14 5 increase in the population from 570 641 in 2005 to 654 108 in 2015 presently najafabad is home to a population of 654 108 master water report 2016 according to experts and technical reports the effects of water resources reduction in the najafabad aquifer system are reflected by a 78 increase in salinity approximately 39 9 unemployment and consequently migration from villages to cities drying wells and subsidence in addition the study of immigration rates showed that migration from rural to urban areas increased by 14 5 between 2005 and 2011 table 1 unlike the dpsir framework gof considers the environmental economic and social aspects of sustainable development in separate dimensions to provide a balanced set of indicators in sustainable development for gof indicators several indicators were selected from the seamless system for environmental and agricultural modelling linking european science and society integrated framework project indicators alkan olsson et al 2009 dpsir indicators technical data and reports experts opinions and information from the regional statistics center the list of gof indicators divided into three dimensions of environment economy and society is brought in table 2 since the quantification of some of the indicators was not easily possible experts opinions have been used to study the framework in addition to find some specialized information in the study area interviews with experts in the field of water resources management executives of water companies stakeholders and researchers in this area have been conducted to find invaluable information about some parameters including subsidence which could not be quantified in the study the environmental dimension s goal is to maintain the health and well being of humans living in the environment management of groundwater inflow and outflow aquifer water consumption and identifying the source of salinity is required to achieve this goal the decrease in the volume of inflow to the aquifer is due to reducing natural and climatic recharge which is examined by temperature evaporation and precipitation the only alternative to solve the shortage of inflow is groundwater outflow management examined by the index of exploitations in different sectors per capita consumption the area under cultivation and cultivation patterns furthermore controlling the infiltration of saline water surface water drainage and agricultural activities may be a solution in terms of reducing salinity as environmental parts of gof and the dpsir frameworks are similar their description is omitted in this section environmental dimension indicators goals processes and tools for achieving these goals are presented in table 2 in the economic dimension indicators show the impact of management decisions and policies on the economy table 2 the ultimate goal in this dimension is the continuity of life the most important economic indicator is the number of bank facilities in the agricultural sector which shows a significant upward trend with a 44 change in the research period also added value in the farm sector has increased by 51 these two indicators show that the economic facilities granted have been useful to increase added value in this sector with an annual cultivation area of more than 3500 ha najafabad is iran s most important agricultural area the conditions for exporting the agricultural products in this region are well provided so that the ratio of exports to imports shows an increase of 97 the last indicator studied in this section is the changes in the profitability of the banking system the profitability of the banking system increased by 53 in 10 years of 2005 2015 finally the goal in the social dimension is the quality of life the impact of new policies is evaluated on the social dimension of the system collecting and quantifying social dimension factors is difficult due to the large size of this sector the gini coefficient was used to examine the differences in economic classes as an important indicator of the equitable distribution of income in the region the average value of the gini coefficient in rural areas and urban areas was 0 33 and 0 34 respectively the jobseekers statistics in recent years show that the number of job seekers has increased which indicates the need for households to earn more income comparing literacy levels in the two years of 2005 and 2015 shows an increasing trend over time the study of employment rates in the last decade in the study area also shows an increase in demand for employment in various industries the analysis of the dpsir framework showed that the agricultural sector puts the most pressure on the system due to uncontrolled groundwater exploitation on the other hand although the groundwater level is directly affected by water exploitation other factors such as climate change also have significant impacts on the condition of an aquifer system therefore responses to the dpsir framework can target any part of this framework to eliminate imbalances and reduce aquifer pressure thus the proposed solutions for the study area are modifying water exploitation volume for different uses and promoting new irrigation patterns modifying cultivation patterns to increase production efficiency due to a significant reduction in production per unit area under cultivation in the research period reducing the area under cultivation of crops and changing the cultivation pattern to prevent the effects of pressure from increasing the agricultural production on the aquifer increasing the efficiencies and reducing water consumption changing the employment pattern from the agricultural sector to industry and services according to the potential of the region based on experts opinions maintaining the population balance in the region especially the educated population and preventing their migration increasing the level of education and raising public knowledge by improving the management structure one of the proposed solutions mentioned in the dpsir framework is to change the employment pattern from the agricultural sector to other sectors due to the high volume of groundwater exploitation for the farm sector and the severe reduction of groundwater on the other hand since the gof framework considers the social and economic dimension of sustainable development together with the environmental dimension changing the employment infrastructure according to the groundwater level index according to the gof results is not logical because although the employment program has favorable effects on groundwater levels it may increase rural urban migration and consequently to social and environmental problems caused by population density another suggested solution is to change the cultivation pattern to consume less water however the change in this policy should also be evaluated according to other indicators such as agricultural income although some crops consume less water their added value is small compared to products that consume more water for example rice can be replaced with other available crops but the agricultural income from cultivating rice is higher than other crops using the findings of the dpsir gof model the scenarios are defined according to the potential of all system dimensions in the najafabad aquifer system two management approaches i e modifying water exploitation and reducing cultivation target agriculture as the largest consumer of water more clearly analyzing the regional reports and reviewing the policy outcomes indicated najafabad as a major consumer of agricultural groundwater the farm sector exerts the highest pressure on local groundwater resources by over drafting several questions arise according to these approaches first how to determine the volume of reduction in the exploitation that does not harm the region s economy besides compensating for the drop in groundwater level does not harm the region s economy second how much should be the reduction of the area under cultivation that in addition to helping solve the aquifer problem does not have economic and social consequences the role of gof in this study was simultaneously considering the social economic and environmental effects of the approaches on the studied system which has reduced the responses of the dpsir framework to the following four scenarios reducing the total groundwater exploitation for the agricultural sector by at least 5 r1 the amount of reduction in the above scenario is 10 r2 reducing the area under cultivation by 10 to compensate for the shortage of groundwater resources c1 the amount of reduction in the above scenario is 20 c2 therefore the scenarios of the dpsir gof model were finalized for evaluation the purpose of defining these scenarios was to find the most practical policy to compensate for the decrease in groundwater level and create economic social and environmental security 3 2 modflow results technical and economic indicators were calculated using the modflow model groundwater simulation was performed using data from 40 observation wells in both steady and transient states at first the mean value of specific yield was determined by 10 for this aquifer according to the hydrodynamic coefficients of wells and the pumping test results it decreased to 5 in the northwest region reaching as high as 15 in the vicinity of the zayanderud river subsequently the mean initial specific yield was considered 10 according to the water balance report the mean hydraulic conductivity is 15 m d zayanderud river moving from southeast of the plain toward the north affects hydrological conditions and hydraulic conductivity may reach 27 m d in this part of the aquifer groundwater budget report najafabad study balance report isfahan regional water company 2016 consequently the initial hydraulic conductivity was assumed 15 m d hydraulic conductivity and aquifer specific yield were calibrated at the steady state september 2015 and the transient state september 2015 to august 2018 periods after calibration hydraulic conductivity was estimated between 1 5 m d to 38 m d the specific yield also was calibrated under transient conditions varying between 2 and 20 in different parts of the najafabad aquifer fig 5 finally the data for a year after the transient simulation period september 2018 to august 2019 was entered into the model for verification the errors of the model are brought in table 3 to evaluate the performance of the model the table shows that the model is capable of predicting groundwater levels fig 6 shows the stream lines in the najafabad aquifer fig 6 a the bedrock elevation fig 6 b and modflow conceptual model fig 6 c in the najafabad aquifer the water table measurements at observation wells were also plotted with fig 7 containing two examples 3 3 technical indicators after defining and analyzing the frameworks changes in the driving forces of the crop under cultivation and water exploitation to prevent aquifer level drop and increase the system s social and economic security were proposed in the form of scenarios after calibration and verification of the mathematical model scenarios r1 r2 c1 and c2 were examined to predict groundwater resources future then the maps of level drop and drought of these scenarios after 30 years were drawn using the gms model output fig 8 also si was calculated using the results of the modflow model and eqs 1 and 2 the results are shown in table 4 for the scenarios and in a situation where no scenario governs the system conditions the optimal values of si are values close to 1 according to the table scenario r2 resulted in a more improvement of si than other scenarios followed by scenarios r1 c2 and c1 respectively 3 4 economic indicators cpd and bpd indicators in the najafabad area are presented in table 4 according to the table cpd was highly affected by scenarios c2 and c1 respectively and the lowest cpd value was observed for scenario r2 on the other hand bpd is the highest in scenario r2 and decreases in c1 and c2 its lowest value was observed in the situation where no scenario was implemented in the region therefore based on pi the influential factors in improving cpd and bpd were reducing cultivation area and reducing exploitation respectively the second economic indicator investigated in this study was cba the results of cba were obtained with drought and aquifer level drop in the next 30 years which are shown in the form of drought maps in fig 8 during the analysis the red areas were not included in the calculations due to their complete dryness and unprofitability accordingly the total costs of green and yellow areas including drilling costs agricultural costs including planting maintenance and harvesting and energy consumption costs eq 3 as well as the total benefit of selling agricultural products were calculated for each scenario table 4 again a fixed cost was considered for drilling during the study period as the amount of water available to farmers decreased due to increasing annual drop and reducing their annual benefits and increasing costs over the period the b c ratio showed a decreasing trend in all scenarios due to the higher drop this ratio had a lower value in the yellow areas than the green areas this means that as the drop increased energy consumption costs for pumping water in exploitation wells increased consequently as the water level decreased the amount of water available to farmers to produce agricultural products decreased table 4 shows that scenario r2 resulted in the highest performance and profitability 4 discussion recently several comprehensive assessments based on conceptual models including groundwater and welfare framework katuva et al 2020 a framework for ecological responses to groundwater regime alteration kath et al 2018 have been presented for aquifers rushton 2004 although in recent years several studies have been conducted based on management frameworks such as dpsir and gof the comprehensive framework of dpsir and gof is a new issue that was defined in 2019 for the first time marzieh samareh hashemi et al 2019 since these frameworks cannot prioritize proposed scenarios it has been suggested to couple these frameworks with other methods to resolve this problem kelble et al 2013 elliott et al 2017 chandrakumar and mclaren 2018 the state of the najafabad aquifer system in the dpsir framework according to fig 9 is the groundwater level the aquifer is directly affected by the exploitation for various sectors but also other mechanisms such as climate change have significant impacts on the water level motamedi et al 2021 groundwater budget report najafabad study balance report isfahan regional water company 2016 by examining the evaporation temperature and precipitation of the aquifer in the study period it was found that all three had their roles in reducing the inflow to the aquifer as a pressure that has changed the system s state exploitation is also affected by the three sectors of agriculture drinking and industry in the agricultural sector alone groundwater exploitation has grown by 53 47 in the last decade the increase in consumption in the farm sector is influenced by the area s drivers under cultivation and the cultivation pattern the driver of the area under cultivation increased by 9 40 from 2005 to 2015 in dividing the cultivation pattern into two categories horticulture and agronomy it was found that each of them decreased by 10 75 and 10 respectively there has been an increase in harvest in the agricultural sector but production per unit area has reduced the excess water that is consumed over the years has been used for the additional area under cultivation while the efficiencies have not only not been in the direction of improvement but have also been decreasing the downward trend of production per unit area is quite significant on the other hand according to the gof analysis policies such as increasing bank facilities to the agricultural sector are not effective and it seems necessary to change the mechanisms in other words production efficiency has decreased due to the increase in water consumption fig 9 this means that increasing the area under cultivation to increase crop production has been practically ineffective as a result reducing the quantity and quality of agricultural products can endanger the region s economic security in the industrial sector the growth of industrial units has increased by 58 8 on the other hand the two factors of population and per capita consumption indicates the exploitation amount in the drinking sector which has increased by more than 100 with a 14 5 increase in population in recent years the effects of groundwater shortage are land subsidence migration and poverty in the region studies have shown a severe need to create job opportunities due to rural urban migration in recent years and the population growth of 14 5 therefore one of the proposed solutions to improve the conditions is changing the employment patterns however based on gof it is not logical to consider the migration index to urban areas due to changes in employment infrastructure and the groundwater level index although changing the employment patterns has sound effects on the groundwater level it might lead to an additional burden of rural urban migration and social and environmental problems due to population growth another suggestion is to change the cultivation pattern by studying the crops wheat and paddy were introduced as the region s two dominant and water consuming crops therefore eliminating cultivations with high water consumption and low economic efficiency can reduce consumption and water exploitation on the other hand although some crops consume less water their added value is minimal compared to products that consume more water therefore considering the two factors of groundwater level and agricultural income at the same time is of particular importance the investigation of drought maps and si in the study area showed that scenario r2 could remarkably prevent the destruction of the aquifer and help its recovery during the simulation period however the impact of other scenarios was much less therefore based on this indicator reducing water exploitation from groundwater resources by one half of the reservoir deficit in the long term runs can be suggested to policymakers and farmers to maintain the aquifer s balance moreover the results of the scenarios based on cba and pi indicators also confirmed the effects of scenario r2 i e a 10 reduction in the amount of exploitation more than those of other scenarios in contrast the study of cpd showed that the scenarios of the reduced area under cultivation had the highest performance compared to the scenarios involving the reduced water exploitation volume which is an important finding according to the literature the response of groundwater systems similar to the present study is in the form of policy making and management of groundwater exploitation tariff reform indirect pricing of groundwater resources raising awareness of farmers and adopting special measures to restrict agricultural activities to illustrate given that employment in the farming sector in this region is by far more than other parts creating job opportunities in the industrial and service sectors and encouraging the labor force to work in these sectors instead of agricultural activities can be indispensable policy in this region furthermore rational determination of agricultural water resources for management and control of groundwater exploitation by farmers increasing the level of education and raising public knowledge of different people in the community about the importance of groundwater resources and clarifying the dependence of regional life on groundwater resources can also be effective management approaches are usually general and conceptual frameworks do not provide guidelines for quantifying responses and prioritizing them therefore in some studies recommendations have been made for using frameworks combined with other models in this study the system s responses were in the form of reducing the aquifer exploitation and the area under cultivation in the region and their prioritization with the help of economic and technical indicators to obtain sustainable groundwater resources systems and maintain economic and social security 5 conclusion the dpsir framework and gof have been developed in this study dpsir is a framework involving the past and present information of the groundwater system while gof can assess the future status of it in other words the dpsir framework alone is associated with significant disadvantages including the lack of considering all dimensions of time economic and social dimensions therefore using the gof framework in this research can achieve a complete and integrated point of view of the system by considering all aspects of sustainable development however since using the dpsir framework alone cannot ensure the economic and social security of stakeholders and the system conceptualization is highly unlikely to be integrated with the help of this framework the mathematical model development through simulation and analysis of scenarios with the help of economic and technical indicators and the dpsir gof framework also helped to compare the scenarios quantitatively according to the results the effects of the two groups of basic policies of reducing the aquifer exploitation and the area under cultivation on solving the problems of the najafabad aquifer system have determined the direction of future policies it was found that the applicable scenario was a 10 reduction in groundwater exploitation which in most cases had the best effects on the najafabad aquifer system this scenario can prevent the critical situation of water shortage significantly in the future it also guarantees the health and well being of humans and the environment by compensating for groundwater loss resulting in economic and social health and security it is worth mentioning that there are some other scenarios on the side of providing alternative sources to irrigation namely artificial recharge and rainwater harvesting that can be considered in the scenario definition process the study of the effect of the proposed approaches in the future can be performed with social indicators technical and economic indicators in addition mcdm and ahp can also be used to understand better the effect of scenarios in each dimension of sustainable development funding this research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public commercial or not for profit sectors
