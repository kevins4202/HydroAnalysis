14380,wastewater treatment and low energy consumption are two important environmental issues in this work a challenging treatment problem of leather industry wastewater is chosen as a case study to combine the issue of energy and treatment efficiency using a common denominator of oxygen demand tannery wastewater is known for its highly contaminated structure due to the acidic nature of the effluent conventional methods do not perform well for tannery wastes so an electrochemical process is a reasonable approach for the problem since electrochemical reactors use electricity the energy efficiency of such plants should be simultaneously considered for overall sustainability the electricity production partially results in carbon footprints and consumption of oxygen in this work the electrochemical treatment results were assessed through total chromium removal and chemical oxygen demand cod reduction as expected the electrochemical process parameters reactor types electrode variations electrical current density etc as well as the process duration affect the treatment performance meanwhile these parameters also affect energy consumption although the energy consumption has been previously researched i the oxygen equivalent of the required energy and ii oxygen demand reduction of the wastewater were not considered simultaneously before in this work the used energy is represented in terms of consumed oxygen at the current electric generation profile in turkey and in usa it is argued that as the consumed energy increases the consumed oxygen also increases causing a separate pollution in terms of cod and other indirect effects the combined production consumption profiles as well as energy efficient parameter settings are investigated by experiments it is observed that the combined oxygen demand i e reduced on the treatment side and increased at the power generation side starts exhibiting an overall increase at early treatment stages for example at an electrical current setting of 20 ma cm2 and ph of 7 using electro coagulation with aluminum electrodes treatment reaches to 82 cod removal from 1024 mg l to 180 71 mg l at 8 33 kwh m3 corresponding to consuming 3 23 g l oxygen at average energy production settings in turkey the oxygen consumption using electro fenton exhibits similar results the necessity of renewable energy utilization or an earlier treatment termination is concluded keywords leather industry wastewater wastewater treatment electric energy efficiency cod removal 1 introduction due to the high amount of contaminating chemicals and biological residues during its production process leather industry wastewater must be treated effectively there has been a deep interest in various treatment techniques for tannery wastewater particularly via electrochemical methods 1 14 recently utilization of geopolymers and other materials with adsorption and filtering properties has become a popular approach yet electrochemical treatment stays to be a popular method that has been adopted by several treatment applications including tanneries consequently the literature of electrochemical wastewater treatment is quite large although electro fenton is a common practice in various wastewater treatment cases 33 35 its application to tannery wastewater is relatively few the physics behind electro fenton process can be reviewed from the works in 13 14 24 particularly the significance of ph value and contaminant concentration was thoroughly analyzed in 31 for electro fenton treatment of wastewater the fenton process depends on the reaction of fe 2 ion with h2o2 which produces hydroxyl radicals detailed chemical reaction explanations and the mechanism can be found in 33 35 the simple reaction list can be summarized as follows 1 o2 2h 2e h2o2 hydrogen peroxide production 2 fe 3 e fe 2 3 fe 2 h2o2 fe 3 oh oh 4 fe 3 h2o2 fe 2 ooh h eventually the strong hydroxyl radicals provide the system with the necessary bonding for organic and inorganic chemicals which eventually reduces the chemical oxygen demand as well as various heavy metals the advantage of electro fenton is its ability to gradually produce hydroxyl radicals the success of this approach was previously proven in several treatment cases including chromium removal 36 humic acid removal 37 winery wastewater treatment 35 organic wastewater treatment 38 olive oil mill wastewater treatment 39 etc contrary to the relatively limited utilization of electro fenton treatment for tannery wastewater electrocoagulation is very commonly encountered it has been successfully used for removing cod bod oil and chromium in tannery wastewater 3 electrocoagulation does not require large doses of coagulants due to electrical oxidation and reduction phases and it is operationally as simple as the electro fenton method it is also reported to be efficient in removing very fine colloidal particles 3 the main chemical reactions that occur at aluminum electrodes during electrocoagulation process can be listed as at the anode aluminum oxidation occurs 5 al s al3 aq 3e at the cathode water reduction occurs 6 3h2o l 3e 3 2h2 g 3oh aq at acidic conditions 7 al3 aq 3h2o l al oh 3 s 3h aq at alkaline conditons 8 al3 aq 3oh aq al oh 3 s these reactions indicate that electrochemical coagulation cells are supplied to the metal present in water in electrocoagulation processes ph of wastewater electrolyte directly affects metal hydroxide compounds solubility at low ph aluminum anode generates cationic monomeric species such as al3 and al oh 3 the removal mechanisms of chromium by electrocoagulation or electro fenton are nested processes active cr iv reduces to cr3 via different equations depending on ph levels and the oxidation process the complete set of the above removal reactions can be found in 23 24 detailed explanations about various applications of electrocoagulation standalone or combined with other techniques can be found in 1 12 all the listed works agree that despite the large economic input of leather industry direct disposal of its wastewater is intolerable for the environment particularly for the water quality standards in 25 it was reported that as of 2013 the tannery industry produces over 300 million tons of yearly wastewater and 64 320 tons of yearly sludge in the world this number is expected to increase with production growth beyond the cod and heavy metal removal performances the electrical energy consumption of electrochemical treatment processes had also been investigated in the literature in most cases the electrical energy consumption is reported at the end of the process the optimal duration of the process was first investigated in 1 5 in 15 a detailed review about electrocoagulation in wastewater treatment was presented for various wastewater types under a wide range of parametric conditions the acceptable ranges of treatment results were reported to vary between 0 5 and 80 kwh kg removal depending on the application and removal parameters or 0 5 30 kwh m3 wastewater treatment for organic wastewaters such as wastes of food industry 16 reports 0 2 640 kwh kg cod energy consumption rates depending on the applied electrical current and waste type for similar organic wastewaters 20 reports an energy consumption of 7 4 kwh kg cod 21 reports energy consumption of 1 75 kwh m3 22 reports a consumption of 0 50 kwh g ammonia for dye manufacturing wastewaters the required energy was reported as 51 320 kwh kg cod in 17 the oil refinery wastewater treatment was reported to require around a huge 200 kwh l energy consumption 18 13 kwh g cod 19 46 kwh m3 22 in all these studies including our own experiments the electricity consumptions are calculated according to the measured electric parameters duration treatment volume and contaminant reduction as given in 23 the common points in the works that consider energy consumption are that they calculate the energy consumption at the end of the treatment process and give a single figure to represent the energy efficiency either in kwh volume of treated wastewater or in kwh mass of eliminated contamination indicator i e cod give the consumed energy in kwh but do not consider what could be the footprint of the reported energy consumption in terms of carbon emission or oxygen demand the work herein proposes a novel methodology to constitute an alternative and efficient way to look at the electrochemical treatment by continuously monitoring the energy consumption during the whole treatment process and by converting the electrical energy consumption to the compatible measure of oxygen demand which enables us to assess equivalent terms i e cod the approach is expected to tell us how much average oxygen we demand at the energy production side in order to eliminate a unit amount of oxygen demand at the treatment side conversion of energy consumption kwh into the demanded oxygen amount for the energy generation requires the knowledge of energy generation profile in the particular country of interest normally a combination of all electric power sources will contribute to the overall consumption each energy source has its own oxygen consumption or carbon emission per kwh depending on the overall ratios of these individual energy source types an average oxygen demand per kwh for the country can be achieved 26 even for non fossil fuel based electric generation systems such as hydro electric plants nuclear plants and renewable energy plants an equivalent effective carbon emission or oxygen consumption rate has been evaluated 27 28 the most current co2 emission averages per kwh can be obtained from public reports of eia wea or iea 29 31 a recent electrical energy source distribution study regarding the situation in turkey can be found in 32 using the proportions of that study with standard generation efficiency assumptions it was observed that one kwh of electric energy currently causes 0 534 kg of co2 equivalent as compared to the usa cost of 0 600 kg these results are also in total accordance with the turkish national greenhouse gas emission report 1990 2009 using atomic mass ratios the oxygen demand can be calculated as 0 388 kg oxygen kwh this number is of course valid in the case that the used electricity is supplied by the mains connected to the regular electric grid in the country more detailed explanations experimental set up details observations and conclusions are presented in the rest of the paper 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample acquisition treatment regularizations and experimental set ups the experiments were conducted over actual tannery wastewater samples that are obtained from a leather manufacturing and processing factory in i̇zmir turkey the samples were collected in polypropylene bottles and stored in a refrigerator at 277 k until experiments on par with iso 5667 1 2007 en iso 5667 1 ac 2007 iso 5667 3 2012 iso 5667 10 2002 standards the wastewater was measured to have a cod value of about 1000 mg l 1 total chromium concentration of about 1200 mg l 1 a conductivity of close to 46 ms cm 1 and an initial ph value near to 4 the team has worked on a detailed suit of analyses about electrochemical methods that are applied to tannery wastewater under various testing conditions including ph current density electrode type etc the optimum process conditions are sought after besides the achieved results were compared to the national standards for leather production facilities which urges the treatment plant to have the following upper limits table 1 for both of the electrochemical experiment suits electro fenton and electrocoagulation we used h2so4 merch germany and naoh merch germany for adjusting the initial ph levels of the tannery wastewater the ph and conductivity of the wastewater were measured using ph and conductivity meter thermo scientific orion star a215 model usa the experiments were conducted constantly at room temperature with a cylindrical glass reactor of 500 ml on a magnetic stirrer falc instruments f60 model italy working at a stirring speed of 300 rpm a current controlled dc power supply statron type 3262 0 5 a 0 80 v germany was used for injecting electricity to the electrodes in order to supply uniform electrochemical reactions pole chargers were used and electrode polarities were occasionally switched the electrochemical reactor structures were also kept identical for fair comparison six plates of aluminum and iron were used three connected as anodes and three as cathodes the total vertically immersed area of both anode and cathode electrodes was 100 cm2 at 4 cm depth with between electrode distance of 0 3 cm every time an experiment ended the electrode surfaces were always rinsed with diluted hcl solution and distilled water additionally h2o2 was supplied for the electro fenton experiments we must emphasize that the production energy costs of hydrogen peroxide or diluted acid base chemicals are unknown by the researchers therefore their effects have been ignored in energy oxygen demand analysis for each experiment the batch processes were kept to last a maximum of 50 min with 10 min sampling intervals for analysis the samples were taken 5 ml in volume a centrifuge system nüve nf 800 r turkey was used at 7000 rpm for 5 min to eliminate sludge formation total chromium concentration was analyzed with agilent 8800 icp triple quadrupole usa icp ms the residual cod concentrations were determined using a cod reactor merck spectroquant tr 420 germany according to open reflux method turkish standard 2010 all cod analyses were carried out multiple of times and average values were recorded removal efficiency was calculated as the percent cod removal as compared to the initial cod value the experiments were repeated three times for every fixed ph and electrical current density setting the ph values were adjusted to be 3 98 original ph of the wastewater 7 and 9 tested electrical current densities were 10 20 and 30 ma cm2 considering two types of reactors a total of 2 3 3 3 54 experiments with durations of 1 h for the process and excess time for preparation cod chromium determination cleaning etc were conducted observed parameters and results were recorded it was observed that variation of ph sec 3 1 and electrical current density sec 3 2 both alter the treatment and energy consumption performance 2 2 electro fenton experiments the first set of electrochemical treatment experiments were conducted via electro fenton process classically two different fenton reactor types could be used by using metal electrodes with added h2o2 or by gradually adding fe ii and h2o2 to the system for reaction in this work we used batch processing of wastewater with ion reactors containing iron plate electrodes the electrical approach while gradually adding or electrochemically producing h2o2 to the system in our experiments we have used parallel plate iron electro fenton reactors that are connected to an electrical power supply the power supply is selected to provide controlled and constant current ma the plates are submerged into the wastewater tank with a stirrer attached to the bottom the initial ph values were controlled by additional h2so4 or naoh according to whether acidity or alkalinity was aimed the experimental setup can be illustrated as in fig 1 treatment success results and comparisons with the alternative electrochemical method electrocoagulation with aluminum electrodes will be presented in sec 3 2 3 electrocoagulation experiments aluminum electrode the energy efficiency analysis and operating point determination of electrochemical processes require a wide range of experimentation with several electrode types however we chose electrocoagulation with aluminum electrodes as the alternative to the iron plate electro fenton to keep the presentation compact coagulation and electrocoagulation are in fact quite popular methods in tannery wastewater treatment 1 12 in our experimental electrocoagulation processes we used aluminum anode to generate coagulants in situ by electrically dissolving metal from electrodes therefore a reactor structure that is very similar to the electro fenton experimental set up is used fig 1 the metal ions cations are consumed at anode and hydrogen gas is evolved from cathode for pollutant removal by flotation the reaction details are explained in the introduction part of this paper an issue that deserves attention is the passivation problem of aluminium electrode because with the use of this system electrode surface is covered with passive layer therefore the efficiency decreases in this study a pole changer device is incorporated to avoid passivation 3 experimental results after constructing the described experimental set ups several 54 runs of experiments were conducted treatment and energy consumption results for electrocoagulation and electro fenton together with the observed effects of ph and electrical current density are reported in this section in order to keep the manuscript compact the effect of ph is presented at the overall best current density of 20 ma cm2 and the effect of current density is presented at a fixed ph value of 7 the experimental repetitions are averaged and the measurement variances are reported the graphs are plotted at the mean measurement points it must be noted that this paper also proposes consideration of a novel oxygen demand equivalent of consumed energy the overall oxygen demand idea its decrease increase model and the corresponding observations are presented separately in sec 4 3 1 effects of ph on efficiency the acid alkaline value of the wastewater is naturally expected to affect the electrolysis and removal efficiency through various mechanisms 23 first of all it affects the stability of the formed hydroxide formations besides it can modify the charge particles along the surface and therefore affect the removal of colloidal organics from the solution 23 for both ferrous and aluminum ion solutions hydrolysis and electrolysis would differently target a predominant ph value hence the initial ph value of the process is expected to alter the removal efficiency in terms of both total cr removal and cod removal in our experiments apart from the original acidic ph of the tannery wastewater ph 3 97 two other initial ph values neutral ph 7 and slightly alkaline ph 9 were selected in order to observe their effects on treatment obviously the ph value varies as the treatment process is performed in time however each experiment was repeated with the same initial ph settings the effect of ph alteration was tested using electrocoagulation and electro fenton with analogous electrode structures at an electrical current density of 20 00 ma cm2 once a reasonable ph setting is obtained that value is fixed and the electrical current density was varied as 10 00 20 00 and 30 00 ma cm2 to see its effect in subsection 3 2 the total chromium removal and cod removal performances in time of electrocoagulation by using aluminum electrode are displayed in fig 2 a and b respectively for the chromium density measurements the standard deviation of 3 experiment repetitions at the end of the processes were calculated as 3 2 in electrocoagulation and 2 3 in electro fenton for the cod measurements the standard deviation of 3 experiment repetitions at the end of the processes were 14 in electrocoagulation and 11 for electro fenton comparing these deviations with the average measurements a consistent set of results were achieved several observations can be made according to these results for electrocoagulation the acidic medium of the original wastewater ph seems to adversely affect the treatment whereas for electro fenton the original ph does not seem to harm the treatment efficiency on the contrary the cod removal slightly suffers from high alkalinity in electro fenton interestingly it is difficult to argue a persistent rule of thumb for ph preference however due to the reasonable overall performance we selected a neutral ph value of 7 for the rest of the reported experiments for consistency it must be noted that these results are not per kwh that is consumed throughout the process the same graphs will be drawn over a horizontal axis of energy consumption kwh m3 in sec 3 where the oxygen demand or carbon emission effect of the consumed electric energy could be incorporated over the graph in this section the final energy consumptions could be discussed as follows using electrocoagulation the total energy consumption was 7 75 kwh m3 at ph 3 97 and 8 33 kwh m3 at ph 7 these values can also be converted to kwh kg cod as 6 5 kwh kg cod at ph 3 97 and 7 kwh kg cod at ph 7 compared to the average energy consumption 15 40 kwh m3 during electrochemical treatment of food industry wastewater 16 or higher for oil and dye manufacturing wastewaters 17 22 these energy consumption levels are in fact quite low besides these levels are completely on par with the average of the literature 1 12 interestingly although ph 7 performs better in terms of total chromium or cod removal within the same tame period it spends more electric energy therefore a question of which case is more overall efficient arises as a comparison although cod removal of electro fenton is visibly more effective than electrocoagulation it causes a high electric energy consumption of 10 46 kwh m3 at ph 3 97 whereas the consumption significantly drops down to 6 93 kwh m3 at ph 7 making this ph value even a more desirable setting these energy consumption levels are also less than or equal to the levels reported in 14 16 19 for other treatment applications of electro fenton 3 2 effects of electric current density on removal efficiency in both electrocoagulation and electro fenton the current density ma cm2 has an obvious effect on treatment efficiency in this subsection the initial ph values were fixed at a value of 7 and the current densities were varied as 10 00 20 00 and 30 00 ma cm2 following the graphs in figs 4 and 5 it can be seen that a current density of 20 00 ma cm2 is an overall reasonable setting for best performance therefore in fact the experiments in subsection 3 1 were carried out with that current density value although the higher current density of 30 00 ma cm2 also provides plausible treatment performance the corresponding energy consumption jumps to 12 5 kwh m3 from 8 kwh m3 for 20 ma cm2 in electrocoagulation and to 14 56 kwh m3 from 6 92 kwh m3 for 20 ma cm2 in electro fenton which causes the favoring for the electrical current density of 20 00 ma cm2 the energy consumption for these experiments depends on the instantaneous resistance of the aqueous solution as 9 e i r 2 t therefore although the current value can be fixed the conductance or conversely the resistance is a parameter dependent on contamination and it also varies during treatment eventually it is difficult to estimate the consumed energy value instead we have monitored the consumption through both voltage and current recordings during our experiments for analysis purposes as discussed in sec 3 1 the final energy consumption levels are around 7 14 kwh m3 which are comparable or less than the reported electric energy consumption reports throughout the literature 1 12 15 23 particularly wastewaters with organic contamination such as food industry and agriculture and wastewaters of oil and dye producers require up to ten folds of the energy consumption levels reported here 4 energy consumption equivalent oxygen demand for consumed energy although most of the electrochemical treatment reports mention about the consumed energy and even its economic fiscal value 40 42 at the end of the process the oxygen demand equivalent approach to the consumed energy is a novel contribution of this work since the proposed scheme uses electricity for the treatment of wastewater a proportional amount of co2 is emitted to the atmosphere for each kwh energy used proportionally a fraction of oxygen is consumed from the atmosphere it is therefore necessary to monitor how much energy is consumed for each unit of cod reduction and simultaneously convert the energy to an oxygen equivalent for example if the process requires m kwh for elimination of 1 kg of cod and if the utilized electricity causes an oxygen consumption of n kg per generated kwh then logic requires that n m must be less than 1 kg of oxygen for a reasonable attempt to treatment otherwise it would mean that for each reduced cod at the treatment site even more oxygen is demanded at the energy generation side rendering the process questionable in order to make this analysis the oxygen consumption n per produced kwh must be estimated according to a recent electrical energy source distribution study 32 the power sources can be visualized as in fig 6 once the contribution from coal and natural gas are considered the equivalent co2 emission per kwh can be obtained as 0 534 kg as a comparison the same co2 emission in usa is around 0 600 kg according to eia reports using the molecular mass formula it can be easily seen that 32 44 of the co2 mass corresponds to oxygen by calculation 10 n 0 534 32 44 0 388 kg kwh 388g kwh of oxygen in mass per consumed energy for the treatment in turkey this rate can be compared with the values of energy consumption that we have obtained in our experiments depending on the fenton coagulation process ph values and applied current densities the required energy for eliminating 90 of 1 g l cod was measured between 4 and 14 kwh m3 these numbers can be balanced in the common denominator as 0 004 0 014 kwh l or 0 0044 0 0155 kwh g cod multiplying these kwh rates with the oxygen equivalent for production n we get 388 0 0044 1 72 388 0 0155 6 35 both of these values are larger than 1 meaning that the overall process requires more than 1 g of oxygen to reduce 1 g of cod the above observation provides a novel insight to the phenomenon of energy consumption during electrochemical treatment if the cod decrease is considered as the treatment issue the process must consider simultaneous oxygen bonding during electricity generation as a second novel contribution of this work it is proposed that one does not need to consider the consumption only at the end of the process in fact the cod and energy consumption levels must be continuously monitored and one should not let the process to go beyond a certain duration of treatment the critical time threshold for treatment is when the amount of oxygen bonding for electric consumption overshoots the marginal decrease in oxygen demand in the treated wastewater the concept is described as an illustration in fig 7 the proposed model shows that the cod levels must be plotted as a function of used kwh where a linear oxygen consumption effect may be simply added to the oxygen function to find an optimal point in terms of oxygen demand for example in fig 7 the bonded oxygen in mass linearly increases as a function of produced energy at a rate of 0 534 32 44 0 388 kg kwh in mass per consumed energy practically the slope of this red line is fairly steep and there is a huge necessity of very quick and efficient electrochemical treatment systems if more renewable energy is produced in a country or if the proposed electrochemical treatment plant is located near to a renewable energy generator the rate slope of this red line could be smaller or even zero in this work we made the assumption that the treatment plant uses electricity that is plugged directly to the mains of a grid connected building in turkey obviously cod is not the only contamination parameter for treatment applications for example in tannery wastewaters chromium is a highly toxic and commonly encountered chemical that requires careful treatment but figs 2 4 and fig 5 a shows that the chromium elimination is quickly saturated at around 10 min if the processes were terminated at 10 min very reasonable chromium removals would be obtained while the cod reduction per l would be 400 mg with an oxygen demand cost at electric production side as low as 1 72 6 286 mg making the system an overall efficient one in order to better visualize the reasonable operation range cod removal performances of electrocoagulation and electro fenton treatment per utilized electric energy are shown in fig 8a and b for various current density settings the electricity production oxygen demand lines per utilized kwh are overlaid red lines on the graphs with a slope of 388 mg kwh l in fig 8a the electrocoagulation reactor treatment characteristic shows that although time wise performance at 10 00 ma cm2 current density stays small its performance per consumed energy hence per consumed oxygen is more efficient as compared to higher currents the lower going blue curve in fact despite their quick treatments higher current values seem to be more inefficient than low current densities in terms of per energy treatment the graphs show that spending energies over 1 2 kwh m3 is technically inefficient for cod reduction interestingly the energy efficiency property of low current densities is not the case in electro fenton the lowest going hence the most energy efficient treatment appears to be at 20 00 ma cm2 electric current density again the applicable energy consumption range is not over 1 2 kwh m3 the difference between these two behaviours imply that special care must be given to each proposed electrochemical treatment method by experimenting according to energy consumption for comparison the reported energy consumptions in 1 12 15 23 are all beyond the efficient consumption limit causing more oxygen to be consumed for electric production during reduction of cod these operating curves may be expected to differ further for various electrode types such as bdd ti irox etc consequently conduction of test experiments is recommended to observe these behaviours prior to installing actual treatment plants 5 conclusions and discussions in this work we have presented a case study of tannery wastewater treatment in order to illustrate the energy issues in electrochemical treatment since the eventual aim of wastewater treatment is to attain a clean and sustainable environment special interest must be paid to utilization electrical energy for the process it must be noted that an important portion of classical electricity power plants use fossil fuels for generating electricity whenever we plug our reactors to the mains of a building we cause a certain amount of co2 emission therefore it is not only an economical issue to spend energy in previous studies the economical aspects of spending certain energies and certain materials were carefully investigated 40 42 however a compatible oxygen demand equation is proposed for the first time in this work where the reduction in cod at the treatment site is compared to the amount of oxygen necessary to produce the electrical energy at the power generation side if this new aspect is kept in mind an environmentally friendly treatment plant must also consider energy efficiency of the process through an explicit oxygen balance equation this balance has two perspectives how much oxygen demand are we causing while trying to reduce the chemical oxygen demand of the wastewater at which energy consumption level do we need to stop and what are the optimal electrochemical reactor settings electrode selection ph current density etc for best treatment per consumed energy not necessarily treatment speed the answer to the first perspective i was sought after using an equivalent oxygen bonding amount to compensate the cod reduction at the wastewater treatment side a novel operation curve fig 7 is proposed to illustrate the linear increase of oxygen bonding as a function of utilized energy over where cod reduction can be plotted as in fig 8 the addition of oxygen curves produces a first decreasing then increasing pattern it is explained that the sign change in the slope is the point where the cod removal treatment must logically stop experimental results show that treatment for over 10 20 min already overshoots the efficient point for cod reduction so the process must be terminated at about 15 min fortunately the chromium removal already reaches to a saturation at these process times as a comparison the whole electrochemical treatment experimental results that are reported in the literature and mentioned in the introduction wildly overshoots the critical efficiency point of oxygen demand i e the sweet spot unfortunately since these papers only report the electrical energy consumption and do not provide an equivalent oxygen demand it had been difficult to come up with this observation this shows that the described efficiency analysis must be applied to other treatment applications too obviously the treatment of heavy metals is a very different issue their removal is separately critical as compared to simple cod removal in such cases it must be emphasized that the carbon emission of the electricity generation may not be as impactful or important as the elimination of such poisonous metals therefore the process must of course continue as long as necessary for the elimination of heavy metals down the regulation limits as a final remark regarding the perspective i the proposed analysis is valid only for an average electricity production profile of the country if the treatment plant installs a self sufficient renewable energy generation system consisting of solar pv panels and or wind turbines at a meteorologically suitable geographical location then the oxygen cost for producing each kwh energy would be practically zero in that case the above analysis would be unnecessary and the system could continue electrochemical treatment as long as desired the answer to the second perspective ii is easily attained through simple experiments that show treatment per kwh i e fig 7 interestingly we were unable to observe a consistent rule about parameter settings in electrochemical treatment similar situations are observed in different treatment applications in the literature in the aluminum electrode electrocoagulation case lower electric current density values seem to perform with higher energy efficiency fig 8a whereas that observation was not valid in electro fenton with iron electrodes fig 8b a similarly mixed set of results were available about the efficiency of the reactors under different ph conditions eventually we conclude that a thorough set of experiments is necessary for checking and observing combinations of parameters at different values for example testing at ph 3 5 7 etc and at each ph testing with a current density of 10 20 30 etc ma cm2 because different electrodes and different wastewater structures may not have a common parametric behavior testing these observations with different electrodes i e bdd ti irox etc different reactor styles i e raschig rings continuous process half cells etc and different wastewater cases i e agricultural urban etc may be listed as possible future study directions of this research acknowledgments this work has been supported in parts by the scientific and

14380,wastewater treatment and low energy consumption are two important environmental issues in this work a challenging treatment problem of leather industry wastewater is chosen as a case study to combine the issue of energy and treatment efficiency using a common denominator of oxygen demand tannery wastewater is known for its highly contaminated structure due to the acidic nature of the effluent conventional methods do not perform well for tannery wastes so an electrochemical process is a reasonable approach for the problem since electrochemical reactors use electricity the energy efficiency of such plants should be simultaneously considered for overall sustainability the electricity production partially results in carbon footprints and consumption of oxygen in this work the electrochemical treatment results were assessed through total chromium removal and chemical oxygen demand cod reduction as expected the electrochemical process parameters reactor types electrode variations electrical current density etc as well as the process duration affect the treatment performance meanwhile these parameters also affect energy consumption although the energy consumption has been previously researched i the oxygen equivalent of the required energy and ii oxygen demand reduction of the wastewater were not considered simultaneously before in this work the used energy is represented in terms of consumed oxygen at the current electric generation profile in turkey and in usa it is argued that as the consumed energy increases the consumed oxygen also increases causing a separate pollution in terms of cod and other indirect effects the combined production consumption profiles as well as energy efficient parameter settings are investigated by experiments it is observed that the combined oxygen demand i e reduced on the treatment side and increased at the power generation side starts exhibiting an overall increase at early treatment stages for example at an electrical current setting of 20 ma cm2 and ph of 7 using electro coagulation with aluminum electrodes treatment reaches to 82 cod removal from 1024 mg l to 180 71 mg l at 8 33 kwh m3 corresponding to consuming 3 23 g l oxygen at average energy production settings in turkey the oxygen consumption using electro fenton exhibits similar results the necessity of renewable energy utilization or an earlier treatment termination is concluded keywords leather industry wastewater wastewater treatment electric energy efficiency cod removal 1 introduction due to the high amount of contaminating chemicals and biological residues during its production process leather industry wastewater must be treated effectively there has been a deep interest in various treatment techniques for tannery wastewater particularly via electrochemical methods 1 14 recently utilization of geopolymers and other materials with adsorption and filtering properties has become a popular approach yet electrochemical treatment stays to be a popular method that has been adopted by several treatment applications including tanneries consequently the literature of electrochemical wastewater treatment is quite large although electro fenton is a common practice in various wastewater treatment cases 33 35 its application to tannery wastewater is relatively few the physics behind electro fenton process can be reviewed from the works in 13 14 24 particularly the significance of ph value and contaminant concentration was thoroughly analyzed in 31 for electro fenton treatment of wastewater the fenton process depends on the reaction of fe 2 ion with h2o2 which produces hydroxyl radicals detailed chemical reaction explanations and the mechanism can be found in 33 35 the simple reaction list can be summarized as follows 1 o2 2h 2e h2o2 hydrogen peroxide production 2 fe 3 e fe 2 3 fe 2 h2o2 fe 3 oh oh 4 fe 3 h2o2 fe 2 ooh h eventually the strong hydroxyl radicals provide the system with the necessary bonding for organic and inorganic chemicals which eventually reduces the chemical oxygen demand as well as various heavy metals the advantage of electro fenton is its ability to gradually produce hydroxyl radicals the success of this approach was previously proven in several treatment cases including chromium removal 36 humic acid removal 37 winery wastewater treatment 35 organic wastewater treatment 38 olive oil mill wastewater treatment 39 etc contrary to the relatively limited utilization of electro fenton treatment for tannery wastewater electrocoagulation is very commonly encountered it has been successfully used for removing cod bod oil and chromium in tannery wastewater 3 electrocoagulation does not require large doses of coagulants due to electrical oxidation and reduction phases and it is operationally as simple as the electro fenton method it is also reported to be efficient in removing very fine colloidal particles 3 the main chemical reactions that occur at aluminum electrodes during electrocoagulation process can be listed as at the anode aluminum oxidation occurs 5 al s al3 aq 3e at the cathode water reduction occurs 6 3h2o l 3e

the oxidation process the complete set of the above removal reactions can be found in 23 24 detailed explanations about various applications of electrocoagulation standalone or combined with other techniques can be found in 1 12 all the listed works agree that despite the large economic input of leather industry direct disposal of its wastewater is intolerable for the environment particularly for the water quality standards in 25 it was reported that as of 2013 the tannery industry produces over 300 million tons of yearly wastewater and 64 320 tons of yearly sludge in the world this number is expected to increase with production growth beyond the cod and heavy metal removal performances the electrical energy consumption of electrochemical treatment processes had also been investigated in the literature in most cases the electrical energy consumption is reported at the end of the process the optimal duration of the process was first investigated in 1 5 in 15 a detailed review about electrocoagulation in wastewater treatment was presented for various wastewater types under a wide range of parametric conditions the acceptable ranges of treatment results were reported to vary between 0 5 and 80 kwh kg removal depending on the application and removal parameters or 0 5 30 kwh m3 wastewater treatment for organic wastewaters such as wastes of food industry 16 reports 0 2 640 kwh kg cod energy consumption rates depending on the applied electrical current and waste type for similar organic wastewaters 20 reports an energy consumption of 7 4 kwh kg cod 21 reports energy consumption of 1 75 kwh m3 22 reports a consumption of 0 50 kwh g ammonia for dye manufacturing wastewaters the required energy was reported as 51 320 kwh kg cod in 17 the oil refinery wastewater treatment was reported to require around a huge 200 kwh l energy consumption 18 13 kwh g cod 19 46 kwh m3 22 in all these studies including our own experiments the electricity consumptions are calculated according to the measured electric parameters duration treatment volume and contaminant reduction as given in 23 the common points in the works that consider energy consumption are that they calculate the energy consumption at the end of the treatment process and give a single figure to represent the energy efficiency either in kwh volume of treated wastewater or in kwh mass of eliminated contamination indicator i e cod give the consumed energy in kwh but do not consider what could be the footprint of the reported energy consumption in terms of carbon emission or oxygen demand the work herein proposes a novel methodology to constitute an alternative and efficient way to look at the electrochemical treatment by continuously monitoring the energy consumption during the whole treatment process and by converting the electrical energy consumption to the compatible measure of oxygen demand which enables us to assess equivalent terms i e cod the approach is expected to tell us how much average oxygen we demand at the energy production side in order to eliminate a unit amount of oxygen demand at the treatment side conversion of energy consumption kwh into the demanded oxygen amount for the energy generation requires the knowledge of energy generation profile in the particular country of interest normally a combination of all electric power sources will contribute to the overall consumption each energy source has its own oxygen consumption or carbon emission per kwh depending on the overall ratios of these individual energy source types an average oxygen demand per kwh for the country can be achieved 26 even for non fossil fuel based electric generation systems such as hydro electric plants nuclear plants and renewable energy plants an equivalent effective carbon emission or oxygen consumption rate has been evaluated 27 28 the most current co2 emission averages per kwh can be obtained from public reports of eia wea or iea 29 31 a recent electrical energy source distribution study regarding the situation in turkey can be found in 32 using the proportions of that study with standard generation efficiency assumptions it was observed that one kwh of electric energy currently causes 0 534 kg of co2 equivalent as compared to the usa cost of 0 600 kg these results are also in total accordance with the turkish national greenhouse gas emission report 1990 2009 using atomic mass ratios the oxygen demand can be calculated as 0 388 kg oxygen kwh this number is of course valid in the case that the used electricity is supplied by the mains connected to the regular electric grid in the country more detailed explanations experimental set up details observations and conclusions are presented in the rest of the paper 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample acquisition treatment regularizations and experimental set ups the experiments were conducted over actual tannery wastewater samples that are obtained from a leather manufacturing and processing factory in i̇zmir turkey the samples were collected in polypropylene bottles and stored in a refrigerator at 277 k until experiments on par with iso 5667 1 2007 en iso 5667 1 ac 2007 iso 5667 3 2012 iso 5667 10 2002 standards the wastewater was measured to have a cod value of about 1000 mg l 1 total chromium concentration of about 1200 mg l 1 a conductivity of close to 46 ms cm 1 and an initial ph value near to 4 the team has worked on a detailed suit of analyses about electrochemical methods that are applied to tannery wastewater under various testing conditions including ph current density electrode type etc the optimum process conditions are sought after besides the achieved results were compared to the national standards for leather production facilities which urges the treatment plant to have the following upper limits table 1 for both of the electrochemical experiment suits electro fenton and electrocoagulation we used h2so4 merch germany and naoh merch germany for adjusting the initial ph levels of the tannery wastewater the ph and conductivity of the wastewater were measured using ph and conductivity meter thermo scientific orion star a215 model usa the experiments were conducted constantly at room temperature with a cylindrical glass reactor of 500 ml on a magnetic stirrer falc instruments f60 model italy working at a stirring speed of 300 rpm a current controlled dc power supply statron type 3262 0 5 a 0 80 v germany was used for injecting electricity to the electrodes in order to supply uniform electrochemical reactions pole chargers were used and electrode polarities were occasionally switched the electrochemical reactor structures were also kept identical for fair comparison six plates of aluminum and iron were used three connected as anodes and three as cathodes the total vertically immersed area of both anode and cathode electrodes was 100 cm2 at 4 cm depth with between electrode distance of 0 3 cm every time an experiment ended the electrode surfaces were always rinsed with diluted hcl solution and distilled water additionally h2o2 was supplied for the electro fenton experiments we must emphasize that the production energy costs of hydrogen peroxide or diluted acid base chemicals are unknown by the researchers therefore their effects have been ignored in energy oxygen demand analysis for each experiment the batch processes were kept to last a maximum of 50 min with 10 min sampling intervals for analysis the samples were taken 5 ml in volume a centrifuge system nüve nf 800 r turkey was used at 7000 rpm for 5 min to eliminate sludge formation total chromium concentration was analyzed with agilent 8800 icp triple quadrupole usa icp ms the residual cod concentrations were determined using a cod reactor merck spectroquant tr 420 germany according to open reflux method turkish standard 2010 all cod analyses were carried out multiple of times and average values were recorded removal efficiency was calculated as the percent cod removal as compared to the initial cod value the experiments were repeated three times for every fixed ph and electrical current density setting the ph values were adjusted to be 3 98 original ph of the wastewater 7 and 9 tested electrical current densities were 10 20 and 30 ma cm2 considering two types of reactors a total of 2 3 3 3 54 experiments with durations of 1 h for the process and excess time for preparation cod chromium determination cleaning etc were conducted observed parameters and results were recorded it was observed that variation of ph sec 3 1 and electrical current density sec 3 2 both alter the treatment and energy consumption performance 2 2 electro fenton experiments the first set of electrochemical treatment experiments were conducted via electro fenton process classically two different fenton reactor types could be used by using metal electrodes with added h2o2 or by gradually adding fe ii and h2o2 to the system for reaction in this work we used batch processing of wastewater with ion reactors containing iron plate electrodes the electrical approach while gradually adding or electrochemically producing h2o2 to the system in our experiments we have used parallel plate iron electro fenton reactors that are connected to an electrical power supply the power supply is selected to provide controlled and constant current ma the plates are submerged into the wastewater tank with a stirrer attached to the bottom the initial ph values were controlled by additional h2so4 or naoh according to whether acidity or alkalinity was aimed the experimental setup can be illustrated as in fig 1 treatment success results and comparisons with the alternative electrochemical method electrocoagulation with aluminum electrodes will be presented in sec 3 2 3 electrocoagulation experiments aluminum electrode the energy efficiency analysis and operating point determination of electrochemical processes require a wide range of experimentation with several electrode types however we chose electrocoagulation with aluminum electrodes as the alternative to the iron plate electro fenton to keep the presentation compact coagulation and electrocoagulation are in fact quite popular methods in tannery wastewater treatment 1 12 in our experimental electrocoagulation processes we used aluminum anode to generate coagulants in situ by electrically dissolving metal from electrodes therefore a reactor structure that is very similar to the electro fenton experimental set up is used fig 1 the metal ions cations are consumed at anode and hydrogen gas is evolved from cathode for pollutant removal by flotation the reaction details are explained in the introduction part of this paper an issue that deserves attention is the passivation problem of aluminium electrode because with the use of this system electrode surface is covered with passive layer therefore the efficiency decreases in this study a pole changer device is incorporated to avoid passivation 3 experimental results after constructing the described experimental set ups several 54 runs of experiments were conducted treatment and energy consumption results for electrocoagulation and electro fenton together with the observed effects of ph and electrical current density are reported in this section in order to keep the manuscript compact the effect of ph is presented at the overall best current density of 20 ma cm2 and the effect of current density is presented at a fixed ph value of 7 the experimental repetitions are averaged and the measurement variances are reported the graphs are plotted at the mean measurement points it must be noted that this paper also proposes consideration of a novel oxygen demand equivalent of consumed energy the overall oxygen demand idea its decrease increase model and the corresponding observations are presented separately in sec 4 3 1 effects of ph on efficiency the acid alkaline value of the wastewater is naturally expected to affect the electrolysis and removal efficiency through various mechanisms 23 first of all it affects the stability of the formed hydroxide formations besides it can modify the charge particles along the surface and therefore affect the removal of colloidal organics from the solution 23 for both ferrous and aluminum ion solutions hydrolysis and electrolysis would differently target a predominant ph value hence the initial ph value of the process is expected to alter the removal efficiency in terms of both total cr removal and cod removal in our experiments apart from the original acidic ph of the tannery wastewater ph 3 97 two other initial ph values neutral ph 7 and slightly alkaline ph 9 were selected in order to observe their effects on treatment obviously the ph value varies as the treatment process is performed in time however each experiment was repeated with the same initial ph settings the effect of ph alteration was tested using electrocoagulation and electro fenton with analogous electrode structures at an electrical current density of 20 00 ma cm2 once a reasonable ph setting is obtained that value is fixed and the electrical current density was varied as 10 00 20 00 and 30 00 ma cm2 to see its effect in subsection 3 2 the total chromium removal and cod removal performances in time of electrocoagulation by using aluminum electrode are displayed in fig 2 a and b respectively for the chromium density measurements the standard deviation of 3 experiment repetitions at the end of the processes were calculated as 3 2 in electrocoagulation and 2 3 in electro fenton for the cod measurements the standard deviation of 3 experiment repetitions at the end of the processes were 14 in electrocoagulation and 11 for electro fenton comparing these deviations with the average measurements a consistent set of results were achieved several observations can be made according to these results for electrocoagulation the acidic medium of the original wastewater ph seems to adversely affect the treatment whereas for electro fenton the original ph does not seem to harm the treatment efficiency on the contrary the cod removal slightly suffers from high alkalinity in electro fenton interestingly it is difficult to argue a persistent rule of thumb for ph preference however due to the reasonable overall performance we selected a neutral ph value of 7 for the rest of the reported experiments for consistency it must be noted that these results are not per kwh that is consumed throughout the process the same graphs will be drawn over a horizontal axis of energy consumption kwh m3 in sec 3 where the oxygen demand or carbon emission effect of the consumed electric energy could be incorporated over the graph in this section the final energy consumptions could be discussed as follows using electrocoagulation the total energy consumption was 7 75 kwh m3 at ph 3 97 and 8 33 kwh m3 at ph 7 these values can also be converted to kwh kg cod as 6 5 kwh kg cod at ph 3 97 and 7 kwh kg cod at ph 7 compared to the average energy consumption 15 40 kwh m3 during electrochemical treatment of food industry wastewater 16 or higher for oil and dye manufacturing wastewaters 17 22 these energy consumption levels are in fact quite low besides these levels are completely on par with the average of the literature 1 12 interestingly although ph 7 performs better in terms of total chromium or cod removal within the same tame period it spends more electric energy therefore a question of which case is more overall efficient arises as a comparison although cod removal of electro fenton is visibly more effective than electrocoagulation it causes a high electric energy consumption of 10 46 kwh m3 at ph 3 97 whereas the consumption significantly drops down to 6 93 kwh m3 at ph 7 making this ph value even a more desirable setting these energy consumption levels are also less than or equal to the levels reported in 14 16 19 for other treatment applications of electro fenton 3 2 effects of electric current density on removal efficiency in both electrocoagulation and electro fenton the current density ma cm2 has an obvious effect on treatment efficiency in this subsection the initial ph values were fixed at a value of 7 and the current densities were varied as 10 00 20 00 and 30 00 ma cm2 following the graphs in figs 4 and 5 it can be seen that a current density of 20 00 ma cm2 is an overall reasonable setting for best performance therefore in fact the experiments in subsection 3 1 were carried out with that current density value although the higher current density of 30 00 ma cm2 also provides plausible treatment performance the corresponding energy consumption jumps to 12 5 kwh m3 from 8 kwh m3 for 20 ma cm2 in electrocoagulation and to 14 56 kwh m3 from 6 92 kwh m3 for 20 ma cm2 in electro fenton which causes the favoring for the electrical current density of 20 00 ma cm2 the energy consumption for these experiments depends on the instantaneous resistance of the aqueous solution as 9 e i r 2 t therefore although the current value can be fixed the conductance or conversely the resistance is a parameter dependent on contamination and it also varies during treatment eventually it is difficult to estimate the consumed energy value instead we have monitored the consumption through both voltage and current recordings during our experiments for analysis purposes as discussed in sec 3 1 the final energy consumption levels are around 7 14 kwh m3 which are comparable or less than the reported electric energy consumption reports throughout the literature 1 12 15 23 particularly wastewaters with organic contamination such as food industry and agriculture and wastewaters of oil and dye producers require up to ten folds of the energy consumption levels reported here 4 energy consumption equivalent oxygen demand for consumed energy although most of the electrochemical treatment reports mention about the consumed energy and even its economic fiscal value 40 42 at the end of the process the oxygen demand equivalent approach to the consumed energy is a novel contribution of this work since the proposed scheme uses electricity for the treatment of wastewater a proportional amount of co2 is emitted to the atmosphere for each kwh energy used proportionally a fraction of oxygen is consumed from the atmosphere it is therefore necessary to monitor how much energy is consumed for each unit of cod reduction and simultaneously convert the energy to an oxygen equivalent for example if the process requires m kwh for elimination of 1 kg of cod and if the utilized electricity causes an oxygen consumption of n kg per generated kwh then logic requires that n m must be less than 1 kg of oxygen for a reasonable attempt to treatment otherwise it would mean that for each reduced cod at the treatment site even more oxygen is demanded at the energy generation side rendering the process questionable in order to make this analysis the oxygen consumption n per produced kwh must be estimated according to a recent electrical energy source distribution study 32 the power sources can be visualized as in fig 6 once the contribution from coal and natural gas are considered the equivalent co2 emission per kwh can be obtained as 0 534 kg as a comparison the same co2 emission in usa is around 0 600 kg according to eia reports using the molecular mass formula it can be easily seen that 32 44 of the co2 mass corresponds to oxygen by calculation 10 n 0 534 32 44 0 388 kg kwh 388g kwh of oxygen in mass per consumed energy for the treatment in turkey this rate can be compared with the values of energy consumption that we have obtained in our experiments depending on the fenton coagulation process ph values and applied current densities the required energy for eliminating 90 of 1 g l cod was measured between 4 and 14 kwh m3 these numbers can be balanced in the common denominator as 0 004 0 014 kwh l or 0 0044 0 0155 kwh g cod multiplying these kwh rates with the oxygen equivalent for production n we get 388 0 0044 1 72 388 0 0155 6 35 both of these values are larger than 1 meaning that the overall process requires more than 1 g of oxygen to reduce 1 g of cod the above observation provides a novel insight to the phenomenon of energy consumption during electrochemical treatment if the cod decrease is considered as the treatment issue the process must consider simultaneous oxygen bonding during electricity generation as a second novel contribution of this work it is proposed that one does not need to consider the consumption only at the end of the process in fact the cod and energy consumption levels must be continuously monitored and one should not let the process to go beyond a certain duration of treatment the critical time threshold for treatment is when the amount of oxygen bonding for electric consumption overshoots the marginal decrease in oxygen demand in the treated wastewater the concept is described as an illustration in fig 7 the proposed model shows that the cod levels must be plotted as a function of used kwh where a linear oxygen consumption effect may be simply added to the oxygen function to find an optimal point in terms of oxygen demand for example in fig 7 the bonded oxygen in mass linearly increases as a function of produced energy at a rate of 0 534 32 44 0 388 kg kwh in mass per consumed energy practically the slope of this red line is fairly steep and there is a huge necessity of very quick and efficient electrochemical treatment systems if more renewable energy is produced in a country or if the proposed electrochemical treatment plant is located near to a renewable energy generator the rate slope of this red line could be smaller or even zero in this work we made the assumption that the treatment plant uses electricity that is plugged directly to the mains of a grid connected building in turkey obviously cod is not the only contamination parameter for treatment applications for example in tannery wastewaters chromium is a highly toxic and commonly encountered chemical that requires careful treatment but figs 2 4 and fig 5 a shows that the chromium elimination is quickly saturated at around 10 min if the processes were terminated at 10 min very reasonable chromium removals would be obtained while the cod reduction per l would be 400 mg with an oxygen demand cost at electric production side as low as 1 72 6 286 mg making the system an overall efficient one in order to better visualize the reasonable operation range cod removal performances of electrocoagulation and electro fenton treatment per utilized electric energy are shown in fig 8a and b for various current density settings the electricity production oxygen demand lines per utilized kwh are overlaid red lines on the graphs with a slope of 388 mg kwh l in fig 8a the electrocoagulation reactor treatment characteristic shows that although time wise performance at 10 00 ma cm2 current density stays small its performance per consumed energy hence per consumed oxygen is more efficient as compared to higher currents the lower going blue curve in fact despite their quick treatments higher current values seem to be more inefficient than low current densities in terms of per energy treatment the graphs show that spending energies over 1 2 kwh m3 is technically inefficient for cod reduction interestingly the energy efficiency property of low current densities is not the case in electro fenton the lowest going hence the most energy efficient treatment appears to be at 20 00 ma cm2 electric current density again the applicable energy consumption range is not over 1 2 kwh m3 the difference between these two behaviours imply that special care must be given to each proposed electrochemical treatment method by experimenting according to energy consumption for comparison the reported energy consumptions in 1 12 15 23 are all beyond the efficient consumption limit causing more oxygen to be consumed for electric production during reduction of cod these operating curves may be expected to differ further for various electrode types such as bdd ti irox etc consequently conduction of test experiments is recommended to observe these behaviours prior to installing actual treatment plants 5 conclusions and discussions in this work we have presented a case study of tannery wastewater treatment in order to illustrate the energy issues in electrochemical treatment since the eventual aim of wastewater treatment is to attain a clean and sustainable environment special interest must be paid to utilization electrical energy for the process it must be noted that an important portion of classical electricity power plants use fossil fuels for generating electricity whenever we plug our reactors to the mains of a building we cause a certain amount of co2 emission therefore it is not only an economical issue to spend energy in previous studies the economical aspects of spending certain energies and certain materials were carefully investigated 40 42 however a compatible oxygen demand equation is proposed for the first time in this work where the reduction in cod at the treatment site is compared to the amount of oxygen necessary to produce the electrical energy at the power generation side if this new aspect is kept in mind an environmentally friendly treatment plant must also consider energy efficiency of the process through an explicit oxygen balance equation this balance has two perspectives how much oxygen demand are we causing while trying to reduce the chemical oxygen demand of the wastewater at which energy consumption level do we need to stop and what are the optimal electrochemical reactor settings electrode selection ph current density etc for best treatment per consumed energy not necessarily treatment speed the answer to the first perspective i was sought after using an equivalent oxygen bonding amount to compensate the cod reduction at the wastewater treatment side a novel operation curve fig 7 is proposed to illustrate the linear increase of oxygen bonding as a function of utilized energy over where cod reduction can be plotted as in fig 8 the addition of oxygen curves produces a first decreasing then increasing pattern it is explained that the sign change in the slope is the point where the cod removal treatment must logically stop experimental results show that treatment for over 10 20 min already overshoots the efficient point for cod reduction so the process must be terminated at about 15 min fortunately the chromium removal already reaches to a saturation at these process times as a comparison the whole electrochemical treatment experimental results that are reported in the literature and mentioned in the introduction wildly overshoots the critical efficiency point of oxygen demand i e the sweet spot unfortunately since these papers only report the electrical energy consumption and do not provide an equivalent oxygen demand it had been difficult to come up with this observation this shows that the described efficiency analysis must be applied to other treatment applications too obviously the treatment of heavy metals is a very different issue their removal is separately critical as compared to simple cod removal in such cases it must be emphasized that the carbon emission of the electricity generation may not be as impactful or important as the elimination of such poisonous metals therefore the process must of course continue as long as necessary for the elimination of heavy metals down the regulation limits as a final remark regarding the perspective i the proposed analysis is valid only for an average electricity production profile of the country if the treatment plant installs a self sufficient renewable energy generation system consisting of solar pv panels and or wind turbines at a meteorologically suitable geographical location then the oxygen cost for producing each kwh energy would be practically zero in that case the above analysis would be unnecessary and the system could continue electrochemical treatment as long as desired the answer to the second perspective ii is easily attained through simple experiments that show treatment per kwh i e fig 7 interestingly we were unable to observe a consistent rule about parameter settings in electrochemical treatment similar situations are observed in different treatment applications in the literature in the aluminum electrode electrocoagulation case lower electric current density values seem to perform with higher energy efficiency fig 8a whereas that observation was not valid in electro fenton with iron electrodes fig 8b a similarly mixed set of results were available about the efficiency of the reactors under different ph conditions eventually we conclude that a thorough set of experiments is necessary for checking and observing combinations of parameters at different values for example testing at ph 3 5 7 etc and at each ph testing with a current density of 10 20 30 etc ma cm2 because different electrodes and different wastewater structures may not have a common parametric behavior testing these observations with different electrodes i e bdd ti irox etc different reactor styles i e raschig rings continuous process half cells etc and different wastewater cases i e agricultural urban etc may be listed as possible future study directions of this research acknowledgments this work has been supported in parts by the scientific and

14381,this paper presents data obtained through trials on small scale aquaponics sub system which performs the roles of biological and mechanical filters for aquaculture water quality remediation aquaponics is a bio integrated food production system consisting of closed recirculating aquaculture combined with hydroponics the trials were conducted on nile tilapia oreochromis niloticus and green beans phaseolus vulgaris and the chinese cabbage brassica rapa chinensis over a period of 70 days the results revealed that the system is more efficient in terms of plant growth and does not adversely affect the growth of captive stock of fish mean s d values of water temperature do ph nh3 n no2 n no3 n and po4 p during the trial were 25 2 0 25 c 6 6 0 13 mg l 7 14 0 06 0 23 0 02 mg l 0 39 0 22 mg

tilapia in converting feed mass a universally standard measure of efficiency of feed assimilation into weight gain especially when there is no additional source of nourishment high survival rate 95 2 8 was noticed during the trials the average sd values of biomass gain by p vulgaris and b rapa were 951 6 1 6 g and 85 3 13 4 g respectively the system was cost effective and efficient in purging the toxic waste from water resulting in remediation of water quality for the recirculating aquaculture system this reflected the effectiveness of biofiltration which is currently assessed by its ability to completely remove the ammonia and minimize the generation of nitrite keywords aquaculture aquaponic systems biological filter mechanical filter and media filled system 1 introduction conserving precious water resources is absolutely essential to protect environment during this period of climate change aquaculture uses a large volume of water and often the discharge contains substances that adversely affect the environment there has been a growing concern over the negative impact of aquaculture particularly the nutrient rich waste discharge from fish holding facilities which is known to can cause eutrophication and environmental deterioration 1 9 aquaculture is a broad subject covering cultivation and harvest of commercially important aquatic plants and animals mostly in a controlled environment the combination of aquaculture and hydroponics is known as aquaponics which is emerging as an important topic in many countries combination of aquaculture and hydroponics has been studied by researchers worldwide for the last three decades with manipulation of the models of aquaponic systems together with a variety of plants especially vegetables and aquatic animals 7 8 10 13 aquaponic is a bio integrated system that links closed recirculating aquaculture with hydroponics growing plants especially vegetables in a soilless condition reusing nutrient rich water from the captive animal stocks in tanks for absorption by plants after the conversion of toxic substances to harmless elements by the nitrifying bacteria the harmless nutrients act as natural fertilizers and ensure the growth of the plants 10 13 aquaponics can be applied both on freshwater and seawater aquatic species depending on their compatibility for example freshwater species such as tilapia and african catfish can be cultured together with fruiting vegetables such as tomatoes cucumber green beans and leafy vegetables such as green mustards cabbage kale while seawater species like groupers can be grown together with seaweeds 8 10 12 14 18 integrated aquaculture is now accepted as an alternative to conventional practice of farming as the system is known to decrease the expenses involved in operations including labour cost irrigation cost land revenue and management as well as the option of culturing two sources of food aquatic animals and plants rather than fish alone 5 8 13 integrated aquaculture can be operated at a comparatively lower cost in terms water use space and management furthermore the aquaponic system produces multiple sources of food of plant and animal origin that enhance the output without the need for running separate culture systems for the various species from an environmental perspective aquaponic stands out as a resource efficient system of food production that minimizes the externalities and allows cascading of nutrients that otherwise would cause eutrophication problem in the surrounding 1 3 4 because aquaponics does not involve the use of antibiotics and other harmful materials the plants and animals so produced can carry the label of blue green products in the niche market food cultivated hydroponically can be classified as green products as it is free from the use of chemical fertilizers antibiotics pesticide or herbicide as for the aquaponics it yields organic products and the its wastewater is used without creating problems such as water pollution eutrophication and blooming of harmful algae because of the abundance of nutrients 1 18 those problems do not only affect water quality but the food chain in the aquatic ecosystems is also impacted 2 7 9 therefore this study was conducted to evaluate the performance of nile tilapia oreochromis niloticus and cultivated vegetables green beans phaseolus vulgaris and chinese white cabbage brassica rapa chinensis the changes in water quality in situ and ex situ parameters in three aquaponic sub systems namely media filled system mfs deep water raft system dwrs and nutrient film system nft were investigated the findings of this study will help farmers make choices in applying aquaponic sub systems suitability these systems represent the best available option for low carbon method of organic aquaculture this work is an attempt to bridge the most glaring knowledge gaps pertaining to relative biomass of stocked species regarding their compatibility in an integrated biodynamic system in this context the most glaring knowledge gaps pertain to the relative biomass of stocked species of the aquaponics system paucity of scientific data on this aspect is constraining the growth and diversification of low carbon methods of aquaculture a topic that deserves priority for generation of data is regarding the nutrient turnover in different aquaponic modules since nutrient availability in the system is a function of fed species production and uptake of nutrients in their waste by extractives this will provide a basis for supplementing nutrients when necessary to support growth of all the species or to control levels of substances originating from fed and extractive species in excess of requirements the nutrient data for different integrated systems is largely non comparable because the nutrients in the systems are in different forms indicating the need to address the paucity of information by targeted studies 19 2 materials and methods 2 1 aquaponic systems description this study was conducted at borneo marine research institute of universiti malaysia sabah in the designated aquaponic research area fig 1 the experimental site was covered with a transparent roof and a layer of 50 penetrating sunlight shading net beneath it the area was provided with electricity and water supplies a total of 12 sub systems of the aquaponic units fig 2 were set up consisting of triplicate sets of four treatments mfs dwrs nft and control each of these sub systems consisted of a series of tanks including fish tank 250 l filter tank 50 l and plant tank each of these tanks was of 50 l capacity and contained 350 l of water at all times to operate the system the four different treatments tested in this study were 1 control treatment with no vegetables in the hydroponic sub system where the water was continuously flowing into each of the hydroponic tanks without the presence of media 2 mfs was filled with washed gravel fig 2a 3 dwrs contained plants placed on the floating raft styrofoam in such a way that their roots were completely immersed in the water fig 2a and 4 nft where the plants were put in a narrow pvc pipe and the roots were partially immersed into the water fig 2b all these treatments were arranged in a randomized block experimental design operational similarities that were maintained in the triplicate sets in terms of tank features size colour installation in close proximity to minimize positional variations in light exposure and water supply same source quality and quantity ensured the reliability of the average values a submersible water pump 15 w was installed in fish tanks in each of these aquaponic sub systems the water pump was able to lift water up to 1 5 m upwards another pvc pipe of 15 mm diameter and 28 cm length was connected to the pump so that the water could flow into the pvc pipe and fill the filter tank two types of filtration processes that occurred within the systems were mechanical and biological filtration mechanical filter was in the form of sponge pads that acted to remove undesirable particles and solid waste from fish excrement uneaten feed particles sludge or dust gravel served as the substrate for biological filters nitrifying bacteria nitrifying bacteria that settle and grow on the gravel convert toxic nitrogenous waste especially ammonia to nitrite and nitrite to nitrate to non toxic levels generally in aquaponics the nitrifying bacteria are presumed to be present not requiring examination unless a microbiological study is planned their presence in water supplies established by several authors earlier for example 20 does not suggest specialized investigations for detection it is accepted as an established fact this approach of study is consistent with the objective of the trials requiring analysis of water quality dynamics as indicative of nitrifying activity of the bacteria filter tank was put at the highest point of the system and after the water started flowing through these two types of filtration facilities a 3 cm draining outlet allowed the water to flow down to the plant tank under gravity for aquaponic sub systems of mfs dwrs and control treatment four small plant tanks made up of plastic material were arranged to have two stages of plant tank fig 2 first stage was vertically oriented so that the water could flow to the second stage of plant tank that was oriented horizontally the part of the plant tank was arranged facing the fish tank so that the overflowing water could return back to the fish tank and the water movements continued to provide dissolved oxygen to the aquatic animals bacteria and vegetables 2 2 experimental methodology all the sub systems were refilled with fresh water for washing and were soaked for at least 5 days to initiate growth of bacteria in the water and media in each of the systems before the experiment started this procedure followed the standard practice in this and many other aquaculture facilities for conditioning of the rearing system that facilitates the establishment of nitrification process after a week the water in the systems was replaced and the fish were transferred to the fish tank a weekly water replacement was considered necessary in the recirculation system to control nitrate levels specimens of nile tilapia oreochromis niloticus weighing 3 05 0 37 g to 7 1 0 25 g and measuring approximately 5 7 cm in length were used for the experiment stocking density of the fish was 30 tails per m2 p vulgaris and b rapa were transferred to the hydroponic sub systems after one week of germination the individual weight height of plants and width of leaves were recorded sixteen plantlets of each of these vegetables were put into the individual units of aquaponic systems except for the control treatment aeration was provided by water movement especially during overflow from one to another tank there was no water renewal except compensation of the volume lost to evaporation and this amounted to 10 per week fish were fed twice per day in the morning 0900 and evening 1600 using commercial extruded tilapia feed sinking pellets containing 32 of crude protein 5 crude fat and 12 moisture feeding rate was 4 of total body weight until satiation the feed was produced by the company desa cargill sdn bhd this ration size was based on preliminary observations to avoid any surplus quantity exceeding the appetite level for cost saving as well as preventing the deterioration of water quality mortality if any was recorded on a daily basis bottom cleaning was done once per two days by way of cleaning the tank bottom so that solid residue could be removed from the fish tank the solid wastes that accumulated at the bottom of the tank comprised the particles of uneaten feed waste from the fish and some dead algae the water flow was set at the rate of 1 6 l min as suggested by endut et al 21 who emphasized that this water flow rate was efficient enough for such aquaponic systems the flow rate were adjustable manually at the outlet from the water pump using 25 mm socket valves and was recorded using a measuring cylinder and stopwatch besides the cost of production in each of the aquaponic sub systems was evaluated for determining the economic feasibility of producing animal and plant for human consumption 2 3 monitoring and data collection monitoring and data collection started one week after the plant and fish were acclimatized to the system and the bio film was established the biofilm is in the form of bacterial microorganisms that stick together and appear as a layer on the surface of the objects used for the purpose it generally happens in fish culture tanks but was not subject of microbiological analysis in this study observations on fish and plant were made every 10 days over a period of 70 days to assess their growth performance this duration of experimental trial in this study is a reasonable timeframe to establish the performance of aquaponic modules as suggested by sumbing et al 22 2 4 growth performance of tilapia observations were made on body weight gain g specific growth rate sgr survival rate of fish dry feed intake g and feed conversion ratio which are the standard parameters in growth studies 10 21 22 following formulae were used for these measurements 1 survival rate no of fish at the end of experiment 100 no of

the plants to the aquaponic sub systems after three days the radicle of b rapa was seen breaking through the seed coat and projecting out during the germination period both the plant seedlings were seen growing normally attaining similar height that was measured they were deep green with a healthy look at the end of germination period the green bean seedlings were measured 6 7 cm while b rapa was slightly shorter in height measuring 3 4 cm the seeds of p vulgaris grew faster and were distinctly taller than the seeds of b rapa they were transferred to the hydroponic sub systems after one week of germination the individual weight height of plants and width of leaves were recorded during the experiment that involved 16 plantlets of each vegetable in the individual units of the aquaponic system except for the control treatment this allowed a fairly accurate assessment of growth besides other parameters observed for the data analyses were length of roots cm length of leaves cm average total yield g average pod yield g for green beans number of pods produced and average total length of pods cm only for the green beans 2 6 physico chemical parameters of water dissolved oxygen do ph and temperature were measured using hanna instrument twice daily during the experimental period these parameters are important in assessing the condition of the rearing medium for growth of fish and plants and to ensure that the variations were within the optimum range 2 7 water nutrient concentration triplicate water samples from each of the treatment sets were transferred to 500 ml polyethylene bottle to test ammonia nitrogen nh3 n nitrite nitrogen no2 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n and phosphate po4 p as suggested by wetzel and likens 23 this analysis was performed once per 10 days all samples were filtered with a whatman filter paper of a pore size of 0 45 μm before laboratory analyses absorbance of each water sample was recorded using unico 2100 spectrophotometer these techniques are widely used due to convenience and accuracy in analysis of water in tropical as well as temperate regions 2 8 statistical analysis data pertaining to fish production and plant growth performance as well as water quality analysis were processed using microsoft excel 2010 and spss 18 0 statistical package for social sciences values were expressed as mean standard error one way anova analyses were used to test the significance p 0 05 of differences between the treatments based on the mean values of the data collected for growth performance and survival rate of fish plants as well as water quality parameters in situ and ex situ when the differences were significant at 0 05 levels the values were compared using the shapiro wilk test followed by the homogeneity test and finally tukey hsd test to further evaluate the statistical differences among the treatments 3 results and discussion 3 1 fish production table 1 shows the growth performance indicators comprising body weight gain bwg specific growth rate sgr survival rate sr feed conversion ratio fcr and total weight gain twg of the fish in the four treatments control mfs dwrs and nfs the data reveals that the weight gained by o niloticus was in the range of 33 5 0 56 g to 35 7 0 62 g the specific growth rate was 2 5 0 04 to 2 7 0 04 g day the highest survival rate varied from 93 3 4 4 to 98 3 1 6 these growth and survival values further demonstrated the remarkable adaptability and resilience of nile tilapia and suitability of this fish for aquaponic systems feed conversion ratio varied from 1 29 0 06 to 1 48 0 08 indicating high efficiency of nile tilapia in converting feed into flesh the total weight gain ranged from 630 4 3 76 g to 637 17 8 49 g the initial mean body weight bw of nile tilapia was almost the same implying lack of significant differences p 0 05 among the treatment groups the data on growth and food assimilation leaves no doubt that the environmental conditions in captivity are suitable for the fish results of this study are supported by previous studies done by al hafedh et al 14 who noticed that the survival of tilapia was more than 95 under basically similar handling conditions in the aquaponic farming however in some trials the survival of tilapia was only 78 16 likewise sgr for this species is higher in the present investigation than that reported by salam et al 9 indicating that the culture conditions were better in the aquaponic system designed for this study fcr value was similar to that reported by salama et al 24 and al hafedh et al 14 and the plausible explanation is that the aquaponic system did not significantly influence the fcr results showed no significant differences p 0 05 in wg sgr dfi twg sr in o niloticus among the four different aquaponic systems including the control set this finding suggests that performance of the systems was comparable in terms of supporting the biomass gain in the fish concordant views have been published earlier 21 12 17 10 these similarities could be linked to supply of the same types of feed starter pellet for tilapia and the ability of tilapia to make best use of nutrients reflecting the remarkable tolerance of the fish to variable culture systems the observations support the widely held view about resilience and adaptability of tilapia however the data obtained in this investigation shows that there are challenges that deserve attention because aquaponics is a relatively new research interest resilience of this fish to different factors operating in a captive environment with multiple species playing their roles has to be considered to successfully sustain the culture system through the entire production cycle 3 2 plants vegetables growth performance as the experiment was ongoing the green beans grew rapidly along the pole installed to facilitate their growth they produced twisted vine growth of b rapa was comparatively slower with distinct signs of nutrient deficiency there were indications that the plants were competing for nutrients unlike the green beans that seemed to be able to draw adequate amounts of the required nutrients number of pods produced by green beans their average length and biomass gain pointed to their positive growth performance these data on green beans and growth parameters related to chinese white cabbage average length of roots are presented in table 2 the highest average biomass gain of p vulgaris was dominated by mfs followed by dwrs and the lowest was nfs table 2 the efficiency of the system in producing green beans was as follows mfs dwrs nfs fig 3 approximately 1 kg of green beans can be produced by mfs 951 6 1 64 g and dwrs 943 3 14 4 g while the nfs yielded less than a half 380 2 97 5 g of the amount of green beans produced by mfs and dwrs fig 4 these observations are supported by the data on total number of pods produced in the three different aquaponic systems the highest total number of pods was recorded in mfs followed by dwrs and nfs most number of pods produced contributed to higher biomass gain by mfs the average number of pods produced was observed in the mfs 166 67 9 7 followed by dwrs 133 38 5 5 and nft 70 0 19 34 there were significant differences p 0 05 among the mfs dwrs and nft treatments table 2 total length of pods in nft was highest 13 26 0 27 cm followed by dwrs 12 44 0 25 cm and mfs 13 03 0 14 cm there was no significant difference p 0 05 in the total length of the pods among the treatments the differences in aquaponic systems in the recirculating aquaculture did not affect the length of the pods table 2 the results showed that the quality of green beans produced in each system was the same obviously because the source of nutrients for plants to produce pods was similar and all treatments involved extracting nutrients from the effluents originating from nile tilapia as far as b rapa is concerned only 85 3 13 4 g was produced in mfs while in dwrs and nft the values were lower 60 2 2 6 g and 54 5 10 6 g respectively table 2 study done by sace and fitzsimmons 17 reported that average yield of chinese white cabbage in aquaponic systems was 169 9 g it shows that chinese white cabbage did not achieve marketable size in this study fig 5 this is because of high competition of nutrients and space for the roots of p vulgaris and b rapa in addition the differences in physical appearance of b rapa produced from aquaponics and conventional methods of soil based cultivation were observed fig 6 less biomass gain was noted in b rapa from the aquaponic as is evident from smaller white stalk fig 6a compared to those grown in soil fig 6b however leaves showed holes that are known as shotholes and necrotic spot on the upper surface this affects the weight and sizes of the vegetable the lower biomass weight in chinese white cabbage may be related to a number of reasons including suitability of the plant for certain types of aquaponic systems the concentration of nitrate and phosphate in the water or the growth period 25 because it grew in combination with p vulgaris the plant could have suffered from competition for nutrients space and sunlight it can be seen that green beans cling and climb upwards towards the sunlight and this prevents direct sunlight on b rapa in the plant grow bed area moreover the plants did show visual nitrogen deficiency symptoms 26 27 towards the end of harvesting period as reflected by yellowing of older leaves and thin stems compared to b rapa cultivated in soils the leaves were visibly less dense in colour and stunted on the other hand despite lower biomass gain in b rapa noticed in this research a comparison has been made between the physical appearance of b rapa from aquaponic and conventional methods soil b rapa grown in soils have many small holes in leaves that give the foliage a characteristic shothole appearance possibly caused by insects this reveals the vulnerability of the plant raised in soil to insect pests especially flea beetle the symptoms were in the form of irregular yellow patches on leaves that seemed to turn yellowish brown in colour and possessed growth on both of their sides possibly caused by fungus from the soil such symptoms were absent from the plant grown in the aquaponic system thus the chances of such diseases can be greatly reduced by cultivating the vegetables in the aquaponic systems even though the biomass gain is lower than the commercial weight reported but it will be possible to stimulate growth through follow up investigations on the efficiency of aquaponic systems this will also enhance the economic viability of the aquaponic growing system by multiple cropping better market value and reducing loss due to diseases the longest roots observed in p vulgaris was in mfs 77 7 3 56 cm followed by dwrs 65 95 4 47 cm and nft 60 07 3 06 cm while in the case of b rapa the data obtained were mfs 23 07 3 56 cm nft 21 53 3 06 cm dwrs 22 0 1 6 cm table 2 the length of the roots showed no significant difference p 0 05 between the three treatments the total length of roots in the two vegetables is shown in fig 7 it is evident that the roots of p vulgaris were much longer than those of b rapa longer roots provided greater surface area for attachment of microbial organisms that help in breakdown of many types of compounds including conversion of ammonia to nitrite and nitrite to nitrate 7 12 13 18 plants with larger root surface area have unique advantage in aquaponic systems since different plants have different growth characteristics and nitrogen utilization capacity 28 13 besides as stated earlier important factors regulating plant nutrient uptake include nutrient availability stage of growth growth rate root zone temperature as well as different types of plant roots 29 these factors can act collectively to influence growth of the plant and its health and resilience substrate in the form of gravel and submerged plant roots in mfs provide surface area for attachment of bacteria that help in conversion of toxic chemicals into non toxic substances improving water quality and absorption of nutrients through the plant roots 7 13 plant roots in dwrs are also fully submerged in the water and facilitate the beneficial bacterial activity as explained above for mfs system 15 concordant views have been published by shete et al 30 who emphasized that the flooded hydroponic systems provide maximum surface area and sufficient time for nutrient utilization by the plants while in nfs a thin film of water is available in the hydroponics tank pvc the plant roots are only partially submerged in water according to herbert and herbert 15 even though the plant roots are only partially submerged in the water the portion exposed to air helps in oxygen uptake even though it reduces area for attachment of bacteria and limits the absorption of inorganic nutrients besides providing anchorage and support it can be said that mfs and dwrs are more efficient in terms of plant or fruit biomass production than nfs 3 3 water quality parameters average values of temperature c dissolved oxygen do mg l and ph in the three different aquaponic systems are shown in table 3 the data reveals that the mean s e of temperature ranged from 25 26 0 25 c to 25 92 0 4 c do varied from 6 48 0 15 mg l to 6 77 0 15 mg l and ph was in the range of 6 96 0 07 to 7 16 0 07 statistically there was no significant difference p 0 05 between these four aquaponic sub systems and the control set in temperature c dissolved oxygen do and ph based on these observations and recorded data values of temperature do level and temperature in each aquaponic system fall within the favourable range required for tilapia 24 moreover value of ph during the experiments was within the optimum range since conversion of ammonia to nitrite is effective between 5 8 mg l to 8 5 mg l it is worth noticing that the empirical data emphasized the importance of integrating plant crops for mitigating the toxic effects of ammonia in cultured stocks 12 10 several water quality factors need to be considered throughout the experiment to observe the effect of differences in water quality in the three different aquaponic systems especially vis a vis temperature c dissolved oxygen mg l and ph as well as the concentration of total nitrogen ammonia nitrite and nitrate within the aquaponic systems the overall goal of water quality evaluation should be recognized as an essential element for maintaining a healthy ecosystem that supports a healthy farming system for aquatic animals fish plants and beneficial bacteria 27 nitrification is affected by the environmental factors such as ph temperature presence of organic matter and substrates used as well as concentrations of o2 nh3 and no2 in the experimental trials conducted by salama et al 24 and daudpota et al 31 the water quality was within the acceptable range for tilapia culture with temperature varying from 22 c to 30 c in the present study the temperature varied from 25 26 c to 25 92 c salama et al 24 reported optimal temperature for growth of tilapia was 25 c to 28 c in aquaponic system designed for this research the temperature range appeared suitable for growth of nile tilapia the concentration of do recorded was above the values reported by daudpota et al 31 showing that the results obtained in this study were better for tilapia growth in addition to production from the hydroponic arrangement the system also releases oxygen to the atmosphere through the root systems 15 besides high concentration of dissolved oxygen in the root zone is one of the factors that could contribute to increase in fresh mass of plants the ph ranged between 6 96 0 07 to 7 16 0 07 throughout the experiment and this was within the acceptable range for fish culture as well as cultivation of plants as stated by ho 26 while the normal range of ph in the hydroponic cultivation is generally between 5 7 5 but even 5 5 6 5 has given good results generally farmers maintain a ph 6 5 9 but prefer slightly alkaline medium in this range all mentioned parameters were within the optimal range for culturing nile tilapia 14 16 research on integrating nile tilapia together with water spinach ipomoea aquatic as carried out by danaher et al 16 indicated no significant difference p 0 05 between water quality parameters observed temperature dissolved oxygen and ph 3 4 water nutrients concentrations the water nutrient concentrations of nh3 n no2n no3 n and po4 p in the three aquaponic systems varied as shown in table 4 nutrient concentrations of nh3n no2 n no3 n and po4 p in each system mfs dwrs and nft decreased with the duration of culture except for the control treatment fig 8 as supported by shete et al 30 where the value of overall nitrogen reduction in the aquaponic system showed better results than control treatment without aquaponic system no significant differences p 0 05 were detected in the dynamics of nh3 n and no2 n unlike significant differences p 0 05 in the concentrations of no3 n and po4 p among the four systems including the control treatment the average of highest levels of accumulated nh3 n no2 n no3 n and po4 p in the three aquaponic systems including the control system were 0 29 0 11 g l 0 61 0 19 mg l 1 17 0 32 mg l and 0 57 0 2 mg l respectively these values were well within the range of optimal requirements for tilapia culture 32 the decline of nutrient concentrations within the aquaponic systems was due to their utilization by plants and bacteria the concentration of nh3 n in the four aquaponic systems including the control treatment was high in the beginning of the experiment and maintained a decreasing trend in the first 20 days this can be explained by the slow growth of the nitrifying bacteria 5 13 18 probably there were not enough nitrifying bacteria to carry out the nitrification process efficiently 28 at this early stage nitrifying bacteria would multiply and the accumulation of nh3 n is caused by the presence of nitrogen in the aquaponic system introduced by waste from the fish as well as nutrient leaching from the feed occurrence of nh3 n in the water column could trigger the ammonia oxidizing bacteria to turn it into no2 n while the nitrite oxidizing bacteria especially nicrobacter spp and nitrospira spp degrade it to nitrate 28 10 low nitrogen concentration in the water column may be due to removal of most of the ammonia nitrite and nitrate by an active microbial population and this enabled the roots of the plant to grow rapidly and absorb the nutrients 2 no2 n is a transition ion during the nitrification process and exhibits lower toxicity than nh3 n the concentration of no2 n was maintained below 2 mg l and it decreased throughout the experiment because of the abundance of ammonia oxidizing bacteria responsible for the rate limiting step of nitrification 33 while the concentration of no3 n steadily decreased with a steady fall between 10 30 days a rapid development of plant roots that occurred could have been a contributory factor in combating the accumulation of no3 n in the aquaponic systems the concentration of no3 n in the control treatment changed little because of the absence of plants and was possibly caused by the denitrification process that occurred in the system the decreasing values of nh3 n no2 n and no3 n supported that the plants to use surface area of roots for efficient nutrient utilization 30 the concentration of po4 p in the four treatments showed a declining trend during the 70 days of the experiment in the present study the main source of phosphorus in the aquaculture system was artificial feed only a minor percentage of phosphorus is available for incorporation into fish biomass 32 removal of phosphate that seemed to have started from the early stages indicated that the phosphorus is needed continuously for root development which occurred at greater rate initially 29 lin et al 2 suggested that removal of phosphate in the aquaponic system is caused by uptake by the plants as well as its deposition in the gravel 3 5 economic feasibility of small scale aquaponic sub systems economic feasibility needed to be evaluated to determine the benefits of the aquaponic systems developed in this study and to compare their importance vis a vis other ways of farming of fish and vegetables the lowest cost of production of 1m2 aquaponic systems was only usd 43 39 for mfs followed by dwrs usd 48 10 and nfs amounting to usd 56 64 data presented in table 5 provides the profitability of applying the aquaponics technique for aquatic farming at a commercial scale it is evident from the data that the production of aquaculture earned usd28 80 as profit as compared usd 38 88 from hydroponics and usd 67 76 through aquaponic system the value is only for 1m2 and this was double from that of the aquaculture and hydroponic systems besides the lowest cost of production of aquaponic system is seen from mfs that offered the most efficient production compared to dwrs and nfs after 6 months the profit gained using the mfs was almost twice generating approximately usd 24 28 for 1 m2 4 conclusion this study indicates that the three developed aquaponic sub systems mfs dwrs and nfs did not significantly influence the growth performance of nile tilapia oreochromis niloticus in terms of weight gain specific growth rate feed conversion ratio and survival rate the changes in water quality parameters revealed that the reduced nutrient levels were caused by the utilization and absorption by plants for their growth the developed aquaponic systems showed that these were not only suitable for an integrated system for biomass production of plants but also useful for reusing the nutrient rich water available in the aquaculture system the importance of this study is that it gives an overview to the beginners and also to the farmers intending to apply these three types of aquaponic systems in cultivating tilapia together with green beans and chinese white cabbage they all are suitable and can be adapted depending on the species combinations the production of fish and plant those crops can be estimated by referring to the data provided in this study it can be considered that aquaponic system is more profitable than fish production alone however more research must be done on these technique for better results acknowledgments special thanks to the ministry of education malaysia for providing financial support under

14381,this paper presents data obtained through trials on small scale aquaponics sub system which performs the roles of biological and mechanical filters for aquaculture water quality remediation aquaponics is a bio integrated food production system consisting of closed recirculating aquaculture combined with hydroponics the trials were conducted on nile tilapia oreochromis niloticus and green beans phaseolus vulgaris and the chinese cabbage brassica rapa chinensis over a period of 70 days the results revealed that the system is more efficient in terms of plant growth and does not adversely affect the growth of captive stock of fish mean s d values of water temperature do ph nh3 n no2 n no3 n and po4 p during the trial were 25 2 0 25 c 6 6 0 13 mg l 7 14 0 06 0 23 0 02 mg l 0 39 0 22 mg l 0 89 0 37 mg l and 0 45 0 04 mg l respectively the average total weight gain by o niloticus was 637 2 8 49 g and feed conversion ratio fcr was 1 47 0 01 which indicated the efficiency of nile tilapia in converting feed mass a universally standard measure of efficiency of feed assimilation into weight gain especially when there is no additional source of nourishment high survival rate 95 2 8 was noticed during the trials the average sd values of biomass gain by p vulgaris and b rapa were 951 6 1 6 g and 85 3 13 4 g respectively the system was cost effective and efficient in purging the toxic waste from water resulting in remediation of water quality for the recirculating aquaculture system this reflected the effectiveness of biofiltration which is currently assessed by its ability to completely remove the ammonia and minimize the generation of nitrite keywords aquaculture aquaponic systems biological filter mechanical filter and media filled system 1 introduction conserving precious water resources is absolutely essential to protect environment during this period of climate change aquaculture uses a large volume of water and often the discharge contains substances that adversely affect the environment there has been a growing concern over the negative impact of aquaculture particularly the nutrient rich waste discharge from fish holding facilities which is known to can cause eutrophication and environmental deterioration 1 9 aquaculture is a broad subject covering cultivation and harvest of commercially important aquatic plants and animals mostly in a controlled environment the combination of aquaculture and hydroponics is known as aquaponics which is emerging as an important topic in many countries combination of aquaculture and hydroponics has been studied by researchers worldwide for the last three decades with manipulation of the models of aquaponic systems together with a variety of plants especially vegetables and aquatic animals 7 8 10 13 aquaponic is a bio integrated system that links closed recirculating aquaculture with hydroponics growing plants especially vegetables in a soilless condition reusing nutrient rich water from the captive animal stocks in tanks for absorption by plants after the conversion of toxic substances to harmless elements by the nitrifying bacteria the harmless nutrients act as natural fertilizers and ensure the growth of the plants 10 13 aquaponics can be applied both on freshwater and seawater aquatic species depending on their compatibility for example freshwater species such as tilapia and african catfish can be cultured together with fruiting vegetables such as tomatoes cucumber green beans and leafy vegetables such as green mustards cabbage kale while seawater species like groupers can be grown together with seaweeds 8 10 12 14 18 integrated aquaculture is now accepted as an alternative to conventional practice of farming as the system is known to decrease the expenses involved in operations including labour cost irrigation cost land revenue and management as well as the option of culturing two sources of food aquatic animals and plants rather than fish alone 5 8 13 integrated aquaculture can be operated at a comparatively lower cost in terms water use space and management furthermore the aquaponic system produces multiple sources of food of plant and animal origin that enhance the output without the need for running separate culture systems for the various species from an environmental perspective aquaponic stands out as a resource efficient system of food production that minimizes the externalities and allows cascading of nutrients that otherwise would cause eutrophication problem in the surrounding 1 3 4 because aquaponics does not involve the use of antibiotics and other harmful materials the plants and animals so produced can carry the label of blue green products in the niche market food cultivated hydroponically can be classified as green products as it is free from the use of chemical fertilizers antibiotics pesticide or herbicide as for the aquaponics it yields organic products and the its wastewater is used without creating problems such as water pollution eutrophication and blooming of harmful algae because of the abundance of nutrients 1 18 those problems do not only affect water quality but the food chain in the aquatic ecosystems is also impacted 2 7 9 therefore this study was conducted to evaluate the performance of nile tilapia oreochromis niloticus and cultivated vegetables green beans phaseolus vulgaris and chinese white cabbage brassica rapa chinensis the changes in water quality in situ and ex situ parameters in three aquaponic sub systems namely media filled system mfs deep water raft system dwrs and nutrient film system nft were investigated the findings of this study will help farmers make choices in applying aquaponic sub systems suitability these systems represent the best available option for low carbon method of organic aquaculture this work is an attempt to bridge the most glaring knowledge gaps pertaining to relative biomass of stocked species regarding their compatibility in an integrated biodynamic system in this context the most glaring knowledge gaps pertain to the relative biomass of stocked species of the aquaponics system paucity of scientific data on this aspect is constraining the growth and diversification of low carbon methods of aquaculture a topic that deserves priority for generation of data is regarding the nutrient turnover in different aquaponic modules since nutrient availability in the system is a function of fed species production and uptake of nutrients in their waste by extractives this will provide a basis for supplementing nutrients when necessary to support growth of all the species or to control levels of substances originating from fed and extractive species in excess of requirements the nutrient data for different integrated systems is largely non comparable because the nutrients in the systems are in different forms indicating the need to address the paucity of information by targeted studies 19 2 materials and methods 2 1 aquaponic systems description this study was conducted at borneo marine research institute of universiti malaysia sabah in the designated aquaponic research area fig 1 the experimental site was covered with a transparent roof and a layer of 50 penetrating sunlight shading net beneath it the area was provided with electricity and water supplies a total of 12 sub systems of the aquaponic units fig 2 were set up consisting of triplicate sets of four treatments mfs dwrs nft and control each of these sub systems consisted of a series of tanks including fish tank 250 l filter tank 50 l and plant tank each of these tanks was of 50 l capacity and contained 350 l of water at all times to operate the system the four different treatments tested in this study were 1 control treatment with no vegetables in the hydroponic sub system where the water was continuously flowing into each of the hydroponic tanks without the presence of media 2 mfs was filled with washed gravel fig 2a 3 dwrs contained plants placed on the floating raft styrofoam in such a way that their roots were completely immersed in the water fig 2a and 4 nft where the plants were put in a narrow pvc pipe and the roots were partially immersed into the water fig 2b all these treatments were arranged in a randomized block experimental design operational similarities that were maintained in the triplicate sets in terms of tank features size colour installation in close proximity to minimize positional variations in light exposure and water supply same source quality and quantity ensured the reliability of the average values a submersible water pump 15 w was installed in fish tanks in each of these aquaponic sub systems the water pump was able to lift water up to 1 5 m upwards another pvc pipe of 15 mm diameter and 28 cm length was connected to the pump so that the water could flow into the pvc pipe and fill the filter tank two types of filtration processes that occurred within the systems were mechanical and biological filtration mechanical filter was in the form of sponge pads that acted to remove undesirable particles and solid waste from fish excrement uneaten feed particles sludge or dust gravel served as the substrate for biological filters nitrifying bacteria nitrifying bacteria that settle and grow on the gravel convert toxic nitrogenous waste especially ammonia to nitrite and nitrite to nitrate to non toxic levels generally in aquaponics the nitrifying bacteria are presumed to be present not requiring examination unless a microbiological study is planned their presence in water supplies established by several authors earlier for example 20 does not suggest specialized investigations for detection it is accepted as an established fact this approach of study is consistent with the objective of the trials requiring analysis of water quality dynamics as indicative of nitrifying activity of the bacteria filter tank was put at the highest point of the system and after the water started flowing through these two types of filtration facilities a 3 cm draining outlet allowed the water to flow down to the plant tank under gravity for aquaponic sub systems of mfs dwrs and control treatment four small plant tanks made up of plastic material were arranged to have two stages of plant tank fig 2 first stage was vertically oriented so that the water could flow to the second stage of plant tank that was oriented horizontally the part of the plant tank was arranged facing the fish tank so that the overflowing water could return back to the fish tank and the water movements continued to provide dissolved oxygen to the aquatic animals bacteria and vegetables 2 2 experimental methodology all the sub systems were refilled with fresh water for washing and were soaked for at least 5 days to initiate growth of bacteria in the water and media in each of the systems before the experiment started this procedure followed the standard practice in this and many other aquaculture facilities for conditioning of the rearing system that facilitates the establishment of nitrification process after a week the water in the systems was replaced and the fish were transferred to the fish tank a weekly water replacement was considered necessary in the recirculation system to control nitrate levels specimens of nile tilapia oreochromis niloticus weighing 3 05 0 37 g to 7 1 0 25 g and measuring approximately 5 7 cm in length were used for the experiment stocking density of the fish was 30 tails per m2 p vulgaris and b rapa were transferred to the hydroponic sub systems after one week of germination the individual weight height of plants and width of leaves were recorded sixteen plantlets of each of these vegetables were put into the individual units of aquaponic systems except for the control treatment aeration was provided by water movement especially during overflow from one to another tank there was no water renewal except compensation of the volume lost to evaporation and this amounted to 10 per week fish were fed twice per day in the morning 0900 and evening 1600 using commercial extruded tilapia feed sinking pellets containing 32 of crude protein 5 crude fat and 12 moisture feeding rate was 4 of total body weight until satiation the feed was produced by the company desa cargill sdn bhd this ration size was based on preliminary observations to avoid any surplus quantity exceeding the appetite level for cost saving as well as preventing the deterioration of water quality mortality if any was recorded on a daily basis bottom cleaning was done once per two days by way of cleaning the tank bottom so that solid residue could be removed from the fish tank the solid wastes that accumulated at the bottom of the tank comprised the particles of uneaten feed waste from the fish and some dead algae the water flow was set at the rate of 1 6 l min as suggested by endut et al 21 who emphasized that this water flow rate was efficient enough for such aquaponic systems the flow rate were adjustable manually at the outlet from the water pump using 25 mm socket valves and was recorded using a measuring cylinder and stopwatch besides the cost of production in each of the aquaponic sub systems was evaluated for determining the economic feasibility of producing animal and plant for human consumption 2 3 monitoring and data collection monitoring and data collection started one week after the plant and fish were acclimatized to the system and the bio film was established the biofilm is in the form of bacterial microorganisms that stick together and appear as a layer on the surface of the objects used for the purpose it generally happens in fish culture tanks but was not subject of microbiological analysis in this study observations on fish and plant were made every 10 days over a period of 70 days to assess their growth performance this duration of experimental trial in this study is a reasonable timeframe to establish the performance of aquaponic modules as suggested by sumbing et al 22 2 4 growth performance of tilapia observations were made on body weight gain g specific growth rate sgr survival rate of fish dry feed intake g and feed conversion ratio which are the standard parameters in growth studies 10 21 22 following formulae were used for these measurements 1 survival rate no of fish at the end of experiment 100 no of

the plants to the aquaponic sub systems after three days the radicle of b rapa was seen breaking through the seed coat and projecting out during the germination period both the plant seedlings were seen growing normally attaining similar height that was measured they were deep green with a healthy look at the end of germination period the green bean seedlings were measured 6 7 cm while b rapa was slightly shorter in height measuring 3 4 cm the seeds of p vulgaris grew faster and were distinctly taller than the seeds of b rapa they were transferred to the hydroponic sub systems after one week of germination the individual weight height of plants and width of leaves were recorded during the experiment that involved 16 plantlets of each vegetable in the individual units of the aquaponic system except for the control treatment this allowed a fairly accurate assessment of growth besides other parameters observed for the data analyses were length of roots cm length of leaves cm average total yield g average pod yield g for green beans number of pods produced and average total length of pods cm only for the green beans 2 6 physico chemical parameters of water dissolved oxygen do ph and temperature were measured using hanna instrument twice daily during the experimental period these parameters are important in assessing the condition of the rearing medium for growth of fish and plants and to ensure that the variations were within the optimum range 2 7 water nutrient concentration triplicate water samples from each of the treatment sets were transferred to 500 ml polyethylene bottle to test ammonia nitrogen nh3 n nitrite nitrogen no2 n nitrate nitrogen no3 n and phosphate po4 p as suggested by wetzel and likens 23 this analysis was performed once per 10 days all samples were filtered with a whatman filter paper of a pore size of 0 45 μm before laboratory analyses absorbance of each water sample was recorded using unico 2100 spectrophotometer these techniques are widely used due to convenience and accuracy in analysis of water in tropical as well as temperate regions 2 8 statistical analysis data pertaining to fish production and plant growth performance as well as water quality analysis were processed using microsoft excel 2010 and spss 18 0 statistical package for social sciences values were expressed as mean standard error one way anova analyses were used to test the significance p 0 05 of differences between the treatments based on the mean values of the data collected for growth performance and survival rate of fish plants as well as water quality parameters in situ and ex situ when the differences were significant at 0 05 levels the values were compared using the shapiro wilk test followed by the homogeneity test and finally tukey hsd test to further evaluate the statistical differences among the treatments 3 results and discussion 3 1 fish production table 1 shows the growth performance indicators comprising body weight gain bwg specific growth rate sgr survival rate sr feed conversion ratio fcr and total weight gain twg of the fish in the four treatments control mfs dwrs and nfs the data reveals that the weight gained by o niloticus was in the range of 33 5 0 56 g to 35 7 0 62 g the specific growth rate was 2 5 0 04 to 2 7 0 04 g day the highest survival rate varied from 93 3 4 4 to 98 3 1 6 these growth and survival values further demonstrated the remarkable adaptability and resilience of nile tilapia and suitability of this fish for aquaponic systems feed conversion ratio varied from 1 29 0 06 to 1 48 0 08 indicating high efficiency of nile tilapia in converting feed into flesh the total weight gain ranged from 630 4 3 76 g to 637 17 8 49 g the initial mean body weight bw of nile tilapia was almost the same implying lack of significant differences p 0 05 among the treatment groups the data on growth and food assimilation leaves no doubt that the environmental conditions in captivity are suitable for the fish results of this study are supported by previous studies done by al hafedh et al 14 who noticed that the survival of tilapia was more than 95 under basically similar handling conditions in the aquaponic farming however in some trials the survival of tilapia was only 78 16 likewise sgr for this species is higher in the present investigation than that reported by salam et al 9 indicating that the culture conditions were better in the aquaponic system designed for this study fcr value was similar to that reported by salama et al 24 and al hafedh et al 14 and the plausible explanation is that the aquaponic system did not significantly influence the fcr results showed no significant differences p 0 05 in wg sgr dfi twg sr in o niloticus among the four different aquaponic systems including the control set this finding suggests that performance of the systems was comparable in terms of supporting the biomass gain in the fish concordant views have been published earlier 21 12 17 10 these similarities could be linked to supply of the same types of feed starter pellet for tilapia and the ability of tilapia to make best use of nutrients reflecting the remarkable tolerance of the fish to variable culture systems the observations support the widely held view about resilience and adaptability of tilapia however the data obtained in this investigation shows that there are challenges that deserve attention because aquaponics is a relatively new research interest resilience of this fish to different factors operating in a captive environment with multiple species playing their roles has to be considered to successfully sustain the culture system through the entire production cycle 3 2 plants vegetables growth performance as the experiment was ongoing the green beans grew rapidly along the pole installed to facilitate their growth they produced twisted vine growth of b rapa was comparatively slower with distinct signs of nutrient deficiency there were indications that the plants were competing for nutrients unlike the green beans that seemed to be able to draw adequate amounts of the required nutrients number of pods produced by green beans their average length and biomass gain pointed to their positive growth performance these data on green beans and growth parameters related to chinese white cabbage average length of roots are presented in table 2 the highest average biomass gain of p vulgaris was dominated by mfs followed by dwrs and the lowest was nfs table 2 the efficiency of the system in producing green beans was as follows mfs dwrs nfs fig 3 approximately 1 kg of green beans can be produced by mfs 951 6 1 64 g and dwrs 943 3 14 4 g while the nfs yielded less than a half 380 2 97 5 g of the amount of green beans produced by mfs and dwrs fig 4 these observations are supported by the data on total number of pods produced in the three different aquaponic systems the highest total number of pods was recorded in mfs followed by dwrs and nfs most number of pods produced contributed to higher biomass gain by mfs the average number of pods produced was observed in the mfs 166 67 9 7 followed by dwrs 133 38 5 5 and nft 70 0 19 34 there were significant differences p 0 05 among the mfs dwrs and nft treatments table 2 total length of pods in nft was highest 13 26 0 27 cm followed by dwrs 12 44 0 25 cm and mfs 13 03 0 14 cm there was no significant difference p 0 05 in the total length of the pods among the treatments the differences in aquaponic systems in the recirculating aquaculture did not affect the length of the pods table 2 the results showed that the quality of green beans produced in each system was the same obviously because the source of nutrients for plants to produce pods was similar and all treatments involved extracting nutrients from the effluents originating from nile tilapia as far as b rapa is concerned only 85 3 13 4 g was produced in mfs while in dwrs and nft the values were lower 60 2 2 6 g and 54 5 10 6 g respectively table 2 study done by sace and fitzsimmons 17 reported that average yield of chinese white cabbage in aquaponic systems was 169 9 g it shows that chinese white cabbage did not achieve marketable size in this study fig 5 this is because of high competition of nutrients and space for the roots of p vulgaris and b rapa in addition the differences in physical appearance of b rapa produced from aquaponics and conventional methods of soil based cultivation were observed fig 6 less biomass gain was noted in b rapa from the aquaponic as is evident from smaller white stalk fig 6a compared to those grown in soil fig 6b however leaves showed holes that are known as shotholes and necrotic spot on the upper surface this affects the weight and sizes of the vegetable the lower biomass weight in chinese white cabbage may be related to a number of reasons including suitability of the plant for certain types of aquaponic systems the concentration of nitrate and phosphate in the water or the growth period 25 because it grew in combination with p vulgaris the plant could have suffered from competition for nutrients space and sunlight it can be seen that green beans cling and climb upwards towards the sunlight and this prevents direct sunlight on b rapa in the plant grow bed area moreover the plants did show visual nitrogen deficiency symptoms 26 27 towards the end of harvesting period as reflected by yellowing of older leaves and thin stems compared to b rapa cultivated in soils the leaves were visibly less dense in colour and stunted on the other hand despite lower biomass gain in b rapa noticed in this research a comparison has been made between the physical appearance of b rapa from aquaponic and conventional methods soil b rapa grown in soils have many small holes in leaves that give the foliage a characteristic shothole appearance possibly caused by insects this reveals the vulnerability of the plant raised in soil to insect pests especially flea beetle the symptoms were in the form of irregular yellow patches on leaves that seemed to turn yellowish brown in colour and possessed growth on both of their sides possibly caused by fungus from the soil such symptoms were absent from the plant grown in the aquaponic system thus the chances of such diseases can be greatly reduced by cultivating the vegetables in the aquaponic systems even though the biomass gain is lower than the commercial weight reported but it will be possible to stimulate growth through follow up investigations on the efficiency of aquaponic systems this will also enhance the economic viability of the aquaponic growing system by multiple cropping better market value and reducing loss due to diseases the longest roots observed in p vulgaris was in mfs 77 7 3 56 cm followed by dwrs 65 95 4 47 cm and nft 60 07 3 06 cm while in the case of b rapa the data obtained were mfs 23 07 3 56 cm nft 21 53 3 06 cm dwrs 22 0 1 6 cm table 2 the length of the roots showed no significant difference p 0 05 between the three treatments the total length of roots in the two vegetables is shown in fig 7 it is evident that the roots of p vulgaris were much longer than those of b rapa longer roots provided greater surface area for attachment of microbial organisms that help in breakdown of many types of compounds including conversion of ammonia to nitrite and nitrite to nitrate 7 12 13 18 plants with larger root surface area have unique advantage in aquaponic systems since different plants have different growth characteristics and nitrogen utilization capacity 28 13 besides as stated earlier important factors regulating plant nutrient uptake include nutrient availability stage of growth growth rate root zone temperature as well as different types of plant roots 29 these factors can act collectively to influence growth of the plant and its health and resilience substrate in the form of gravel and submerged plant roots in mfs provide surface area for attachment of bacteria that help in conversion of toxic chemicals into non toxic substances improving water quality and absorption of nutrients through the plant roots 7 13 plant roots in dwrs are also fully submerged in the water and facilitate the beneficial bacterial activity as explained above for mfs system 15 concordant views have been published by shete et al 30 who emphasized that the flooded hydroponic systems provide maximum surface area and sufficient time for nutrient utilization by the plants while in nfs a thin film of water is available in the hydroponics tank pvc the plant roots are only partially submerged in water according to herbert and herbert 15 even though the plant roots are only partially submerged in the water the portion exposed to air helps in oxygen uptake even though it reduces area for attachment of bacteria and limits the absorption of inorganic nutrients besides providing anchorage and support it can be said that mfs and dwrs are more efficient in terms of plant or fruit biomass production than nfs 3 3 water quality parameters average values of temperature c dissolved oxygen do mg l and ph in the three different aquaponic systems are shown in table 3 the data reveals that the mean s e of temperature ranged from 25 26 0 25 c to 25 92 0 4 c do varied from 6 48 0 15 mg l to 6 77 0 15 mg l and ph was in the range of 6 96 0 07 to 7 16 0 07 statistically there was no significant difference p 0 05 between these four aquaponic sub systems and the control set in temperature c dissolved oxygen do and ph based on these observations and recorded data values of temperature do level and temperature in each aquaponic system fall within the favourable range required for tilapia 24 moreover value of ph during the experiments was within the optimum range since conversion of ammonia to nitrite is effective between 5 8 mg l to 8 5 mg l it is worth noticing that the empirical data emphasized the importance of integrating plant crops for mitigating the toxic effects of ammonia in cultured stocks 12 10 several water quality factors need to be considered throughout the experiment to observe the effect of differences in water quality in the three different aquaponic systems especially vis a vis temperature c dissolved oxygen mg l and ph as well as the concentration of total nitrogen ammonia nitrite and nitrate within the aquaponic systems the overall goal of water quality evaluation should be recognized as an essential element for maintaining a healthy ecosystem that supports a healthy farming system for aquatic animals fish plants and beneficial bacteria 27 nitrification is affected by the environmental factors such as ph temperature presence of organic matter and substrates used as well as concentrations of o2 nh3 and no2 in the experimental trials conducted by salama et al 24 and daudpota et al 31 the water quality was within the acceptable range for tilapia culture with temperature varying from 22 c to 30 c in the present study the temperature varied from 25 26 c to 25 92 c salama et al 24 reported optimal temperature for growth of tilapia was 25 c to 28 c in aquaponic system designed for this research the temperature range appeared suitable for growth of nile tilapia the concentration of do recorded was above the values reported by daudpota et al 31 showing that the results obtained in this study were better for tilapia growth in addition to production from the hydroponic arrangement the system also releases oxygen to the atmosphere through the root systems 15 besides high concentration of dissolved oxygen in the root zone is one of the factors that could contribute to increase in fresh mass of plants the ph ranged between 6 96 0 07 to 7 16 0 07 throughout the experiment and this was within the acceptable range for fish culture as well as cultivation of plants as stated by ho 26 while the normal range of ph in the hydroponic cultivation is generally between 5 7 5 but even 5 5 6 5 has given good results generally farmers maintain a ph 6 5 9 but prefer slightly alkaline medium in this range all mentioned parameters were within the optimal range for culturing nile tilapia 14 16 research on integrating nile tilapia together with water spinach ipomoea aquatic as carried out by danaher et al 16 indicated no significant difference p 0 05 between water quality parameters observed temperature dissolved oxygen and ph 3 4 water nutrients concentrations the water nutrient concentrations of nh3 n no2n no3 n and po4 p in the three aquaponic systems varied as shown in table 4 nutrient concentrations of nh3n no2 n no3 n and po4 p in each system mfs dwrs and nft decreased with the duration of culture except for the control treatment fig 8 as supported by shete et al 30 where the value of overall nitrogen reduction in the aquaponic system showed better results than control treatment without aquaponic system no significant differences p 0 05 were detected in the dynamics of nh3 n and no2 n unlike significant differences p 0 05 in the concentrations of no3 n and po4 p among the four systems including the control treatment the average of highest levels of accumulated nh3 n no2 n no3 n and po4 p in the three aquaponic systems including the control system were 0 29 0 11 g l 0 61 0 19 mg l 1 17 0 32 mg l and 0 57 0 2 mg l respectively these values were well within the range of optimal requirements for tilapia culture 32 the decline of nutrient concentrations within the aquaponic systems was due to their utilization by plants and bacteria the concentration of nh3 n in the four aquaponic systems including the control treatment was high in the beginning of the experiment and maintained a decreasing trend in the first 20 days this can be explained by the slow growth of the nitrifying bacteria 5 13 18 probably there were not enough nitrifying bacteria to carry out the nitrification process efficiently 28 at this early stage nitrifying bacteria would multiply and the accumulation of nh3 n is caused by the presence of nitrogen in the aquaponic system introduced by waste from the fish as well as nutrient leaching from the feed occurrence of nh3 n in the water column could trigger the ammonia oxidizing bacteria to turn it into no2 n while the nitrite oxidizing bacteria especially nicrobacter spp and nitrospira spp degrade it to nitrate 28 10 low nitrogen concentration in the water column may be due to removal of most of the ammonia nitrite and nitrate by an active microbial population and this enabled the roots of the plant to grow rapidly and absorb the nutrients 2 no2 n is a transition ion during the nitrification process and exhibits lower toxicity than nh3 n the concentration of no2 n was maintained below 2 mg l and it decreased throughout the experiment because of the abundance of ammonia oxidizing bacteria responsible for the rate limiting step of nitrification 33 while the concentration of no3 n steadily decreased with a steady fall between 10 30 days a rapid development of plant roots that occurred could have been a contributory factor in combating the accumulation of no3 n in the aquaponic systems the concentration of no3 n in the control treatment changed little because of the absence of plants and was possibly caused by the denitrification process that occurred in the system the decreasing values of nh3 n no2 n and no3 n supported that the plants to use surface area of roots for efficient nutrient utilization 30 the concentration of po4 p in the four treatments showed a declining trend during the 70 days of the experiment in the present study the main source of phosphorus in the aquaculture system was artificial feed only a minor percentage of phosphorus is available for incorporation into fish biomass 32 removal of phosphate that seemed to have started from the early stages indicated that the phosphorus is needed continuously for root development which occurred at greater rate initially 29 lin et al 2 suggested that removal of phosphate in the aquaponic system is caused by uptake by the plants as well as its deposition in the gravel 3 5 economic feasibility of small scale aquaponic sub systems economic feasibility needed to be evaluated to determine the benefits of the aquaponic systems developed in this study and to compare their importance vis a vis other ways of farming of fish and vegetables the lowest cost of production of 1m2 aquaponic systems was only usd 43 39 for mfs followed by dwrs usd 48 10 and nfs amounting to usd 56 64 data presented in table 5 provides the profitability of applying the aquaponics technique for aquatic farming at a commercial scale it is evident from the data that the production of aquaculture earned usd28 80 as profit as compared usd 38 88 from hydroponics and usd 67 76 through aquaponic system the value is only for 1m2 and this was double from that of the aquaculture and hydroponic systems besides the lowest cost of production of aquaponic system is seen from mfs that offered the most efficient production compared to dwrs and nfs after 6 months the profit gained using the mfs was almost twice generating approximately usd 24 28 for 1 m2 4 conclusion this study indicates that the three developed aquaponic sub systems mfs dwrs and nfs did not significantly influence the growth performance of nile tilapia oreochromis niloticus in terms of weight gain specific growth rate feed conversion ratio and survival rate the changes in water quality parameters revealed that the reduced nutrient levels were caused by the utilization and absorption by plants for their growth the developed aquaponic systems showed that these were not only suitable for an integrated system for biomass production of plants but also useful for reusing the nutrient rich water available in the aquaculture system the importance of this study is that it gives an overview to the beginners and also to the farmers intending to apply these three types of aquaponic systems in cultivating tilapia together with green beans and chinese white cabbage they all are suitable and can be adapted depending on the species combinations the production of fish and plant those crops can be estimated by referring to the data provided in this study it can be considered that aquaponic system is more profitable than fish production alone however more research must be done on these technique for better results acknowledgments special thanks to the ministry of education malaysia for providing financial support under

important sources of drinking water that may contain many natural constituents as iron manganese hydrogen sulphide ammonia fluoride chloride sulphate and radionuclides radon radium uranium barium in concentrations that do not always meet the drinking water quality requirements the concentrations of some compounds as iron manganese ammonia hydrogen sulphide and radiological parameters in the groundwater of estonia from cambrian vendian aquifer used as a drinking water source exceed 1 the threshold limits and indicative dose of 0 1 msv year for radiological parameter set in the council directives of the european union 2 3 and in the estonian regulatory act 4 problems of drinking water radioactivity exist not only in estonia but in a number of european countries 5 8 usa 9 in the middle east and the persian gulf 10 high concentrations of uranium and radium in norwegian and greece waters have been determined 5 6 a study carried out in upper silesia poland and the czech republic on water from underground aquifers intended for human consumption showed high levels of radioactivity mainly due to radium 7 high concentrations of radionuclides such as radium uranium tritium in drinking water have been determined in usa 9 in spite of the current legislation 3 radioactivity is not systematically monitored at european level however this is an environmental problem that cannot be solved at source as it is generated by the groundwater dilution of minerals rich in radioactive isotopes mainly from 238u and 232th series in order to satisfy the demands for safe water viimsi parish northern estonia 15 km east from capital of estonia tallinn constructed a water treatment plant wtp that uses comprehensive and complex combined technology fig 1 for water purification 11 12 in the first step stripping with oxygen is applied for oxidising of manganese mn2 and ferrous iron fe2 ions that in well water occur as soluble ferrous and manganese bicarbonates to manganese hydroxide

best available technologies selected by u s epa 16 on the basis of their efficacy and affordability in the removal of radionuclides from drinking water the efficient design and operation of water quality control system of the viimsi wtp allow the drinking water supplier to get water of potable quality as well as to make it palatable and aesthetically attractive for human consumption moreover the viimsi wtp is the first industrial scale water treatment facility in estonia specially designed for radium removal in spite of the high quality of the drinking water supplied soon after the commissioning of the facility in viimsi it became evident that water purification from radionuclides creates a new problem as radium isotopes accumulate in the filter materials to an extent where the exemption values 17 for radium are exceeded this is not a problem of the technology used at the viimsi wtp as accumulation of radionuclides may occur even if the technology aims at only iron and manganese or nh4 removal as radium co precipitates in oxidation and adsorbed in ion exchange process using manganese dioxide based and zeolite filter materials respectively thus in spite of the applications of manganese dioxide based 18 and zeolites 19 21 filter materials are effective in water treatment these treatment methods produce large volumes of naturally occurring radioactive materials norm containing wastes posing major difficulties in their disposal radium sorbed iron and manganese precipitates trapped in the manganese dioxide based filter bed and as recommended by manufactures should be subsequently eliminated during the water backwashing with the slow filter penetration of solids is superficial and cleaning is achieved by removing the upper layer of the medium at intervals of a few months washing and replacing when the bed depth falls below a specified value in addition the decreased oxidising ability functionality of the filter material catalytic centres can be restored by the regeneration with potassium permanganate kmno4 that may serve also as a disinfectant against iron reducing or ammonium oxidizing bacteria 22 and an oxidant of the organic matter e g humic acids if they present 23 complexed with the iron zeolite contaminated by natural constituents e g nh4 of groundwater can be regenerated by nacl kcl and naoh for example complete regeneration of zeolite contaminated with nh4 by a 1 n nacl solution was achieved 24 a 0 6 m nacl treatment resulted in 95 of adsorbed nh4 recovery in a regenerated zeolite column 25 a 0 001 m naoh treatment allowed achieving 80 of fluoride desorption from zeolite 21 however scarce data on the recovery of zeolite and manganese dioxide based filter materials could be found in literature as typically these materials are not developed for the regeneration purposes in spite of norm accumulation in the filter bed is a current major source of the exposed materials utilization difficulties the studies on recovery of radionuclides contaminated zeolite and manganese dioxide based filter materials to our knowledge are not published in addition the mechanism of radionuclides removal by the specific filtration materials that may help to facilitate the understanding of and the application of the methods for the materials regeneration is not elucidated in the present study the regeneration methods of the filtration materials contaminated by naturally occurring radioactive compounds were developed relying on the chemistry and mechanism of the compounds removal the efficacy of the combined application of water backwashing integrated or combined with air scouring and chemical regeneration with kmno4 and nacl or kcl for the purification of the filter materials contaminated with radium iron manganese and ammonium as well as for the restoration of their functional properties was evaluated both on lab and pilot scales the elaboration of cost effective and environmentally acceptable technology for regeneration of norm contaminated filter materials considerably contributes to the environmentally economically and socially sustainable drinking water treatment 2 materials and methods

container 228ra was analysed through the gamma peaks of ac 228 338 32 911 20 968 96 kev as radium isotopes act chemically identically only 228ra activity concentrations were measured this gives sufficient information to fulfill the aim of the study determining the efficiency of radium removal in the regeneration process measurement of 226ra is slightly more complicated and could introduce larger uncertainties in order to measure 226ra with the abovementioned analysis procedure one would need at least three weeks of waiting time between sample sealing and measurement because 226ra is

masterflex cole parmer instrument co usa to control the rate of inflow during the regeneration experiments the kcl 1 3 m and or kmno4 0 02 m solutions were used for regeneration of the fmh and zeolite

water passed through the filter bed in the column experiment 2 5 filter materials regeneration on a pilot scale a pilot scale set up was constructed based on the similar technological scheme to that adopted for the real application at the viimsi wtp the flow sheet of the pilot scale set up fig 1 consisted of a pre aeration with injector an intermediate oxidation tank to provide a required residence time of 1 2 min for iron and manganese oxidation a venture type centrifugal degassing separation unit gas degas technology mazzei co usa and filtration columns a 2 2 m long with nominal diameters of 0 24 m and 0 18 m filled with fmh and zeolite respectively the columns were packed with 70 kg and 30 kg at the bulk density of 1 35 kg l and 0 89 kg l and the height filter bed of 1 2 m and 1 5 m of fmh and zeolite respectively the filtration column was packed with the gravel 15 cm height filter bed then with sand 60 and 40 cm height filter bed for fmh and zeolite packed columns respectively at the bottom to have the fmh or zeolite at the top thus reserving the smaller voids to trap the really fine particles moreover such a bed composition of a less dense top layer of fmh particles size 0 425 0 85 mm or zeolite particles size 1 2 5 mm and a denser lower layer of a 0 5 mm sand allows remaining in this configuration after backwashing the fmh was water backwashed before

3 results and discussion 3 1 shaker and column experiments on manganese dioxide based filter material fmh regeneration the filtration technology using manganese dioxide based materials and zeolite has been considered 16 18 21 as a promising treatment method for the removal of different natural compounds found in excess in water however this treatment method produces large volumes of norm containing wastes posing major difficulties in their disposal thus the filtration materials require chemical regeneration the effectiveness of the regeneration process is not completely predictable based on the current metrics relied upon manganese iron radionuclides content in the filter material doses of the regenerating chemicals contact time filter material properties etc this is true even when the literature demonstrates that this method is known to recover the material and has been effective at other sites lab scale studies costs less and requires less much time than a properly designed pilot study thus some parameters as doses of the chemicals for regeneration of the filter material the treatment time and the backwash mode were optimized on a lab scale for the following technological transfer to a set up of a higher capacity the chemicals kmno4 and kcl were tested for regeneration of the iron manganese and 228ra contaminated fmh catalytic filter material at the shaker while the increase in the dose of kmno4 did not influence removal of iron and 228ra the increase in the kcl dose improved the removal within 24 h fig 5 the removal of manganese was only slightly improved with the increase of kcl dose and was not dependent on the kmno4 considering the chemistry and mechanism of natural contaminants removal by the fmh filtration iron and manganese particulates formed due to iron and manganese oxidation on catalytic centres of manganese dioxide fig 6 were trapped in the filter bed both iron and manganese oxides as well as mixed fe mn oxides are known to sorb ra from aqueous solution onto oxide surface fig 6 where the ra sorption relative capacities are as follows mno2 mno2 fe oh 3 fe oh 3 33 the optimum ph range for sorption of 228ra to mno2 is of 4 8 34 sorption of ra is mainly controlled by a surface charge effect at low ph 4 the surface layer of mno2 is positively charged due to the h developed on the surface this prevents diffusion of positively charged alkaline earth species into the surface layers at higher ph values 4 8 adsorption of positively charged species is higher because more functional oh groups develop on the surface allowing positively charged species to undergo surface complexation 35 thus the highest sorption yield of positively charged radium was observed at ph of 6 8 35 in this ph range the predominant species of radium in the groundwater are bicarbonate species ra hco3 36 the surface reaction of divalent ions x2 with oxide surfaces summarised by taffarel and rubio 37 are the following 1 association of the free metal ion with a surface hydroxyl group ion exchange with h eq 8 2 adsorption and formation of a hydrolysis complex eq 9 3 formation of a bidentate complex eq 10 8 mnoh x2 mnox h 9 mnoh x2 h2o mnoxoh 2h 10 2 mnoh x2 mno 2x 2h according to this reaction mechanism eqs 8 10 more x2 onto oxide surface more h are released lowering the medium ph this may explain a slight decrease in the ph of water from initial 7 9 7 7 after the fmh filtration fig 1 at ph higher than 6 0 the formation of the metals mn fe hydrolyses complex x oh increases and both x2 and x oh are adsorbed in complex forms existing as mnox and mnoxoh eqs 8 and 9 respectively 37 according to the similar mechanism ra2 is also expected to be absorbed on mno2 catalytic centres of manganese dioxide filter material fig 6 basically iron and oxygen are attracted to the manganese dioxide catalytic centres where they are retained long enough to react causing precipitation this material can also precipitate iron if there is no oxygen present in the water the reaction occurs when mno2 is reduced to mno and ferric hydroxide is precipitated eq 11 11 mno2 2fe hco3 2 h2o mno 2fe oh 3 4co2 h2o during the water backwashing the surface of this material is cleaned by removing the mno and mnoraoh in case of ra sorption this exposes fresh mno2 which is used to oxidize iron in order to restore the catalytic properties of manganese dioxide based filter material it is regenerated with kmno4 according to reaction eq 12 12 3 mno 2kmno4 h2o mno2 2koh 2mno2 12 increasing of the dose of kcl added step wised substantially improved 228ra removal fig 7 the regeneration of manganese dioxide based filter material with kcl was more effective than that with kmno4 however the dose of kcl needed was also substantially higher the observed removal of iron and manganese by kcl could be explained by desorption of iron and manganese from the filter material surface the mno2 catalytic centres of the filter material are restored by the ion exchange of potassium with the metal ion associated with oxide surface hydroxyl group eq 13 13 mnox 2 k mnok2 x2 chloride absorbs to the goethite and manganite particulates according to eqs 14 and 15 and subsequently removed during the water backwashing 14 feoox cl feooxcl 15 mnoox cl mnooxcl cleaning of the manganese dioxide based filter material surface from the radium sorbed iron and manganese particulates as well as from mnoraoh depended on the water backwashing operating conditions fig 8 the application of compressed air scouring simultaneously with the water backwashing the operating mode ii fig 4 improved cleaning of the filter material compared to that achieved by the water backwashing alone the backwash i fig 4 increased removal of iron up to 18 manganese up to 4 and 228ra up to 17 was observed without the changes in the water consumption 10 6 l per 400 g of fmh increasing of washwater inflow rate from 720 ml min the operating mode i fig 4 to 1020 ml min water consumption increased from 10 6 l to 13 6 l per 400 g of fmh without supplementary air scouring the backwash iii fig 4 resulted in a substantial improvement in the iron removal from 4 to 15 without substantial changes in the manganese from 2 to 4 and radium from 13 to 14 removal increased number of water backwashing cycles and introducing of air scouring prior to each water backwashing cycle in the backwash iv considerably improved the removal of manganese up to 8 and radium up to 22 however did not influence the efficiency of iron removal compared to that obtained by the backwash ii fig 4 air and water consumption in the backwash iv was the highest and comprised of 143 l and 17 3 l per 400 g of the filter material respectively the upward flow of water expands the bed producing a fluidized condition in which accumulated iron and manganese particulates desorbed from the particles as the backwash water is admitted to the bottom of the filter the bed begins to expand and there is an initial head loss iron and manganese particulates were allowed to escape as the bed expands further the rate of head loss decreases and when the whole bed is just suspended the head loss becomes constant the content of tsd fig 8 inset measured in the column effluent after each backwash did not change during twenty backwash cycles the backwash iv fig 4 thus increase in the backwash water inflow rate the backwash iii fig 4 or applying of air scouring the backwash ii fig 4 increases the expansion but not the head loss excessive expansion is not desirable since the particles will be forced further apart scouring action will be reduced and the backwash water consumption will be increased in the column experiments the chemical regeneration of manganese dioxide based filter material with kmno4 was supplemented with the water backwashing in combination with chemical regeneration water backwashing is a feasible way to improve the removal of iron and manganese particulates from the filter media water backwashing is also required for washing out of the chemical after the regeneration water backwashing using the similar operating regime to that applied at the viimsi wtp was able to remove radium sorbed iron and manganese particulates fig 9 addition of the chemical all at once or step wised with total kmno4 dose of 3 g kg did not substantially influence the iron and manganese particulates removal from the filter material and as a result the radium removal doubled dose of kmno4 applied in two steps allowed substantially improving the manganese removal with slight increase in the radium removal that can be explained by more effective cleaning the material surface from mno and mnoraoh in case of sorbed radium eq 12 the removal of radium was not substantially improved with the addition of both regenerating chemicals in moderate doses total doses were 750 g of kcl and 3 g of kmno4 per kg of the filter material indicating in no need for additional expenses for another chemical handling at least at present level of the contaminants accumulation similar results were obtained by the doubled kmno4 dose a 2 step addition of 3 g kmno4 indicating in no need for additional expenses for another chemical handling the regeneration of manganese dioxide based filter material fmh with both kcl and kmno4 chemicals did not reduce the filter material ability to remove iron manganese and radium table 2 indicating the tested chemicals safety for the restoring of the filter material functional properties 3 2 shaker and column experiments on zeolite regeneration the chemicals such as nacl and kcl were tested for a 24 h regeneration of the zeolite at the shaker the increase in the dose either of the chemicals increased the removal of 228ra fig 10 this effect was more profound for the zeolite treated with kcl according to the selectivity of zeolite related to cations it is more selective to potassium ion k than to sodium ion na this makes the regeneration with the kcl of a higher efficiency than that with the nacl after the contact of zeolite with the regenerating solution such as kcl exchange of k from the solution with exchangeable cation ra2 or nh4 from the zeolite z framework occurs eqs 16 and 17 16 z2ra 2k 2zk ra2 17 znh4 k zk nh4 in the experiments performed at the shaker a 2 step addition of kcl the dose of kcl and the regeneration time in each step were 250 g kg of zeolite and 24 h respectively and prolongation of the treatment time resulted in the 228ra removal increase from 71 obtained with the same total dose added all at once and treatment time of 24 h to 84 fig 10 the prolongation of the treatment time from 6 to 24 h and increase in the dose of the regenerating chemical from 65 to 195 g kcl kg were found to be effective for the zeolite treatment in the column experiments fig 11 step wised addition of the chemical did not result in 228ra removal improvement in spite of the zeolite water backwashing was not aimed at 228ra removal it is required to be applied to wash out the regenerating chemical kcl iron and manganese were not found in the backwash water in the zeolite filter media the concentrations were less that the method detection limit as they were removed from the treated water by the pre filtration through manganese dioxide based filter material bed fig 1 the concentration of nh4 in the backwash water varied from 1 to 10 7 mg l depending on the regenerating chemical addition mode single or step wise and dose for example the concentrations of nh4 in backwash water were 10 7 and 1 1 mg l at added all at once kcl doses of 195 g and 65 g per kg of zeolite respectively reduced treatment time of 6 h dose of kcl 195 g kg of zeolite decreased the removal of ammonium from zeolite resulting in the concentration of 1 1 mg nh4 l of washwater the reduction in the competitive compounds as iron and manganese load in the treated water during the manganese dioxide based material filtration treatment step supported the effective removal of ra2 and nh4 during the following filtration through the zeolite opposite to manganese dioxide based filter material where radium is mainly sorbed to manganese and iron particulates intended to be removed during the water backwashing zeolite exchanges its sodium ions for ra2 and nh4 in the water making therefore the chemical regeneration of the filtration material for the ions removal from the zeolite framework of necessity reduction in functionality of the regenerated zeolite was not observed in the material reuse experiment table 2 indicating in no loss of the filter material ability to remove ra2 and nh4 the parameters of the water passed through the regenerated filter material bed did not exceed potable water threshold limits and radiological parametric value of 0 1 msv year for indicative dose set in the estonian regulatory act 4 allowing for the material following reuse 3 3 pilot scale experiments on manganese dioxide based filter material fmh and zeolite regeneration the regeneration of the filter materials relies on the chemical reaction of the chemicals that certainly needs careful optimization of the doses reaction time and the reagents feeding manner to reactor before the technological transfer to a real scale in order to obtain safe and reliable drinking water quality carefully designed pilot scale study considerably simplifies the implementation of the process for a real scale application the water backwashing kmno4 regeneration a 2 step addition of kmno4 at the dose of 2 2 g kg of fmh water backwashing resulted in 63 of 228ra 84 of iron and 96 of manganese removal from the contaminated manganese dioxide based filter material in a pilot scale experiment table 3 the water backwashing kcl regeneration a 14 step addition of kcl at the dose of 53 6 g kg of zeolite total dose of 750 g kcl kg of zeolite water backwashing of a zeolite filter bed implemented as a final polishing step to remove the residual concentration of radium in treated water allowed removing 34 of 228ra table 3 the reduction in the functionality of the regenerated fmh and zeolite was not observed in the material reuse experiment table 2 indicating in no loss of the filter material ability to remove contaminants the parameters of the water such as iron manganese and ammonium passed through the regenerated manganese dioxide based and zeolite filter materials did not exceed potable water threshold limits table 2 set in the estonian regulatory act 4 and the complete removal of the radium was achieved this indicated that the regenerating chemicals did not have a negative effect on the material functional properties allowing for the materials following reuse in general large amount of radionuclides may be accumulated in the filter media backwashing and chemical regeneration at regular intervals however enable safe daily use of the filter materials radionuclides sorbed on manganese and iron particulates may be removed from the manganese dioxide based filter material particles and drained into the sewer the functional properties of the filter material are restored by the treatment with kmno4 solution in case of zeolite the ion exchange capacity of radium and nh4 contaminated material is restored by kcl and the worked out solution of regenerated chemical is rinsed out with water radioactive liquid wastes are produced when these filter materials are chemically regenerated or water backwashed thus in choosing a regeneration chemical and regeneration technology should also keep in mind the frequency of the chemical regeneration and the water backwashing as 228ra activity concentration in the effluent after the chemical regeneration of strongly contaminated manganese dioxide based filter material and zeolite table 3 reached up to 100 bq l and 2000 bq l respectively thus the higher the activity concentration of radionuclides and the daily water consumption the more often water backwashing and chemical regeneration should be carried out the regeneration interval should be frequent enough to prevent this technique from causing a problem of waste disposal according to recommendations of the finnish radiation and nuclear safety authority 8 if fe and mn removal methods are used and backwashing or regeneration is carried out about once a week the liquid be discharged into the sewer and after use the spent matrix be discharged into communal dumps thus the water backwashing chemical regeneration water backwashing at regular intervals results in the filter materials complete exhaustion delay by restoring their functionality and in the decrease of norm containing waste accumulation that contributes in a major way towards environmental protection 4 conclusions cleaning of the manganese dioxide based filter material fmh surface from the radium sorbed iron and manganese particulates as well as from mnoraoh formed as result of mno2 reduction to mno accompanied by the radium sorption depended on the backwash water flow compressed air scouring prior to or at the same time as water backwashing improved cleaning and reduced backwash water consumption increased dose of kmno4 added step wised also allowed substantially improving the manganese removal with slight increase in radium removal the addition of kmno4 restored the catalytic properties of the filter material by converting of the reduced mno to mno2 increase in the dose either of the nacl or kcl regenerating chemicals and the prolongation of the treatment time improved the removal of 228ra from the zeolite framework by the ion exchange the effect was more profound for the zeolite treated with kcl due to stronger cation exchange selectivity of k over na in spite of the water backwashing did not influence 288ra removal it is required to be applied to wash out the regenerating chemical kcl the reduction in the functionality of the regenerated manganese dioxide based and zeolite filter materials was not observed during the following reuse the parameters of water passed through the decontaminated filter media satisfied the threshold limits set for drinking water quality by the estonian and european

important sources of drinking water that may contain many natural constituents as iron manganese hydrogen sulphide ammonia fluoride chloride sulphate and radionuclides radon radium uranium barium in concentrations that do not always meet the drinking water quality requirements the concentrations of some compounds as iron manganese ammonia hydrogen sulphide and radiological parameters in the groundwater of estonia from cambrian vendian aquifer used as a drinking water source exceed 1 the threshold limits and indicative dose of 0 1 msv year for radiological parameter set in the council

middle east and the persian gulf 10 high concentrations of uranium and radium in norwegian and greece waters have been determined 5 6 a study carried out in upper silesia poland and the czech republic on water from underground aquifers intended for human consumption showed high levels of radioactivity mainly due to radium 7 high concentrations of radionuclides such as radium uranium tritium in drinking water have been determined in usa 9 in spite of the current legislation 3 radioactivity is not systematically monitored at european level however this is an environmental problem that cannot be solved at source as it is generated by the groundwater dilution of minerals rich in radioactive isotopes mainly from 238u and 232th series in order to satisfy the demands for safe water viimsi

best available technologies selected by u s epa 16 on the basis of their efficacy and affordability in the removal of radionuclides from drinking water the efficient design and operation of water quality control system of the viimsi wtp allow the drinking water supplier to get water of potable quality as well as to make it palatable and aesthetically attractive for human consumption moreover the viimsi wtp is the first industrial scale water treatment facility in estonia specially designed for radium removal in spite of the high quality of the drinking water supplied soon after the commissioning of the facility in viimsi it became evident that water purification from radionuclides creates a new problem as radium isotopes accumulate in the filter materials to an extent where the exemption values 17 for radium are exceeded this is not a problem of the technology used at the viimsi wtp as accumulation of radionuclides may occur even if the technology aims at only iron and manganese or nh4 removal as radium co precipitates in oxidation and adsorbed in ion exchange process using manganese dioxide based and zeolite filter materials respectively thus in spite of the applications of manganese dioxide based 18 and zeolites 19 21 filter materials are effective in water treatment these treatment methods produce large volumes of naturally occurring radioactive materials norm containing wastes posing major difficulties in their disposal radium sorbed iron and manganese precipitates trapped in the manganese dioxide based filter bed and as recommended by manufactures should be subsequently eliminated during the water backwashing with the slow filter penetration of solids is superficial and cleaning is achieved by removing the upper layer of the medium at intervals of a few months washing and replacing when the bed depth falls below a specified value in addition the decreased oxidising ability functionality of the filter material catalytic centres can be restored by the regeneration with potassium permanganate kmno4 that may serve also as a disinfectant against iron reducing or ammonium oxidizing bacteria 22 and an oxidant of the organic matter e g humic acids if they present 23 complexed with the iron zeolite contaminated by natural constituents e g nh4 of groundwater can be regenerated by nacl kcl and naoh for example complete regeneration of zeolite contaminated with nh4 by a 1 n nacl solution was achieved 24 a 0 6 m nacl treatment resulted in 95 of adsorbed nh4 recovery in a regenerated zeolite column 25 a 0 001 m naoh treatment allowed achieving 80 of fluoride desorption from zeolite 21 however scarce data on the recovery of zeolite and manganese dioxide based filter materials could be found in literature as typically these materials are not developed for the regeneration purposes in spite of norm accumulation in the filter bed is a current major source of the exposed materials utilization difficulties the studies on recovery of radionuclides contaminated zeolite and manganese dioxide based filter materials to our knowledge are not published in addition the mechanism of radionuclides removal by the specific filtration materials that may help to facilitate the understanding of and the application of the methods for the materials regeneration is not elucidated in the present study the regeneration methods of the filtration materials contaminated by naturally occurring radioactive compounds were developed relying on the chemistry and mechanism of the compounds removal the efficacy of the combined application of water backwashing integrated or combined with air scouring and chemical regeneration with kmno4 and nacl or kcl for the purification of the filter materials contaminated with radium iron manganese and ammonium as well as for the restoration of their functional properties was evaluated both on lab and pilot scales the elaboration of cost effective and environmentally acceptable technology for regeneration of norm contaminated filter materials considerably contributes to the environmentally economically and socially sustainable drinking water treatment 2 materials and methods

container 228ra was analysed through the gamma peaks of ac 228 338 32 911 20 968 96 kev as radium isotopes act chemically identically only 228ra activity concentrations were measured this gives sufficient information to fulfill the aim of the study determining the efficiency of radium removal in the regeneration process measurement of 226ra is slightly more complicated and could introduce larger uncertainties in order to measure 226ra with the abovementioned analysis procedure one would need at least three weeks of waiting time between sample sealing and measurement because 226ra is

masterflex cole parmer instrument co usa to control the rate of inflow during the regeneration experiments the kcl 1 3 m and or kmno4 0 02 m solutions were used for regeneration of the fmh and zeolite

respectively 300 l of the water were pumped downward with the inflow rate of 100 115 ml min conductivity ph total iron total manganese and nh4 were measured in the column effluent after each 50 l of water passed through the filter bed in the column experiment 2 5 filter materials regeneration on a pilot scale a pilot scale set up was constructed based on the similar technological scheme to that adopted for the real application at the viimsi wtp the flow sheet of the pilot scale set up fig 1 consisted of a pre aeration with injector an intermediate oxidation tank to provide a required residence time of 1 2 min for iron and manganese oxidation a venture type centrifugal degassing separation unit gas degas technology mazzei co usa and filtration columns a 2 2 m long with nominal diameters of 0 24 m and 0 18 m filled with fmh and zeolite respectively the columns were packed with 70 kg and 30 kg at the bulk density of 1 35 kg l and 0 89 kg l and the height filter bed of 1 2 m and 1 5 m of fmh and zeolite respectively the filtration column was packed with the gravel 15 cm height filter bed then with sand 60 and 40 cm height filter bed for fmh and zeolite packed columns respectively at the bottom to have the fmh or zeolite at the top thus reserving the smaller voids to trap the really fine particles moreover such a bed composition of a less dense top layer of fmh particles size 0 425 0 85 mm or zeolite particles size 1 2 5 mm and a denser lower layer of a 0 5 mm sand allows remaining in this configuration after backwashing the fmh was water backwashed before

3 results and discussion 3 1 shaker and column experiments on manganese dioxide based filter material fmh regeneration the filtration technology using manganese dioxide based materials and zeolite has been considered 16 18 21 as a promising treatment method for the removal of different natural compounds found in excess in water however this treatment method produces large volumes of norm containing wastes posing major difficulties in their disposal thus the filtration materials require chemical regeneration the effectiveness of the regeneration process is not completely predictable based on the current metrics relied upon manganese iron radionuclides content in the filter material doses of the regenerating chemicals contact time filter material properties etc this is true even when the literature demonstrates that this method is known to recover the material and has been effective at other sites lab scale studies costs less and requires less much time than a properly designed pilot study thus some parameters as doses of the chemicals for regeneration of the filter material the treatment time and the backwash mode were optimized on a lab scale for the following technological transfer to a set up of a higher capacity the chemicals kmno4 and kcl were tested for regeneration of the iron manganese and 228ra contaminated fmh catalytic filter material at the shaker while the increase in the dose of kmno4 did not influence removal of iron and 228ra the increase in the kcl dose improved the removal within 24 h fig 5 the removal of manganese was only slightly improved with the increase of kcl dose and was not dependent on the kmno4 considering the chemistry and mechanism of natural contaminants removal by the fmh filtration iron and manganese particulates formed due to iron and manganese oxidation on catalytic centres of manganese dioxide fig 6 were trapped in the filter bed both iron and manganese oxides as well as mixed fe mn oxides are known to sorb ra from aqueous solution onto oxide surface fig 6 where the ra sorption relative capacities are as follows mno2 mno2 fe oh 3 fe oh 3 33 the optimum ph range for sorption of 228ra to mno2 is of 4 8 34 sorption of ra is mainly controlled by a surface charge effect at low ph 4 the surface layer of mno2 is positively charged due to the h developed on the surface this prevents diffusion of positively charged alkaline earth species into the surface layers at higher ph values 4 8 adsorption of positively charged species is higher because more functional oh groups develop on the surface allowing positively charged species to undergo surface complexation 35 thus the highest sorption yield of positively charged radium was observed at ph of 6 8 35 in this ph range the predominant species of radium in the groundwater are bicarbonate species ra hco3 36 the surface reaction of divalent ions x2 with oxide surfaces summarised by taffarel and rubio 37 are the following 1 association of the free metal ion with a surface hydroxyl group ion exchange with h eq 8 2 adsorption and formation of a hydrolysis complex eq 9 3 formation of a bidentate complex eq 10 8 mnoh x2 mnox h 9 mnoh x2 h2o mnoxoh 2h 10 2 mnoh x2 mno 2x 2h according to this reaction mechanism eqs 8 10 more x2 onto oxide surface more h are released lowering the medium ph this may explain a slight decrease in the ph of water from initial 7 9 7 7 after the fmh filtration fig 1 at ph higher than 6 0 the formation of the metals mn fe hydrolyses complex x oh increases and both x2 and x oh are adsorbed in complex forms existing as mnox and mnoxoh eqs 8 and 9 respectively 37 according to the similar mechanism ra2 is also expected to be absorbed on mno2 catalytic centres of manganese dioxide filter material fig 6 basically iron and oxygen are attracted to the manganese dioxide catalytic centres where they are retained long enough to react causing precipitation this material can also precipitate iron if there is no oxygen present in the water the reaction occurs when mno2 is reduced to mno and ferric hydroxide is precipitated eq 11 11 mno2 2fe hco3 2 h2o mno 2fe oh 3 4co2 h2o during the water backwashing the surface of this material is cleaned by removing the mno and mnoraoh in case of ra sorption this exposes fresh mno2 which is used to oxidize iron in order to restore the catalytic properties of manganese dioxide based filter material it is regenerated with kmno4 according to reaction eq 12 12 3 mno 2kmno4 h2o mno2 2koh 2mno2 12 increasing of the dose of kcl added step wised substantially improved 228ra removal fig 7 the regeneration of manganese dioxide based filter material with kcl was more effective than that with kmno4 however the dose of kcl needed was also substantially higher the observed removal of iron and manganese by kcl could be explained by desorption of iron and manganese from the filter material surface the mno2 catalytic centres of the filter material are restored by the ion exchange of potassium with the metal ion associated with oxide surface hydroxyl group eq 13 13 mnox 2 k mnok2 x2 chloride absorbs to the goethite and manganite particulates according to eqs 14 and 15 and subsequently removed during the water backwashing 14 feoox cl feooxcl 15 mnoox cl mnooxcl cleaning of the manganese dioxide based filter material surface from the radium sorbed iron and manganese particulates as well as from mnoraoh depended on the water backwashing operating conditions fig 8 the application of compressed air scouring simultaneously with the water backwashing the operating mode ii fig 4 improved cleaning of the filter material compared to that achieved by the water backwashing alone the backwash i fig 4 increased removal of iron up to 18 manganese up to 4 and 228ra up to 17 was observed without the changes in the water consumption 10 6 l per 400 g of fmh increasing of washwater inflow rate from 720 ml min the operating mode i fig 4 to 1020 ml min water consumption increased from 10 6 l to 13 6 l per 400 g of fmh without supplementary air scouring the backwash iii fig 4 resulted in a substantial improvement in the iron removal from 4 to 15 without substantial changes in the manganese from 2 to 4 and radium from 13 to 14 removal increased number of water backwashing cycles and introducing of air scouring prior to each water backwashing cycle in the backwash iv considerably improved the removal of manganese up to 8 and radium up to 22 however did not influence the efficiency of iron removal compared to that obtained by the backwash ii fig 4 air and water consumption in the backwash iv was the highest and comprised of 143 l and 17 3 l per 400 g of the filter material respectively the upward flow of water expands the bed producing a fluidized condition in which accumulated iron and manganese particulates desorbed from the particles as the backwash water is admitted to the bottom of the filter the bed begins to expand and there is an initial head loss iron and manganese particulates were allowed to escape as the bed expands further the rate of head loss decreases and when the whole bed is just suspended the head loss becomes constant the content of tsd fig 8 inset measured in the column effluent after each backwash did not change during twenty backwash cycles the backwash iv fig 4 thus increase in the backwash water inflow rate the backwash iii fig 4 or applying of air scouring the backwash ii fig 4 increases the expansion but not the head loss excessive expansion is not desirable since the particles will be forced further apart scouring action will be reduced and the backwash water consumption will be increased in the column experiments the chemical regeneration of manganese dioxide based filter material with kmno4 was supplemented with the water backwashing in combination with chemical regeneration water backwashing is a feasible way to improve the removal of iron and manganese particulates from the filter media water backwashing is also required for washing out of the chemical after the regeneration water backwashing using the similar operating regime to that applied at the viimsi wtp was able to remove radium sorbed iron and manganese particulates fig 9 addition of the chemical all at once or step wised with total kmno4 dose of 3 g kg did not substantially influence the iron and manganese particulates removal from the filter material and as a result the radium removal doubled dose of kmno4 applied in two steps allowed substantially improving the manganese removal with slight increase in the radium removal that can be explained by more effective cleaning the material surface from mno and mnoraoh in case of sorbed radium eq 12 the removal of radium was not substantially improved with the addition of both regenerating chemicals in moderate doses total doses were 750 g of kcl and 3 g of kmno4 per kg of the filter material indicating in no need for additional expenses for another chemical handling at least at present level of the contaminants accumulation similar results were obtained by the doubled kmno4 dose a 2 step addition of 3 g kmno4 indicating in no need for additional expenses for another chemical handling the regeneration of manganese dioxide based filter material fmh with both kcl and kmno4 chemicals did not reduce the filter material ability to remove iron manganese and radium table 2 indicating the tested chemicals safety for the restoring of the filter material functional properties 3 2 shaker and column experiments on zeolite regeneration the chemicals such as nacl and kcl were tested for a 24 h regeneration of the zeolite at the shaker the increase in the dose either of the chemicals increased the removal of 228ra fig 10 this effect was more profound for the zeolite treated with kcl according to the selectivity of zeolite related to cations it is more selective to potassium ion k than to sodium ion na this makes the regeneration with the kcl of a higher efficiency than that with the nacl after the contact of zeolite with the regenerating solution such as kcl exchange of k from the solution with exchangeable cation ra2 or nh4 from the zeolite z framework occurs eqs 16 and 17 16 z2ra 2k 2zk ra2 17 znh4 k zk nh4 in the experiments performed at the shaker a 2 step addition of kcl the dose of kcl and the regeneration time in each step were 250 g kg of zeolite and 24 h respectively and prolongation of the treatment time resulted in the 228ra removal increase from 71 obtained with the same total dose added all at once and treatment time of 24 h to 84 fig 10 the prolongation of the treatment time from 6 to 24 h and increase in the dose of the regenerating chemical from 65 to 195 g kcl kg were found to be effective for the zeolite treatment in the column experiments fig 11 step wised addition of the chemical did not result in 228ra removal improvement in spite of the zeolite water backwashing was not aimed at 228ra removal it is required to be applied to wash out the regenerating chemical kcl iron and manganese were not found in the backwash water in the zeolite filter media the concentrations were less that the method detection limit as they were removed from the treated water by the pre filtration through manganese dioxide based filter material bed fig 1 the concentration of nh4 in the backwash water varied from 1 to 10 7 mg l depending on the regenerating chemical addition mode single or step wise and dose for example the concentrations of nh4 in backwash water were 10 7 and 1 1 mg l at added all at once kcl doses of 195 g and 65 g per kg of zeolite respectively reduced treatment time of 6 h dose of kcl 195 g kg of zeolite decreased the removal of ammonium from zeolite resulting in the concentration of 1 1 mg nh4 l of washwater the reduction in the competitive compounds as iron and manganese load in the treated water during the manganese dioxide based material filtration treatment step supported the effective removal of ra2 and nh4 during the following filtration through the zeolite opposite to manganese dioxide based filter material where radium is mainly sorbed to manganese and iron particulates intended to be removed during the water backwashing zeolite exchanges its sodium ions for ra2 and nh4 in the water making therefore the chemical regeneration of the filtration material for the ions removal from the zeolite framework of necessity reduction in functionality of the regenerated zeolite was not observed in the material reuse experiment table 2 indicating in no loss of the filter material ability to remove ra2 and nh4 the parameters of the water passed through the regenerated filter material bed did not exceed potable water threshold limits and radiological parametric value of 0 1 msv year for indicative dose set in the estonian regulatory act 4 allowing for the material following reuse 3 3 pilot scale experiments on manganese dioxide based filter material fmh and zeolite regeneration the regeneration of the filter materials relies on the chemical reaction of the chemicals that certainly needs careful optimization of the doses reaction time and the reagents feeding manner to reactor before the technological transfer to a real scale in order to obtain safe and reliable drinking water quality carefully designed pilot scale study considerably simplifies the implementation of the process for a real scale application the water backwashing kmno4 regeneration a 2 step addition of kmno4 at the dose of 2 2 g kg of fmh water backwashing resulted in 63 of 228ra 84 of iron and 96 of manganese removal from the contaminated manganese dioxide based filter material in a pilot scale experiment table 3 the water backwashing kcl regeneration a 14 step addition of kcl at the dose of 53 6 g kg of zeolite total dose of 750 g kcl kg of zeolite water backwashing of a zeolite filter bed implemented as a final polishing step to remove the residual concentration of radium in treated water allowed removing 34 of 228ra table 3 the reduction in the functionality of the regenerated fmh and zeolite was not observed in the material reuse experiment table 2 indicating in no loss of the filter material ability to remove contaminants the parameters of the water such as iron manganese and ammonium passed through the regenerated manganese dioxide based and zeolite filter materials did not exceed potable water threshold limits table 2 set in the estonian regulatory act 4 and the complete removal of the radium was achieved this indicated that the regenerating chemicals did not have a negative effect on the material functional properties allowing for the materials following reuse in general large amount of radionuclides may be accumulated in the filter media backwashing and chemical regeneration at regular intervals however enable safe daily use of the filter materials radionuclides sorbed on manganese and iron particulates may be removed from the manganese dioxide based filter material particles and drained into the sewer the functional properties of the filter material are restored by the treatment with kmno4 solution in case of zeolite the ion exchange capacity of radium and nh4 contaminated material is restored by kcl and the worked out solution of regenerated chemical is rinsed out with water radioactive liquid wastes are produced when these filter materials are chemically regenerated or water backwashed thus in choosing a regeneration chemical and regeneration technology should also keep in mind the frequency of the chemical regeneration and the water backwashing as 228ra activity concentration in the effluent after the chemical regeneration of strongly contaminated manganese dioxide based filter material and zeolite table 3 reached up to 100 bq l and 2000 bq l respectively thus the higher the activity concentration of radionuclides and the daily water consumption the more often water backwashing and chemical regeneration should be carried out the regeneration interval should be frequent enough to prevent this technique from causing a problem of waste disposal according to recommendations of the finnish radiation and nuclear safety authority 8 if fe and mn removal methods are used and backwashing or regeneration is carried out about once a week the liquid be discharged into the sewer and after use the spent matrix be discharged into communal dumps thus the water backwashing chemical regeneration water backwashing at regular intervals results in the filter materials complete exhaustion delay by restoring their functionality and in the decrease of norm containing waste accumulation that contributes in a major way towards environmental protection 4 conclusions cleaning of the manganese dioxide based filter material fmh surface from the radium sorbed iron and manganese particulates as well as from mnoraoh formed as result of mno2 reduction to mno accompanied by the radium sorption depended on the backwash water flow compressed air scouring prior to or at the same time as water backwashing improved cleaning and reduced backwash water consumption increased dose of kmno4 added step wised also allowed substantially improving the manganese removal with slight increase in radium removal the addition of kmno4 restored the catalytic properties of the filter material by converting of the reduced mno to mno2 increase in the dose either of the nacl or kcl regenerating chemicals and the prolongation of the treatment time improved the removal of 228ra from the zeolite framework by the ion exchange the effect was more profound for the zeolite treated with kcl due to stronger cation exchange selectivity of k over na in spite of the water backwashing did not influence 288ra removal it is required to be applied to wash out the regenerating chemical kcl the reduction in the functionality of the regenerated manganese dioxide based and zeolite filter materials was not observed during the following reuse the parameters of water passed through the decontaminated filter media satisfied the threshold limits set for drinking water quality by the estonian and european

ch3cooh were obtained from ranbaxy fine chemicals limited new delhi india 2 2 preparation of synthetic solution and sample analysis stock solution of ba 1000 mg l and tpa 1000 mg l with distilled water was synthetically prepared entire reagents as well as samples were preserved at 4 c to avoid microorganism s growth and biodegradation based on previous studies 21 37 39 working concentration of

voltage current amp time hour and solution volume liter respectively 3 experimental setup and procedure initially acid precipitation was carried out by mixing of h2so4 1 n to the solution at different temperatures 15 60 c and ph 2 5 then the solution was allowed to settle for 4 h after that the supernatant was filtered and retreated by electrochemical processes both electrochemical experiments eo and ef were done in a rectangular plexiglas batch cell of 1 6 l capacity plain graphite plates 100 mm 80 mm 3 mm were used as anode and cathode to treat 1 l of solution during eo and ef treatments the effective electrode area into the solution was 131 2 cm2 distance between parallel electrodes was set at 4 cm fig 1 shows the schematic diagram of electrochemical setup direct current 0 4 a and voltage 0 35 v were used during electrochemical treatments the supply mode of electric current was continuous for each individual run after each and every experimental run electrodes were cleaned and washed by hcl solution 15 v v and water respectively both electrochemical experiments were performed at room temperature 25 2 c and atmospheric pressure in ef treatment prior to electrolysis air was bubbled continuously through fish aerator to saturate the solution with oxygen o2 till the end of experiments this dissolved oxygen leads to in situ generation of h2o2 at the surface of cathode as in eq 8 a different concentration of ferrous ions was added during ef process to determine the range of operating parameters during electrochemical treatment some random experimental runs were conducted tables 2 and 3 show operating parameters ranges for eo and ef processes respectively both eo and ef experiments were conducted at operating conditions predicted by ccd as shown in tables 4 and 5 respectively 4 results and discussion 4 1 effect of acid precipitation on removal of ba tpa and cod ba and tpa present in the ionized state in aqueous solution as the pk a value for tpa are 3 51 and 4 82 and for ba it is 4 2 the initial ph pho 6 9 of solution was decreased by the addition of 1 n h2so4 then tpa and ba get deionized hydrogen ions concentration also increases by lowering the ph of solution through which is responsible for the conversion of dissociated weak acid ions to undissociated acid molecules and finally due to common ion hydrogen ions effect ionic product values of tpa and ba surpass its solubility product value resulting precipitation 46 acids tpa and ba present in the wastewater facilitate agglomeration by reduction in ph and then settling is allowed for 4 h after that the supernatant was filtered and used for further treatment precipitation of tpa and ba in the aqueous solution results concentration reduction of ba tpa and cod in solution approximately 48 7 83 4 and 57 respectively at temperature 15 c and ph 2 effect of temperature and ph were also studied as shown in fig 2 a c the new concentrations in supernatant are found ba 205 2 mg l tpa 66 4 mg l and cod 524 6 mg l the supernatant was re treated by of eo and ef processes separately 4 2 effect of ph on removal of ba tpa cod and e consumption effect of ph on percent removal of ba tpa cod and e consumption is shown in figs 3a c e g and 4a c e g by eo and ef methods respectively ph is an important tool to influence the performance of eo and ef processes both eo and ef treatments were completed according to the ccd predicted sets as given in tables 1 and 2 during electrochemical treatment acidic medium favors generation of hydroxide radicals oh in eo formation of hypochlorous acid hocl also takes place in the aqueous solution at low ph hocl is a dominant chlorine compound having high oxidation potential favors high removal with low energy consumption 11 ocl h2o hocl oh at neutral ph formation of chlorate and perchlorate takes place by the oxidation of free chlorines as well as through combination of hocl and hypochlorite which is undesirable in eo process resulting lower removal efficiencies with higher energy consumption at high ph removal occurs due to less potent hypochlorite ions 23 47 it is clearly shown in fig 3a c and e that removal efficiencies of ba tpa and cod were increased with ph and beyond optimum ph i e 4 6 removal decreased in ef process air was bubbled continuously through the fish aerator before electrolysis to saturate the solution with oxygen that leads to in situ generation of h2o2 and enhances hydroxyl radical oh formation at acidic ph resulting higher removal at very low ph generation of oxonium ions h3o2 occur 48 and at very high ph decomposition of h2o2 into water and oxygen take place resulting lower removal in fig 4a c e and g it is shown that removal of ba tpa and cod increased and e consumption decreased with ph and beyond optimum ph i e 3 1 removals were decreased with high e consumption 4 3 effect of current density and electrolysis time on removal of ba tpa cod and e consumption effects of current density and time on removal of ba tpa cod and e consumption are shown in figs 3a h and 4a h by eo and ef processes respectively current density and electrolysis plays vital role during electrochemical treatment current densities 30 48 91 44 a m2 and electrolysis time 10 90 min were studied during electrolysis rate of generation of electrons and hydroxyl radicals increases with current density and time during electrochemical reactions resulting higher removal it was found that after a while efficiencies decrease due to presence of excess amount of h2o2 leading to the scavenging effect on oh radicals 23 49 50 12 h2o2 oh ho2 h2o beyond optimum values cd 65 15 a m2 t 58 02 min for eo and 54 39 a m2 and 50 11 min for ef percent removal decreases and e consumption increases due to low generation of metal ions and oh radicals as well as due to consumption of considerable amount of charges during electrolysis through some side reactions very high current density causes temperature rise of electrolytic solution and enhancement in e consumption 51 52 4 4 effect of electrolyte and fe2 concentration on removal of ba tpa cod and e consumption effect of supporting electrolyte is an important parameter in electrochemical process it is basically used for the enhancement of conductivity and electron transfer rate during electrolysis in eo process nacl with different concentrations 0 5 1 5 g l was used as supporting electrolyte and obtained an optimum value 1 g l it was observed that removals were higher and e consumption was lower at this optimum value during eo treatment as shown in fig 3b d e and h this optimum value for electrolyte 1 g l was also used during ef treatment fe2 ions concentration plays a big role in ef process during ef treatment fe2 ions accelerates hydroxyl radicals oh generation the main oxidizing agent and responsible for high removal as shown in eq 7 53 however excess amount of fe2 ions causes oh consumption during treatment resulting lower removal 54 it can be clearly seen in fig 4b d f and h that initially removal increases and e consumption decreases with fe2 concentration and beyond optimum value i e 1 mmol l removal starts to decrease with higher e consumption 5 rsm study 5 1 optimization both eo and ef techniques were optimized to get maximum removal and minimum e consumption operating conditions for both the processes with their experimental and ccd results are given in tables 4 and 5 optimum operating conditions was reconfirmed by performing experimental runs and obtained the optimized results as shown in table 6 the model shows good adequacy due to closeness of ccd predicted values and experimental run results 5 2 anova analysis 5 2 1 coefficient of regression r 2 predicted r 2 adjusted r 2 and adequacy of precision r 2 is an important tool to check adequacy of the model for a good fitting model r 2 should be greater than 0 80 55 in this study r 2 values for removal of ba 0 93 eo 0 96 ef tpa 0 89 eo 0 92 ef cod 0 90 eo 0 91 ef and for e consumption 0 96 eo 0 97 ef as given in table 7 indicate that good adequacy of the model predicted r 2 value measures variation in the model predicted data high adjusted r 2 value shows the highly significant model and adequacy of precision indicates signal to noise ratio which should be greater than 4 56 57 values of predicted r 2 adjusted r 2 and adequacy of precision are shown in table 7 5 2 2 press predicted residual error sum of squares cv coefficient of variation f value and p value press is sum of the squared differences of estimated and actual values over all points that measures fitting quality of model at each point for a good model press value should be less in this study press values for removal of ba tpa cod and e consumption are not so high which shows a good model cv values indicate about variation in actual and model predicted values and it should not more than 10 f value tells about distribution of actual data around the fitted model and p value explains significance of model terms lower values of f and p values are desirable for a good model p value less than 0 05 indicate the significant model and greater than 0 1000 shows insignificant model term 58 values of press cv f values and p values are given in table 7 5 2 3 model equations based on anova analysis second order polynomial equations in terms of independent

beyond optimum ph i e 3 1 removals were decreased with high e consumption 4 3 effect of current density and electrolysis time on removal of ba tpa cod and e consumption effects of current density and time on removal of ba tpa cod and e consumption are shown in figs 3a h and 4a h by eo and ef processes respectively current density and electrolysis plays vital role during electrochemical treatment current densities 30 48 91 44 a m2 and electrolysis time 10 90 min were studied during electrolysis rate of generation of electrons and hydroxyl radicals increases with current density and time during electrochemical reactions resulting higher removal it was found that after a while efficiencies decrease due to presence of excess amount of h2o2 leading to the scavenging effect on oh radicals 23 49 50 12 h2o2 oh ho2 h2o beyond optimum values cd 65 15 a m2 t 58 02 min for eo and 54 39 a m2 and 50 11 min for ef percent removal decreases and e consumption increases due to low generation of metal ions and oh radicals as well as due to consumption of considerable amount of charges during electrolysis through some side reactions very high current density causes temperature rise of electrolytic solution and enhancement in e consumption 51 52 4 4 effect of electrolyte and fe2 concentration on removal of ba tpa cod and e consumption effect of supporting electrolyte is an important parameter in electrochemical process it is basically used for the enhancement of conductivity and electron transfer rate during electrolysis in eo process nacl with different concentrations 0 5 1 5 g l was used as supporting electrolyte and obtained an optimum value 1 g l it was observed that removals were higher and e consumption was lower at this optimum value during eo treatment as shown in fig 3b d e and h this optimum value for electrolyte 1 g l was also used during ef treatment fe2 ions concentration plays a big role in ef process during ef treatment fe2 ions accelerates hydroxyl radicals oh generation the main oxidizing agent and responsible for high removal as shown in eq 7 53 however excess amount of fe2 ions causes oh consumption during treatment resulting lower removal 54 it can be clearly seen in fig 4b d f and h that initially removal increases and e consumption decreases with fe2 concentration and beyond optimum value i e 1 mmol l removal starts to decrease with higher e consumption 5 rsm study 5 1 optimization both eo and ef techniques were optimized to get maximum removal and minimum e consumption operating conditions for both the processes with their experimental and ccd results are given in tables 4 and 5 optimum operating conditions was reconfirmed by performing experimental runs and obtained the optimized results as shown in table 6 the model shows good adequacy due to closeness of ccd predicted values and experimental run results 5 2 anova analysis 5 2 1 coefficient of regression r 2 predicted r 2 adjusted r 2 and adequacy of precision r 2 is an important tool to check adequacy of the model for a good fitting model r 2 should be greater than 0 80 55 in this study r 2 values for removal of ba 0 93 eo 0 96 ef tpa 0 89 eo 0 92 ef cod 0 90 eo 0 91 ef and for e consumption 0 96 eo 0 97 ef as given in table 7 indicate that good adequacy of the model predicted r 2 value measures variation in the model predicted data high adjusted r 2 value shows the highly significant model and adequacy of precision indicates signal to noise ratio which should be greater than 4 56 57 values of predicted r 2 adjusted r 2 and adequacy of precision are shown in table 7 5 2 2 press predicted residual error sum of squares cv coefficient of variation f value and p value press is sum of the squared differences of estimated and actual values over all points that measures fitting quality of model at each point for a good model press value should be less in this study press values for removal of ba tpa cod and e consumption are not so high which shows a good model cv values indicate about variation in actual and model predicted values and it should not more than 10 f value tells about distribution of actual data around the fitted model and p value explains significance of model terms lower values of f and p values are desirable for a good model p value less than 0 05 indicate the significant model and greater than 0 1000 shows insignificant model term 58 values of press cv f values and p values are given in table 7 5 2 3 model equations based on anova analysis second order polynomial equations in terms of independent

14384,due to the high conductivity and chromium toxicity of tannery effluents wastewater reuse can be possible only by implementing integrated process of sustainable wastewater treatments the objective of the present study was to evaluate the suitability of treated tannery effluent for vegetable growth an integrated treatment technology hydrolysis anaerobic sequence batch reactor sbr integrated with a constructed wetland was used to treat tannery wastewater randomized block design for field and pot experiment was used for vegetable growth treated effluent soil and vegetable samples were analyzed for nutrient physicochemical cr and microbial parameters using standard methods apha the removal efficiency of the innovative integrated treatment system ranges from 82 to 99 9 the treated effluent concentrations for bod cod tn no3 n and nh3 n were 56 18 170 26 50 13 22 75 20 and 7 1 6 mg l respectively similarly the concentration of ec s2 so4 2 and cl were 2 23 0 17 ms cm 0 4 0 4 88 42 and 450 150 mg l respectively with a 99 9 tcf removal the effluent meets the permissible discharge limits possibly reuse for irrigation cr was found to accumulate the most in all vegetable samples and significantly higher in the field than pot treatments cr cd pb and ni concentrations in all the pot experiment were found below the fao who guidelines the target hazard quotients thqs estimation suggests that cr concentration in all the pot treatment vegetable has no potential health risk keywords tannery wastewater treatment irrigation vegetables heavy metals health risk 1 introduction during the past decades increased per capita use and high water demands in agro processing industrial sectors put pressure on fresh water resources discharge of untreated wastewater into the water bodies not only poses ecological and health risks but also worsen the current situation of water demand for agriculture 44 leather tanning and leather product industries in ethiopia contributes 5 9 of the total export earnings for the years 2010 11 40 and is significantly contributing towards employment generation 35 however tannery industry wastewater is ranked as the highest pollutant among all the industrial wastewaters due to the presences of chromium sulfide and organic compounds which produce highest toxic intensity per unit of output 11 21 38 cause environmental and health problems due to the scarcity of fresh water in developing countries wastewater is being used to irrigate land and provides high productivity which enables them to sow all year round vegetables 30 24 it also reduces fertilizer usage due to its high micro nutrients and organic matter content 9 27 around 10 of the total irrigated lands worldwide were used the wastewater for irrigation 43 however the use of tannery wastewater for irrigation contaminates the soil vegetables and crops which when consumed can cause serious health hazards to the consumer 44 43 26 heavy metal contaminants are among the major risk factors due to its non biodegradability long biological half life and bioaccumulation in living organisms leading to unwanted effects 28 37 there is a gradual increase in consumption of vegetables in urban communities due to increasing awareness of vegetable food values and a higher standard of living 1 however due to the use of contaminated wastewater vegetables and fruits accumulate toxic heavy metals due to its persistent nature and bio accumulation in human organs they are potential carcinogens or toxic 28 therefore these pollutants must be removed from the effluent before using it for irrigation or discharging into the environment in view of the increasing use of industrial wastewater for irrigation as well as consumption of contaminated vegetables and fruits there is a need to treat the wastewater and analyze the vegetables irrigated with wastewater to ensure that these pollutants both in the effluent and vegetables meet the acceptable international requirements adequate treatment of wastewater can provide an effluent of sufficient quality that should be put to beneficial use and not wasted reuse of marginal water quality like industrial effluent in agriculture for irrigating cropland becomes a lucrative option 8 where good quality water availability is limited in the present study integrated treatment system anaerobic reactor sequence batch reactor sbr integrated with constructed wetland was used to treat tannery wastewater therefore the objective of the present study is to evaluate the suitability of treated tannery wastewater effluent for safe reuse for irrigation of vegetables with a particular emphasis on the detection of chromium from irrigated vegetables it is one of the first focused investigations in the country into the reuse of tannery wastewater for food crop vegetables irrigation which may become a vital strategy for value addition and keep effluent receiving water bodies 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and pilot scale treatment system the study was conducted on a pilot scale integrated biological wastewater treatment plant wwtp which was installed in the premises of a privately owned tannery industry in modjo town 70 km south of addis ababa ethiopia the wwtp has a capacity of treating 50m3 tannery ww per day fig 1 a it consists of primary screening and grit removal chamber sedimentation tanks hydrolysis tank 50 m3 an aerobic anoxic sequence batch reactor sbr 60 m3 collection tank followed by three series connected subsurface flow ssf constructed wetland cws fig

h cycle i e 40 min fill 22 h reacts 6 h aeration and 6 h mix the volumetric loading rate was 27 69 m3 which is 2 3 of the total working volume of the reactor sbr effluent was collected in the collection tank and fed to the cw hssf cw has three cells with a total effective volume of 70 875 m3 30 m width 15 m and depth of 0 6 m the cws are filled with medium sized gravel size 6 20 mm and vegetated with phragmites karka the wastewater flow rates into the cws were 23 625 m3 d and operated for 3 days hrt 39 the effluent at the end of cw was collected and used to irrigate vegetables at modjo tannery premises fig 1c 2 2 experimental design suitability assessment of treated tannery ww for irrigation of vegetable experiment was carried out both in pot and field experiment completely randomized block design crbd with a total of 36 treatment plots both the pot and field experiments were irrigated with treated tannery ww treatments and underground water controls each in triplicates each block has an area of one meter square plots the pots and field plots were seeded with seeds of vegetables table 1 2 3 collection and analysis of sample samples of vegetables soil wastewater and treated effluents were collected from mojo tannery premises prepared and preserved in the laboratory until analysis was done a liter of effluents was collected at the end of cw using cleaned plastic bottles every 3 day of hydraulic retention time hrt effluents were characterized for total coliforms tcf fecal coliforms fcf bod cod tn nutrients no3 n po4 s2 and so4 2 ph tds conductivity chlorides

4 bio transferable factor btf the bioavailability of a metal at a particular position on a species of plant is calculated as the ratio between the concentration of heavy metals in the edible parts of vegetables to that of the corresponding soil all based on dry weight for each vegetable separately 7 13 22 23 36 b t f c oncentration of heavy metals in edible parts concentration of heavy metal in soil 2 5 estimation of target hazard quotients thqs health risks associated with heavy metals cr and cd were assessed based on the target hazard quotients thqs 10 41 a target hazard quotient thqs for

vegetable samples were statistically analyzed using the statistical software spss 16 0 spss usa origion8 and microsoft excel 3 result and discussion 3 1 performance of integrated treatment system as shown in table 2 below the modjo tannery industry generates a strong wastewater with a high organic loading rate of organic pollutants and nutrients supported by khan 21 during the study period the average inflow values of raw wastewater were bod 3 120 6 172 mg l cod 7273 536 97 mg l total nitrogen tn 545 12 mg l ammonia nitrogen nh3 n 261 5 68 mg l nitrate nitrogen no3 n 112 2 24 mg l sulfate so4 2 488 7 170 mg l and sulfide s2 268 5 6 mg l table 2 similarly the mean influent concentration of ec and cr were 15 5 1 99 ms cm 28 47 5 37 mg l respectively with a ph of 8 63 3 56 the removal efficiency of a pilot biological treatment system integrated with cw in the removal of priority pollutants of tannery wastewater was high ranges between 81 and 99 9 supported by tadesse et al 39 the final effluent concentration of organic and inorganic parameters namely cod tn so4 2 s2 no3 n nh4 n and total cr were below the ethiopia epa discharge limit values table 2 fig 2 b c set for tannery effluents 13 in this study the average overall removal efficiencies of integrated treatment system were 96 6 for cod 98 78 for tss 90 4 for tn 97 for nh3 n 95 98 for no3 n 81 8 for so4 2 99 for s2 and 95 9 for total cr fig 2a these results showed that the pollutant removal potential of the integrated treatment system was found to be very high demonstrating that the biological system significantly treats high strength tannery waste water when considering the relative treatment efficiency of the individual components that make up the system the constructed wetland performed the highest removal efficiencies of all the selected parameters ranging from 79 7 95 removal 39 similarly a 93 5 cod reduction and a 96 9 bod reduction were obtained from tannery ww an inlet cod concentration of 2725 9 mg l and 1899 5 mg l of bod by using synthesized mgo nanopowders in the fixed bed system 29 3 2 characterization of influent and treated effluent the mean concentration of biologically treated effluent fed into the cw was higher bod cod tn no3 and nh3 n values with 812 96 1142 178 218 17 86 144 35 and 40 66 21 82 mg l respectively for a 3 day hrt similarly the mean concentrations of salinity and chloride were 7 5 1 25 mg l and 765 132 mg l respectively the anaerobic sbr treated tannery effluent concentrations were above the permissible discharge limits to achieve higher effluent quality post treatment of anaerobic sbr treated tannery effluent is required therefore the anaerobic sbr effluent was then further treated by the connected cw the final effluent concentration for bod and cod were 56 18 and 170 26 mg l with removal efficiencies of 98 4 and 96 6 respectively the average concentrations of tn no3 n and nh3 n in the final effluent were 50 13 mg l 22 7 20 mg l and 17 1 6 75 mg l respectively the concentrations of s 2 and so4 2 in the effluent were 0 4 0 44 and 88 42 mg l with a removal efficiency of 99 8 and 81 8 respectively fig 2a the values of ph cod tn s2 so4 2 and chloride were within the acceptable national provisional discharge limit fig 2b c similarly the tcf lab analysis of the effluent showed a 99 9 removal and fecal coliform was not detected in the effluent this showed that the treated effluent quality was below the ethiopian epa discharge limit guideline for tannery effluent fig 2b c and hence the treated effluent can be used for irrigation for vegetable production 3 3 effects of treated tannery effluent on vegetable growth the average shoot length in the treatment vegetables except cabbage was slightly less than the average shoot length of the control fig 3 a however except the onion there was no significant statistical difference in shoot length between the control and treatments at p 0 05 results also showed that the inhibition of treated tannery effluent on carrot tomato cabbage onion swiss chard and root beet was 0 7 3 0 36 15 4 2 and 2 3 respectively the treated tannery effluent showed a significant inhibition effect at p 0 05 only for onion shoot growth fig 3b the treated tannery effluent imposed an inhibitory effect on both shoot growth of onion 15 while stimulates shoot growth in cabbage 0 36 inhibition a study done by asfaw et al 6 using 50 diluted tannery effluent showed that there was a significant negative effect on the growth of treatment vegetable 3 4 heavy metal accumulation in vegetables vegetable analysis showed that cr and cd have detectable concentrations in the analyzed sample while pb and ni were found below the minimum detection limit of flame aas 0 005 mg l the heavy metal concentrations in effluent samples were decreased in the order of cr cd pb and ni in the field experiment the mean total cr values mg kg in the edible portion of vegetables were in the following order tomato 0 197 0 005 carrot 0 122 0 002 cabbage 0 113 0 004 onion 0 098 0 002 swiss chard 0 088 0 001 beet root 0 05 0 001 fig 4 a the significant differences in cr concentrations among the different vegetables implied that each species had different abilities and capacities to take up and accumulate heavy metals table 3 which were supported by islam and hoque 19 the concentration of cd in edible portions of vegetables in all treatments was below permissible limits meanwhile no differences in cd values were observed between vegetables p 0 05 all the analyzed vegetable samples of the field treatments contained detectable concentrations of total cr and cd but in the pot experiment only cr was detected in the tomato 0 016 mg l cabbage 0 009 mg kg carrot 0 007 mg kg and swiss chard 0 006 mg kg table 3 the electrical conductivity in the final effluent was recorded lower than the standard limits which indicates the presence of a relatively low concentration of salts in the effluent and can be used for irrigation of vegetables however due to the accumulation of salts subsequent irrigation might buildup salinity in the soil 17 33 irrigation with tannery wastewater supposed to be significantly reduced vegetable growth due to high levels of chromium both in the contaminated soil and effluent 5 both form trivalent cr iii and hexavalent cr vi chromium are toxic to plants and inhibit germination reduce growth generate oxidative stress decrease protein content inhibit photosynthesis and alter enzyme activities in the exposed plants 31 36 however in the current study cr vi was not detected in the treated effluent sangeetha et al 34 also reported that the use of undiluted tannery effluents for irrigation can deteriorate the nutritional quality of plants nevertheless treated effluent improves plant yield due to its metals and organic components and may be beneficial if present in acceptable limits in this study due to the integration of treatment systems the treated effluents have lower cr and nutrient concentration this improves the growth of cabbage with minimal effect on swiss chard tomato and beetroot shoot growth but no effects on the carrot was observed table 3 the toxic effect of heavy metal on plant growth depends on the amount of heavy metal up taken from the specified environment pot and field experiment results with different cr soil content revealed that cr in the vegetables was mainly translocated from the soil to the vegetable this can also be shown by the low level of cr in the pot treatments vegetables where the soil before the experiment has no detectable cr concentration 0 005 mg kg according to fao 14 15 the maximum allowable concentration of cr and cd were 0 1 and 0 2 mg kg 1 respectively for leafy vegetables about 50 of the treatment vegetables from field samples were above the who fao standards for cr however the cd concentrations observed in all vegetable samples were below who fao guidelines the range of cr concentrations 0 05 0 197 mg kg 1 and cd 0 001 0 023 mg kg in edible portions of vegetables was less than the values found in rattan et al 33 irrigating industrial effluent contaminated river vegetables which are grown on akaki river also could have a considerably high level of cr cd ni pb and zn fissha 16 he reported that cr levels in vegetables varying from 1 25 to 2 81 mg kg in cabbage onion potato red beet and swiss chard which was almost ten times higher than those in the present study thus treated tannery wastewater irrigation was safer than using polluted rivers 3 16 12 soil analysis before and after the experiment showed that the tannery effluent 0 73 mg cr per liter irrigated soil showed an increase in its average cr concentration from 0 129 to 0 166 mg kg in four month intervals in the field experiment the mean total cr value in the treatment soils from the field experiment 0 166 mg kg was higher than the mean value of pot experiment 0 029 mg kg as shown in fig 4b the soil used for field vegetable growth was previously contaminated with cr in addition considerable amounts of heavy metals were found in soil irrigated with wastewater as compared with control soil irrigated with groundwater therefore irrigation with tannery effluent was believed to be responsible for soil enrichment with cr however the magnitude of cr in soils irrigated with tannery effluent was below the maximum permissible limit 3 mg kg as indicated by kabata pendias and pendias 20 3 5 bio transferable factor the bio transferable factor for cr in the field experiment was in the order of tomato 1 23 carrot 0 75 cabbage and 0 71 onion 0 62 swiss chard 0 0 46 beet root 0 31 and in pot experiment tomato 0 53 cabbage 0 29 beet root 0 026 fig 5 the result showed that the field experimental group has the highest bio transferable factor for all vegetables than the pot experiment indicating that the primary source of cr in the vegetable was previously the contaminated soil metal transfer factors from soil to vegetables were less significant for cr than zn mn cu fe and cd 32 this may be one factor for the low cr concentration in treatment vegetables 3 6 potential health risk estimation health risks associated with these heavy metals cr and cd through vegetable consumption were assessed based on the target hazard quotients thqs thqs include not only the intake of metals but also the exposure frequency and duration body weight and the oral reference dose oral reference doses ofd were taken 0 003 and 0 005 mg kg per day for cr and cd respectively 19 42 thq is the ratio between measured concentration and rfd weighted by the length and frequency of exposure amount ingested and body weight the thq 1 means the exposed population is assumed to be safe and 1 thq 5 means the exposed population is in the level of concern interval it must be noted that thq is not a measure of risk but indicates a level of concern 18 in this study the potential of health risk assessment was done based on who assessment of vegetable and fruit consumption in ethiopia the average amount of vegetable consumption in ethiopia is 25 4 kg person year 25 which is much less than the who fao recommended intake 86 kg per capita per year the results showed that cd pb and ni contamination in plants had the lowest potential to pose a health risk to the consumers normally chromium is known to have a health effect above 0 1 mg kg vegetables 2 15 however based on the amount of vegetable consumption the target hazard quotients thqs for cr were less than 1 0 073 in all the vegetables although fruits tomato have higher concentrations of cr than other vegetables the target hazard quotients thqs are lower 0 073 and the exposed population was assumed to be safe thus in this study the potential health risks posed by cr from treated tannery effluent were considered negligible based on the results of thqs a similar study by cui et al 12 has also reported that local residents of an area near modjo river have been exposed to cr through consumption of vegetables but no risk was found the study proved that the treated tannery effluent is suitable for irrigation of vegetables 4 conclusion the results show that the technical performance of the pilot integrated treatment system was efficient to treat high strength tannery wastewater and the treated effluent meets the acceptable minimum national and international discharge standards the treated tannery wastewater has a potential for reuse for irrigation vegetable analysis showed that cr concentration in field treatment vegetables such as tomato cabbage and carrot were slightly above the who fao heavy metal standards a higher heavy metal cr and cd concentration in a field experiment compared to pot experiment reflects that the major source of cr in the vegetables was the soil uptake capabilities and their further translocation from the soil to the edible portion of the vegetables was also another factor in vegetable heavy metal accumulation the study proved that the integrated treatment technology can turn tannery wastewater into value added products such as clean water possibly used for irrigation acknowledgements

samples and significantly higher in the field than pot treatments cr cd pb and ni concentrations in all the pot experiment were found below the fao who guidelines the target hazard quotients thqs estimation suggests that cr concentration in all the pot treatment vegetable has no potential health risk keywords tannery wastewater treatment irrigation vegetables heavy metals health risk 1

health problems due to the scarcity of fresh water in developing countries wastewater is being used to irrigate land and provides high productivity which enables them to sow all year round vegetables 30 24 it also reduces fertilizer usage due to its high micro nutrients and organic matter content 9 27 around 10 of the total irrigated lands worldwide were used the wastewater for irrigation 43 however the use of tannery wastewater for irrigation contaminates the soil vegetables and crops which when consumed can cause serious health hazards to the consumer 44 43 26 heavy metal contaminants are among the major risk factors due to its non biodegradability long biological half life and bioaccumulation in living organisms leading to unwanted effects 28 37 there is a gradual increase in consumption of vegetables in urban communities due to increasing awareness of vegetable food values and a higher standard of living 1 however due to the use of contaminated wastewater vegetables and fruits accumulate toxic heavy metals due to its persistent nature and bio accumulation in human organs they are potential carcinogens or toxic 28 therefore these pollutants must be removed from the effluent before using it for irrigation or discharging into the environment in view of the increasing use of industrial wastewater for irrigation as well as consumption of contaminated vegetables and fruits there is a need to treat the wastewater and analyze the vegetables irrigated with wastewater to ensure that these pollutants both in the effluent and vegetables meet the acceptable international requirements adequate treatment of wastewater can provide an effluent of sufficient quality that should be put to beneficial use and not wasted reuse of marginal water quality like industrial effluent in agriculture for irrigating cropland becomes a lucrative option 8 where good quality water availability is limited in the present study integrated treatment system anaerobic reactor sequence batch reactor sbr integrated with constructed wetland was used to treat tannery wastewater therefore the objective of the present study is to evaluate the suitability of treated tannery wastewater effluent for safe reuse for irrigation of vegetables with a particular emphasis on the detection of chromium from irrigated vegetables it is one of the first focused investigations in the country into the reuse of tannery wastewater for food crop vegetables irrigation which may become a vital strategy for value addition and keep effluent receiving water bodies 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and pilot scale treatment system the study was conducted on a pilot scale integrated biological wastewater treatment plant wwtp which was installed in the premises of a privately owned tannery industry in modjo town 70 km south of addis ababa ethiopia the wwtp has a capacity of treating 50m3 tannery ww per day fig 1 a it consists of primary screening and grit removal chamber sedimentation tanks hydrolysis tank 50 m3 an aerobic anoxic sequence batch reactor sbr 60 m3 collection tank followed by three series connected subsurface flow ssf constructed wetland cws fig

h cycle i e 40 min fill 22 h reacts 6 h aeration and 6 h mix the volumetric loading rate was 27 69 m3 which is 2 3 of the total working volume of the reactor sbr effluent was collected in the collection tank and fed to the cw hssf cw has three cells with a total effective volume of 70 875 m3 30 m width 15 m and depth of 0 6 m the cws are filled with medium sized gravel size 6 20 mm and vegetated with phragmites karka the wastewater flow rates into the cws were 23 625 m3 d and operated for 3 days hrt 39 the effluent at the end of cw was collected and used to irrigate vegetables at modjo tannery premises fig 1c 2 2 experimental design suitability assessment of treated tannery ww for irrigation of vegetable experiment was carried out both in pot and field experiment completely randomized block design crbd with a total of 36 treatment plots both the pot and field experiments were irrigated with treated tannery ww treatments and underground water controls each in triplicates each block has an area of one meter square plots the pots and field plots were seeded with seeds of vegetables table 1 2 3 collection and analysis of sample samples of vegetables soil wastewater and treated effluents were collected from mojo tannery premises prepared and preserved in the laboratory until analysis was done a liter of effluents was collected at the end of cw using cleaned plastic

vegetable samples were statistically analyzed using the statistical software spss 16 0 spss usa origion8 and microsoft excel 3 result and discussion 3 1 performance of integrated treatment system as shown in table 2 below the modjo tannery industry generates a strong wastewater with a high organic loading rate of organic pollutants and nutrients supported by khan 21 during the study period the average inflow values of raw wastewater were bod 3 120 6 172 mg l cod 7273 536 97 mg l total nitrogen tn 545 12 mg l ammonia nitrogen nh3 n 261 5 68 mg l nitrate nitrogen no3 n 112 2 24 mg l sulfate so4 2 488 7 170 mg l and sulfide s2 268 5 6 mg l table 2 similarly the mean influent concentration of ec and cr were 15 5 1 99 ms cm 28 47 5 37 mg l respectively with a ph of 8 63 3 56 the removal efficiency of a pilot biological treatment system integrated with cw in the removal of priority pollutants of tannery wastewater was high ranges between 81 and 99 9 supported by tadesse et al 39 the final effluent concentration of organic and inorganic parameters namely cod tn so4 2 s2 no3 n nh4 n and total cr were below the ethiopia epa discharge limit values table 2 fig 2 b c set for tannery effluents 13 in this study the average overall removal efficiencies of integrated treatment system were 96 6 for cod 98 78 for tss 90 4 for tn 97 for nh3 n 95 98 for no3 n 81 8 for so4 2 99 for s2 and 95 9 for total cr fig 2a these results showed that the pollutant removal potential of the integrated treatment system was found to be very high demonstrating that the biological system significantly treats high strength tannery waste water when considering the relative treatment efficiency of the individual components that make up the system the constructed wetland performed the highest removal efficiencies of all the selected parameters ranging from 79 7 95 removal 39 similarly a 93 5 cod reduction and a 96 9 bod reduction were obtained from tannery ww an inlet cod concentration of 2725 9 mg l and 1899 5 mg l of bod by using synthesized mgo nanopowders in the fixed bed system 29 3 2 characterization of influent and treated effluent the mean concentration of biologically treated effluent fed into the cw was higher bod cod tn no3 and nh3 n values with 812 96 1142 178 218 17 86 144 35 and 40 66 21 82 mg l respectively for a 3 day hrt similarly the mean concentrations of salinity and chloride were 7 5 1 25 mg l and 765 132 mg l respectively the anaerobic sbr treated tannery effluent concentrations were above the permissible discharge limits to achieve higher effluent quality post treatment of anaerobic sbr treated tannery effluent is required therefore the anaerobic sbr effluent was then further treated by the connected cw the final effluent concentration for bod and cod were 56 18 and 170 26 mg l with removal efficiencies of 98 4 and 96 6 respectively the average concentrations of tn no3 n and nh3 n in the final effluent were 50 13 mg l 22 7 20 mg l and 17 1 6 75 mg l respectively the concentrations of s 2 and so4 2 in the effluent were 0 4 0 44 and 88 42 mg l with a removal efficiency of 99 8 and 81 8 respectively fig 2a the values of ph cod tn s2 so4 2 and chloride were within the acceptable national provisional discharge limit fig 2b c similarly the tcf lab analysis of the effluent showed a 99 9 removal and fecal coliform was not detected in the effluent this showed that the treated effluent quality was below the ethiopian epa discharge limit guideline for tannery effluent fig 2b c and hence the treated effluent can be used for irrigation for vegetable production 3 3 effects of treated tannery effluent on vegetable growth the average shoot length in the treatment vegetables except cabbage was slightly less than the average shoot length of the control fig 3 a however except the onion there was no significant statistical difference in shoot length between the control and treatments at p 0 05 results also showed that the inhibition of treated tannery effluent on carrot tomato cabbage onion swiss chard and root beet was 0 7 3 0 36 15 4 2 and 2 3 respectively the treated tannery effluent showed a significant inhibition effect at p 0 05 only for onion shoot growth fig 3b the treated tannery effluent imposed an inhibitory effect on both shoot growth of onion 15 while stimulates shoot growth in cabbage 0 36 inhibition a study done by asfaw et al 6 using 50 diluted tannery effluent showed that there was a significant negative effect on the growth of treatment vegetable 3 4 heavy metal accumulation in vegetables vegetable analysis showed that cr and cd have detectable concentrations in the analyzed sample while pb and ni were found below the minimum detection limit of flame aas 0 005 mg l the heavy metal concentrations in effluent samples were decreased in the order of cr cd pb and ni in the field experiment the mean total cr values mg kg in the edible portion of vegetables were in the following order tomato 0 197 0 005 carrot 0 122 0 002 cabbage 0 113 0 004 onion 0 098 0 002 swiss chard 0 088 0 001 beet root 0 05 0 001 fig 4 a the significant differences in cr concentrations among the different vegetables implied that each species had different abilities and capacities to take up and accumulate heavy metals table 3 which were supported by islam and hoque 19 the concentration of cd in edible portions of vegetables in all treatments was below permissible limits meanwhile no differences in cd values were observed between vegetables p 0 05 all the analyzed vegetable samples of the field treatments contained detectable concentrations of total cr and cd but in the pot experiment only cr was detected in the tomato 0 016 mg l cabbage 0 009 mg kg carrot 0 007 mg kg and swiss chard 0 006 mg kg table 3 the electrical conductivity in the final effluent was recorded lower than the standard limits which indicates the presence of a relatively low concentration of salts in the effluent and can be used for irrigation of vegetables however due to the accumulation of salts subsequent irrigation might buildup salinity in the soil 17 33 irrigation with tannery wastewater supposed to be significantly reduced vegetable growth due to high levels of chromium both in the contaminated soil and effluent 5 both form trivalent cr iii and hexavalent cr vi chromium are toxic to plants and inhibit germination reduce growth generate oxidative stress decrease protein content inhibit photosynthesis and alter enzyme activities in the exposed plants 31 36 however in the current study cr vi was not detected in the treated effluent sangeetha et al 34 also reported that the use of undiluted tannery effluents for irrigation can deteriorate the nutritional quality of plants nevertheless treated effluent improves plant yield due to its metals and organic components and may be beneficial if present in acceptable limits in this study due to the integration of treatment systems the treated effluents have lower cr and nutrient concentration this improves the growth of cabbage with minimal effect on swiss chard tomato and beetroot shoot growth but no effects on the carrot was observed table 3 the toxic effect of heavy metal on plant growth depends on the amount of heavy metal up taken from the specified environment pot and field experiment results with different cr soil content revealed that cr in the vegetables was mainly translocated from the soil to the vegetable this can also be shown by the low level of cr in the pot treatments vegetables where the soil before the experiment has no detectable cr concentration 0 005 mg kg according to fao 14 15 the maximum allowable concentration of cr and cd were 0 1 and 0 2 mg kg 1 respectively for leafy vegetables about 50 of the treatment vegetables from field samples were above the who fao standards for cr however the cd concentrations observed in all vegetable samples were below who fao guidelines the range of cr concentrations 0 05 0 197 mg kg 1 and cd 0 001 0 023 mg kg in edible portions of vegetables was less than the values found in rattan et al 33 irrigating industrial effluent contaminated river vegetables which are grown on akaki river also could have a considerably high level of cr cd ni pb and zn fissha 16 he reported that cr levels in vegetables varying from 1 25 to 2 81 mg kg in cabbage onion potato red beet and swiss chard which was almost ten times higher than those in the present study thus treated tannery wastewater irrigation was safer than using polluted rivers 3 16 12 soil analysis before and after the experiment showed that the tannery effluent 0 73 mg cr per liter irrigated soil showed an increase in its average cr concentration from 0 129 to 0 166 mg kg in four month intervals in the field experiment the mean total cr value in the treatment soils from the field experiment 0 166 mg kg was higher than the mean value of pot experiment 0 029 mg kg as shown in fig 4b the soil used for field vegetable growth was previously contaminated with cr in addition considerable amounts of heavy metals were found in soil irrigated with wastewater as compared with control soil irrigated with groundwater therefore irrigation with tannery effluent was believed to be responsible for soil enrichment with cr however the magnitude of cr in soils irrigated with tannery effluent was below the maximum permissible limit 3 mg kg as indicated by kabata pendias and pendias 20 3 5 bio transferable factor the bio transferable factor for cr in the field experiment was in the order of tomato 1 23 carrot 0 75 cabbage and 0 71 onion 0 62 swiss chard 0 0 46 beet root 0 31 and in pot experiment tomato 0 53 cabbage 0 29 beet root 0 026 fig 5 the result showed that the field experimental group has the highest bio transferable factor for all vegetables than the pot experiment indicating that the primary source of cr in the vegetable was previously the contaminated soil metal transfer factors from soil to vegetables were less significant for cr than zn mn cu fe and cd 32 this may be one factor for the low cr concentration in treatment vegetables 3 6 potential health risk estimation health risks associated with these heavy metals cr and cd through vegetable consumption were assessed based on the target hazard quotients thqs thqs include not only the intake of metals but also the exposure frequency and duration body weight and the oral reference dose oral reference doses ofd were taken 0 003 and 0 005 mg kg per day for cr and cd respectively 19 42 thq is the ratio between measured concentration and rfd weighted by the length and frequency of exposure amount ingested and body weight the thq 1 means the exposed population is assumed to be safe and 1 thq 5 means the exposed population is in the level of concern interval it must be noted that thq is not a measure of risk but indicates a level of concern 18 in this study the potential of health risk assessment was done based on who assessment of vegetable and fruit consumption in ethiopia the average amount of vegetable consumption in ethiopia is 25 4 kg person year 25 which is much less than the who fao recommended intake 86 kg per capita per year the results showed that cd pb and ni contamination in plants had the lowest potential to pose a health risk to the consumers normally chromium is known to have a health effect above 0 1 mg kg vegetables 2 15 however based on the amount of vegetable consumption the target hazard quotients thqs for cr were less than 1 0 073 in all the vegetables although fruits tomato have higher concentrations of cr than other vegetables the target hazard quotients thqs are lower 0 073 and the exposed population was assumed to be safe thus in this study the potential health risks posed by cr from treated tannery effluent were considered negligible based on the results of thqs a similar study by cui et al 12 has also reported that local residents of an area near modjo river have been exposed to cr through consumption of vegetables but no risk was found the study proved that the treated tannery effluent is suitable for irrigation of vegetables 4 conclusion the results show that the technical performance of the pilot integrated treatment system was efficient to treat high strength tannery wastewater and the treated effluent meets the acceptable minimum national and international discharge standards the treated tannery wastewater has a potential for reuse for irrigation vegetable analysis showed that cr concentration in field treatment vegetables such as tomato cabbage and carrot were slightly above the who fao heavy metal standards a higher heavy metal cr and cd concentration in a field experiment compared to pot experiment reflects that the major source of cr in the vegetables was the soil uptake capabilities and their further translocation from the soil to the edible portion of the vegetables was also another factor in vegetable heavy metal accumulation the study proved that the integrated treatment technology can turn tannery wastewater into value added products such as clean water possibly used for irrigation acknowledgements
