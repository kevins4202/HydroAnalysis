25245,in rhythmic tree growth the alternation between growth and resting phases can be either periodic or irregular depending on climatic and endogenous factors the aim of this study was to analyze the growth pattern of yerba mate a subtropical south american tree with monopodial and rhythmic growth over a two year period metamer emission rate of selected axes was followed during two years after a severe pruning in two cultivation systems contrasting for light conditions agroforestry system and monoculture a new longitudinal data modeling approach relying on hidden semi markov chains to identify growth and resting phases and multiple change point models to relate these phases to climatic factors was used despite large variability among individuals two growth phases separated by a resting phase were most often identified within each year contrasting situations regarding the modulation of the polycyclism were observed between the two years and cultivated systems in the first year of growth the pattern consisted of a single long growth phase in vigorous individuals and the cultivation system had a major effect likely due to the induced light environment in the second year some individuals did not grow during the second autumn phase likely due to the drought during the warm season the observed differences in growth patterns between years and cultivation systems were interpreted with respect to ontogenetic and climatic effects in interaction with endogenous factors resulting from plant reproductive phenology this study introduces a new longitudinal data analysis approach for investigating the phenology of perennial plants over long follow up periods at time scale intermediate between days and years keywords growth unit hidden semi markov chain ilex paraguariensis multiple change point model polycyclism rhythmic growth 1 introduction rhythmic growth is widely observed in plant species hallé et al 1978 it is characterized by the succession of periods of uninterrupted organ emission and extension and periods of rest the portion of a shoot developed during an uninterrupted period of extension is named growth unit gu hallé and martin 1968 when several successive gus are formed in the same annual vegetative cycle they most often present contrasting characteristics heuret et al 2003 in many species living in temperate climates the periods of rest are induced by the environment early experiments on young quercus robur have shown that plants grown in continuous darkness exhibited a continuous growth whereas very weak light intensities restored rhythmic growth barnola et al 1993 strong light intensities did not change the endogenous rhythmic growth characteristics but allowed branching moreover the entrance of buds into a period of inactivity at the end of the summer may be controlled by a decreasing day length and photoperiod based mechanisms caffarra et al 2011 paul et al 2014 possibly combined with low temperature effect in some species heide and prestrud 2005 the timing of growth cessation and resumption in response to changing climatic conditions is thus considered as a specific adaptive trait in temperate perennial species rinne et al 2001 in tropical and subtropical rainforests the temperature and rainfall are less restrictive for plant growth than in temperate conditions and the almost constant photoperiod permit an easy observation of growth rhythmicity hallé and martin 1968 heuret et al 2002 not imposed by winter low temperatures and short days as in temperate climate in these conditions a large variability in the expression of growth branching and flowering processes can be observed leading to a large variability in plant architecture hallé et al 1978 when growth is rhythmic alternation between growth and resting phases can be either periodic or irregular nicolini et al 2012 this may result in synchronized or desynchronized axes at the plant scale as observed in many tropical trees borchert 1983 such as cecropia spp heuret et al 2002 zalamea et al 2008 avocado thorp and sedgley 1992 or cacao greathouse et al 1971 moreover growth rhythmicity and polycyclism are considered as expressions of plasticity allowing plants to adapt to drought conditions la mantia et al 2003 grossiord et al 2017 and light availability verdu and climent 2007 yerba mate ilex paraguariensis st hil is a dioecious species whose leaves and fine green branches are widely used for beverage preparation it naturally develops in subtropical rainforest under araucaria angustifolia where it can reach a height of 15 m yerba mate develops according to rauh s architectural model with monopodial and rhythmic growth hallé et al 1978 growth dynamics of yerba mate exhibits two gus per year one in spring and another in autumn separated by two annual resting phases one in summer total or partial and another in winter yerba mate shows morphological structural and physiological sexual dimorphism rakocevic et al 2009 the shrub form resulting from frequent pruning that are required to collect biomass every 18 24 months tends to differ between females and males rakocevic et al 2011 when low water availability and low temperatures are imposed during spring or autumn females are more affected than males in their biomass production matsunaga et al 2014 as many forest species naturally growing adult yerba mate plants respond strongly to light conditions when grown in monoculture i e with high light availability they show higher metamer emission and biomass production than when grown in agroforestry system with low light availability rakocevic and martim 2011 matsunaga et al 2014 the hypothesis of our study was that these two cultivation systems influence growth flushes and resting phases we thus analyzed the growth pattern of yerba mate over a two year period that follows a severe pruning comparing plants grown in agroforestry system and monoculture moreover our aim was to decipher the effects of cultivation system ontogeny and climatic conditions on the growth pattern to this end we applied dedicated statistical models for identifying growth and resting phases on the basis of growth follow up data we applied two types of segmentation models that played complementary roles i hidden semi markov chains for the asynchronous segmentation of individuals dambreville et al 2015 and ii multiple change point models for the synchronous segmentation of individuals perrotte et al 2016 these segmentation models were used to characterize i yerba mate growth pattern and its ontogenetic change over the two years of growth ii the impact of contrasting light conditions and iii the influence of fluctuating climatic conditions on this growth pattern 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site climatic data collection and plant description the experimental field was situated in barão de cotegipe 27 37 15 s and 52 22 47 w 765 m above sea level rio grande do sul state southern brazil two contrasted areas were chosen at 100 m apart a rainforest enriched with yerba mate agroforestry system and a monoculture of yerba mate the seedlings issued from the same seed collection and from the same mother tree were planted in the field in spring 1999 at a distance of 2 5 2 5 m in the agroforestry system and 2 5 1 5 m in monoculture respectively the experiment started in june 2003 after a severe pruning of fifteen four year old yerba mate plants april 2003 selected in each cultivation system after pruning trees were formed of a trunk of about 80 cm and some low positioned lateral axes corresponding to a maintenance of about 10 15 of the leaf area in order to continue the assimilation process in the period up to bud break the two cultivation systems were maintained with no additional chemical inputs using only plant residues manual mechanical weed elimination was carried out twice in monoculture during the experiment while in the agroforestry system weeds were not in competition with trees because of low light availability the climate of barão de cotegipe region is defined as subtropical humid cfa according to köppen s classification kottek et al 2006 with rainfalls regularly distributed over the year and an average temperature above 22 c in the hottest month in this region a short period with temperatures below 0 c occurs during winter even though the maximum daily temperature could reach 30 c in winter the day night lengths vary from 10 h and 24 min to 13 h and 54 min the soil under the two cultivation systems is classified as rhodic haplodux the minimum and maximum daily temperatures and daily rainfalls were obtained by agritempo http www agritempo gov br light microclimate of yerba mate cultivated in monoculture can be characterized by an incident photosynthetically active radiation par reduction of about 10 38 on leaves of tips compared to an open area in the agroforestry system only 2 10 of incident par reached yerba mate leaves compared to the open area moreover leaf temperatures were contrasting between the two cultivation systems rakocevic et al 2008 during the day of the hottest months leaf temperatures were 5 9 c lower in the agroforestry system compared to sun exposed leaves in monoculture in contrast in winter the leaves of plants in the agroforestry system had a minimum temperature about 2 4 c higher than in monoculture in the early morning and end of afternoon matsunaga et al 2014 in yerba mate all axes are equivalent with respect to their orientation and phyllotactic angles there is one lateral bud in the axil of each leaf in yerba mate phyllotaxy is spiral and constant 2 5 between two adjacent leaves rakocevic et al 2011 flowers and fruits develop in axillary positions along branches the lateral branches are grouped before scars of very short internodes which separate annual shoots into successive gus during the experiment three main axes were selected on 15 trees grown in each of the two cultivation systems the number of newly emerged metamers were measured on each axis during two years of growth from june 2003 to may 2005 due to severe pruning before our experiment no preformed organs could be identified when observations started at each observation date the last metamer which leaf was separated from the apical bunch was tagged with a colored label even though the internode length and leaf area could increase after metamer labelling a metamer was considered as appeared and therefore counted with respect to its leaf emergence the lateral branches appeared immediately during parent growth unit extension but branching was not considered in the present study rakocevic et al 2012 we observed 90 main axes in total 45 in the agroforestry system and 45 in monoculture from june to august 2003 new shoots were emitted but a number of them did not survive because this survival was higher in the agroforestry system compared to the monoculture the initial data set was misbalanced plant gender could not be controlled at plantation and the genders were therefore unbalanced within each cultivation system 12 females and 33 males were observed in the agroforestry system and 30 females and 15 males in monoculture since the dates of measurement were unevenly spaced either half a month or a month between two successive measurement occasions depending on the season the measurements were converted into metamer emission rates for this the number of newly emerged metamers per month was converted into number of newly emerged metamers per two weeks in the case of an interval of a month between two successive measurement occasions the data thus consists of unevenly spaced metamer emission rate series of length 37 26 intervals of half a month and 11 intervals of a month between two successive measurement occasions it should be noted that the monthly measurement periods corresponded to the less favourable growing periods e g the austral subtropical winter and we could not expect a significant gain in information with an evenly spaced sampling every half a month during this period 2 2 growth pattern analysis typically the growth pattern of yerba mate alternates growth phases with resting phases along the two years of growth follow up we thus assumed that the growth pattern takes the form of a succession of well differentiated homogeneous phases where the distribution of the metamer emission rate does not change substantially within each phase but change markedly between growth and resting phases this growth pattern was analysed using two types of segmentation models that played complementary roles hidden semi markov chains for the asynchronous segmentation of individuals in order to highlight commonality and differences between individuals and cultivation systems multiple change point models for the synchronous segmentation of individuals in order to study the influence of climatic factors based on phases common to the individuals 2 2 1 asynchronous segmentation of individuals in growth and resting phases using hidden semi markov chains the metamer emission rate series were simply indexed by the ranks of the successive measurement occasions for the building of hidden semi markov chains and the unevenly spacing between measurement occasions were thus not considered in these models hidden semi markov chains hsmcs are two scale segmentation models see methods s1 for a formal definition in our context the alternation between growth and resting phases and their durations coarse scale are represented by a non observable semi markov chain while the metamer emission rate within a phase fine scale is represented by observation distributions attached to each state of the semi markov chain hence each state of the semi markov chain represents either a growth or a resting phase a semi markov chain is defined by three subsets of parameters initial probabilities π j j 0 j 1 to model which is the first phase occurring at the beginning of the measurement transition probabilities p i j i j 0 j 1 to model the succession of phases occupancy distributions attached to non absorbing states a state is said to be absorbing if after entering this state it is impossible to leave it to model the phase duration in number of successive measurements we used as possible parametric state occupancy distributions binomial distributions b d n p poisson distributions p d λ and negative binomial distributions nb d r p with an additional shift parameter d 1 a hsmc adds a fourth subset of parameters to the three subsets of parameters previously defined for the underlying semi markov chain observation distributions to model the metamer emission rate within a phase unimodal discrete parametric observation distributions chosen among binomial distributions b d n p poisson distributions p d λ and negative binomial distributions nb d r p with an additional shift parameter d 0 were used to model these count data since the dates of measurement were unevenly spaced either half a month or a month between two successive measurements and the state occupancies were expressed in number of successive measurements the estimated state occupancy distributions were not directly interpretable the estimated hsmc should therefore be considered as a tool to segment the metamer emission rate series in successive phases the estimated hsmc was used to compute the most probable state series for each observed series guédon 2003 this restored state series can be viewed as the optimal segmentation of the corresponding metamer emission rate series into sub series each corresponding to a given phase on the basis of the optimal segmentations of the metamer emission rate series contextual model parameters e g probability of transition between two phases or distribution of the metamer emission rate for a given phase or characteristic distributions e g probability of a phase at a given date specific to individuals grown in either the agroforestry system or monoculture were extracted renton et al 2006 in order to compare the two cultivation systems 2 2 2 synchronous segmentation of individuals using multiple change point models in order to explore the influence of the climatic factors on the growth pattern we assumed that the phases were common for the different individuals and used multiple change point models for the synchronous segmentation of the metamer emission rate series of the different individuals see methods s2 for a formal definition of multiple change point models and associated statistical methods the data to be segmented thus consists of a multivariate series of length 37 the number of measurement occasions where each variable corresponds to an individual 45 individuals for the agroforestry and the monoculture sample respectively 90 individuals for the pooled sample when applying a synchronous segmentation the frequency distributions of the metamer emission rate within a given growth phase were often bimodal with a clump at zero and a separate hump around some higher value results not shown this shape can be interpreted as a consequence of the assumption of synchronous segmentation in phases which is not perfectly fulfilled since beginning and end of growth were not strictly synchronous for all the individuals nevertheless this synchronicity assumption was useful to explore the influence of the climatic factors on the growth pattern these frequency distributions can be modelled by 2 component mixture models where the first component is degenerate with a probability mass of 1 at 0 and the second component is for instance a negative binomial distribution this 2 component mixture model is thus a zero inflated negative binomial distribution π i n 0 1 π n b n d r p n 0 0 π 1 where i is the indicator function standard parametric unimodal distributions e g poisson or negative binomial were thus not appropriate in our case for synchronous segmentation we therefore chose to group the values of the observed variable metamer emission rate according to the zero inflated distribution assumption and to directly estimate probability masses for the possible categories within a given phase corresponding to the partitions of values 0 1 5 6 10 10 0 1 5 6 10 11 15 15 and 0 1 5 6 10 11 15 16 20 20 see the corresponding frequency distributions in table s1 the rather large sample sizes 45 or 90 individuals to be multiply by the number of measurement occasions within a phase justify the direct estimation of probability masses for these categories the kullback leibler divergence criterion proposed by guédon 2015 was used to determine the number of phases and different diagnostic tools were used to assess the assumption of the segmentation in stationary phases 2 2 3 relationships between phases and climatic factors the response of perennial plants to changing climatic conditions is difficult to investigate because of the difference in time scale between plant response variables every two weeks or every month in our case and daily climatic variables on the one hand and the inertia of such large scale organisms on the other hand which often entails a delayed response to change of climatic conditions we thus chose to smooth the climatic variable using symmetric smoothing filters corresponding to the probability mass function of the binomial distribution chatfield 2003 in order to remove the fluctuations of climatic variables and then simply explored the correspondence between phases synchronous for all the individuals and smoothed climatic variables 3 results 3 1 exploratory analysis the cumulative number of metamers per individual after the two years of growth was very variable both in the agroforestry system between 15 and 145 with a mean of 76 1 and a standard deviation of 31 4 and in monoculture between 56 and 198 with a mean of 112 5 and a standard deviation of 36 7 male and female metamer emission rate frequency distributions over the two years i e distribution of the metamer emission rate pooling all the successive periods between two measurements were compared between the two cultivation systems using the two tailed wilcoxon mann whitney test we did not find significant difference between males and females in both the agroforestry system 33 males and 12 females corresponding respectively to 1221 metamer emission rates with a mean of 1 76 in number of newly emerged metamers per two weeks and a standard deviation of 3 33 and 444 metamer emission rates with a mean of 1 68 and a standard deviation of 4 04 p value of 0 07 and in monoculture 15 males and 30 females corresponding respectively to 555 metamer emission rates with a mean of 2 68 and a standard deviation of 4 72 and 1110 metamer emission rates with a mean of 2 74 and a standard deviation of 4 78 p value of 0 85 we thus chose to pool males and females for further analyses the cumulative number of metamers along time shows growth phases separated by resting phases two growth units can easily be identified in the second year of growth figs 1b and 2b while the situation is more ambiguous in the first year of growth with either two short growth units separated by a resting phase or a single long growth unit in terms of growth duration figs 1a and 2a the pointwise average metamer emission rates computed for the two cultivation systems fig 3 show that the difference in growth pattern between them mainly concerned the first year of growth 3 2 identification and characterization of growth and resting phases the alternation between growth and resting phases over the two years was modelled by a 10 state hsmc composed of successive transient states followed by a final absorbing state fig 4 a state is said to be transient if after leaving this state it is impossible to return to it hence each transient state can be visited at most once in the following the effective growth phases will be referred to as growth units followed by the year index 1 or 2 and eventually the rank within the year for instance gu1 refers to the sole growth unit of the first year and gu2 2 to the second growth unit of the second year following the same principle r1 2 refers to the resting phase between the first and the second year while r1 1 refers to the resting phase between gu1 1 and gu1 2 the transition distributions estimated for all the states corresponding to growth phases long gu1 gu1 1 gu1 2 gu2 1 and gu2 2 and for the state corresponding to the resting phase r1 2 were degenerate i e p i j 1 for a single state j and p i k 0 for k j fig 4 this was the result of the iterative estimation procedure the average metamer emission rate was between 0 03 and 0 58 for resting phases while it was between 3 95 and 9 27 for growth phases the metamer emission rate series were then segmented in growth and resting phases using the estimated hsmc the posterior probabilities of the optimal segmentations i e weight of the optimal segmentation among all the possible segmentations of a given metamer emission rate series were generally high 82 above 0 05 59 above 0 1 and 26 above 0 25 to be related to a number of possible segmentations between 3 4 105 and 2 9 107 all these properties of the estimated parameters and the optimal segmentations of the metamer emission rate series confirm the proper identification of growth and resting phases using the estimated hmsc on the basis of the optimal segmentations of the metamer emission rate series various distributions were extracted for individuals grown in either the agroforestry system or monoculture the successions of phases can be compared between the two cultivation systems using the initial distribution and the non degenerate transition distributions corresponding to transition from r0 1 r1 1 and r2 1 table 1 and fig 4 they are also summarized in fig 5 as a set of probability curves the two cultivation systems differ in four aspects regarding the succession of phases 1 some agroforestry system individuals started growing at the very beginning of the observation period in june while the other agroforestry system individuals and the monoculture individuals started growing two months later in august see the initial distributions in table 1 and the probability curves at the first date of measurement in fig 5a 2 in the first year of growth there were either a single long growth phase from august to march or two rather short growth phases the first from august to mid october and the second from january to march separated by a resting phase the first situation was far more frequent in monoculture than in the agroforestry system table 1 and figs 4 and 5 3 in the first year of growth some agroforestry system individuals only have a first short growth phase table 1 and fig 4 4 in the second year of growth there were either two short growth phases the first from august to mid october and the second from mid january to march separated by a resting phase or only a first short growth phase the occurrence of the second short growth phase was more frequent in the agroforestry system individuals table 1 and fig 4 it should be noted that gu2 1 and the resting phases r1 2 r2 1 and r2 3 were shared by all the individuals whatever the cultivation system fig 4 the growth intensity within phases can be compared between the two cultivation systems using the distributions of the metamer emission rate for a given phase table 2 the mean metamer emission rate of gu1 1 and long gu1 was higher in monoculture than in the agroforestry system table 2 and fig 3 this suggests that the phyllochron time period necessary for a new metamer emission differed between the two cultivation systems the highest phyllochron was found for gu1 2 whatever the cultivation system with a mean value of about 1 6 days in monoculture and about 1 7 days in agroforestry system table 2 the metamer emission rate in gu1 2 and gu2 2 which developed in autumn did not differ between the two cultivation systems table 2 these results are confirmed by the comparison of the number of metamers of gus between the two cultivation systems and the two years of observation table 3 which shows that the phyllochron is the main determinant of the number of metamers of gus the corresponding growth periods being often rather similar between the two cultivation systems figs 4 and 5 even if some compensation phenomena may exist for instance for gu2 1 the cumulative number of metamers after one year for individuals having a long gu1 was in average about twice those for individuals not having a long gu1 89 compared to 46 5 in this case we did not distinguish agroforestry system from monoculture individuals since only 6 agroforestry system individuals among 45 had a long gu1 instead of 19 individuals among 45 for monoculture individuals this difference was propagated in the second year with some attenuation 46 8 instead of 31 8 for the mean cumulative number of metamers and 72 instead of 57 of individuals having gu2 2 there were thus a decrease and homogenization of growth between the two years 3 3 exploration of the relationships between phases and climatic factors since the phase change were rather synchronous fig 5 we chose to explore possible synchronous segmentations of individuals for each cultivation system and also globally in order to study the influence of climatic factors on the growth pattern height growth phases were selected both for the agroforestry system and monoculture using the kullback leibler divergence criterion in each cultivation system two alternative segmentations were found that differ only for the position of a single limit between two successive phases table s2 five among height of these phases were close the main differences concerned the second phase identified in the agroforestry system that was split in two phases in monoculture while the two last phases identified in the agroforestry system were merged in monoculture we thus chose to segment the pooled sample we found 10 phases synchronous for all the individuals and retained them for further investigation of the influence of climatic factors multiple change point models make two supplementary strong assumptions with respect to hsmcs i the segmentation is common to all the individuals and ii the succession of phases is deterministic meaning that there are no alternative phases at a given date of measurement as a consequence the 10 phases correspond to three possible situations with respect to the hsmc states fig 4 1 a phase directly corresponds to a single hsmc state if there are no states in parallel e g r1 2 r2 1 or r2 3 2 a phase corresponds to 2 alternative states e g long gu1 and gu1 1 3 a short phase may reflect the asynchronous beginning or end of growth of individuals the 10 synchronous phases can be described as follows for each phase the first and last dates of measurement are given in months phase 1 1 3 resting phase r0 1 for most of the individuals or beginning of growth for some agroforestry system individuals 12 among 45 phase 2 3 5 4 beginning of gu1 1 for 65 individuals among 90 or long gu1 for the other 25 individuals these proportions propagate in phases 3 and 4 phase 3 4 5 5 5 end of gu1 1 or continuation of long gu1 this continuation corresponds to slower growth with respect to phase 2 phase 4 6 10 5 resting phase r1 1 followed by a growing phase gu1 2 for 59 among 65 individuals or end of long gu1 phase 5 11 13 resting phase r1 2 phase 6 14 15 beginning of gu2 1 or end of r1 2 the asynchronous beginning of growth of individuals explains this phase phase 7 16 17 end of gu2 1 phase 8 17 5 20 resting phase r2 1 phase 9 20 5 21 5 gu2 2 for 55 individuals among 90 and beginning of r2 3 for the other individuals phase 10 22 24 resting phase r2 3 the posterior probability of the selected segmentation i e weight of the optimal segmentation among all the possible segmentations for a fixed number of phases was always high this probability was 0 29 in the agroforestry system and 0 61 in monoculture to be related to 8 3 106 possible segmentations for 8 growth phases this probability was 0 98 for the pooled sample to be related to 94 106 possible segmentations for 10 growth phases the daily minimum and maximum temperature fig 6 and cumulative rainfall fig 7 were smoothed using a symmetric smoothing filter corresponding to the probability mass function of the binomial distribution of parameters 256 and 0 5 95 of the mass concentrated on the 31 central values in order to relate these climatic factors to the phases synchronous for all the individuals the austral subtropical winter cold season indeed corresponds to resting phases r1 0 r1 2 and r2 3 while the alternation between growth and resting phases within the warm season seems to be linked to the amount of rainfall with some delayed effect as illustrated by gu2 2 which follows a marked rainfall period fig 7 the marked drought period approximately between days 175 and 210 during the warm season of the second year may explain the less frequent occurrence of gu2 2 in the monoculture individuals 33 individuals among 45 instead of 22 among 45 for monoculture fig 4 and table 1 since we expect an amplified effect of drought in monoculture compared to the agroforestry system this is in contrast with the first year of growth whose warm season was not affected by a drought period and for which only a few agroforestry systems individuals 6 among 33 did not produce a second gu among the individuals which made the resting phase r1 1 during the warm season in this case the light environment induced by the cultivation system was likely the main effect considering the non limiting effect of water availability 4 discussion 4 1 well defined growth and resting phases and plant ontogeny well defined growth and resting phases were identified in the studied two year period thanks to the segmentation based on hsmc table 2 figs 4 and 5 in both years the growth pattern was characterized by a systematic resting phase corresponding to a period with relatively cold temperatures whereas resting phases in the middle of the year were frequent but not mandatory in the first year some individuals developed a single long gu without any resting phase by contrast in the second year the resting phase in the middle of the year r2 1 was systematic thus leading to polycyclic shoots the pattern of succession of monocyclic and polycyclic shoots found in yerba mate is a phenomenon that has been previously observed in other species for instance in four year old red oak heuret et al 2003 monocyclic and polycyclic shoots could be emitted in the same growth period but the probability of monocyclic was higher in the first year also in apple tree very long monocyclic shoots were observed in an adolescent phase followed by long polycyclic shoots and thereafter monocyclic shoots during the adult phase costes and guédon 2012 generally the succession from long monocyclic to polycyclic and shorter monocyclic annual shoots can be interpreted as an ontogenetic effect leading to the progressive reduction of primary growth with tree ageing heuret et al 2006 barthélémy and caraglio 2007 in the second year small or non significant differences were observed in the gu characteristics between the two cultivation systems table 2 indicating that the endogenous rhythmic growth control would interplay with growth cessation modulated by external factors herrmann et al 2015 this interplay occurred more frequently in the agroforestry system and in younger than older shoots decreasing growth differences with years which is likely to result in progressive homogenization of shoot length with ontogeny as previously observed in other species barthélémy and caraglio 2007 4 2 variability among individuals individual asynchronism was revealed fig 5 which highlights variability among individual growth patterns this could be partly attributed to the genetic variability of the population used in this study in fact yerba mate plants were issued from the same seed collection i e from the same mother plant but the pollination was provided by numerous father plants different growth patterns depending on the family have been previously observed in other species e g pinus radiata codesido and fernadez 2009 in which families growing throughout the year can be distinguished from families growing episodically depending on rainfall the observed asynchronism among yerba mate individuals could also result from heterogeneous initial states of the shoots after severe pruning such pruning promotes traumatic reiterations a natural process that allows the plant to duplicate totally and partially its architecture oldeman 1974 but also enhance growth of the remaining unpruned axes fumey et al 2011 shoots emerging after severe pruning of large branches also called epicormics usually develop more extension than other shoots as shown in peach and almond trees dejong et al 2012 negrón et al 2014 in yerba mate they had an unknown origin epicormic or axillary bud of the previous year and this could partially explain the larger variability in the first than in the second year after pruning 4 3 effect of climatic conditions on growth rhythm in temperate regions tree phenology is synchronized yearly by cold temperatures and short photoperiod during autumn and winter and by the dormancy process which ensures appropriate timing of bud development by analogy the main shoot meristems in yerba mate stayed in resting stages r0 1 r1 2 and r2 3 over the subtropical winter probably due to minimal temperatures about 10 c fig 6 rakocevic and martim 2011 and short photoperiod about 10 h other climatic factors than temperature may be responsible for yerba mate growth rhythmicity in particular the seasonality of rainfall however in the present study the cumulative rainfall effect should be interpreted with caution fig 7 because of the difference in time scale between plant response variables every two weeks or every month in our case and daily rainfall and the often delayed and smoothed response of a perennial plant to a rainfall event in tropical rainforest water availability has been shown to have the determining role for tree growth seasonal variations wagner et al 2012 despite these limitations in modeling the relationship between rainfall and yerba mate growth we observed in the second year of growth a marked drought period that was not present in the first year this can be linked to the systematic occurrence of the resting phase at the middle of the second year growth resumption following this resting phase i e the occurrence of gu2 2 was also more frequent in the agroforestry system than in monoculture fig 4 this suggests a higher growth capacity possibly due to higher soil water storage reducing competition for available water resources in agroforestry system as previously demonstrated e g anderson et al 2009 4 4 impact of the cultivation systems and interaction with climatic conditions the number of growth units and their characteristics differed markedly in a given year between the two cultivation systems the only exception being the systematic occurrence of gu2 1 tables 1 and 2 fig 4 in the spring period a higher mean metamer emission rate was observed in monoculture than in agroforestry system despite slightly lower plant density in agroforestry than in monoculture the reduced light availability did not counterbalance the difference in metamer emission rate this difference was likely to result from the light conditions since monoculture enables more favorable light conditions and higher assimilation rate rakocevic et al 2009 with consequences on higher carbon investments matsunaga et al 2014 that could favor gu1 1 long gu1 and gu2 1 formation moreover individuals in monoculture developed more frequently a long gu1 than those in the agroforestry system 42 and 13 respectively table 1 figs 4 and 5 high light conditions in monoculture promoting uninterrupted growth in the first year is consistent with previous studies on oak and maple trees which have demonstrated that growth rhythmicity and polycyclism could be related to low light and understory conditions barnola et al 1993 verdu and climent 2007 the prolongation of primary growth leading to the development of additional metamers and leaf area and therefore increasing carbon capture and transpiration or on the contrary the entrance into a resting phase constitute a large part of tree plasticity in response to environmental conditions and their fluctuations our results suggest a fine ecological tuning of this growth cessation at both individual and plot population scales considering that resource availability and acquisition rather modulate than trigger rhythmic growth herrmann et al 2015 4 5 endogenous effects on growth rhythm differences in the cumulative number of metamers and the metamer emission rates were observed between spring and autumn growth phases that could result from competition among organs indeed the first growth units at spring developed over three months when regrowth flowering pollination and initial fruit formation occurred reproduction is expensive for plants since reproductive organs flowers and initial fruit formation represent strong sinks their growth is often negatively correlated with vegetative growth because both biological functions compete for the same resources e g koenig and knops 1998 this competition is likely to explain the difference in the mean number of metamers of the spring growth units compared with the autumn growth units table 2 the second growth phases in each year gu1 2 and gu2 2 did not differ between the individuals in the two cultivation systems table 2 their formation occurred during autumn when only vegetative growth and maintenance functions were happening finally despite that in yerba mate all axes orders have identical morphology and flowers borne laterally have little effect on the topology of the vegetative shoot system the investment in flowering and initial fruit formation could be partly responsible for the growth cessation after spring flushes similarly the competition among developing organs for resources could explain lower metamer emission rate observed in the spring growth phases than in the autumn growth phase table 2 even though the phyllochron is rarely observed in tree species it has been shown to vary among species in continuously grown banana tree about 6 6 7 1 days are necessary for a metamer emission kuttimani et al 2013 in cecropia sciadophylla about 25 metamers appear in one annual cycle zalamea et al 2008 in peach phyllochron is shown to vary between 25 to 40 h under controlled conditions davidson et al 2015 while in field grown arabica coffee seasonal fluctuations and variations are observed between axis orders rakocevic and matsunaga 2018 in rhythmic grown yerba mate relatively large variations in metamer emission rate were observed within a year from 1 5 to 1 7 days during the most rapid phase to 3 1 3 9 days during the slowest phase in monoculture and agroforestry system respectively stronger fluctuations in metamer emission rate under the agroforestry system than in monoculture are likely to contribute to individual plasticity to environmental conditions and are consistent with yerba mate being a shade tolerant species osada et al 2012 the source of variations observed in yerba mate would require further analyses possibly with observations at finer time scale in particular the within individual synchronism of axis growth with other processes such as branching or secondary growth would deserve additional observations as those made by nicolini et al 2012 4 6 statistical models for identifying phenological phases the phenological pattern of plants often takes the form of succession of well differentiated phases this has been shown in previous studies concerning contrasting species observed at various scales phenological phases were identified in multivariate series of daily growth rates of axis and selected leaves in mango tree shoots dambreville et al 2015 2017 and in univariate series of numbers of weekly emerged inflorescences in strawberry perrotte et al 2016 this study of yerba mate complements these previous studies at a coarser time scale with phenological series covering a longer time period all these studies relied on prospective measurements i e plant growth or development follow up but for coarser time scales such as year studies often relied on retrospective measurements as illustrated by the identification of growth phases in forestry contexts guédon et al 2007 chaubert pereira et al 2009 taugourdeau et al 2011 the analysis of phenological series falls into the statistical domain of longitudinal data analysis diggle et al 2002 where a relatively large number of individuals are observed repeatedly over time the specificity of phenological patterns often lies in the well defined phenological phases which require dedicated segmentation models such as hidden semi markov chains and multiple change point models for their identification these families of statistical models should be viewed as statistical frameworks which can be easily adapted to various designs in terms of types of observed variables e g categorical count or interval scale variable taking account of group effect e g genotype or cultivation system effect or time dependent effect e g climatic effect is a key issue than can be tackled using various approaches for instance a model was built for each genotype in dambreville et al 2015 and perrotte et al 2016 while a single model was built here for the two cultivation systems from which contextual parameters and characteristics were extracted for each cultivation system the thermal time was used in dambreville et al 2015 2017 to take account of the effect of temperature on growth the thermal time can be viewed as a non linear transform of the calendar time that plays the role of an implicit time varying temperature explanatory variable that modulates organ growth with reference to regression models other generalizations of hidden semi markov chains have been proposed in chaubert pereira et al 2009 and taugourdeau et al 2011 such as the incorporation of time dependent explanatory variables for modeling the influence of climatic factors and the incorporation of random effects for modeling the inter individual heterogeneity within each growth phase in conclusion well defined growth and resting phases were identified in yerba mate during a two year period after pruning despite large variability among individuals our results suggest a dormancy like period in yerba mate related to subtropical low temperatures whereas endogenous mechanisms together with competition for carbohydrate among sinks could be responsible for summer resting phase and for different metamer emission rates between spring and autumn growth phases the summer resting phase appeared to be modulated by environmental factors since higher light conditions enabled longer gu1 formation in monoculture than in the agroforestry system in the first year also the summer drought period observed in the second year led to different patterns with more frequent growth resumption after the summer rest period in agroforestry system suggesting a better water storage altogether these results confirm the role of polycyclism in plant plasticity in response to environmental conditions in this study we introduced two families of models for longitudinal data analysis hidden semi markov chains and multiple change point models which appeared robust and complementary the proposed approach enabled us to take account of the complexity of plant growth and to properly decipher the role of ontogeny light environment and climatic conditions in the growth of yerba mate it opens an avenue for future studies on other perennial plants observed at intermediate time scales between day and year in order to provide a comprehensive view of plant growth pattern

25245,in rhythmic tree growth the alternation between growth and resting phases can be either periodic or irregular depending on climatic and endogenous factors the aim of this study was to analyze the growth pattern of yerba mate a subtropical south american tree with monopodial and rhythmic growth over a two year period metamer emission rate of selected axes was followed during two years after a severe pruning in two cultivation systems contrasting for light conditions agroforestry system and monoculture a new longitudinal data modeling approach relying on hidden semi markov chains to identify growth and resting phases and multiple change point models to relate these phases to climatic factors was used despite large variability among individuals two growth phases separated by a resting phase were most often identified within each year contrasting situations regarding the modulation of the polycyclism were observed between the two years and cultivated systems in the first year of growth the pattern consisted of a single long growth phase in vigorous individuals and the cultivation system had a major effect likely due to the induced light environment in the second year some individuals did not grow during the second autumn phase likely due to the drought during the warm season the observed differences in growth patterns between years and cultivation systems were interpreted with respect to ontogenetic and climatic effects in interaction with endogenous factors resulting from plant reproductive phenology this study introduces a new longitudinal data analysis approach for investigating the phenology of perennial plants over long follow up periods at time scale intermediate between days and years keywords growth unit hidden semi markov chain ilex paraguariensis multiple change point model polycyclism rhythmic growth 1 introduction rhythmic growth is widely observed in plant species hallé et al 1978 it is characterized by the succession of periods of uninterrupted organ emission and extension and periods of rest the portion of a shoot developed during an uninterrupted period of extension is named growth unit gu hallé and martin 1968 when several successive gus are formed in the same annual vegetative cycle they most often present contrasting characteristics heuret et al 2003 in many species living in temperate climates the periods of rest are induced by the environment early experiments on young quercus robur have shown that plants grown in continuous darkness exhibited a continuous growth whereas very weak light intensities restored rhythmic growth barnola et al 1993 strong light intensities did not change the endogenous rhythmic growth characteristics but allowed branching moreover the entrance of buds into a period of inactivity at the end of the summer may be controlled by a decreasing day length and photoperiod based mechanisms caffarra et al 2011 paul et al 2014 possibly combined with low temperature effect in some species heide and prestrud 2005 the timing of growth cessation and resumption in response to changing climatic conditions is thus considered as a specific adaptive trait in temperate perennial species rinne et al 2001 in tropical and subtropical rainforests the temperature and rainfall are less restrictive for plant growth than in temperate conditions and the almost constant photoperiod permit an easy observation of growth rhythmicity hallé and martin 1968 heuret et al 2002 not imposed by winter low temperatures and short days as in temperate climate in these conditions a large variability in the expression of growth branching and flowering processes can be observed leading to a large variability in plant architecture hallé et al 1978 when growth is rhythmic alternation between growth and resting phases can be either periodic or irregular nicolini et al 2012 this may result in synchronized or desynchronized axes at the plant scale as observed in many tropical trees borchert 1983 such as cecropia spp heuret et al 2002 zalamea et al 2008 avocado thorp and sedgley 1992 or cacao greathouse et al 1971 moreover growth rhythmicity and polycyclism are considered as expressions of plasticity allowing plants to adapt to drought conditions la mantia et al 2003 grossiord et al 2017 and light availability verdu and climent 2007 yerba mate ilex paraguariensis st hil is a dioecious species whose leaves and fine green branches are widely used for beverage preparation it naturally develops in subtropical rainforest under araucaria angustifolia where it can reach a height of 15 m yerba mate develops according to rauh s architectural model with monopodial and rhythmic growth hallé et al 1978 growth dynamics of yerba mate exhibits two gus per year one in spring and another in autumn separated by two annual resting phases one in summer total or partial and another in winter yerba mate shows morphological structural and physiological sexual dimorphism rakocevic et al 2009 the shrub form resulting from frequent pruning that are required to collect biomass every 18 24 months tends to differ between females and males rakocevic et al 2011 when low water availability and low temperatures are imposed during spring or autumn females are more affected than males in their biomass production matsunaga et al 2014 as many forest species naturally growing adult yerba mate plants respond strongly to light conditions when grown in monoculture i e with high light availability they show higher metamer emission and biomass production than when grown in agroforestry system with low light availability rakocevic and martim 2011 matsunaga et al 2014 the hypothesis of our study was that these two cultivation systems influence growth flushes and resting phases we thus analyzed the growth pattern of yerba mate over a two year period that follows a severe pruning comparing plants grown in agroforestry system and monoculture moreover our aim was to decipher the effects of cultivation system ontogeny and climatic conditions on the growth pattern to this end we applied dedicated statistical models for identifying growth and resting phases on the basis of growth follow up data we applied two types of segmentation models that played complementary roles i hidden semi markov chains for the asynchronous segmentation of individuals dambreville et al 2015 and ii multiple change point models for the synchronous segmentation of individuals perrotte et al 2016 these segmentation models were used to characterize i yerba mate growth pattern and its ontogenetic change over the two years of growth ii the impact of contrasting light conditions and iii the influence of fluctuating climatic conditions on this growth pattern 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site climatic data collection and plant description the experimental field was situated in barão de cotegipe 27 37 15 s and 52 22 47 w 765 m above sea level rio grande do sul state southern brazil two contrasted areas were chosen at 100 m apart a rainforest enriched with yerba mate agroforestry system and a monoculture of yerba mate the seedlings issued from the same seed collection and from the same mother tree were planted in the field in spring 1999 at a distance of 2 5 2 5 m in the agroforestry system and 2 5 1 5 m in monoculture respectively the experiment started in june 2003 after a severe pruning of fifteen four year old yerba mate plants april 2003 selected in each cultivation system after pruning trees were formed of a trunk of about 80 cm and some low positioned lateral axes corresponding to a maintenance of about 10 15 of the leaf area in order to continue the assimilation process in the period up to bud break the two cultivation systems were maintained with no additional chemical inputs using only plant residues manual mechanical weed elimination was carried out twice in monoculture during the experiment while in the agroforestry system weeds were not in competition with trees because of low light availability the climate of barão de cotegipe region is defined as subtropical humid cfa according to köppen s classification kottek et al 2006 with rainfalls regularly distributed over the year and an average temperature above 22 c in the hottest month in this region a short period with temperatures below 0 c occurs during winter even though the maximum daily temperature could reach 30 c in winter the day night lengths vary from 10 h and 24 min to 13 h and 54 min the soil under the two cultivation systems is classified as rhodic haplodux the minimum and maximum daily temperatures and daily rainfalls were obtained by agritempo http www agritempo gov br light microclimate of yerba mate cultivated in monoculture can be characterized by an incident photosynthetically active radiation par reduction of about 10 38 on leaves of tips compared to an open area in the agroforestry system only 2 10 of incident par reached yerba mate leaves compared to the open area moreover leaf temperatures were contrasting between the two cultivation systems rakocevic et al 2008 during the day of the hottest months leaf temperatures were 5 9 c lower in the agroforestry system compared to sun exposed leaves in monoculture in contrast in winter the leaves of plants in the agroforestry system had a minimum temperature about 2 4 c higher than in monoculture in the early morning and end of afternoon matsunaga et al 2014 in yerba mate all axes are equivalent with respect to their orientation and phyllotactic angles there is one lateral bud in the axil of each leaf in yerba mate phyllotaxy is spiral and constant 2 5 between two adjacent leaves rakocevic et al 2011 flowers and fruits develop in axillary positions along branches the lateral branches are grouped before scars of very short internodes which separate annual shoots into successive gus during the experiment three main axes were selected on 15 trees grown in each of the two cultivation systems the number of newly emerged metamers were measured on each axis during two years of growth from june 2003 to may 2005 due to severe pruning before our experiment no preformed organs could be identified when observations started at each observation date the last metamer which leaf was separated from the apical bunch was tagged with a colored label even though the internode length and leaf area could increase after metamer labelling a metamer was considered as appeared and therefore counted with respect to its leaf emergence the lateral branches appeared immediately during parent growth unit extension but branching was not considered in the present study rakocevic et al 2012 we observed 90 main axes in total 45 in the agroforestry system and 45 in monoculture from june to august 2003 new shoots were emitted but a number of them did not survive because this survival was higher in the agroforestry system compared to the monoculture the initial data set was misbalanced plant gender could not be controlled at plantation and the genders were therefore unbalanced within each cultivation system 12 females and 33 males were observed in the agroforestry system and 30 females and 15 males in monoculture since the dates of measurement were unevenly spaced either half a month or a month between two successive measurement occasions depending on the season the measurements were converted into metamer emission rates for this the number of newly emerged metamers per month was converted into number of newly emerged metamers per two weeks in the case of an interval of a month between two successive measurement occasions the data thus consists of unevenly spaced metamer emission rate series of length 37 26 intervals of half a month and 11 intervals of a month between two successive measurement occasions it should be noted that the monthly measurement periods corresponded to the less favourable growing periods e g the austral subtropical winter and we could not expect a significant gain in information with an evenly spaced sampling every half a month during this period 2 2 growth pattern analysis typically the growth pattern of yerba mate alternates growth phases with resting phases along the two years of growth follow up we thus assumed that the growth pattern takes the form of a succession of well differentiated homogeneous phases where the distribution of the metamer emission rate does not change substantially within each phase but change markedly between growth and resting phases this growth pattern was analysed using two types of segmentation models that played complementary roles hidden semi markov chains for the asynchronous segmentation of individuals in order to highlight commonality and differences between individuals and cultivation systems multiple change point models for the synchronous segmentation of individuals in order to study the influence of climatic factors based on phases common to the individuals 2 2 1 asynchronous segmentation of individuals in growth and resting phases using hidden semi markov chains the metamer emission rate series were simply indexed by the ranks of the successive measurement occasions for the building of hidden semi markov chains and the unevenly spacing between measurement occasions were thus not considered in these models hidden semi markov chains hsmcs are two scale segmentation models see methods s1 for a formal definition in our context the alternation between growth and resting phases and their durations coarse scale are represented by a non observable semi markov chain while the metamer emission rate within a phase fine scale is represented by observation distributions attached to each state of the semi markov chain hence each state of the semi markov chain represents either a growth or a resting phase a semi markov chain is defined by three subsets of parameters initial probabilities π j j 0 j 1 to model which is the first phase occurring at the beginning of the measurement transition probabilities p i j i j 0 j 1 to model the succession of phases occupancy distributions attached to non absorbing states a state is said to be absorbing if after entering this state it is impossible to leave it to model the phase duration in number of successive measurements we used as possible parametric state occupancy distributions binomial distributions b d n p poisson distributions p d λ and negative binomial distributions nb d r p with an additional shift parameter d 1 a hsmc adds a fourth subset of parameters to the three subsets of parameters previously defined for the underlying semi markov chain observation distributions to model the metamer emission rate within a phase unimodal discrete parametric observation distributions chosen among binomial distributions b d n p poisson distributions p d λ and negative binomial distributions nb d r p with an additional shift parameter d 0 were used to model these count data since the dates of measurement were unevenly spaced either half a month or a month between two successive measurements and the state occupancies were expressed in number of successive measurements the estimated state occupancy distributions were not directly interpretable the estimated hsmc should therefore be considered as a tool to segment the metamer emission rate series in successive phases the estimated hsmc was used to compute the most probable state series for each observed series guédon 2003 this restored state series can be viewed as the optimal segmentation of the corresponding metamer emission rate series into sub series each corresponding to a given phase on the basis of the optimal segmentations of the metamer emission rate series contextual model parameters e g probability of transition between two phases or distribution of the metamer emission rate for a given phase or characteristic distributions e g probability of a phase at a given date specific to individuals grown in either the agroforestry system or monoculture were extracted renton et al 2006 in order to compare the two cultivation systems 2 2 2 synchronous segmentation of individuals using multiple change point models in order to explore the influence of the climatic factors on the growth pattern we assumed that the phases were common for the different individuals and used multiple change point models for the synchronous segmentation of the metamer emission rate series of the different individuals see methods s2 for a formal definition of multiple change point models and associated statistical methods the data to be segmented thus consists of a multivariate series of length 37 the number of measurement occasions where each variable corresponds to an individual 45 individuals for the agroforestry and the monoculture sample respectively 90 individuals for the pooled sample when applying a synchronous segmentation the frequency distributions of the metamer emission rate within a given growth phase were often bimodal with a clump at zero and a separate hump around some higher value results not shown this shape can be interpreted as a consequence of the assumption of synchronous segmentation in phases which is not perfectly fulfilled since beginning and end of growth were not strictly synchronous for all the individuals nevertheless this synchronicity assumption was useful to explore the influence of the climatic factors on the growth pattern these frequency distributions can be modelled by 2 component mixture models where the first component is degenerate with a probability mass of 1 at 0 and the second component is for instance a negative binomial distribution this 2 component mixture model is thus a zero inflated negative binomial distribution π i n 0 1 π n b n d r p n 0 0 π 1 where i is the indicator function standard parametric unimodal distributions e g poisson or negative binomial were thus not appropriate in our case for synchronous segmentation we therefore chose to group the values of the observed variable metamer emission rate according to the zero inflated distribution assumption and to directly estimate probability masses for the possible categories within a given phase corresponding to the partitions of values 0 1 5 6 10 10 0 1 5 6 10 11 15 15 and 0 1 5 6 10 11 15 16 20 20 see the corresponding frequency distributions in table s1 the rather large sample sizes 45 or 90 individuals to be multiply by the number of measurement occasions within a phase justify the direct estimation of probability masses for these categories the kullback leibler divergence criterion proposed by guédon 2015 was used to determine the number of phases and different diagnostic tools were used to assess the assumption of the segmentation in stationary phases 2 2 3 relationships between phases and climatic factors the response of perennial plants to changing climatic conditions is difficult to investigate because of the difference in time scale between plant response variables every two weeks or every month in our case and daily climatic variables on the one hand and the inertia of such large scale organisms on the other hand which often entails a delayed response to change of climatic conditions we thus chose to smooth the climatic variable using symmetric smoothing filters corresponding to the probability mass function of the binomial distribution chatfield 2003 in order to remove the fluctuations of climatic variables and then simply explored the correspondence between phases synchronous for all the individuals and smoothed climatic variables 3 results 3 1 exploratory analysis the cumulative number of metamers per individual after the two years of growth was very variable both in the agroforestry system between 15 and 145 with a mean of 76 1 and a standard deviation of 31 4 and in monoculture between 56 and 198 with a mean of 112 5 and a standard deviation of 36 7 male and female metamer emission rate frequency distributions over the two years i e distribution of the metamer emission rate pooling all the successive periods between two measurements were compared between the two cultivation systems using the two tailed wilcoxon mann whitney test we did not find significant difference between males and females in both the agroforestry system 33 males and 12 females corresponding respectively to 1221 metamer emission rates with a mean of 1 76 in number of newly emerged metamers per two weeks and a standard deviation of 3 33 and 444 metamer emission rates with a mean of 1 68 and a standard deviation of 4 04 p value of 0 07 and in monoculture 15 males and 30 females corresponding respectively to 555 metamer emission rates with a mean of 2 68 and a standard deviation of 4 72 and 1110 metamer emission rates with a mean of 2 74 and a standard deviation of 4 78 p value of 0 85 we thus chose to pool males and females for further analyses the cumulative number of metamers along time shows growth phases separated by resting phases two growth units can easily be identified in the second year of growth figs 1b and 2b while the situation is more ambiguous in the first year of growth with either two short growth units separated by a resting phase or a single long growth unit in terms of growth duration figs 1a and 2a the pointwise average metamer emission rates computed for the two cultivation systems fig 3 show that the difference in growth pattern between them mainly concerned the first year of growth 3 2 identification and characterization of growth and resting phases the alternation between growth and resting phases over the two years was modelled by a 10 state hsmc composed of successive transient states followed by a final absorbing state fig 4 a state is said to be transient if after leaving this state it is impossible to return to it hence each transient state can be visited at most once in the following the effective growth phases will be referred to as growth units followed by the year index 1 or 2 and eventually the rank within the year for instance gu1 refers to the sole growth unit of the first year and gu2 2 to the second growth unit of the second year following the same principle r1 2 refers to the resting phase between the first and the second year while r1 1 refers to the resting phase between gu1 1 and gu1 2 the transition distributions estimated for all the states corresponding to growth phases long gu1 gu1 1 gu1 2 gu2 1 and gu2 2 and for the state corresponding to the resting phase r1 2 were degenerate i e p i j 1 for a single state j and p i k 0 for k j fig 4 this was the result of the iterative estimation procedure the average metamer emission rate was between 0 03 and 0 58 for resting phases while it was between 3 95 and 9 27 for growth phases the metamer emission rate series were then segmented in growth and resting phases using the estimated hsmc the posterior probabilities of the optimal segmentations i e weight of the optimal segmentation among all the possible segmentations of a given metamer emission rate series were generally high 82 above 0 05 59 above 0 1 and 26 above 0 25 to be related to a number of possible segmentations between 3 4 105 and 2 9 107 all these properties of the estimated parameters and the optimal segmentations of the metamer emission rate series confirm the proper identification of growth and resting phases using the estimated hmsc on the basis of the optimal segmentations of the metamer emission rate series various distributions were extracted for individuals grown in either the agroforestry system or monoculture the successions of phases can be compared between the two cultivation systems using the initial distribution and the non degenerate transition distributions corresponding to transition from r0 1 r1 1 and r2 1 table 1 and fig 4 they are also summarized in fig 5 as a set of probability curves the two cultivation systems differ in four aspects regarding the succession of phases 1 some agroforestry system individuals started growing at the very beginning of the observation period in june while the other agroforestry system individuals and the monoculture individuals started growing two months later in august see the initial distributions in table 1 and the probability curves at the first date of measurement in fig 5a 2 in the first year of growth there were either a single long growth phase from august to march or two rather short growth phases the first from august to mid october and the second from january to march separated by a resting phase the first situation was far more frequent in monoculture than in the agroforestry system table 1 and figs 4 and 5 3 in the first year of growth some agroforestry system individuals only have a first short growth phase table 1 and fig 4 4 in the second year of growth there were either two short growth phases the first from august to mid october and the second from mid january to march separated by a resting phase or only a first short growth phase the occurrence of the second short growth phase was more frequent in the agroforestry system individuals table 1 and fig 4 it should be noted that gu2 1 and the resting phases r1 2 r2 1 and r2 3 were shared by all the individuals whatever the cultivation system fig 4 the growth intensity within phases can be compared between the two cultivation systems using the distributions of the metamer emission rate for a given phase table 2 the mean metamer emission rate of gu1 1 and long gu1 was higher in monoculture than in the agroforestry system table 2 and fig 3 this suggests that the phyllochron time period necessary for a new metamer emission differed between the two cultivation systems the highest phyllochron was found for gu1 2 whatever the cultivation system with a mean value of about 1 6 days in monoculture and about 1 7 days in agroforestry system table 2 the metamer emission rate in gu1 2 and gu2 2 which developed in autumn did not differ between the two cultivation systems table 2 these results are confirmed by the comparison of the number of metamers of gus between the two cultivation systems and the two years of observation table 3 which shows that the phyllochron is the main determinant of the number of metamers of gus the corresponding growth periods being often rather similar between the two cultivation systems figs 4 and 5 even if some compensation phenomena may exist for instance for gu2 1 the cumulative number of metamers after one year for individuals having a long gu1 was in average about twice those for individuals not having a long gu1 89 compared to 46 5 in this case we did not distinguish agroforestry system from monoculture individuals since only 6 agroforestry system individuals among 45 had a long gu1 instead of 19 individuals among 45 for monoculture individuals this difference was propagated in the second year with some attenuation 46 8 instead of 31 8 for the mean cumulative number of metamers and 72 instead of 57 of individuals having gu2 2 there were thus a decrease and homogenization of growth between the two years 3 3 exploration of the relationships between phases and climatic factors since the phase change were rather synchronous fig 5 we chose to explore possible synchronous segmentations of individuals for each cultivation system and also globally in order to study the influence of climatic factors on the growth pattern height growth phases were selected both for the agroforestry system and monoculture using the kullback leibler divergence criterion in each cultivation system two alternative segmentations were found that differ only for the position of a single limit between two successive phases table s2 five among height of these phases were close the main differences concerned the second phase identified in the agroforestry system that was split in two phases in monoculture while the two last phases identified in the agroforestry system were merged in monoculture we thus chose to segment the pooled sample we found 10 phases synchronous for all the individuals and retained them for further investigation of the influence of climatic factors multiple change point models make two supplementary strong assumptions with respect to hsmcs i the segmentation is common to all the individuals and ii the succession of phases is deterministic meaning that there are no alternative phases at a given date of measurement as a consequence the 10 phases correspond to three possible situations with respect to the hsmc states fig 4 1 a phase directly corresponds to a single hsmc state if there are no states in parallel e g r1 2 r2 1 or r2 3 2 a phase corresponds to 2 alternative states e g long gu1 and gu1 1 3 a short phase may reflect the asynchronous beginning or end of growth of individuals the 10 synchronous phases can be described as follows for each phase the first and last dates of measurement are given in months phase 1 1 3 resting phase r0 1 for most of the individuals or beginning of growth for some agroforestry system individuals 12 among 45 phase 2 3 5 4 beginning of gu1 1 for 65 individuals among 90 or long gu1 for the other 25 individuals these proportions propagate in phases 3 and 4 phase 3 4 5 5 5 end of gu1 1 or continuation of long gu1 this continuation corresponds to slower growth with respect to phase 2 phase 4 6 10 5 resting phase r1 1 followed by a growing phase gu1 2 for 59 among 65 individuals or end of long gu1 phase 5 11 13 resting phase r1 2 phase 6 14 15 beginning of gu2 1 or end of r1 2 the asynchronous beginning of growth of individuals explains this phase phase 7 16 17 end of gu2 1 phase 8 17 5 20 resting phase r2 1 phase 9 20 5 21 5 gu2 2 for 55 individuals among 90 and beginning of r2 3 for the other individuals phase 10 22 24 resting phase r2 3 the posterior probability of the selected segmentation i e weight of the optimal segmentation among all the possible segmentations for a fixed number of phases was always high this probability was 0 29 in the agroforestry system and 0 61 in monoculture to be related to 8 3 106 possible segmentations for 8 growth phases this probability was 0 98 for the pooled sample to be related to 94 106 possible segmentations for 10 growth phases the daily minimum and maximum temperature fig 6 and cumulative rainfall fig 7 were smoothed using a symmetric smoothing filter corresponding to the probability mass function of the binomial distribution of parameters 256 and 0 5 95 of the mass concentrated on the 31 central values in order to relate these climatic factors to the phases synchronous for all the individuals the austral subtropical winter cold season indeed corresponds to resting phases r1 0 r1 2 and r2 3 while the alternation between growth and resting phases within the warm season seems to be linked to the amount of rainfall with some delayed effect as illustrated by gu2 2 which follows a marked rainfall period fig 7 the marked drought period approximately between days 175 and 210 during the warm season of the second year may explain the less frequent occurrence of gu2 2 in the monoculture individuals 33 individuals among 45 instead of 22 among 45 for monoculture fig 4 and table 1 since we expect an amplified effect of drought in monoculture compared to the agroforestry system this is in contrast with the first year of growth whose warm season was not affected by a drought period and for which only a few agroforestry systems individuals 6 among 33 did not produce a second gu among the individuals which made the resting phase r1 1 during the warm season in this case the light environment induced by the cultivation system was likely the main effect considering the non limiting effect of water availability 4 discussion 4 1 well defined growth and resting phases and plant ontogeny well defined growth and resting phases were identified in the studied two year period thanks to the segmentation based on hsmc table 2 figs 4 and 5 in both years the growth pattern was characterized by a systematic resting phase corresponding to a period with relatively cold temperatures whereas resting phases in the middle of the year were frequent but not mandatory in the first year some individuals developed a single long gu without any resting phase by contrast in the second year the resting phase in the middle of the year r2 1 was systematic thus leading to polycyclic shoots the pattern of succession of monocyclic and polycyclic shoots found in yerba mate is a phenomenon that has been previously observed in other species for instance in four year old red oak heuret et al 2003 monocyclic and polycyclic shoots could be emitted in the same growth period but the probability of monocyclic was higher in the first year also in apple tree very long monocyclic shoots were observed in an adolescent phase followed by long polycyclic shoots and thereafter monocyclic shoots during the adult phase costes and guédon 2012 generally the succession from long monocyclic to polycyclic and shorter monocyclic annual shoots can be interpreted as an ontogenetic effect leading to the progressive reduction of primary growth with tree ageing heuret et al 2006 barthélémy and caraglio 2007 in the second year small or non significant differences were observed in the gu characteristics between the two cultivation systems table 2 indicating that the endogenous rhythmic growth control would interplay with growth cessation modulated by external factors herrmann et al 2015 this interplay occurred more frequently in the agroforestry system and in younger than older shoots decreasing growth differences with years which is likely to result in progressive homogenization of shoot length with ontogeny as previously observed in other species barthélémy and caraglio 2007 4 2 variability among individuals individual asynchronism was revealed fig 5 which highlights variability among individual growth patterns this could be partly attributed to the genetic variability of the population used in this study in fact yerba mate plants were issued from the same seed collection i e from the same mother plant but the pollination was provided by numerous father plants different growth patterns depending on the family have been previously observed in other species e g pinus radiata codesido and fernadez 2009 in which families growing throughout the year can be distinguished from families growing episodically depending on rainfall the observed asynchronism among yerba mate individuals could also result from heterogeneous initial states of the shoots after severe pruning such pruning promotes traumatic reiterations a natural process that allows the plant to duplicate totally and partially its architecture oldeman 1974 but also enhance growth of the remaining unpruned axes fumey et al 2011 shoots emerging after severe pruning of large branches also called epicormics usually develop more extension than other shoots as shown in peach and almond trees dejong et al 2012 negrón et al 2014 in yerba mate they had an unknown origin epicormic or axillary bud of the previous year and this could partially explain the larger variability in the first than in the second year after pruning 4 3 effect of climatic conditions on growth rhythm in temperate regions tree phenology is synchronized yearly by cold temperatures and short photoperiod during autumn and winter and by the dormancy process which ensures appropriate timing of bud development by analogy the main shoot meristems in yerba mate stayed in resting stages r0 1 r1 2 and r2 3 over the subtropical winter probably due to minimal temperatures about 10 c fig 6 rakocevic and martim 2011 and short photoperiod about 10 h other climatic factors than temperature may be responsible for yerba mate growth rhythmicity in particular the seasonality of rainfall however in the present study the cumulative rainfall effect should be interpreted with caution fig 7 because of the difference in time scale between plant response variables every two weeks or every month in our case and daily rainfall and the often delayed and smoothed response of a perennial plant to a rainfall event in tropical rainforest water availability has been shown to have the determining role for tree growth seasonal variations wagner et al 2012 despite these limitations in modeling the relationship between rainfall and yerba mate growth we observed in the second year of growth a marked drought period that was not present in the first year this can be linked to the systematic occurrence of the resting phase at the middle of the second year growth resumption following this resting phase i e the occurrence of gu2 2 was also more frequent in the agroforestry system than in monoculture fig 4 this suggests a higher growth capacity possibly due to higher soil water storage reducing competition for available water resources in agroforestry system as previously demonstrated e g anderson et al 2009 4 4 impact of the cultivation systems and interaction with climatic conditions the number of growth units and their characteristics differed markedly in a given year between the two cultivation systems the only exception being the systematic occurrence of gu2 1 tables 1 and 2 fig 4 in the spring period a higher mean metamer emission rate was observed in monoculture than in agroforestry system despite slightly lower plant density in agroforestry than in monoculture the reduced light availability did not counterbalance the difference in metamer emission rate this difference was likely to result from the light conditions since monoculture enables more favorable light conditions and higher assimilation rate rakocevic et al 2009 with consequences on higher carbon investments matsunaga et al 2014 that could favor gu1 1 long gu1 and gu2 1 formation moreover individuals in monoculture developed more frequently a long gu1 than those in the agroforestry system 42 and 13 respectively table 1 figs 4 and 5 high light conditions in monoculture promoting uninterrupted growth in the first year is consistent with previous studies on oak and maple trees which have demonstrated that growth rhythmicity and polycyclism could be related to low light and understory conditions barnola et al 1993 verdu and climent 2007 the prolongation of primary growth leading to the development of additional metamers and leaf area and therefore increasing carbon capture and transpiration or on the contrary the entrance into a resting phase constitute a large part of tree plasticity in response to environmental conditions and their fluctuations our results suggest a fine ecological tuning of this growth cessation at both individual and plot population scales considering that resource availability and acquisition rather modulate than trigger rhythmic growth herrmann et al 2015 4 5 endogenous effects on growth rhythm differences in the cumulative number of metamers and the metamer emission rates were observed between spring and autumn growth phases that could result from competition among organs indeed the first growth units at spring developed over three months when regrowth flowering pollination and initial fruit formation occurred reproduction is expensive for plants since reproductive organs flowers and initial fruit formation represent strong sinks their growth is often negatively correlated with vegetative growth because both biological functions compete for the same resources e g koenig and knops 1998 this competition is likely to explain the difference in the mean number of metamers of the spring growth units compared with the autumn growth units table 2 the second growth phases in each year gu1 2 and gu2 2 did not differ between the individuals in the two cultivation systems table 2 their formation occurred during autumn when only vegetative growth and maintenance functions were happening finally despite that in yerba mate all axes orders have identical morphology and flowers borne laterally have little effect on the topology of the vegetative shoot system the investment in flowering and initial fruit formation could be partly responsible for the growth cessation after spring flushes similarly the competition among developing organs for resources could explain lower metamer emission rate observed in the spring growth phases than in the autumn growth phase table 2 even though the phyllochron is rarely observed in tree species it has been shown to vary among species in continuously grown banana tree about 6 6 7 1 days are necessary for a metamer emission kuttimani et al 2013 in cecropia sciadophylla about 25 metamers appear in one annual cycle zalamea et al 2008 in peach phyllochron is shown to vary between 25 to 40 h under controlled conditions davidson et al 2015 while in field grown arabica coffee seasonal fluctuations and variations are observed between axis orders rakocevic and matsunaga 2018 in rhythmic grown yerba mate relatively large variations in metamer emission rate were observed within a year from 1 5 to 1 7 days during the most rapid phase to 3 1 3 9 days during the slowest phase in monoculture and agroforestry system respectively stronger fluctuations in metamer emission rate under the agroforestry system than in monoculture are likely to contribute to individual plasticity to environmental conditions and are consistent with yerba mate being a shade tolerant species osada et al 2012 the source of variations observed in yerba mate would require further analyses possibly with observations at finer time scale in particular the within individual synchronism of axis growth with other processes such as branching or secondary growth would deserve additional observations as those made by nicolini et al 2012 4 6 statistical models for identifying phenological phases the phenological pattern of plants often takes the form of succession of well differentiated phases this has been shown in previous studies concerning contrasting species observed at various scales phenological phases were identified in multivariate series of daily growth rates of axis and selected leaves in mango tree shoots dambreville et al 2015 2017 and in univariate series of numbers of weekly emerged inflorescences in strawberry perrotte et al 2016 this study of yerba mate complements these previous studies at a coarser time scale with phenological series covering a longer time period all these studies relied on prospective measurements i e plant growth or development follow up but for coarser time scales such as year studies often relied on retrospective measurements as illustrated by the identification of growth phases in forestry contexts guédon et al 2007 chaubert pereira et al 2009 taugourdeau et al 2011 the analysis of phenological series falls into the statistical domain of longitudinal data analysis diggle et al 2002 where a relatively large number of individuals are observed repeatedly over time the specificity of phenological patterns often lies in the well defined phenological phases which require dedicated segmentation models such as hidden semi markov chains and multiple change point models for their identification these families of statistical models should be viewed as statistical frameworks which can be easily adapted to various designs in terms of types of observed variables e g categorical count or interval scale variable taking account of group effect e g genotype or cultivation system effect or time dependent effect e g climatic effect is a key issue than can be tackled using various approaches for instance a model was built for each genotype in dambreville et al 2015 and perrotte et al 2016 while a single model was built here for the two cultivation systems from which contextual parameters and characteristics were extracted for each cultivation system the thermal time was used in dambreville et al 2015 2017 to take account of the effect of temperature on growth the thermal time can be viewed as a non linear transform of the calendar time that plays the role of an implicit time varying temperature explanatory variable that modulates organ growth with reference to regression models other generalizations of hidden semi markov chains have been proposed in chaubert pereira et al 2009 and taugourdeau et al 2011 such as the incorporation of time dependent explanatory variables for modeling the influence of climatic factors and the incorporation of random effects for modeling the inter individual heterogeneity within each growth phase in conclusion well defined growth and resting phases were identified in yerba mate during a two year period after pruning despite large variability among individuals our results suggest a dormancy like period in yerba mate related to subtropical low temperatures whereas endogenous mechanisms together with competition for carbohydrate among sinks could be responsible for summer resting phase and for different metamer emission rates between spring and autumn growth phases the summer resting phase appeared to be modulated by environmental factors since higher light conditions enabled longer gu1 formation in monoculture than in the agroforestry system in the first year also the summer drought period observed in the second year led to different patterns with more frequent growth resumption after the summer rest period in agroforestry system suggesting a better water storage altogether these results confirm the role of polycyclism in plant plasticity in response to environmental conditions in this study we introduced two families of models for longitudinal data analysis hidden semi markov chains and multiple change point models which appeared robust and complementary the proposed approach enabled us to take account of the complexity of plant growth and to properly decipher the role of ontogeny light environment and climatic conditions in the growth of yerba mate it opens an avenue for future studies on other perennial plants observed at intermediate time scales between day and year in order to provide a comprehensive view of plant growth pattern

25246,habitat based distribution modelling is an established method for predicting species distributions and is necessary for many conservation and management applications cetacean habitat models have primarily been developed using data from visual surveys however numerous techniques exist for detecting animal presence and each capture a portion of the true population combining detection data gathered from multiple survey methods such as visual and acoustic surveys may lead to a more robust picture of a species distribution and ecology we compare habitat models for dall s porpoise built with visual versus acoustic survey data from a line transect survey in the california current and develop a combined model utilizing both acoustic detections and visual sightings combining acoustic and visual detections increases sample size and allows for detections under a greater range of oceanographic conditions consequently the combined model shows a modest expansion of predicted distribution of dall s porpoise compared to either single source model however this study reveals that acoustic and visual methods appear to be more complementary rather than directly additive models built with acoustic data display differences from those built with visual data different predictor variables were selected across models and the acoustic model predicts a distribution shifted slightly south of the visual distribution results from the current study show promise for incorporating acoustics into habitat models but also identify discrepancies in population sampling between these two methods that should inform future population assessments and modelling efforts keywords cetacean species distribution modelling passive acoustics monitoring habitat use line transect survey 1 introduction a foundational step in the management or conservation of any species is to understand spatial and temporal changes in distribution patterns habitat based distribution modelling is an established method for examining the biotic and abiotic variables that best characterize the observed distribution of a species redfern et al 2006 franklin 2010 bailey and thompson 2009 becker et al 2012a azzellino et al 2012 pardo et al 2015 however for highly mobile marine predators model performance and ecological understanding are often constrained by sparse distribution data numerous techniques have been developed for detecting animal presence each capturing a portion of the true population of cetaceans in an area however the majority of habitat models have been built with one source or type of distribution data e g visual or acoustic or telemetry data while combining detection data gathered from multiple survey methods may lead to a more robust picture of a species distribution and ecology the significant challenges involved in merging data types have hindered the development of combination models visual and acoustic detection methods are two of the most common methods used for studying and assessing marine mammal populations consequently there is great interest in using these data to better predict cetacean distribution and habitat use habitat models built with visual sightings data are now commonplace and have proven to be an effective management and conservation tool yen et al 2005 tynan et al 2005 redfern et al 2006 becker et al 2012a redfern et al 2013 cañadas et al 2017 models built with acoustic data have been developed more recently stafford et al 2009 hazen et al 2011 booth et al 2013 yack 2013 passive acoustic techniques have the potential to sample more consistently and supplement limited ship time mellinger et al 2007 van parijs et al 2009 klinck et al 2012 additionally for highly mobile or cryptic species passive acoustic monitoring pam may be more likely to detect animal presence than visual observation mellinger et al 2007 marques et al 2009 2013 rogers et al 2013 both visual and acoustic techniques have strengths and weaknesses that vary by species and application in many respects these two techniques are complementary visual surveys capture animals at the surface but are affected by sighting conditions and the percentage of time an individual spends at the surface while acoustic surveys capture animals under water but rely on animals vocalizing within range of the acoustic device consequently combining acoustic and visual detections in habitat models is expected to improve ecological understanding and distribution predictions yet there are numerous challenges in joining visual and acoustic data in habitat models first the number of taxa that can be identified to species using acoustics is limited marques et al 2013 second many of the species that can be identified using acoustics have vast differences in their visual and acoustic detection ranges which can complicate the interpretation matching and geographic assignment of detections finally and perhaps most significantly innate differences between acoustic and visual methods result in different acoustic and visual survey effort even for acoustic and visual surveys conducted simultaneously from the same platform this poses a significant challenge in merging these two techniques since all visual and acoustic surveys will have discrepancies in survey effort any attempt to combine or directly compare these data must aim to understand and reduce these discrepancies to date attempts to integrate visual and acoustic detection data have primarily compared visual based habitat models to acoustic detection rates and trends in the surrounding area brookes et al 2013 thompson et al 2015 rayment et al 2017 while these efforts represent important advances in comparing and contrasting the distribution patterns captured by the two detection techniques there are several methodological issues with such an approach these comparisons have used different data sets collected from different platforms and across different temporal and spatial scales for example passive acoustic presence absence data from moored devices e g cpods and marus have been compared to visual based habitat models created from aerial or ship based visual surveys brookes et al 2013 soldevilla et al 2014 since acoustic and visual detections may reflect different behaviors and habitat use patterns of cetaceans models built with different data types collected from different times and places contain additional experimental variables these variables can skew model results with the multi platform experimental design providing little opportunity to determine if the results are due to diverse behavioral patterns captured by the detection methodologies or spatial and temporal variability in conditions experienced by the animals it is therefore pertinent to control for time and place in order to directly compare and combine visual and acoustic models in this study we develop and compare visual acoustic and combined habitat models built with visual and acoustic data collected simultaneously from a ship based survey in the california current ecosystem cce to our knowledge this is the first study to build an acoustic habitat model from ship board towed array data in the pacific and the first to build a combined habitat model using visual and acoustic data for any cetacean species dall s porpoise phocoenoides dalli was selected as a case study for model building and comparison dall s porpoise are found in cool temperate pelagic waters of the north pacific between 32 n and 63 n jefferson 1988 this species was selected in part because previous habitat models of dall s porpoise built with only visual data have shown consistent habitat relationships and provided validated interannual seasonal and near real time forecasts of distribution and density in the cce with which to compare initial acoustic modelling efforts forney 2000 barlow et al 2009 becker et al 2010 2012a b becker et al 2014 2016 additionally dall s porpoise regularly react to ships which can bias abundance estimates bouchet et al 1983 this reactive movement leads to artificially raised observed densities especially in rougher sea states where sighting distance is restricted and observers are less likely to spot animals before they react to the vessel bouchet et al 1983 dawson et al 2008 consequently some past visual based estimates of abundance have been restricted to beaufort sea states two or less barlow 1995 barlow and forney 2007 acoustics thus offered a promising approach the selection of dall s porpoise was also motivated by their acoustic behavior dall s porpoise produce narrow band high frequency nbhf echolocation clicks readily discernible from most species in our study region in the cce basset et al 2009 additionally the acoustic and visual detection ranges for dall s porpoise are both within the range of a single segment length used in our model construction 5 km allowing both detection types to be reliably assigned to the same geographic segment of the transect specifically the effective strip width esw or typical distance at which dall s porpoise are seen is 1 5 km barlow et al 2011 and estimates of their acoustic detection range are on the order of a few hundred meters along the main axis of the click kyhn et al 2013 finally the selection of dall s porpoise as a case study was motivated by survey design considerations many cetacean assessment surveys employ a closing mode protocol during which a ship conducting a line transect survey diverges from the trackline to estimate group size visually thereby ceasing acoustic survey effort until the ship resumes its planned trackline this approach was not used for dall s porpoise for the present study which helped minimize discrepancies in standardized trackline effort between visual and acoustic survey methods the aims of this study are to directly compare visual and acoustic habitat models of dall s porpoise in the california current ecosystem and to trial a methodology for the combination of visual and acoustic survey data in a single model in doing so we explore the contribution of each of these data types in capturing the species distribution these aims are driven by the hypothesis that more distribution data produces models with more predictive power the following specific objectives guide this study 1 build a habitat model with visual detections for dall s porpoise in the cce using the same methodology that has been established by previous studies using visual detections 2 build a habitat model with acoustic detections for dall s porpoise in the cce using the same methodology employed for the visual model in this study 3 compare the models built with acoustic and visual detections 4 build a single habitat model combining visual and acoustic detections 5 compare the combined model to the two single stream models in developing the methodology for combining visual and acoustic data in habitat models we identify key research that is needed to improve this approach 2 methods 2 1 field methods acoustic and visual data were collected as part of the orcawale oregon california washington line transect and ecosystem survey conducted on the noaa r v mcarthur ii from july 28 to november 30 2008 the survey area encompassed waters off the us west coast out to 555 km 300 nmi from shore the line transect survey followed a regular grid pattern fig 1 a at a speed of 18 5 km h 10 knots dedicated marine mammal observers collected cetacean sighting data from the ship s flying bridge observation height 15 24 m along all transects observers rotated between 3 stations with the left and right observers using 25 150 mounted binoculars and the central observer searching with the naked eye or occasionally hand held binoculars for all marine mammal sightings the time position distance and bearing from ship species identification group composition and group size were recorded a five element hydrophone array was towed approximately 300 m from the stern of the ship at a depth of 4 8 m during daylight hours to detect echolocation clicks barlow et al 2010 three high frequency hydrophones were encased in an oil filled array reson tc4013 hydrophones with a frequency response of 1 5 150 khz 3 db with a sensitivity of 170 db re 1 v μpa after 40 db pre amplification hydrophones 1 and 2 were spaced 30 cm apart and hydrophone 3 was 200 cm from hydrophone 2 rainbow click software international fund for animal welfare ifaw gillespie and leaper 1996 was used to record any high frequency detections logger 2000 software ifaw was used with rainbow click to record gps locations and plot detected clicks of possible porpoise on a real time spectrographic display that was monitored continuously the array was monitored aurally and visually for cetacean vocalizations from a real time spectrographic display for a total of 762 h during 11 465 km of survey trackline data from the high frequency hydrophones were digitized at a sampling rate of 480 khz using a national instruments usb 6251 soundcard and were recorded to hard disk for later post processing to detect and classify dall s porpoise detections used in model building all of the data files from the cruise were reviewed manually in post processing visual review of click detections five criteria were assessed in rainbow click including 1 wave form 2 power spectrum and peak frequency 3 time frequency structure as viewed through a wigner ville transformation plot 4 number of clicks and 5 ability to localize clicks based on the convergence of bearing angles a wigner plot is a quadratic time frequency representation qtfr used to analyze the time frequency structure of broadband cetacean clicks preis and georgopoulos 1999 detections with 5 or more clicks clear track patterns i e some clicks were not along the beam a clean wave form a peak frequency between 129 and 137 khz and a wigner plot with a strong single energy peak were classified as definite fig s1 detections meeting these criteria but with only three or four clicks in a series were labeled as probable if the detection had only two clicks in a series but all other characteristics were shared with the probable assessment then it was categorized as possible at sea oceanographic data collection included sea surface temperature sst salinity sss mixed layer depth mld here defined as the depth at which temperature is 0 5 c less than the surface temperature chlorophyll concentration chl and beaufort sea state sst and sss were collected continuously at 0 5 to 2 min intervals using a thermosalinograph sensor mounted at a depth of 3 m and averaged over 5 km intervals mld was measured by expendable bathythermographs xbts deployed five times a day and conductivity temperature depth ctd casts conducted every evening surface chlorophyll concentration chl mg m 3 was measured 3 5 times per day using ctd surface water samples and bucket water samples barlow et al 2010 chl values were log transformed prior to analyses mld and chl measurements were interpolated to create continuous spatial grids of the oceanographic data with ordinary kriging using the arcgis geostatistical analyst tool version 10 1 esri inc in addition to these habitat variables collected in the field data on sea floor depth and distance from shore were obtained from etopo2 a 2 min global relief data set u s department of commerce 2006 and extracted using arcgis spatial analyst the full suite of potential predictor variables included sst sss chl log transformed beaufort sea state mld depth and distance from shore 2 2 habitat modelling the overall modelling approach is schematically outlined in fig 2 in preparation for model building both the acoustic and visual survey data were divided into approximately 5 km segments of continuous effort following becker et al 2010 to create two distinct effort databases the visual database was later used as the foundation to construct the combined database see below fig 2 the acoustic database includes 2361 segments while the visual database includes 2556 effort segments the on effort segments vary between these two methods for multiple reasons for example sea state conditions above beaufort 5 typically necessitated visual observers to go off effort consequently the visual database includes segments in beaufort conditions 0 5 while the acoustic database includes segments in conditions 0 6 additionally acoustic equipment status and personnel coverage sometimes necessitated that acoustics was off effort finally when the visual team was in closing mode and diverged from the trackline acoustics was off effort the interpolated mld chl depth distance from shore or averaged sst sss beaufort habitat variables were then associated with segment midpoints in each database using arcgis student s t tests were used to compare oceanographic conditions during acoustic and visual detections porpoise encounters either visual sightings or acoustic detections were assigned to the segment on which they were detected porpoise sighting data were truncated at 3 km range e g excluded from analyses if they were farther from the trackline than an established truncation distance for consistency with species specific effective strip width estimates used in previous modelling efforts barlow et al 2011 since we are currently unable to determine the number of individual dall s porpoises vocalizing in an acoustic detection event we used these two data sets to create models of encounter rate number of sightings detections per segment rather than density all on effort transect segments regardless of whether or not they contained sightings or detections were included in the databases for model building as described in previous publications detailing encounter rate modelling barlow et al 2009 in order to build the combined database two major methodological concerns required consideration the first was the spatial and temporal discrepancy in effort between the acoustic and visual surveys while the shared platform and concurrent surveys largely aligned these methods the slight differences in active status of each detection team created some differences in on effort segments this was addressed by only using segments for which both visual and acoustic teams were on effort in our combined database fig 2 although this reduced the number of distinct detections that could be used in model building this approach was a conservative starting point to address the challenge of merging two approaches with inherently different effort by including only the segments surveyed by both methods all spatial and temporal variability in habitat conditions are controlled for thus enabling direct comparison of the detection methods the second concern was the possibility of double counting a single dall s porpoise detection as one visual detection and one distinct acoustic detection to address this definite acoustic detections that occurred while the visual team was on effort were cross referenced with the visual segment database the location of each definite acoustic detection was determined and since the effective strip width for dall s porpoise is 1 5 km any visual detection that was within 1 5 km of the acoustic detection was regarded as the same detection barlow et al 2011 if there was no visual sighting within the esw distance the acoustic detection was determined to be distinct and therefore an additional detection event consequently the combined database included all visual sightings some of which had also been detected acoustically as well as definite acoustic detections that had not been visually observed yet occurred while the visual team was on effort the three databases were used to construct four models the visual database was used to build one model two models were built with the acoustic database one with definite acoustic detections and one with all acoustic detections to examine the impact of less certain detections on model predictions and one model was built with the combined database i e sightings and definite on effort acoustic detections that had not been visually observed given the high number of potential predictor variables and small number of sightings detections we first conducted an exploratory analysis to identify the most significant predictor variables correlation coefficients between all predictor variables were calculated and those with r2 values 0 65 were eliminated from further analyses table s1 this cut off value was selected as it is the correlation value between distance from shore and depth which is known to be highly correlated in the cce this process resulted in a revised set of potential predictors that included sst sss depth and beaufort sea state and eliminated chlorophyll distance from shore and mld modelling methods largely follow those of becker et al 2016 with some exceptions due to the nature of our questions and the small sample size of detections contained in our single year dataset in brief generalized additive models gam hedley et al 1999 ferguson et al 2006 were developed in r v 3 2 2 r development core team 2015 using the mgcv package v 1 8 7 wood 2008 2011 to relate the number of acoustic and visual encounters of dall s porpoise per segment the response variable to the oceanographic variables beaufort sea state was included as a predictor in all models to explore the potential variable effects of sea state on detection probabilities between visual and acoustic techniques the natural logarithm of segment length was used as an offset to account for differing segment lengths degrees of freedom were limited to k 4 due to the small sample sizes of dall s porpoise detections since encounter rates are sparse count data with large numbers of zeros models were built using a log link function and quasi poisson negative binomial and tweedie error distributions were compared the latter was selected based on its suitability for zero inflated count data miller et al 2013 and on inspection of diagnostic plots of model residuals and quantiles restricted maximum likelihood reml was used to optimize the parameter estimates wood 2011 model selection was performed with automatic term selection marra and wood 2011 informed by the approximate p values of each predictor wood 2011 variables found to be non significant α 0 05 were excluded and models re fit until all variables were significant functional forms of the modeled relationships as well as the p values of each significant predictor variable were used to determine order of variable importance the best model for each data set visual definite acoustic all acoustic and combined visual and acoustic was then used to predict segment specific encounter rates these predicted encounter rates were interpolated to the entire cce study area by empirical bayesian kriging using the arcgis geostatistical analyst tool to create predicted distributions at 5 km2 resolution from a 10 km 10 km regular grid with power semivariogram overlap factor 1 the final distribution maps for the models thus provide predicted encounter rates across the cce for the summer fall of 2008 sightings and acoustic detections were overlaid on these prediction grids to allow for comparison of the model predictions and observations barlow et al 2009 becker et al 2010 2012a 2012b 2016 forney et al 2012 3 results during the 2008 survey there were 79 on effort sightings of dall s porpoise post processing of acoustic data resulted in 44 on effort detections with 28 definite 10 probable and 6 possible detections ten of the 28 definite dall s porpoise acoustic detections were also recorded as visual detections the combined visual and acoustic database was composed of the 79 sightings and the 18 definite acoustic detections that were not sighted both visual and acoustic detections of dall s porpoise were more common nearshore and north of 38 n the oceanographic conditions differed between sightings n 79 and acoustic detections n 44 the median beaufort sea state throughout the cruise was 4 and both sightings and acoustic detections were made frequently in this sea state however the mean beaufort sea state varied significantly between visual and acoustic detections t 5 2 df 97 5 p 0 0001 numerous sightings were made in calm sea states beaufort 1 3 avg 2 9 1 2 while acoustic detections were more frequent in sea states 4 and 5 avg 4 0 0 8 fig 3 additionally acoustic detections were made in significantly more saline t 3 3 df 77 7 p 0 001 and less stratified waters t 4 1 df 46 7 p 0 0001 table 1 there were also regional differences between acoustic and visual detections table 2 eighty percent of sightings occurred in the northern half of the study area regions 1 4 while acoustic detections were more geographically spread with 38 of detections made in the southern half of the cce regions 5 8 most of the encounters that were acoustically detected but not visually observed were in offshore northern waters regions 1 3 3 1 selected habitat predictor variables visual models the best fit model for dall s porpoise visual encounter rates included sst beaufort sss and depth fig 4 a sightings declined steeply in waters warmer than 16 c and showed a gradual decline with increasing salinity sightings were most common in depths of approximately 2000 3500 m and declined in rougher sea states 3 2 selected habitat predictor variables acoustic models two sets of models were built with acoustic data one using the definite acoustic detections fig 4b and one using all acoustic detections fig 4c the best definite detections model included only sst acoustic detections similar to sightings declined in waters with ssts above 16 c the best fit model for all acoustic detections of dall s porpoise included sst and depth fig 4c the functional form of the relationship between dall s porpoise acoustic detections and sst in the all detections model displayed a slightly more linear decline with increasing temperature compared to the visual model the all acoustic detections model displayed a slight decline in detections from deep to shallow waters in contrast to the visual models which showed a decline in detections in deep waters 4000 m and a peak in detections between 2500 and 3000 m 3 3 selected habitat predictor variables combined visual acoustic models the best fit model for dall s porpoise combined encounters visual and definite acoustic encounters not detected visually included sst beaufort sss and depth fig 4d these were the same variables as those included in the best visual only model which is expected given the high proportion of visual sightings in this model the functional forms of the relationships between dall s porpoise encounters and these predictor variables were also similar to those displayed in the visual only model 3 4 predicted distributions inspection of the encounter rate maps show that visual and acoustic models resulted in different predicted distributions of dall s porpoise fig 5 the visual model predicted high encounter rates off washington and oregon extending into northern california waters fig 5a in contrast to the visual predictions highest encounter predictions from the acoustic models are concentrated further south the model built with all acoustic detections fig 5d predicted density hotspots in the waters just north of san francisco while the definite acoustic detections model predicted a more coastal distribution from central california to the northern extent of the study area fig 5c the area of high encounters off washington predicted by both the visual and definite acoustic detections models was missed by the all acoustic detections model the combined model predicted distribution fig 5b was similar to that of the visual model but with additional distribution hotspots predicted off central california 4 discussion the aims of this study are to directly compare visual and acoustic habitat models of dall s porpoise and trial a methodology for the combination of visual and acoustic detections in a single model these aims are driven by the hypothesis that more distribution data produces models with more predictive power and therefore developing such a methodology could enhance understanding for numerous species for which passive acoustic data has been or will be collected in the previous sections we have developed a methodology for a combined habitat model for dall s porpoise with the resulting model displaying a modest expansion of the predicted distribution compared to either of the single stream models yet the process of developing the combined model revealed that acoustic and visual methodologies while complementary may not be simply additive the current study highlights discrepancies in population sampling between visual and acoustic methods that can help identify the strengths and limitations of future population assessments and modelling efforts 4 1 differences between acoustic and visual models predicted distributions the acoustic and visual sets of models developed in this study produce different predicted distributions for dall s porpoise in the cce one of the most important predictor variables in the visual model is beaufort sea state yet it is absent from the acoustic only models this is consistent with previous studies detailing the challenges in surveying dall s porpoise visually barlow 1995 barlow et al 2001 barlow and forney 2007 dawson et al 2008 sea surface temperature is a primary predictor variable included in the visual model and in both the acoustic models this also agrees with past habitat models of dall s porpoise in the cce which have consistently predicted dall s porpoise in cool waters the visual model and the acoustic built with all acoustic detections included depth but the acoustic model built with definite acoustic detections did not this is likely due to the smaller number of definite acoustic detections and their more limited depth range the visual model also included sss which was not included in either of the acoustic models examination of the oceanographic conditions present during detections show there were significant differences in sss and mld between acoustic detections and visual sightings table 1 the discrepancies that exist between the models built with visual and acoustic data are likely due to three primary factors the inherent differences in their detection capabilities the sample size of detections utilized in each model and the species behavior captured by each detection method the differences in detection capabilities between the two methods stem from multiple sources first as was mentioned in the methods the esw for dall s porpoise varies between acoustics and visuals the difference between these two methods for dall s porpoise 1 5 km for visuals and 0 5 km for acoustics is smaller than for many species but this inherent discrepancy in esw results in slightly different surveyed areas second since visual observations are restricted to surfacing animals sightings are affected by beaufort sea state barlow et al 2001 barlow and forney 2007 most of the 2008 cruise was characterized by a beaufort sea state of 4 5 fig 3 yet the mean sea state during visual sightings was less than 3 table 1 as to be expected beaufort had less of an impact on acoustics the distribution of acoustic detections relative to beaufort sea state is more similar to the distribution of the cruise conditions with the majority of detections made in sea states of beaufort 4 and 5 fig 3 the mean sea state during encounters which were acoustically detected but not visually observed was 4 25 additionally the 2008 orcawale cruise was conducted from north to south beginning off washington in the late summer and surveying off southern california in the late fall this cruise plan was designed to capture as calm weather as possible in the northern latitudes however in doing so the southern regions of the study area were surveyed during the fall months this latitudinal and seasonal gradient likely introduced a regional difference in detection likelihood for visual effort but not for acoustic effort as a result the predicted distributions from the acoustic and combined models are elevated over the visual model in the southern half of the study area acoustic models are based on a limited sample size compared to the visual model however part of the interest in developing the acoustic models is to compare them to models built with more extensive datasets to evaluate the potential of data limited models whether such data limitation results from infrequent species encounters restricted acoustic detection distance limited temporal coverage or a combination of factors given the interest in passive acoustic detections for cryptic and poorly understood species sample size constraints are likely to be a recurring challenge in acoustic based approaches indeed calculations of explained deviance for models in the present study suggests that a smaller sample size reduces the predictive performance of acoustic based models table s2 however comparisons of the predicted distribution from this study to multi year and methodologically similar models of dall s porpoise distribution developed from previous studies becker et al 2016 show that the current models predict a similar overall distribution pattern fig s2 for example examination of the overlap between detections and predictions shows that the model built with definite acoustic detections fig 5c has some areas of high predicted density devoid of detections yet these coastal areas of predicted density match those observed in the multi year model suggesting that despite small sample size the definite acoustic model still captures the species habitat relationships for some species that are understudied and difficult to survey visually the insight provided by the definite acoustic model presented here may substantially increase understanding of species distribution patterns the final primary factor driving the discrepancies between the visual and acoustic models and predicted distributions is the behavior captured by the two detection methods though little is known about dall s porpoise acoustic behavior or regularity of vocalizations echolocation clicks are typically produced for locating prey kyhn et al 2013 if acoustic detections are mostly from foraging animals many of these individuals may be diving at the time of detection which would cause them to be missed by the visual observers in the present study dall s porpoise were acoustically detected in waters with greater mlds compared to the waters in which they were sighted dall s porpoise are known to feed on mesopelagic fish and cephalopods fiscus and kajimura 1980 ohizumi et al 2003 okamoto et al 2010 if dall s porpoise feed at or below the mixed layer they would be less likely to be visually sighted at the surface conversely though they are believed to be frequent echolocators there were many visual sightings that were not acoustically detected during this cruise this could have resulted from visual detections outside the range of acoustics e g past 500 m from the array alternatively if dall s porpoise are not acoustically active during periods of travel or other non foraging behavior acoustic methods would only sample certain behavioral states behavior may also result in perceived regional or habitat differences between acoustic and visual models williamson et al 2017 found that visual and acoustic surveys indicated different primary habitat areas for harbor porpoise in the moray firth acoustic methods revealed harbor porpoise occupied muddy bottom habitats at night while visual surveys found they occupied sandy bottom habitats during the day additionally it has been hypothesized that dall s porpoise may feed primarily at night and therefore if the species is more vocally active at night acoustic surveys during daylight hours may significantly underestimate species presence amano et al 1998 behavioral context for vocalizations is therefore valuable for interpretations of distributions determined through acoustic detections and for the development of models using a combination of acoustic and visual detection data 4 2 combined model predicted distribution the most significant challenge in combining and comparing detection data types in habitat models is the difference in survey effort between data collection methods to combine acoustic and visual methods effort must be standardized in the combined model in this study this was accomplished by collecting visual and acoustic data simultaneously from the same platform and by including detections made while both teams were on effort the visual team was off effort in beaufort sea states above 5 while acoustic effort continued in higher sea states therefore potential acoustic detections made in sea states higher than 5 were not included in the model in the current study this methodological step did not impact our final combined database as there were no acoustic detections in beaufort sea state 6 however this may not be the case for all species the exclusion of detections made in rough seas and acoustic detections that were identified as duplications of the visual sightings may substantially discount the advantage of acoustic techniques and render acoustic modelling efforts incomplete since the difference between acoustic and visual detection parameters will vary across species and platforms the approaches used in this study may not be relevant for all combined models future research will require species and platform specific considerations thus developing additional approaches to reconcile differences in effort across detection methods requires further research attention the current study is an initial attempt at merging these disparate methods and the first step in a larger effort by the us noaa fisheries science centers to refine the use of passive acoustic data in cetacean population assessments starting with simultaneously collected data from a single shipboard survey enables a more direct comparison between acoustic visual and combined models than previously published multi platform studies this initial trial of a combined model increases the sample size of detections by 23 over the visual only model and allows for detections under a greater range of conditions and habitats table 1 fig 4 the same predictor variables were included in the combined and visual models but the addition of acoustic detections in the combined model reduces the importance of beaufort in the model inferred from predictor variable p values between the two models the resulting predicted distribution includes regions previously absent from the visual prediction map however given the discrepancies between visual and acoustic models discussed above we posit that these two methods are not directly additive the two techniques likely capture multiple behavioral states of a target species both at the surface and at depth e g traveling and feeding and while this may add more data points to a population assessment they may not all be governed by the same ecological processes the behavioral and ecological differences underlying acoustic and visual detection methods will require both species and platform specific consideration in future studies combining these techniques 4 3 future directions both the comparison and combination of visual and acoustic methods offer insights that can direct additional research and improve future studies incorporating acoustic data into habitat distribution models first the differences in distribution predicted by the model built with all acoustic detections and the model built with definite acoustic detections highlight the importance of accurate acoustic detections while unlikely some of the possible and probable dall s detections may have been high frequency noises resulting from ship operations turbulence or array position or a misclassified alternative species there are three other species in the study area that produce similarly high frequency sounds and must be considered as possible candidates for misclassification roch et al 2007 harbor porpoise are found in the california current barlow 1995 and produce very similar echo location clicks kastelein et al 2002 kyhn et al 2013 however their distribution is largely limited to shelf waters less than 60 m in depth carretta et al 2001 where towed hydrophone data were not collected during this survey while there is the potential for geographic overlap it is likely low due to the current survey design additionally kyhn et al 2013 found that harbor porpoise just north of our study area in british columbia are distinguishable from dall s porpoise in their peak frequency with dall s porpoise clicks falling below 139 khz while harbor porpoise clicks were shifted slightly higher centered at 141 khz pygmy and dwarf sperm whales kogia breviceps and k sima are also found in the study area and produce echolocation clicks with frequencies higher than 100 khz madsen et al 2005 current research indicates that signals from kogia spp may be distinguishable from dall s porpoise merkens et al 2015 however there are little published data on the species the observations that do exist from both published studies and very recent field work in the california current and hawaiian islands report peak frequencies ranging from 125 to 129 khz lower than dall s porpoise vocalizations marten 2000 merkens pers comm 2016 barlow pers comm 2016 in addition to differences in vocalizations the abundance of kogia in the region is estimated to be an order of magnitude lower than dall s porpoise rendering the potential for misassignment 10 or less of classified dall s detections the potential for confounding species or noises should be considered in modelling approaches developed with acoustic data just as visual models only utilize sightings that are confirmed to species acoustic models should only utilize the most rigorous detections of the target species further research on acoustic detection and classification at the species specific level is needed to improve future acoustic and combination models and expand the diversity of species that can be included in such models one of the most significant limitations of acoustic based models is group size uncertainty and therefore the ability to estimate density however the field of density estimation based on passive acoustic data is expanding rapidly and for some species and platforms density models built with acoustic detections may be possible e g beaked whales and fixed location sensors marques et al 2009 2013 küsel et al 2011 department of the navy 2015 density estimation also requires reliable and species specific truncation distance to determine the effective area surveyed for example the high frequency of dall s porpoise calls and resulting high attenuation reduce the acoustic detection distance of this species and ultimately limit the number of detections that may be available for modelling while this can pose sample size constraints it allows for accurate linking of a detection and the proximate habitat characteristics species with long range vocalizations e g sperm whales and blue whales may present challenges in accurately modelling species habitat relationships given the broad spatial scale across which these species could be detected further research is needed on species specific detection distance and vocalization rates similar to the body of work that has established trackline detection probabilities and effective strip width for cetacean species during visual line transect surveys barlow et al 2001 2011 5 conclusion we selected a well studied species to develop habitat models built with acoustic data and a combination of visual and acoustic data the process of building multiple models from a single shipboard survey allowed for a more direct inspection of the consistency of these two methods in capturing dall s porpoise distribution the combined model of dall s porpoise shows promise for future efforts combining visual and acoustic data into cetacean habitat models however for this species the two methodologies appear to be more complementary

25246,habitat based distribution modelling is an established method for predicting species distributions and is necessary for many conservation and management applications cetacean habitat models have primarily been developed using data from visual surveys however numerous techniques exist for detecting animal presence and each capture a portion of the true population combining detection data gathered from multiple survey methods such as visual and acoustic surveys may lead to a more robust picture of a species distribution and ecology we compare habitat models for dall s porpoise built with visual versus acoustic survey data from a line transect survey in the california current and develop a combined model utilizing both acoustic detections and visual sightings combining acoustic and visual detections increases sample size and allows for detections under a greater range of oceanographic conditions consequently the combined model shows a modest expansion of predicted distribution of dall s porpoise compared to either single source model however this study reveals that acoustic and visual methods appear to be more complementary rather than directly additive models built with acoustic data display differences from those built with visual data different predictor variables were selected across models and the acoustic model predicts a distribution shifted slightly south of the visual distribution results from the current study show promise for incorporating acoustics into habitat models but also identify discrepancies in population sampling between these two methods that should inform future population assessments and modelling efforts keywords cetacean species distribution modelling passive acoustics monitoring habitat use line transect survey 1 introduction a foundational step in the management or conservation of any species is to understand spatial and temporal changes in distribution patterns habitat based distribution modelling is an established method for examining the biotic and abiotic variables that best characterize the observed distribution of a species redfern et al 2006 franklin 2010 bailey and thompson 2009 becker et al 2012a azzellino et al 2012 pardo et al 2015 however for highly mobile marine predators model performance and ecological understanding are often constrained by sparse distribution data numerous techniques have been developed for detecting animal presence each capturing a portion of the true population of cetaceans in an area however the majority of habitat models have been built with one source or type of distribution data e g visual or acoustic or telemetry data while combining detection data gathered from multiple survey methods may lead to a more robust picture of a species distribution and ecology the significant challenges involved in merging data types have hindered the development of combination models visual and acoustic detection methods are two of the most common methods used for studying and assessing marine mammal populations consequently there is great interest in using these data to better predict cetacean distribution and habitat use habitat models built with visual sightings data are now commonplace and have proven to be an effective management and conservation tool yen et al 2005 tynan et al 2005 redfern et al 2006 becker et al 2012a redfern et al 2013 cañadas et al 2017 models built with acoustic data have been developed more recently stafford et al 2009 hazen et al 2011 booth et al 2013 yack 2013 passive acoustic techniques have the potential to sample more consistently and supplement limited ship time mellinger et al 2007 van parijs et al 2009 klinck et al 2012 additionally for highly mobile or cryptic species passive acoustic monitoring pam may be more likely to detect animal presence than visual observation mellinger et al 2007 marques et al 2009 2013 rogers et al 2013 both visual and acoustic techniques have strengths and weaknesses that vary by species and application in many respects these two techniques are complementary visual surveys capture animals at the surface but are affected by sighting conditions and the percentage of time an individual spends at the surface while acoustic surveys capture animals under water but rely on animals vocalizing within range of the acoustic device consequently combining acoustic and visual detections in habitat models is expected to improve ecological understanding and distribution predictions yet there are numerous challenges in joining visual and acoustic data in habitat models first the number of taxa that can be identified to species using acoustics is limited marques et al 2013 second many of the species that can be identified using acoustics have vast differences in their visual and acoustic detection ranges which can complicate the interpretation matching and geographic assignment of detections finally and perhaps most significantly innate differences between acoustic and visual methods result in different acoustic and visual survey effort even for acoustic and visual surveys conducted simultaneously from the same platform this poses a significant challenge in merging these two techniques since all visual and acoustic surveys will have discrepancies in survey effort any attempt to combine or directly compare these data must aim to understand and reduce these discrepancies to date attempts to integrate visual and acoustic detection data have primarily compared visual based habitat models to acoustic detection rates and trends in the surrounding area brookes et al 2013 thompson et al 2015 rayment et al 2017 while these efforts represent important advances in comparing and contrasting the distribution patterns captured by the two detection techniques there are several methodological issues with such an approach these comparisons have used different data sets collected from different platforms and across different temporal and spatial scales for example passive acoustic presence absence data from moored devices e g cpods and marus have been compared to visual based habitat models created from aerial or ship based visual surveys brookes et al 2013 soldevilla et al 2014 since acoustic and visual detections may reflect different behaviors and habitat use patterns of cetaceans models built with different data types collected from different times and places contain additional experimental variables these variables can skew model results with the multi platform experimental design providing little opportunity to determine if the results are due to diverse behavioral patterns captured by the detection methodologies or spatial and temporal variability in conditions experienced by the animals it is therefore pertinent to control for time and place in order to directly compare and combine visual and acoustic models in this study we develop and compare visual acoustic and combined habitat models built with visual and acoustic data collected simultaneously from a ship based survey in the california current ecosystem cce to our knowledge this is the first study to build an acoustic habitat model from ship board towed array data in the pacific and the first to build a combined habitat model using visual and acoustic data for any cetacean species dall s porpoise phocoenoides dalli was selected as a case study for model building and comparison dall s porpoise are found in cool temperate pelagic waters of the north pacific between 32 n and 63 n jefferson 1988 this species was selected in part because previous habitat models of dall s porpoise built with only visual data have shown consistent habitat relationships and provided validated interannual seasonal and near real time forecasts of distribution and density in the cce with which to compare initial acoustic modelling efforts forney 2000 barlow et al 2009 becker et al 2010 2012a b becker et al 2014 2016 additionally dall s porpoise regularly react to ships which can bias abundance estimates bouchet et al 1983 this reactive movement leads to artificially raised observed densities especially in rougher sea states where sighting distance is restricted and observers are less likely to spot animals before they react to the vessel bouchet et al 1983 dawson et al 2008 consequently some past visual based estimates of abundance have been restricted to beaufort sea states two or less barlow 1995 barlow and forney 2007 acoustics thus offered a promising approach the selection of dall s porpoise was also motivated by their acoustic behavior dall s porpoise produce narrow band high frequency nbhf echolocation clicks readily discernible from most species in our study region in the cce basset et al 2009 additionally the acoustic and visual detection ranges for dall s porpoise are both within the range of a single segment length used in our model construction 5 km allowing both detection types to be reliably assigned to the same geographic segment of the transect specifically the effective strip width esw or typical distance at which dall s porpoise are seen is 1 5 km barlow et al 2011 and estimates of their acoustic detection range are on the order of a few hundred meters along the main axis of the click kyhn et al 2013 finally the selection of dall s porpoise as a case study was motivated by survey design considerations many cetacean assessment surveys employ a closing mode protocol during which a ship conducting a line transect survey diverges from the trackline to estimate group size visually thereby ceasing acoustic survey effort until the ship resumes its planned trackline this approach was not used for dall s porpoise for the present study which helped minimize discrepancies in standardized trackline effort between visual and acoustic survey methods the aims of this study are to directly compare visual and acoustic habitat models of dall s porpoise in the california current ecosystem and to trial a methodology for the combination of visual and acoustic survey data in a single model in doing so we explore the contribution of each of these data types in capturing the species distribution these aims are driven by the hypothesis that more distribution data produces models with more predictive power the following specific objectives guide this study 1 build a habitat model with visual detections for dall s porpoise in the cce using the same methodology that has been established by previous studies using visual detections 2 build a habitat model with acoustic detections for dall s porpoise in the cce using the same methodology employed for the visual model in this study 3 compare the models built with acoustic and visual detections 4 build a single habitat model combining visual and acoustic detections 5 compare the combined model to the two single stream models in developing the methodology for combining visual and acoustic data in habitat models we identify key research that is needed to improve this approach 2 methods 2 1 field methods acoustic and visual data were collected as part of the orcawale oregon california washington line transect and ecosystem survey conducted on the noaa r v mcarthur ii from july 28 to november 30 2008 the survey area encompassed waters off the us west coast out to 555 km 300 nmi from shore the line transect survey followed a regular grid pattern fig 1 a at a speed of 18 5 km h 10 knots dedicated marine mammal observers collected cetacean sighting data from the ship s flying bridge observation height 15 24 m along all transects observers rotated between 3 stations with the left and right observers using 25 150 mounted binoculars and the central observer searching with the naked eye or occasionally hand held binoculars for all marine mammal sightings the time position distance and bearing from ship species identification group composition and group size were recorded a five element hydrophone array was towed approximately 300 m from the stern of the ship at a depth of 4 8 m during daylight hours to detect echolocation clicks barlow et al 2010 three high frequency hydrophones were encased in an oil filled array reson tc4013 hydrophones with a frequency response of 1 5 150 khz 3 db with a sensitivity of 170 db re 1 v μpa after 40 db pre amplification hydrophones 1 and 2 were spaced 30 cm apart and hydrophone 3 was 200 cm from hydrophone 2 rainbow click software international fund for animal welfare ifaw gillespie and leaper 1996 was used to record any high frequency detections logger 2000 software ifaw was used with rainbow click to record gps locations and plot detected clicks of possible porpoise on a real time spectrographic display that was monitored continuously the array was monitored aurally and visually for cetacean vocalizations from a real time spectrographic display for a total of 762 h during 11 465 km of survey trackline data from the high frequency hydrophones were digitized at a sampling rate of 480 khz using a national instruments usb 6251 soundcard and were recorded to hard disk for later post processing to detect and classify dall s porpoise detections used in model building all of the data files from the cruise were reviewed manually in post processing visual review of click detections five criteria were assessed in rainbow click including 1 wave form 2 power spectrum and peak frequency 3 time frequency structure as viewed through a wigner ville transformation plot 4 number of clicks and 5 ability to localize clicks based on the convergence of bearing angles a wigner plot is a quadratic time frequency representation qtfr used to analyze the time frequency structure of broadband cetacean clicks preis and georgopoulos 1999 detections with 5 or more clicks clear track patterns i e some clicks were not along the beam a clean wave form a peak frequency between 129 and 137 khz and a wigner plot with a strong single energy peak were classified as definite fig s1 detections meeting these criteria but with only three or four clicks in a series were labeled as probable if the detection had only two clicks in a series but all other characteristics were shared with the probable assessment then it was categorized as possible at sea oceanographic data collection included sea surface temperature sst salinity sss mixed layer depth mld here defined as the depth at which temperature is 0 5 c less than the surface temperature chlorophyll concentration chl and beaufort sea state sst and sss were collected continuously at 0 5 to 2 min intervals using a thermosalinograph sensor mounted at a depth of 3 m and averaged over 5 km intervals mld was measured by expendable bathythermographs xbts deployed five times a day and conductivity temperature depth ctd casts conducted every evening surface chlorophyll concentration chl mg m 3 was measured 3 5 times per day using ctd surface water samples and bucket water samples barlow et al 2010 chl values were log transformed prior to analyses mld and chl measurements were interpolated to create continuous spatial grids of the oceanographic data with ordinary kriging using the arcgis geostatistical analyst tool version 10 1 esri inc in addition to these habitat variables collected in the field data on sea floor depth and distance from shore were obtained from etopo2 a 2 min global relief data set u s department of commerce 2006 and extracted using arcgis spatial analyst the full suite of potential predictor variables included sst sss chl log transformed beaufort sea state mld depth and distance from shore 2 2 habitat modelling the overall modelling approach is schematically outlined in fig 2 in preparation for model building both the acoustic and visual survey data were divided into approximately 5 km segments of continuous effort following becker et al 2010 to create two distinct effort databases the visual database was later used as the foundation to construct the combined database see below fig 2 the acoustic database includes 2361 segments while the visual database includes 2556 effort segments the on effort segments vary between these two methods for multiple reasons for example sea state conditions above beaufort 5 typically necessitated visual observers to go off effort consequently the visual database includes segments in beaufort conditions 0 5 while the acoustic database includes segments in conditions 0 6 additionally acoustic equipment status and personnel coverage sometimes necessitated that acoustics was off effort finally when the visual team was in closing mode and diverged from the trackline acoustics was off effort the interpolated mld chl depth distance from shore or averaged sst sss beaufort habitat variables were then associated with segment midpoints in each database using arcgis student s t tests were used to compare oceanographic conditions during acoustic and visual detections porpoise encounters either visual sightings or acoustic detections were assigned to the segment on which they were detected porpoise sighting data were truncated at 3 km range e g excluded from analyses if they were farther from the trackline than an established truncation distance for consistency with species specific effective strip width estimates used in previous modelling efforts barlow et al 2011 since we are currently unable to determine the number of individual dall s porpoises vocalizing in an acoustic detection event we used these two data sets to create models of encounter rate number of sightings detections per segment rather than density all on effort transect segments regardless of whether or not they contained sightings or detections were included in the databases for model building as described in previous publications detailing encounter rate modelling barlow et al 2009 in order to build the combined database two major methodological concerns required consideration the first was the spatial and temporal discrepancy in effort between the acoustic and visual surveys while the shared platform and concurrent surveys largely aligned these methods the slight differences in active status of each detection team created some differences in on effort segments this was addressed by only using segments for which both visual and acoustic teams were on effort in our combined database fig 2 although this reduced the number of distinct detections that could be used in model building this approach was a conservative starting point to address the challenge of merging two approaches with inherently different effort by including only the segments surveyed by both methods all spatial and temporal variability in habitat conditions are controlled for thus enabling direct comparison of the detection methods the second concern was the possibility of double counting a single dall s porpoise detection as one visual detection and one distinct acoustic detection to address this definite acoustic detections that occurred while the visual team was on effort were cross referenced with the visual segment database the location of each definite acoustic detection was determined and since the effective strip width for dall s porpoise is 1 5 km any visual detection that was within 1 5 km of the acoustic detection was regarded as the same detection barlow et al 2011 if there was no visual sighting within the esw distance the acoustic detection was determined to be distinct and therefore an additional detection event consequently the combined database included all visual sightings some of which had also been detected acoustically as well as definite acoustic detections that had not been visually observed yet occurred while the visual team was on effort the three databases were used to construct four models the visual database was used to build one model two models were built with the acoustic database one with definite acoustic detections and one with all acoustic detections to examine the impact of less certain detections on model predictions and one model was built with the combined database i e sightings and definite on effort acoustic detections that had not been visually observed given the high number of potential predictor variables and small number of sightings detections we first conducted an exploratory analysis to identify the most significant predictor variables correlation coefficients between all predictor variables were calculated and those with r2 values 0 65 were eliminated from further analyses table s1 this cut off value was selected as it is the correlation value between distance from shore and depth which is known to be highly correlated in the cce this process resulted in a revised set of potential predictors that included sst sss depth and beaufort sea state and eliminated chlorophyll distance from shore and mld modelling methods largely follow those of becker et al 2016 with some exceptions due to the nature of our questions and the small sample size of detections contained in our single year dataset in brief generalized additive models gam hedley et al 1999 ferguson et al 2006 were developed in r v 3 2 2 r development core team 2015 using the mgcv package v 1 8 7 wood 2008 2011 to relate the number of acoustic and visual encounters of dall s porpoise per segment the response variable to the oceanographic variables beaufort sea state was included as a predictor in all models to explore the potential variable effects of sea state on detection probabilities between visual and acoustic techniques the natural logarithm of segment length was used as an offset to account for differing segment lengths degrees of freedom were limited to k 4 due to the small sample sizes of dall s porpoise detections since encounter rates are sparse count data with large numbers of zeros models were built using a log link function and quasi poisson negative binomial and tweedie error distributions were compared the latter was selected based on its suitability for zero inflated count data miller et al 2013 and on inspection of diagnostic plots of model residuals and quantiles restricted maximum likelihood reml was used to optimize the parameter estimates wood 2011 model selection was performed with automatic term selection marra and wood 2011 informed by the approximate p values of each predictor wood 2011 variables found to be non significant α 0 05 were excluded and models re fit until all variables were significant functional forms of the modeled relationships as well as the p values of each significant predictor variable were used to determine order of variable importance the best model for each data set visual definite acoustic all acoustic and combined visual and acoustic was then used to predict segment specific encounter rates these predicted encounter rates were interpolated to the entire cce study area by empirical bayesian kriging using the arcgis geostatistical analyst tool to create predicted distributions at 5 km2 resolution from a 10 km 10 km regular grid with power semivariogram overlap factor 1 the final distribution maps for the models thus provide predicted encounter rates across the cce for the summer fall of 2008 sightings and acoustic detections were overlaid on these prediction grids to allow for comparison of the model predictions and observations barlow et al 2009 becker et al 2010 2012a 2012b 2016 forney et al 2012 3 results during the 2008 survey there were 79 on effort sightings of dall s porpoise post processing of acoustic data resulted in 44 on effort detections with 28 definite 10 probable and 6 possible detections ten of the 28 definite dall s porpoise acoustic detections were also recorded as visual detections the combined visual and acoustic database was composed of the 79 sightings and the 18 definite acoustic detections that were not sighted both visual and acoustic detections of dall s porpoise were more common nearshore and north of 38 n the oceanographic conditions differed between sightings n 79 and acoustic detections n 44 the median beaufort sea state throughout the cruise was 4 and both sightings and acoustic detections were made frequently in this sea state however the mean beaufort sea state varied significantly between visual and acoustic detections t 5 2 df 97 5 p 0 0001 numerous sightings were made in calm sea states beaufort 1 3 avg 2 9 1 2 while acoustic detections were more frequent in sea states 4 and 5 avg 4 0 0 8 fig 3 additionally acoustic detections were made in significantly more saline t 3 3 df 77 7 p 0 001 and less stratified waters t 4 1 df 46 7 p 0 0001 table 1 there were also regional differences between acoustic and visual detections table 2 eighty percent of sightings occurred in the northern half of the study area regions 1 4 while acoustic detections were more geographically spread with 38 of detections made in the southern half of the cce regions 5 8 most of the encounters that were acoustically detected but not visually observed were in offshore northern waters regions 1 3 3 1 selected habitat predictor variables visual models the best fit model for dall s porpoise visual encounter rates included sst beaufort sss and depth fig 4 a sightings declined steeply in waters warmer than 16 c and showed a gradual decline with increasing salinity sightings were most common in depths of approximately 2000 3500 m and declined in rougher sea states 3 2 selected habitat predictor variables acoustic models two sets of models were built with acoustic data one using the definite acoustic detections fig 4b and one using all acoustic detections fig 4c the best definite detections model included only sst acoustic detections similar to sightings declined in waters with ssts above 16 c the best fit model for all acoustic detections of dall s porpoise included sst and depth fig 4c the functional form of the relationship between dall s porpoise acoustic detections and sst in the all detections model displayed a slightly more linear decline with increasing temperature compared to the visual model the all acoustic detections model displayed a slight decline in detections from deep to shallow waters in contrast to the visual models which showed a decline in detections in deep waters 4000 m and a peak in detections between 2500 and 3000 m 3 3 selected habitat predictor variables combined visual acoustic models the best fit model for dall s porpoise combined encounters visual and definite acoustic encounters not detected visually included sst beaufort sss and depth fig 4d these were the same variables as those included in the best visual only model which is expected given the high proportion of visual sightings in this model the functional forms of the relationships between dall s porpoise encounters and these predictor variables were also similar to those displayed in the visual only model 3 4 predicted distributions inspection of the encounter rate maps show that visual and acoustic models resulted in different predicted distributions of dall s porpoise fig 5 the visual model predicted high encounter rates off washington and oregon extending into northern california waters fig 5a in contrast to the visual predictions highest encounter predictions from the acoustic models are concentrated further south the model built with all acoustic detections fig 5d predicted density hotspots in the waters just north of san francisco while the definite acoustic detections model predicted a more coastal distribution from central california to the northern extent of the study area fig 5c the area of high encounters off washington predicted by both the visual and definite acoustic detections models was missed by the all acoustic detections model the combined model predicted distribution fig 5b was similar to that of the visual model but with additional distribution hotspots predicted off central california 4 discussion the aims of this study are to directly compare visual and acoustic habitat models of dall s porpoise and trial a methodology for the combination of visual and acoustic detections in a single model these aims are driven by the hypothesis that more distribution data produces models with more predictive power and therefore developing such a methodology could enhance understanding for numerous species for which passive acoustic data has been or will be collected in the previous sections we have developed a methodology for a combined habitat model for dall s porpoise with the resulting model displaying a modest expansion of the predicted distribution compared to either of the single stream models yet the process of developing the combined model revealed that acoustic and visual methodologies while complementary may not be simply additive the current study highlights discrepancies in population sampling between visual and acoustic methods that can help identify the strengths and limitations of future population assessments and modelling efforts 4 1 differences between acoustic and visual models predicted distributions the acoustic and visual sets of models developed in this study produce different predicted distributions for dall s porpoise in the cce one of the most important predictor variables in the visual model is beaufort sea state yet it is absent from the acoustic only models this is consistent with previous studies detailing the challenges in surveying dall s porpoise visually barlow 1995 barlow et al 2001 barlow and forney 2007 dawson et al 2008 sea surface temperature is a primary predictor variable included in the visual model and in both the acoustic models this also agrees with past habitat models of dall s porpoise in the cce which have consistently predicted dall s porpoise in cool waters the visual model and the acoustic built with all acoustic detections included depth but the acoustic model built with definite acoustic detections did not this is likely due to the smaller number of definite acoustic detections and their more limited depth range the visual model also included sss which was not included in either of the acoustic models examination of the oceanographic conditions present during detections show there were significant differences in sss and mld between acoustic detections and visual sightings table 1 the discrepancies that exist between the models built with visual and acoustic data are likely due to three primary factors the inherent differences in their detection capabilities the sample size of detections utilized in each model and the species behavior captured by each detection method the differences in detection capabilities between the two methods stem from multiple sources first as was mentioned in the methods the esw for dall s porpoise varies between acoustics and visuals the difference between these two methods for dall s porpoise 1 5 km for visuals and 0 5 km for acoustics is smaller than for many species but this inherent discrepancy in esw results in slightly different surveyed areas second since visual observations are restricted to surfacing animals sightings are affected by beaufort sea state barlow et al 2001 barlow and forney 2007 most of the 2008 cruise was characterized by a beaufort sea state of 4 5 fig 3 yet the mean sea state during visual sightings was less than 3 table 1 as to be expected beaufort had less of an impact on acoustics the distribution of acoustic detections relative to beaufort sea state is more similar to the distribution of the cruise conditions with the majority of detections made in sea states of beaufort 4 and 5 fig 3 the mean sea state during encounters which were acoustically detected but not visually observed was 4 25 additionally the 2008 orcawale cruise was conducted from north to south beginning off washington in the late summer and surveying off southern california in the late fall this cruise plan was designed to capture as calm weather as possible in the northern latitudes however in doing so the southern regions of the study area were surveyed during the fall months this latitudinal and seasonal gradient likely introduced a regional difference in detection likelihood for visual effort but not for acoustic effort as a result the predicted distributions from the acoustic and combined models are elevated over the visual model in the southern half of the study area acoustic models are based on a limited sample size compared to the visual model however part of the interest in developing the acoustic models is to compare them to models built with more extensive datasets to evaluate the potential of data limited models whether such data limitation results from infrequent species encounters restricted acoustic detection distance limited temporal coverage or a combination of factors given the interest in passive acoustic detections for cryptic and poorly understood species sample size constraints are likely to be a recurring challenge in acoustic based approaches indeed calculations of explained deviance for models in the present study suggests that a smaller sample size reduces the predictive performance of acoustic based models table s2 however comparisons of the predicted distribution from this study to multi year and methodologically similar models of dall s porpoise distribution developed from previous studies becker et al 2016 show that the current models predict a similar overall distribution pattern fig s2 for example examination of the overlap between detections and predictions shows that the model built with definite acoustic detections fig 5c has some areas of high predicted density devoid of detections yet these coastal areas of predicted density match those observed in the multi year model suggesting that despite small sample size the definite acoustic model still captures the species habitat relationships for some species that are understudied and difficult to survey visually the insight provided by the definite acoustic model presented here may substantially increase understanding of species distribution patterns the final primary factor driving the discrepancies between the visual and acoustic models and predicted distributions is the behavior captured by the two detection methods though little is known about dall s porpoise acoustic behavior or regularity of vocalizations echolocation clicks are typically produced for locating prey kyhn et al 2013 if acoustic detections are mostly from foraging animals many of these individuals may be diving at the time of detection which would cause them to be missed by the visual observers in the present study dall s porpoise were acoustically detected in waters with greater mlds compared to the waters in which they were sighted dall s porpoise are known to feed on mesopelagic fish and cephalopods fiscus and kajimura 1980 ohizumi et al 2003 okamoto et al 2010 if dall s porpoise feed at or below the mixed layer they would be less likely to be visually sighted at the surface conversely though they are believed to be frequent echolocators there were many visual sightings that were not acoustically detected during this cruise this could have resulted from visual detections outside the range of acoustics e g past 500 m from the array alternatively if dall s porpoise are not acoustically active during periods of travel or other non foraging behavior acoustic methods would only sample certain behavioral states behavior may also result in perceived regional or habitat differences between acoustic and visual models williamson et al 2017 found that visual and acoustic surveys indicated different primary habitat areas for harbor porpoise in the moray firth acoustic methods revealed harbor porpoise occupied muddy bottom habitats at night while visual surveys found they occupied sandy bottom habitats during the day additionally it has been hypothesized that dall s porpoise may feed primarily at night and therefore if the species is more vocally active at night acoustic surveys during daylight hours may significantly underestimate species presence amano et al 1998 behavioral context for vocalizations is therefore valuable for interpretations of distributions determined through acoustic detections and for the development of models using a combination of acoustic and visual detection data 4 2 combined model predicted distribution the most significant challenge in combining and comparing detection data types in habitat models is the difference in survey effort between data collection methods to combine acoustic and visual methods effort must be standardized in the combined model in this study this was accomplished by collecting visual and acoustic data simultaneously from the same platform and by including detections made while both teams were on effort the visual team was off effort in beaufort sea states above 5 while acoustic effort continued in higher sea states therefore potential acoustic detections made in sea states higher than 5 were not included in the model in the current study this methodological step did not impact our final combined database as there were no acoustic detections in beaufort sea state 6 however this may not be the case for all species the exclusion of detections made in rough seas and acoustic detections that were identified as duplications of the visual sightings may substantially discount the advantage of acoustic techniques and render acoustic modelling efforts incomplete since the difference between acoustic and visual detection parameters will vary across species and platforms the approaches used in this study may not be relevant for all combined models future research will require species and platform specific considerations thus developing additional approaches to reconcile differences in effort across detection methods requires further research attention the current study is an initial attempt at merging these disparate methods and the first step in a larger effort by the us noaa fisheries science centers to refine the use of passive acoustic data in cetacean population assessments starting with simultaneously collected data from a single shipboard survey enables a more direct comparison between acoustic visual and combined models than previously published multi platform studies this initial trial of a combined model increases the sample size of detections by 23 over the visual only model and allows for detections under a greater range of conditions and habitats table 1 fig 4 the same predictor variables were included in the combined and visual models but the addition of acoustic detections in the combined model reduces the importance of beaufort in the model inferred from predictor variable p values between the two models the resulting predicted distribution includes regions previously absent from the visual prediction map however given the discrepancies between visual and acoustic models discussed above we posit that these two methods are not directly additive the two techniques likely capture multiple behavioral states of a target species both at the surface and at depth e g traveling and feeding and while this may add more data points to a population assessment they may not all be governed by the same ecological processes the behavioral and ecological differences underlying acoustic and visual detection methods will require both species and platform specific consideration in future studies combining these techniques 4 3 future directions both the comparison and combination of visual and acoustic methods offer insights that can direct additional research and improve future studies incorporating acoustic data into habitat distribution models first the differences in distribution predicted by the model built with all acoustic detections and the model built with definite acoustic detections highlight the importance of accurate acoustic detections while unlikely some of the possible and probable dall s detections may have been high frequency noises resulting from ship operations turbulence or array position or a misclassified alternative species there are three other species in the study area that produce similarly high frequency sounds and must be considered as possible candidates for misclassification roch et al 2007 harbor porpoise are found in the california current barlow 1995 and produce very similar echo location clicks kastelein et al 2002 kyhn et al 2013 however their distribution is largely limited to shelf waters less than 60 m in depth carretta et al 2001 where towed hydrophone data were not collected during this survey while there is the potential for geographic overlap it is likely low due to the current survey design additionally kyhn et al 2013 found that harbor porpoise just north of our study area in british columbia are distinguishable from dall s porpoise in their peak frequency with dall s porpoise clicks falling below 139 khz while harbor porpoise clicks were shifted slightly higher centered at 141 khz pygmy and dwarf sperm whales kogia breviceps and k sima are also found in the study area and produce echolocation clicks with frequencies higher than 100 khz madsen et al 2005 current research indicates that signals from kogia spp may be distinguishable from dall s porpoise merkens et al 2015 however there are little published data on the species the observations that do exist from both published studies and very recent field work in the california current and hawaiian islands report peak frequencies ranging from 125 to 129 khz lower than dall s porpoise vocalizations marten 2000 merkens pers comm 2016 barlow pers comm 2016 in addition to differences in vocalizations the abundance of kogia in the region is estimated to be an order of magnitude lower than dall s porpoise rendering the potential for misassignment 10 or less of classified dall s detections the potential for confounding species or noises should be considered in modelling approaches developed with acoustic data just as visual models only utilize sightings that are confirmed to species acoustic models should only utilize the most rigorous detections of the target species further research on acoustic detection and classification at the species specific level is needed to improve future acoustic and combination models and expand the diversity of species that can be included in such models one of the most significant limitations of acoustic based models is group size uncertainty and therefore the ability to estimate density however the field of density estimation based on passive acoustic data is expanding rapidly and for some species and platforms density models built with acoustic detections may be possible e g beaked whales and fixed location sensors marques et al 2009 2013 küsel et al 2011 department of the navy 2015 density estimation also requires reliable and species specific truncation distance to determine the effective area surveyed for example the high frequency of dall s porpoise calls and resulting high attenuation reduce the acoustic detection distance of this species and ultimately limit the number of detections that may be available for modelling while this can pose sample size constraints it allows for accurate linking of a detection and the proximate habitat characteristics species with long range vocalizations e g sperm whales and blue whales may present challenges in accurately modelling species habitat relationships given the broad spatial scale across which these species could be detected further research is needed on species specific detection distance and vocalization rates similar to the body of work that has established trackline detection probabilities and effective strip width for cetacean species during visual line transect surveys barlow et al 2001 2011 5 conclusion we selected a well studied species to develop habitat models built with acoustic data and a combination of visual and acoustic data the process of building multiple models from a single shipboard survey allowed for a more direct inspection of the consistency of these two methods in capturing dall s porpoise distribution the combined model of dall s porpoise shows promise for future efforts combining visual and acoustic data into cetacean habitat models however for this species the two methodologies appear to be more complementary

25247,few studies have assessed the impact of dams on the distribution of the genetic diversity of neotropical fish species and some of them suggest that the genetic structure of fish metapopulations is not affected by damming however the effects of dams on the genetic structure of populations may hinge on the biological characteristics of the species such as homing behavior dams prevent some individuals from migrating from their feeding area to their natal spawning area constraining them to reproduce in the tributaries that are closest to the barrier and which are already being used as breeding grounds by other subpopulations in these places subpopulations may interbreed thus disrupting the overall genetic structure of the metapopulation to test this hypothesis we developed a demogenetic individual based model that simulates the impact of permeable and impermeable dams on the genetic structure of homing populations in both the long term and the short term our results support that genetic homogenization occurs among the subpopulations in the short term especially near the dam the impact of a dam on the genetic structure is also detectable in the long term 100 generations after the addition of the dam when the dam is permeable symmetrical or asymmetrical however when the barrier is not permeable the genetic differentiation among the subpopulations is reestablished in the long term our results suggest that conservation programs should be developed to avoid mitigate genetic homogenization of populations of fish that display homing behavior in the short term and to reestablish the pre dam genetic structure of these populations in the long term keywords conservation genetics dam individual based genetic model migratory fish neotropical fish

genetic diversity of populations of neotropical fish species e g barroca et al 2012 sanches et al 2012 ferreira et al 2016 pil et al 2018 most of them failed to detect genetic differentiation among populations in some of those studies the construction of the dam had happened recently ferreira et al 2016 the generation times of the fish species sampled were long sanches et al 2012 or the effective sizes of the original populations were large pil et al 2018 all these characteristics are known to delay or to impair genetic differentiation among populations wright 1931 slatkin 1995

östergren et al 2012 fig 1 a this dendritic genetic structure is directly derived from the dendritic network of rivers as subpopulations in different tributaries become genetically differentiated

studies have suggested that some freshwater species of neotropical fish present homing behavior godoy 1959 1975 batista and alves gomes 2006 godinho and kynard 2006 godinho et al 2007 2008 abreu et al 2009 pereira et al 2009 baggio 2016 duponchelle et al 2016 baggio et al unpublished thus understanding how dams affect homing fish populations is essential to the implementation of conservation programs in the neotropical region baggio 2016 and baggio et al unpublished suggested that the distribution of the genetic diversity of the pintado catfish pseudoplatystoma corruscans from the upper paraná river might reflect its homing behavior furthermore they suggested that the lack of genetic differentiation among the subpopulations of that species in the tributaries closest to the porto primavera dam may be associated with the barrier which might have promoted genetic homogenization by changing the migration pattern of the species pseudoplatystoma corruscans like other migratory neotropical fish species usually spawn in the fast waters of the tributaries the larvae and juveniles develop in flooded areas e g lagoons in the lower reaches of the tributaries and in the main channel the adults feed in those same habitats and also in reservoirs see carolsfeld et al 2003 for details when a dam is built individuals feeding in the main channel might get isolated downstream to the barrier which may prevent their migration back to their natal spawning area fig 1b as an alternative these individuals might reproduce in the closest tributaries downstream of the dam as reported for other neotropical sato et al 2005 godinho and kynard 2006 2008 antonio et al 2007 makrakis et al 2012 and temperate fish species thorstad et al 2008 this alternative behavior includes species that display homing behavior i e atlantic salmon salmo salar gerlier and roche 1998 croze 2005 hence in these tributaries individuals of distinct subpopulations those that could not reach their breeding tributaries might interbreed with individuals of the local subpopulation fig 1c the expected outcome is the genetic homogenization of the subpopulations at the tributaries that are close to the dam fig 1d interbreeding is thus expected to rapidly disrupt the genetic structure of local subpopulations echelle and connor 1989 olden et al 2004 gilman and behm 2011 at larger scales 500 to 3200 km prado et al 2017 found no genetic differentiation among populations of p corruscans and p reticulatum isolated by dams from paraná and paraguay rivers basins while pereira et al 2009 found six genetically structured populations of p corruscans separated by dams across the same basins however no study assessed the direct effect of damming on the distribution of the genetic diversity in populations upstream and downstream to the dam after the building of the barrier in order to test such hypothesis and its predictions we developed an individual based demogenetic model to simulate the evolution of the genetic structure of fish populations that present homing behavior under the presence of a dam a variety of individual based models ibms have been developed to simulate the population demogenetics of migratory fishes e g jager 2001 piou and prévost 2012 frank and baret 2013 including some that were specifically tailored to test the effect of the dendritic network of streams on the genetic structure of the studied species e g labonne et al 2008 thomaz et al 2016 landguth et al 2017 demogenetic ibms have been successfully applied to understand the genetic consequences of river fragmentation by dams on fish populations e g jager 2001 frank and baret 2013 landguth et al 2017 however as far as we know no model has tested the influence of dams on the dendritic genetic structure of fish homing subpopulations in addition the aforementioned models are typically complex models that cannot not be applied to data poor systems as those where neotropical species occur to overcome data limitations we used a simplified approach trying to balance complexity adequately by reducing the model to indispensable building blocks to understand the mechanisms under study we aimed to answer four questions with our model a can homing populations become genetically homogenized due the isolation of their spawning areas by dams b how many generations does it take for genetic homogenization to take place c what would be the impact of a dam on these populations in the long term dozen to hundred generations and in the short term 10 generations d what would be the impact of permeability the possibility of individuals dispersing through the dam on the genetic structure of these populations 2 material and methods 2 1 model description the model was written in fortran90 and their executable versions to windows linux and macintosh are available at https github com rbaggioufpr homing git model description follows the odd overview design concepts and details protocol proposed by grimm et al 2006 2010 for describing individual based models 2 1 1 purpose the model was developed to analyze the changes in the demogenetic structure that the presence of a migration barrier causes on a metapopulation of fish species that displays homing behavior while some processes are tailored to model features of neotropical fish species the modeling approach is generalizable and can be applied to other systems 2 1 2 entities state variables and scales the model represents a river network comprised by l tributaries each representing a spawning area see table 1 each tributary is characterized by its position in the river network and has a dynamic variable for the number of fish spawning in it the river network is described by its spatial configuration and carrying capacity maximum number of individuals of the metapopulation n which remain fixed over a simulation run the only dynamic state variable of the river network is the total number of fish in the system the model simulates the addition of a dam that fragments the river system into two subnetworks which are described by the same dynamic state variable and parameters as the river network entity fish are modeled at two hierarchical levels individuals and subpopulation each individual fish is characterized by its location spawning area and its genome see section 2 1 7 3 all individuals in the same spawning area form a subpopulation which is identified by an identity letter and characterized by its genetic diversity each time step generation represents one year which includes a feeding period and a reproductive period fish in neotropical rivers typically have one reproductive season per year the length of the simulation is defined by the user 2 1 3 process overview and scheduling during the first generations until ndam table 1 the model simulates the metapopulation dynamics without any migration barrier each time step fish individuals execute the following actions in the same predetermined order but fish are processed in a randomized sequence fig 2 1 fish choose a tributary to spawn in 2 fish survive or die and 3 alive fish reproduce at generation ndam damming takes place and the river network gets fragmented in two sections subnetworks by a either partially permeable or impermeable dam and fish individuals are assigned to either the upstream or downstream section of the river network this action is a punctual event that only takes place at the beginning of the time step ndam each time step after damming including time step ndam until the end of the simulation fish individuals determine first whether they disperse and move through the dam between sections if the dam is permeable or remain in the same section of the river network fish subsequently perform the three actions described for the no dam case spawning migration mortality and reproduction 2 1 4 design concepts adaptation objectives learning and prediction concepts do not apply to this model 2 1 4 1 basic principles the model is underpinned by landscape demogenetics which integrates demographic and genetics dynamics at the landscape spatial scale at the entire river network scale in this case homing behavior is the main driver of the demogenetics of the metapopulation in the case of homing species individuals go back to their natal tributary to spawn forming a subpopulation that is genetically distinct from other subpopulations as a consequence of genetic drift and natural selection density dependence operates on reproduction as spawning is precluded when the total size of the metapopulation reaches its carrying capacity 2 1 4 2 emergence the size and genetic diversity of each subpopulation and thus the demographic and genetic structure of the metapopulation emerges from the decision of the individuals on where to spawn and their capacity to disperse over the dam 2 1 4 3 sensing fish individuals know their current spawning area and sense mates and are assumed to perceive the presence of the dam and its permeability e g presence of a fish ladder 2 1 4 4 interaction individuals interact through sexual reproduction within the same tributary 2 1 4 5 stochasticity the spawning area and genome of each individual at initialization are randomly assigned whether a fish survives or dies displays a homing or straying behavior shows spawning fidelity to a non natal tributary or not and disperses over the dam or remains in the same section of the river network are all stochastic events based on probability distributions mating choice is stochastic and the loci transmitted by each parent to the offspring are randomly selected so the genotype of the offspring is a random combination of the parental genotypes dna mutation is also a stochastic event 2 1 4 6 collectives all fish that spawn in the same tributary form a distinct subpopulation subpopulation collectives emerge from the individual behaviors homing vs straying fidelity to a non natal spawning area active dispersion through dam vs residency but they do not actually affect the modeled fish in any way 2 1 4 7 observation the location spawning area and genome of each individual are recorded every generation the changes in the genetic structure are assessed through the global within subnetwork upstream or downstream to the dam and paired between two subpopulations fst index weir and cockerham 1984 weir 1996 before and after the addition of the dam global fst is the component of the genetic variation due to differences among all subpopulations within subnetwork fst is the component of the genetic variation due to differences among the subpopulations within each subnetwork the pairwise fst is the inter population level genetic variation between two subpopulations the fst is estimated as 1 f s t v 1 g σ p v 2 v 1 g σ p v 2 v 1 g σ g v 2 where σpv 2 is the variance between subpopulations and σ2 gv is the variance within subpopulations for the locus v the σ2 gv is estimated as the mean square for within populations msg 2 σ g v 2 m s g 1 i n i 1 i n i p a i 1 p a i where pai is the frequency of the allele a of the locus v in the i th subpopulation and ni is its

where pa is the frequency of the allele a of the locus v in the metapopulation global fst subnetwork within subnetwork fst and among two populations pairwise fst the fst statistics were chosen because it is one of the most widespread indexes used to test genetic differentiation among populations fst varies from zero to one zero values represent absence of genetic differentiation and non zero values represent some level of genetic differentiation see freeland and petersen 2011 for details 2 1 5 initialization at initialization the user first defines the spatial configuration of the river network number and position of tributaries a model run is initialized with n fish individuals the river system is at carrying capacity which are randomly distributed across the l tributaries spawning areas the genome of each fish is composed of a sequence of g non linked loci with binary alleles each with the alleles 0 or 1 table 1 that are randomly assigned 2 1 6 input the model does not use any input data as the environment is assumed to be homogeneous in the entire river network and constant during the whole simulation 2 1 7 submodels 2 1 7 1 spawning migration each generation individuals choose their spawning area each fish reproduces in its natal tributary every year except if it strays to another spawning area each fish has a probability m straying rate table 1 of not adopting a homing behavior and thus spawning in a tributary different from its natal tributary this resulting from the individual s inability to find its natal spawning area an individual that does not adopt homing behavior becomes a strayer the strayer continues to reproduce in the new spawning area in subsequent generations unless it decides to migrate to another tributary to reproduce we assumed that the probability that a strayer shows no spawning fidelity to the new tributary and thus selects a new spawning area is the same as the straying rate m while it could be argued that homing behavior might be stronger than the fidelity to a new non natal tributary we made this assumption because there are no empirical studies that could provide us a guidance to model such complex spawning behavior so the value of the parameter would be highly uncertain therefore in the present study m actually represents the probability that a fish spawns in a tributary different from the one where it spawned in the last reproductive season hence the decision of a fish to spawn in a different tributary is modeled as a bernoulli trial stochastic true or false event using the probability of straying m a random number from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1 is drawn for each fish and if it is lower than m then the fish spawns in a different tributary in this case the fish has an equal probability to choose any tributary independently of its past either the natal or a previous non natal tributary and present spawning locations 2 1 7 2 mortality each generation each fish challenges its survival by means of a bernoulli trial using the mortality rate d table 1 the probability of dying is independent of the fish genome there is no selection of the loci spawning area and subpopulation size therefore fish do not have a fixed life span instead mortality is modeled as a random occurrence with a fixed probability 2 1 7 3 reproduction the reproduction is sexual and the individuals can mate randomly with the other individuals that are in the same spawning area tributary for simplicity the individuals are haploid and hermaphrodites individuals are processed first as females in a randomized order each choosing randomly a fish from its same tributary which will act as a male each mating produces one new individual each individual can reproduce only twice once as a female and once as a male during each reproductive season generation however due to density dependent processes see next paragraph some individuals might not reproduce or reproduce only once the genome of each mating individual is constituted of g non linked loci table 1 with binary alleles 0 1 at each locus the offspring inherits 50 of the dna of each parent the loci are randomized and the first 50 of them are inherited from one parent and the remaining 50 of them are inherited from the other parent during reproduction mutations can happen at rate μ per locus natural selection is not modeled and the genome is a neutral marker consequently all individuals have equivalent fitness in all spawning areas new born individuals are sexually mature in the next time step generation reproduction takes place only when the total population size sum of the number of individuals of all spawning areas is smaller than the carrying capacity of the river network n table 1 that is total population size cannot grow over the carrying capacity of the entire system therefore when the carrying capacity is reached reproduction stops we assumed that density dependence should operate on population growth at the entire river network scale because homing subpopulations in neotropical rivers should explore common areas for larval development feeding and growth and consequently they should be subject to the same predation pressures and resource availability in our model the entire river network is regarded as feeding grounds so density dependence should operate at this scale after the dam is added to the simulation the carrying capacity of each section of the river network is calculated proportionally to its size see section 2 1 7 4 and density dependence operates at the subnetwork spatial scale therefore tributaries do not have individual carrying capacities and since spawning migration and mortality are stochastic processes the number of spawners may differ across tributaries 2 1 7 4 damming after ndam 1 generations a dam is added to the river network downstream of tributary b table 1 which limits dispersal migration between the feeding and spawning areas and the gene flow among subpopulations the dam divides the river network in two sections subnetworks upstream from position 1 to b and downstream from position b 1 to l since individuals are randomly distributed throughout the feeding area during the feeding season each individual can be located either upstream or downstream of the dam when it is added when the barrier is implemented the probability that an individual gets located upstream of the dam bup is proportional to the total length of the upstream subnetwork so that b u p b l the probability of being located in the downstream subnetwork bdown is likewise proportional to its total length and so b d o w n 1 b u p we assume that all tributaries have the same length so the probability of being located either upstream or downstream to the dam depends on the number of tributaries in each subnetwork the individuals that remain in the subnetwork where their current spawning area is located reproduce in the same tributary in this generation unless they decide to migrate to another tributary to reproduce following the rules explained in the spawning migration submodel on the other hand individuals that become isolated from their current spawning area by the dam either upstream or downstream reproduce in this generation in one of the two tributaries one at each margin closest to the dam with equal probability of selection this rule was implemented to mimic reproductive patterns observed in neotropical migratory fish after damming sato et al 2005 godinho and kynard 2006 2008 antonio et al 2007 makrakis et al 2012 in large neotropical rivers as modeled in this study areas of high productivity can be distributed over a large section of the river network e g the floodplain in the upper paraná river carolsfeld et al 2003 large neotropical dams are usually built in the main channel of the basin and thus both spawning and highly productive feeding areas used by fish can be found both upstream and downstream to the dam accordingly under the scenario of the fragmented metapopulation under a homogeneous environment i e uniform random distribution in the feeding area upstream and downstream to the dam the carrying capacity of each subnetwork nup and ndown is proportional to its length and the carrying capacity of the entire network n u p n b l and n d o w n n n u p the construction of the dam and subsequent redistribution of fish in the upstream and downstream subnetworks is a punctual event that takes place at the beginning of the generation ndam once the action is over the processes of dispersal though the dam see next submodel spawning migration mortality and reproduction corresponding to this generation ndam are performed 2 1 7 5 dispersal through the dam after damming individuals have the possibility to disperse through the dam one way i e asymmetrical upstream fish moving through fish ladder or asymmetrical downstream larvae and adults moving through spillways and fish ladders or both ways symmetrical permeability and reproduce in the other section of the river network the dispersal process includes both unintentional straying by homing individuals and strayers e g larvae and fish dragged by the current fish that migrate downstream and do not find the fish ladders to migrate upstream fish that migrate upstream get lost in the reservoir and do not find the fish ladders to migrate downstream and intentional straying by strayers dispersion of the fishes thus both strayers and homing individuals can disperse trough the dam since there are no empirical studies providing data to differentiate between intentional and unintentional dispersal in neotropical systems both types are modeled through a single parameter the probability of dispersion depends on the permeability of the dam p table 1 if the permeability is 0 the dam is impassable otherwise each time step after damming whether a fish moves to the other subnetwork or remains in the current one is decided by a bernoulli trial using p note that a permeability of 100 is thus not equivalent to the no dam case since dispersion of all fish through the dam would represent an unrealistic migratory scenario our model would provide consistent predictions only under settings in which the simulated dam presents low permeability and only a small fraction of fish disperse this is the case of large neotropical dams that usually are impassable or present low permeability even when transposing mechanisms e g fish ladders are present see makrakis et al 2012 pompeu et al 2012 for details no additional mortality is simulated in the dispersal process the dispersion through the dam happens randomly irrespective of the current spawning area the individuals that pass through the dam will initially reproduce in one of the two tributaries closest to the dam irrespective of whether their natal tributary is in the recipient subnetwork in subsequent reproductive seasons they can select other spawning areas according to the m probability 2 2 sensitivity analysis we conducted local sensitivity analyses to identify the parameters with the strongest influence on global fst values in each local analysis the selected parameter was varied over levels shown in table 2 while the rest of parameters were set to their standard values see section 2 3 for each parameter set we ran 25 simulation replicates over 2000 generations each without damming global fst values were calculated every 10 generations to analyze the effect of variations in selected parameters on fst values we fitted linear regression models using the mean global fst values over generations 1501 2000 fst values are already stabilized as the response variable and the tested parameter as predictor we fitted non linear regression models when the r2 of the linear model was lower than 0 70 we additionally fitted a multiple linear regression model to analyze the combined effect of tested parameters on global fst values using linearized data see equation in the table 2 statistical analyses were performed in r version 3 3 3 r core team 2017 we also analyzed the sensitivity of global fst values to the permeability of the dam in this analysis we added a dam downstream of the fourth tributary to a river network consisting of eight tributaries after 2000 generations and let the model run over 1000 generations with the presence of the dam the influence of dams with different permeability values i e value and direction asymmetrical and symmetrical on the fst values was evaluated on the 100th generation after the addition of the dam when the fst values stabilized 2 3 influence of dams on homing populations we assessed the impact of damming on the genetic structure of fish subpopulations under three permeability scenarios 1 non permeable 2 asymmetrical permeability and 3 symmetrical permeability we ran 25 simulation replicates of each scenario each one lasting 3000 generations we defined a river network with eight tributaries four at each margin of the main channel the corresponding fish subpopulations were named from a to h alternating the river margins subpopulations a c e and g spawn in the tributaries at the left margin b d f and h at the right margin fig 4 since water direction in the main river is not modeled a can be considered the most upstream subpopulation and h the most downstream or contrariwise parameters were set to their standard values m 1 0 d 10 g 500 μ 10 7 n 800 table 1 most parameter values were derived from the literature we used the value of mutation rate reported by brumfield et al 2003 for snp markers i e 10 7 10 9 since there is no specific data in the literature for fish species in neotropical river systems we used the number of individuals described for seven populations of the migratory species salmo salar from canada gomez uchida et al 2013 as our carrying capacity and the straying rate described for four populations of s salar from spain between 0 1 and 6 8 kuparinen et al 2010 we set a low mortality rate 10 per generation which means that one third of the population lives more than 10 years we based our choice on the available data for the pimelodidae neotropical fish family which frequently shows a long life span perez and fabré 2018 for example it has been reported that p corruscans individuals can have a life span over 10 years mateus and petrere júnior 2004 with some studies reporting relatively high survival rates even for individuals older than 10 years dos santos et al 2012 in each simulation the model is run over 2000 generations without barriers and in time step 2001 a dam is added downstream of the fourth tributary as a consequence the modeled river network is fragmented into 2 subnetworks with 4 tributaries each tributaries c and d being adjacent to the dam in one subnetwork tributaries e and f in the other the model is subsequently run over 1000 generations with the presence of the dam we analyzed three dam permeability scenarios non permeable asymmetrical permeability and symmetrical permeability sensitivity analyses showed that fst values were relatively insensitive to permeability p values see results section 3 1 so we chose a low level of permeability 5 in the simulations with asymmetrical permeability dispersion is only possible from subpopulations a b c and d source subnetwork to tributaries holding subpopulations e f g and h recipient subnetwork fig 4 this asymmetrical dispersion could represent either the movement of larvae and adults moving through spillways and fish ladders in the downstream direction or alternatively the upstream migration of adults moving through a fish ladder in the simulations with symmetrical permeability both ways all these modes of dispersion are possible global within subnetwork and paired fst were estimated for each generation and their values before generations 1501 2000 and after the addition of the dam both in the short term generations 2001 2010 and in the long term generations 2101 3000 were statistically contrasted by means of t tests genetic assignment analyses were carried out to assess the genetic structure and the genetic homogenization after the addition of the dam in the simulations the genetic structure of the metapopulation before damming at generation 2000 and after damming both short at generation 2001 and long term at generation 2100 was analyzed for each permeability scenario using the software structure 3 3 1 pritchard et al 2000 this software uses a markov chain monte carlo algorithm to infer population structure on the basis of multilocus genotype data to do this we ran three independent runs of 100 000 generations each after a burn in of 10 000 generations for each value of k number of possible populations characterized by a set of allele frequencies at each locus between 1 and 10 we chose the value of k for each permeability scenario before and after damming that maximized the segregation of the subpopulations i e that presented clusters in agreement with the spatially simulated subpopulations 3 results 3 1 sensitivity analysis the global fst value of the standard simulations i e with parameters set at their standard values before damming stabilized at around 200 generations mean fst 0 086 0 003 similarly global fst values stabilized at around 200 generations when the parameter values were varied except at the lowest value of straying rate 0 1 in which case the fst stabilized at around 500 generations the local sensitivity analyses showed that global fst values i decreased non linearly with increasing straying rate and maximum total population size carrying capacity ii increased linearly with increasing mortality rate linear model and iii were insensitive to the mutation rate table 1 fig a1 in supplementary material the multiple linear regression showed the combined influence of the parameters on fst values r2 0 995 straying and mortality rates had the greatest influence on fst values 0 996 0 004 and 0 994 0 006 respectively while the effect of the maximum total population size was also significant 0 928 0 013 p 0 05 mutation rate did not significantly influence fst values 0 360 1 342 p 0 79 the global fst value was influenced by both direction non permeable asymmetrical and symmetrical and level of permeability fig 3 the global fst increased when the dam was impermeable permeability 0 but decreased when the dam was permeable increasing the permeability of the dam decreased global fst values but the effect was stronger under symmetrical permeability under asymmetrical permeability the global fst value decreased with increasing permeability only up to values of 3 5 and then stabilized 3 2 impact of dams on genetic structure of homing populations regardless of the level non permeable 0 or 5 permeable and direction one or both ways of dam permeability the resulting global fst values decreased immediately after the addition of a barrier to the simulations fig 4 table a1 in supplementary material the mean global fst before the addition of the dam generations 1501 2000 was 0 085 0 003 this value was significantly higher paired t test p 0 05 than the global fst value after the addition of the dam at generations 2001 2010 non permeable fst 0 034 0 004 asymmetrical permeability fst 0 030 0 003 symmetrical permeability fst 0 026 0 003 within each subnetwork source and recipient the global fst values also decreased after the addition of the dam fig 4 table a1 the subpopulations located in the recipient subnetwork and adjacent to the dam i e e x f presented comparatively greater short term generations 2001 2010 reduction in their genetic differentiation before the dam fst 0 083 0 005 after the dam non permeable fst 0 016 0 004 asymmetrical permeability fst 0 007 0 002 and symmetrical permeability fst 0 010 0 002 fig 4 table a1 a similar decrease in genetic differentiation was observed between the four subpopulations adjacent to the dam i e c x d c x e c x f d x e d x f e x f the pairwise genetic differentiation between the remaining subpopulations resulted in reduced fst values following the addition of the dam except for the comparisons between subpopulations non adjacent to the dam i e a x b a x g a x h b x g b x h e g x h the assignment analyses confirmed the genetic homogenization among the subpopulations adjacent to the dam both subnetworks in the short term k 8 fig 5 the other subpopulations i e non adjacent remained differentiated genetically at any level and direction of permeability in the long term the global fst values stabilized after 100 generations at 0 054 in the asymmetrical permeability sd 0 001 and at 0 018 sd 0 000 when permeability was symmetrical fig 3 table a2 in supplementary material the simulations involving a non permeable dam resulted in increased values of genetic differentiation i e global fst even after 1000 generations mean fst 0 205 sd 0 008 in the simulations involving a non permeable dam in the long term the pairwise genetic differentiation between the isolated subpopulations i e source subnetwork x recipient subnetwork did not stabilize within 1000 generations after the addition of the dam the value still increasing and the fst values were greater than 0 25 at 1000 generations fig 4 table a2 the assignment analyses supported two groups each corresponding to one subnetwork fig 5 alternatively pairwise fst values within each group returned values that were slightly lower than the values registered before the introduction of the dam table a2 hence under this scenario the assignment analyses support that the genetic differentiation among all subpopulations was restored when the permeability of the dam was asymmetric the genetic differentiation fst between subpopulations at different subnetworks in the long term was lower i e source subnetwork x recipient subnetwork fig 4 table a2 in the same way the genetic differentiation between recipient subpopulations decreased alternatively the comparisons between source subpopulations presented increased genetic differentiation the assignment analyses supported 4 groups the source subpopulations presented genetic differentiation and the recipient subpopulations presented a mixture of the genetic profile of the source subpopulations fig 5 when the dam had symmetrical permeability in the long term any comparison returned lower fst values fig 4 table a2 in these simulations the assignment analyses did not reveal differences in the genetic profile of the different subpopulations fig 5 4 discussion 4 1 genetic structure of homing species the simulations performed without the presence of a dam produced the dendritic pattern of genetic structure that is expected for fish populations that display homing behavior bouza et al 1999 primmer et al 2006 östergren et al 2012 the dendritic pattern of genetic structure described for homing populations of fish results from the fidelity of individuals to their spawning area which creates discrete subpopulations and the genetic drift or local adaptation generate genetically differentiated subpopulations in each tributary hansen et al 2002 2007 jensen et al 2008 the role of each factor genetic drift and local adaptation influencing the differentiation of populations depends on the strength of the selection and the effective population size these factors combined with the dispersion rates create the genetic structure of the metapopulation garant et al 2007 yeaman and whitlock 2011 if the selection pressure is weak and the population is small genetic differentiation will be mainly influenced by genetic drift alternatively if selection is strong and the population is large the effect of the genetic drift will be negligible see freeland and petersen 2011 for details by simplification we did not model local adaptation in our simulations however the maximum total population size chosen for our simulations see section 2 2 sensitivity analysis for details and described for homing species i e salmo salar gomez uchida et al 2013 represents small populations and the genetic drift would be probably the main factor that affect the genetic differentiation among the simulated subpopulations even if local adaptation was modeled however the effects of natural selection on the genetic structure of subpopulations remains to be tested so this is an aspect of model structure that might be interesting to modify for future applications of our model 4 2 impact of dams on genetic structure of homing populations the simulations after damming support the hypothesis of baggio 2016 and baggio et al unpublished which predicts that metapopulations of homing species can be homogenized genetically both in the short term first 10 generations after the implementation of the dam and long term after 100 generations in the short term homogenizations were similar for any level of permeability to dispersion through the dam see fig 6 for summarized results since they are initially the result of the isolation of individuals from their spawning area the dam prevents these individuals from accessing their spawning areas mimicking extensive empirical data see results of gerlier and roche 1998 croze 2005 sato et al 2005 godinho and kynard 2006 2008 antonio et al 2007 makrakis et al 2012 the subpopulations of the tributaries adjacent to the barrier receive in our model individuals from local and upstream or downstream subpopulations isolated from their spawning area by the dam the simulations indicate that these subpopulations homogenize genetically which reduces the genetic differentiation of the metapopulation global fst this was already observed in the first generations after the introduction of the dam in the model and occurred also in any comparison between subpopulations that are adjacent to the dam i e all but a x b a x g a x h b x g b x h and g x h the reduction in the values of the paired fst values was greater when the comparisons involved two subpopulations adjacent to the dam i e c x d c x e c x f d x e d x f e x f in the long term the genetic structure of the metapopulation differs according to the modeled permeability fig 6 when an asymmetrically permeable dam was added recipient subpopulations were permanently homogenized as the result of the continuous arrival of individuals from the source subpopulations on the other hand the source subpopulations achieved a greater genetic differentiation after damming likely as a result of individuals straying to another subnetwork this appears to promote a reduction in the effective population size which increases the effect of genetic drift charlesworth 2009 dams with symmetrical permeability deeply altered the genetic structure of the subpopulations which became globally homogenized a similar scenario was reported by wollebæk et al 2011 who conducted a study based on six populations of salvelinus alpinus from two lakes in norway those subpopulations presented genetic differentiation in their spawning areas with the exception of the subpopulations directly adjacent i e upstream and downstream to the dam these subpopulations probably originally represented genetically distinct subpopulations and the fishways tunnels promoted their genetic homogenization as predicted in our study in this way our simulations predict that permeable dams symmetrical or asymmetrical generate a continuous genetic homogenization of subpopulations even under assumptions of low permeability lower levels of genetic differentiation are expected between subpopulations separated by permeable dams but are undesirable when the subpopulations were previously distinct e g thorstad et al 2008 wollebæk et al 2011 moreover asymmetrical dispersion generates continuous loss of individuals from upstream dispersion toward downstream or from downstream dispersion toward upstream subnetworks and can cause reduction in the size of their populations small population sizes make these populations susceptible to the extinction vortex due deterministic and stochastic factors gilpin and soulé 1986 jager 2001 jager et al 2007 2010 pelicice and agostinho 2012 in this way asymmetrical fishways may have a deeper impact owing to genetic and demographic factors by contrast the absence of permeability allowed the subpopulations to reestablish their genetic structure after the addition of the dam except between subpopulations isolated by the dam the original metapopulation was fragmented into two smaller metapopulations therefore in the long term a non permeable dam causes less genetic impact to homing populations than a permeable dam the lower genetic differentiation of subpopulations downstream of the impermeable dams in our results can be used to explain the genetic structure of the rainbow trout oncorhynchus mykiss from five coastal california basins described by clemento et al 2009 these authors genotyped 24 microsatellite loci of individuals from 3 to 5 sites upstream and downstream of impermeable dams in five basins totaling 20 localities the genetic analyses revealed less genetic differentiation between populations downstream of the dams inside each basin mean of fst 0 069 0 001 than between populations downstream of the dams from different basins mean fst 0 105 0 001 however these differences cannot be explained only by distances among basins since the mantel test did not support isolation by distance and the amova using all subpopulations downstream of the dams supported that only 3 2 of the genetic diversity was from between basin level in this way it is possible that the genetic differentiation among the populations downstream of the dams is being re established after their genetic homogenization due to the construction of the dams the impermeable dams were built between 1920 and 1965 about 17 to 50 generations of o mykiss back and our model suggests that the genetic differentiation among the subpopulations downstream of the dam would be recovered in less than 100 generations most empirical studies that test the effect of dams on the genetic structure of fish populations have sampled individuals from the main channel of each subnetwork thus they do not consider the possible presence of genetically distinct subpopulations in each subnetwork main channel and tributaries as expected for species that display homing behavior in this way few empirical studies present a scenario comparable with our simulations however our results suggest that empirical studies should be done to test the effect of dams on these species using individuals from different tributaries spawning areas although the representation and parameterization of some processes of our model are tailored to neotropical fish species the model structure is generic enough to assume that our results can be generalized to other systems characterized by species that display homing behavior thus our results represent a null model for studies on the impact of dams on homing populations of fish from different regions concluding our simulations support the genetic homogenization of species that display homing behavior in the first generation after population fragmentation by a dam especially in subpopulations adjacent to the dam in the long term non permeable dams allow the reestablishment of the dendritic genetic structure of homing populations with this in mind management plans should be developed to avoid the isolation of individuals from their spawning area during the construction of dams and to mitigate the impacts of barriers on the genetic structure of the metapopulations acknowledgments this study was funded by the ministério da pesca e

article 
25247,few studies have assessed the impact of dams on the distribution of the genetic diversity of neotropical fish species and some of them suggest that the genetic structure of fish metapopulations is not affected by damming however the effects of dams on the genetic structure of populations may hinge on the biological characteristics of the species such as homing behavior dams prevent some individuals from migrating from their feeding area to their natal spawning area constraining them to reproduce in the tributaries that are closest to the barrier and which are already being used as breeding grounds by other subpopulations in these places subpopulations may interbreed thus disrupting the overall genetic structure of the metapopulation to test this hypothesis we developed a demogenetic individual based model that simulates the impact of permeable and impermeable dams on the genetic structure of homing populations in both the long term and the short term our results support that genetic homogenization occurs among the subpopulations in the short term especially near the dam the impact of a dam on the genetic structure is also detectable in the long term 100 generations after the addition of the dam when the dam is permeable symmetrical or asymmetrical however when the barrier is not permeable the genetic differentiation among the subpopulations is reestablished in the long term our results suggest that conservation programs should be developed to avoid mitigate genetic homogenization of populations of fish that display homing behavior in the short term and to reestablish the pre dam genetic structure of these populations in the long term keywords conservation genetics dam individual based genetic model migratory fish neotropical fish

genetic diversity of populations of neotropical fish species e g barroca et al 2012 sanches et al 2012 ferreira et al 2016 pil et al 2018 most of them failed to detect genetic differentiation among populations in some of those studies the construction of the dam had happened recently ferreira et al 2016 the generation times of the fish species sampled were long sanches et al 2012 or the effective sizes of the original populations were large pil et al 2018 all these characteristics are known to delay or to impair genetic differentiation among populations wright 1931 slatkin 1995

östergren et al 2012 fig 1 a this dendritic genetic structure is directly derived from the dendritic network of rivers as subpopulations in different tributaries become genetically differentiated

studies have suggested that some freshwater species of neotropical fish present homing behavior godoy 1959 1975 batista and alves gomes 2006 godinho and kynard 2006 godinho et al 2007 2008 abreu et al 2009 pereira et al 2009 baggio 2016 duponchelle et al 2016 baggio et al unpublished thus understanding how dams affect homing fish populations is essential to the implementation of conservation programs in the neotropical region baggio 2016 and baggio et al unpublished suggested that the distribution of the genetic diversity of the pintado catfish pseudoplatystoma corruscans from the upper paraná river might reflect its homing behavior furthermore they suggested that the lack of genetic differentiation among the subpopulations of that species in the tributaries closest to the porto primavera dam may be associated with the barrier which might have promoted genetic homogenization by changing the migration pattern of the species pseudoplatystoma corruscans like other migratory neotropical fish species usually spawn in the fast waters of the tributaries the larvae and juveniles develop in flooded areas e g lagoons in the lower reaches of the tributaries and in the main channel the adults feed in those same habitats and also in reservoirs see carolsfeld et al 2003 for details when a dam is built individuals feeding in the main channel might get isolated downstream to the barrier which may prevent their migration back to their natal spawning area fig 1b as an alternative these individuals might reproduce in the closest tributaries downstream of the dam as reported for other neotropical sato et al 2005 godinho and kynard 2006 2008 antonio et al 2007 makrakis et al 2012 and temperate fish species thorstad et al 2008 this alternative behavior includes species that display homing behavior i e atlantic salmon salmo salar gerlier and roche 1998 croze 2005 hence in these tributaries individuals of distinct subpopulations those that could not reach their breeding tributaries might interbreed with individuals of the local subpopulation fig 1c the expected outcome is the genetic homogenization of the subpopulations at the tributaries that are close to the dam fig 1d interbreeding is thus expected to rapidly disrupt the genetic structure of local subpopulations echelle and connor 1989 olden et al 2004 gilman and behm 2011 at larger scales 500 to 3200 km prado et al 2017 found no genetic differentiation among populations of p corruscans and p reticulatum isolated by dams from paraná and paraguay rivers basins while pereira et al 2009 found six genetically structured populations of p corruscans separated by dams across the same basins however no study assessed the direct effect of damming on the distribution of the genetic diversity in populations upstream and downstream to the dam after the building of the barrier in order to test such hypothesis and its predictions we developed an individual based demogenetic model to simulate the evolution of the genetic structure of fish populations that present homing behavior under the presence of a dam a variety of individual based models ibms have been developed to simulate the population demogenetics of migratory fishes e g jager 2001 piou and prévost 2012 frank and baret 2013 including some that were specifically tailored to test the effect of the dendritic network of streams on the genetic structure of the studied species e g labonne et al 2008 thomaz et al 2016 landguth et al 2017 demogenetic ibms have been successfully applied to understand the genetic consequences of river fragmentation by dams on fish populations e g jager 2001 frank and baret 2013 landguth et al 2017 however as far as we know no model has tested the influence of dams on the dendritic genetic structure of fish homing subpopulations in addition the aforementioned models are typically complex models that cannot not be applied to data poor systems as those where neotropical species occur to overcome data limitations we used a simplified approach trying to balance complexity adequately by reducing the model to indispensable building blocks to understand the mechanisms under study we aimed to answer four questions with our model a can homing populations become genetically homogenized due the isolation of their spawning areas by dams b how many generations does it take for genetic homogenization to take place c what would be the impact of a dam on these populations in the long term dozen to hundred generations and in the short term 10 generations d what would be the impact of permeability the possibility of individuals dispersing through the dam on the genetic structure of these populations 2 material and methods 2 1 model description the model was written in fortran90 and their executable versions to windows linux and macintosh are available at https github com rbaggioufpr homing git model description follows the odd overview design concepts and details protocol proposed by grimm et al 2006 2010 for describing individual based models 2 1 1 purpose the model was developed to analyze the changes in the demogenetic structure that the presence of a migration barrier causes on a metapopulation of fish species that displays homing behavior while some processes are tailored to model features of neotropical fish species the modeling approach is generalizable and can be applied to other systems 2 1 2 entities state variables and scales the model represents a river network comprised by l tributaries each representing a spawning area see table 1 each tributary is characterized by its position in the river network and has a dynamic variable for the number of fish spawning in it the river network is described by its spatial configuration and carrying capacity maximum number of individuals of the metapopulation n which remain fixed over a simulation run the only dynamic state variable of the river network is the total number of fish in the system the model simulates the addition of a dam that fragments the river system into two subnetworks which are described by the same dynamic state variable and parameters as the river network entity fish are modeled at two hierarchical levels individuals and subpopulation each individual fish is characterized by its location spawning area and its genome see section 2 1 7 3 all individuals in the same spawning area form a subpopulation which is identified by an identity letter and characterized by its genetic diversity each time step generation represents one year which includes a feeding period and a reproductive period fish in neotropical rivers typically have one reproductive season per year the length of the simulation is defined by the user 2 1 3 process overview and scheduling during the first generations until ndam table 1 the model simulates the metapopulation dynamics without any migration barrier each time step fish individuals execute the following actions in the same predetermined order but fish are processed in a randomized sequence fig 2 1 fish choose a tributary to spawn in 2 fish survive or die and 3 alive fish reproduce at generation ndam damming takes place and the river network gets fragmented in two sections subnetworks by a either partially permeable or impermeable dam and fish individuals are assigned to either the upstream or downstream section of the river network this action is a punctual event that only takes place at the beginning of the time step ndam each time step after damming including time step ndam until the end of the simulation fish individuals determine first whether they disperse and move through the dam between sections if the dam is permeable or remain in the same section of the river network fish subsequently perform the three actions described for the no dam case spawning migration mortality and reproduction 2 1 4 design concepts adaptation objectives learning and prediction concepts do not apply to this model 2 1 4 1 basic principles the model is underpinned by landscape demogenetics which integrates demographic and genetics dynamics at the landscape spatial scale at the entire river network scale in this case homing behavior is the main driver of the demogenetics of the metapopulation in the case of homing species individuals go back to their natal tributary to spawn forming a subpopulation that is genetically distinct from other subpopulations as a consequence of genetic drift and natural selection density dependence operates on reproduction as spawning is precluded when the total size of the metapopulation reaches its carrying capacity 2 1 4 2 emergence the size and genetic diversity of each subpopulation and thus the demographic and genetic structure of the metapopulation emerges from the decision of the individuals on where to spawn and their capacity to disperse over the dam 2 1 4 3 sensing fish individuals know their current spawning area and sense mates and are assumed to perceive the presence of the dam and its permeability e g presence of a fish ladder 2 1 4 4 interaction individuals interact through sexual reproduction within the same tributary 2 1 4 5 stochasticity the spawning area and genome of each individual at initialization are randomly assigned whether a fish survives or dies displays a homing or straying behavior shows spawning fidelity to a non natal tributary or not and disperses over the dam or remains in the same section of the river network are all stochastic events based on probability distributions mating choice is stochastic and the loci transmitted by each parent to the offspring are randomly selected so the genotype of the offspring is a random combination of the parental genotypes dna mutation is also a stochastic event 2 1 4 6 collectives all fish that spawn in the same tributary form a distinct subpopulation subpopulation collectives emerge from the individual behaviors homing vs straying fidelity to a non natal spawning area active dispersion through dam vs residency but they do not actually affect the modeled fish in any way 2 1 4 7 observation the location spawning area and genome of each individual are recorded every generation the changes in the genetic structure are assessed through the global within subnetwork upstream or downstream to the dam and paired between two subpopulations fst index weir and cockerham 1984 weir 1996 before and after the addition of the dam global fst is the component of the genetic variation due to differences among all subpopulations within subnetwork fst is the component of the genetic variation due to differences among the subpopulations within each subnetwork the pairwise fst is the inter population level genetic variation between two subpopulations the fst is estimated as 1 f s t v 1 g σ p v 2 v 1 g σ p v 2 v 1 g σ g v 2 where σpv 2 is the variance between subpopulations and σ2 gv is the variance within subpopulations for the locus v the σ2 gv is estimated as the mean square for within populations msg 2 σ g v 2 m s g 1 i n i 1 i n i p a i 1 p a i where pai is the frequency of the allele a of the locus v in the i th subpopulation and ni is its subpopulation size the σ2 pv is estimated as 3 σ p v 2 1 n c m s p m s g where msp is the mean square for between populations and nc is composed by the average sample sizes and their variance then the nc is estimated as 4 n c 1 r 1 i 1 r n i i n i 2 i n i where r is the number of populations and ni is the population size of the population i the msp is estimated as 5 m s p 1 r 1 i n i p a i p a 2 where pa is the frequency of the allele a of the locus v in the metapopulation global fst subnetwork within subnetwork fst and among two populations pairwise fst the fst statistics were chosen because it is one of the most widespread indexes used to test genetic differentiation among populations fst varies from zero to one zero values represent absence of genetic differentiation and non zero values represent some level of genetic differentiation see freeland and petersen 2011 for details 2 1 5 initialization at initialization the user first defines the spatial configuration of the river network number and position of tributaries a model run is initialized with n fish individuals the river system is at carrying capacity which are randomly distributed across the l tributaries spawning areas the genome of each fish is composed of a sequence of g non linked loci with binary alleles each with the alleles 0 or 1 table 1 that are randomly assigned 2 1 6 input the model does not use any input data as the environment is assumed to be homogeneous in the entire river network and constant during the whole simulation 2 1 7 submodels 2 1 7 1 spawning migration each generation individuals choose their spawning area each fish reproduces in its natal tributary every year except if it strays to another spawning area each fish has a probability m straying rate table 1 of not adopting a homing behavior and thus spawning in a tributary different from its natal tributary this resulting from the individual s inability to find its natal spawning area an individual that does not adopt homing behavior becomes a strayer the strayer continues to reproduce in the new spawning area in subsequent generations unless it decides to migrate to another tributary to reproduce we assumed that the probability that a strayer shows no spawning fidelity to the new tributary and thus selects a new spawning area is the same as the straying rate m while it could be argued that homing behavior might be stronger than the fidelity to a new non natal tributary we made this assumption because there are no empirical studies that could provide us a guidance to model such complex spawning behavior so the value of the parameter would be highly uncertain therefore in the present study m actually represents the probability that a fish spawns in a tributary different from the one where it spawned in the last reproductive season hence the decision of a fish to spawn in a different tributary is modeled as a bernoulli trial stochastic true or false event using the probability of straying m a random number from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1 is drawn for each fish and if it is lower than m then the fish spawns in a different tributary in this case the fish has an equal probability to choose any tributary independently of its past either the natal or a previous non natal tributary and present spawning locations 2 1 7 2 mortality each generation each fish challenges its survival by means of a bernoulli trial using the mortality rate d table 1 the probability of dying is independent of the fish genome there is no selection of the loci spawning area and subpopulation size therefore fish do not have a fixed life span instead mortality is modeled as a random occurrence with a fixed probability 2 1 7 3 reproduction the reproduction is sexual and the individuals can mate randomly with the other individuals that are in the same spawning area tributary for simplicity the individuals are haploid and hermaphrodites individuals are processed first as females in a randomized order each choosing randomly a fish from its same tributary which will act as a male each mating produces one new individual each individual can reproduce only twice once as a female and once as a male during each reproductive season generation however due to density dependent processes see next paragraph some individuals might not reproduce or reproduce only once the genome of each mating individual is constituted of g non linked loci table 1 with binary alleles 0 1 at each locus the offspring inherits 50 of the dna of each parent the loci are randomized and the first 50 of them are inherited from one parent and the remaining 50 of them are inherited from the other parent during reproduction mutations can happen at rate μ per locus natural selection is not modeled and the genome is a neutral marker consequently all individuals have equivalent fitness in all spawning areas new born individuals are sexually mature in the next time step generation reproduction takes place only when the total population size sum of the number of individuals of all spawning areas is smaller than the carrying capacity of the river network n table 1 that is total population size cannot grow over the carrying capacity of the entire system therefore when the carrying capacity is reached reproduction stops we assumed that density dependence should operate on population growth at the entire river network scale because homing subpopulations in neotropical rivers should explore common areas for larval development feeding and growth and consequently they should be subject to the same predation pressures and resource availability in our model the entire river network is regarded as feeding grounds so density dependence should operate at this scale after the dam is added to the simulation the carrying capacity of each section of the river network is calculated proportionally to its size see section 2 1 7 4 and density dependence operates at the subnetwork spatial scale therefore tributaries do not have individual carrying capacities and since spawning migration and mortality are stochastic processes the number of spawners may differ across tributaries 2 1 7 4 damming after ndam 1 generations a dam is added to the river network downstream of tributary b table 1 which limits dispersal migration between the feeding and spawning areas and the gene flow among subpopulations the dam divides the river network in two sections subnetworks upstream from position 1 to b and downstream from position b 1 to l since individuals are randomly distributed throughout the feeding area during the feeding season each individual can be located either upstream or downstream of the dam when it is added when the barrier is implemented the probability that an individual gets located upstream of the dam bup is proportional to the total length of the upstream subnetwork so that b u p b l the probability of being located in the downstream subnetwork bdown is likewise proportional to its total length and so b d o w n 1 b u p we assume that all tributaries have the same length so the probability of being located either upstream or downstream to the dam depends on the number of tributaries in each subnetwork the individuals that remain in the subnetwork where their current spawning area is located reproduce in the same tributary in this generation unless they decide to migrate to another tributary to reproduce following the rules explained in the spawning migration submodel on the other hand individuals that become isolated from their current spawning area by the dam either upstream or downstream reproduce in this generation in one of the two tributaries one at each margin closest to the dam with equal probability of selection this rule was implemented to mimic reproductive patterns observed in neotropical migratory fish after damming sato et al 2005 godinho and kynard 2006 2008 antonio et al 2007 makrakis et al 2012 in large neotropical rivers as modeled in this study areas of high productivity can be distributed over a large section of the river network e g the floodplain in the upper paraná river carolsfeld et al 2003 large neotropical dams are usually built in the main channel of the basin and thus both spawning and highly productive feeding areas used by fish can be found both upstream and downstream to the dam accordingly under the scenario of the fragmented metapopulation under a homogeneous environment i e uniform random distribution in the feeding area upstream and downstream to the dam the carrying capacity of each subnetwork nup and ndown is proportional to its length and the carrying capacity of the entire network n u p n b l and n d o w n n n u p the construction of the dam and subsequent redistribution of fish in the upstream and downstream subnetworks is a punctual event that takes place at the beginning of the generation ndam once the action is over the processes of dispersal though the dam see next submodel spawning migration mortality and reproduction corresponding to this generation ndam are performed 2 1 7 5 dispersal through the dam after damming individuals have the possibility to disperse through the dam one way i e asymmetrical upstream fish moving through fish ladder or asymmetrical downstream larvae and adults moving through spillways and fish ladders or both ways symmetrical permeability and reproduce in the other section of the river network the dispersal process includes both unintentional straying by homing individuals and strayers e g larvae and fish dragged by the current fish that migrate downstream and do not find the fish ladders to migrate upstream fish that migrate upstream get lost in the reservoir and do not find the fish ladders to migrate downstream and intentional straying by strayers dispersion of the fishes thus both strayers and homing individuals can disperse trough the dam since there are no empirical studies providing data to differentiate between intentional and unintentional dispersal in neotropical systems both types are modeled through a single parameter the probability of dispersion depends on the permeability of the dam p table 1 if the permeability is 0 the dam is impassable otherwise each time step after damming whether a fish moves to the other subnetwork or remains in the current one is decided by a bernoulli trial using p note that a permeability of 100 is thus not equivalent to the no dam case since dispersion of all fish through the dam would represent an unrealistic migratory scenario our model would provide consistent predictions only under settings in which the simulated dam presents low permeability and only a small fraction of fish disperse this is the case of large neotropical dams that usually are impassable or present low permeability even when transposing mechanisms e g fish ladders are present see makrakis et al 2012 pompeu et al 2012 for details no additional mortality is simulated in the dispersal process the dispersion through the dam happens randomly irrespective of the current spawning area the individuals that pass through the dam will initially reproduce in one of the two tributaries closest to the dam irrespective of whether their natal tributary is in the recipient subnetwork in subsequent reproductive seasons they can select other spawning areas according to the m probability 2 2 sensitivity analysis we conducted local sensitivity analyses to identify the parameters with the strongest influence on global fst values in each local analysis the selected parameter was varied over levels shown in table 2 while the rest of parameters were set to their standard values see section 2 3 for each parameter set we ran 25 simulation replicates over 2000 generations each without damming global fst values were calculated every 10 generations to analyze the effect of variations in selected parameters on fst values we fitted linear regression models using the mean global fst values over generations 1501 2000 fst values are already stabilized as the response variable and the tested parameter as predictor we fitted non linear regression models when the r2 of the linear model was lower than 0 70 we additionally fitted a multiple linear regression model to analyze the combined effect of tested parameters on global fst values using linearized data see equation in the table 2 statistical analyses were performed in r version 3 3 3 r core team 2017 we also analyzed the sensitivity of global fst values to the permeability of the dam in this analysis we added a dam downstream of the fourth tributary to a river network consisting of eight tributaries after 2000 generations and let the model run over 1000 generations with the presence of the dam the influence of dams with different permeability values i e value and direction asymmetrical and symmetrical on the fst values was evaluated on the 100th generation after the addition of the dam when the fst values stabilized 2 3 influence of dams on homing populations we assessed the impact of damming on the genetic structure of fish subpopulations under three permeability scenarios 1 non permeable 2 asymmetrical permeability and 3 symmetrical permeability we ran 25 simulation replicates of each scenario each one lasting 3000 generations we defined a river network with eight tributaries four at each margin of the main channel the corresponding fish subpopulations were named from a to h alternating the river margins subpopulations a c e and g spawn in the tributaries at the left margin b d f and h at the right margin fig 4 since water direction in the main river is not modeled a can be considered the most upstream subpopulation and h the most downstream or contrariwise parameters were set to their standard values m 1 0 d 10 g 500 μ 10 7 n 800 table 1 most parameter values were derived from the literature we used the value of mutation rate reported by brumfield et al 2003 for snp markers i e 10 7 10 9 since there is no specific data in the literature for fish species in neotropical river systems we used the number of individuals described for seven populations of the migratory species salmo salar from canada gomez uchida et al 2013 as our carrying capacity and the straying rate described for four populations of s salar from spain between 0 1 and 6 8 kuparinen et al 2010 we set a low mortality rate 10 per generation which means that one third of the population lives more than 10 years we based our choice on the available data for the pimelodidae neotropical fish family which frequently shows a long life span perez and fabré 2018 for example it has been reported that p corruscans individuals can have a life span over 10 years mateus and petrere júnior 2004 with some studies reporting relatively high survival rates even for individuals older than 10 years dos santos et al 2012 in each simulation the model is run over 2000 generations without barriers and in time step 2001 a dam is added downstream of the fourth tributary as a consequence the modeled river network is fragmented into 2 subnetworks with 4 tributaries each tributaries c and d being adjacent to the dam in one subnetwork tributaries e and f in the other the model is subsequently run over 1000 generations with the presence of the dam we analyzed three dam permeability scenarios non permeable asymmetrical permeability and symmetrical permeability sensitivity analyses showed that fst values were relatively insensitive to permeability p values see results section 3 1 so we chose a low level of permeability 5 in the simulations with asymmetrical permeability dispersion is only possible from subpopulations a b c and d source subnetwork to tributaries holding subpopulations e f g and h recipient subnetwork fig 4 this asymmetrical dispersion could represent either the movement of larvae and adults moving through spillways and fish ladders in the downstream direction or alternatively the upstream migration of adults moving through a fish ladder in the simulations with symmetrical permeability both ways all these modes of dispersion are possible global within subnetwork and paired fst were estimated for each generation and their values before generations 1501 2000 and after the addition of the dam both in the short term generations 2001 2010 and in the long term generations 2101 3000 were statistically contrasted by means of t tests genetic assignment analyses were carried out to assess the genetic structure and the genetic homogenization after the addition of the dam in the simulations the genetic structure of the metapopulation before damming at generation 2000 and after damming both short at generation 2001 and long term at generation 2100 was analyzed for each permeability scenario using the software structure 3 3 1 pritchard et al 2000 this software uses a markov chain monte carlo algorithm to infer population structure on the basis of multilocus genotype data to do this we ran three independent runs of 100 000 generations each after a burn in of 10 000 generations for each value of k number of possible populations characterized by a set of allele frequencies at each locus between 1 and 10 we chose the value of k for each permeability scenario before and after damming that maximized the segregation of the subpopulations i e that presented clusters in agreement with the spatially simulated subpopulations 3 results 3 1 sensitivity analysis the global fst value of the standard simulations i e with parameters set at their standard values before damming stabilized at around 200 generations mean fst 0 086 0 003 similarly global fst values stabilized at around 200 generations when the parameter values were varied except at the lowest value of straying rate 0 1 in which case the fst stabilized at around 500 generations the local sensitivity analyses showed that global fst values i decreased non linearly with increasing straying rate and maximum total population size carrying capacity ii increased linearly with increasing mortality rate linear model and iii were insensitive to the mutation rate table 1 fig a1 in supplementary material the multiple linear regression showed the combined influence of the parameters on fst values r2 0 995 straying and mortality rates had the greatest influence on fst values 0 996 0 004 and 0 994 0 006 respectively while the effect of the maximum total population size was also significant 0 928 0 013 p 0 05 mutation rate did not significantly influence fst values 0 360 1 342 p 0 79 the global fst value was influenced by both direction non permeable asymmetrical and symmetrical and level of permeability fig 3 the global fst increased when the dam was impermeable permeability 0 but decreased when the dam was permeable increasing the permeability of the dam decreased global fst values but the effect was stronger under symmetrical permeability under asymmetrical permeability the global fst value decreased with increasing permeability only up to values of 3 5 and then stabilized 3 2 impact of dams on genetic structure of homing populations regardless of the level non permeable 0 or 5 permeable and direction one or both ways of dam permeability the resulting global fst values decreased immediately after the addition of a barrier to the simulations fig 4 table a1 in supplementary material the mean global fst before the addition of the dam generations 1501 2000 was 0 085 0 003 this value was significantly higher paired t test p 0 05 than the global fst value after the addition of the dam at generations 2001 2010 non permeable fst 0 034 0 004 asymmetrical permeability fst 0 030 0 003 symmetrical permeability fst 0 026 0 003 within each subnetwork source and recipient the global fst values also decreased after the addition of the dam fig 4 table a1 the subpopulations located in the recipient subnetwork and adjacent to the dam i e e x f presented comparatively greater short term generations 2001 2010 reduction in their genetic differentiation before the dam fst 0 083 0 005 after the dam non permeable fst 0 016 0 004 asymmetrical permeability fst 0 007 0 002 and symmetrical permeability fst 0 010 0 002 fig 4 table a1 a similar decrease in genetic differentiation was observed between the four subpopulations adjacent to the dam i e c x d c x e c x f d x e d x f e x f the pairwise genetic differentiation between the remaining subpopulations resulted in reduced fst values following the addition of the dam except for the comparisons between subpopulations non adjacent to the dam i e a x b a x g a x h b x g b x h e g x h the assignment analyses confirmed the genetic homogenization among the subpopulations adjacent to the dam both subnetworks in the short term k 8 fig 5 the other subpopulations i e non adjacent remained differentiated genetically at any level and direction of permeability in the long term the global fst values stabilized after 100 generations at 0 054 in the asymmetrical permeability sd 0 001 and at 0 018 sd 0 000 when permeability was symmetrical fig 3 table a2 in supplementary material the simulations involving a non permeable dam resulted in increased values of genetic differentiation i e global fst even after 1000 generations mean fst 0 205 sd 0 008 in the simulations involving a non permeable dam in the long term the pairwise genetic differentiation between the isolated subpopulations i e source subnetwork x recipient subnetwork did not stabilize within 1000 generations after the addition of the dam the value still increasing and the fst values were greater than 0 25 at 1000 generations fig 4 table a2 the assignment analyses supported two groups each corresponding to one subnetwork fig 5 alternatively pairwise fst values within each group returned values that were slightly lower than the values registered before the introduction of the dam table a2 hence under this scenario the assignment analyses support that the genetic differentiation among all subpopulations was restored when the permeability of the dam was asymmetric the genetic differentiation fst between subpopulations at different subnetworks in the long term was lower i e source subnetwork x recipient subnetwork fig 4 table a2 in the same way the genetic differentiation between recipient subpopulations decreased alternatively the comparisons between source subpopulations presented increased genetic differentiation the assignment analyses supported 4 groups the source subpopulations presented genetic differentiation and the recipient subpopulations presented a mixture of the genetic profile of the source subpopulations fig 5 when the dam had symmetrical permeability in the long term any comparison returned lower fst values fig 4 table a2 in these simulations the assignment analyses did not reveal differences in the genetic profile of the different subpopulations fig 5 4 discussion 4 1 genetic structure of homing species the simulations performed without the presence of a dam produced the dendritic pattern of genetic structure that is expected for fish populations that display homing behavior bouza et al 1999 primmer et al 2006 östergren et al 2012 the dendritic pattern of genetic structure described for homing populations of fish results from the fidelity of individuals to their spawning area which creates discrete subpopulations and the genetic drift or local adaptation generate genetically differentiated subpopulations in each tributary hansen et al 2002 2007 jensen et al 2008 the role of each factor genetic drift and local adaptation influencing the differentiation of populations depends on the strength of the selection and the effective population size these factors combined with the dispersion rates create the genetic structure of the metapopulation garant et al 2007 yeaman and whitlock 2011 if the selection pressure is weak and the population is small genetic differentiation will be mainly influenced by genetic drift alternatively if selection is strong and the population is large the effect of the genetic drift will be negligible see freeland and petersen 2011 for details by simplification we did not model local adaptation in our simulations however the maximum total population size chosen for our simulations see section 2 2 sensitivity analysis for details and described for homing species i e salmo salar gomez uchida et al 2013 represents small populations and the genetic drift would be probably the main factor that affect the genetic differentiation among the simulated subpopulations even if local adaptation was modeled however the effects of natural selection on the genetic structure of subpopulations remains to be tested so this is an aspect of model structure that might be interesting to modify for future applications of our model 4 2 impact of dams on genetic structure of homing populations the simulations after damming support the hypothesis of baggio 2016 and baggio et al unpublished which predicts that metapopulations of homing species can be homogenized genetically both in the short term first 10 generations after the implementation of the dam and long term after 100 generations in the short term homogenizations were similar for any level of permeability to dispersion through the dam see fig 6 for summarized results since they are initially the result of the isolation of individuals from their spawning area the dam prevents these individuals from accessing their spawning areas mimicking extensive empirical data see results of gerlier and roche 1998 croze 2005 sato et al 2005 godinho and kynard 2006 2008 antonio et al 2007 makrakis et al 2012 the subpopulations of the tributaries adjacent to the barrier receive in our model individuals from local and upstream or downstream subpopulations isolated from their spawning area by the dam the simulations indicate that these subpopulations homogenize genetically which reduces the genetic differentiation of the metapopulation global fst this was already observed in the first generations after the introduction of the dam in the model and occurred also in any comparison between subpopulations that are adjacent to the dam i e all but a x b a x g a x h b x g b x h and g x h the reduction in the values of the paired fst values was greater when the comparisons involved two subpopulations adjacent to the dam i e c x d c x e c x f d x e d x f e x f in the long term the genetic structure of the metapopulation differs according to the modeled permeability fig 6 when an asymmetrically permeable dam was added recipient subpopulations were permanently homogenized as the result of the continuous arrival of individuals from the source subpopulations on the other hand the source subpopulations achieved a greater genetic differentiation after damming likely as a result of individuals straying to another subnetwork this appears to promote a reduction in the effective population size which increases the effect of genetic drift charlesworth 2009 dams with symmetrical permeability deeply altered the genetic structure of the subpopulations which became globally homogenized a similar scenario was reported by wollebæk et al 2011 who conducted a study based on six populations of salvelinus alpinus from two lakes in norway those subpopulations presented genetic differentiation in their spawning areas with the exception of the subpopulations directly adjacent i e upstream and downstream to the dam these subpopulations probably originally represented genetically distinct subpopulations and the fishways tunnels promoted their genetic homogenization as predicted in our study in this way our simulations predict that permeable dams symmetrical or asymmetrical generate a continuous genetic homogenization of subpopulations even under assumptions of low permeability lower levels of genetic differentiation are expected between subpopulations separated by permeable dams but are undesirable when the subpopulations were previously distinct e g thorstad et al 2008 wollebæk et al 2011 moreover asymmetrical dispersion generates continuous loss of individuals from upstream dispersion toward downstream or from downstream dispersion toward upstream subnetworks and can cause reduction in the size of their populations small population sizes make these populations susceptible to the extinction vortex due deterministic and stochastic factors gilpin and soulé 1986 jager 2001 jager et al 2007 2010 pelicice and agostinho 2012 in this way asymmetrical fishways may have a deeper impact owing to genetic and demographic factors by contrast the absence of permeability allowed the subpopulations to reestablish their genetic structure after the addition of the dam except between subpopulations isolated by the dam the original metapopulation was fragmented into two smaller metapopulations therefore in the long term a non permeable dam causes less genetic impact to homing populations than a permeable dam the lower genetic differentiation of subpopulations downstream of the impermeable dams in our results can be used to explain the genetic structure of the rainbow trout oncorhynchus mykiss from five coastal california basins described by clemento et al 2009 these authors genotyped 24 microsatellite loci of individuals from 3 to 5 sites upstream and downstream of impermeable dams in five basins totaling 20 localities the genetic analyses revealed less genetic differentiation between populations downstream of the dams inside each basin mean of fst 0 069 0 001 than between populations downstream of the dams from different basins mean fst 0 105 0 001 however these differences cannot be explained only by distances among basins since the mantel test did not support isolation by distance and the amova using all subpopulations downstream of the dams supported that only 3 2 of the genetic diversity was from between basin level in this way it is possible that the genetic differentiation among the populations downstream of the dams is being re established after their genetic homogenization due to the construction of the dams the impermeable dams were built between 1920 and 1965 about 17 to 50 generations of o mykiss back and our model suggests that the genetic differentiation among the subpopulations downstream of the dam would be recovered in less than 100 generations most empirical studies that test the effect of dams on the genetic structure of fish populations have sampled individuals from the main channel of each subnetwork thus they do not consider the possible presence of genetically distinct subpopulations in each subnetwork main channel and tributaries as expected for species that display homing behavior in this way few empirical studies present a scenario comparable with our simulations however our results suggest that empirical studies should be done to test the effect of dams on these species using individuals from different tributaries spawning areas although the representation and parameterization of some processes of our model are tailored to neotropical fish species the model structure is generic enough to assume that our results can be generalized to other systems characterized by species that display homing behavior thus our results represent a null model for studies on the impact of dams on homing populations of fish from different regions concluding our simulations support the genetic homogenization of species that display homing behavior in the first generation after population fragmentation by a dam especially in subpopulations adjacent to the dam in the long term non permeable dams allow the reestablishment of the dendritic genetic structure of homing populations with this in mind management plans should be developed to avoid the isolation of individuals from their spawning area during the construction of dams and to mitigate the impacts of barriers on the genetic structure of the metapopulations acknowledgments this study was funded by the ministério da pesca e

25248,finding efficient and environmentally sustainable methods for arable weed management is a current challenge in agroecosystems weed species disperse over scales larger than the field landscape scale management could therefore reinforce field scale strategies for innovative cropping systems in particular the introduction of semi natural habitats such as permanent meadows which are unsuitable habitats for annual arable weeds could potentially reduce weed densities in crops we developed a spatially explicit landscape scale model of annual arable weed population dynamics including the main components of weed management at cropping system level crop rotation tillage regime intensity of herbicide use and mechanical weeding the variability of responses to these factors for different weed species functional types was considered by modelling four functional response groups we used this model to investigate the effects of increasing the proportion of permanent meadows in the landscape and of the spatial arrangement of meadows on weed density in crops with this model increasing the proportion of permanent meadows significantly decreased mean seed density of weeds in crops furthermore weed density in crops was found to be lower for landscapes in which the meadows were scattered rather than clustered together in large zones however these spatial and landscape scale effects were much weaker than the local effect of cropping systems weed density in permanent meadows was more sensitive to the proportion of meadows and to their spatial arrangement than weed density in crops although the absolute value of weed density remained low in this unfavourable habitat keywords virtual landscape population dynamics crops rotation tillage herbicides 1 introduction in agroecosystems the management of weed populations in crops is challenging due to the need to limit weed impact on production whilst conserving weed contribution to biodiversity marshall et al 2003 mézière et al 2015 the limitation of crop yield by weeds is often related to local infestations which may occur in a given year due to weed management failure the control of weed abundance in cropped fields is mostly achieved through field scale management which can be highly reliant on herbicide use or more integrated i e mobilizing cropping practices that have an impact on weed population dynamics e g crop rotation sowing time management and mechanical weeding chikowo et al 2009 however annual arable weeds disperse beyond the edge of the field benvenuti 2007 alignier and petit 2012 and therefore it is questionable whether weed management should not be thought at multiple scales from the field to the wider landscape petit et al 2011 2013 there is strong empirical evidence that the characteristics of the landscape surrounding a cropped fields affects its in field weed richness and composition gaba et al 2010 alignier et al 2013 henckel et al 2015 but the effect of landscape scale drivers on weed abundance is much less documented studies that have simultaneously explored the contribution of field management and landscape context on weed abundance suggest that the impact of landscape scale factors is marginal compared to the effect of local field management ekroos et al 2010 hawes et al 2010 petit et al 2016 recent national scale british analyses provide correlative evidence that weed abundance is positively affected by field size alignier et al 2017 the diversity of landscape elements surrounding arable field bohan and haughton 2012 and the proportion cover of cropped area in the wider landscape surrounding the field alignier et al 2017 the existence of such correlative patterns raises the question of the contribution of weed dispersal processes to the local dynamics of weed populations in arable fields annual arable weed species are characterised by high levels of seed production and long term seed viability baker 1974 and this temporal dispersal explains that modelling approaches are often adopted to assess the long term effect of field management on weed abundances sester et al 2007 colbach et al 2014 in such models the level of herbicide use the nature of soil tillage operations and the crop rotation are among the key field management factors that drive weed dynamics gardarin et al 2007 2012 weeds response to these management factors depends on some of their biological characteristics mainly germination period seed size buhler 1995 gunton et al 2011 addressing the potential contribution of weed dispersal to local annual arable weed abundance would require to expand existing modelling frameworks in space in order to account for weed spatial dispersal but also to explicitly consider the temporal dynamics of the landscape dynamic landscapes few studies have adopted spatially explicit modelling approaches to assess the dynamics of annual arable weeds at the landscape scale existing studies considered only one species and a small number of agricultural practices perry and gonzalez andujar 1993 gonzalez andujar and perry 1995 dauer et al 2009 gonzález diáz et al 2012 2015 or focused exclusively on the effects of neighbouring fields gonzalez et al 2001 and none of these models specifically represented cropping systems in these models crop type directly determined the set of population dynamics parameters with at best the possibility of varying herbicide use intensity whereas tillage regime which is known to impact the local weed dynamics was never taken into account there is thus a need for a modelling framework that simultaneously considers dispersal processes over a large landscape wide scale and realistic cropping system with a balance between simplicity and realism to prevent the final model becoming too complex and intractable holst et al 2007 in this paper we propose a modelling framework to address the question of the relative contribution of weed dispersal to annual arable weed abundances in contrasted scenarios of landscape composition and configuration weed abundance is modelled for four types of annual arable weed species or virtual species that differ for their germination period and seed size two characteristics that are related both to intrinsic demographic parameters bond 2008 odera systèmes 2014 and to weed response to cropping systems buhler 1995 gunton et al 2011 cropped areas in the landscape are three types of realistic cropping systems no tillage systems with high level of herbicides systems including tillage and non chemical weeding and classical systems including both tillage and herbicide applications we consider a fourth habitat type permanent meadows considered to be much less suitable than arable crops for the annual arable weeds modelled here moonen and marshall 2001 meiss et al 2010 cordeau et al 2012 the framework is then used to explore contrasting scenarios to test the following hypotheses i increasing the proportion of unsuitable habitat in the landscape significantly decreases weed infestation in crops ii this effect is magnified if the unsuitable habitat is scattered fragmented throughout the landscape rather than clustered together 2 materials and methods 2 1 agronomical practices we focused on three main management options that drive weed population dynamics sowing time soil tillage regime and herbicide use intensity and modelled functional species types that respond differently to these three determinants sowing time is a determinant factor in the selection of the weed species able to grow in a given crop resulting in contrasting weed floras in winter and spring crops milberg et al 2001 a trait based analysis revealed that crop sowing period was a better predictor of the composition of weed communities than crop type gunton et al 2011 similarly the dichotomy between winter and spring crops has been identified as the most explanatory and predictive variable in species distribution models outcompeting the full crop list and other more detailed classifications of crop types alignier et al 2013 the type of mechanical operations applied to the soil has a major impact on the weed seed bank in particular inversion tillage is designed to aerate the soil and to improve its structure it involves turning over the uppermost 20 40 cm of the soil with a plough and has major consequences for the distribution of seeds in the soil yenish et al 2016 cardina et al 2002 sester et al 2006 and for germination rate gardarin et al 2010 showed that the maximal shoot and root lengths of weeds which determine the maximum depth from which a seed can germinate are positively related to seed weight species with low or high seed weights would therefore be expected to respond differently to inversion tillage large seed would be expected to have better germination rates at greater depths gardarin et al 2011 cordeau et al 2015 whereas small seeds preferentially germinate close to the soil surface this hypothesis was confirmed by the observation that tillage reduction is followed by a decline in weed species with large seeds buhler 1995 in addition seed production the quantity of seed produced by a given plant and seed mortality are also related to seed weight bond 2008 odera systèmes 2014 finally we considered that the herbicide use intensity often characterized through the treatment frequency index an indicator which quantifies the number of recommended doses applied to each hectare oecd 2001 directly modulates the plant mortality rate 2 2 species functional types we considered four functional types of weed species defined according to their preferential germination in winter or spring crops and seed size wintersmall winterlarge springsmall and springlarge doing this we distinguished i between winter weed species those growing preferentially in winter crops and spring weed species that differ in terms of germination rate proportion of germinating seeds and ii between small seed species 5 mg and large seed species 5 mg that differ in terms of germination rate seed mortality odera systèmes 2014 and seed production bond 2008 examples of species of each functional types are wintersmall alopecurus myosuroides capsella bursa pastoris and viola arvensis winterlarge veronica hederifolia fallopia convolvulus and galium aparine springsmall chenopodium album persicaria maculosa and solanum nigrum springlarge convolvulus arvensis and ambrosia trifida 2 3 agricultural systems and response of the species functional types in real agricultural landscapes the above described agronomical practices sowing time soil tillage regime and herbicide use intensity are not determined separately but are rather part of an agricultural system we here combined these three drivers of weed dynamics to define three contrasted and realistic cropping systems observed in agricultural landscapes of europe and north america crops with tillage and herbicide use herbi till crops without herbicide use noherbi till and crops without tillage and with herbicide use herbi notill the following paragraph describes their detailed characteristics based on real combination of practices in french commercial farms the herbitill system was considered to have a crop succession with mainly winter crops 3 years out of four and few spring crops with a frequent use of tillage half of winter crops and one fourth of spring crops in herbitill system are tilled each year in this system herbicide use combined with possible mechanical weeding operations were considered to remove 75 of the weed species with a phenology similar to that of the crop i e wintersmall and winterlarge in winter crops and springsmall and springlarge in spring crops conversely the noherbi till system was considered to have half of spring crops in their crop succession spring crops being systematically tilled and winter crops never tilled weed management of this system based solely on mechanical weeding was considered less efficient mortality 60 in both noherbi till and herbitill systems weed plants with a phenology different from that of the crop were considered to be largely destroyed by sowing for winter weeds in spring crops or harvesting for spring weeds in winter crops operations before seed production mortality 90 herbi notill were considered to have an intermediate use of spring crops one year out of three and to never use tillage in this system the absence of mechanical operations in herbi notill fields was considered to be compensated by greater herbicide use killing 95 of all weed plants table 1 finally unlike the three crop land uses permanent meadows pm were assumed to be long term stable and unsuitable habitats for annual arable weeds because the well established dense grass cover and successive mowing should limit the growth rate of weed populations by decreasing plant growth e g teasdale and frank 1983 and seed production e g mertens and jansen 2002 and through interception of the seed rain e g doisy et al 2014 2 4 landscape definition and dynamics in the modelling framework developed a landscape is defined as a mosaic of polygonal field plots each assigned a land use type either herbi till noherbi till herbi notill or pm the first three land uses are considered to be crop land uses each year every field which is assigned one of the three types of crop land uses is defined as either spring crop or winter crops and either tilled or not according to the definition of the land uses table 1 thus for a given landscape the map of land uses is constant over time whereas the maps of spring versus winter crops and of tilled field are changing each year between field zones were considered to be homogeneous and are referred to as the landscape matrix 2 5 population dynamics model the population dynamics model is based on a raster representation of the landscape with a resolution of 3 m using a one year time step the local dynamics population growth for each pixel of the raster is dependent on ecological parameters that are in turn dependent on land use in the pixel and the type of weed species newly produced seeds disperse further over the landscape according to a dispersal kernel local weed population dynamics depends on five parameters seed mortality rate sm germination rate gr plant mortality rate pm seed production sp number of seeds produced per plant and carrying capacity k maximal adult plant density each year a proportion 1 sm of viable seeds either germinates with a proportion gr to produce plants or remains in the seed bank with proportion 1 gr as a result of natural mortality and weed management practices a proportion pm of plants dies and the surviving plants proportion 1 pm each produce sp new seeds that disperse according to a bivariate student s distribution 2dt clark et al 1999 to enter the seed bank fig 1 plant density is limited by carrying capacity k therefore over a raster corresponding to a domain a x y the local densities number per m² of seeds st and plants pt at year t at the pixel location x y are driven by the following equations 1 p t x y min k t x y 1 s m t x y g r t x y 1 p m t x y s t 1 x y 2 s t x y 1 s m t x y 1 g r t x y s t 1 x y x y a p t x y s p t x y f 2 d t x x y y 3 f 2 d t x y b 1 π a ² 1 x 2 y ² a ² b eq 1 corresponds to number of plants that emerge from the seed bank left after weeding and limited by the carrying capacity the first part of eq 2 describes the number of seeds that remains alive in the seedbank while its second parts corresponds to the dispersal in the 2dt distribution eq 3 a is a scale parameter and b is a parameter that determines the weight of the distribution tail to ensure that the density limitation of weed plants also depend on the effects mentioned above the carrying capacity k was defined as a function of the species functional type s the land use l the crop type c and

demographic parameters are completely determined by i land use herbi till noherbi till herbi notill or pm ii crop type winter or spring and iii the presence or absence of tillage a reference value for each of the demographic parameters sm gr pm and sp for each of the four species functional types was obtained through a literature survey infloweb 2014 odera systèmes 2014 gonzález diáz et al 2012 gardarin et al 2011 2010 2012 bond 2008 fumanal et al 2007 sester et al 2006 grundy et al 2003 freckleton and watkinson 1998 perry and gonzalez andujar 1993 roberts and feast 1972 see table a1 in appendix a and adapted according to land use crop type and the presence or absence of tillage to represent the effects described above table 1 because the local dynamics is determined by field properties at a given time step all the pixels of a given field have the same land use type crop type and tillage value and therefore the same values of demographic parameters conversely the plant and seed densities could vary over the pixels of a given field as a result of the dispersal process dispersal was parameterized using established relationships between plant traits maximal plant height and seed mass and dispersal distances thomson et al 2010 2011 to 15 current weed species either anemochorous or zoochorous over this set of species the calculated average mean and maximal distances were respectively 1 3 m and 71 1 m table a2 in appendix a to fit with this order of magnitude the 2dt dispersal function eq 3 was parametrized with a 0 01 and b 0 72 which corresponded to a mean dispersal of 1 5 m and 99 of dispersal events occurring over distances of less than 66 m 2 7 initialization for each of the four land uses we first ran the local demographic model without dispersal over 150 years with 10 replicates per land uses with an initial seed density of 2 seeds m 2 of each species functional type convergence was reached after less than 100 years as a result of the definition of local parameters mean densities of plants and seeds converged to a non zero value except for winterlarge and springlarge species functional types in meadows which is consistent with experimental studies showing that weed species with large seeds are not favoured in habitat without tillage and or with permanent cover cordeau et al 2015 for all subsequent simulations the initial seed density of each land use was chosen as the mean seed density over the last 50 years of this initialization run the spatial distribution of initial seed density is thus determined by the spatial distribution of land uses 2 8 landscape generation and simulation plan 2 8 1 field structures we used a set of five maps with contrasting spatial patterns of field plots hereafter referred to as field structures to account for sources of variability associated with field size distribution the spatial distribution of fields within the landscape and the geometric properties of fields these structures covered the gradients of mean field area and total number of fields fig 2 each field structure corresponded to a 4 4 km sample from the land parcel identification system official european geographic database for payments to farmers in the framework of the common agricultural policy for the côte d or area france with these field structures three sets of land use maps were produced 2 8 2 land use maps the first set of maps consisted of homogeneous maps in which all the fields are assigned the same land use 20 maps corresponding to each of the four land uses over the five field structures this corresponded to a reference situations with either 0 or 100 of permanent meadows the second set of maps was dedicated to studying the effect of the proportion of permanent meadows we used a simulated annealing algorithm saa to generate spatial configurations with either 3 10 25 or 50 area of permanent meadows 10 replicates each see fig 3 for some map examples the lowest proportion corresponds to the minimum area under meadow for a farm to receive conditional subsidiaries through the ecological framework of the european common agricultural policy medde 2012 then for each spatial configuration three maps were produced in which all fields non selected as permanent meadows were set as either herbitill noherbi till or herbi notill thus a total of 600 maps corresponding to the five field structures the four pm proportion the 10 replicates and the three crop land uses with the third set of maps we explored the effect of the spatial fragmentation of meadows as described by roques and stoica 2007 the level of fragmentation was defined by considering the ratio of neighbours with a similar land use to the maximum possible number of similar neighbours for each field structure spatial configurations were generated using a saa with two simultaneous targets 50 area under meadows and either a low lowfrag configurations or a high highfrag configurations fragmentation value with ten replicates of each case 100 spatial configurations see fig 4 for some example of maps because the fragmentation also depends on fields shape and distribution specific low and high fragmentation values were used for each field structure see details in appendix a for the definition of the fragmentation value for 19 of the 100 cases the saa did not converge to the desired fragmentation value and the corresponding spatial configurations were discarded in the 81 remaining cases the low fragmentation value was 0 160 0 004 mean sd and the high fragmentation value 0 243 0 006 zonal configurations zones were also generated by dividing the field structure into two equal parts by latitude or longitude with a complete spatial segregation of the meadows 20 spatial configurations exploring the four possible configurations for each field structure fig 4 the exact position of the rectilinear separation was defined with a saa to respect 50 area under meadows the mean fragmentation value for these segregated maps was 0 104 0 030 then for each spatial configuration three maps were produced in which all non meadow fields were set as either herbitill noherbi till or herbi notill 303 maps fig 5 presents a schematic representation of the land use map generation procedure with the example of the zonal configurations 2 8 3 simulations the three crop land uses herbitill noherbi till or herbi notill correspond to dynamical agricultural systems see sections 2 3 and 2 4 for each field defined as herbitill noherbi till or herbi notill by the land use map generation procedure the model determines each year if it is a spring or a winter crop and if it is as tilled or not according to the definition of its land use table 1 thus although the map of land uses is constant over time the maps of spring versus winter crops and of tilled field are changing each year to account for this stochastic component ten simulation runs were performed for each one of the generated land use maps with a 50 years simulation duration fig a1 in appendix a 2 9 statistical analyses for each simulation and each weed species functional type seed and plant densities were averaged over the last 10 years of the run and over all pixels for each land use similar calculations were performed on the cumulative number of seeds and the cumulative number of plants for all four species functional types together to generate two summary variables for weed abundance total seed density and total plant density therefore each simulation simplified output corresponded to one value for each one of the following 10 response variables the seed and plant densities of the four species functional types considered separately and the total seed and plant densities together referred to as weed density for simplicity all subsequent analyses were performed on these 10 response variables we used linear models to analyse how land use type and field structures affected weed density in reference situations we then analysed the effect of the proportion of permanent meadows on weed density in crops by fitting linear models including the pm proportion crop land use herbitill noherbi till or herbi notill in the landscape and field structure as qualitative explanatory variables for graphical representation of the pm proportion effect on weed density we calculated centred partial regression coefficients sum to zero contrasts to allow for the interpretation of main effects in the presence of interactions schielzeth 2010 in addition the large number of simulations would make the detection of significant relationships likely even in the case of small effects we therefore also calculated an effect size as the ratio of weed density for each pm proportion over weed density in the reference situation without pm similarly we analysed the effect of the proportion of pm in the landscape on weed density in pm fields the effect size was calculated using 100 pm simulations as the reference we then assessed the effect of the spatial distribution of meadows on weed density for each land use with linear models including the different fragmentation levels three level factor zones lowfrag and highfrag the crop land use present in the landscape and field structure as explanatory variables and calculated centred partial regression coefficients to represent the effect of the fragmentation levels we also calculated an effect size as the ratio of weed density in lowfrag and highfrag situations relative to weed density in zone situations similarly we analysed the effect of the fragmentation level on weed density in pm fields the model implementation appendix b the landscape generation procedure and all statistical analyses were performed with r software version 3 2 5 r core team 2016 3 results in homogeneous landscapes reference situations with either 0 or 100 pm the spatial seed dispersal process did not modify the relative weed densities between land uses defined by the local demographic parameters values fig 6 crops without herbicide noherbi till had the highest densities followed by crops with herbicide and tillage herbitill and then crops without tillage herbi notill the permanent meadows habitat had a very low mean weed density less than one plant per m² between land use density patterns were similar for both seeds and plants and for the four species functional types fig a2 in appendix a finally plant density of wintersmall and springsmall species functional types always converged to one plant m 2 in pm land use 3 1 effect of the proportion of permanent meadows in the landscape increasing the proportion of permanent meadows significantly reduced total mean seed density in crops as a result of a significant reduction in seeds of wintersmall and winterlarge species functional types table 2 fig 7 a however this variation was much smaller than the differences between crop land uses with an effect size always close to 1 table 3 there was no significant effect of increasing pm proportion on mean plant density in crops table 2 fig 7c conversely decreasing the proportion of pm i e increasing the proportion of crop land uses significantly increased both seed and plant densities for all weed species functional types within pm fields table 2 fig 7b and d this effect size on seed density ranged between 1 2 and 2 2 whereas the absolute plant density value in pm fields was less affected than seed density with a maximal effect size of 1 1 table 3 the field structure also significantly affected weed densities in pm 3 2 effect of spatial aggregation of land uses the spatial aggregation of land uses had no significant effect neither on seed nor on plant densities in crops table 4 fig 8 a and c by contrast increasing the level of fragmentation significantly increased both seed and plant densities in permanent meadows table 4 fig 8b and d the effect size comparing weed seed density in highfrag and lowfrag situations to the zones reference situation ranged between 1 1 and 1 7 table 5 the effect size for weed plant density was smaller with a maximum value of 1 1 in addition the variability of plant density in meadows increased with the level of fragmentation figs a5 and a6 in appendix a indicating that the pattern of assignment of fields to land uses in different simulations affected the impact of crop habitats on semi natural habitats both seed and plant densities in meadows were also significantly affected by the field structure 4 discussion we evaluated the contribution to annual arable weed management of including semi natural habitats in agricultural landscapes by implementing a spatially explicit landscape scale model of annual weed population dynamics taking cropping systems into account including the crop rotation tillage regime mechanical weeding and herbicide use this model showed that changing the proportion of permanent meadows or their spatial arrangement in the landscape only slightly modified the seed density of annual weeds in crops and had no effect on annual weed plant density yet the range of meadow proportions was large with a highest value of 50 this confirms empirical studies that have shown a marginal effect of landscape characteristics compared to that of local field management ekroos et al 2010 hawes et al 2010 petit et al 2016 as expected weed seed density in crops decreased with increasing meadow proportion as this semi natural habitat is unsuitable for the annual arable weeds modelled here moonen and marshall 2001 meiss et al 2010 cordeau et al 2012 there was no significant effect of the spatial aggregation of meadows on annual weed densities in crops weed density in meadows was more strongly affected by the reciprocal effects of crop proportion and spatial arrangement although absolute values were always low in this habitat unfavourable for annual weed species arable weeds are characterised by a short dispersal range relatively to the landscape scale that we considered e g bischoff 2005 which may explain why weed population dynamics is only weakly affected by such large scale landscape properties however even a step by step dispersal may produce spatial pattern at large scale ricci et al 2013 and indeed our model generated significant spatial effects in terms of composition pm proportion spatial organisation of fields field structure effect and spatial organisation of land uses concerning the field structure effect there was no apparent link between weeds density and field structure properties in terms of field number or field shape although the limited number of field structures considered precluded the formal testing of such relationships the low effect size associated to landscape composition and configuration may also reflect the rapid temporal dynamics of agricultural landscapes for which habitat suitability maps vary continuously over years benoît et al 2012 this may counteract the effect of the spatial dissemination process particularly for weed species that have adapted to these rapid temporal changes by developing temporal dispersal through a large seed bank the role of the seed bank was tested in this model with simulations including very small seed bank i e 90 germination rate and 99 mortality of non germinated seeds results not shown the effects on plants were of the same intensity as those on seeds the presence of a seed bank seems to smooth effects between years with a semi natural habitat having a strong effect on some fields due to the crop type and practices present but with smaller effects in other years the weed density of the four species functional types in crops did not react equally to landscape modifications with only wintersmall and winterlarge weed density in crops exhibiting a response to landscape composition namely species functional types more adapted to winter crops figs a3 a6 in appendix a indeed the observed effects mainly resulted from situations where the non pm land use type was either herbitill or herbi notill two land uses defined with respectively 75 and 66 of expected winter crops in the temporal crop sequence thus our model suggests that species that are more adapted to a crop type frequent in the crop successions would be more sensitive to spatial effect than species adapted to a less frequent crop type in analyses of field data the major determinants of weeds communities are the local crop characteristics and weed abundance which respond principally to local factors petit et al 2016 some known landscape effects on weed abundances are near landscape effects bohan and haughton 2012 corresponding to the specific effects of neighbouring fields or border types alignier et al 2013 which were not modelled here larger scale landscape properties were frequently related to weed community structure for example the proportion of a crop in the landscape was shown to be negatively related to weed diversity suggesting that the introduction of semi natural habitats might increase diversity petit et al 2013 even if the effect on the relative mean seed density was often small or insignificant increasing pm proportion increased the between simulation variability of annual weed abundance in crops situations in which land uses are more scattered may therefore increase the effect of one land use on the other one however weed seed abundance was also more variable in fragmented landscapes than in landscapes in which land uses were totally segregated spatially thus the exact spatial position of the fields assigned to each land use may be at least as important as the level of aggregation this effect may reflect the impact of the matrix an extremely unfavourable habitat which depends on field size and shape two factors determining the length of the interface between the field habitat and the matrix habitat a well known landscape effect ricketts 2001 a similar mechanism may account for the effect of field structure on annual weed abundance in homogeneous landscapes 5 conclusion in this model based study we found that introducing permanent meadows into the landscape decreased annual arable weed densities in crops to a much lesser extent than the adoption of particular cropping systems for weed species already widespread over the entire landscape even with effective seed dispersal the spatial dispersal process appeared to have a smaller effect on population dynamics than local factors and temporal dispersal suggesting that the spatial organisation of cropping systems and semi natural habitat would not be a major lever to manage weed abundances in crops we focused here on mean annual arable weed densities over large scales however given the production of large amounts of weed seeds and the persistence of the seed bank baker 1974 weed management strategies in arable crops also aim to control the temporal variability of weed densities and particularly the risk of high level of infestation in a particular field colbach and sache 2001 a component which merits additional investigations with the present landscape scale model i e the spatiotemporal variability of weed densities in a given cropping system for widespread species we suggest as an interesting complementary approach that the effects of nearby landscape features such as sown grass strips grass margins or hedgerows on the risk of infestation should be modelled for different types of cropping systems and annual arable weed management strategies the model described here could also be used for studies of newly introduced species the spread of which may be more influenced by landscape composition and arrangement at a large scale von der lippe et al 2013 acknowledgements this work

25248,finding efficient and environmentally sustainable methods for arable weed management is a current challenge in agroecosystems weed species disperse over scales larger than the field landscape scale management could therefore reinforce field scale strategies for innovative cropping systems in particular the introduction of semi natural habitats such as permanent meadows which are unsuitable habitats for annual arable weeds could potentially reduce weed densities in crops we developed a spatially explicit landscape scale model of annual arable weed population dynamics including the main components of weed management at cropping system level crop rotation tillage regime intensity of herbicide use and mechanical weeding the variability of responses to these factors for different weed species functional types was considered by modelling four functional response groups we used this model to investigate the effects of increasing the proportion of permanent meadows in the landscape and of the spatial arrangement of meadows on weed density in crops with this model increasing the proportion of permanent meadows significantly decreased mean seed density of weeds in crops furthermore weed density in crops was found to be lower for landscapes in which the meadows were scattered rather than clustered together in large zones however these spatial and landscape scale effects were much weaker than the local effect of cropping systems weed density in permanent meadows was more sensitive to the proportion of meadows and to their spatial arrangement than weed density in crops although the absolute value of weed density remained low in this unfavourable habitat keywords virtual landscape population dynamics crops rotation tillage herbicides 1 introduction in agroecosystems the management of weed populations in crops is challenging due to the need to limit weed impact on production whilst conserving weed contribution to biodiversity marshall et al 2003 mézière et al 2015 the limitation of crop yield by weeds is often related to local infestations which may occur in a given year due to weed management failure the control of weed abundance in cropped fields is mostly achieved through field scale management which can be highly reliant on herbicide use or more integrated i e mobilizing cropping practices that have an impact on weed population dynamics e g crop rotation sowing time management and mechanical weeding chikowo et al 2009 however annual arable weeds disperse beyond the edge of the field benvenuti 2007 alignier and petit 2012 and therefore it is questionable whether weed management should not be thought at multiple scales from the field to the wider landscape petit et al 2011 2013 there is strong empirical evidence that the characteristics of the landscape surrounding a cropped fields affects its in field weed richness and composition gaba et al 2010 alignier et al 2013 henckel et al 2015 but the effect of landscape scale drivers on weed abundance is much less documented studies that have simultaneously explored the contribution of field management and landscape context on weed abundance suggest that the impact of landscape scale factors is marginal compared to the effect of local field management ekroos et al 2010 hawes et al 2010 petit et al 2016 recent national scale british analyses provide correlative evidence that weed abundance is positively affected by field size alignier et al 2017 the diversity of landscape elements surrounding arable field bohan and haughton 2012 and the proportion cover of cropped area in the wider landscape surrounding the field alignier et al 2017 the existence of such correlative patterns raises the question of the contribution of weed dispersal processes to the local dynamics of weed populations in arable fields annual arable weed species are characterised by high levels of seed production and long term seed viability baker 1974 and this temporal dispersal explains that modelling approaches are often adopted to assess the long term effect of field management on weed abundances sester et al 2007 colbach et al 2014 in such models the level of herbicide use the nature of soil tillage operations and the crop rotation are among the key field management factors that drive weed dynamics gardarin et al 2007 2012 weeds response to these management factors depends on some of their biological characteristics mainly germination period seed size buhler 1995 gunton et al 2011 addressing the potential contribution of weed dispersal to local annual arable weed abundance would require to expand existing modelling frameworks in space in order to account for weed spatial dispersal but also to explicitly consider the temporal dynamics of the landscape dynamic landscapes few studies have adopted spatially explicit modelling approaches to assess the dynamics of annual arable weeds at the landscape scale existing studies considered only one species and a small number of agricultural practices perry and gonzalez andujar 1993 gonzalez andujar and perry 1995 dauer et al 2009 gonzález diáz et al 2012 2015 or focused exclusively on the effects of neighbouring fields gonzalez et al 2001 and none of these models specifically represented cropping systems in these models crop type directly determined the set of population dynamics parameters with at best the possibility of varying herbicide use intensity whereas tillage regime which is known to impact the local weed dynamics was never taken into account there is thus a need for a modelling framework that simultaneously considers dispersal processes over a large landscape wide scale and realistic cropping system with a balance between simplicity and realism to prevent the final model becoming too complex and intractable holst et al 2007 in this paper we propose a modelling framework to address the question of the relative contribution of weed dispersal to annual arable weed abundances in contrasted scenarios of landscape composition and configuration weed abundance is modelled for four types of annual arable weed species or virtual species that differ for their germination period and seed size two characteristics that are related both to intrinsic demographic parameters bond 2008 odera systèmes 2014 and to weed response to cropping systems buhler 1995 gunton et al 2011 cropped areas in the landscape are three types of realistic cropping systems no tillage systems with high level of herbicides systems including tillage and non chemical weeding and classical systems including both tillage and herbicide applications we consider a fourth habitat type permanent meadows considered to be much less suitable than arable crops for the annual arable weeds modelled here moonen and marshall 2001 meiss et al 2010 cordeau et al 2012 the framework is then used to explore contrasting scenarios to test the following hypotheses i increasing the proportion of unsuitable habitat in the landscape significantly decreases weed infestation in crops ii this effect is magnified if the unsuitable habitat is scattered fragmented throughout the landscape rather than clustered together 2 materials and methods 2 1 agronomical practices we focused on three main management options that drive weed population dynamics sowing time soil tillage regime and herbicide use intensity and modelled functional species types that respond differently to these three determinants sowing time is a determinant factor in the selection of the weed species able to grow in a given crop resulting in contrasting weed floras in winter and spring crops milberg et al 2001 a trait based analysis revealed that crop sowing period was a better predictor of the composition of weed communities than crop type gunton et al 2011 similarly the dichotomy between winter and spring crops has been identified as the most explanatory and predictive variable in species distribution models outcompeting the full crop list and other more detailed classifications of crop types alignier et al 2013 the type of mechanical operations applied to the soil has a major impact on the weed seed bank in particular inversion tillage is designed to aerate the soil and to improve its structure it involves turning over the uppermost 20 40 cm of the soil with a plough and has major consequences for the distribution of seeds in the soil yenish et al 2016 cardina et al 2002 sester et al 2006 and for germination rate gardarin et al 2010 showed that the maximal shoot and root lengths of weeds which determine the maximum depth from which a seed can germinate are positively related to seed weight species with low or high seed weights would therefore be expected to respond differently to inversion tillage large seed would be expected to have better germination rates at greater depths gardarin et al 2011 cordeau et al 2015 whereas small seeds preferentially germinate close to the soil surface this hypothesis was confirmed by the observation that tillage reduction is followed by a decline in weed species with large seeds buhler 1995 in addition seed production the quantity of seed produced by a given plant and seed mortality are also related to seed weight bond 2008 odera systèmes 2014 finally we considered that the herbicide use intensity often characterized through the treatment frequency index an indicator which quantifies the number of recommended doses applied to each hectare oecd 2001 directly modulates the plant mortality rate 2 2 species functional types we considered four functional types of weed species defined according to their preferential germination in winter or spring crops and seed size wintersmall winterlarge springsmall and springlarge doing this we distinguished i between winter weed species those growing preferentially in winter crops and spring weed species that differ in terms of germination rate proportion of germinating seeds and ii between small seed species 5 mg and large seed species 5 mg that differ in terms of germination rate seed mortality odera systèmes 2014 and seed production bond 2008 examples of species of each functional types are wintersmall alopecurus myosuroides capsella bursa pastoris and viola arvensis winterlarge veronica hederifolia fallopia convolvulus and galium aparine springsmall chenopodium album persicaria maculosa and solanum nigrum springlarge convolvulus arvensis and ambrosia trifida 2 3 agricultural systems and response of the species functional types in real agricultural landscapes the above described agronomical practices sowing time soil tillage regime and herbicide use intensity are not determined separately but are rather part of an agricultural system we here combined these three drivers of weed dynamics to define three contrasted and realistic cropping systems observed in agricultural landscapes of europe and north america crops with tillage and herbicide use herbi till crops without herbicide use noherbi till and crops without tillage and with herbicide use herbi notill the following paragraph describes their detailed characteristics based on real combination of practices in french commercial farms the herbitill system was considered to have a crop succession with mainly winter crops 3 years out of four and few spring crops with a frequent use of tillage half of winter crops and one fourth of spring crops in herbitill system are tilled each year in this system herbicide use combined with possible mechanical weeding operations were considered to remove 75 of the weed species with a phenology similar to that of the crop i e wintersmall and winterlarge in winter crops and springsmall and springlarge in spring crops conversely the noherbi till system was considered to have half of spring crops in their crop succession spring crops being systematically tilled and winter crops never tilled weed management of this system based solely on mechanical weeding was considered less efficient mortality 60 in both noherbi till and herbitill systems weed plants with a phenology different from that of the crop were considered to be largely destroyed by sowing for winter weeds in spring crops or harvesting for spring weeds in winter crops operations before seed production mortality 90 herbi notill were considered to have an intermediate use of spring crops one year out of three and to never use tillage in this system the absence of mechanical operations in herbi notill fields was considered to be compensated by greater herbicide use killing 95 of all weed plants table 1 finally unlike the three crop land uses permanent meadows pm were assumed to be long term stable and unsuitable habitats for annual arable weeds because the well established dense grass cover and successive mowing should limit the growth rate of weed populations by decreasing plant growth e g teasdale and frank 1983 and seed production e g mertens and jansen 2002 and through interception of the seed rain e g doisy et al 2014 2 4 landscape definition and dynamics in the modelling framework developed a landscape is defined as a mosaic of polygonal field plots each assigned a land use type either herbi till noherbi till herbi notill or pm the first three land uses are considered to be crop land uses each year every field which is assigned one of the three types of crop land uses is defined as either spring crop or winter crops and either tilled or not according to the definition of the land uses table 1 thus for a given landscape the map of land uses is constant over time whereas the maps of spring versus winter crops and of tilled field are changing each year between field zones were considered to be homogeneous and are referred to as the landscape matrix 2 5 population dynamics model the population dynamics model is based on a raster representation of the landscape with a resolution of 3 m using a one year time step the local dynamics population growth for each pixel of the raster is dependent on ecological parameters that are in turn dependent on land use in the pixel and the type of weed species newly produced seeds disperse further over the landscape according to a dispersal kernel local weed population dynamics depends on five parameters seed mortality rate sm germination rate gr plant mortality rate pm seed production sp number of seeds produced per plant and carrying capacity k maximal adult plant density each year a proportion 1 sm of viable seeds either germinates with a proportion gr to produce plants or remains in the seed bank with proportion 1 gr as a result of natural mortality and weed management practices a proportion pm of plants dies and the surviving plants proportion 1 pm each produce sp new seeds that disperse according to a bivariate student s distribution 2dt clark et al 1999 to enter the seed bank fig 1 plant density is limited by carrying capacity k therefore over a raster corresponding to a domain a x y the local densities number per m² of seeds st and plants pt at year t at the pixel location x y are driven by the following equations 1 p t x y min k t x y 1 s m t x y g r t x y 1 p m t x y s t 1 x y 2 s t x y 1 s m t x y 1 g r t x y s t 1 x y x y a p t x y s p t x y f 2 d t x x y y 3 f 2 d t x y b 1 π a ² 1 x 2 y ² a ² b eq 1 corresponds to number of plants that emerge from the seed bank left after weeding and limited by the carrying capacity the first part of eq 2 describes the number of seeds that remains alive in the seedbank while its second parts corresponds to the dispersal in the 2dt distribution eq 3 a is a scale parameter and b is a parameter that determines the weight of the distribution tail to ensure that the density limitation of weed plants also depend on the effects mentioned above the carrying capacity k was defined as a function of the species functional type s the land use l the crop type c and

demographic parameters are completely determined by i land use herbi till noherbi till herbi notill or pm ii crop type winter or spring and iii the presence or absence of tillage a reference value for each of the demographic parameters sm gr pm and sp for each of the four species functional types was obtained through a literature survey infloweb 2014 odera systèmes 2014 gonzález diáz et al 2012 gardarin et al 2011 2010 2012 bond 2008 fumanal et al 2007 sester et al 2006 grundy et al 2003 freckleton and watkinson 1998 perry and gonzalez andujar 1993 roberts and feast 1972 see table a1 in appendix a and adapted according to land use crop type and the presence or absence of tillage to represent the effects described above table 1 because the local dynamics is determined by field properties at a given time step all the pixels of a given field have the same land use type crop type and tillage value and therefore the same values of demographic parameters conversely the plant and seed densities could vary over the pixels of a given field as a result of the dispersal process dispersal was parameterized using established relationships between plant traits maximal plant height and seed mass and dispersal distances thomson et al 2010 2011 to 15 current weed species either anemochorous or zoochorous over this set of species the calculated average mean and maximal distances were respectively 1 3 m and 71 1 m table a2 in appendix a to fit with this order of magnitude the 2dt dispersal function eq 3 was parametrized with a 0 01 and b 0 72 which corresponded to a mean dispersal of 1 5 m and 99 of dispersal events occurring over distances of less than 66 m 2 7 initialization for each of the four land uses we first ran the local demographic model without dispersal over 150 years with 10 replicates per land uses with an initial seed density of 2 seeds m 2 of each species functional type convergence was reached after less than 100 years as a result of the definition of local parameters mean densities of plants and seeds converged to a non zero value except for winterlarge and springlarge species functional types in meadows which is consistent with experimental studies showing that weed species with large seeds are not favoured in habitat without tillage and or with permanent cover cordeau et al 2015 for all subsequent simulations the initial seed density of each land use was chosen as the mean seed density over the last 50 years of this initialization run the spatial distribution of initial seed density is thus determined by the spatial distribution of land uses 2 8 landscape generation and simulation plan 2 8 1 field structures we used a set of five maps with contrasting spatial patterns of field plots hereafter referred to as field structures to account for sources of variability associated with field size distribution the spatial distribution of fields within the landscape and the geometric properties of fields these structures covered the gradients of mean field area and total number of fields fig 2 each field structure corresponded to a 4 4 km sample from the land parcel identification system official european geographic database for payments to farmers in the framework of the common agricultural policy for the côte d or area france with these field structures three sets of land use maps were produced 2 8 2 land use maps the first set of maps consisted of homogeneous maps in which all the fields are assigned the same land use 20 maps corresponding to each of the four land uses over the five field structures this corresponded to a reference situations with either 0 or 100 of permanent meadows the second set of maps was dedicated to studying the effect of the proportion of permanent meadows we used a simulated annealing algorithm saa to generate spatial configurations with either 3 10 25 or 50 area of permanent meadows 10 replicates each see fig 3 for some map examples the lowest proportion corresponds to the minimum area under meadow for a farm to receive conditional subsidiaries through the ecological framework of the european common agricultural policy medde 2012 then for each spatial configuration three maps were produced in which all fields non selected as permanent meadows were set as either herbitill noherbi till or herbi notill thus a total of 600 maps corresponding to the five field structures the four pm proportion the 10 replicates and the three crop land uses with the third set of maps we explored the effect of the spatial fragmentation of meadows as described by roques and stoica 2007 the level of fragmentation was defined by considering the ratio of neighbours with a similar land use to the maximum possible number of similar neighbours for each field structure spatial configurations were generated using a saa with two simultaneous targets 50 area under meadows and either a low lowfrag configurations or a high highfrag configurations fragmentation value with ten replicates of each case 100 spatial configurations see fig 4 for some example of maps because the fragmentation also depends on fields shape and distribution specific low and high fragmentation values were used for each field structure see details in appendix a for the definition of the fragmentation value for 19 of the 100 cases the saa did not converge to the desired fragmentation value and the corresponding spatial configurations were discarded in the 81 remaining cases the low fragmentation value was 0 160 0 004 mean sd and the high fragmentation value 0 243 0 006 zonal configurations zones were also generated by dividing the field structure into two equal parts by latitude or longitude with a complete spatial segregation of the meadows 20 spatial configurations exploring the four possible configurations for each field structure fig 4 the exact position of the rectilinear separation was defined with a saa to respect 50 area under meadows the mean fragmentation value for these segregated maps was 0 104 0 030 then for each spatial configuration three maps were produced in which all non meadow fields were set as either herbitill noherbi till or herbi notill 303 maps fig 5 presents a schematic representation of the land use map generation procedure with the example of the zonal configurations 2 8 3 simulations the three crop land uses herbitill noherbi till or herbi notill correspond to dynamical agricultural systems see sections 2 3 and 2 4 for each field defined as herbitill noherbi till or herbi notill by the land use map generation procedure the model determines each year if it is a spring or a winter crop and if it is as tilled or not according to the definition of its land use table 1 thus although the map of land uses is constant over time the maps of spring versus winter crops and of tilled field are changing each year to account for this stochastic component ten simulation runs were performed for each one of the generated land use maps with a 50 years simulation duration fig a1 in appendix a 2 9 statistical analyses for each simulation and each weed species functional type seed and plant densities were averaged over the last 10 years of the run and over all pixels for each land use similar calculations were performed on the cumulative number of seeds and the cumulative number of plants for all four species functional types together to generate two summary variables for weed abundance total seed density and total plant density therefore each simulation simplified output corresponded to one value for each one of the following 10 response variables the seed and plant densities of the four species functional types considered separately and the total seed and plant densities together referred to as weed density for simplicity all subsequent analyses were performed on these 10 response variables we used linear models to analyse how land use type and field structures affected weed density in reference situations we then analysed the effect of the proportion of permanent meadows on weed density in crops by fitting linear models including the pm proportion crop land use herbitill noherbi till or herbi notill in the landscape and field structure as qualitative explanatory variables for graphical representation of the pm proportion effect on weed density we calculated centred partial regression coefficients sum to zero contrasts to allow for the interpretation of main effects in the presence of interactions schielzeth 2010 in addition the large number of simulations would make the detection of significant relationships likely even in the case of small effects we therefore also calculated an effect size as the ratio of weed density for each pm proportion over weed density in the reference situation without pm similarly we analysed the effect of the proportion of pm in the landscape on weed density in pm fields the effect size was calculated using 100 pm simulations as the reference we then assessed the effect of the spatial distribution of meadows on weed density for each land use with linear models including the different fragmentation levels three level factor zones lowfrag and highfrag the crop land use present in the landscape and field structure as explanatory variables and calculated centred partial regression coefficients to represent the effect of the fragmentation levels we also calculated an effect size as the ratio of weed density in lowfrag and highfrag situations relative to weed density in zone situations similarly we analysed the effect of the fragmentation level on weed density in pm fields the model implementation appendix b the landscape generation procedure and all statistical analyses were performed with r software version 3 2 5 r core team 2016 3 results in homogeneous landscapes reference situations with either 0 or 100 pm the spatial seed dispersal process did not modify the relative weed densities between land uses defined by the local demographic parameters values fig 6 crops without herbicide noherbi till had the highest densities followed by crops with herbicide and tillage herbitill and then crops without tillage herbi notill the permanent meadows habitat had a very low mean weed density less than one plant per m² between land use density patterns were similar for both seeds and plants and for the four species functional types fig a2 in appendix a finally plant density of wintersmall and springsmall species functional types always converged to one plant m 2 in pm land use 3 1 effect of the proportion of permanent meadows in the landscape increasing the proportion of permanent meadows significantly reduced total mean seed density in crops as a result of a significant reduction in seeds of wintersmall and winterlarge species functional types table 2 fig 7 a however this variation was much smaller than the differences between crop land uses with an effect size always close to 1 table 3 there was no significant effect of increasing pm proportion on mean plant density in crops table 2 fig 7c conversely decreasing the proportion of pm i e increasing the proportion of crop land uses significantly increased both seed and plant densities for all weed species functional types within pm fields table 2 fig 7b and d this effect size on seed density ranged between 1 2 and 2 2 whereas the absolute plant density value in pm fields was less affected than seed density with a maximal effect size of 1 1 table 3 the field structure also significantly affected weed densities in pm 3 2 effect of spatial aggregation of land uses the spatial aggregation of land uses had no significant effect neither on seed nor on plant densities in crops table 4 fig 8 a and c by contrast increasing the level of fragmentation significantly increased both seed and plant densities in permanent meadows table 4 fig 8b and d the effect size comparing weed seed density in highfrag and lowfrag situations to the zones reference situation ranged between 1 1 and 1 7 table 5 the effect size for weed plant density was smaller with a maximum value of 1 1 in addition the variability of plant density in meadows increased with the level of fragmentation figs a5 and a6 in appendix a indicating that the pattern of assignment of fields to land uses in different simulations affected the impact of crop habitats on semi natural habitats both seed and plant densities in meadows were also significantly affected by the field structure 4 discussion we evaluated the contribution to annual arable weed management of including semi natural habitats in agricultural landscapes by implementing a spatially explicit landscape scale model of annual weed population dynamics taking cropping systems into account including the crop rotation tillage regime mechanical weeding and herbicide use this model showed that changing the proportion of permanent meadows or their spatial arrangement in the landscape only slightly modified the seed density of annual weeds in crops and had no effect on annual weed plant density yet the range of meadow proportions was large with a highest value of 50 this confirms empirical studies that have shown a marginal effect of landscape characteristics compared to that of local field management ekroos et al 2010 hawes et al 2010 petit et al 2016 as expected weed seed density in crops decreased with increasing meadow proportion as this semi natural habitat is unsuitable for the annual arable weeds modelled here moonen and marshall 2001 meiss et al 2010 cordeau et al 2012 there was no significant effect of the spatial aggregation of meadows on annual weed densities in crops weed density in meadows was more strongly affected by the reciprocal effects of crop proportion and spatial arrangement although absolute values were always low in this habitat unfavourable for annual weed species arable weeds are characterised by a short dispersal range relatively to the landscape scale that we considered e g bischoff 2005 which may explain why weed population dynamics is only weakly affected by such large scale landscape properties however even a step by step dispersal may produce spatial pattern at large scale ricci et al 2013 and indeed our model generated significant spatial effects in terms of composition pm proportion spatial organisation of fields field structure effect and spatial organisation of land uses concerning the field structure effect there was no apparent link between weeds density and field structure properties in terms of field number or field shape although the limited number of field structures considered precluded the formal testing of such relationships the low effect size associated to landscape composition and configuration may also reflect the rapid temporal dynamics of agricultural landscapes for which habitat suitability maps vary continuously over years benoît et al 2012 this may counteract the effect of the spatial dissemination process particularly for weed species that have adapted to these rapid temporal changes by developing temporal dispersal through a large seed bank the role of the seed bank was tested in this model with simulations including very small seed bank i e 90 germination rate and 99 mortality of non germinated seeds results not shown the effects on plants were of the same intensity as those on seeds the presence of a seed bank seems to smooth effects between years with a semi natural habitat having a strong effect on some fields due to the crop type and practices present but with smaller effects in other years the weed density of the four species functional types in crops did not react equally to landscape modifications with only wintersmall and winterlarge weed density in crops exhibiting a response to landscape composition namely species functional types more adapted to winter crops figs a3 a6 in appendix a indeed the observed effects mainly resulted from situations where the non pm land use type was either herbitill or herbi notill two land uses defined with respectively 75 and 66 of expected winter crops in the temporal crop sequence thus our model suggests that species that are more adapted to a crop type frequent in the crop successions would be more sensitive to spatial effect than species adapted to a less frequent crop type in analyses of field data the major determinants of weeds communities are the local crop characteristics and weed abundance which respond principally to local factors petit et al 2016 some known landscape effects on weed abundances are near landscape effects bohan and haughton 2012 corresponding to the specific effects of neighbouring fields or border types alignier et al 2013 which were not modelled here larger scale landscape properties were frequently related to weed community structure for example the proportion of a crop in the landscape was shown to be negatively related to weed diversity suggesting that the introduction of semi natural habitats might increase diversity petit et al 2013 even if the effect on the relative mean seed density was often small or insignificant increasing pm proportion increased the between simulation variability of annual weed abundance in crops situations in which land uses are more scattered may therefore increase the effect of one land use on the other one however weed seed abundance was also more variable in fragmented landscapes than in landscapes in which land uses were totally segregated spatially thus the exact spatial position of the fields assigned to each land use may be at least as important as the level of aggregation this effect may reflect the impact of the matrix an extremely unfavourable habitat which depends on field size and shape two factors determining the length of the interface between the field habitat and the matrix habitat a well known landscape effect ricketts 2001 a similar mechanism may account for the effect of field structure on annual weed abundance in homogeneous landscapes 5 conclusion in this model based study we found that introducing permanent meadows into the landscape decreased annual arable weed densities in crops to a much lesser extent than the adoption of particular cropping systems for weed species already widespread over the entire landscape even with effective seed dispersal the spatial dispersal process appeared to have a smaller effect on population dynamics than local factors and temporal dispersal suggesting that the spatial organisation of cropping systems and semi natural habitat would not be a major lever to manage weed abundances in crops we focused here on mean annual arable weed densities over large scales however given the production of large amounts of weed seeds and the persistence of the seed bank baker 1974 weed management strategies in arable crops also aim to control the temporal variability of weed densities and particularly the risk of high level of infestation in a particular field colbach and sache 2001 a component which merits additional investigations with the present landscape scale model i e the spatiotemporal variability of weed densities in a given cropping system for widespread species we suggest as an interesting complementary approach that the effects of nearby landscape features such as sown grass strips grass margins or hedgerows on the risk of infestation should be modelled for different types of cropping systems and annual arable weed management strategies the model described here could also be used for studies of newly introduced species the spread of which may be more influenced by landscape composition and arrangement at a large scale von der lippe et al 2013 acknowledgements this work

25249, stoichiometric homeostasis is the degree to which organisms maintain a constant chemical composition in the face of variations in the chemical composition and availability of their environmental resources most stoichiometric models have assumed constant nutrient contents in heterotrophs called strict homeostasis and varied nutrient contents in autotrophs called non homeostasis due to the fact that the stoichiometric variability of heterotrophs is often much less than that of autotrophs the study for the hard dynamical threshold under sufficient light in wang et al 2012 suggested that the strict homeostasis assumption is reasonable when the stoichiometric variability of herbivores is less than the hard dynamical threshold in this paper we explore the light dependent case that results in homoclinic and heteroclinic bifurcations from which we obtain the weak dynamical threshold which is normally larger than the hard dynamical threshold with the weak dynamical threshold the strict homeostasis assumption is more likely valid which further confirms the conclusion that strict homeostasis of herbivores can be assumed for most herbivores homoclinic heteroclinic bifurcations are not only exciting dynamics in mathematics but also important indicators for the robustness of empirical studies experimental results are highly sensitive when homoclinic or heteroclinic orbits occur keywords ecological stoichiometry strict homeostasis weak dynamical threshold stoichiometric variability homoclinic heteroclinic paradox of enrichment 1 introduction ecological stoichiometry is the study of the balance of energy and nutrient elements in trophic interactions sterner and elser 2002 stoichiometric models incorporate flows of energy or c and nutrient elements such as n or p into population dynamics many existing stoichiometric producer grazer models have assumed constant nutrient contents in herbivores called fixed stoichiometry or strict homeostasis andersen 1997 hessen and bjerking 1997 elser and urabe 1999 loladze et al 2000 muller et al 2001 wang et al 2008 peace et al 2014 some other models have examined phytoplankton bacteria interactions and assumed strict homeostasis in bacteria bratbak and thingstad 1985 wang et al 2007 alijani et al 2015 as a conclusion most existing stoichiometric models assume variable stoichiometry in autotrophs but fixed stoichiometry in heterotrophs under the strict homeostasis assumption for heterotrophs these models suggested new insights into how energy flow and nutrient cycling regulate predator prey trophic interactions for example when autotrophs are severely nutrient limited heterotrophs are often limited by nutrients as well and may even go extinct despite an abundance of food andersen 1997 hessen and bjerking 1997 loladze et al 2000 muller et al 2001 wang et al 2007 2008 wang 2010 mathematically complex dynamics such as attracting limit cycles bistability or chaos can appear under stoichiometric constraints loladze et al 2000 deng and loladze 2007 wang et al 2008 2009 however strict homeostasis is only an approximation and is often not supported by empirical studies as consumers consistently display some small changes in body elemental composition in response to stoichiometric variation in their diet demott et al 1998 acharya et al 2004 hood and sterner 2010 these studies motivate us to ask how the strict homeostasis assumption used in stoichiometric trophic interaction models regulates population dynamics the degree of homeostasis itself ranges widely exhibiting variation even among clones as well as among species in the model herbivore daphnia experiments in demott et al 1998 showed that the p content of daphnia magna decreased from 1 55 to 1 11 when feeding on p deficient diets experiments in hood and sterner 2010 showed that the p content of daphnia pulex in high p treatments can be three times in low p treatments on the other hand daphnia parvula exhibited strong homeostasis under the same condition changing less than 0 2 therefore though heterotrophs are more homeostatic than autotrophs persson et al 2010 the widely used homeostasis assumption in stoichiometric models needs to be carefully examined in the past decade some theoretical studies have developed a new generation of stoichiometric models with nonhomeostatic herbivores grover 2003 mulder and bowden 2007 mulder 2007 wang et al 2012 grover 2003 developed a chemostat multinutrient model of bacterial prey and a flagellate predator by assuming that both predator and prey have variable stoichiometry mulder and bowden 2007 mulder 2007 examined how quantitative results of existing theoretical models change after relaxing the strict homeostasis assumption recently with sufficient light wang et al 2012 obtained the hard dynamical threshold below which the strict homeostasis assumption is reasonable this threshold is independent of algal stoichiometric variability thus the historic reasoning for strict homeostasis in heterotrophs is not convincing this study suggested that the strict homeostasis assumption is valid for many herbivores except for herbivores with small mortality rates and this assumption is more likely valid in nutrient poor environments the two nutrient model in wang et al 2012 showed that herbivore s survival needs higher variation in the more potentially limiting of the two elements all these studies reach the same conclusion that theoretical results can be different if we consider nonhomeostatic elemental composition in herbivores the main goal of this paper is to explore how the dynamics of trophic interactions depend on the degree of stoichiometric variability in herbivores when the light dependence is considered incorporating light into the stoichiometric model leads to homoclinic and heteroclinic bifurcations and we explore their dependence on consumer stoichiometric variability the obtained threshold is called weak dynamical threshold which is normally larger than the hard dynamical threshold in wang et al 2012 experimental results become highly sensitive when homoclinic or heteroclinic cycles appear in this paper we first incorporate the light dependence explicitly into our model in wang et al 2012 we then examine how the stoichiometric variability of herbivores affects predator prey dynamics estimating the weak dynamical threshold for the appearance of homoclinic and heteroclinic cycles 2 model derivation we explicitly incorporate light and energy flow into the closed nutrient model with variable consumer stoichiometry in wang et al 2012 the variables are the concentration of the nutrient element p phosphorus r phytoplankton carbon biomass a with p c ratio q a and herbivore carbon biomass h with p c ratio q h see table 1 we apply the lambert beer s law to keep track of light intensity and the liebig s law of minimum for multiple limiting elements phosphorus and light energy for both growths of the producer and the grazer the light dependent algal growth term is μ a min 1 q a min q a 1 z m 0 z m i z a i z a l dz a and the energy dependent herbivore s growth term is min μ h 1 q h min q h e ˆ f a h of course the corresponding cell quota dilution terms need to be changed accordingly consequently we obtain the following stoichiometric model with energy flow and nutrient p cycling 1 dr dt ρ a q a r a σ h a q a q h h q a d a a q h d h h 2 da dt μ a min 1 q a min q a 1 z m 0 z m i z a i z a l dz a f a h d a a 3 dq a dt ρ a q a r μ a min 1 q a min q a 1 z m

x a 1 and the stoichiometric variability of herbivores as η h x h 1 let tr t r t a t qa t h t qh t be the total nutrient p in the system at time t then 12 dtr dt dr dt da dt q a a dq a dt dh dt q h h dq h dt 0 by substituting all equations into the derivatives hence the total nutrient p in the system follows the law of mass conservation that is tr t is a constant independent of t and tr r 0 a 0 qa 0 h 0 qh 0 we can reduce the system by one dimension as in wang et al 2012 and we can change the total nutrient p availability in the system by varying r 0 in simulations 3 theoretical results in this paper we take daphnia as the herbivore and p as the only limiting nutrient element we present estimation of parameters and initial conditions in table 1 all these parameter values except stoichiometric variabilities have been estimated in existing modeling papers bratbak and thingstad 1985 loladze et al 2000 wang et al 2008 2009 2012 we run simulations for two nutrient statuses low and high for each nutrient status we explore the effects of light and herbivore s stoichiometric variability on population dynamics via sample solutions and bifurcation diagrams because homoclinic and heteroclinic bifurcations will occur we pose their definitions as follows 1 homoclinic bifurcation is a global bifurcation which occurs when a periodic orbit coincides with a saddle point 2 heteroclinic bifurcation is a global bifurcation involving a heteroclinic orbit that connects two or more equilibrium points in the oligotrophic case r 0 0 01 we vary the light intensity and plot sample solutions in figs 1 and 2 fig 1 illustrates an approximation of a homoclinic orbit which leads to a infinite period bifurcation one important consequence of such large oscillations is population extinction due to stochastic factors as the light intensity increases we can observe from fig 2 that the solution curves will be farther away from a homoclinic orbit when the light intensity is not too low the solution curves follow the regular predator prey dynamics figs 3 and 4 sketch bifurcation diagrams for a wide range and a narrow range of the light intensity fig 3 shows that the amplitude of the predator prey cycle shrinks as the light intensity increases this new finding opposite to results found in classical predator prey models partly solves rosenzweig s paradox of enrichment when we zoom into the low light intensity part we can observe from fig 4 that several homoclinic and heteroclinic bifurcations occur we sketch all possible homoclinic heteroclinic bifurcations on the two dimensional parameter space in fig 5 we vary both the light intensity i in and the stoichiometric variability of herbivores η h we observe that homoclinic heteroclinic bifurcations occur in the parameter region when i in 10 μmol photons m2 s and η h 99 actually if we consider figs 3 and 5 together homoclinic heteroclinic bifurcations occur when the light intensity is between two thresholds that is i min i in i max fig 5 shows that the weak dynamical threshold is 99 much larger than the hard dynamical threshold 67 indicated as the yellow vertical line in fig 5 hence the hard dynamical threshold is more crucial for the validity of the strict homeostasis assumption for herbivores in the region where homoclinic heteroclinic bifurcations occur experimental results are highly sensitive as we have encountered in elser s lab in 2006 wang et al 2009 and in 2012 an unpublished experiment even in the presence of reasonably high quality food see the eutrophic case below it is possible for herbivores to go extinct via falling into a homoclinic orbit this shows the importance of considering the stoichiometric variability of herbivores in the eutrophic case we illustrate from fig 6 that a homoclinic orbit can occur even under strong light in fig 7 we sketch a two dimensional bifurcation diagram to show when homoclinic heteroclinic bifurcations can occur in comparison to the low nutrient case fig 5 the high nutrient case has the weak dynamical threshold 79 closer to the hard dynamical threshold and a larger light lower bound i min the locations of homoclinic heteroclinic bifurcations in the high nutrient case are more spread out on the two dimensional parameter space than in the low nutrient case this observation means that experimental results are more sensitive in an eutrophic case than in an oligotrophic case when the stoichiometric variability of herbivores is above the weak dynamical threshold 4 discussion the validity of the strict homeostasis assumption is worth questioning by ignoring the potential light limitation in wang et al 2012 the strict homeostasis assumption works well when the stoichiometric variability of herbivores is less than the hard dynamical threshold in this paper we extend the stoichiometric model in wang et al 2012 with light energy introduction of light and energy flow creates very complex and interesting dynamics such as homoclinic and heteroclinic orbits here we define a new threshold for the validity of the strict homeostasis assumption called the weak dynamical threshold which is defined by the appearance of homoclinic heteroclinic bifurcations the weak dynamical threshold for herbivore s stoichiometric variability is 79 99 as opposed to the hard dynamical threshold 67 with the weak dynamical threshold the strict homeostasis assumption is more likely valid which further confirms the conclusion that strict homeostasis of herbivores can be assumed for most herbivores homoclinic heteroclinic bifurcations are not only exciting dynamics in mathematics but also important indicators for the robustness of experimental results even in the presence of reasonably high quality food it is still possible for herbivores to go extinct with small stochasticity via falling into a homoclinic orbit this is a remarkable situation for empirical studies experimental results can be highly sensitive when homoclinic heteroclinic bifurcations occur as we have encountered in two almost identical stoichiometric experiments in 2006 wang et al 2009 and in 2012 an unpublished experiment both experiments were performed in elser s lab but the outcomes were quite different in comparison a much higher percentage of microcosms have the extinction of daphnia in the 2012 s experiment than in the 2006 s experiment these empirical studies verify our experimental robustness hypothesis on homoclinic heteroclinic orbits loladze et al 2004 showed an apparent exception to the competitive exclusion principle two herbivores can coexist at a stable equilibrium while preying on one species of algae and being limited by the same nutrient in the prey we have the conjecture that the stoichiometric variability of herbivores can facilitate the coexistence of even more herbivore species on one species of algae due to the complexity of dynamics this is an open problem for future

25249, stoichiometric homeostasis is the degree to which organisms maintain a constant chemical composition in the face of variations in the chemical composition and availability of their environmental resources most stoichiometric models have assumed constant nutrient contents in heterotrophs called strict homeostasis and varied nutrient contents in autotrophs called non homeostasis due to the fact that the stoichiometric variability of heterotrophs is often much less than that of autotrophs the study for the hard dynamical threshold under sufficient light in wang et al 2012 suggested that the strict homeostasis assumption is reasonable when the stoichiometric variability of herbivores is less than the hard dynamical threshold in this paper we explore the light dependent case that results in homoclinic and heteroclinic bifurcations from which we obtain the weak dynamical threshold which is normally larger than the hard dynamical threshold with the weak dynamical threshold the strict homeostasis assumption is more likely valid which further confirms the conclusion that strict homeostasis of herbivores can be assumed for most herbivores homoclinic heteroclinic bifurcations are not only exciting dynamics in mathematics but also important indicators for the robustness of empirical studies experimental results are highly sensitive when homoclinic or heteroclinic orbits occur keywords ecological stoichiometry strict homeostasis weak dynamical threshold stoichiometric variability homoclinic heteroclinic paradox of enrichment 1 introduction ecological stoichiometry is the study of the balance of energy and nutrient elements in trophic interactions sterner and elser 2002 stoichiometric models incorporate flows of energy or c and nutrient elements such as n or p into population dynamics many existing stoichiometric producer grazer models have assumed constant nutrient contents in herbivores called fixed stoichiometry or strict homeostasis andersen 1997 hessen and bjerking 1997 elser and urabe 1999 loladze et al 2000 muller et al 2001 wang et al 2008 peace et al 2014 some other models have examined phytoplankton bacteria interactions and assumed strict homeostasis in bacteria bratbak and thingstad 1985 wang et al 2007 alijani et al 2015 as a conclusion most existing stoichiometric models assume variable stoichiometry in autotrophs but fixed stoichiometry in heterotrophs under the strict homeostasis assumption for heterotrophs these models suggested new insights into how energy flow and nutrient cycling regulate predator prey trophic interactions for example when autotrophs are severely nutrient limited heterotrophs are often limited by nutrients as well and may even go extinct despite an abundance of food andersen 1997 hessen and bjerking 1997 loladze et al 2000 muller et al 2001 wang et al 2007 2008 wang 2010 mathematically complex dynamics such as attracting limit cycles bistability or chaos can appear under stoichiometric constraints loladze et al 2000 deng and loladze 2007 wang et al 2008 2009 however strict homeostasis is only an approximation and is often not supported by empirical studies as consumers consistently display some small changes in body elemental composition in response to stoichiometric variation in their diet demott et al 1998 acharya et al 2004 hood and sterner 2010 these studies motivate us to ask how the strict homeostasis assumption used in stoichiometric trophic interaction models regulates population dynamics the degree of homeostasis itself ranges widely exhibiting variation even among clones as well as among species in the model herbivore daphnia experiments in demott et al 1998 showed that the p content of daphnia magna decreased from 1 55 to 1 11 when feeding on p deficient diets experiments in hood and sterner 2010 showed that the p content of daphnia pulex in high p treatments can be three times in low p treatments on the other hand
