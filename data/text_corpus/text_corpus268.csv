1340,underground thermal energy storage utes can contribute to renewable energy usability especially in urban areas with the most demand and available infrastructure but utes may interact in those areas with non aqueous phase liquids napl by increasing the temperature in storage formations to determine temperature effects on napl dissolution rates into groundwater the effective specific interfacial area anw between trichloroethylene tce and water as a function of temperature and tce pore saturations was calculated the interfacial tension between the flushing solution and the napl the adsorption coefficient and the retardation of a reactive tracer were determined by the drop weight method and interfacial tracer tests at 10 c 30 c and 60 c from 10 to 60 c anw increased by a factor of six to eight based on the results a function to describe the anw between tce and water was developed which could improve numerical models on napl dissolution rates the main mechanisms for the increase in anw are suggested to be napl blob migration on pore scale and thermal induced changes in wettability and in blob shape correlating with a temperature induced decline in effective porosity of up to 32 these results contribute to the understanding and predictability of utes in contaminated aquifers the general response of napl behavior on artificial increasing aquifer temperatures and the improvement of thermal and other groundwater remediation techniques keywords napl water interfacial area temperature impacts on organic contaminants aquifer thermal energy storage ground water remediation 1 introduction storage technologies are crucial in renewable energy production due to fluctuations in energy availability one fully developed technology which is already available enables the storage of thermal energy in shallow aquifers this technology could increase near surface groundwater temperatures depending on the amount of stored heat with temperatures of up to 90 c recorded in heat well surrounding groundwater mangold et al 2002 sommer et al 2013 urban and industrial areas which have a high demand for heat energy are predestinated for larger storage plants because of the pre existing heat supply infrastructure and the short distances between the heat source the storage site and the consumer however the occurrence of non aqueous phase liquids napl and the corresponding plumes is considered an obstruction to underground thermal energy storage utes in urban areas vdi 4640 2001 so far due to uncertainties in the effect of temperature on contamination spreading behavior and the release into groundwater and soil vapor in germany more than 300 000 known sites are contaminated by napl of which more than 50 are chlorinated hydrocarbons chcs due to their relatively high solubility compared to other common organic contaminants and low degradation rates chcs can have dissolved plumes of up to a few kilometers long grandel and dahmke 2008 therefore huge volumes of shallow aquifer are not directly available for utes temperature affects the interaction between organic contaminants in the subsurface and the surrounding environment including dissolution koproch et al 2019 imhoff et al 1997 sorption desorption bell and leboeuf 2013 gas phase development krol et al 2011 and biodegradation fletcher et al 2011 ni et al 2015 ni et al 2016 beyer et al 2016 there has been considerable research into the effect of elevated temperatures on these processes however there are few investigations into how temperature influences the dissolution process in permeable porous media to develop a differentiated assessment involving all the relevant temperature processes on the behavior of organic contaminant distribution parameterization of napl dissolution in permeable porous media at elevated temperatures is required the dissolution of napls is a kinetic process driven by the difference between the concentration at the napl interface the aqueous solubility and the compound specific concentration of the surrounding water it can be determined by the following equation miller et al 1990 powers et al 1992 imhoff et al 1993 1 f k c c sat a nw where f is the interphase mass flux mg l 1 min 1 k is the intrinsic mass transfer coefficient cm min 1 c csat is the concentration difference between the dissolved organic liquid and the aqueous solubility mg l 1 koproch et al 2019 and anw is the specific interfacial area cm2 cm 3 which is the ratio between the interfacial area and the volume of the porous medium the interfacial area is difficult to measure especially at the field scale therefore mass transfer characteristics are often described as part of the lumped or bulk mass transfer coefficient powers et al 1992 to gain a fundamental understanding of the overall napl dissolution rate at the microscale several studies have been conducted to quantify the mass transfer characteristics cho et al 2005 grant and gerhard 2007 pan et al 2007 and napl mass removal rates noordman et al 2000 corapcioglu et al 2009 as a function of the interfacial area the total interfacial area is determined by the morphology of napl blobs the interfacial area is larger if an organic liquid is divided in small blobs and lays thinly spread inside the pore network than if napl exist as multi pore ganglia or pools saripalli 1997 however not all napl water surfaces are hydraulically connected to mobile water the effective interfacial area which includes all those surfaces involved in mass transfer is affected by the napl blob distribution inside the pore structure on a macro and microscale as a direct response to heterogenic napl distribution local preferential flow paths develop farthing et al 2012 and divide the napl source zones into regions of different discharge rates dissolution fingering on the microscale the total napl surface inside the pore network can be separated into different regions based on the dynamics of the water flow field corapcioglu et al 2009 and the position of the various napl blobs inside the pore network kennedy and lennox 1997 the most important regions affecting napl dissolution behavior are the napl surfaces exposed to mobile water these are the major contributors to napl mass removal as napl blobs in this region dissolve relatively fast in several dissolution experiments a sharp drop off in aqueous concentrations were observed mahal et al 2010 due to the shrinking of blobs in this region the portions of napl surface with less accessibility to flowing water which accounts for of up to 70 of the total napl volume in columns filled with homogenous glass beads johns and gladden 1999 were located in dead end pores or blocked by other napl blobs corapcioglu et al 2009 napl surfaces in contact with grains were not significantly involved in napl dissolution and therefore mass transfer from such regions is low based on the idea of different degrees of mobile water accessibility two blob classes have been defined and successfully applied with different mass transfer coefficients for the improvement of existing numerical models by reproducing those regions popp et al 2016 napl blobs can appear as single blobs or can be connected as multipore blobs or ganglia the development and distribution of which is strongly affected by napl saturation 27 thus anw is also a function of napl saturation and has been shown to increase at higher residual saturations saripalli 1997 cho and annable 2005 schnaar and brusseau 2006 local napl distribution and the ratio between wetting and non wetting fluid trapped inside the pore network is determined by the capillary pressure saturation relationship davis 1994 the capillary pressure pc can be calculated using the young laplace equation 2 p c 2 γ cosθ r where γ is the interfacial tension between two phases θ is the contact angle through the water phase and r is the radius of the capillary tube hence organic liquid water interfacial areas are the result of a complex interplay between porous media characteristics fluid parameters and the interaction between the fluids all of them in different quantities are sensitive to variations in temperature there have been no studies describing the effect of temperature on interfacial areas between organic liquids and the flowing water phase by direct measurements previous studies have focused on the influence of temperature on the bulk mass transfer coefficient imhoff et al 1997 illangasekare et al 2006 consisting of the intrinsic mass transfer coefficient and the effective interfacial area offering a more specific approach on mass transfer characteristics at elevated temperatures the main objective of this study was to investigate the temperature influence on the interfacial area between trichloroethylene tce and water using interfacial tracer tests ift to calculate anw the interfacial tension between the organic liquid and water is required so new data for temperature affected interfacial tension between tce and water was generated using the drop weight method lee et al 2009 2 material methods the ift is frequently used to determine the anw between water and an organic phase cho and annable 2005 saripalli 1997 kim et al 1997 setarge et al 1999 rao et al 2000 brusseau et al 2010 this technique is based on a monolayer adsorption of an anionic surfactant on the surface area of an organic liquid the equilibrium of adsorption between the aqueous tracer solution and the organic phase is described by the gibbs adsorption equation saripalli 1997 kim 1997 and is expressed by the adsorption coefficient ki cm which is a measure of how many molecules can adsorb per specific napl surface area as follows 3 k i 1 2 rt γ c t c c0 where c0 mol ml 1 is the tracer inflow concentration t k is the temperature r j mol k is the universal gas constant γ dyn cm 1 is the interfacial tension between the flushing solution and the napl and c mol ml 1 is the tracer concentration γ as a function of c which is needed for the calculation of the adsorption coefficient ki can be obtained using the drop weight method lee et al 2009 due to the adsorption of the surfactant on the organic liquid surface the reactive tracer solution retards relative to a conservative constituent retardation is described by the following equation saripalli 1997 4 r ift μ ift μ con 1 a nw k i ω w ρ k s ω w where ift and con describe interfacial and conservative tracers respectively μ is the area above the normalized breakthrough curve for a continuous tracer test anw cm2cm 3 is the interfacial area between the fluids per volume of porous media ρ is the porous media bulk density g cm 3 and ωw is the volumetric water content the latter term of eq 4 considers that adsorption of the anionic surfactant on the porous media matrix anw can then be calculated from rearranging eq 4 as follows 5 a nw r ift 1 ρ k s ω w ω w k i interfacial tracer tests were performed in vertical orientated stainless steel columns with a length of 15 cm and a diameter of 3 2 cm analytical grade tce merck kgaa darmstadt germany was used as a representative napl and technical grade sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate sdbs sigma aldrich co llc as a reactive or interfacial tracer an sdbs inflow concentration of 0 52 mm was chosen this is below the critical micelle concentration cmc of 1 6 mm at 20 c tahirat et al 2011 where molecules start to build up intermolecular connections for higher temperatures cmc increases sowada 1980 so no experimental difficulties were expected due to micelle bonding technical grade lithium bromide merck with a concentration of 40 mg l 1 0 5 mm was used as a non reactive tracer sdbs and bromide concentrations were analyzed by measuring electrical conductivity wtw cond 197i probe tetracon 325 as no other components contributed to electrical conductivity the tracer tests with sdbs and bromide were performed separately regression lines for sdbs and bromide calibration showed a good fit for both substances r2 of 0 99 fig 1 all measurements for calibrations and for samples were made at 20 c quartz sand schlingmeier schwülper germany with particle sizes between 0 2 mm and 0 8 mm was used as the porous medium according to the manufacturer the sand has a uniformity index of 62 and a specific surface area of 58 cm2 g 1 for every test performed the effective porosity was calculated using an 1d analytical solution of the transport equation for confined homogenous and isotropic boundary conditions the sand was sieved by a 0 1 mm mesh and washed by ultrapure deionized water 0 055 μs cm 1 di to remove adsorbed ions from the particle surfaces the sand was washed until the recharged water had an electrical conductivity of 5 μs cm 1 for a rapid development of a parallel flow field inside the column 1 cm of the column was filled with gravel 2 mm washed by ultrapure deionized water an externally prepared mixture of tce quartz sand and di was quickly poured into the column while stirring with a glass rod to mobilize possible air inclusions to adjust tce pore saturations to between 0 05 and 0 15 the volume of added tce ranged from 2 ml to 6 ml the ift experiments were performed at 10 c 30 c and 60 c table 1 in a refrigerator and a heating chamber respectively 60 c and 30 c represent typical temperatures which can be found around the hot area of utes used for heat exchange and the surrounding thermally affected areas the sdbs and bromide solution were pumped through the columns separately one after another by a peristaltic pump ismatec ecoline vc ms ca8 6 with a water flow rate of 1 6 ml min 1 which corresponds to a flow velocity of 10 m d 1 at the column outflow a pressure valve with 0 3 bar was adjusted to suppress gas phase development at higher temperatures all experiments were carried out by running the sdbs tracer test first and the bromide tracer second tracer tests were performed until the outflow concentration equaled the inflow concentration for several consecutive sampling times so that an adjustment of the adsorption equilibrium was assured afterwards the columns were rinsed again with di water weighted outflow fractions were used to calculate the overall flow volume in the run up to the series of tce consisting ifts two experiments with the same experimental setup as the ift itself were carried out without tce at two temperatures 20 c and 55 c to measure the background adsorption of sdbs onto porous medium and column assembly interfacial tension as a function of temperature and tracer concentration was measured by the drop weight method lee et al 2009 for 10 c 30 c and 60 c the tce phase 0 2 ml was injected into the aqueous sdbs solution by a gas tight glass syringe with a circular tube while injecting the number of tce drops formed during the injection was counted to calculate an average drop volume this value was used to calculate the interfacial tension using the formula described in lee et al 2009 aqueous sdbs solutions were prepared in concentrations ranging from 0 without sdbs mmol l 1 to 1 mmol l 1 the tce phase inside the gas tight glass syringe and sdbs solutions were heated or cooled to the desired temperature the drop weight method was performed in a refrigerator for measurements at 10 c and in a heating chamber for those at 30 c and 60 c a digital thermometer monitored temperatures of aqueous solutions with an accuracy of 0 1 c 3 results 3 1 interfacial tension and adsorption coefficient the interfacial tensions derived by the drop weight method were used to 1 to identify new data on the temperature effects on the interfacial tension between water and tce and 2 to calculate the adsorption coefficient ki which is necessary in eq 5 to determine anw the primary outcome of this study 1 the measurements made by the drop weight method showed linearly decreasing interfacial tensions between water and tce with temperature increases from 10 c to 30 c and 60 c fig 2 this observation mostly concurs with the measurements between perchloroethylene pce and water39 between 20 c and 80 c however the interfacial tension between tce and water in this study decreases roughly eight times faster than between pce and water40 γtce 45 88 0 34 t γpce 45 81 0 04 t the results also showed a slightly decreasing slope of the linear regressions when the sdbs concentration is increasing fig 2 2 the measured interfacial tension γ between tce and the aqueous solution decreased with increasing sdbs concentration c in a logarithmic manner for every investigated temperature fig 3a and can be described by γ α βln c this is comparable to observations made at 25 c cho and annable 2005 saripalli et al 1998 therefore the term δγ δc in eq 3 to calculate the adsorption coefficient ki can be described by the derivation of γ α βln c the ki value was then calculated by replacing δγ δc with β c 0 to 6 k i 1 2 rt β c 0 by using the β values 4 13 for 10 c 3 67 for 30 c and 2 51 for 60 c r2 between 0 95 and 0 97 of the logarithmic regression curve of the measured interfacial tension as a function of sdsb concentration the adsorption coefficient ki was observed to decrease with increasing temperatures table 1 fig 3b this indicates that less molecules of the surfactant can adsorb per specific napl surface area with increasing temperature similar observations were made for adsorption isotherms of dissolved tce on activated carbon erto et al 2009 the small variations in ki at one temperature see table 1 differences are too small to be obvious in fig 4b are due to small differences in influent tracer concentration fig 4 a interfacial tension γ as a function of sdbs concentration for 10 c 30 c and 60 c b adsorption coefficient ki as a function of temperature 3 2 tce water interfacial area as a function of tce saturation and temperature breakthrough curves from the tracer experiments without tce in the sediment showed less adsorption of sdbs on the sediment matrix compared to the experiments with tce in the sediment matrix with retardation of 1 060 at 20 c and 1 052 at 55 c respectively the effect of temperature on sdbs retardation caused by the sediment matrix is therefore comparatively small and the background retardation value was set to 1 06 which was subtracted from the result of every experiment it is to be expected that the background retardation during the further experiments was even lower due to a shielding of the sediment matrix by napl depending on napl saturation however this effect is small in relation to the retardation due to adsorption onto tce retardation became evident in breakthrough curves as tce was added to the column fig 5 increasing the temperature then had a considerable effect on retardation indicated by the breakthrough curves in fig 5 based on the measured sdbs retardation anw was calculated to be 40 cm2cm 3 at 10 c 67 cm2cm 3 at 30 c and 341 cm2cm 3 at 60 c at comparable tce saturations of close to 10 see table 1 on average the anw at 60 c for similar tce saturations were 220 cm2cm 3 320 cm2cm 3 larger than at 10 c a factor of six to eight however the effect of temperature on anw was significantly smaller between 10 c and 30 c where differences ranged between 6 cm2cm 3 and 51 cm2cm 3 table 1 fig 5 the same phenomenon was observed when the tce saturation was increased between lower 4 5 5 and higher 12 5 15 tce saturations the largest increase in anw of 74 cm2cm 3 from 280 cm2cm3 to 354 cm2cm 3 was observed at 60 c table 1 fig 5 whereas at 10 c and 30 c this increase was lower of approximately 35 cm2cm 3 and 50 cm2cm 3 respectively to functionally describe the measured results it was considered that the anw sn relation must go through zero a logarithmic regression curve to describe the relationship between anw and sn can be calculated by the following equation 7 a nw a ln s n b this was then fitted to the measured data for every temperature fig 6 this data is comparable to previous studies that measured anw as a function of napl saturation by a power law function of 0 66 cho et al 2005 saripalli 1997 to derive a single function that describes eq 7 for every temperature the a and b values from eq 7 were plotted against temperature from each logarithmic regression curve of the anw sn plot fig 6a both values increase exponentially with increasing temperatures the constants a and b in eq 7 were replaced by the temperature dependent exponential relationships obtained from fig 6a 8 a nw 4 47 e 0 039 t ln s n 18 68 e 0 04 t the function described in eq 8 accurately reproduces the measured anw at 10 c except at the point of tce pore saturation of 15 3 and has an overall r2 of 0 96 fig 6b at 30 c the function overestimates and at 60 c the function underestimates the measured anw values slightly however the function follows the trend of the measured anw relatively well and has an overall r2 of 0 77 and 0 73 respectively since the water accessibility to napl in the pore space decreases at higher napl saturations decreasing anw can be assumed for tce pore saturations higher than those investigated here so the validity of the derived function is limited to the investigated napl saturation 3 3 changes in effective porosity the effective porosity neff for the used sand was found to be 0 315 on average for experiments without tce table 1 in all experiments with integrated tce neff showed a declining trend with increasing tce pore saturation while the extend of this decline is at 2 13 near the anticipated range for 10 and 30 c due to pore space reduction by the added napl neff decrease for 60 c is at 11 38 much stronger especially at higher tce pore saturations table 1 fig 7 the presumed processes for this stronger neff decrease at 60 c are discussed in chapter 4 3 4 discussion in this study the effective interfacial area increased by a factor of eight between 10 c and 60 c in the following subsections possible implications on the napl water interfacial areas are discussed 4 1 temperature impact on organic liquid density and implications for napl blob geometry organic liquid densities decrease with increasing temperature yaws 2009 this leads to an increase in volume for napl blobs trapped in porous medium known as thermal swelling thermal swelling accounts for some of the increases measured in anw but the resulting volume increase of 7 between 10 c and 60 c leads to an increased surface area of just 5 for ideal spheres however even if a calculated increase in volume due to thermal swelling was just 7 single blobs in pore throats or ganglia could have been pressed or elongated into the next pore leading to the development of multipore blobs this reorganization could also contribute to larger surface areas cho and annable 2005 since multipore blobs have less sphericity and a larger specific interfacial area compared to singlet pore blobs zhang et al 2002 4 2 temperature impact on contact angle and wettability the effects of temperature on the contact angle are compound specific and depend on the solid phase wang and gupta 1995 for a crude oil brine quartz system wang and gupta found that the contact angle increased with temperature but decreased in a carbonate system hackett 2007 observed a decreasing contact angle for a pce water quartz system in micromodels while the contact angle increased for a tce water quartz system with increasing temperature in a study based on fitted capillary pressure saturation curves from silica filled columns the contact angle of pce was calculated to increase up to 40 between 20 c and 60 c she and sleep 1998 less spherical napl blobs and an increase in the napl wet surface fraction are followed by an increase in the contact angle changes in wettability resulted in a significantly different shaped curve for the anw of decane and water in interfacial tracer experiments during primary drainage jain et al 2003 in flow cell experiments the anw for residual hydrocarbons increased by approximately 44 as sand was napl wetted from 0 to 100 raoush 2009 increases in wettability due to higher temperatures directly influences napl geometry and blob distribution and consequently anw 4 3 temperature influences on interfacial tension and capillary pressure and implications for local napl distribution in this study the interfacial tension between tce and water decreased by 35 between 10 c and 60 c fig 2 this is consistent with previous research sleep and ma 1997 that measured a 58 reduction in the interfacial tension between water and voltesso 35 a representative lnapl between 20 c and 90 c based on the lower interfacial tension the capillary pressure was supposed to be significantly smaller at higher temperatures derived from capillary pressure saturation curves davis 1994 and she and sleep 1998 found that capillary pressure decreased by 50 to 66 in napl water quartz systems between 20 c and 80 c for a paraffinic oil and pce respectively therefore one significant pull force in the direction of pore throats was reduced at higher temperatures this also affects the curvature of the vaulted interface between an organic liquid and water in a capillary tube the degree of which is directly proportional to the capillary pressure niessner 2009 leharne 2019 consequently a decrease in capillary pressure as caused by increased temperatures allows napl blob retraction from hydraulically poor connected pore throats in the direction of hydraulically well connected pore centers this is thought to be the predominant mechanism of increasing anw during the interfacial tracer tests napl blob retraction could then open the hydraulic pathways initially blocked by tce blobs thereby improving contact of tce blobs to mobile water this would be in accordance with the study by popp et al 2016 that fit a numerical model to experimental derived dissolution rates by increasing anw and thus the portion of well connected napl to flowing water by about 22 for 40 c compared to 10 c the concept of temperature induced changes in the proportion of napl regions in contact to mobile water is also applicable to the capillary pressure saturation analysis made by davis 1994 and she and sleep 1998 who showed that a lower amount of residual organic non wetting phase will be retained in porous media at higher temperatures in particular the displacement of napl blobs from pore throats in direction of pore centers also correlates with the detected temperature induced reductions of neff at 60 c 4 4 napl mobilization an increase in temperature leads to a number of parameter changes which can also alter the potential of napl displacement of the residual phase this mainly affects the viscosity density surface tension capillary pressure maximum residual napl saturation contact angle and capillary number most of these changes tend to favor napl mobilization however chcs are not expected to mobilize with increasing temperature because water viscosity decreases more quickly than the interfacial tension for those substances with water sleep and ma 1997 a measure for residual napl mobilization is the total trapping number nt which can be simplified for vertical flow conditions as follows pennel et al 1996 9 n t n ca n b where nca is the capillary number eq 10 which relates viscosity to capillary forces and nb is the bond number eq 11 which represents the ratio of the buoyancy to capillary forces pennell et al 1996 aydin et al 2011 the critical value of nt required to initiate organic liquid mobilization is stated as 10 5 whereby higher values represent higher mobility nca and nb can be calculated by pennell et al 1996 aydin et al 2011 10 n ca q w μ w γ cos θ 11 n b ρgk k rw γ cos θ where qw is the darcy velocity of the aqueous phase cm s 1 μw is the dynamic viscosity of the aqueous phase dyn s cm 2 δρ is the density difference of the napl and the aqueous phase g is the gravitational acceleration k is the intrinsic permeability and krw is the relative permeability of the aqueous phase the values of nca and nb were calculated by using the measured interfacial tension fig 3a with viscosities taken from yaws 2009 and assuming θ 0 for 10 c medium is water wet and an increase in θ of 0 38 c as observed in micromodels for tce in water hackett 2007 k and krw were based on the experimental conditions set as 10 7 cm2 and 0 9 mean respectively taking into account that krw is sensitive to wetting conditions seyededabbasi et al 2008 which have been indicated to be variable with temperature krw may also be sensitive to temperature however it did not have a significant effect on these calculations in this experimental system the nt were 4 4 10 6 at 10 c 4 1 10 6 at 40 c and 3 6 10 6 at 60 c respectively these values are comparable to other reported trapping numbers of the order of 10 6 for residual toluene aydin et al 2011 based on these calculations mobilization of the residual tce phase could not be expected to occur only because of elevated temperatures because the calculated nt are all two orders of magnitude below the critical value for mobilization even at high temperatures this concurs with calculations from sleep and ma sleep and ma 1997 that showed similar nca values between 20 c and 90 c for pce at a darcy velocity of 1 m d 1 in conclusion increasing the temperature in the interfacial tracer tests results in significantly higher anw but did not lead to down or upwards mobilization of the residual tce phase however solvent mixtures are frequently present at some chc sites and their ift depends on the specific composition seo and mccray 2002 therefore and as a next step the temperature induced mobilization potential for napl mixtures should be evaluated experimentally and theoretically on the basis of single component characteristics 5 conclusions napl mass flow in soil and groundwater is subject to a complex interaction between various processes and parameters most of these are affected by temperature increases as well as the effective interfacial area anw which increases with temperature in this study increases between 10 c and 30 c were comparatively small in the order of 16 to 50 whereas between 10 c and 60 c anw increased by a factor of eight based on several tracer experiments a temperature variable function to estimate the interfacial area of tce was developed eq 8 using tce saturations between 5 and 15 well sorted sand and temperatures of 10 c 30 c and 60 c although the validity of the relationships represented here is limited to the boundary conditions and the sediment used these results demonstrate the significant impact of elevated temperatures at the interface between grains the organic and water phase and their local distribution to each other further investigations should evaluate how strong the temperature effect on anw depends on sediment specific and temperature dependent parameters like capillary pressure wettability and contact angle increasing the temperature especially to temperatures of 60 c and probably higher leads to significantly improved hydraulic contact between a napl and the flowing water phase napl migrates on a pore scale from dead end pores and pore throats towards pore centers the predominant mechanism behind this are suggested to be thermally induced changes in wettability and blob shape following the concept of two blob classes popp et al 2016 the proportion of fast dissolving blobs increases with increasing temperature as a result of both processes longer contact time due to increased contact area between the napl and the flowing water contributes to accelerated dissolution and an increasing mass transfer rate into the aqueous phase therefore the application of utes to contaminated sites and increasing temperatures could reduce the lifetime of long term contaminants additionally the effect of increased mass transfer due to increased anw at higher temperatures also enhances thermal remediation approaches or other techniques like pump treat air stripping or chemical methods compared to the strong increases in anw the thermally induced decreases in neff are small but should also be considered for groundwater flow on a larger scale however if the total effective surface area is large enough that contact time is sufficient to reach equilibrium dissolution may be limited by solubility the decreasing tce solubility between 10 c and 40 c koproch et al 2019 could mean that even if the dissolution rate increases by increasing temperature mass transfer can decrease due to limited solubility whether aqueous contaminant concentrations increase or decrease depends on the respective predominant process which in turn is dependent on site specific prevailing sediments and napl distribution due to the hydraulic heterogeneity of natural aquifers enhanced kinetic dissolution because of increased anw and equilibrium dissolution are assumed to take place in parallel further studies for heterogeneous systems are required to understand these interactions utes in urban areas could play an important role in the transition of energy supplies from fossil fuels to renewable sources in particular contaminated aquifers offer storage space that is frequently available and excluded from drinking water production as a result they could serve as energy storage reservoirs providing a new and important function in climate and resource protection and revitalization existing thermal remediation approaches heron et al 2006 operate at temperatures between 70 c and 120 c and the effectiveness of other remediation strategies such as enhanced natural attenuation ni et al 2016 kosegi et al 2000 and in situ chemical oxidation johnson et al 2011 is potentially enhanced at elevated temperatures this illustrates the potential for combining utes and groundwater remediation nevertheless there is a risk of increased mass flow from the source zone to deal with such risks the technological and administrative methodologies have to be adapted detailed knowledge about napl mass flows at elevated temperatures and the derived constitutive relations as developed here for anw can help predict manage and remediate the effects of geothermal installations or utes applications in contaminated urban areas to increase the reliability of predictive models to such an extent that applications meet official requirements and to build confidence among companies and authorities further field studies are

1340,underground thermal energy storage utes can contribute to renewable energy usability especially in urban areas with the most demand and available infrastructure but utes may interact in those areas with non aqueous phase liquids napl by increasing the temperature in storage formations to determine temperature effects on napl dissolution rates into groundwater the effective specific interfacial area anw between trichloroethylene tce and water as a function of temperature and tce pore saturations was calculated the interfacial tension between the flushing solution and the napl the adsorption coefficient and the retardation of a reactive tracer were determined by the drop weight method and interfacial tracer tests at 10 c 30 c and 60 c from 10 to 60 c anw increased by a factor of six to eight based on the results a function to describe the anw between tce and water was developed which could improve numerical models on napl dissolution rates the main mechanisms for the

remediation 1 introduction storage technologies are crucial in renewable energy production due to fluctuations in energy availability one fully developed technology which is already available enables

solubility compared to other common organic contaminants and low degradation rates chcs can have dissolved plumes of up to a few kilometers long grandel and dahmke 2008 therefore huge volumes of shallow aquifer are not directly available for utes temperature affects the interaction between organic contaminants in the subsurface and the surrounding environment including dissolution koproch et al 2019 imhoff et al 1997 sorption desorption bell and leboeuf 2013 gas phase development krol et al 2011 and biodegradation fletcher et al 2011 ni et al 2015 ni et al 2016 beyer et al 2016 there has been considerable research into the effect of elevated temperatures on these processes however there are few investigations into how temperature influences the dissolution process in permeable porous media to develop a differentiated assessment involving all the relevant temperature processes on the behavior of organic contaminant distribution parameterization of napl dissolution in permeable porous media at elevated temperatures is required the dissolution of napls is a kinetic process driven by the difference between the concentration at the napl interface the aqueous solubility and the compound specific concentration of the surrounding water it can be determined by the following equation miller et al 1990 powers et al 1992 imhoff et al 1993 1 f k c c sat a nw where f is the interphase mass flux mg l 1 min 1 k is the intrinsic mass transfer coefficient cm min 1 c csat is the concentration difference between the dissolved organic liquid and the aqueous solubility mg l 1 koproch et al 2019 and anw is the specific interfacial area cm2 cm 3 which is the ratio between the interfacial area and the volume of the porous medium the interfacial area is difficult to measure especially at the field scale therefore mass transfer characteristics are often described as part of the lumped or bulk mass transfer coefficient powers et al 1992 to gain a fundamental understanding of the overall napl dissolution rate at the microscale several studies have been conducted to quantify the mass transfer characteristics cho et al 2005 grant and gerhard 2007 pan et al 2007 and napl mass removal rates noordman et al 2000 corapcioglu et al 2009 as a function of the interfacial area the total interfacial area is determined by the morphology of napl blobs the interfacial area is larger if an organic liquid is divided in small blobs and lays thinly spread inside the pore network than if napl exist as multi pore ganglia or pools saripalli 1997 however not all napl water surfaces are hydraulically connected to mobile water the effective interfacial area which includes all those surfaces involved in mass transfer is affected by the napl blob distribution inside the pore structure on a macro and microscale as a direct response to heterogenic napl distribution local preferential flow paths develop farthing et al 2012 and divide the napl source zones into regions of different discharge rates dissolution fingering on the microscale the total napl surface inside the pore network can be separated into different regions based on the dynamics of the water flow field corapcioglu et al 2009 and the position of the various napl blobs inside the pore network kennedy and lennox 1997 the most important regions affecting napl dissolution behavior are the napl surfaces exposed to mobile water these are the major contributors to napl mass removal as napl blobs in this region dissolve relatively fast in several dissolution experiments a sharp drop off in aqueous concentrations were observed mahal et al 2010 due to the shrinking of blobs in this region the portions of napl surface with less accessibility to flowing water which accounts for of up to 70 of the total napl volume in columns filled with homogenous glass beads johns and gladden 1999 were located in dead end pores or blocked by other napl blobs corapcioglu et al 2009 napl surfaces in contact with grains were not significantly involved in napl dissolution and therefore mass transfer from such regions is low based on the idea of different degrees of mobile water accessibility two blob classes have been defined and successfully applied with different mass transfer coefficients for the improvement of existing numerical models by reproducing those regions popp et al 2016 napl blobs can appear as single blobs or can be connected as multipore blobs or ganglia the development and distribution of which is strongly affected by napl saturation 27 thus anw is also a function of napl saturation and has been shown to increase at higher residual saturations saripalli 1997 cho and annable 2005 schnaar and brusseau 2006 local napl distribution and the ratio between wetting and non wetting fluid trapped inside the pore network is determined by the capillary pressure saturation relationship davis 1994 the capillary pressure pc can be calculated using the young laplace equation 2 p c 2 γ cosθ r where γ is the interfacial tension between two phases θ is the contact angle through the water phase and r is the radius of the capillary tube hence organic liquid water interfacial areas are the result of a complex interplay between porous media characteristics fluid parameters and the interaction between the fluids all of them in different quantities are sensitive to variations in temperature there have been no studies describing the effect of temperature on interfacial areas between organic liquids and the flowing water phase by direct measurements previous studies have focused on the influence of temperature on the bulk mass transfer coefficient imhoff et al 1997 illangasekare et al 2006 consisting of the intrinsic mass transfer coefficient and the effective interfacial area offering a more specific approach on mass transfer characteristics at elevated temperatures the main objective of this study was to investigate the temperature influence on the interfacial area between trichloroethylene tce and water using interfacial tracer tests ift to calculate anw the interfacial tension between the organic liquid and water is required so new data for temperature affected interfacial tension between tce and water was generated using the drop weight method lee et al 2009 2 material methods the ift is frequently used to determine the anw between water and an organic phase cho and annable 2005 saripalli 1997 kim et al 1997 setarge et al 1999 rao et al 2000 brusseau et al 2010 this technique is based on a monolayer adsorption of an anionic surfactant on the surface area of an organic liquid the equilibrium of adsorption between the aqueous tracer solution and the organic phase is described by the gibbs adsorption equation saripalli 1997 kim 1997 and is expressed by the adsorption coefficient ki cm which is a measure of how many molecules can adsorb per specific napl surface area as follows 3 k i 1 2 rt γ c t c c0 where c0 mol ml 1 is the tracer inflow concentration t k is the temperature r j mol k is the universal gas constant γ dyn cm 1 is the interfacial tension between the flushing solution and the napl and c mol ml 1 is the tracer concentration γ as a function of c which is needed for the calculation of the adsorption coefficient ki can be obtained using the drop weight method lee et al 2009 due to the adsorption of the surfactant on the organic liquid surface the reactive tracer solution retards relative to a conservative constituent retardation is described by the following equation saripalli 1997 4 r ift μ ift μ

is the interfacial area between the fluids per volume of porous media ρ is the porous media bulk density g cm 3 and ωw is the volumetric water content the latter term of eq 4 considers that adsorption of the anionic surfactant on the porous media matrix anw can then be calculated from rearranging eq 4 as follows 5 a nw r ift 1 ρ k s ω w ω w k i interfacial tracer tests were performed in vertical orientated stainless steel columns with a length of 15 cm and a diameter of 3 2 cm analytical grade tce merck kgaa darmstadt germany was used as a representative napl and technical grade sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate sdbs sigma aldrich co llc as a reactive or interfacial tracer an sdbs inflow concentration of 0 52 mm was chosen this is below the critical micelle concentration cmc of 1 6 mm at 20 c tahirat et al 2011 where molecules start to build up intermolecular connections for higher temperatures cmc increases sowada 1980 so no experimental difficulties were expected due to micelle bonding technical grade lithium bromide merck with a concentration of 40 mg l 1 0 5 mm was used as a non reactive tracer sdbs and bromide concentrations were analyzed by measuring electrical conductivity wtw cond 197i probe tetracon 325 as no other components contributed to electrical conductivity the tracer tests with sdbs and bromide were performed separately regression lines for sdbs and bromide calibration showed a good fit for both substances r2 of 0 99 fig 1 all measurements for calibrations and for samples were made at 20 c quartz sand schlingmeier schwülper germany with particle sizes between 0 2 mm and 0 8 mm was used as the porous medium according to the manufacturer the sand has a uniformity index of 62 and a specific surface area of 58 cm2 g 1 for every test performed the effective porosity was calculated using an 1d analytical solution of the transport equation for confined homogenous and isotropic boundary conditions the sand was sieved by a 0 1 mm mesh and washed by ultrapure deionized water 0 055 μs cm 1 di to remove adsorbed ions from the particle surfaces the sand was washed until the recharged water had an electrical conductivity of 5 μs cm 1 for a rapid development of a parallel flow field inside the column 1 cm of the column was filled with gravel 2 mm washed by ultrapure deionized water an externally prepared mixture of tce quartz sand and di was quickly poured into the column while stirring with a glass rod to mobilize possible air inclusions to adjust tce pore saturations to between 0 05 and 0 15 the volume of added tce ranged from 2 ml to 6 ml the ift experiments were performed at 10 c 30 c and 60 c table 1 in a refrigerator and a heating chamber respectively 60 c and 30 c represent typical temperatures which can be found around the hot area of utes used for heat exchange and the surrounding thermally affected areas the sdbs and bromide solution were pumped through the columns separately one after another by a peristaltic pump ismatec ecoline vc ms ca8 6 with a water flow rate of 1 6 ml min 1 which corresponds to a flow velocity of 10 m d 1 at the column outflow a pressure valve with 0 3 bar was adjusted to suppress gas phase development at higher temperatures all experiments were carried out by running the sdbs tracer test first and the bromide tracer second tracer tests were performed until the outflow concentration equaled the inflow concentration for several consecutive sampling times so that an adjustment of the adsorption equilibrium was assured afterwards the columns were rinsed again with di water weighted outflow fractions were used to calculate the overall flow volume in the run up to the series of tce consisting ifts two experiments with the same experimental setup as the ift itself were carried out without tce at two temperatures 20 c and 55 c to measure the background adsorption of sdbs onto porous medium and column assembly interfacial tension as a function of temperature and tracer concentration was measured by the drop weight method lee et al 2009 for 10 c 30 c and 60 c the tce phase 0 2 ml was injected into the aqueous sdbs solution by a gas tight glass syringe with a circular tube while injecting the number of tce drops formed during the injection was counted to calculate an average drop volume this value was used to calculate the interfacial tension using the formula described in lee et al 2009 aqueous sdbs solutions were prepared in concentrations ranging from 0 without sdbs mmol l 1 to 1 mmol l 1 the tce phase inside the gas tight glass syringe and sdbs solutions were heated or cooled to the desired temperature the drop weight method was performed in a refrigerator for measurements at 10 c and in a heating chamber for those at 30 c and 60 c a digital thermometer monitored temperatures of aqueous solutions with an accuracy of 0 1 c 3 results 3 1 interfacial tension and adsorption coefficient the interfacial tensions derived by the drop weight method were used to 1 to identify new data on the temperature effects on the interfacial tension between water and tce and 2 to calculate the adsorption coefficient ki which is necessary in eq 5 to determine anw the primary outcome of this study 1 the measurements made by the drop weight method showed linearly decreasing interfacial tensions between water and tce with temperature increases from 10 c to 30 c and 60 c fig 2 this observation mostly concurs with the measurements between perchloroethylene pce and water39 between 20 c and 80 c however the interfacial tension between tce and water in this study decreases roughly eight times faster than between pce and water40 γtce 45 88 0 34 t γpce 45 81 0 04 t the results also showed a slightly decreasing slope of the linear regressions when the sdbs concentration is increasing fig 2 2 the measured interfacial tension γ between tce and the aqueous solution decreased with increasing sdbs concentration c in a logarithmic manner for every investigated temperature fig 3a and can be described by γ α βln c this is comparable to observations made at 25 c cho and annable 2005 saripalli et al 1998 therefore the term δγ δc in eq 3 to calculate the adsorption coefficient ki can be described by the derivation of γ α βln c the ki value was then calculated by replacing δγ δc with β c 0 to 6 k i 1 2 rt β c 0 by using the β values 4 13 for 10 c 3 67 for 30 c and 2 51 for 60 c r2 between 0 95 and 0 97 of the logarithmic regression curve of the measured interfacial tension as a function of sdsb concentration the adsorption coefficient ki was observed to decrease with increasing temperatures table 1 fig 3b this indicates that less molecules of the surfactant can adsorb per specific napl surface area with increasing temperature similar observations were made for adsorption isotherms of dissolved tce on activated carbon erto et al 2009 the small variations in ki at one temperature see table 1 differences are too small to be obvious in fig 4b are due to small differences in influent tracer concentration fig 4 a interfacial tension γ as a function of sdbs concentration for 10 c 30 c and 60 c b adsorption coefficient ki as a function of temperature 3 2 tce water interfacial area as a function of tce saturation and temperature breakthrough curves from the tracer experiments without tce in the sediment showed less adsorption of sdbs on the sediment matrix compared to the experiments with tce in the sediment matrix with retardation of 1 060 at 20 c and 1 052 at 55 c respectively the effect of temperature on sdbs retardation caused by the sediment matrix is therefore comparatively small and the background retardation value was set to 1 06 which was subtracted from the result of every experiment it is to be expected that the background retardation during the further experiments was even lower due to a shielding of the sediment matrix by napl depending on napl saturation however this effect is small in relation to the retardation due to adsorption onto tce retardation became evident in breakthrough curves as tce was added to the column fig 5 increasing the temperature then had a considerable effect on retardation indicated by the breakthrough curves in fig 5 based on the measured sdbs retardation anw was calculated to be 40 cm2cm 3 at 10 c 67 cm2cm 3 at 30 c and 341 cm2cm 3 at 60 c at comparable tce saturations of close to 10 see table 1 on average the anw at 60 c for similar tce saturations were 220 cm2cm 3 320 cm2cm 3 larger than at 10 c a factor of six to eight however the effect of temperature on anw was significantly smaller between 10 c and 30 c where differences ranged between 6 cm2cm 3 and 51 cm2cm 3 table 1 fig 5 the same phenomenon was observed when the tce saturation was increased between lower 4 5 5 and higher 12 5 15 tce saturations the largest increase in anw of 74 cm2cm 3 from 280 cm2cm3 to 354 cm2cm 3 was observed at 60 c table 1 fig 5 whereas at 10 c and 30 c this increase was lower of approximately 35 cm2cm 3 and 50 cm2cm 3 respectively to functionally describe the measured results it was considered that the anw sn relation must go through zero a logarithmic regression curve to describe the relationship between anw and sn can be calculated by the following equation 7 a nw a ln s n b this was then fitted to the measured data for every temperature fig 6 this data is comparable to previous studies that measured anw as a function of napl saturation by a power law function of 0 66 cho et al 2005 saripalli 1997 to derive a single function that describes eq 7 for every temperature the a and b values from eq 7 were plotted against temperature from each logarithmic regression curve of the anw sn plot fig 6a both values increase exponentially with increasing temperatures the constants a and b in eq 7 were replaced by the temperature dependent exponential relationships obtained from fig 6a 8 a nw 4 47 e 0 039 t ln s n 18 68 e 0 04 t the function described in eq 8 accurately reproduces the measured anw at 10 c except at the point of tce pore saturation of 15 3 and has an overall r2 of 0 96 fig 6b at 30 c the function overestimates and at 60 c the function underestimates the measured anw values slightly however the function follows the trend of the measured anw relatively well and has an overall r2 of 0 77 and 0 73 respectively since the water accessibility to napl in the pore space decreases at higher napl saturations decreasing anw can be assumed for tce pore saturations higher than those investigated here so the validity of the derived function is limited to the investigated napl saturation 3 3 changes in effective porosity the effective porosity neff for the used sand was found to be 0 315 on average for experiments without tce table 1 in all experiments with integrated tce neff showed a declining trend with increasing tce pore saturation while the extend of this decline is at 2 13 near the anticipated range for 10 and 30 c due to pore space reduction by the added napl neff decrease for 60 c is at 11 38 much stronger especially at higher tce pore saturations table 1 fig 7 the presumed processes for this stronger neff decrease at 60 c are discussed in chapter 4 3 4 discussion in this study the effective interfacial area increased by a factor of eight between 10 c and 60 c in the following subsections possible implications on the napl water interfacial areas are discussed 4 1 temperature impact on organic liquid density and implications for napl blob geometry organic liquid densities decrease with increasing temperature yaws 2009 this leads to an increase in volume for napl blobs trapped in porous medium known as thermal swelling thermal swelling accounts for some of the increases measured in anw but the resulting volume increase of 7 between 10 c and 60 c leads to an increased surface area of just 5 for ideal spheres however even if a calculated increase in volume due to thermal swelling was just 7 single blobs in pore throats or ganglia could have been pressed or elongated into the next pore leading to the development of multipore blobs this reorganization could also contribute to larger surface areas cho and annable 2005 since multipore blobs have less sphericity and a larger specific interfacial area compared to singlet pore blobs zhang et al 2002 4 2 temperature impact on contact angle and wettability the effects of temperature on the contact angle are compound specific and depend on the solid phase wang and gupta 1995 for a crude oil brine quartz system wang and gupta found that the contact angle increased with temperature but decreased in a carbonate system hackett 2007 observed a decreasing contact angle for a pce water quartz system in micromodels while the contact angle increased for a tce water quartz system with increasing temperature in a study based on fitted capillary pressure saturation curves from silica filled columns the contact angle of pce was calculated to increase up to 40 between 20 c and 60 c she and sleep 1998 less spherical napl blobs and an increase in the napl wet surface fraction are followed by an increase in the contact angle changes in wettability resulted in a significantly different shaped curve for the anw of decane and water in interfacial tracer experiments during primary drainage jain et al 2003 in flow cell experiments the anw for residual hydrocarbons increased by approximately 44 as sand was napl wetted from 0 to 100 raoush 2009 increases in wettability due to higher temperatures directly influences napl geometry and blob distribution and consequently anw 4 3 temperature influences on interfacial tension and capillary pressure and implications for local napl distribution in this study the interfacial tension between tce and water decreased by 35 between 10 c and 60 c fig 2 this is consistent with previous research sleep and ma 1997 that measured a 58 reduction in the interfacial tension between water and voltesso 35 a representative lnapl between 20 c and 90 c based on the lower interfacial tension the capillary pressure was supposed to be significantly smaller at higher temperatures derived from capillary pressure saturation curves davis 1994 and she and sleep 1998 found that capillary pressure decreased by 50 to 66 in napl water quartz systems between 20 c and 80 c for a paraffinic oil and pce respectively therefore one significant pull force in the direction of pore throats was reduced at higher temperatures this also affects the curvature of the vaulted interface between an organic liquid and water in a capillary tube the degree of which is directly proportional to the capillary pressure niessner 2009 leharne 2019 consequently a decrease in capillary pressure as caused by increased temperatures allows napl blob retraction from hydraulically poor connected pore throats in the direction of hydraulically well connected pore centers this is thought to be the predominant mechanism of increasing anw during the interfacial tracer tests napl blob retraction could then open the hydraulic pathways initially blocked by tce blobs thereby improving contact of tce blobs to mobile water this would be in accordance with the study by popp et al 2016 that fit a numerical model to experimental derived dissolution rates by increasing anw and thus the portion of well connected napl to flowing water by about 22 for 40 c compared to 10 c the concept of temperature induced changes in the proportion of napl regions in contact to mobile water is also applicable to the capillary pressure saturation analysis made by davis 1994 and she and sleep 1998 who showed that a lower amount of residual organic non wetting phase will be retained in porous media at higher temperatures in particular the displacement of napl blobs from pore throats in direction of pore centers also correlates with the detected temperature induced reductions of neff at 60 c 4 4 napl mobilization an increase in temperature leads to a number of parameter changes which can also alter the potential of napl displacement of the residual phase this mainly affects the viscosity density surface tension capillary pressure maximum residual napl saturation contact angle and capillary number most of these changes tend to favor napl mobilization however chcs are not expected to mobilize with increasing temperature because water viscosity decreases more quickly than the interfacial tension for those substances with water sleep and ma 1997 a measure for residual napl mobilization is the total trapping number nt which can be simplified for vertical flow conditions as follows pennel et al 1996 9 n t n ca n b where nca is the capillary number eq 10 which relates viscosity to capillary forces and nb is the bond number eq 11 which represents the ratio of the buoyancy to capillary forces pennell et al 1996 aydin et al 2011 the critical value of nt required to initiate organic liquid mobilization is stated as 10 5 whereby higher values represent higher mobility nca and nb can be calculated by pennell et al 1996 aydin et al 2011 10 n ca q w μ w γ cos θ 11 n b ρgk k rw γ cos θ where qw is the darcy velocity of the aqueous phase cm s 1 μw is the dynamic viscosity of the aqueous phase dyn s cm 2 δρ is the density difference of the napl and the aqueous phase g is the gravitational acceleration k is the intrinsic permeability and krw is the relative permeability of the aqueous phase the values of nca and nb were calculated by using the measured interfacial tension fig 3a with viscosities taken from yaws 2009 and assuming θ 0 for 10 c medium is water wet and an increase in θ of 0 38 c as observed in micromodels for tce in water hackett 2007 k and krw were based on the experimental conditions set as 10 7 cm2 and 0 9 mean respectively taking into account that krw is sensitive to wetting conditions seyededabbasi et al 2008 which have been indicated to be variable with temperature krw may also be sensitive to temperature however it did not have a significant effect on these calculations in this experimental system the nt were 4 4 10 6 at 10 c 4 1 10 6 at 40 c and 3 6 10 6 at 60 c respectively these values are comparable to other reported trapping numbers of the order of 10 6 for residual toluene aydin et al 2011 based on these calculations mobilization of the residual tce phase could not be expected to occur only because of elevated temperatures because the calculated nt are all two orders of magnitude below the critical value for mobilization even at high temperatures this concurs with calculations from sleep and ma sleep and ma 1997 that showed similar nca values between 20 c and 90 c for pce at a darcy velocity of 1 m d 1 in conclusion increasing the temperature in the interfacial tracer tests results in significantly higher anw but did not lead to down or upwards mobilization of the residual tce phase however solvent mixtures are frequently present at some chc sites and their ift depends on the specific composition seo and mccray 2002 therefore and as a next step the temperature induced mobilization potential for napl mixtures should be evaluated experimentally and theoretically on the basis of single component characteristics 5 conclusions napl mass flow in soil and groundwater is subject to a complex interaction between various processes and parameters most of these are affected by temperature increases as well as the effective interfacial area anw which increases with temperature in this study increases between 10 c and 30 c were comparatively small in the order of 16 to 50 whereas between 10 c and 60 c anw increased by a factor of eight based on several tracer experiments a temperature variable function to estimate the interfacial area of tce was developed eq 8 using tce saturations between 5 and 15 well sorted sand and temperatures of 10 c 30 c and 60 c although the validity of the relationships represented here is limited to the boundary conditions and the sediment used these results demonstrate the significant impact of elevated temperatures at the interface between grains the organic and water phase and their local distribution to each other further investigations should evaluate how strong the temperature effect on anw depends on sediment specific and temperature dependent parameters like capillary pressure wettability and contact angle increasing the temperature especially to temperatures of 60 c and probably higher leads to significantly improved hydraulic contact between a napl and the flowing water phase napl migrates on a pore scale from dead end pores and pore throats towards pore centers the predominant mechanism behind this are suggested to be thermally induced changes in wettability and blob shape following the concept of two blob classes popp et al 2016 the proportion of fast dissolving blobs increases with increasing temperature as a result of both processes longer contact time due to increased contact area between the napl and the flowing water contributes to accelerated dissolution and an increasing mass transfer rate into the aqueous phase therefore the application of utes to contaminated sites and increasing temperatures could reduce the lifetime of long term contaminants additionally the effect of increased mass transfer due to increased anw at higher temperatures also enhances thermal remediation approaches or other techniques like pump treat air stripping or chemical methods compared to the strong increases in anw the thermally induced decreases in neff are small but should also be considered for groundwater flow on a larger scale however if the total effective surface area is large enough that contact time is sufficient to reach equilibrium dissolution may be limited by solubility the decreasing tce solubility between 10 c and 40 c koproch et al 2019 could mean that even if the dissolution rate increases by increasing temperature mass transfer can decrease due to limited solubility whether aqueous contaminant concentrations increase or decrease depends on the respective predominant process which in turn is dependent on site specific prevailing sediments and napl distribution due to the hydraulic heterogeneity of natural aquifers enhanced kinetic dissolution because of increased anw and equilibrium dissolution are assumed to take place in parallel further studies for heterogeneous systems are required to understand these interactions utes in urban areas could play an important role in the transition of energy supplies from fossil fuels to renewable sources in particular contaminated aquifers offer storage space that is frequently available and excluded from drinking water production as a result they could serve as energy storage reservoirs providing a new and important function in climate and resource protection and revitalization existing thermal remediation approaches heron et al 2006 operate at temperatures between 70 c and 120 c and the effectiveness of other remediation strategies such as enhanced natural attenuation ni et al 2016 kosegi et al 2000 and in situ chemical oxidation johnson et al 2011 is potentially enhanced at elevated temperatures this illustrates the potential for combining utes and groundwater remediation nevertheless there is a risk of increased mass flow from the source zone to deal with such risks the technological and administrative methodologies have to be adapted detailed knowledge about napl mass flows at elevated temperatures and the derived constitutive relations as developed here for anw can help predict manage and remediate the effects of geothermal installations or utes applications in contaminated urban areas to increase the reliability of predictive models to such an extent that applications meet official requirements and to build confidence among companies and authorities further field studies are

1341,in this study a fully coupled analytical model is developed for thermal energy transfer in a single fracture rock matrix system where the coupling implies that the governing equations of thermal transfer in the fracture and rock matrix are supplemented with the continuity conditions of temperature and thermal flux at the interfaces of the fracture rock matrix the proposed model accounts for thermal convection longitudinal thermal conduction and thermal dispersion in the fracture and transverse thermal conduction in the rock matrix the fully coupled two dimensional model is established to investigate the thermal energy transfer processes assess the spatiotemporal temperature distribution in the fracture and rock matrix system and investigate the role of the rock matrix the solutions are verified with the existing studies and proven to be accurate and robust the present study demonstrates that 1 thermal dispersion in the fracture plays an important role in the temperature distribution in the fracture and rock matrix domains and longitudinal thermal conduction in the fracture has minor effects on the temperature distribution in the system 2 transverse thermal conduction in the rock matrix is a critical parameter that determines the spatiotemporal temperature distribution in both the fracture and the rock matrix domains ignoring thermal conduction in the rock matrix will lead to a significant overestimation of temperature in the short and long terms 3 the sensitivity analysis implies that thermal energy transfer in the system is sensitive to the fluid velocity in the fracture thermal dispersivity in the fracture and thermal conductivity in the rock matrix and less sensitive to thermal conductivity in the fracture keywords thermal transfer reactive transport

fracture network is integrated by the rather simple intersected discrete fractures and the surrounding rock matrix it is critical to understand the transport processes of mass and heat transfer in the

kolditz 1995 luo et al 2016 rutqvist et al 2002 despite the apparent simplifications the estimation about heat distribution in discrete fracture networks and the analysis of heat transfer behaviors in the fractured porous routinely rely on analytical and semi analytical models for example in the single fracture rock matrix system numerical models might be severely affected by the non negligible numerical errors and meshing challenges because of the extreme narrow fracture aperture and the sharp property transition across the fracture and rock matrix interface grisak and pickens 1981 zhou et al 2018 the analytical models can provide robust assessments under such scenarios and are irreplaceable for benchmarking the numerical models van genuchten et al 2013 zhou et al 2017 thermal transfer in the fractured porous media mainly occurs in the fracture fluid and the tight rock matrix with low permeability as their apparent differences heat transfer in the fracture is governed by thermal convection dispersion and conduction while heat transfer in the rock matrix is approximated by thermal conduction several classical solutions for convective thermal transfer in the fractured geothermal reservoir and the aquifer aquitard system induced by the injection were proposed by bödvarsson and tsang 1982 and chen and reddell 1983 to assess the long term temperature distribution and the estimation of aquifer thermal properties yang et al 1998 studied the irregularly interconnected discrete fractures and estimated the temperature distribution and hydrothermal circulation in the discretely fractured porous media through special adaption of a new finite element numerical algorithm they concluded that the discrete fractures could induce and maintain hydrothermal fluid circulation in the porous media and thus significantly change an established convection pattern in their appendix an analytical solution for heat transfer in discrete fractures accounting for thermal convection and conduction in the fracture rock matrix system was also presented to validate their newly proposed numerical model the detailed distinction between the mathematical solutions of yang et al 1998 and the present study can be found in the section of discussion chevalier and banton 1999a 1999b studied heat transfer in confined aquifers and fractured aquifers with pumping or injection wells by the random walk method the stochastic method can be particularly useful on the highly heterogenous media and fractured aquifers cheng et al 2001 ghassemi et al 2003 and ghassemi et al 2005 provided models for two dimensional and three dimensional heat conduction in a single fracture induced by wells with green s function methods and numerical methods and observed that higher temperatures from the multidimensional methods compared to the one dimensional method the temperature increase was more significant near the injection well and in the long term martinez et al 2014 presented a two dimensional analytical model considering longitudinal and transverse thermal energy conduction and convection in a single fracture with a two way coupling between heat transfer in fracture and the surrounding infinite matrix a fracture matrix peclet number was defined to analyze the efficiency of geothermal systems their solutions were served as a useful tool for benchmarking numerical studies parametric sensitivity analysis geothermal reservoir evaluation and management however the influence of thermal dispersion in the fracture was ignored in the studies above because of the dominant role of advective fluid flow in the fracture one should note that the mathematical solutions developed for mass transport in the porous media are amenable to heat transfer problems because of the mathematical and physical analogy wang et al 2020a however the relative importance of different transport mechanisms can be vastly different in solute transport and heat transfer for instance molecular diffusion may be too small to consider in most solute transport problems if the groundwater is not completely motionless but thermal conduction which is analogous to diffusion for solute transport can be a very effective and sometimes the dominant mechanism for transferring thermal energy another fact is that solid matrix is very efficient for conducting heat but they are impermeable for conducting solute because of such differences there are still considerable debates on the role of thermal dispersion some investigators argue that thermal dispersion is insignificant because of the strong conductive heat transfer bear 1972 cheng et al 2001 ingebritsen et al 2006 while other investigators argue that thermal dispersion is very important and must be considered for any field projects de ghislain 1986 hopmans et al 2002 rau et al 2012 smith and chapman 1983 even for the investigators who agreed that thermal dispersion should be considered there are still considerable debate on whether the thermal dispersivity is the same or not as the solute dispersivity for instance sauty et al 1982 argued that the magnitude of thermal dispersivity should be the same or very similar to the magnitude of solute dispersivity other investigators such as hufschmied 1985 constantz et al 2003 and vandenbohede et al 2009 argued that the magnitude of thermal dispersivity should be less than the magnitude of the solute dispersivity the previous studies indicated that the influence of thermal dispersion is proportional to the flow velocity lin et al 2019 pedras and de lemos 2008 rau et al 2012 zhou et al 2019 and included the velocity dependent thermal dispersion into their models for heat transfer in the fractures and aquifer thermal energy storage ates the objectives of this study are to develop an analytical model for describing the transient thermal energy distribution in the discrete fractures assess the relative importance of each individual thermal transfer processes and investigate the role of rock matrix in controlling heat transfer in the fracture rock matrix system thermal convection longitudinal thermal conduction and thermal dispersion in the fracture and transverse thermal conduction in the rock matrix are accounted for in the model the thermal energy transfer in the fracture and rock matrix is fully coupled where the coupling implies that the governing equations of thermal transfer in the fracture and rock matrix are connected with two continuity conditions temperature and thermal flux are continuous at the interfaces of the fracture rock matrix heat transfer in the rock matrix is governed by transverse thermal conduction as an important thermal transfer mechanism the thermal dispersive transfer is usually considered in the solute transport problem but often ignored when dealing with heat transfer issues in this study the influence of thermal dispersion and thermal conduction in the fracture are incorporated simultaneously to characterize the temperature distribution in such a fully coupled two dimensional fracture rock matrix system 2 conceptual model and physical setup the conceptual scheme is presented in fig 1 a single fracture is situated horizontally and confined by the homogeneous rock matrix the orientation of the single fracture can be in any direction as gravity is not a concern here so the presentation of a horizontally sited single fracture in fig 1 is merely for the sake of illustration the fracture is thin with a constant aperture of 2b and extends sufficiently far from the domain of interest the rock matrix is wide and outspreads far vertically from the fracture which implies that the influence of the matrix outer boundaries is ignored the overlying and underlying rock matrices have identical hydrological and thermal properties and are symmetrically distributed with respect to the middle plane of the fracture accordingly a cartesian coordinate system is defined to characterize the transfer processes under the groundwater background flow from left to right through the fracture at a constant rate following the groundwater flow direction the x axis is orientated horizontally from left to right along the middle plane of the fracture the z axis is located vertically upward along the left inlet boundary of the system and perpendicular to the x axis the y axis is horizontally oriented and perpendicular to the x z plane the origin is located at the intersection of the x y and z axes which is also the junction of the left system boundary and the middle plane of the fracture the heat source is located at x 0 with a constant temperature t 0 and extends infinite far from the origin along the y axis thus the model can be simplified and reduced to a two dimensional model in x z plane without accounting for the y axis furthermore due to the symmetric distribution of the rock matrix properties and geometries regarding the x axis the overlying rock matrix has the identical thermal energy distribution and heat transfer behaviors to the underlying rock matrix thus the fracture rock matrix model only needs to consider the upper half plane associated with the thermal energy transfer processes considered in this model the following assumptions are made regarding the properties and geometries of the fracture and rock matrix 1 the rock matrix is composed of tight materials and several orders of magnitude less permeable than the fracture the apparent differences in transport properties justify that the groundwater flow is mainly limited to the open fracture and thermal convection in the rock matrix is ignored in the present model 2 at t 0 the fracture rock matrix has an initial temperature which is a constant t i across the entire system the heat source is located at x 0 with a constant temperature t o 3 when temperature is not changed dramatically and significantly it is feasible and reasonable to assume that the thermal and physical properties of the fluid and solid materials are not temperature dependent stopa and wojnarowski 2006 4 the interfaces between fracture and rock matrix are smooth and parallel to each other the groundwater flow within the fracture is laminar and impressible therefore the influence of gravity and fracture roughness can be negligible 5 the fracture is rather thin and hence the transverse thermal conduction in the fracture can be ignored bödvarsson and tsang 1982 6 the thermal flux in the rock matrix is primarily caused by the temperature gradient between the fracture and rock matrix along the transverse direction thus longitudinal thermal conduction in the rock matrix is neglectable and thermal energy transfer in the rock matrix can be approximated by transverse thermal conduction only li et al 2010 7 although the fracture sediment infilling is observed in some experimental and theoretical studies wealthall et al 2001 zhou et al 2017 the fracture is much more porous and permeable than the surrounding rock matrix the sediment infilling and pore water in the fracture are considered as one homogeneous continuum based on the assumption that it is instantaneous for the sediment infilling and pore water in the fracture to reach local thermal equilibrium the one domain approach is adopted to describe the thermal energy transfer processes in the fracture 3 mathematical modeling the thermal energy transfer processes in the fracture rock matrix see fig 1 are coupled and governed by the following partial differential equations pdes in the fracture and rock matrix complying with fourier s law since the thermal parameters are not temperature dependent in this study the governing equations for heat transfer are analogous to solute transport problems

of the fracture and rock matrix kg m 3 respectively c f and c m are specific heat of the fracture and rock matrix j kg 1 c 1 respectively it is worthwhile to point out that the product of ρ and c is usually referred to as volumetric thermal capacity j m 3 c 1 which can be determined based on the properties of the porous media and the liquid ρ m c m 1 ϕ m ρ s c s ϕ m ρ w c w where ρ s and ρ w are the densities of the solid grains and water in the rock matrix kg m 3 respectively c s and c w are specific heat of the solid grains and water in the rock matrix j kg 1 c 1 respectively ϕ m is the porosity of the rock matrix 2b is the aperture of the fracture m q is thermal conductive flux across the wall between the facture and the rock matrix w m 2 k m is the average transverse thermal conductivity of the rock matrix w m 1 c 1 which can be evaluated by k m 1 ϕ m k s ϕ m k w where k s and k w are thermal conductivities of the solid and water in the rock matrix respectively the value of k m is dependent on the moisture content k f is effective thermal conductivity of the fracture w m 1 c 1 note that effective thermal conduction in the fracture consists of thermal dispersion and thermal conduction therefore as a homogeneous continuum effective thermal conductivity k f in the fracture is composed of two critical components k f k l k d where k l is longitudinal thermal conductivity w m 1 c 1 and k d is thermal dispersion coefficient w m 1 c 1 according to the previous studies rau et al 2012 stauffer et al 2013 zhou et al 2019 the thermal dispersion coefficient k d can be estimated as the product of thermal dispersivity fluid thermal capacity porosity and flow velocity k d ϕ f ρ w c w βv where β is thermal dispersivity m a high flow velocity will increase the value of thermal dispersion in such a fully coupled fracture rock matrix system thermal energy is transferred into the rock matrix from the fracture because of thermal conduction the thermal conductive flux across the fracture rock matrix interface can be expressed as the following equation 3 q k m t mat z z b temperature is assumed to be continuous across the interface between the fracture and rock matrix z b which means that the fracture temperature is the same as the temperature of the rock matrix at the fracture rock matrix interface 4 t mat x z b t t fra x t initially the fracture rock matrix system has a constant temperature t i the heat source with constant temperature t 0 is located at x 0 the first type boundary is employed to describe the boundary condition here the fracture and rock matrix are sufficiently far the rock matrix extends infinitely wide from the domain of interest therefore the influence of the outer boundaries can be ignored the fracture and rock matrix are subject to the following initial and boundary conditions 5 t fra x t 0 t i t fra x 0 t t 0 t fra x t t i 6 t mat x z t 0 t i t mat x z t t i to normalize the fracture rock matrix temperature and simplify the notations the following dimensionless parameters are defined t f t fra t i t 0 t i t m t mat t i t 0 t i where t f and t m denote the normalized temperatures dimensionless

the original pdes are converted to ordinary differential equations odes considering the boundary conditions of the fracture and rock matrix one can solve the odes and achieve the analytical solutions

1982 the de hoog inverse laplace transform algorithm has been extensively used in solving mass and heat transfer problems and provides successful inverse laplace transfer calculations wang et al 2020b wang and zhan 2015 in this study it is implemented with a matlab script the solutions are then used to compare with the previous study for the verification purpose analyze the spatiotemporal temperature distribution in the fracture rock matrix system and estimate the relative importance of some hydrological and thermal properties on the temperature distribution and evolution 4 results and discussion 4 1 comparison with the previous solutions examples and case studies are used to present the newly derived semi analytical solutions and analyze the spatiotemporal temperature distribution in the fracture rock matrix system unless specified otherwise the following values of thermal and hydraulic properties are adopted in this section from previous studies martinez et al 2014 yang et al

matrix system is 30 c one should note that the heat source located at the left boundary t o can be either warmer or cooler than system initial temperature t i in this study the heat source t o is at a higher temperature of 50 c hot water flows in the fracture at a constant velocity v of 1 6 10 4 m s the fracture has a porosity ϕ f of 95 and a full aperture 2b of 1 10 3m the influence of thermal dispersion coefficient k d in the fracture is velocity dependent and defined as k d ϕ f ρ w c w βv the values of thermal dispersivity β are usually obtained from the regression and statistical analysis between the field observations and mathematical simulations xu and eckstein 1995 to better illustrate the model results and investigate the thermal energy transfer processes without losing generality two points of interest are selected rather arbitrarily in the fracture and rock matrix p1 0 5 m 0 m at the middle plane of the fracture and p2 0 5 m 0 5 m in the rock matrix respectively as the symmetric distribution of the hydrologic and thermal properties regarding x 0 the spatiotemporal thermal distribution in the lower half plane is identical to that in the upper half plane therefore p2 0 5 m 0 5 m is used to represent the thermal distribution in both overlying and underlying rock matrices the advection time tv x is a dimensionless parameter that has been widely adopted in the studies of solute transport and heat transfer to present and analyze the results martinez et al 2014 zhou et al 2017 the advective flow front reaches the point of interest in fracture when it is about 1 yang et al 1998 and martinez et al 2014 respectively developed one and two dimensional models for heat transfer in the similar geological settings composed of the discrete fractures and rock matrix as distinct from yang s one dimensional mathematical solution yang et al 1998 considering thermal conduction and convection in the open fracture the present study accounts for the solid sediments filled in discrete fractures which typically slows down the fluid velocity and affects thermal convection and conduction in the fractures acknowledging the existence of the sediment infilling commonly observed in the facture wealthall et al 2001 the model for heat transfer in the fracture rock matrix system derived in this study can be used to not only analyze heat transfer in the filled fracture rock matrix system but also interpret the thermal energy distribution in other geological settings such as heat transfer in the unconformities and aquifer aquitard system as discussed extensively lin et al 2019 zhou et al 2019 the influence of thermal dispersivity is related to fluid velocity also yang s solution yang et al 1998 assumed that thermal dispersivity is a constant and independent from all other parameters which may fail to characterize the relative importance of thermal dispersity and assess the heat distribution lin et al 2019 zhou et al 2019 in this study the influence of thermal dispersivity is estimated as fluid velocity dependent the present solutions of temperature distribution in the fracture and rock matrix can be easily migrated to simulate heat transfer under radial flow induced by wells with variable velocities over radial distance to verify the model the newly derived solutions are compared with the analytical solutions developed by yang et al 1998 and martinez et al 2014 by assuming the fracture is fully open with liquid component only ϕ f 100 and ignoring velocity dependent thermal dispersivity in the fracture β 0 the model developed in this study is similar to the solutions proposed by yang et al 1998 and martinez et al 2014 when longitudinal thermal conduction in the rock matrix is ignored as one can see the thermal breakthrough curves in fig 2 the normalized temperature at p1 0 5 m 0 m from this study solid lines reaches an excellent agreement with the normalized temperature solved by the previous studies dots and crosses with various fracture apertures which proves the robustness and accuracy of the newly proposed solutions 4 2 thermal breakthrough curve analysis as exhibited in fig 2 the normalized thermal breakthrough curves btcs at p1 0 5 m 0 m in the fracture t f are plotted against advective time with various fracture apertures with wider fracture apertures more thermal energy is transferred into the system from the heat source through the fracture thus higher temperature is observed in the fracture with one homogeneous continuum assumption the thermal energy is transferred by thermal convective thermal conductive and thermal dispersive transfer processes in the fracture the relative effects of thermal conduction and thermal dispersion on the thermal breakthrough curves of the fracture and rock matrix are depicted in the following figures when the values of thermal conductivity range from 0 w m 1 c 1 to 0 615 w m 1 c 1 thermal conduction in the fracture has almost no influence on heat transfer in the system from 0 615 w m 1 c 1 to 6 15 w m 1 c 1 a higher thermal conductivity leads to a slightly faster thermal transfer rate in the fracture according to the data measured and compiled by čermák and rybach 1982 a common range of thermal conductivity of different minerals and rocks is 0 4 7 0 w m 1 c 1 in general unconsolidated sedimentary rocks with little water content such as dry gravel and sandstone have low thermal conductivity values higher thermal conductivity values are found to be associated with most igneous metamorphic and sedimentary rocks especially for felsic igneous rocks rocks with high quartz elements and water components labus and labus 2018 most liquids have thermal conductivities less than 2 w m 1 c 1 vargaftik et al 2020 as one of the most common liquids observed in the fractures and aquifers water has thermal conductivity of 0 58 w m 1 c 1 carvill 1994 adopting reasonable values of fracture thermal conductivity one can conclude that thermal conduction has a minor influence on heat transfer in the fracture rock matrix system being part of effective thermal conduction in the fracture the influence of thermal dispersion on the temperature distribution in the fracture and rock matrix is presented in fig 4 thermal energy is transferred faster in the fracture and rock matrix when the value of thermal dispersity in the fracture is greater because of the lack of direct laboratory and field scale measurements on the values of thermal dispersivity in the fracture the values adopted in this study are based on assumptions and previous theoretical investigations anderson 2005 bou jaoude et al 2018 lin et al 2019 bou jaoude et al 2018 assumed a direct relationship between mass transport dispersivity and thermal dispersivity and considered that the fracture thermal dispersivity was ranged from 0 1 m to 3 m lin et al 2019 adopted the values of thermal dispersivity ranging from 0 m to 5 m to be representative without losing generality the values of thermal dispersivity in the fracture are assumed to range from 0 m to 5 m in fig 4 thermal breakthrough curves at points of interest are plotted with various thermal dispersivities in the fracture starting from 0 001 m with a ten fold increase until the upper limit when thermal dispersivity in the fracture is one or several orders of magnitude smaller than 0 01 m its influence on the temperature distribution in the fracture and rock matrix is minor compared to the case without thermal dispersivity therefore thermal dispersion in the fracture can be ignored without causing significant errors when thermal dispersivity in the fracture is greater than 0 01 m its influence on the temperature distribution in the system becomes more important and should not be ignored similar results about the temperature distribution over distance are depicted in fig 5 when thermal dispersivity has a very small value its influence on the temperature distribution in the fracture and rock matrix is minor the role of thermal dispersivity becomes more important at greater values thermal energy propagates further away from the origin in the fracture and extends deeper in the rock matrix when the value of thermal dispersivity is greater although the rock matrix is less permeable and porous heat is transferred from the fracture into the rock matrix by thermal conduction depicted by fig 6 with higher thermal conductivity in the rock matrix k m more thermal energy is transferred into the rock matrix from the fracture which leads to the lower temperature observed in the fracture 5 sensitivity analysis 5 1 local sensitivity analysis the normalized sensitivity method has been widely used in the studies of parameters analysis and uncertainties in mass transport in the fractures and aquifers huang and yeh 2007 kabala 2001 zhou et al 2017 it evaluates the relative influence of the input parameters on the output results by assuming a small positive increment on the input parameters which can be expressed mathematically by 13 k i j x j r i x j where x j is the j th input parameter of x r i is the output result which is the function of x j and other parameters k i j is the normalized sensitivity coefficient regarding the input parameter x j if the partial differential equation r i x j is approximated by a forward differencing algorithm eq 16 can be estimated by 14 k i j x j r i x j x j r i x j δ x j r i x j δ x j where δx j is a small positive increment of the input parameter x in many previous studies the value of δx j is set to 1 of x j δx j 0 01 x j substituting it into eq 17 one can estimate the value of normalized sensitivity coefficient as k i j 100 r i x j δx j r i x j it is found that the calculated normalized sensitivity coefficient is dependent on its relative importance and the values of the input parameter x j due to the lack of direct measurements of thermal dispersivity in the fracture from laboratory and field investigations its normalized sensitivity coefficient is plotted individually at various dispersivity values in fig 7 the temperature distribution in the fracture and rock matrix reveals that the relative influence of thermal dispersivity increases first and then decreases after its peak value the normalized sensitivity coefficient in the fracture reaches its peak value earlier than that in the rock matrix and it indicates that temperature in the fracture is more sensitive to thermal dispersion than that in the rock matrix when thermal dispersivity values are greater it becomes more influential but still less important compared to velocity which is consistent with the analysis in section 4 2 the values of longitudinal thermal conductivity in the fracture transverse thermal conductivity in the rock matrix and groundwater flow velocity in the fracture are well studied and measured their normalized sensitivity coefficients are plotted and compared in fig 8 the groundwater flow velocity in the facture has the greatest influence on the temperature in the fracture and rock matrix system among all three parameters the main reason is that the fracture is open and highly porous and the flow field in such system is dominated by the water flow in the fracture comparing the relative impact of fracture longitudinal thermal conductivity and transverse thermal conductivity in the rock matrix it is worthwhile to note that the thermal conductivity of the rock matrix is more influential than that of the fracture the thermal energy in the system is the least sensitive to longitudinal thermal conduction in the fracture among the three parameters mentioned it is recommended that the greatest efforts should be put on the determination of the flow field in the fracture and the thermal properties in the rock matrix due to their relative importance and sensitivity the system is less sensitive to thermal conduction in the fracture when thermal transfer is dominated by thermal convection 5 2 global sensitivity analysis although the local sensitivity analysis is easy to conduct and provides straightforward results its main drawback is also obvious it provides sensitivity analysis only at the local values where they are adopted for computation and does not consider the rest of the variation range of the model s input parameters it works fine when the values of input parameters are well measured however when the values of the input parameter have wide variation ranges such as thermal dispersivity in this study the local sensitivity analysis may fail to provide a consistent sensitivity estimation at all values campolongo and saltelli 1997 hamby 1994 for instance as shown in fig 7 different thermal dispersivity values in the fracture lead to distinct normalized sensitivity coefficients to better evaluate the influence of the input parameters on the output results and the interactions between the input parameters in their practical ranges several global sensitivity analysis techniques have been successfully employed in hydrological models like the screening method regression analysis variance based meta modeling method and others song et al 2015 tian 2013 in this study we adopt the morris method morris 1991 for the global sensitivity analysis of the thermal properties as one of the most common screening methods the morris method morris 1991 is a one step at a time sensitivity analysis design and provides an efficient and reliable approach to identify and rank important variables king and perera 2013 morris 1991 it includes following steps to assess the global sensitivity of each input parameter first the input parameter will be sampled in its possible range over a certain sampling points 0 1 q 1 2 q 1 3 q 1 q 2 q 1 1 where q is the number of samples within the range of each input parameter in this study a sample size is chosen to be 100 q 100 as discussed in section 4 the practical values of thermal dispersivity thermal conductivity in the fracture and thermal conductivity in the rock matrix are set to be 0 m 5 m 0 01 w m 1 c 1 2 w m 1 c 1 and 0 4 w m 1 c 1 7 w m 1 c 1 respectively second for a model with k variables one needs to construct a k 1 k sampling matrix b k 1 k with elements of 0 and 1 as b k 1 k 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 each column is changed one step at a time by a perturbed interval it can be written as the following matrix in terms of the input parameters p k 1 k p 1 p 2 p 3 p k p 1 δ p 1 p 2 p 3 p k p 1 δ p 1 p 2 δ p 2 p 3 p k p 1 δ p 1 p 2 δ p 2 p 3 δ p 3 p k p 1 δ p 1 p 2 δ p 2 p 3 δ p 3 p k δ p k in which δ refers to a small increment defined previously as 1 q 1 lastly for each input parameter p i the elementary effect ee i is evaluated as 15 e e i y p 1 p 2 p i δ p i p i 1 p k y p 1 p 2 p i p i 1 p k δ where y is the output result morris 1991 proposed two measures to assess the sensitivity mean μ i and standard deviation σ i the value of mean μ i is a measure of the overall influence by the input parameters on output results a greater μ i for a given parameter indicates that the parameter has a higher overall influence on the output results conversely a parameter with a μ i value that is closer to zero in contrast to other parameters implies a low sensitivity the standard deviation σ i is a measure to assess the possible interactions of the input variables with others in statistics interaction effect refers to the simultaneous effects of two or more independent variables on the output since the impact of one independent input parameter on the output results is not the same for all levels of other independent parameters interaction occurs when the influence of one independent parameter alters depending on another independent parameters pacheco torgal et al 2018 in other words it illustrates how two or more independent variables work together to impact the output results if the parameter has a larger σ i it indicates that the parameter has greater interactions with other input variables campolongo and braddock 1999 king and perera 2013 lin et al 2019 morris 1991 the two measures are defined as 16 μ i n 1 r e e n r 17 σ i 1 r n 1 r e e n μ i 2 where r is total sampling number and chosen to be 100 in this study the values of μ i and σ i are calculated with the help of a matlab toolbox pianosi et al 2015 in fig 9 we plot the global sensitivity analysis curves observed at x 0 5 m in the fracture for thermal dispersivity in the fracture β thermal conductivity in the fracture k l and thermal conductivity in the rock matrix k m based on mean left and standard deviation right the ees mean curves reveal that the temperature in the fracture is sensitive to β and k m and insensitive to k l meanwhile the ees standard deviation curves suggest that β has strong interactions with other parameters followed by k m a strong interaction implies that the effects of other variables such as k m and k l in the present study on the output results significantly depend on the state of β the interaction effects between k l and other variable are very weak compared to others the results in the standard deviation curves are consistent with those in the mean curves both measures indicate that heat transfer in the single fracture rock matrix system is very sensitive to thermal dispersivity in the fracture followed by thermal conductivity in the rock matrix the thermal property of the rock matrix plays a key role in heat transfer in the fracture rock matrix system which should not be ignored the temperature is insensitive to thermal conductivity in the fracture in summary the local and global sensitivity analysis about flow velocity and thermal conduction are consistent with the findings from the previous studies bou jaoude et al 2018 martinez et al 2014 the fluid velocity in the fracture is a critical parameter that governs the thermal energy transfer behaviors in discrete fractures thermal conductivity in the rock matrix and thermal dispersivity in the fracture play important roles in characterizing the temperature distribution in the fracture rock matrix system the results about thermal dispersivity are consistent with the observations from rau et al 2012 and metzger et al 2004 longitudinal thermal conduction in the fracture has the least effect on the heat distribution in the fracture rock matrix system ignoring the existence of longitudinal thermal conductive transport in the fracture may not cause significant error in such settings 6 limitations of the work this study provides important and innovative contributions that help us gain insights into thermal transport in a fracture matrix system however we should also be aware of the limitations of the study which will be briefly outlined as follows firstly the geometry of the fracture is simple for the sake of analytical treatment thus variation of fracture aperture and fracture wall roughness are not considered which both can affect the spatiotemporal distribution of the temperature if variable fracture aperture and fracture wall roughness can be known for instance in the laboratory experiments using x ray or scanning techniques rong et al 2020 tan et al 2020 then one may be able to use numerical modeling to investigate thermal transfer in a fracture rock system however one should bear in mind that detailed in situ fracture aperture variation and fracture wall roughness are rarely known in real field applications thus the simple fracture geometry becomes a practical approximation to deal with the problem one should be cautious that the analytical modeling based on the simple fracture geometry is mostly used to gain the understanding about the thermal transport processes in a fracture rock matrix system but it cannot be used directly for engineering design of field projects when fracture apertures vary considerably and or fracture wall roughness becomes a major concern of flow and transport furthermore the analytical modeling here can be used as a reference to benchmark complicated numerical modeling which may suffer from considerable numerical errors and or sometimes fail to converge when the media flow and transport properties change dramatically over sharp boundaries such as the fracture rock matrix interfaces also this study cannot be directly used for fracture networks involving many different fractures with all sorts of orientations apertures and roughness secondly the rock matrix is assumed to be identical above and below the fracture if the two rock matrix components above and below the fracture have different media properties which is a case specifically investigated by zhu and zhan 2018 one has to deal with the full plane instead of the half plane as done in this study the extension from a half plane conceptual model to a full plane conceptual model is possible following a similar approach used by zhu and zhan 2018 but will not be shown there as it is out of the main focus of this study thirdly we assume two thermal continuity conditions among different domains in this study temperature and thermal flux are continuous at the interfaces of the fracture rock matrix the thermal discontinuity due to nanoscale interfacial effects and possible complexity at the interface are not considered in this study bai et al 2018 balasubramanian and puri 2011 the investigation of thermal discontinuity may be conducted with modified boundary conditions in the future fourthly since the fracture is rather thin transverse thermal conduction and convection along z axis in the fracture are ignore and only heat transfer processes along the x axis are accounted for also as the thermal flux in the rock matrix is primarily caused by the temperature gradient along the direction of the z axis it is assumed that thermal transfer in the rock matrix is merely governed by transverse thermal conduction along the z axis li et al 2010 thus the two dimensional model proposed in this study is governed by two heat transfer equations with one way transfer processes in the fracture and rock matrix respectively in the convection dominated regimes such as highly porous aquifers and fractures the forementioned assumptions work well without producing unacceptable errors in the short term assessment cheng et al 2001 a one dimensional model with lower computational cost is appropriate to use with reasonable accuracy rezaei et al 2013 roubinet et al 2012 however the existence of longitudinal thermal conduction along the x axis in the rock matrix could be of importance in the conduction dominated regimes with slow fluid velocity cheng et al 2001 martinez et al 2014 ignoring longitudinal thermal conduction in the rock matrix might result in non negligible errors of thermal flux between the fracture and rock matrix and temperature distribution in the system martinez et al 2014 in this case two or three dimensional models considering thermal conduction and convection along all directions in all domains will be more appropriate such as the two dimensional model proposed by martinez et al 2014 and three dimensional models developed by cheng et al 2001 and ghassemi et al 2005 lastly despite the importance of understanding heat transfer in the single fracture and the abundant studies presented in section 1 there are no direct laboratory and field experiments to validate the proposed model the lack of direct experimental studies and field measurements on this subject may be caused by following reasons 1 it is challenging to conduct experiments in an ideal single fracture rock matrix system 2 investigators have most of their attention on fluid flow and heat transfer in the more permeable media such as fractures and aquifers and ignore the influence of the ambient rock matrix 3 there is no theoretical model available for heat transfer in the single fracture rock matrix system considering thermal conduction convection and dispersion simultaneously we hope the newly proposed analytical model in this study may facilitate the interests of experimental studies for heat transfer in the single fracture rock matrix system 7 conclusions this study presents a transient analytical model for thermal energy transfer in the single fracture rock matrix to investigate the importance of various thermal transfer mechanisms in the system and the role of thermal properties in the rock matrix the heat transfer processes in the fracture and rock matrix are fully coupled as temperature and thermal flux are continuous all the time at the fracture rock interfaces the following heat transfer processes in the fracture and rock matrix are accounted for simultaneously longitudinal thermal conduction thermal dispersion and thermal convection in the fracture and transverse thermal conduction in the rock matrix the analytical solutions are derived in the laplace domain with the help of numerical laplace transform techniques one can achieve the solutions in the real time domain and investigate the spatiotemporal temperature distribution and temperature evolution in the system through the comparison with previous studies the newly proposed model and solutions are proven to be robust and accurate in addition the following major conclusions are made from the investigation and analysis 1 the fracture geometry and fluid velocity are important to thermal energy transfer in the system for example thermal energy is observed to propagate faster in the wider fractures fig 2 the inaccurate estimation and measurement of fracture geometry and fluid velocity will cause non negligible errors in the assessment of the temperature distribution in the fracture and rock matrix system 2 greater thermal conductivity and thermal dispersivity in the fracture result in faster thermal transfer in the fracture and rock matrix figs 3 4 when the fracture has a low thermal conductivity less than 0 615 w m 1 c 1 and thermal dispersivity in the fracture less than 0 01 m the effects of thermal conduction and dispersion in the fracture on the spatiotemporal temperature distribution in the system is negligible however with greater values thermal dispersion in the fracture becomes very important and cannot be ignored missing thermal dispersion in the fracture will underestimate the fracture temperature distribution 3 unlike solute transport in the fracture rock matrix system which often ignored the hydrogeological properties of rock matrix zhu et al 2016 thermal properties of the rock matrix are important to heat transfer in the fracture rock matrix system a greater thermal conductivity k m in the rock matrix will transfer more heat in the rock matrix and cause significant temperature changes not only in the rock matrix but also in the fracture see fig 6 a lower temperature is observed in the fracture with greater thermal conductivity in the rock matrix 4 according to the local and global sensitivity analysis thermal energy transfer in the fracture rock matrix system is sensitive to the water flow velocity thermal dispersivity in the fracture and thermal conductivity in the rock matrix and insensitive to thermal conductivity in the fracture figs 8 9 declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

1341,in this study a fully coupled analytical model is developed for thermal energy transfer in a single fracture rock matrix system where the coupling implies that the governing equations of thermal transfer in the fracture and rock matrix are supplemented with the continuity conditions of temperature and thermal flux at the interfaces of the fracture rock matrix the proposed model accounts for thermal convection longitudinal thermal conduction and thermal dispersion in the fracture and transverse thermal conduction in the rock matrix the fully coupled two dimensional model is established to investigate the thermal energy transfer processes assess the spatiotemporal temperature distribution in the fracture and rock matrix system and investigate the role of the rock matrix the solutions are verified with the existing studies and proven to be accurate and robust the present study demonstrates that 1 thermal dispersion in the fracture plays an important role in the temperature distribution in the fracture and rock matrix domains and longitudinal thermal conduction in the fracture has minor effects on the temperature distribution in the system 2 transverse thermal conduction in the rock matrix is a critical parameter that determines the spatiotemporal temperature distribution in both the fracture and the rock matrix domains ignoring thermal conduction in the rock matrix will lead to a significant overestimation of temperature in the short and long terms 3 the sensitivity analysis implies that thermal energy transfer in the system is sensitive to the fluid velocity in the fracture thermal dispersivity in the fracture and thermal conductivity in the rock matrix and less sensitive to thermal conductivity in the fracture keywords thermal transfer reactive transport

feng et al 2020 lu 2018 zhu et al 2015 therefore understanding thermal transfer in the fracture rock matrix system drives the improvement of egs exploration wang et al 2020a since a more complex fracture network is integrated by the rather simple intersected discrete fractures and the surrounding rock matrix it is critical to understand the transport processes of mass and heat transfer in the single fracture rock matrix system to characterize and predict mass transport and heat transfer behaviors in a complex fracture network zhou et al 2018 zhou et al 2017 zhou and zhan 2018 mass transport and heat transfer in the fracture rock matrix system have been intensively investigated for decades a variety of numerical approaches such as finite element method fem and finite difference methods fdm have been used to analyze the heat transfer mechanisms and evaluate the performance of thermal energy recovery in fractured porous media and aquifers ghassemi and zhou 2011 he et al 2019 kolditz 1995 luo et al 2016 rutqvist et al 2002 despite the apparent simplifications the estimation about heat distribution in discrete fracture networks and the analysis of heat transfer behaviors in the fractured porous routinely rely on analytical and semi analytical models for example in the single fracture rock matrix system numerical models might be severely affected by the non negligible numerical errors and meshing challenges because of the extreme narrow fracture aperture and the sharp property transition across the fracture and rock matrix interface grisak and pickens 1981 zhou et al 2018 the analytical models can provide robust assessments under such scenarios and are irreplaceable for benchmarking the numerical models van genuchten et al 2013 zhou et al 2017 thermal transfer in the fractured porous media mainly occurs in the fracture fluid and the tight rock matrix with low permeability as their apparent differences heat transfer in the fracture is governed by thermal convection dispersion and conduction while heat transfer in the rock matrix is approximated by thermal conduction several classical solutions for convective thermal transfer in the fractured geothermal reservoir and the aquifer aquitard system induced by the injection were proposed by bödvarsson and tsang 1982 and chen and reddell 1983 to assess the long term temperature distribution and the estimation of aquifer thermal properties yang et al 1998 studied the irregularly interconnected discrete fractures and estimated the temperature distribution and hydrothermal circulation in the discretely fractured porous media through special adaption of a new finite element numerical algorithm they concluded that the discrete fractures could induce and maintain hydrothermal fluid circulation in the porous media and thus significantly change an established convection pattern in their appendix an analytical solution for heat transfer in discrete fractures accounting for thermal convection and conduction in the fracture rock matrix system was also presented to validate their newly proposed numerical model the detailed distinction between the mathematical solutions of yang et al 1998 and the present study can be found in the section of discussion chevalier and banton 1999a 1999b studied heat transfer in confined aquifers and fractured aquifers with pumping or injection wells by the random walk method the stochastic method can be particularly useful on the highly heterogenous media and fractured aquifers cheng et al 2001 ghassemi et al 2003 and ghassemi et al 2005 provided models for two dimensional and three dimensional heat conduction in a single fracture induced by wells with green s function methods and numerical methods and observed that higher temperatures from the multidimensional methods compared to the one dimensional method the temperature increase was more significant near the injection well and in the long term martinez et al 2014 presented a two dimensional analytical model considering longitudinal and transverse thermal energy conduction and convection in a single fracture with a two way coupling between heat transfer in fracture and the surrounding infinite matrix a fracture matrix peclet number was defined to analyze the efficiency of geothermal systems their solutions were served as a useful tool for benchmarking numerical studies parametric sensitivity analysis geothermal reservoir evaluation and management however the influence of thermal dispersion in the fracture was ignored in the studies above because of the dominant role of advective fluid flow in the fracture one should note that the mathematical solutions developed for mass transport in the porous media are amenable to heat transfer problems because of the mathematical and physical analogy wang et al 2020a however the relative importance of different transport mechanisms can be vastly different in solute transport and heat transfer for instance molecular diffusion may be too small to consider in most solute transport problems if the groundwater is not completely motionless but thermal conduction which is analogous to diffusion for solute transport can be a very effective and sometimes the dominant mechanism for transferring thermal energy another fact is that solid matrix is very efficient for conducting heat but they are impermeable for conducting solute because of such differences there are still considerable debates on the role of thermal dispersion some investigators argue that thermal dispersion is insignificant because of the strong conductive heat transfer bear 1972 cheng et al 2001 ingebritsen et al 2006 while other investigators argue that thermal dispersion is very important and must be considered for any field projects de ghislain 1986 hopmans et al 2002 rau et al 2012 smith and chapman 1983 even for the investigators who agreed that thermal dispersion should be considered there are still considerable debate on whether the thermal dispersivity is the same or not as the solute dispersivity for instance sauty et al 1982 argued that the magnitude of thermal dispersivity should be the same or very similar to the magnitude of solute dispersivity other investigators such as hufschmied 1985 constantz et al 2003 and vandenbohede et al 2009 argued that the magnitude of thermal dispersivity should be less than the magnitude of the solute dispersivity the previous studies indicated that the influence of thermal dispersion is proportional to the flow velocity lin et al 2019 pedras and de lemos 2008 rau et al 2012 zhou et al 2019 and included the velocity dependent thermal dispersion into their models for heat transfer in the fractures and aquifer thermal energy storage ates the objectives of this study are to develop an analytical model for describing the transient thermal energy distribution in the discrete fractures assess the relative importance of each individual thermal transfer processes and investigate the role of rock matrix in controlling heat transfer in the fracture rock matrix system thermal convection longitudinal thermal conduction and thermal dispersion in the fracture and transverse thermal conduction in the rock matrix are accounted for in the model the thermal energy transfer in the fracture and rock matrix is fully coupled where the coupling implies that the governing equations of thermal transfer in the fracture and rock matrix are connected with two continuity conditions temperature and thermal flux are continuous at the interfaces of the fracture rock matrix heat transfer in the rock matrix is governed by transverse thermal conduction as an important thermal transfer mechanism the thermal dispersive transfer is usually considered in the solute transport problem but often ignored when dealing with heat transfer issues in this study the influence of thermal dispersion and thermal conduction in the fracture are incorporated simultaneously to characterize the temperature distribution in such a fully coupled two dimensional fracture rock matrix system 2 conceptual model and physical setup the conceptual scheme is presented in fig 1 a single fracture is situated horizontally and confined by the homogeneous rock matrix the orientation of the single fracture can be in any direction as gravity is not a concern here so the presentation of a horizontally sited single fracture in fig 1 is merely for the sake of illustration the fracture is thin with a constant aperture of 2b and extends sufficiently far from the domain of interest the rock matrix is wide and outspreads far vertically from the fracture which implies that the influence of the matrix outer boundaries is ignored the overlying and underlying rock matrices have identical hydrological and thermal properties and are symmetrically distributed with respect to the middle plane of the fracture accordingly a cartesian coordinate system is defined to characterize the transfer processes under the groundwater background flow from left to right through the fracture at a constant rate following the groundwater flow direction the x axis is orientated horizontally from left to right along the middle plane of the fracture the z axis is located vertically upward along the left inlet boundary of the system and perpendicular to the x axis the y axis is horizontally oriented and perpendicular to the x z plane the origin is located at the intersection of the x y and z axes which is also the junction of the left system boundary and the middle plane of the fracture the heat source is located at x 0 with a constant temperature t 0 and extends infinite far from the origin along the y axis thus the model can be simplified and reduced to a two dimensional model in x z plane without accounting for the y axis furthermore due to the symmetric distribution of the rock matrix properties and geometries regarding the x axis the overlying rock matrix has the identical thermal energy distribution and heat transfer behaviors to the underlying rock matrix thus the fracture rock matrix model only needs to consider the upper half plane associated with the thermal energy transfer processes considered in this model the following assumptions are made regarding the properties and geometries of the fracture and rock matrix 1 the rock matrix is composed of tight materials and several orders of magnitude less permeable than the fracture the apparent differences in transport properties justify that the groundwater flow is mainly limited to the open fracture and thermal convection in the rock matrix is ignored in the present model 2 at t 0 the fracture rock matrix has an initial temperature which is a constant t i across the entire system the heat source is located at x 0 with a constant temperature t o 3 when temperature is not changed dramatically and significantly it is feasible and reasonable to assume that the thermal and physical properties of the fluid and solid materials are not temperature dependent stopa and wojnarowski 2006 4 the interfaces between fracture and rock matrix are smooth and parallel to each other the groundwater flow within the fracture is laminar and impressible therefore the influence of gravity and fracture roughness can be negligible 5 the fracture is rather thin and hence the transverse thermal conduction in the fracture can be ignored bödvarsson and tsang 1982 6 the thermal flux in the rock matrix is primarily caused by the temperature gradient between the fracture and rock matrix along the transverse direction thus longitudinal thermal conduction in the rock matrix is neglectable and thermal energy transfer in the rock matrix can be approximated by transverse thermal conduction only li et al 2010 7 although the fracture sediment infilling is observed in some experimental and theoretical studies wealthall et al 2001 zhou et al 2017 the fracture is much more porous and permeable than the surrounding rock matrix the sediment infilling and pore water in the fracture are considered as one homogeneous continuum based on the assumption that it is instantaneous for the sediment infilling and pore water in the fracture to reach local thermal equilibrium the one domain approach is adopted to describe the thermal energy transfer processes in the fracture 3 mathematical modeling the thermal energy transfer processes in the fracture rock matrix see fig 1 are coupled and governed by the following partial differential equations pdes in the fracture and rock matrix complying with fourier s law since the thermal parameters are not temperature dependent in this study the governing equations for heat transfer are analogous to solute transport problems

of the fracture and rock matrix kg m 3 respectively c f and c m are specific heat of the fracture and rock matrix j kg 1 c 1 respectively it is worthwhile to point out that the product of ρ and c is usually referred to as volumetric thermal capacity j m 3 c 1 which can be determined based on the properties of the porous media and the liquid ρ m c m 1 ϕ m ρ s c s ϕ m ρ w c w where ρ s and ρ w are the densities of the solid grains and water in the rock matrix kg m 3 respectively c s and c w are specific heat of the solid grains and water in the rock matrix j kg 1 c 1 respectively ϕ m is the porosity of the rock matrix 2b is the aperture of the fracture m q is thermal conductive flux across the wall between the facture and the rock matrix w m 2 k m is the average transverse thermal conductivity of the rock matrix w m 1 c 1 which can be evaluated by k m 1 ϕ m k s ϕ m k w where k s and k w are thermal conductivities of the solid and water in the rock matrix respectively the value of k m is dependent on the moisture content k f is effective thermal conductivity of the fracture w m 1 c 1 note that effective thermal conduction in the fracture consists of thermal dispersion and thermal conduction therefore as a homogeneous continuum effective thermal conductivity k f in the fracture is composed of two critical components k f k l k d where k l is longitudinal thermal conductivity w m 1 c 1 and k d is thermal dispersion coefficient w m 1 c 1 according to the previous studies rau et al 2012 stauffer et al 2013 zhou et al 2019 the thermal dispersion coefficient k d can be estimated as the product of thermal dispersivity fluid thermal capacity porosity and flow velocity k d ϕ f ρ w c w βv where β is thermal dispersivity m a high flow velocity will increase the value of thermal dispersion in such a fully coupled fracture rock matrix system thermal energy is transferred into the rock matrix from the fracture because of thermal conduction the thermal conductive flux across the fracture rock matrix interface can be expressed as the following equation 3 q k m t mat z z b temperature is assumed to be continuous across the interface between the fracture and rock matrix z b which means that the fracture temperature is the same as the temperature of the rock matrix at the fracture rock matrix interface 4 t mat x z b t t fra x t initially the fracture rock matrix system has a constant temperature t i the heat source with constant temperature t 0 is located at x 0 the first type boundary is employed to describe the boundary condition here the fracture and rock matrix are sufficiently far the rock matrix extends infinitely wide from the domain of interest therefore the influence of the outer boundaries can be ignored the fracture and rock matrix are subject to the following initial and boundary conditions 5 t fra x t 0 t i t fra x 0 t t 0 t fra x t t i 6 t mat x z t 0 t i t mat x z t t i to normalize the fracture rock matrix

the original pdes are converted to ordinary differential equations odes considering the boundary conditions of the fracture and rock matrix one can solve the odes and achieve the analytical solutions

1982 the de hoog inverse laplace transform algorithm has been extensively used in solving mass and heat transfer problems and provides successful inverse laplace transfer calculations wang et al 2020b wang and zhan 2015 in this study it is implemented with a matlab script the solutions are then used to compare with the previous study for the verification purpose analyze the spatiotemporal temperature distribution in the fracture rock matrix system and estimate the relative importance of some hydrological and thermal properties on the temperature distribution and evolution 4 results and discussion 4 1 comparison with the previous solutions examples and case studies are used to present the newly derived semi analytical solutions and analyze the spatiotemporal temperature distribution in the fracture rock matrix system unless specified otherwise the following values of thermal and hydraulic properties are adopted in this section from previous studies martinez et al 2014 yang et al

higher temperature of 50 c hot water flows in the fracture at a constant velocity v of 1 6 10 4 m s the fracture has a porosity ϕ f of 95 and a full aperture 2b of 1 10 3m the influence of thermal dispersion coefficient k d in the fracture is velocity dependent and defined as k d ϕ f ρ w c w βv the values of thermal dispersivity β are usually obtained from the regression and statistical analysis between the field observations and mathematical simulations xu and eckstein 1995 to better illustrate the model results and investigate the thermal energy transfer processes without losing generality two points of interest are selected rather arbitrarily in the fracture and rock matrix p1 0 5 m 0 m at the middle plane of the fracture and p2 0 5 m 0 5 m in the rock matrix respectively as the symmetric distribution of the hydrologic and thermal properties regarding x 0 the spatiotemporal thermal distribution in the lower half plane is identical to that in the upper half plane therefore p2 0 5 m 0 5 m is used to represent the thermal distribution in both overlying and underlying rock matrices the advection time tv x is a dimensionless parameter that has been widely adopted in the studies of solute transport and heat transfer to present and analyze the results martinez et al 2014 zhou et al 2017 the advective flow front reaches the point of interest in fracture when it is about 1 yang et al 1998 and martinez et al 2014 respectively developed one and two dimensional models for heat transfer in the similar geological settings composed of the discrete fractures and rock matrix as distinct from yang s one dimensional mathematical solution yang et al 1998 considering thermal conduction and convection in the open fracture the present study accounts for the solid sediments filled in discrete fractures which typically slows down the fluid velocity and affects thermal convection and conduction in the fractures acknowledging the existence of the sediment infilling commonly observed in the facture wealthall et al 2001 the model for heat transfer in the fracture rock matrix system derived in this study can be used to not only analyze heat transfer in the filled fracture rock matrix system but also interpret the thermal energy distribution in other geological settings such as heat transfer in the unconformities and aquifer aquitard system as discussed extensively lin et al 2019 zhou et al 2019 the influence of thermal dispersivity is related to fluid velocity also yang s solution yang et al 1998 assumed that thermal dispersivity is a constant and independent from all other parameters which may fail to characterize the relative importance of thermal dispersity and assess the heat distribution lin et al 2019 zhou et al 2019 in this study the influence of thermal dispersivity is estimated as fluid velocity dependent the present solutions of temperature distribution in the fracture and rock matrix can be easily migrated to simulate heat transfer under radial flow induced by wells with variable velocities over radial distance to verify the model the newly derived solutions are compared with the analytical solutions developed by yang et al 1998 and martinez et al 2014 by assuming the fracture is fully open with liquid component only ϕ f 100 and ignoring velocity dependent thermal dispersivity in the fracture β 0 the model developed in this study is similar to the solutions proposed by yang et al 1998 and martinez et al 2014 when longitudinal thermal conduction in the rock matrix is ignored as one can see the thermal breakthrough curves in fig 2 the normalized temperature at p1 0 5 m 0 m from this study solid lines reaches an excellent agreement with the normalized temperature solved by the previous studies dots and crosses with various fracture apertures which proves the robustness and accuracy of the newly proposed solutions 4 2 thermal breakthrough curve analysis as exhibited in fig 2 the normalized thermal breakthrough curves btcs at p1 0 5 m 0 m in the fracture t f are plotted against advective time with various fracture apertures with wider fracture apertures more thermal energy is transferred into the system from the heat source through the fracture thus higher temperature is observed in the fracture with one homogeneous continuum assumption the thermal energy is transferred by thermal convective thermal conductive and thermal dispersive transfer processes in the fracture the relative effects of thermal conduction and thermal dispersion on the thermal breakthrough curves of the fracture and rock matrix are depicted in the following figures when the values of thermal conductivity range from 0 w m 1 c 1 to 0 615 w m 1 c 1 thermal conduction in the fracture has almost no influence on heat transfer in the system from 0 615 w m 1 c 1 to 6 15 w m 1 c 1 a higher thermal conductivity leads to a slightly faster thermal transfer rate in the fracture according to the data measured and compiled by čermák and rybach 1982 a common range of thermal conductivity of different minerals and rocks is 0 4 7 0 w m 1 c 1 in general unconsolidated sedimentary rocks with little water content such as dry gravel and sandstone have low thermal conductivity values higher thermal conductivity values are found to be associated with most igneous metamorphic and sedimentary rocks especially for felsic igneous rocks rocks with high quartz elements and water components labus and labus 2018 most liquids have thermal conductivities less than 2 w m 1 c 1 vargaftik et al 2020 as one of the most common liquids observed in the fractures and aquifers water has thermal conductivity of 0 58 w m 1 c 1 carvill 1994 adopting reasonable values of fracture thermal conductivity one can conclude that thermal conduction has a minor influence on heat transfer in the fracture rock matrix system being part of effective thermal conduction in the fracture the influence of thermal dispersion on the temperature distribution in the fracture and rock matrix is presented in fig 4 thermal energy is transferred faster in the fracture and rock matrix when the value of thermal dispersity in the fracture is greater because of the lack of direct laboratory and field scale measurements on the values of thermal dispersivity in the fracture the values adopted in this study are based on assumptions and previous theoretical investigations anderson 2005 bou jaoude et al 2018 lin et al 2019 bou jaoude et al 2018 assumed a direct relationship between mass transport dispersivity and thermal dispersivity and considered that the fracture thermal dispersivity was ranged from 0 1 m to 3 m lin et al 2019 adopted the values of thermal dispersivity ranging from 0 m to 5 m to be representative without losing generality the values of thermal dispersivity in the fracture are assumed to range from 0 m to 5 m in fig 4 thermal breakthrough curves at points of interest are plotted with various thermal dispersivities in the fracture starting from 0 001 m with a ten fold increase until the upper limit when thermal dispersivity in the fracture is one or several orders of magnitude smaller than 0 01 m its influence on the temperature distribution in the fracture and rock matrix is minor compared to the case without thermal dispersivity therefore thermal dispersion in the fracture can be ignored without causing significant errors when thermal dispersivity in the fracture is greater than 0 01 m its influence on the temperature distribution in the system becomes more important and should not be ignored similar results about the temperature distribution over distance are depicted in fig 5 when thermal dispersivity has a very small value its influence on the temperature distribution in the fracture and rock matrix is minor the role of thermal dispersivity becomes more important at greater values thermal energy propagates further away from the origin in the fracture and extends deeper in the rock matrix when the value of thermal dispersivity is greater although the rock matrix is less permeable and porous heat is transferred from the fracture into the rock matrix by thermal conduction depicted by fig 6 with higher thermal conductivity in the rock matrix k m more thermal energy is transferred into the rock matrix from the fracture which leads to the lower temperature observed in the fracture 5 sensitivity analysis 5 1 local sensitivity analysis the normalized sensitivity method has been widely used in the studies of parameters analysis and uncertainties in mass transport in the fractures and aquifers huang and yeh 2007 kabala 2001 zhou et al 2017 it evaluates the relative influence of the input parameters on the output results by assuming a small positive increment on the input parameters which can be expressed mathematically by 13 k i j x j r i x j where x j is the j th input parameter of x r i is the output result which is the function of x j and other parameters k i j is the normalized sensitivity coefficient regarding the input parameter x j if the partial differential equation r i x j is approximated by a forward differencing algorithm eq 16 can be estimated by 14 k i j x j r i x j x j r i x j δ x j r i x j δ x j where δx j is a small positive increment of the input parameter x in many previous studies the value of δx j is set to 1 of x j δx j 0 01 x j substituting it into eq 17 one can estimate the value of normalized sensitivity coefficient as k i j 100 r i x j δx j r i x j it is found that the calculated normalized sensitivity coefficient is dependent on its relative importance and the values of the input parameter x j due to the lack of direct measurements of thermal dispersivity in the fracture from laboratory and field investigations its normalized sensitivity coefficient is plotted individually at various dispersivity values in fig 7 the temperature distribution in the fracture and rock matrix reveals that the relative influence of thermal dispersivity increases first and then decreases after its peak value the normalized sensitivity coefficient in the fracture reaches its peak value earlier than that in the rock matrix and it indicates that temperature in the fracture is more sensitive to thermal dispersion than that in the rock matrix when thermal dispersivity values are greater it becomes more influential but still less important compared to velocity which is consistent with the analysis in section 4 2 the values of longitudinal thermal conductivity in the fracture transverse thermal conductivity in the rock matrix and groundwater flow velocity in the fracture are well studied and measured their normalized sensitivity coefficients are plotted and compared in fig 8 the groundwater flow velocity in the facture has the greatest influence on the temperature in the fracture and rock matrix system among all three parameters the main reason is that the fracture is open and highly porous and the flow field in such system is dominated by the water flow in the fracture comparing the relative impact of fracture longitudinal thermal conductivity and transverse thermal conductivity in the rock matrix it is worthwhile to note that the thermal conductivity of the rock matrix is more influential than that of the fracture the thermal energy in the system is the least sensitive to longitudinal thermal conduction in the fracture among the three parameters mentioned it is recommended that the greatest efforts should be put on the determination of the flow field in the fracture and the thermal properties in the rock matrix due to their relative importance and sensitivity the system is less sensitive to thermal conduction in the fracture when thermal transfer is dominated by thermal convection 5 2 global sensitivity analysis although the local sensitivity analysis is easy to conduct and provides straightforward results its main drawback is also obvious it provides sensitivity analysis only at the local values where they are adopted for computation and does not consider the rest of the variation range of the model s input parameters it works fine when the values of input parameters are well measured however when the values of the input parameter have wide variation ranges such as thermal dispersivity in this study the local sensitivity analysis may fail to provide a consistent sensitivity estimation at all values campolongo and saltelli 1997 hamby 1994 for instance as shown in fig 7 different thermal dispersivity values in the fracture lead to distinct normalized sensitivity coefficients to better evaluate the influence of the input parameters on the output results and the interactions between the input parameters in their practical ranges several global sensitivity analysis techniques have been successfully employed in hydrological models like the screening method regression analysis variance based meta modeling method and others song et al 2015 tian 2013 in this study we adopt the morris method morris 1991 for the global sensitivity analysis of the thermal properties as one of the most common screening methods the morris method morris 1991 is a one step at a time sensitivity analysis design and provides an efficient and reliable approach to identify and rank important variables king and perera 2013 morris 1991 it includes following steps to assess the global sensitivity of each input parameter first the input parameter will be sampled in its possible range over a certain sampling points 0 1 q 1 2 q 1 3 q 1 q 2 q 1 1 where q is the number of samples within the range of each input parameter in this study a sample size is chosen to be 100 q 100 as discussed in section 4 the practical values of thermal dispersivity thermal conductivity in the fracture and thermal conductivity in the rock matrix are set to be 0 m 5 m 0 01 w m 1 c 1 2 w m 1 c 1 and 0 4 w m 1 c 1 7 w m 1 c 1 respectively second for a model with k variables one needs to construct a k 1 k sampling matrix b k 1 k with elements of 0 and 1 as b k 1 k 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 each column is changed one step at a time by a perturbed interval it can be written as the following matrix in terms of the input parameters p k 1 k p 1 p 2 p 3 p k p 1 δ p 1 p 2 p 3 p k p 1 δ p 1 p 2 δ p 2 p 3 p k p 1 δ p 1 p 2 δ p 2 p 3 δ p 3 p k p 1 δ p 1 p 2 δ p 2 p 3 δ p 3 p k δ p k in which δ refers to a small increment defined previously as 1 q 1 lastly for each input parameter p i the elementary effect ee i is evaluated as 15 e e i y p 1 p 2 p i δ p i p i 1 p k y p 1 p 2 p i p i 1 p k δ where y is the output result morris 1991 proposed two measures to assess the sensitivity mean μ i and standard deviation σ i the value of mean μ i is a measure of the overall influence by the input parameters on output results a greater μ i for a given parameter indicates that the parameter has a higher overall influence on the output results conversely a parameter with a μ i value that is closer to zero in contrast to other parameters implies a low sensitivity the standard deviation σ i is a measure to assess the possible interactions of the input variables with others in statistics interaction effect refers to the simultaneous effects of two or more independent variables on the output since the impact of one independent input parameter on the output results is not the same for all levels of other independent parameters interaction occurs when the influence of one independent parameter alters depending on another independent parameters pacheco torgal et al 2018 in other words it illustrates how two or more independent variables work together to impact the output results if the parameter has a larger σ i it indicates that the parameter has greater interactions with other input variables campolongo and braddock 1999 king and perera 2013 lin et al 2019 morris 1991 the two measures are defined as 16 μ i n 1 r e e n r 17 σ i 1 r n 1 r e e n μ i 2 where r is total sampling number and chosen to be 100 in this study the values of μ i and σ i are calculated with the help of a matlab toolbox pianosi et al 2015 in fig 9 we plot the global sensitivity analysis curves observed at x 0 5 m in the fracture for thermal dispersivity in the fracture β thermal conductivity in the fracture k l and thermal conductivity in the rock matrix k m based on mean left and standard deviation right the ees mean curves reveal that the temperature in the fracture is sensitive to β and k m and insensitive to k l meanwhile the ees standard deviation curves suggest that β has strong interactions with other parameters followed by k m a strong interaction implies that the effects of other variables such as k m and k l in the present study on the output results significantly depend on the state of β the interaction effects between k l and other variable are very weak compared to others the results in the standard deviation curves are consistent with those in the mean curves both measures indicate that heat transfer in the single fracture rock matrix system is very sensitive to thermal dispersivity in the fracture followed by thermal conductivity in the rock matrix the thermal property of the rock matrix plays a key role in heat transfer in the fracture rock matrix system which should not be ignored the temperature is insensitive to thermal conductivity in the fracture in summary the local and global sensitivity analysis about flow velocity and thermal conduction are consistent with the findings from the previous studies bou jaoude et al 2018 martinez et al 2014 the fluid velocity in the fracture is a critical parameter that governs the thermal energy transfer behaviors in discrete fractures thermal conductivity in the rock matrix and thermal dispersivity in the fracture play important roles in characterizing the temperature distribution in the fracture rock matrix system the results about thermal dispersivity are consistent with the observations from rau et al 2012 and metzger et al 2004 longitudinal thermal conduction in the fracture has the least effect on the heat distribution in the fracture rock matrix system ignoring the existence of longitudinal thermal conductive transport in the fracture may not cause significant error in such settings 6 limitations of the work this study provides important and innovative contributions that help us gain insights into thermal transport in a fracture matrix system however we should also be aware of the limitations of the study which will be briefly outlined as follows firstly the geometry of the fracture is simple for the sake of analytical treatment thus variation of fracture aperture and fracture wall roughness are not considered which both can affect the spatiotemporal distribution of the temperature if variable fracture aperture and fracture wall roughness can be known for instance in the laboratory experiments using x ray or scanning techniques rong et al 2020 tan et al 2020 then one may be able to use numerical modeling to investigate thermal transfer in a fracture rock system however one should bear in mind that detailed in situ fracture aperture variation and fracture wall roughness are rarely known in real field applications thus the simple fracture geometry becomes a practical approximation to deal with the problem one should be cautious that the analytical modeling based on the simple fracture geometry is mostly used to gain the understanding about the thermal transport processes in a fracture rock matrix system but it cannot be used directly for engineering design of field projects when fracture apertures vary considerably and or fracture wall roughness becomes a major concern of flow and transport furthermore the analytical modeling here can be used as a reference to benchmark complicated numerical modeling which may suffer from considerable numerical errors and or sometimes fail to converge when the media flow and transport properties change dramatically over sharp boundaries such as the fracture rock matrix interfaces also this study cannot be directly used for fracture networks involving many different fractures with all sorts of orientations apertures and roughness secondly the rock matrix is assumed to be identical above and below the fracture if the two rock matrix components above and below the fracture have different media properties which is a case specifically investigated by zhu and zhan 2018 one has to deal with the full plane instead of the half plane as done in this study the extension from a half plane conceptual model to a full plane conceptual model is possible following a similar approach used by zhu and zhan 2018 but will not be shown there as it is out of the main focus of this study thirdly we assume two thermal continuity conditions among different domains in this study temperature and thermal flux are continuous at the interfaces of the fracture rock matrix the thermal discontinuity due to nanoscale interfacial effects and possible complexity at the interface are not considered in this study bai et al 2018 balasubramanian and puri 2011 the investigation of thermal discontinuity may be conducted with modified boundary conditions in the future fourthly since the fracture is rather thin transverse thermal conduction and convection along z axis in the fracture are ignore and only heat transfer processes along the x axis are accounted for also as the thermal flux in the rock matrix is primarily caused by the temperature gradient along the direction of the z axis it is assumed that thermal transfer in the rock matrix is merely governed by transverse thermal conduction along the z axis li et al 2010 thus the two dimensional model proposed in this study is governed by two heat transfer equations with one way transfer processes in the fracture and rock matrix respectively in the convection dominated regimes such as highly porous aquifers and fractures the forementioned assumptions work well without producing unacceptable errors in the short term assessment cheng et al 2001 a one dimensional model with lower computational cost is appropriate to use with reasonable accuracy rezaei et al 2013 roubinet et al 2012 however the existence of longitudinal thermal conduction along the x axis in the rock matrix could be of importance in the conduction dominated regimes with slow fluid velocity cheng et al 2001 martinez et al 2014 ignoring longitudinal thermal conduction in the rock matrix might result in non negligible errors of thermal flux between the fracture and rock matrix and temperature distribution in the system martinez et al 2014 in this case two or three dimensional models considering thermal conduction and convection along all directions in all domains will be more appropriate such as the two dimensional model proposed by martinez et al 2014 and three dimensional models developed by cheng et al 2001 and ghassemi et al 2005 lastly despite the importance of understanding heat transfer in the single fracture and the abundant studies presented in section 1 there are no direct laboratory and field experiments to validate the proposed model the lack of direct experimental studies and field measurements on this subject may be caused by following reasons 1 it is challenging to conduct experiments in an ideal single fracture rock matrix system 2 investigators have most of their attention on fluid flow and heat transfer in the more permeable media such as fractures and aquifers and ignore the influence of the ambient rock matrix 3 there is no theoretical model available for heat transfer in the single fracture rock matrix system considering thermal conduction convection and dispersion simultaneously we hope the newly proposed analytical model in this study may facilitate the interests of experimental studies for heat transfer in the single fracture rock matrix system 7 conclusions this study presents a transient analytical model for thermal energy transfer in the single fracture rock matrix to investigate the importance of various thermal transfer mechanisms in the system and the role of thermal properties in the rock matrix the heat transfer processes in the fracture and rock matrix are fully coupled as temperature and thermal flux are continuous all the time at the fracture rock interfaces the following heat transfer processes in the fracture and rock matrix are accounted for simultaneously longitudinal thermal conduction thermal dispersion and thermal convection in the fracture and transverse thermal conduction in the rock matrix the analytical solutions are derived in the laplace domain with the help of numerical laplace transform techniques one can achieve the solutions in the real time domain and investigate the spatiotemporal temperature distribution and temperature evolution in the system through the comparison with previous studies the newly proposed model and solutions are proven to be robust and accurate in addition the following major conclusions are made from the investigation and analysis 1 the fracture geometry and fluid velocity are important to thermal energy transfer in the system for example thermal energy is observed to propagate faster in the wider fractures fig 2 the inaccurate estimation and measurement of fracture geometry and fluid velocity will cause non negligible errors in the assessment of the temperature distribution in the fracture and rock matrix system 2 greater thermal conductivity and thermal dispersivity in the fracture result in faster thermal transfer in the fracture and rock matrix figs 3 4 when the fracture has a low thermal conductivity less than 0 615 w m 1 c 1 and thermal dispersivity in the fracture less than 0 01 m the effects of thermal conduction and dispersion in the fracture on the spatiotemporal temperature distribution in the system is negligible however with greater values thermal dispersion in the fracture becomes very important and cannot be ignored missing thermal dispersion in the fracture will underestimate the fracture temperature distribution 3 unlike solute transport in the fracture rock matrix system which often ignored the hydrogeological properties of rock matrix zhu et al 2016 thermal properties of the rock matrix are important to heat transfer in the fracture rock matrix system a greater thermal conductivity k m in the rock matrix will transfer more heat in the rock matrix and cause significant temperature changes not only in the rock matrix but also in the fracture see fig 6 a lower temperature is observed in the fracture with greater thermal conductivity in the rock matrix 4 according to the local and global sensitivity analysis thermal energy transfer in the fracture rock matrix system is sensitive to the water flow velocity thermal dispersivity in the fracture and thermal conductivity in the rock matrix and insensitive to thermal conductivity in the fracture figs 8 9 declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

1342,steam injection technology is commonly used to rapidly remove volatile and semi volatile organic pollutants in aquifers and its remediation effect is highly related to steam migration and temperature distribution however systematic studies on steam migration and temperature distribution across different types of aquifers are lacking in this study the steam migration and temperature distribution in an aquifer were investigated through a series of two dimensional sandbox experiments with different groundwater velocities steam injection flow rates and stratigraphic structures the experimental results indicated that the temperature distribution in the aquifer was related to the formation permeability and steam injection flow rate when the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer was lower than 10 3 cm s 1 the heating zone in the aquifer had an h shaped distribution and when it was higher than 10 2 cm s 1 the heating zone had a v shaped distribution for a high steam injection flow rate 1 kgh 1 and an h shaped distribution for a low injection flow rate 0 5 kgh 1 under the same injection steam flow rate the total area of the heating zone in the aquifers with different media was in the following order of sand particle size coarse sand fine sand medium sand owing to the heat pipe and heat dispersion effects the heating zone area in the fine sand aquifer was larger than that of the medium sand aquifer groundwater velocity did not affect the area of the heating zone with the increase in groundwater velocity the heating zone expanded downstream in layered heterogeneous aquifers the upper fine and lower coarse structures formed a steam blocking interface resulting in steam accumulation and temperature increase in the lower layer these findings are significant for improving our understanding of steam migration and temperature distribution in aquifers leading to an improved design and prediction of the steam remediation required for mitigating aquifer pollution keywords steam injection technology v shaped distribution heat pipe effect steam migration heating zone area aquifer 1 introduction in situ thermal remediation istr is a method of heating the contaminated area in situ to considerably increase the temperature of soil and groundwater thereby accelerating the volatilization of organic pollutants in the contaminated zone heron et al 2016 sun et al 2018d early and udell 2000 it can remove non aqueous phase liquid napl pollutants faster and more thoroughly triplett kingston et al 2010 sun et al 2018b udell 1998 istr mainly includes steam injection thermal conductivity heating and electrical resistance heating triplett kingston et al 2010 sun et al 2018a thermal conductivity heating is suitable for most hydrogeological conditions and can heat soil to higher than 500 c however this method is expensive electrical resistance heating generates heat by applying an electric current to the subsurface baker et al 2008 it is particularly suitable for treating low permeability strata electricity is mainly conducted through the water in soil pores and water or other solvents must be added to the strata during application hassanzadeh and harding 2016 sadeghi et al 2017 therefore this technology is often used in combination with steam injection heron et al 2005 udell 2000 steam injection is most effective when steam can enter the soil pores and is cheaper than other thermal techniques sun et al 2017 sun et al 2018e the removal of pollutants using steam injection technology is highly related to steam migration and temperature distribution however systematic research under different groundwater flow rates steam injection flows and formation structures remains lacking present research on steam migration is mainly theoretical and experimental ochs et al 2010 studied steam migration at high and low steam injection rates and found that at high steam injection rates the temperature distribution changed from radial diffusion at an early stage to ovoid at a later stage moreover the low injection rate resulted in a stronger vertical transmission owing to buoyancy by comparing the experimental results with the numerical simulation results the authors confirmed the applicability of the model as well as its limitations in simulating steam migration in addition this study did not consider the influence of groundwater velocity when investigating steam migration other studies have used models to simulate steam migration and transport of pollutants in aquifers nilsson et al 2011 pophillat et al 2018 the simulation results showed that the vertical permeability of the medium has a significant influence on the distribution of the water temperature when the vertical permeability is high the steam easily migrates upward resulting in a rapid increase in the aquifer temperature tse et al 2006 sun et al 2018c moreover in a high permeability medium heat convection is dominant fan and udell 1995 nilsson et al 2011 according to van lookeren 1983 the steam migration in aquifers is affected by buoyancy and the interaction between buoyancy and the viscous force generated by steam injection causes the radial propagation of steam the simulation also revealed that the shape of pollutant distribution was consistent with that of steam which transported the pollutants upward or horizontally tse et al 2006 schmidt et al 2002 at present most studies related to steam migration are simulation research however a gap remains between simulation and experimental research the experimental results can not only verify the simulation results but also reflect the mechanism of steam migration more accurately and intuitively therefore steam migration must be investigated experimentally under different permeability media groundwater velocities and steam injection flow rates heat transfer mainly depends on heat conduction and convection in aquifers sleep and mcclure 2001 the steam distribution mainly occurred by convection through the porous medium until it reached the region of condensation and subsequently heat was transferred to the cooler region butler 1991 davis 1997 al yousef et al 2014 the heat convection is weakened and the heat conduction and dispersion are enhanced in the low permeability zone pophillat et al 2020 therefore steam injection is limited by stratum permeability which in turn has a significant influence on steam migration basel and udell 1991 kramer 2014 kumar and hassanzadeh 2021b a simulation study by kumar and hassanzadeh 2021a found that the heterogeneity of shale during steam assisted gravity drainage can affect oil recovery which not only reduces oil drainage but also causes further heat loss peng et al 2013 studied the removal of trichloroethylene from heterogeneous soil in a two dimensional simulation tank their study found that the heat transfer of hot steam in the low permeability lens was stabilized and the removal efficiency of trichloroethylene decreased they mainly studied the removal efficiency of pollutants but did not extensively analyze the main mechanism for the decrease in pollutant removal efficiency therefore steam migration and temperature distribution in heterogeneous aquifers must be studied moreover most studies on heterogeneous aquifers have mainly focused on the pollutant removal rate but the steam migration mechanism has not been adequately explored the area of influence and temperature distribution of steam in aquifers play an important role in the design of steam injection wells and the prediction of pollutant removal therefore relevant research is necessary in summary the efficiency of the steam injection process depends mainly on steam migration and temperature distribution in this study a two dimensional simulation flume was used to investigate the effects of groundwater velocity steam flow rate and medium permeability on steam migration and temperature distribution the objectives of this study were to 1 quantitatively characterize the effect of groundwater velocity on the area of the heating zone and the thermally affected diameter 2 investigate the influence of steam flow rate on steam migration and temperature distribution 3 quantitatively analyze the influence of different permeability media on steam migration temperature distribution and steam affected area and 4 investigate the migration and distribution of steam in layered heterogeneous aquifers 2 materials and methods 2 1 influence of different groundwater velocities on steam migration to clarify the effect of groundwater velocity on steam migration an experiment was conducted in a large two dimensional simulation tank fig 1a with the following dimensions 110 cm length 50 cm height 8 cm width in each tank quartz sand mixed with fine sand was used as the main packing medium the physical properties of the quartz sand samples used in the tests are listed in table 1 a steam injection well was inserted into the tank with a few small holes at its base the steam injection well was positioned 54 5 cm from the left side of the tank and 50 4 cm from the right side the small holes were covered with gauze to prevent sand from entering the injection well fig 1 shows a schematic diagram of the experimental setup there were 60 sampling ports 10 columns 6 rows at the front of the tank to monitor the temperature using a multi channel temperature patrol instrument shen zhen hua xin measuring instrument company shen zhen china before the experiment tap water was continuously injected at a rate of 0 2 m d 1 by a peristaltic pump to ensure uniformity of the porous media and prevent the presence of entrapped air the inlet of the tank was set at the lower right and the outlet was set at the upper left a 3 kw steam generator norbest machinery manufacturing co ltd wuhan china was supplied by a constant flux of water to generate steam at a constant rate of 1 kg h 1 the steam generator produced saturated steam at a temperature of 120 c and a pressure of 200 kpa the temperatures were continuously measured in the sandbox in this study darcy s law was used to determine groundwater velocity groundwater flow rates were selected as 0 0 1 0 5 and 0 9 m d 1 respectively 2 2 influence of different media and steam flow rates on steam migration this experiment was conducted in a 60 cm length 50 cm height 4 cm width two dimensional simulation tank fig 2b the injection well installed at the bottom center of the tank for stem injection contained a cylinder diameter 4 cm height 7 5 cm and many tiny pores at the top the tiny pores were covered with gauze to prevent sand from entering the injection well there were 24 sampling ports at the front of the tank to monitor the temperature using a multi channel temperature patrol instrument shen zhen hua xin measuring instrument company shen zhen china for the experiment on the influence of different aquifer types on steam migration coarse sand 1 coarse sand 2 medium sand and fine sand were selected as the aquifer media the physical properties of the quartz sand samples used in the tests are listed in table 1 the steam flow rate was selected as 1 kg h 1 and the groundwater velocity was 0 m d 1 to determine the influence of steam flow on heat transfer the injection flow rates were set to 0 5 kg h 1 and 1 kg h 1 the medium of the aquifer was coarse sand 1 and the velocity of groundwater was 0 m d 1 other pre experiment operations were the same as those described previously 2 3 influence of layered heterogeneity on steam migration the experimental device of the layered heterogeneity experiment was the same as that used in the previous experiment described in section 2 2 the filling method is shown in fig 1c and the filling medium for each experiment is shown in table 2 the steam flow rate was set to 1 kg h 1 and the groundwater velocity was 0 m d 1 the other steps in the experiment were the same as those described previously 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of groundwater velocity on steam migration 3 1 1 temperature distribution under different groundwater velocities the temperature distribution at different groundwater velocities when hot steam was injected for 7 h is shown in fig 2 when the groundwater velocity is 0 m d 1 that is in the absence of groundwater velocity the temperature field exhibited a symmetrical distribution however with the increase in groundwater velocity the heating zone expanded downstream the heat transfer of hot steam mainly depends on heat conduction and convection in which heat convection plays a major role when the groundwater velocity was 0 m d 1 the heat transfer mainly depended on the heat convection generated by the steam migration thus the temperature was symmetrically distributed in the presence of groundwater velocity the steam and condensation front migrated downstream owing to the hydrodynamic effect and convection heat transfer occurred in the groundwater leading to the expansion of the heating zone downstream 3 1 2 thermal influence diameter and area of heating zone under different groundwater velocities the area of the heating zone is shown in fig 3a by considering the steam injection well as the center the area was divided into the upstream heating zone fig 3b and the downstream heating zone fig 3c the area of the upstream heating zone gradually decreased with the increase in groundwater flow rate while the downstream heating zone gradually increased with the increase in groundwater velocity owing to the effect of groundwater heat was transferred downstream resulting in an increase in the heating area downstream and a decrease in the heating area upstream however the area of the entire heating zone hardly varied with the increase in groundwater velocity and the average area affected by steam was 3747 cm thus the increase in groundwater velocity did not have a large impact on the area of the heating zone but resulted in shifting the location of the heating zone downstream the thermal influence diameter was calculated for different groundwater velocities the thermal influence diameter was found to have little difference at different flow rates of groundwater and the final average thermal influence diameter was approximately 79 6 cm the linear fit of the average thermal influence diameter for different groundwater velocities is shown in fig 4 the thermal influence diameter of the heating zone exhibited a good linear relationship with the steam injection time 3 2 influence steam flow rate on steam migration the temperature distributions at steam flow rates of 0 5 kg h 1 and 1 kg h 1 are shown in fig 5 the medium is coarse sand 1 and the groundwater velocity is 0 m d 1 because there was no groundwater velocity the temperature distribution was symmetrical under different steam flow rates an increase in the steam flow rate can increase the heat transfer speed and distance of the steam the area of the heating zone increased with an increase in the steam flow rate when the steam flow rate was 1 kg h 1 the heating zone was distributed throughout the simulation tank at 150 min as the steam flow increased the maximum temperature also increased when the steam flow rate was 0 5 kg h 1 the maximum temperature was approximately 60 c while when the steam flow rate was 1 kg h 1 the maximum temperature was approximately 85 c in coarse sand 1 when the steam injection flow rate was 0 5 kg h 1 the temperature distribution was h shaped and when the steam injection flow rate was 1 kg h 1 the temperature distribution became v shaped because the density of steam is less than that of water the transmission of steam is affected by buoyancy and it migrates upward as the steam injection flow rate increased the steam migrated faster in the vertical direction under the effect of pressure and buoyancy resulting in a v shaped temperature distribution notably the v shaped distribution prevented the steam from reaching the edge on both sides of the steam injection point which might lead to ineffective remediation the high temperature zone moved upward gradually with the increase in the steam injection time and then remained stable fig 6a when the steam flow rate was 0 5 kg h 1 the maximum upward shift of the high temperature zone was 28 7 cm and it did not increase after 120 min when the steam flow rate was 1 kg h 1 the maximum upward shift of the high temperature area was 38 8 cm and it started to stabilize after 90 min the area of the high temperature zone also increased gradually with the steam injection time fig 6b shows the area of the heating zone under different steam flow rates the area of the heating zone clearly increased with an increase in the steam flow rate when the steam flow rate was 1 kg h 1 150 min was required for the heating zone to cover the entire tank but when the steam flow was 0 5 kg h 1 270 min was required for the heating zone to cover the entire tank 3 3 influence of different media on steam migration in a homogeneous aquifer 3 3 1 temperature distribution across different media the influence of different media on the temperature distribution in the homogeneous aquifer at 150 min is shown in fig 7 the transmission shape of steam mainly depends on the ratio of buoyancy to viscous force that is the grashof number gr as shown in eq 1 van lookeren 1983 the larger the hydraulic conductivity of the medium the larger the gr and the more evident is the vertical migration of steam therefore under the same injected steam flow rate when the hydraulic conductivity of the medium was higher than 3 5 10 2 cm s 1 the heating zone had a v shaped distribution when the hydraulic conductivity decreased by 1 6 10 3 cm s 1 the heating zone was an h shaped distribution the greater the hydraulic conductivity of the medium the faster the vertical migration of steam and the more distinct the v type distribution of temperature therefore the shape of the heating zone was related to not only the steam injection rate but also the permeability of the aquifer medium when the hydraulic conductivity was lower than 1 6 10 3 cm s 1 the heating zone presented an h shaped distribution when the hydraulic conductivity was higher than 3 5 10 2 cm s 1 the distribution was v shaped at high steam injection flow rates and h shaped at low steam injection flow rates the gr can be calculated using the following equation 1 gr gβ l 3 δτ v 2 where l is the characteristic length m g is the gravitational acceleration m s 2 β is the fluid volume expansion coefficient δt is the temperature difference k and υ is the kinematic viscosity m2 s 1 across different media the temperatures at different distances from the steam injection point are shown in fig 8 which presented a gaussian distribution the temperature was the highest at the location closest to the steam injection point and gradually decreased with increasing distance from the steam injection well at the bottom row above the steam injection point the temperature values were in the order of fine sand medium sand coarse sand while at the top row the order of temperature values was the opposite as the hydraulic conductivity of the medium decreases the capillary force gradually increases the upward heat transfer is restrained and the condensate does not easily flow downward resulting in the accumulation of heat at the bottom therefore the temperature values in the upper layer of the simulation tank were in the order coarse sand medium sand fine sand while that for the lower layer was fine sand medium sand coarse sand 3 3 2 heating zone areas across different media the areas of the heating zone across different media are shown in fig 9 the physical properties of the medium have an impact on heat transfer among which the thermal conductivity of the medium has the largest impact o brien et al 2018 in this study the order of thermal conductivities and thermal convective heat transfer capacities of the medium was coarse sand medium sand fine sand however an abnormal phenomenon was observed in fine sand and the area of the heating zone in fine sand was larger than that in medium sand the steam migration process in porous media is similar to the heat pipe effect where the injected steam migrates upward and the condensed water migrates downward back to the steam zone udell 1985 capillary pressure plays a key role in phase change heat transfer systems in porous media in fine sand media owing to the high capillary pressure the condensate cannot easily return to the steam zone and the two phase zone becomes larger resulting in a larger area affected by steam udell 1983 moreover in fine sand and silt with low hydraulic conductivity capillary pressure plays a major role in enhancing the heat pipe effect and heat transfer capacity theurer et al 2004 zheng et al 2020 udell 1983 1985 found that the heat transfer in porous media increased by several orders of magnitude beyond pure conduction owing to evaporation convection and condensation phenomena similar to conventional heat pipe operation heat transfer in porous media also includes thermal dispersion jouybari et al 2020 in high permeability media heat transfer in steam mainly occurs through heat convection while in low permeability media heat convection is weakened and heat conduction and heat dispersion are enhanced fan and udell 1995 the heat transfer through thermal dispersion is related to the porosity of the porous medium afshari et al 2020 when the porosity was large the pore flow rate was small the heat exchange between the water and the medium was enhanced and the heat transfer was enhanced rau et al 2014 found that thermal dispersion in the vertical direction increased with a decrease in the particle size of quartz sand therefore owing to the effect of the heat pipe and thermal dispersion the area of the heating zone of the fine sand was larger than that of the medium sand the permeability difference between coarse sand and medium sand was low the hydraulic conductivities were high and the heat pipe and heat dispersion effects were not evident therefore the area of the heating zone for the medium sand was always smaller than that for the coarse sand hence the combined effect of thermal conductivity permeability and capillary force of the medium caused the heating zone area to be in the following order coarse sand 1 coarse sand 2 fine sand medium sand the heating zone area of different media was linearly fitted to the steam injection time t and the two had a good linear relationship table 3 3 4 influence of layered heterogeneous aquifers on steam migration 3 4 1 temperature distribution in layered heterogeneous aquifers the distribution of temperature in the layered heterogeneous aquifers are shown in fig 10 the medium used in the experimental setting shown in fig 10a was coarse sand in the lower layer and medium sand in the upper layer for the experiment in fig 10b the medium used was coarse sand in the lower layer and fine sand in the upper layer because of the large hydraulic conductivity of the lower layer medium and the small hydraulic conductivity of the upper layer medium a blocking interface was formed when the steam migrated upward leading to heat accumulation below the interface therefore this steam blocking interface prevented steam from entering the low permeability stratum resulting in poor remediation of heterogeneous aquifers because it was difficult for steam to enter the low permeability stratum the heat transfer of steam in the high permeability stratum mainly depended on thermal convection whereas that in the low permeability stratum mainly depended on heat conduction a comparison of fig 10a and b showed that with an increase in the permeability ratio of the upper layer to the lower layer the steam coverage was clearer and the temperature of the lower layer would be higher 3 4 2 heating zone area in the layered heterogeneous aquifer the area of the heating zone in the layered heterogeneous aquifer with different hydraulic conductivity ratios is shown in fig 11c as the hydraulic conductivity ratio r increased the area of the heating zone increased when r was large a large difference occurred in the hydraulic conductivities between the upper and lower layers leading to enhanced blocking accumulation of a large amount of heat at the interface and a rapid increase in the heating zone of the lower layer fig 11a the heat accumulated at the interface was transferred upward by heat conduction the heating area of the upper layer had a good linear relationship with the steam injection time fig 11b in layered heterogeneous aquifers the area of the lower layer heating zone increased and the temperature increased because of the blocking effect of the interface when r increased from 4 to 88 the area of the heating zone increased by 253 cm2 4 conclusion in this study the effects of different stratum structures steam flow rates and groundwater velocities on steam migration and temperature distribution were studied using a two dimensional sandbox experiment in homogeneous aquifers the experimental results showed that groundwater velocity did not affect the area of the heating zone but caused the steam to migrate downstream both the steam injection flow rate and the aquifer permeability affect the shape of the heating zone when the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer was lower than 1 6 10 3 cm s 1 the heating zone was h shaped and when the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer was higher than 3 5 10 2 cm s 1 the distribution was v shaped under high steam injection flow rate and h shaped under low steam injection flow rate the combined effect of thermal conductivity capillary force and permeability of the medium caused the area of the heating zone to be in the order of coarse sand 1 coarse sand 2 fine sand medium sand in layered heterogeneous aquifers a steam blocking interface was formed between the low and high permeability strata which blocked steam migration and caused steam to accumulate at the interface when r increased from 4 to 88 the area of the heating zone increased by 253 cm2 the experimental results can not only help determine the well spacing and steam affected area but also help clarify the mechanism of steam migration and heat transfer and provide a basis for further improving the application of steam in

1342,steam injection technology is commonly used to rapidly remove volatile and semi volatile organic pollutants in aquifers and its remediation effect is highly related to steam migration and temperature distribution however systematic studies on steam migration and temperature distribution across different types of aquifers are lacking in this study the steam migration and temperature distribution in an aquifer were investigated through a series of two dimensional sandbox experiments with different groundwater velocities steam injection flow rates and stratigraphic structures the experimental results indicated that the temperature distribution in the aquifer was related to the formation permeability and steam injection flow rate when the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer was lower than 10 3 cm s 1 the heating zone in the aquifer had an h shaped distribution and when it was higher than 10 2 cm s 1 the heating zone had a v shaped distribution for a high steam injection flow rate 1 kgh 1 and an h shaped distribution for a low injection flow rate 0 5 kgh 1 under the same injection steam flow rate the total area of the heating zone in the aquifers with different media was in the following order of sand particle size coarse sand fine sand medium sand owing to the heat pipe and heat dispersion effects the heating zone area in the fine sand aquifer was larger than that of the medium sand aquifer groundwater velocity did not affect the area of the heating zone with the increase in groundwater velocity the heating zone expanded downstream in layered heterogeneous aquifers the upper fine and lower coarse structures formed a steam blocking interface resulting in steam accumulation and temperature increase in the lower layer these findings are significant for improving our understanding of steam migration and temperature distribution in aquifers leading to an improved design and prediction of the steam remediation required for mitigating aquifer pollution keywords steam injection technology v shaped distribution heat pipe effect steam migration heating zone area aquifer 1 introduction in situ thermal remediation istr is a method of heating the contaminated area in situ to considerably increase the temperature of soil and groundwater thereby accelerating the volatilization of organic pollutants in the contaminated zone heron et al 2016 sun et al 2018d early and udell 2000 it can remove non aqueous phase liquid napl pollutants faster and more thoroughly triplett kingston et al 2010 sun et al 2018b udell 1998 istr mainly includes steam injection thermal conductivity heating and electrical resistance heating triplett kingston et al 2010 sun et al 2018a thermal conductivity heating is suitable for most hydrogeological conditions and can heat soil to higher than 500 c however this method is expensive electrical resistance heating generates heat by applying an electric current to the subsurface baker et al 2008 it is particularly suitable for treating low permeability strata electricity is mainly conducted through the water in soil pores and water or other solvents must be added to the strata during application hassanzadeh and harding 2016 sadeghi et al 2017 therefore this technology is often used in combination with steam injection heron et al 2005 udell 2000 steam injection is most effective when steam can enter the soil pores and is cheaper than other thermal techniques sun et al 2017 sun et al 2018e the removal of pollutants using steam injection technology is highly related to steam migration and temperature distribution however systematic research under different groundwater flow rates steam injection flows and formation structures remains lacking present research on steam migration is mainly theoretical and experimental ochs et al 2010 studied steam migration at high and low steam injection rates and found that at high steam injection rates the temperature distribution changed from radial diffusion at an early stage to ovoid at a later stage moreover the low injection rate resulted in a stronger vertical transmission owing to buoyancy by comparing the experimental results with the numerical simulation results the authors confirmed the applicability of the model as well as its limitations in simulating steam migration in addition this study did not consider the influence of groundwater velocity when investigating steam migration other studies have used models to simulate steam migration and transport of pollutants in aquifers nilsson et al 2011 pophillat et al 2018 the simulation results showed that the vertical permeability of the medium has a significant influence on the distribution of the water temperature when the vertical permeability is high the steam easily migrates upward resulting in a rapid increase in the aquifer temperature tse et al 2006 sun et al 2018c moreover in a high permeability medium heat convection is dominant fan and udell 1995 nilsson et al 2011 according to van lookeren 1983 the steam migration in aquifers is affected by buoyancy and the interaction between buoyancy and the viscous force generated by steam injection causes the radial propagation of steam the simulation also revealed that the shape of pollutant distribution was consistent with that of steam which transported the pollutants upward or horizontally tse et al 2006 schmidt et al 2002 at present most studies related to steam migration are simulation research however a gap remains between simulation and experimental research the experimental results can not only verify the simulation results but also reflect the mechanism of steam migration more accurately and intuitively therefore steam migration must be investigated experimentally under different permeability media groundwater velocities and steam injection flow rates heat transfer mainly depends on heat conduction and convection in aquifers sleep and mcclure 2001 the steam distribution mainly occurred by convection through the porous medium until it reached the region of condensation and subsequently heat was transferred to the cooler region butler 1991 davis 1997 al yousef et al 2014 the heat convection is weakened and the heat conduction and dispersion are enhanced in the low permeability zone pophillat et al 2020 therefore steam injection is limited by stratum permeability which in turn has a significant influence on steam migration basel and udell 1991 kramer 2014 kumar and hassanzadeh 2021b a simulation study by kumar and hassanzadeh 2021a found that the heterogeneity of shale during steam assisted gravity drainage can affect oil recovery which not only reduces oil drainage but also causes further heat loss peng et al 2013 studied the removal of trichloroethylene from heterogeneous soil in a two dimensional simulation tank their study found that the heat transfer of hot steam in the low permeability lens was stabilized and the removal efficiency of trichloroethylene decreased they mainly studied the removal efficiency of pollutants but did not extensively analyze the main mechanism for the decrease in pollutant removal efficiency therefore steam migration and temperature distribution in heterogeneous aquifers must be studied moreover most studies on heterogeneous aquifers have mainly focused on the pollutant removal rate but the steam migration mechanism has not been adequately explored the area of influence and temperature distribution of steam in aquifers play an important role in the design of steam injection wells and the prediction of pollutant removal therefore relevant research is necessary in summary the efficiency of the steam injection process depends mainly on steam migration and temperature distribution in this study a two dimensional simulation flume was used to investigate the effects of groundwater velocity steam flow rate and medium permeability on steam migration and temperature distribution the objectives of this study were to 1 quantitatively characterize the effect of groundwater velocity on the area of the heating zone and the thermally affected diameter 2 investigate the influence of steam flow rate on steam migration and temperature distribution 3 quantitatively analyze the influence of different permeability media on steam migration temperature distribution and steam affected area and 4 investigate the migration and distribution of steam in layered heterogeneous aquifers 2 materials and methods 2 1 influence of different groundwater velocities on steam migration to clarify the effect of groundwater velocity on steam migration an experiment was conducted in a large two dimensional simulation tank fig 1a with the following dimensions 110 cm length 50 cm height 8 cm width in each tank quartz sand mixed with fine sand was used as the main packing medium the physical properties of the quartz sand samples used in the tests are listed in table 1 a steam injection well was inserted into the tank with a few small holes at its base the steam injection well was positioned 54 5 cm from the left side of the tank and 50 4 cm from the right side the small holes were covered with gauze to prevent sand from entering the injection well fig 1 shows a schematic diagram of the experimental setup there were 60 sampling ports 10 columns 6 rows at the front of the tank to monitor the temperature using a multi channel temperature patrol instrument shen zhen hua xin measuring instrument company shen zhen china before the experiment tap water was continuously injected at a rate of 0 2 m d 1 by a peristaltic pump to ensure uniformity of the porous media and prevent the presence of entrapped air the inlet of the tank was set at the lower right and the outlet was set at the upper left a 3 kw steam generator norbest machinery manufacturing co ltd wuhan china was supplied by a constant flux of water to generate steam at a constant rate of 1 kg h 1 the steam generator produced saturated steam at a temperature of 120 c and a pressure of 200 kpa the temperatures were continuously measured in the sandbox in this study darcy s law was used to determine groundwater velocity groundwater flow rates were selected as 0 0 1 0 5 and 0 9 m d 1 respectively 2 2 influence of different media and steam flow rates on steam migration this experiment was conducted in a 60 cm length 50 cm height 4 cm width two dimensional simulation tank fig 2b the injection well installed at the bottom center of the tank for stem injection contained a cylinder diameter 4 cm height 7 5 cm and many tiny pores at the top the tiny pores were covered with gauze to prevent sand from entering the injection well there were 24 sampling ports at the front of the tank to monitor the temperature using a multi channel temperature patrol instrument shen zhen hua xin measuring instrument company shen zhen china for the experiment on the influence of different aquifer types on steam migration coarse sand 1 coarse sand 2 medium sand and fine sand were selected as the aquifer media the physical properties of the quartz sand samples used in the tests are listed in table 1 the steam flow rate was selected as 1 kg h 1 and the groundwater velocity was 0 m d 1 to determine the influence of steam flow on heat transfer the injection flow rates were set to 0 5 kg h 1 and 1 kg h 1 the medium of the aquifer was coarse sand 1 and the velocity of groundwater was 0 m d 1 other pre experiment operations were the same as those described previously 2 3 influence of layered heterogeneity on steam migration the experimental device of the layered heterogeneity experiment was the same as that used in the previous experiment described in section 2 2 the filling method is shown in fig 1c and the filling medium for each experiment is shown in table 2 the steam flow rate was set to 1 kg h 1 and the groundwater velocity was 0 m d 1 the other steps in the experiment were the same as those described previously 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of groundwater velocity on steam migration 3 1 1 temperature distribution under different groundwater velocities the temperature distribution at different groundwater velocities when hot steam was injected for 7 h is shown in fig 2 when the groundwater velocity is 0 m d 1 that is in the absence of groundwater velocity the temperature field exhibited a symmetrical distribution however with the increase in groundwater velocity the heating zone expanded downstream the heat transfer of hot steam mainly depends on heat conduction and convection in which heat convection plays a major role when the groundwater velocity was 0 m d 1 the heat transfer mainly depended on the heat convection generated by the steam migration thus the temperature was symmetrically distributed in the presence of groundwater velocity the steam and condensation front migrated downstream owing to the hydrodynamic effect and convection heat transfer occurred in the groundwater leading to the expansion of the heating zone downstream 3 1 2 thermal influence diameter and area of heating zone under different groundwater velocities the area of the heating zone is shown in fig 3a by considering the steam injection well as the center the area was divided into the upstream heating zone fig 3b and the downstream heating zone fig 3c the area of the upstream heating zone gradually decreased with the increase in groundwater flow rate while the downstream heating zone gradually increased with the increase in groundwater velocity owing to the effect of groundwater heat was transferred downstream resulting in an increase in the heating area downstream and a decrease in the heating area upstream however the area of the entire heating zone hardly varied with the increase in groundwater velocity and the average area affected by steam was 3747 cm thus the increase in groundwater velocity did not have a large impact on the area of the heating zone but resulted in shifting the location of the heating zone downstream the thermal influence diameter was calculated for different groundwater velocities the thermal influence diameter was found to have little difference at different flow rates of groundwater and the final average thermal influence diameter was approximately 79 6 cm the linear fit of the average thermal influence diameter for different groundwater velocities is shown in fig 4 the thermal influence diameter of the heating zone exhibited a good linear relationship with the steam injection time 3 2 influence steam flow rate on steam migration the temperature distributions at steam flow rates of 0 5 kg h 1 and 1 kg h 1 are shown in fig 5 the medium is coarse sand 1 and the groundwater velocity is 0 m d 1 because there was no groundwater velocity the temperature distribution was symmetrical under different steam flow rates an increase in the steam flow rate can increase the heat transfer speed and distance of the steam the area of the heating zone increased with an increase in the steam flow rate when the steam flow rate was 1 kg h 1 the heating zone was distributed throughout the simulation tank at 150 min as the steam flow increased the maximum temperature also increased when the steam flow rate was 0 5 kg h 1 the maximum temperature was approximately 60 c while when the steam flow rate was 1 kg h 1 the maximum temperature was approximately 85 c in coarse sand 1 when the steam injection flow rate was 0 5 kg h 1 the temperature distribution was h shaped and when the steam injection flow rate was 1 kg h 1 the temperature distribution became v shaped because the density of steam is less than that of water the transmission of steam is affected by buoyancy and it migrates upward as the steam injection flow rate increased the steam migrated faster in the vertical direction under the effect of pressure and buoyancy resulting in a v shaped temperature distribution notably the v shaped distribution prevented the steam from reaching the edge on both sides of the steam injection point which might lead to ineffective remediation the high temperature zone moved upward gradually with the increase in the steam injection time and then remained stable fig 6a when the steam flow rate was 0 5 kg h 1 the maximum upward shift of the high temperature zone was 28 7 cm and it did not increase after 120 min when the steam flow rate was 1 kg h 1 the maximum upward shift of the high temperature area was 38 8 cm and it started to stabilize after 90 min the area of the high temperature zone also increased gradually with the steam injection time fig 6b shows the area of the heating zone under different steam flow rates the area of the heating zone clearly increased with an increase in the steam flow rate when the steam flow rate was 1 kg h 1 150 min was required for the heating zone to cover the entire tank but when the steam flow was 0 5 kg h 1 270 min was required for the heating zone to cover the entire tank 3 3 influence of different media on steam migration in a homogeneous aquifer 3 3 1 temperature distribution across different media the influence of different media on the temperature distribution in the homogeneous aquifer at 150 min is shown in fig 7 the transmission shape of steam mainly depends on the ratio of buoyancy to viscous force that is the grashof number gr as shown in eq 1 van lookeren 1983 the larger the hydraulic conductivity of the medium the larger the gr and the more evident is the vertical migration of steam therefore under the same injected steam flow rate when the hydraulic conductivity of the medium was higher than 3 5 10 2 cm s 1 the heating zone had a v shaped distribution when the hydraulic conductivity decreased by 1 6 10 3 cm s 1 the heating zone was an h shaped distribution the greater the hydraulic conductivity of the medium the faster the vertical migration of steam and the more distinct the v type distribution of temperature therefore the shape of the heating zone was related to not only the steam injection rate but also the permeability of the aquifer medium when the hydraulic conductivity was lower than 1 6 10 3 cm s 1 the heating zone presented an h shaped distribution when the hydraulic conductivity was higher than 3 5 10 2 cm s 1 the distribution was v shaped at high steam injection flow rates and h shaped at low steam injection flow rates the gr can be calculated using the following equation 1 gr gβ l 3 δτ v 2 where l is the characteristic length m g is the gravitational acceleration m s 2 β is the fluid volume expansion coefficient δt is the temperature difference k and υ is the kinematic viscosity m2 s 1 across different media the temperatures at different distances from the steam injection point are shown in fig 8 which presented a gaussian distribution the temperature was the highest at the location closest to the steam injection point and gradually decreased with increasing distance from the steam injection well at the bottom row above the steam injection point the temperature values were in the order of fine sand medium sand coarse sand while at the top row the order of temperature values was the opposite as the hydraulic conductivity of the medium decreases the capillary force gradually increases the upward heat transfer is restrained and the condensate does not easily flow downward resulting in the accumulation of heat at the bottom therefore the temperature values in the upper layer of the simulation tank were in the order coarse sand medium sand fine sand while that for the lower layer was fine sand medium sand coarse sand 3 3 2 heating zone areas across different media the areas of the heating zone across different media are shown in fig 9 the physical properties of the medium have an impact on heat transfer among which the thermal conductivity of the medium has the largest impact o brien et al 2018 in this study the order of thermal conductivities and thermal convective heat transfer capacities of the medium was coarse sand medium sand fine sand however an abnormal phenomenon was observed in fine sand and the area of the heating zone in fine sand was larger than that in medium sand the steam migration process in porous media is similar to the heat pipe effect where the injected steam migrates upward and the condensed water migrates downward back to the steam zone udell 1985 capillary pressure plays a key role in phase change heat transfer systems in porous media in fine sand media owing to the high capillary pressure the condensate cannot easily return to the steam zone and the two phase zone becomes larger resulting in a larger area affected by steam udell 1983 moreover in fine sand and silt with low hydraulic conductivity capillary pressure plays a major role in enhancing the heat pipe effect and heat transfer capacity theurer et al 2004 zheng et al 2020 udell 1983 1985 found that the heat transfer in porous media increased by several orders of magnitude beyond pure conduction owing to evaporation convection and condensation phenomena similar to conventional heat pipe operation heat transfer in porous media also includes thermal dispersion jouybari et al 2020 in high permeability media heat transfer in steam mainly occurs through heat convection while in low permeability media heat convection is weakened and heat conduction and heat dispersion are enhanced fan and udell 1995 the heat transfer through thermal dispersion is related to the porosity of the porous medium afshari et al 2020 when the porosity was large the pore flow rate was small the heat exchange between the water and the medium was enhanced and the heat transfer was enhanced rau et al 2014 found that thermal dispersion in the vertical direction increased with a decrease in the particle size of quartz sand therefore owing to the effect of the heat pipe and thermal dispersion the area of the heating zone of the fine sand was larger than that of the medium sand the permeability difference between coarse sand and medium sand was low the hydraulic conductivities were high and the heat pipe and heat dispersion effects were not evident therefore the area of the heating zone for the medium sand was always smaller than that for the coarse sand hence the combined effect of thermal conductivity permeability and capillary force of the medium caused the heating zone area to be in the following order coarse sand 1 coarse sand 2 fine sand medium sand the heating zone area of different media was linearly fitted to the steam injection time t and the two had a good linear relationship table 3 3 4 influence of layered heterogeneous aquifers on steam migration 3 4 1 temperature distribution in layered heterogeneous aquifers the distribution of temperature in the layered heterogeneous aquifers are shown in fig 10 the medium used in the experimental setting shown in fig 10a was coarse sand in the lower layer and medium sand in the upper layer for the experiment in fig 10b the medium used was coarse sand in the lower layer and fine sand in the upper layer because of the large hydraulic conductivity of the lower layer medium and the small hydraulic conductivity of the upper layer medium a blocking interface was formed when the steam migrated upward leading to heat accumulation below the interface therefore this steam blocking interface prevented steam from entering the low permeability stratum resulting in poor remediation of heterogeneous aquifers because it was difficult for steam to enter the low permeability stratum the heat transfer of steam in the high permeability stratum mainly depended on thermal convection whereas that in the low permeability stratum mainly depended on heat conduction a comparison of fig 10a and b showed that with an increase in the permeability ratio of the upper layer to the lower layer the steam coverage was clearer and the temperature of the lower layer would be higher 3 4 2 heating zone area in the layered heterogeneous aquifer the area of the heating zone in the layered heterogeneous aquifer with different hydraulic conductivity ratios is shown in fig 11c as the hydraulic conductivity ratio r increased the area of the heating zone increased when r was large a large difference occurred in the hydraulic conductivities between the upper and lower layers leading to enhanced blocking accumulation of a large amount of heat at the interface and a rapid increase in the heating zone of the lower layer fig 11a the heat accumulated at the interface was transferred upward by heat conduction the heating area of the upper layer had a good linear relationship with the steam injection time fig 11b in layered heterogeneous aquifers the area of the lower layer heating zone increased and the temperature increased because of the blocking effect of the interface when r increased from 4 to 88 the area of the heating zone increased by 253 cm2 4 conclusion in this study the effects of different stratum structures steam flow rates and groundwater velocities on steam migration and temperature distribution were studied using a two dimensional sandbox experiment in homogeneous aquifers the experimental results showed that groundwater velocity did not affect the area of the heating zone but caused the steam to migrate downstream both the steam injection flow rate and the aquifer permeability affect the shape of the heating zone when the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer was lower than 1 6 10 3 cm s 1 the heating zone was h shaped and when the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer was higher than 3 5 10 2 cm s 1 the distribution was v shaped under high steam injection flow rate and h shaped under low steam injection flow rate the combined effect of thermal conductivity capillary force and permeability of the medium caused the area of the heating zone to be in the order of coarse sand 1 coarse sand 2 fine sand medium sand in layered heterogeneous aquifers a steam blocking interface was formed between the low and high permeability strata which blocked steam migration and caused steam to accumulate at the interface when r increased from 4 to 88 the area of the heating zone increased by 253 cm2 the experimental results can not only help determine the well spacing and steam affected area but also help clarify the mechanism of steam migration and heat transfer and provide a basis for further improving the application of steam in

hazardous to humans and the environment in this study activity concentrations of uranium isotopes were analyzed in 15 groundwater samples taken from 15 bored wells in thu duc district ho chi minh city

activity concentrations of uranium isotopes and their daughter radionuclides in groundwater were determined in some regions nguyen et al 2011 le et al 2015 nguyen et al 2020a some samples of

evaporation co precipitation and electrodeposition creates a thin flat sample that is adaptable to the measurement with the alpha spectroscopy mola et al 2013 astm 2012 in this study we introduced a new method for extraction uranium from groundwater using the p100 gel column in which the dilute hno3 with various concentrations was used for extraction and striping phases the uranium samples were then prepared by the electrodeposition method astm 2012 because the contamination of uranium isotopes in groundwater are potentially hazardous to human health and the environment they must be reduced

many studies were focusing on the accumulation of u in agricultural soils schnug and haneklaus 2015 schipper et al 2011 taylor 2007 pearson et al 2019 bigalke et al 2017 however few studies found that irrigation water was the primary source that contributes natural radionuclides to the agricultural soils and long term irrigation with groundwater caused an accumulation of natural radionuclides in

uptake and water leaching were considered as the main processes that contributed to the decreasing rate of u in the topsoil besides that fertilization and irrigation are two main processes that contributed to the increasing rate of u in the topsoil the leaching rate of u from the topsoil was assessed by multi models the activity concentrations of uranium isotopes in the topsoil were predicted by the method that was introduced in our previous studies nguyen et al 2020a nguyen et al 2020b nguyen et al 2021 contamination of natural radionuclides in agricultural soils causes potential health risks to the population by its radiation effects although the activity concentrations of radionuclides in the topsoils have been widely investigated the potential links between their activities in the topsoil and other parts of the agricultural ecosystem such as irrigation water and fertilizers remain unclear moreover how agricultural cultivations change their activities in

water sources that supply water for human activities and agricultural irrigation systems besides that groundwater is used popularly in some regions of the city many studies found significant degrees of pollution due to heavy metals and radioactive materials in groundwater in ho chi minh city le et al 2015 tran 2019 therefore it is necessary to find effective methods to remove the pollutants from

ph values of the groundwater samples are presented in table 1 uranium isotopes were analyzed by the alpha spectroscopy canberra equipped with passivated implanted planar silicon detectors pips fig 2 the recent system includes two a1200 37 am detectors which have an active area of 1200 mm2 dead layer thickness 140 μm and leakage current about 12 na at 20 c the energy resolution at 5638 kev of 241am was lower than 20 kev fwhm with a detector to source spacing equal to the detector diameter the efficiency of spectroscopy depends on the distance between the detector and the sample based on the calibrations with a 241am point source the efficiency of 25 is achievable with the close detector to source spacing 5 mm the gap between sample and detector can be adjust form 4 mm to 40 mm 4 mm per a step the background of the measurement chamber was lower than one count per hour the lower limit of detection for 24 h of counting time was 0 12 mbq l 1 for alpha emitter radionuclides in water samples genie 2000 is a comprehensive set of capabilities for acquiring and analyzing spectra from multichannel analyzers mcas its functions include mca control spectral display and manipulation basic spectrum analysis and reporting fig 3 shows the alpha spectrum of sample 3 which was measured for 24 h by the spectroscopy because of the low background radiation in the measurement chamber and the uranium separation procedure the energy peaks of 234u and 238u were displayed clearly in the spectrum fig 4 explains the method for sample preparation to measure uranium activity in a groundwater sample the procedure can be divided into two main steps 1 uranium extraction and 2 uranium deposition fig 4a describes the p100 column 12 8 mm for uranium extraction the tube contains about 2 g of p100 resin washed two times with dilute nitric acid the sample solution hno3 ph 2 has flowed through the column the flow rate was about 1 ml min 1 the uranium was then removed from the resin by 2 m hno3 the final solution 2 m hno3 was evaporated to dryness and the residue was kept for the next step fig 4b describes the method to prepare the uranium samples that are suitable for analysis with alpha spectroscopy the uranium fraction obtained after separation was reconstituted by adding 1 ml of hno3 10 and 10 ml of nh4 2so4 0 23 m this solution was heated and its ph was adjusted until the change of indicator was a yellow color by the addition of concentrated nh4oh drop by drop the solution was then transferred to an electrodeposition cell and put into the electrodeposition system fig 4b the process that uranium deposited on the sample disk had taken place for 60 min under a current density of 0 5 a cm 1 the stainless steel disks were about 20 mm in diameter the anode was a polished platinum spiral wire following the deposition the disk was dried in the furnace at 400 c for 5 min and then counted for 24 h by the alpha spectroscopy to determine the activity of uranium isotopes to find out the chemical yield of the procedure that performed the determination of uranium isotopes the following experiment was carried out five water samples were spiked with the tracers 0 22 0 01 bq each sample and prepared with the above procedure the results of the experiments showed that the efficiency values of u absorption on the p100 column were from 91 40 6 11 to 99 36 0 17 with the mean value of 96 72 2 57 the efficiency values of u striping from the p100 column were from 84 76 9 01 to 93 39 10 74 with the mean value of 90 67 4 77 the efficiency values of u electrodeposition were from 62 73 5 39 to 96 74 7 20 with the mean value of 91 82 6 23 totally the chemical yield based on the sampling procedure for the standard solution was 80 52 7 30 2 3 dose assessment according to unscear 2006 the annual effective dose due to drinking water was calculated by eq 1 1 d e i a dcf u where de is the annual effective dose due to drinking of groundwater samples μsv y 1 i is the consumption intake rate of groundwater 730 l y 1 a is the activity concentration of u isotope in the water samples bq l 1 and dcfu is the dose conversion factor of the u isotope according to icrp 2012 according to the icrp report the dcfu values are 7 6 10 9 and 8 3 10 9 sv bq 1 for 238u and 234u respectively the annual intake rate of 730 l y 1 was based on many studies galán lópez et al 2004 somlai et al 2007 todorovic et al 2012 2 4 long term change of u activity in the topsoil due to agricultural irrigation 2 4 1 proposed model the proposed model used to predict the long term change of u activity in the topsoil was described by fig 5 due to various processes the activity concentrations of u isotopes in the topsoil can increase or decrease in this study the activity concentration of the u isotope in the topsoil was expressed by the formula as eq 2 nguyen et al 2020a nguyen et al 2020b nguyen et al 2021 2 c a b l l l u 1 e l l l u t c 0 e l l l u t where c bq kg 1 is the activity concentration of u isotope in the topsoil at the time of t days c0 bq kg 1 is the activity concentration of u isotope which is available in the topsoil at the beginning a bq d 1 is the daily input of u isotope due to water irrigation b bq d 1 is the daily input of u isotope due to fertilization ll and lu are the partitions of the u isotope lost by processes of water leaching and plant uptake respectively other minor factors such as radioactive decay volatilization soil erosion excavation drainage radioactive deposition and earthworms that contribute to the total change rate of u isotope in the topsoil were excluded from the models because they were negligible 2 4 2 data collection the investigated field was located in the study area in this field water spinach ipomoea aquatica forssk is cultivated three seasons per year it is harvested three times during the duration of crop for long term estimation we assumed that the same irrigation and fertilization practices had been applied to the field according to the current agricultural practices in the investigated area the average irrigation rate was observed about 200 m3 ha 1 d 1 normally if it is not raining the irrigation is scheduled twice a day some chemical fertilizers had been applied to the site to improve crop yields the average application rates were about 250 350 30 kg ha 1 season 1 for npk 20 20 15 npk super phosphate p and kcl k respectively the activity concentrations of u isotopes in fertilizers applied for the investigated field were presented by truong et al 2018 according to this study the activity concentration of 238u were 62 2 46 5 and 1 3 bq kg 1 found in npk p and k fertilizers respectively the activity concentration of u was analyzed in soil and water spinach by the previous study they were 31 2 bq kg 1 and 10 5 bq kg 1 in soil and water spinach respectively the soil to water spinach transfer factors of u were 0 34 bui et al 2020 the soil properties used for model assessments such as water organic matter mineral matter air clay sand silt etc are present in table 1 soil water content is the mass of water in the soil measured as the difference between the moist soil and the soil dried at 105 c soil air content is the ratio of the volume of air to the volume of voids air content and water content are mostly represented in percentage in table 1 the solid liquid organic carbon water and mineral matter water partition coefficients were based on the iaea technical report iaea 2010 2 4 3 estimation of the leaching rate of u in this study the fates of 238u and 234u in the soil layer based on modelling were similar the leaching rate of u both 234u and 238u was predicted by the cemc soil model hydrus 1d model and the de meeus model the methods for the prediction of u leaching rate using the cemc soil model and the hydrus 1d model were discussed in detail in our previous nguyen et al 2020b the leaching rate of u from the topsoil based on the de meeus model was discussed in the publications de meeus et al 2002 and qian et al 2018 according to the publications the leaching rate of u dl was calculated by eq 3 3 d l 1000 f k d d p ρ where dp is the depth of plough layer m ρ is the soil bulk density kg m 3 kd is solid liquid partition coefficient l kg 1 and f is the annual precipitation excess m y 1 the annual precipitation excess f is given by the product of the rate of precipitation p m y 1 and the fraction of water that infiltrates the soil de meeûs et al 2002 4 f p f inf where f is the fraction of water that infiltrates the soil for the soil collected from the field the f value was 0 2 for three model the fate of uranium in the topsoil layer 20 cm was simulated the 20 cm of air layer was applied for the top boundary the lower boundary conditions will have a huge impact on predictions of water movement in any hydrological model for three models free drainage boundary was used for the lower boundary such a situation often occurs in field studies of water flow and drainage in the vadose zone this lower boundary condition is most appropriate for situation where the water table lies far below the domain of interest 2 5 uranium removal using k2feo4 absorbent u contaminated in groundwater samples was absorbed by the potassium ferrate k2feo4 the method is summarised in fig 6 principally the removal mechanisms of u including of adsorption co precipitate and surface complexation were revealed in other works he et al 2017 prucek et al 2015 kim et al 2015 firstly the compound of kno3 and fe powders 1 1 was heated to a liquid solution the solution was then cooled at room temperature to produce k2feo4 the bulk of k2feo4 was crushed to powders and they were filtered by the 0 2 mm sieve at the laboratory a groundwater sample 500 ml was reduced to 10 ml by heating on the sand bath the solution was then transferred to the centrifugation tube a volume of 1 ml k2feo4 powders was added to the solution the final solution was shocked in 15 min and then waited for 2 h before the centrifugation all tubes were placed into a centrifuge and they were centrifuged in 40 min at the speed of 2500 rev min finally the residue of k2feo4 which u was absorbed on was removed from the solution the activity concentrations of u isotopes before and after the u removal procedure were analyzed by the alpha spectrometer with the design introduced in section 2 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 activity concentrations of 234u and 238u table 2 summarizes the main measurement results on 15 groundwater samples that were collected in the study area the activity concentration of 238u was varied from 13 5 to 268 mbq l 1 with a mean value of 61 2 mbq l 1 the activity concentration of 234u was varied from 20 2 to 438 mbq l 1 with a mean value of 97 1 mbq l 1 they are lower than the maximum contaminant level for uranium recommended by the world health organization is 30 μgu l 1 about 370 mbq l 1238u who 2011 many studies were measuring the 234u and 238u concentrations in groundwater in the world most of the results showed that the activity concentrations of u isotopes in groundwater were higher than those in other water types such as rainwater surface water seawater tap water etc byong and chang 2019 ahmad et al 2020 ahmed 2018 sharma et al 2019 in groundwater in saudi arabia the average activity concentrations of 234u and 238u were 180 9 and 119 9 mbq l 1 respectively el sharkawy 2018 uranium concentrations a total of 82 samples in groundwater in icheon middle korea showed a wide range from 0 02 to 1640 μg l 1 with a mean of 56 77 μg l 1 most groundwater samples had relatively low concentrations 32 9 were below 1 μg l 1 while 15 9 exceeded 30 μg l 1 byong and chang 2019 ahmad et al 2020 found that the average level of 238u in groundwater in jordan was 33 mbq l 1 the concentration of u in groundwater in punjab india was found from 3 to 8 6 bq l 1 sharma et al 2019 as our study most of the studies in the world presented the u concentration in groundwater below the permissible limit of 30 μg l 1 recommended by world health organization who 2011 however in some particular areas such as uranium mines the concentration of u was found at a high level mathuthu et al 2020 hinck et al 2021 high uranium concentrations occur in groundwater around the world with values exceeding 2000 μg l in bedrock aquifers in norway reimann et al 2005 in namibia mathuthu et al 2020 found that the total activity of u in the groundwater around the uranium mine was 233 41 bq l 1 post et al 2017 presented the results of a study from burundi where dissolved uranium concentrations can exceed 700 μg l 1 the ratios of 234u 238u in the investigated groundwater samples ranged from 1 12 to 2 with an average value of 1 44 previous studies presented that the ratio depended on the mineralogical composition of the aquifer matrix and by the geochemical hydrochemical conditions of the sample site el sharkawy 2018 many investigations showed the 234u 238u ratio higher than 1 the uranium activity ratios 234u 238u in groundwater samples investigated in saudi arabia had an average value of 1 38 and ranged from 1 0 to 2 17 el sharkawy 2018 groundwater contains 234u isotopes with activities exceeding that of 238u due to the recoil of 234th and preferential leaching of 234u compared to 238u cherdyntsev 1955 rosholt et al 1963 kigoshi 1971 the rocks of aquifers partly lose intermediate u decay products due to the α recoil when the 238u atom decay is accompanied by the α particle ejection while the produced recoil 234th atom is ejected in the opposite direction if the decay occurs near the rock liquid interface this atom enters water to be rapidly transformed into 234u owing to this process the ratio between the 234u and 238u activities decreases in the rock as compared with their equilibrium value and groundwater to be enriched with excessive 234u isotope in some coastal regions it was found that the relationship between the 234u 238u ratios in groundwater and seawater from the discharge zone in a coastal area of spain rodrigo et al 2014 found the 234u 238u ratios from 1 135 to 1 336 with an average value of 1 15 few studies showed the 234u 238u ratio is lower than 1 mathuthu et al 2020 found the ratio of 234u 238u was 5 52 10 05 the ratio below 1 indicates the presence of freshly extracted uranium rhodes et al 2006 von oertzen 2014 whereas a ratio exceeding 1 indicates the origin as natural sediments in groundwater 3 2 health risks assessment based on the recommendations of the world health organization who 2011 the provisional guideline 238u content is 0 030 mg l 1 chemical aspects which corresponds to an alpha activity of approximately 0 4 bq l 1 however groundwater also contains 234u isotopes with activities exceeding that of 238u due to the recoil of 234th and preferential leaching of 234u compared to 238u the 234u 238u activity ratio can reach 10 and more and the gross alpha activity increases by the same factor moreover there are other radionuclides such as 210pо 210pb 226ra and 232th contributed to the gross alpha activity in groundwater the screening levels for drinking water below which no further action is required are 0 5 bq l 1 for gross alpha activity therefore with high u activity some samples such as samples 5 and 7 should be performed a further analysis to assess properly to assess the health risks due to drinking groundwater to the local population the annual effective dose de was estimated as eq 1 the annual effective dose due to intaking food crops irrigated with groundwater was insignificant and not considered in this study nguyen et al 2019 the results of the de are presented in table 2 de ranged from 0 198 to 4 141 μsv y 1 with an average value of 0 928 μsv y 1 the results showed that all values of de were much lower than the recommended dose due to drinking water and ingestion of food 300 μsv y 1 unscear 2008 who 2011 however this values are not sufficient to assess the radiological risk due to drinking water because other radionuclides that contribute to the effective dose must be taken into account 3 3 long term accumulation of u in the agricultural soil 3 3 1 daily input rates due to agricultural practices fig 7a shows the daily input rates of u estimated for the water spinach soil in the study area the application of inorganic fertilizers which contain various levels of 238u and 234u caused a significant increase of u in the soil as a result of fertilization practices discussed in section 2 4 2 the input rate of u is 0 079 bq m 2 d 1 was estimated for water spinach soil some studies estimated the accumulation of u in agricultural soils due to various fertilization practices schipper et al 2011 had observed the accumulation rate of u in the new zealand pastoral soils due to the application of superphosphate fertilizer in this long term study considering superphosphate application over 23 years an annual application of fertilizer at 50 kg p ha 1 y 1 was estimated to result in a yearly rate of accumulation of 0 042 mg u kg 1 0 52 bq 238u kg 1 y 1 similarly in an earlier study of four new zealand soils the annual uranium accumulation rates were reported as ranging between 0 015 0 047 mg kg 1 0 19 0 58 bq 238u kg 1 y 1 taylor 2007 in comparison with schipper et al 2011 and taylor s 2007 studies our u input rate lower than their results the main reason is the high u concentration found in fertilizers in their studies due to the current irrigation system with groundwater samples the input rates of u in the water spinach soil are shown in fig 7a the rates are from 0 539 to 10 445 bq m 2 d 1 with an average value of 2 343 bq m 2 d 1 we found that the irrigation practices contributed the most significant fractions to the total increasing rates of radionuclides in the investigated soil some studies indicated that irrigation was the most critical factor that potentially influenced leaching water and the mitigation of toxic elements in the topsoil of the agroecosystem li et al 2018 chen et al 2013 2018 fig 7b shows that the input rates of u due to the current irrigation system contribute more than 87 to the total input rates of u in the soil 3 3 2 daily output rates due to water leaching and plant uptake fig 8a shows the daily output rates of u estimated for the water spinach soil in the study area the output rate of u from the topsoil layer due to the uptake process of water spinach is 0 08 bq m 2 d 1 and it contributes 24 13 to the total output rate of u the leaching rate of u is 0 252 0 249 and 0 275 bq m 2 d 1 estimated by cemc hydrus 1d and de meeus models respectively there are some differences between the leaching rates predicted by the models indeed it is usually found in some literature that the differences between the results predicted by various models as a consequence of the different parameterizations used and authors must try to minimize them marín benito et al 2014 santos et al 2013 the total output rates of u from the topsoil are 0 332 0 329 and 0 355 bq m 2 d 1 predicted by cemc hydrus 1d and de meeus models respectively the good agreements between the leaching rates and the total rates of radionuclides estimated by the cemc soil model and the hydrus 1d model were found in the previous studies nguyen et al 2020a 2020b nguyen et al 2021b moreover the output rate of 226ra from the zeamay l soil was validated by the experiment in nguyen et al 2021 fig 8b shows that the water leaching is the most important process that contributes to the total decreasing rate of u in the topsoil the leaching rate contributes more than 75 to the total out rate of u from the water spinach topsoil this fraction was 74 09 and 96 52 predicted for water spinach and rice soils respectively in dong nai province vietnam nguyen et al 2020b 3 3 3 long term accumulation of u in the topsoil the assessment of the long term accumulation of u in the topsoil 0 20 cm due to agricultural practices based on input output rates of various processes shows a significant amount of u added to the water spinach soil fig 9 according to the proposed model the accumulation rate of u was from 0 31 to 14 16 bq kg 1 y 1 with an average value of 2 88 bq kg 1 y 1 the highest rate was predicted for water sample 5 au 706 mbq l 1 while the lowest rate was predicted for water sample 13 au 33 9 mbq l 1 significant differences in accumulation rates were found between the soils irrigated by different groundwater samples some studies found the accumulation of u in the topsoils the research of mcdowell carried out on the topsoil samples 0 7 5 cm depth in new zealand in the period from 1952 to 1958 found no significant difference in concentrations of u mcdowell 2012 our previous study in dong nai province vietnam showed that activity concentrations of 238u decrease in both water spinach and rice soils the decreasing rates are 0 30 bq kg 1 y 1 and 0 21 bq kg 1 y 1 found in water spinach and rice soils respectively nguyen et al 2020b according to the previous researches we found that the high accumulation rate of u in the topsoil is caused by high activity concentrations of u in the groundwater samples under the current agricultural practice in the field 25 year water spinach cultivation significantly increases the activity concentration of u in the topsoil for soil irrigated with groundwater sample 13 groundwater with the lowest activity of u the activity concentration of u can reach 37 7 bq kg 1 for soil irrigated with groundwater sample 5 groundwater with the highest activity of u and the activity concentration of u can reach 325 bq kg 1 we predicted that the current agricultural practices cause an increase in u activity in the water spinach soil after 25 years of water spinach cultivation the activity concentrations of u increase from 6 52 to 294 bq kg 1 with an average value of 59 8 bq kg 1 because of a high rate of u accumulation in the water spinach soil some ways were proposed to obtain a lower load of u in the topsoil firstly we suggest using irrigation water and fertilizer sources with low u concentrations other water sources such as surface water e g lakes and rivers and rainwater with a low concentration of u are recommended for the irrigation system in the study area moreover u testing in groundwater is essential before setting irrigation plans secondly some methods are applied to remove u from the irrigation water finally using surface water or accumulated rainwater can reduce u in the topsoil fig 10 shows the long term accumulation of u in the water spinach soil predicted by the cemc soil model hydrus 1d model and de meeus model although a bit of difference was found between the leaching rates based on three models fig 8a the results of long term accumulations of u were nearly equal indeed it is typically found in some works of literature that the differences between the results predicted by various models as a consequence of the different parameterizations used and authors must try to minimize them marín benito et al 2014 santos et al 2013 besides that the difference is due to the mathematic functions that are used for the models in our previous studies a good agreement was found between long term accumulations of radionuclides in the topsoils based on the cemc soil model and hydrus 1d model nguyen et al 2020a nguyen et al 2020b nguyen et al 2021 3 4 u removal using k2feo4 using k2feo4 to recover u from the groundwater is one of the effective methods to reduce u activity in the contaminated groundwater in this study we proposed the simple process for removing u isotopes from the groundwater samples as discussed in section 2 5 fig 11 shows the comparison of the activity concentrations of 234u and 238u before and after the performance of the removal procedure the removal efficiency of 234u was from 61 97 3 97 to 94 08 1 03 with an average value of 81 34 3 32 the highest value and the lowest value were found in groundwater sample 3 and groundwater sample 2 respectively the removal efficiency of 238u was from 64 64 7 89 to 95 91 0 99 with an average value of 74 28 4 98 the highest value and the lowest value were found in groundwater sample 3 and groundwater sample 9 respectively it was found that ph of the centrifuge solution influenced significantly on the removal efficiency of u in this study the optimum values of ph for u removal were found from 4 60 to 8 12 this agrees with the results of vladimir et al 2016 they found that the ph values of water from 5 0 to 7 7 were good for the removal of u using k2feo4 4 conclusion by using the new technique for u separation applied for the alpha spectrometer the activity concentrations of u isotopes were analyzed in thu duc district ho chi minh city vietnam analyzing u in 15 groundwater samples showed wide ranges of 234u activity 20 2 438 mbq l 1 and 238u activity 13 5 268 mbq l 1 from the results in this study the radiological risks of using the contaminated groundwater samples to human health are not recommended however the recent agricultural practices using groundwater for irrigation in the study area were predicted to cause a significant increase of u in the topsoil and must be mitigated our proposed models predicted the accumulation rate of u in the water spinach soil could reach 14 16 bq kg 1 y 1 long term accumulation of u was assessed for 25 years of agricultural practices good agreement was found between the results based on the various models the mitigation method using potassium perrate k2feo4 was proposed to remove u from the groundwater based on the new method the u removal efficiency of 15 groundwater samples ranged from 61 97 95 91 according to this study using other water sources was recommend to reduce the increasing rate of u in the topsoil declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

1343,groundwater is regularly used for many purposes such as drinking and agricultural irrigation systems still it contains high levels of radionuclides e g 238u 232th and 226ra that are potentially hazardous to humans and the environment in this study activity concentrations of uranium isotopes were analyzed in 15 groundwater samples taken from 15 bored wells in thu duc district ho chi minh city vietnam environmental effects of the irrigation system with groundwater on agricultural soil in the study area were assessed by models it was found that the activity concentrations of 238u and 234u in groundwater samples were in the ranges of 13 5 268 7 mbq l 1 and 20 2 438 3 mbq l 1 respectively the ratio 234u 238u values were ranged from 1 12 to 2 with an average value of 1 44 based on the model prediction 25 years irrigation with the groundwater can inject 94 8 bq both uranium isotopes in 1 kg topsoil for investigated groundwater samples the proposed removal method using k2feo4 removed 74 28 and 81 04 for 234u and 238u respectively keywords p100 purolite resin potassium ferrate k2feo4 hydrus 1d model cemc soil model 1 introduction 238u and 235u decay series contribute a significant part of naturally occurring radioactive materials norm in the beginning these primordial radionuclides have formed in the earth s soils and rocks from soil rock systems they move to other parts of the environment such as groundwater surface water air and plants in which they strongly affect human health by their decay as flow through the deep soil layers which have high concentrations of norm

activity concentrations of uranium isotopes and their daughter radionuclides in groundwater were determined in some regions nguyen et al 2011 le et al 2015 nguyen et al 2020a some samples of groundwater contain high levels of uranium isotopes that must be concerned for public health three uranium isotopes 238u 235u and 234u of the 238u and 235u decay series can be measured by alpha spectroscopy the activity concentrations of these isotopes are based on the counts on the alpha energy peaks 4775 kev 234u 4198 kev 235u and 4398 kev 238u borylo 2013 to adapt to the measurements with the alpha spectroscopy many chemical methods are employed to extract uranium from the groundwater samples janda et al 2015 lee and lee 2001 dartiguelongue et al 2016 one of the processes of evaporation co precipitation and electrodeposition creates a thin flat sample that is adaptable to the measurement with the alpha spectroscopy mola et al 2013 astm 2012 in this study we introduced a new method for extraction uranium from groundwater using the p100 gel column in which the dilute hno3 with various concentrations was used for extraction and striping phases the uranium samples were then prepared by the electrodeposition method astm 2012 because the contamination of uranium isotopes in groundwater are potentially hazardous to human health and the environment they must be reduced to the minimum levels before utilization there are many studies focused on the method for the removal of uranium from groundwater choi et al 2019 saha et al 2020 stephanie et al 2020 nariyan et al 2018 chen et al 2020 phillips et al 2008 adsorption is considered an attractive method because of its high adsorption efficiencies and available raw materials various materials such as organic

water li et al 2020 fe3o4 in an aqueous solution was studied for the removal of uranium from wastewater by combining with an electrodeposition system katerina et al 2019 lu et al 2018 for those methods the properties of the sample solution e g ph type of the solution and acid concentration were important factors controlling the removal efficiency of uranium zhang et al 2019 li et al 2020 katerina et al 2019 lu et al 2018 since few rivers are located in the study area groundwater was still used as the primary water source for the agricultural irrigation systems throughout the world many studies were focusing on the accumulation of u in agricultural soils schnug and haneklaus 2015 schipper et al 2011 taylor 2007 pearson et al 2019 bigalke et al 2017 however few studies found that irrigation water was the primary source that contributes natural radionuclides to the agricultural soils and long term irrigation with groundwater caused an accumulation of natural radionuclides in the topsoils nguyen et al 2020a nguyen et al 2021 bigalke et al 2018 in the agricultural soil the fate of u was considered by some hydrology and environmental processes such as plant uptake leaching to the subsoil volatilization erosion radioactive decay etc plant uptake and water leaching are two main processes that contribute to the change rate of u in the topsoil nguyen et al 2020a nguyen et al 2020b nguyen et al 2021 there were some models validated to simulate the fate of u in the topsoil such as cemc models hydrus models etc nguyen et al 2020b jakubowski et al 2008 in this study plant uptake and water leaching were considered as the main processes that contributed to the decreasing rate of u in the topsoil besides that fertilization and irrigation are two main processes that contributed to the increasing rate of u in the topsoil the leaching rate of u from the topsoil was assessed by multi models the activity concentrations of uranium isotopes in the topsoil were predicted by the method that was introduced in our previous studies nguyen et al 2020a nguyen et al 2020b nguyen et al 2021 contamination of natural radionuclides in agricultural soils causes potential health risks to the population by its radiation effects although the activity concentrations of radionuclides in the topsoils have been widely investigated the potential links between their activities in the topsoil and other parts of the agricultural ecosystem such as irrigation water and fertilizers remain unclear moreover how agricultural cultivations change their activities in topsoil have not been studied the study therefore aims to 1 determine u in groundwater by an alpha spectroscopy using a new sample preparation method 2 propose an effective ways for mitigation of u in the contaminated groundwater and soil 3 assess the accumulation rate of u in the agricultural soil due to the irrigation system 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area in this study 15 groundwater samples were collected from the public water supply wells in ho chi minh city vietnam fig 1 the city is the biggest city located in the south eastern region of vietnam a total of 2095 km2 of lowland which is 19 m above sea level is divided into 24 districts the study was carried out in thu duc district which is one of the biggest districts of the city dong nai and saigon rivers are two primary water sources that supply water for human activities and agricultural irrigation systems besides that groundwater is used popularly in some regions of the city many studies found significant degrees of pollution due to heavy metals and radioactive materials in groundwater in ho chi minh city le et al 2015 tran 2019 therefore it is necessary to find effective methods to remove the pollutants from groundwater in this region moreover the effects of groundwater utilization for agricultural irrigation have not been discussed nguyen et al 2020a 2020b 2021 found that the activity concentrations of some natural radionuclides increased significantly in some agricultural soils in vietnam however no such studies have been carried out in ho chi minh city and on u isotopes 2 2 groundwater sampling and analysis in the study area groundwater samples were taken at the top of the water column of bored wells nguyen et al 2020a 2020b found high activity concentrations of uranium isotopes in the water of this well type locations of the sampling sites by region are presented in fig 1 and the corresponding coordinates are shown in table 1 about 2 l of groundwater collected from bored wells were used for uranium analysis the ph of groundwater was recorded immediately at the sampling time the ph was measured using ph test strips testr 30 from eutech the uncertainty of the ph adjustment is 0 01 the ph values of the groundwater samples are presented in table 1 uranium isotopes were analyzed by the alpha spectroscopy canberra equipped with passivated implanted planar silicon detectors pips fig 2 the recent system includes two a1200 37 am detectors which have an active area of 1200 mm2 dead layer thickness 140 μm and leakage current about 12 na at 20 c the energy resolution at 5638 kev of 241am was lower than 20 kev fwhm with a detector to source spacing equal to the detector diameter the efficiency of spectroscopy depends on the distance between the detector and the sample based on the calibrations with a 241am point source the efficiency of 25 is achievable with the close detector to source spacing 5 mm the gap between sample and detector can be adjust form 4 mm to 40 mm 4 mm per a step the background of the measurement chamber was lower than one count per hour the lower limit of detection for 24 h of counting time was 0 12 mbq l 1 for alpha emitter radionuclides in water samples genie 2000 is a comprehensive set of capabilities for acquiring and analyzing spectra from multichannel analyzers mcas its functions include mca control spectral display and manipulation basic spectrum analysis and reporting fig 3 shows the alpha spectrum of sample 3 which was measured for 24 h by the spectroscopy because of the low background radiation in the measurement chamber and the uranium separation procedure the energy peaks of 234u and 238u were displayed clearly in the spectrum fig 4 explains the method for sample preparation to measure uranium activity in a groundwater sample the procedure can be divided into two main steps 1 uranium extraction and 2 uranium deposition fig 4a describes the p100 column 12 8 mm for uranium extraction the tube contains about 2 g of p100 resin washed two times with dilute nitric acid the sample solution hno3 ph 2 has flowed through the column the flow rate was about 1 ml min 1 the uranium was then removed from the resin by 2 m hno3 the final solution 2 m hno3 was evaporated to dryness and the residue was kept for the next step fig 4b describes the method to prepare the uranium samples that are suitable for analysis with alpha spectroscopy the uranium fraction obtained after separation was reconstituted by adding 1 ml of hno3 10 and 10 ml of nh4 2so4 0 23 m this solution was heated and its ph was adjusted until the change of indicator was a yellow color by the addition of concentrated nh4oh drop by drop the solution was then transferred to an electrodeposition cell and put into the electrodeposition system fig 4b the process that uranium deposited on the sample disk had taken place for 60 min under a current density of 0 5 a cm 1 the stainless steel disks were about 20 mm in diameter the anode was a polished platinum spiral wire following the deposition the disk was dried in the furnace at 400 c for 5 min and then counted for 24 h by the alpha spectroscopy to determine the activity of uranium isotopes to find out the chemical yield of the procedure that performed the determination of uranium isotopes the following experiment was carried out five water samples were spiked with the tracers 0 22 0 01 bq each sample and prepared with the above procedure the results of the experiments showed that the efficiency values of u absorption on the p100 column were from 91 40 6 11 to 99 36 0 17 with the mean value of 96 72 2 57 the efficiency values of u striping from the p100 column were from 84 76 9 01 to 93 39 10 74 with the mean value of 90 67 4 77 the efficiency values of u electrodeposition were from 62 73 5 39 to 96 74 7 20 with the mean value of 91 82 6 23 totally the chemical yield based on the sampling procedure for the standard solution was 80 52 7 30 2 3 dose assessment according to unscear 2006 the annual effective dose due to drinking water was calculated by eq 1 1 d e i a dcf u where de is the annual effective dose due to drinking of groundwater samples μsv y 1 i is the consumption intake rate of groundwater 730 l y 1 a is the activity concentration of u isotope in the water samples bq l 1 and dcfu is the dose conversion factor of the u isotope according to icrp 2012 according to the icrp report the dcfu values are 7 6 10 9 and 8 3 10 9 sv bq 1 for 238u and 234u respectively the annual intake rate of 730 l y 1 was based on many studies galán lópez et al 2004 somlai et al 2007 todorovic et al 2012 2 4 long term change of u activity in the topsoil due to agricultural irrigation 2 4 1 proposed model the proposed model used to predict the long term change of u activity in the topsoil was described by fig 5 due to various processes the activity concentrations of u isotopes in the topsoil can increase or decrease in this study the activity concentration of the u isotope in the topsoil was expressed by the formula as eq 2 nguyen et al 2020a nguyen et al 2020b nguyen et al 2021 2 c a b l l l u 1 e l l l u t c 0 e l l l u t where c bq kg 1 is the activity concentration of u isotope in the topsoil at the time of t days c0 bq kg 1 is the activity concentration of u isotope which is available in the topsoil at the beginning a bq d 1 is the daily input of u isotope due to water irrigation b bq d 1 is the daily input of u isotope due to fertilization ll and lu are the partitions of the u isotope lost by processes of water leaching and plant uptake respectively other minor factors such as radioactive decay volatilization soil erosion excavation drainage radioactive deposition and earthworms that contribute to the total change rate of u isotope in the topsoil were excluded from the models because they were negligible 2 4 2 data collection the investigated field was located in the study area in this field water spinach ipomoea aquatica forssk is cultivated three seasons per year it is harvested three times during the duration of crop for long term estimation we assumed that the same irrigation and fertilization practices had been applied to the field according to the current agricultural practices in the investigated area the average irrigation rate was observed about 200 m3 ha 1 d 1 normally if it is not raining the irrigation is scheduled twice a day some chemical fertilizers had been applied to the site to improve crop yields the average application rates were about 250 350 30 kg ha 1 season 1 for npk 20 20 15 npk super phosphate p and kcl k respectively the activity concentrations of u isotopes in fertilizers applied for the investigated field were presented by truong et al 2018 according to this study the activity concentration of 238u were 62 2 46 5 and 1 3 bq kg 1 found in npk p and k fertilizers respectively the activity concentration of u was analyzed in soil and water spinach by the previous study they were 31 2 bq kg 1 and 10 5 bq kg 1 in soil and water spinach respectively the soil to water spinach transfer factors of u were 0 34 bui et al 2020 the soil properties used for model assessments such as water organic matter mineral matter air clay sand silt etc are present in table 1 soil water content is the mass of water in the soil measured as the difference between the moist soil and the soil dried at 105 c soil air content is the ratio of the volume of air to the volume of voids air content and water content are mostly represented in percentage in table 1 the solid liquid organic carbon water and mineral matter water partition coefficients were based on the iaea technical report iaea 2010 2 4 3 estimation of the leaching rate of u in this study the fates of 238u and 234u in the soil layer based on modelling were similar the leaching rate of u both 234u and 238u was predicted by the cemc soil model hydrus 1d model and the de meeus model the methods for the prediction of u leaching rate using the cemc soil model and the hydrus 1d model were discussed in detail in our previous nguyen et al 2020b the leaching rate of u from the topsoil based on the de meeus model was discussed in the publications de meeus et al 2002 and qian et al 2018 according to the publications the leaching rate of u dl was calculated by eq 3 3 d l 1000 f k d d p ρ where dp is the depth of plough layer m ρ is the soil bulk density kg m 3 kd is solid liquid partition coefficient l kg 1 and f is the annual precipitation excess m y 1 the annual precipitation excess f is given by the product of the rate of precipitation p m y 1 and the fraction of water that infiltrates the soil de meeûs et al 2002 4 f p f inf where f is the fraction of water that infiltrates the soil for the soil collected from the field the f value was 0 2 for three model the fate of uranium in the topsoil layer 20 cm was simulated the 20 cm of air layer was applied for the top boundary the lower boundary conditions will have a huge impact on predictions of water movement in any hydrological model for three models free drainage boundary was used for the lower boundary such a situation often occurs in field studies of water flow and drainage in the vadose zone this lower boundary condition is most appropriate for situation where the water table lies far below the domain of interest 2 5 uranium removal using k2feo4 absorbent u contaminated in groundwater samples was absorbed by the potassium ferrate k2feo4 the method is summarised in fig 6 principally the removal mechanisms of u including of adsorption co precipitate and surface complexation were revealed in other works he et al 2017 prucek et al 2015 kim et al 2015 firstly the compound of kno3 and fe powders 1 1 was heated to a liquid solution the solution was then cooled at room temperature to produce k2feo4 the bulk of k2feo4 was crushed to powders and they were filtered by the 0 2 mm sieve at the laboratory a groundwater sample 500 ml was reduced to 10 ml by heating on the sand bath the solution was then transferred to the centrifugation tube a volume of 1 ml k2feo4 powders was added to the solution the final solution was shocked in 15 min and then waited for 2 h before the centrifugation all tubes were placed into a centrifuge and they were centrifuged in 40 min at the speed of 2500 rev min finally the residue of k2feo4 which u was absorbed on was removed from the solution the activity concentrations of u isotopes before and after the u removal procedure were analyzed by the alpha spectrometer with the design introduced in section 2 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 activity concentrations of 234u and 238u table 2 summarizes the main measurement results on 15 groundwater samples that were collected in the study area the activity concentration of 238u was varied from 13 5 to 268 mbq l 1 with a mean value of 61 2 mbq l 1 the activity concentration of 234u was varied from 20 2 to 438 mbq l 1 with a mean value of 97 1 mbq l 1 they are lower than the maximum contaminant level for uranium recommended by the world health organization is 30 μgu l 1 about 370 mbq l 1238u who 2011 many studies were measuring the 234u and 238u concentrations in groundwater in the world most of the results showed that the activity concentrations of u isotopes in groundwater were higher than those in other water types such as rainwater surface water seawater tap water etc byong and chang 2019 ahmad et al 2020 ahmed 2018 sharma et al 2019 in groundwater in saudi arabia the average activity concentrations of 234u and 238u were 180 9 and 119 9 mbq l 1 respectively el sharkawy 2018 uranium concentrations a total of 82 samples in groundwater in icheon middle korea showed a wide range from 0 02 to 1640 μg l 1 with a mean of 56 77 μg l 1 most groundwater samples had relatively low concentrations 32 9 were below 1 μg l 1 while 15 9 exceeded 30 μg l 1 byong and chang 2019 ahmad et al 2020 found that the average level of 238u in groundwater in jordan was 33 mbq l 1 the concentration of u in groundwater in punjab india was found from 3 to 8 6 bq l 1 sharma et al 2019 as our study most of the studies in the world presented the u concentration in groundwater below the permissible limit of 30 μg l 1 recommended by world health organization who 2011 however in some particular areas such as uranium mines the concentration of u was found at a high level mathuthu et al 2020 hinck et al 2021 high uranium concentrations occur in groundwater around the world with values exceeding 2000 μg l in bedrock aquifers in norway reimann et al 2005 in namibia mathuthu et al 2020 found that the total activity of u in the groundwater around the uranium mine was 233 41 bq l 1 post et al 2017 presented the results of a study from burundi where dissolved uranium concentrations can exceed 700 μg l 1 the ratios of 234u 238u in the investigated groundwater samples ranged from 1 12 to 2 with an average value of 1 44 previous studies presented that the ratio depended on the mineralogical composition of the aquifer matrix and by the geochemical hydrochemical conditions of the sample site el sharkawy 2018 many investigations showed the 234u 238u ratio higher than 1 the uranium activity ratios 234u 238u in groundwater samples investigated in saudi arabia had an average value of 1 38 and ranged from 1 0 to 2 17 el sharkawy 2018 groundwater contains 234u isotopes with activities exceeding that of 238u due to the recoil of 234th and preferential leaching of 234u compared to 238u cherdyntsev 1955 rosholt et al 1963 kigoshi 1971 the rocks of aquifers partly lose intermediate u decay products due to the α recoil when the 238u atom decay is accompanied by the α particle ejection while the produced recoil 234th atom is ejected in the opposite direction if the decay occurs near the rock liquid interface this atom enters water to be rapidly transformed into 234u owing to this process the ratio between the 234u and 238u activities decreases in the rock as compared with their equilibrium value and groundwater to be enriched with excessive 234u isotope in some coastal regions it was found that the relationship between the 234u 238u ratios in groundwater and seawater from the discharge zone in a coastal area of spain rodrigo et al 2014 found the 234u 238u ratios from 1 135 to 1 336 with an average value of 1 15 few studies showed the 234u 238u ratio is lower than 1 mathuthu et al 2020 found the ratio of 234u 238u was 5 52 10 05 the ratio below 1 indicates the presence of freshly extracted uranium rhodes et al 2006 von oertzen 2014 whereas a ratio exceeding 1 indicates the origin as natural sediments in groundwater 3 2 health risks assessment based on the recommendations of the world health organization who 2011 the provisional guideline 238u content is 0 030 mg l 1 chemical aspects which corresponds to an alpha activity of approximately 0 4 bq l 1 however groundwater also contains 234u isotopes with activities exceeding that of 238u due to the recoil of 234th and preferential leaching of 234u compared to 238u the 234u 238u activity ratio can reach 10 and more and the gross alpha activity increases by the same factor moreover there are other radionuclides such as 210pо 210pb 226ra and 232th contributed to the gross alpha activity in groundwater the screening levels for drinking water below which no further action is required are 0 5 bq l 1 for gross alpha activity therefore with high u activity some samples such as samples 5 and 7 should be performed a further analysis to assess properly to assess the health risks due to drinking groundwater to the local population the annual effective dose de was estimated as eq 1 the annual effective dose due to intaking food crops irrigated with groundwater was insignificant and not considered in this study nguyen et al 2019 the results of the de are presented in table 2 de ranged from 0 198 to 4 141 μsv y 1 with an average value of 0 928 μsv y 1 the results showed that all values of de were much lower than the recommended dose due to drinking water and ingestion of food 300 μsv y 1 unscear 2008 who 2011 however this values are not sufficient to assess the radiological risk due to drinking water because other radionuclides that contribute to the effective dose must be taken into account 3 3 long term accumulation of u in the agricultural soil 3 3 1 daily input rates due to agricultural practices fig 7a shows the daily input rates of u estimated for the water spinach soil in the study area the application of inorganic fertilizers which contain various levels of 238u and 234u caused a significant increase of u in the soil as a result of fertilization practices discussed in section 2 4 2 the input rate of u is 0 079 bq m 2 d 1 was estimated for water spinach soil some studies estimated the accumulation of u in agricultural soils due to various fertilization practices schipper et al 2011 had observed the accumulation rate of u in the new zealand pastoral soils due to the application of superphosphate fertilizer in this long term study considering superphosphate application over 23 years an annual application of fertilizer at 50 kg p ha 1 y 1 was estimated to result in a yearly rate of accumulation of 0 042 mg u kg 1 0 52 bq 238u kg 1 y 1 similarly in an earlier study of four new zealand soils the annual uranium accumulation rates were reported as ranging between 0 015 0 047 mg kg 1 0 19 0 58 bq 238u kg 1 y 1 taylor 2007 in comparison with schipper et al 2011 and taylor s 2007 studies our u input rate lower than their results the main reason is the high u concentration found in fertilizers in their studies due to the current irrigation system with groundwater samples the input rates of u in the water spinach soil are shown in fig 7a the rates are from 0 539 to 10 445 bq m 2 d 1 with an average value of 2 343 bq m 2 d 1 we found that the irrigation practices contributed the most significant fractions to the total increasing rates of radionuclides in the investigated soil some studies indicated that irrigation was the most critical factor that potentially influenced leaching water and the mitigation of toxic elements in the topsoil of the agroecosystem li et al 2018 chen et al 2013 2018 fig 7b shows that the input rates of u due to the current irrigation system contribute more than 87 to the total input rates of u in the soil 3 3 2 daily output rates due to water leaching and plant uptake fig 8a shows the daily output rates of u estimated for the water spinach soil in the study area the output rate of u from the topsoil layer due to the uptake process of water spinach is 0 08 bq m 2 d 1 and it contributes 24 13 to the total output rate of u the leaching rate of u is 0 252 0 249 and 0 275 bq m 2 d 1 estimated by cemc hydrus 1d and de meeus models respectively there are some differences between the leaching rates predicted by the models indeed it is usually found in some literature that the differences between the results predicted by various models as a consequence of the different parameterizations used and authors must try to minimize them marín benito et al 2014 santos et al 2013 the total output rates of u from the topsoil are 0 332 0 329 and 0 355 bq m 2 d 1 predicted by cemc hydrus 1d and de meeus models respectively the good agreements between the leaching rates and the total rates of radionuclides estimated by the cemc soil model and the hydrus 1d model were found in the previous studies nguyen et al 2020a 2020b nguyen et al 2021b moreover the output rate of 226ra from the zeamay l soil was validated by the experiment in nguyen et al 2021 fig 8b shows that the water leaching is the most important process that contributes to the total decreasing rate of u in the topsoil the leaching rate contributes more than 75 to the total out rate of u from the water spinach topsoil this fraction was 74 09 and 96 52 predicted for water spinach and rice soils respectively in dong nai province vietnam nguyen et al 2020b 3 3 3 long term accumulation of u in the topsoil the assessment of the long term accumulation of u in the topsoil 0 20 cm due to agricultural practices based on input output rates of various processes shows a significant amount of u added to the water spinach soil fig 9 according to the proposed model the accumulation rate of u was from 0 31 to 14 16 bq kg 1 y 1 with an average value of 2 88 bq kg 1 y 1 the highest rate was predicted for water sample 5 au 706 mbq l 1 while the lowest rate was predicted for water sample 13 au 33 9 mbq l 1 significant differences in accumulation rates were found between the soils irrigated by different groundwater samples some studies found the accumulation of u in the topsoils the research of mcdowell carried out on the topsoil samples 0 7 5 cm depth in new zealand in the period from 1952 to 1958 found no significant difference in concentrations of u mcdowell 2012 our previous study in dong nai province vietnam showed that activity concentrations of 238u decrease in both water spinach and rice soils the decreasing rates are 0 30 bq kg 1 y 1 and 0 21 bq kg 1 y 1 found in water spinach and rice soils respectively nguyen et al 2020b according to the previous researches we found that the high accumulation rate of u in the topsoil is caused by high activity concentrations of u in the groundwater samples under the current agricultural practice in the field 25 year water spinach cultivation significantly increases the activity concentration of u in the topsoil for soil irrigated with groundwater sample 13 groundwater with the lowest activity of u the activity concentration of u can reach 37 7 bq kg 1 for soil irrigated with groundwater sample 5 groundwater with the highest activity of u and the activity concentration of u can reach 325 bq kg 1 we predicted that the current agricultural practices cause an increase in u activity in the water spinach soil after 25 years of water spinach cultivation the activity concentrations of u increase from 6 52 to 294 bq kg 1 with an average value of 59 8 bq kg 1 because of a high rate of u accumulation in the water spinach soil some ways were proposed to obtain a lower load of u in the topsoil firstly we suggest using irrigation water and fertilizer sources with low u concentrations other water sources such as surface water e g lakes and rivers and rainwater with a low concentration of u are recommended for the irrigation system in the study area moreover u testing in groundwater is essential before setting irrigation plans secondly some methods are applied to remove u from the irrigation water finally using surface water or accumulated rainwater can reduce u in the topsoil fig 10 shows the long term accumulation of u in the water spinach soil predicted by the cemc soil model hydrus 1d model and de meeus model although a bit of difference was found between the leaching rates based on three models fig 8a the results of long term accumulations of u were nearly equal indeed it is typically found in some works of literature that the differences between the results predicted by various models as a consequence of the different parameterizations used and authors must try to minimize them marín benito et al 2014 santos et al 2013 besides that the difference is due to the mathematic functions that are used for the models in our previous studies a good agreement was found between long term accumulations of radionuclides in the topsoils based on the cemc soil model and hydrus 1d model nguyen et al 2020a nguyen et al 2020b nguyen et al 2021 3 4 u removal using k2feo4 using k2feo4 to recover u from the groundwater is one of the effective methods to reduce u activity in the contaminated groundwater in this study we proposed the simple process for removing u isotopes from the groundwater samples as discussed in section 2 5 fig 11 shows the comparison of the activity concentrations of 234u and 238u before and after the performance of the removal procedure the removal efficiency of 234u was from 61 97 3 97 to 94 08 1 03 with an average value of 81 34 3 32 the highest value and the lowest value were found in groundwater sample 3 and groundwater sample 2 respectively the removal efficiency of 238u was from 64 64 7 89 to 95 91 0 99 with an average value of 74 28 4 98 the highest value and the lowest value were found in groundwater sample 3 and groundwater sample 9 respectively it was found that ph of the centrifuge solution influenced significantly on the removal efficiency of u in this study the optimum values of ph for u removal were found from 4 60 to 8 12 this agrees with the results of vladimir et al 2016 they found that the ph values of water from 5 0 to 7 7 were good for the removal of u using k2feo4 4 conclusion by using the new technique for u separation applied for the alpha spectrometer the activity concentrations of u isotopes were analyzed in thu duc district ho chi minh city vietnam analyzing u in 15 groundwater samples showed wide ranges of 234u activity 20 2 438 mbq l 1 and 238u activity 13 5 268 mbq l 1 from the results in this study the radiological risks of using the contaminated groundwater samples to human health are not recommended however the recent agricultural practices using groundwater for irrigation in the study area were predicted to cause a significant increase of u in the topsoil and must be mitigated our proposed models predicted the accumulation rate of u in the water spinach soil could reach 14 16 bq kg 1 y 1 long term accumulation of u was assessed for 25 years of agricultural practices good agreement was found between the results based on the various models the mitigation method using potassium perrate k2feo4 was proposed to remove u from the groundwater based on the new method the u removal efficiency of 15 groundwater samples ranged from 61 97 95 91 according to this study using other water sources was recommend to reduce the increasing rate of u in the topsoil declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

1344,chlorinated ethanes and ethenes isotopic analyses in groundwater and hydrogeochemical results from a former industrial area in sao paulo brazil were used to confirm the existence and allow further characterization of source areas and their commingled plumes both before and after thermal and bioremediation treatments prior to full scale remediation a recently identified off site source area with unknown history and limited access for further intrusive works presented lower δ13c values 6 5 to 1 8 for 1 2 dca than the downgradient on site source area 8 6 to 20 0 intermediate δ13c values for 1 2 dca were identified further downgradient from the sources within commingled plumes patterns the isotope and concentration results show the typical degradation patterns associated with biotic reductive dechlorination for chlorinated ethenes and dihaloelimination for 1 2 dca results following remediation treatments show further levels of isotopic enrichment for chlorinated ethenes and chlorinated ethanes in the tropically weathered and deeper fractured bedrock gneisses groundwater hydrogeochemical results isotopic mass balance and carbon chlorine isotope slopes data are coherent with remediation treatment and a complex commingled plume setting the results of this study confirmed the temporal conceptual model proposed by hart et al 2021 and identified the need for further studies to evaluate isotopic dynamics under thermal remediation including thermal induced hydrolysis processes keywords commingled plumes isotopic fingerprinting chlorinated ethanes and ethenes thermal remediation bioremediation 1 introduction chlorinated ethenes and ethanes are some of the most frequent contaminants detected in groundwater systems they have typically been used as solvents within industrial production processes and mainly during the second half of the last century they infiltrated the ground due to spills or improper residue disposal characteristics such as high density and solubility favoured them being mobilized to deep levels and transported with groundwater over long distances making remediation very challenging parker 2007 hunkeler et al 2011 barbosa 2019 murray et al 2019 multiple source areas with plumes under pumping influence of supply wells often exist at industrial regions which add complexity to the characterization of chlorinated compounds plumes parker 2007 l apiccirella 2009 lojkasek lima et al 2012 bertolo 2017 furthermore groundwater may be contaminated within a commingled plume configuration mixing contaminants from more than one source area potentially including unidentified polluters management of such complex scenarios including remediation strategies requires investigation using multiple lines of evidence and a setup of robust conceptual models kresic and mikszewski 2013 itrc 2017 hart et al 2021 traditional contaminant composition and concentration data when evaluated alone can be of limited use for the forensic determination of chlorinated ethenes and ethanes sources due to the effect of other processes such as dilution and degradation nijenhuis et al 2013 in addition complex areas typically present higher levels of uncertainties for example within a commingled plume scenario itrc 2017 various other tools may be employed together such as high resolution drilling tracer testing microbial evaluation and compound specific isotopic analysis hunkeler et al 2004 blessing et al 2009 eccarius et al 2012 lojkasek lima et al 2012 nijenhuis et al 2013 kaown et al 2016 njdep new jersey department of environmental protection 2017 the potential to fingerprint chlorinated organic compounds in source areas was first suggested by van warmerdam et al 1995 based on the isotopic analysis of specific synthetic chlorinated organic values for different producers the number of publications on forensic studies using the isotope tool in contaminated areas is increasing however often limited by legal aspects and confidentiality agreements philp 2015 teixeira and abreu 2018 the isotopic signatures can change over time due to natural or induced degradation processes however isotopic analyses and mass balances can assist in recognizing the fractionation patterns and pathways of degradation a guide for assessing biodegradation with single or multiple isotopes including several studies was published by usepa 2008 and confirms its vast potential in recent years the database for the application of the dual and triple isotope approach has continuously expanded including a large amount of contaminants degradation pathways and other complexity factors shouakar stash et al 2011 palau et al 2014 palau et al 2017a palau et al 2017b gafni et al 2018 torrentó et al 2021 regarding the evaluation of thermal remediation processes by using isotope tools there is a limited amount of publications badin et al 2016 and murray et al 2019 evaluated their effects at a site in denmark based on the evolution of isotopes for tetrachloroethylene pce degradation pathways the metropolitan region of sao paulo brazil presents a high potential for the existence of unidentified commingled plumes in its aquifers mainly in the historic extensive industrial neighbourhoods the public water supply system uses surface water reservoirs however it is supplemented by private wells which are estimated to be beyond 12 000 fusp 2009 comprehensive analytical monitoring data of the supply wells is limited however contamination with chlorinated solvents compounds and several management challenges have been identified and characterized hart et al 2007 l apiccirella 2009 fanti et al 2017 bertolo 2017 lojkasek lima 2018 barbosa 2019 hart et al 2021 the study area of this paper is located in the metropolitan region of sao paulo and presents a long industrial history and intensive groundwater use of the fractured crystalline bedrock aquifer until impacts by organic compounds were identified in bedrock wells for approximately 15 years it was understood this was related to an on site source where chlorinated ethanes predominated with lower content of chlorinated ethenes then an off site source area where chlorinated ethenes predominated with lower content of ethanes was initially identified with a limited number of boreholes near the upgradient boundary of the adjacent industry the source area extent history and plumes were unknown and access was restricted due to existing infra structure and activities this indicated there was potential for commingling with on site plumes in addition to limitations for further intrusive works the main objectives of this study were to further confirm chlorinated ethane and ethene source areas and characterize commingled plumes distribution and degradation before and after thermal and bioremediation treatment at the on site source area hydrogeochemical approaches including compound specific stable isotope analyses csia of chlorinated ethenes and ethanes were selected and applied a dual carbon chlorine isotope approach was also used to contribute to a better understanding of the chlorinated compounds degradation pathways 2 study site description 2 1 hydrogeology and temporal conceptual site the study area was a former chemical industry within the metropolitan region of sao paulo brazil see fig 1 over almost a century the region was mainly of industrial use but within the last two decades it is transforming into a more commercial and residential use the research area is in the alluvial plain of a river which is historically subject to flooding the total annual precipitation rate is around 1400 mm with the highest monthly precipitation rate up to 300 mm in january historic annual average temperature is approximately 20 c groundwater was extracted for the industrial process from the deep fractured bedrock aquifer by the operation of two on site groundwater supply wells pp 02 and pp 05 open borehole in the fresh rock and with a total depth of 250 m when traces of chlorinated solvents were identified these wells were operated within a pump treat remediation strategy and more recently turned into discrete multilevel wells named by the supply well name followed by the screen maximum depth as part of the monitoring network a temporal conceptual model was developed by hart et al 2021 after a review of the long term management results and contamination behaviour that occurred over time at this study site which is presented in fig 2 all the geological data were classified based on humid tropical soils and presented in hart et al 2021 the following units were identified from top to bottom fill materials alluvial sediments weathered rock soil and bedrock gneissic rock this unit was subdivided into soft weathered rock hard weathered rock and fresh rock this region presents two main aquifers units hirata and ferreira 2001 the cenozoic sedimentary deposits of the sao paulo basin with supply wells presenting a specific capacity of 0 48m3 h m and the underlying crystalline bedrock with supply wells presenting a specific capacity of 0 91 m3 h m the crystalline bedrock aquifer is subdivided into two highly heterogeneous and anisotropic horizons the weathered rock with dual porosity and the fresh rock with fracture porosity the phreatic groundwater surface is typically identified within 2 m below ground surface in the study area presenting a hydraulic gradient of approximately 1 groundwater flow velocities and directions were calculated for all the geological units above the bedrock and they range from less than 1 m to 11 m year with predominance towards south and southeast fig 1 within the bedrock groundwater flow velocity and direction were found to be highly heterogeneous and dependent on specific fracture setups recharge processes and eventual influence of pumping 2 2 investigation and remediation since 2000 the area has been subjected to various contaminated land investigation and remediation actions mainly excavation works and a pump treat system at pp 02 and pp 05 and shallower wells including near pmi 02 area fig 1 one chlorinated solvent source area was identified on site with a high predominance of 1 2 dichloroethane 1 2 dca a compound that was previously used on site as pure product for industrial purposes and lower concentrations of several chloroethane and chloroethene compounds by 2014 soil and groundwater quality had improved due to the above mentioned remediation actions mainly within the fill material unit concentrations at some deeper wells had not achieved remediation targets while a high resolution investigation including membrane interface probe mip confirmed persistence of anomalies in the on site source area at that time within the underlying sedimentary dark organic clay unit fig 2 its highest concentrations were typically detected near the later installed monitoring well pmg 01 fig 1 within soil and groundwater approximately 75 mg l for total volatile organic compounds voc and 32 mg l for 1 2 dca therefore the management strategy was revised to incorporate further investigations to diminish uncertainties an evaluation of new available technologies and a revision of the conceptual model in 2015 and 2016 new investigations and a localized bio remediation test beside pm 044 and pm 045 which can be identified in fig 1 were performed an off site area near the upgradient boundary of an off site active industrial area with restricted access presented unexpected high concentrations in soil between 2 4 m and 11 8 m deep mainly in fill materials and weathered rock soils and the associated groundwater these anomalies were not fully delineated laterally or further upgradient and the impact origin was considered unknown this area was located approximately 40 m northeast from the main on site source area well pmg 01 and in between them no major impacts were identified during mip soil and groundwater investigations the new investigations found the upgradient well pm 060f in the weathered rock soil unit presented the highest voc concentrations and a high predominance of pce with lower concentrations of several chloroethane and chloroethene compounds the high concentrations in soil and groundwater approximately 150 mg l for total voc and 60 mg l for pce within approximately 30 of pce solubility concentration limit suggested the potential existence of dense non aqueous phase liquid dnapl in this area this together with other lines of evidence such as spatial apparent discontinuity depths estimated flows high resolution investigation and geochemical signatures was considered indicative of the existence of a nearby unknown off site source area and a commingled plume configuration in order to further evaluate this understanding without new intrusive off site works the investigations followed with the isotopic studies carried out before and after new full scale remediation works discussed later on in this paper a new remediation strategy was defined and implemented on site between 2016 and the first semester of 2018 fig 3 electro thermal remediation was applied between october 2016 and may 2017 to treat the whole on site source area delineated based on detailed soil and groundwater analytical results within the organic clay level of the alluvial sediments unit temperatures were increased and stabilized around 100 c over approximately 4 months in order to mobilize contaminant via solubilisation and volatilization processes followed by liquid and vapour phase recovery via negatively pressurized systems temperature variation can potentially enhance or limit bioremediation temperatures in the mesophilic range between 25 and 40 c have found to result in higher contaminant bioavailability and biodegradability with very limited bacterial populations above 60 c leite et al 2021 heating also induces hydrolysis which is a process of direct destruction of the compounds for the thermal hydrolysis process of 1 2 dca the expected equation is presented below palau et al 2017a resulting in production of ethylene glycol and chloride with ph decrease c 2 h 4 cl 2 2h 2 o c 2 h 6 o 2 2h 2cl monitoring of the applied thermal remediation indicated that targets were achieved and 176 kg of chlorinated solvents were recovered 99 5 in vapour phase and the remaining as liquid phase it was also estimated based on initial final mass calculations temperatures measurements and theoretical assumptions that thermal works had induced the degradation of additional 491 kg via hydrolysis pathway mainly for 1 2 dca followed by 1 1 dca the new remediation strategy also included bioremediation that was applied mainly between 2017 and the first semester of 2018 to treat the on site source area associated plumes identified mainly within the eluvial soil and weathered soil geological units the process was based on the promotion of biotic reductive dechlorination via injection of a carbon source molasses into a network of dedicated remediation wells during thermal treatment this substrate was injected at further downgradient areas and once heating ceased injections took place throughout the study area including beneath the heated horizon the bedrock levels typically less impacted were not subject to direct heating or injections however indirect positive effects related to the remediation at shallower levels were expected 3 materials and methods 3 1 sampling strategy the site monitoring well network included more than 100 sampling locations and were sampled every semester or more intensively during some remediation works at specific locations for groundwater chemical analyses a group of selected wells were sampled for groundwater isotopic analyses in 2016 after the 2015 localized bio remediation pilot test and prior to the thermal and full scale bio remediation and in 2019 two years after the end of the thermal remediation and one year after the last molasses injection the wells were selected fig 1 in order to include spatially representative locations source areas and the plumes along the groundwater flow system in total 28 different wells were sampled in both or either in the first or the second campaigns some wells were sampled for isotopes only in the 2019 because they were installed after the 2016 campaign and others removed due to the thermal treatment the groundwater sampling procedures followed the low flow method protocols usepa 2017 due to the thermal remediation an additional procedure was performed in the 2019 campaign when groundwater temperature was identified more than 10 c above initial background levels in these cases a cooling system was added externally without contact to the low flow closed lines in order to reduce temperatures to initial background levels before groundwater samples collection samples were stored and preserved following laboratories instructions then immediately labelled refrigerated within ice boxes and sent with chain of custodies for analyses samples were followed to guarantee minimum possible transport time 3days in the case of the international laboratory in order to facilitate data interpretation the wells were classified within two major groups porous group related to locations where intergranular porosity dominates which included wells installed in the fill material alluvial sediments and weathered rock soil geological units groundwater in most of these wells including the on site source area around pmg 01 fig 3 was targeted for remediation the off site main source well pm 060f fig 3 is also part of this group but is located up gradient and was not a remediation target the second type bedrock group is related to locations where fracture porosity may predominate and included those wells installed in the deeper geological units soft weathered rock hard weathered rock or fresh rock 3 2 analyses groundwater chemical analyses were conducted for approximately 70 standard chlorinated voc plus degradation products ethene and ethane the following hydrogeochemical parameters were analysed as part of the thermal and bioremediation evaluation oxidation reduction potential orp temperature electrical conductivity ph dissolved oxygen sulphate total organic carbon toc sulphide total alkalinity chloride and methane some parameters such as orp were not always monitored at wells that presented high temperatures due to the risk of damaging the equipment some wells samples were also eventually analysed for dissolved iron dissolved manganese nitrate and ammonium nitrogen all analyses were conducted following united states of america standard analytical and quality control assurance procedures and methods e g epa 8260c for voc in the laboratories located in sao paulo of the international company merieux nutrisciences isotopic analysis were conducted for the chlorinated compounds and degradation products most typically identified at the site pce trichloroethene tce cis 1 2 dichloroethene cis 1 2 dce vinyl chloride vc 1 1 2 2 tetrachloroethane 1 1 2 2 teca 1 1 2 trichloroethane 1 1 2 tca 1 2 dca 1 1 dichloroethene 1 1 dce 1 1 dichloroethane 1 1 dca ethene and ethane chloroethane is also a potential chlorinated ethane degradation product of 1 2 dca however was not isotopically analysed due to none detectable or low concentrations during the first and second sampling campaigns carbon isotopes were analysed at the organic geochemistry laboratory of the university of oklahoma usa during the second campaign chlorine isotopic analyses for chlorinated ethenes were added to the analytical plan and were performed at the same laboratory quality control and assurance measures were applied including sample custody traceability controls control samples and duplicates analyses the analytical precision was calculated as 0 5 or lower for all carbon and chlorine isotope analyses detection limit was typically 1 μg l depending on compound response for each sample results were reported in standard delta notation following methods described by usepa 2008 and laboratory internal procedures standards were reported to be commercially obtained calibrated to the appropriate international isotope scale vpdb vsmow or smoc or developed using high purity e g acs grade specimens based on off line isotope ratio analysis national or international certifications systems specifically for compound specific isotopic analyses did not exist that could be applied to certify the laboratory the laboratory internal procedures for isotopic analyses indicate that volatile compounds were extracted from water using a purge and trap apparatus pt and then transferred to a gas chromatograph gc and a mass spectrometer for low molecular weight compounds including chlorinated ethenes the pt transfer line is connected to a polar phase column analytes eluting from the transfer line are trapped using a cryogenic focuser prior to being transferred to a main gc column for target compound separation for carbon the separated analytes are directed through a thermal conversion reactor and converted individually to pulses of surrogate gas product co2 for isotope ratio determination via an isotope ratio monitoring mass spectrometer irms the chlorine ratios are determined without thermal conversion using a standard quadrupole mass spectrometer qms operated within a single ion mode the ratio of 37cl 35cl is calculated with the results of scanning two cl bearing mass fragments with identical structure first one containing 35cl and no 37cl and the second containing a single 37cl 3 3 isotopic mass balance isotopic mass balances were applied for total chlorinated ethanes and ethenes to further evaluate the complete sequential degradation pathways and influence of multiple sources hunkeler et al 1999 nijenhuis et al 2013 badin et al 2016 murray et al 2019 this was applied for each sampling point and taking into account sequential degradation substances for which both isotope and concentrations values were available the isotopic values of the total chlorinated ethenes δ13cce pce tce cis dce and vc and chlorinated ethanes δ13cca 1 1 2 tca 1 2 dca was calculated by multiplying the molar concentration of each compound ci with its respective carbon isotope signature δ13ci adding all contributions and dividing by the total molar concentration cce eq 1 nijenhuis et al 2013 1 δ 13 c ce c i δ 13 c i c ce the error associated with the isotopic mass balance can be calculated by error propagation badin et al 2016 however uncertainties include several factors analytical errors limited amount of analysis multiple sources different hydrogeological units and multiple degradation pathways towards ethene and ethane therefore not included in the isotope mass balance 4 results and discussions 4 1 evolution of hydrogeochemical conditions the hydrogeochemical results for the campaigns that included isotopic analyses 2016 and 2019 are presented as supplementary material table 1 of si the hydrogeochemical results prior to remediation for the porous and bedrock group wells presented in general reducing anaerobic conditions results after remediation typically did not indicate major changes in orp however mainly for the porous group wells sulphate decreased and methane increased for example at the on site source well pmg 01 between 2016 and 2019 orp changed from 107 1 to 109 0 mv sulphate decreased from 110 0 to below 5 0 mg l methane increased from 7 4 to 30 5 mg l in 2019 two years after the thermal treatment both porous and bedrock group wells typically presented temperatures more than 3 c higher than in 2016 with most different measurements identified at porous well pm 044f from 21 8 to 32 0 c and bedrock pp 02 79 3 m from 19 8 to 25 4 c more steady conditions for all of these parameters were identified at the off site source area well pm 60f which was not targeted for remediation the bedrock group wells were also not directly targeted for remediation however hydrogeochemical changes were identified such as temperature and methane increases sulphate decreases table 1 of si and confirmed the influence of thermal and bioremediation this was possibly enhanced by the groundwater downwards vertical flow pattern and aquifer high connectivity previously that were noted during hydrogeological tests hart et al 2021 the overall hydrogeochemical results indicate that the thermal and bioremediation treatment promoted a long term lasting effect in the targeted and underlying areas including temperature increase and enhancement of sulphate reducing and methanogenesis conditions an example of groundwater time series measurements during the thermal treatment is presented in fig 4 the well pmg 01 was screened in the sedimentary dark organic clay level and located approximately 2 m from an electro heating device during the heating period voc total mass calculated adding all detectable voc not ethane or ethane decreased likely due to both hydrolysis and volatilization processes chloride increased and ph decreased as expected for the hydrolysis process toc concentrations increased possibly due to a solubilisation process of natural carbon mainly from the organic clay layer in addition it is noticeable that methane concentrations decreased during this period possible due to volatilization and ceasing of natural biodegradation activity sulphate presented slight increase which also suggests that limited biodegradation activity was taking place after the heating treatment period temperature gradually decreased and the trend of decreasing voc continued at slower rate sulphate decreased and methane increased which supports that biodegradation of respectively voc and toc returned possibly stimulated by residual temperature nearer microbial optimum levels around 40 c horst et al 2018 leite et al 2021 an example of groundwater time series of measurements during the localized bioremediation pilot test is presented in fig 5 this test was conducted in 2015 followed by the isotopic 2016 sampling campaign and after by the full scale bio and thermal remediation works the well pm 048f fig 3 was screened in the weathered soil unit orp was not included in this figure as the available data suggested limited changes around 155 0mv this well initially presented some of the highest contaminant concentrations of the on site source area and was located approximately 1 m from an injection well later removed together with well pm 048f due to the thermal works results indicated that approximately 3 months after the molasses injection event voc toc sulphate concentrations and ph decreased while methane concentration increased chloride concentrations initially slightly increased followed by a decreasing tendency period temperature remained fairly stable during the last monitoring events methane toc and ph returned to levels similar to baseline these results are all consistent with the expected biotic reductive dechlorination reactions 4 2 chlorinated ethene and ethane concentrations molar mass fractions of all main compounds together with total voc concentrations only for chlorinated compounds in order to evaluate remediation effects on the most toxic compounds of the selected 28 monitoring wells are presented in fig 6a and b for respectively porous and bedrock wells voc concentrations are presented in table 2 of si the highest total voc concentrations in the on site source area was detected in pmg 01 within the organic clay unit with 1 2 dca showing the highest concentration followed by 1 1 dca vc cis 1 2 dce and a very low content of tce fig 6a table 1 of si these results suggest a distinct signature of mixed compounds chlorinated ethanes and to less degree ethenes and that biodegradation had already intensively occurred in the on site source area post remedial results indicate a significant decrease in total voc concentration up to 99 and the predominance of ethane and ethene this is a clear indication that the intensive treatment and post thermal biodegradation had been performed extremely well in the attenuation and transformation of voc to ethene and ethane fig 6a table 2 of si nearby on site monitoring wells pmg 002 pmg 004 pm 027fa pm 031fa pm 044f and pm 062f fig 3 presented similar patterns to well pmg 01 the 2019 results for pm 045f also in this region collected after the pilot remediation test showed a large amount of ethene 5820 μg l table 2 of si indicating an almost complete transformation of voc to final products of biodegradation the 2019 data showed ethene is not present and small amount of tce 1 1 dca and 1 1 2 tca and a small increase in vc and 1 1 dca fig 6a table 1 si this pattern is possibly due to a minor rebound and or side effect of the thermal and bioremediation treatments the molar fraction data from the groundwater of wells located directly downgradient from the off site source well pm 060f for example pm 051f pm 058f pm 062f pmi 09 pmi 010 pm 032f pmi 07 presents mixtures with variable compositions of chloroethene and chloroethane compounds together with ethene and ethane fig 6a and b table 2 of si these results suggest the existence of degradation processes and an evidence of a commingled plume situation a significant reduction in voc mass is observed in wells pm 058f and pm 062f in the 2019 data with proportional increase of the final product ethane which is likely to be related to the effect of the nearby thermal and bioremediation concerning the wells located further downgradient from both source zones for example pm 041f pmi 02 pmi 04 pm 052f pm 53f pmp 08 pp 02 and pp 05 they presented variable voc composition with predominance of a mixture of chlorinated ethane and ethene by products fig 6a and b these signatures suggest that potentially they could have originated from off site and or on site sources and were also under the influence of biodegradation this may have been further induced previously by the operation of the pump and treat system at several locations throughout this region after thermal and bio remediation typically the concentrations decreased and proportions of breakdown products increased mainly in the wells located in the weathered rock soil targeted by bio remediation and the soft weathered rock geological unit such as pm 041f pmi 04 and pm 053f fig 3 fig 6a and b no appreciable changes in concentration and molar fraction composition were observed between 2016 and 2019 data fig 6b in the shallowest and deepest port of the monitoring nest pp 02 located in the underlying fresh rock geological unit and further downgradient from the voc sources fig 1 it is possible it will take a longer period of time to see the effect of remediation treatment due to the distance or this also could be explained with the potential existence of areas in the bedrock with less connectivity to the remediated areas or the possible existence of another source area the mixed compound sources and generalized pattern of intensively biodegraded compounds hampered the interpretation of single compound distributions pce a chlorinated ethene parent compound identified predominantly only in the off site groundwater at well pm 60f had extremely limited presence in all downgradient wells despite wide occurrence of its biodegradation products 1 2 dca was identified throughout the whole study area including at both source areas most impacted wells and it was previously used on site therefore 1 2 dca could have been a chlorinated ethane parent compound however it could have been produced by the degradation of other products such as 1 1 2 tca that was identified only as a minor compound at specific wells the plumes of 1 2 dca identified in the 2016 and 2019 campaigns are presented respectively in fig 7a and b the 2016 plume does not clearly distinguish the source areas however the 1 2 dca distribution indicates the contribution of the off site and on site to the downgradient areas the 2019 plumes present a strong reduction in size and concentrations of 1 2 dca with no indications of plume displacement or rebound effects mainly in the on site source area targeted by thermal and bioremediation treatments indicating this source is no longer contributing 1 2 dca to the downgradient groundwater the study area included complexity issues posed by the close location less than 40 m of the source areas and limited information about the off site source area in addition the direction of groundwater flow was previously probably influenced by the former pump treat system that operated at pp 02 pp 05 and shallower levels including near pmi 02 this configuration see conceptual model in fig 2 plus the voc distribution and signatures fig 6 suggest that a mixing zone existed downgradient from both source areas this mixing area created commingled plumes among compounds present at one or both source areas such as pce and 1 2 dca in addition to a mixture of several degraded chlorinated ethane and ethene compounds the fraction related to each source varied throughout the commingled plumes however the 2019 results indicated that the on site source was intensively treated therefore it is expected that the on site contribution to the commingled plumes was reduced and possibly ceased this was also confirmed later in 2019 and 2020 by several monitoring campaigns of the expanded well network in addition to soil and vapour sampling studies which are not described in this paper 4 3 voc isotopic characterization the carbon and chlorine isotopic results in δ are presented respectively in tables 1 and 2 the baseline 2016 δ13c isotope results in groundwater present δ13c values of 17 5 and 1 8 for pce and 1 2 dca respectively in the off site source well pm 60f table 1 in the on site source groundwater of well pmg 01 a δ13c value of 10 3 was observed for 1 2 dca while pce was not analysed due to low detection of this compound 1 1 μg l table 2 of si these δ13c values are systematically more enriched isotopically compared with the values reported for commercial products that range between 23 and 33 for pce beneteau et al 1999 and between 26 5 and 29 5 for 1 2 dca palau et al 2014 schmidt et al 2014 franke et al 2017 these isotopic patterns plus the presence of by products indicated that biodegradation has been an active attenuation process for chlorinated compounds in the source areas prior to thermal and full scale bioremediation the δ13c results for potential parent compounds 1 1 2 2 teca and 1 1 2 tca are available for a limited number of wells mainly near the off site source area but are all lower than values identified in the same wells for 1 2 dca which is another evidence 1 2 dca is not a product of their degradation a wide range in isotopic baseline 2016 composition is observed for pce near or downgradient the off site source area with δ13c results varying between 20 7 and 7 9 and its potential by products range between 26 5 and 3 9 for tce 24 1 and 9 8 for 1 2 dce 31 3 and 5 5 for vc 22 7 and 4 6 for ethene and 16 6 and 9 6 for ethane table 1 the results are in general coherent with a reductive dechlorination pathway for pce hunkeler et al 1999 abe et al 2009 for 1 2 dca during the 2016 campaign a wide range of enriched δ13c values of 6 5 and 20 is observed near and downgradient from both sources indicating this compound has been affected by a high degree of enrichment with different potential degradation pathways and origins as discussed later on in this chapter the data collected in 2019 indicate δ13c isotopic results with further enriched values mainly in groundwater located in the area of influence of bioremediation and thermal treatment as further discussed at the end of this chapter for example well pmg 004 located near the area of the on site source fig 3 presented δ13c values of 14 5 for tce 3 1 for cis dce 0 7 for vc 45 2 for 1 2 dca 10 9 for ethane and 2 for ethene table 1 in 2019 chlorine isotopes for pce and its degradation products were sampled for the first time the δ37cl results for pce coherently with δ13c results indicate lower values near the off site source area between 1 8 and 0 9 and further enriched values between 2 8 and 4 6 in downgradient wells under the influence of remediation isotopic mass balance results over distance from the most upgradient well pm 60f near the offsite source area are presented in fig 8 tables 3 and 4 of si the results for 2016 fig 8a indicate high variations both for chlorinated ethenes δ13cce between 28 7 and 5 7 and ethanes δ13cca between 10 8 and 20 0 higher enriched values are identified mainly near the onsite source area 30 to 40 m and intermediate values further downgradient within the commingled plume this suggests potential mixture of source signatures and or further degradation from both chlorinated ethenes and ethanes towards none chlorinated compounds such as ethene and ethane and or other degradation pathways and or variations related to the different hydrogeological units the results for 2019 fig 8b indicate similar results with increases noted at a closer distance approximately 20 m and higher ranges for δ13cce between 29 3 and 2 9 and δ13cca between 4 3 and 40 9 these changes are likely to be related to remediation effects which enhanced degradation and isotopic enrichment 4 3 1 1 2 dca biodegradation pathways the by products of biodegradation of 1 2 dca potentially can include vc via dehydrohalogenation ethene via dihaloelimination and chloroethane via hydrogenolysis followed by ethane hunkeler et al 2002 palau et al 2017a and 2017b the 2016 and 2019 results indicate chloroethane was identified near detections limits or not detected excepting well pmg 03 in 2019 which presented a concentration of 2190 μg l table 2 of si these results tend to discard chloroethane production as the main degradation pathway for 1 2 dca a further insight about the origin of vc ethene and ethane can be done analysing the baseline 2016 tables 1 and 2 of si concentration and isotope data for the groundwater representative of the off site and in situ source areas for example the groundwater in the off site well pm 60f is characterized by a 1 2 dca concentration of 4640 μg l vc at 3210 μg l ethene at 2090 μg l and ethane at 798 μg l δ13c results values indicate 1 2 dca values of 1 8 vc at 18 3 ethene at 22 7 and ethane 16 6 the enriched isotopic values observed for ethene and ethane suggests both gases have been affected by biodegradation and the non presence of chloroethane indicated that ethane is a by product of biodegradation of ethene as discussed previously this is a well were vc is likely to have originated from the degradation of the parent compound pce and its by products the highly enriched δ13c for 1 2 dca and the high concentration of ethene suggests that 1 2 dca was biodegrading to ethene the groundwater in the in situ source well pmg 01 is characterized by a 1 2 dca concentration of 32 500 μg l vc at 8900 μg l ethene at 23700 μg l and ethane at 5 μg l δ13c results show values for 1 2 dca of 10 3 vc at 31 3 ethene at 2 5 and ethane not analysed due to none detectable concentrations these results indicated that vc has been accumulating and has not been transformed to ethene which is likely to be a direct biodegradation product of 1 2 dca ethane was not detected in this groundwater confirming it was not a main biodegradation product of 1 2 dca concerning the fate of the gases the isotopic mass balance results fig 8 and the range with highly enriched δ13c values observed in 2016 table 1 for ethene 22 7 to 4 6 and ethane 16 6 to 9 6 indicate that further transformation of the parent compounds to non toxic compounds have occurred and these gases have also been affected by biodegradation 4 3 2 carbon isotope data for 1 2 dca prior and post remediation since 1 2 dca is one of the main compounds present in the on site and off site voc source areas its carbon isotope data will be used to evaluate the signatures throughout the study area including at the comingling plume located downgradient from the sources 1 2 dca is also considered a potential parent compound as suggested by the on site history and isotopes results table 1 which simplifies the interpretation of the isotopic signatures as their values shall not be influenced by fractionation during previous degradation steps fig 9a and b presents the isotopic results on map and proposes general plume zonings based on the combination of the lines of evidence presented in this paper hydrogeology geochemistry voc and isotopic signatures a large isotopic difference is observed in 1 2 dca 2016 results fig 9a in the sources areas which are characterized by a δ13c value of 1 8 in well pm 060f representing the off site source compared to a δ13c value of 10 3 in well pmg 01 representing the on site source a lower δ13c value of 6 5 than the 1 2 dca at well pm 060f located in the weathered rock soil unit was observed in the nearby well pm 51f located in the shallower sandy deposit unit possibly due to source and or degradation heterogeneities highly enriched δ13c values of 8 6 pm 031fa 15 1 pm 027fa 14 9 pmg 002 and 20 0 pmg 003 are also observed in 1 2 dca in groundwater of other wells tapping the organic clay and the sand unit located most near the on site source area most impacted well pmg 01 then groundwater in wells tapping the soft weathered rocks located east perpendicular to recorded groundwater flow directions of the on site source and downgradient from the off site source show lower δ13c values of 2 5 pm 058f 3 0 pm 062f and 2 8 pm 032f for 1 2 dca fig 9a these results at least 5 6 below the minimum value mentioned above for the on site nearby source area wells suggest none or less on site source influence over an off site plume that presents progressive isotopic enrichment due to degradation as it moves downgradient further downgradient from the two sources areas all δ13c 1 2 dca values fig 9a are within the range of 2 8 to 3 0 apart from 4 0 and 7 0 at pp 05 55 7 m and pp 05 82 5 m which are respectively 4 6 and 1 6 lower than the minimum value identified at the on site most nearby source area wells this suggests mixing of plumes of both sources in a comingled plume configuration with predominance of δ13c values that are more like the signature of the off site source most impacted wells pm 060f and pm 051f and their downgradient wells pm 058f pm 060f and pm 032f because of the high rate of degradation caused by the thermal and bioremediation the δ13c 1 2 dca in the treatment areas presented further enrichment in 2019 compared to 2016 the 2019 isotope data in groundwater in the treatment area fig 3 show δ13c values ranging between 24 7 pmi 09 and 45 2 pmg 04 at the off site source area wells that were not targeted by thermal or bioremediation the δ13c 1 2 dca presented a lower level of enrichment 7 4 at pm 060f and 3 7 at pm 051f the first well pm 058f located at east of the on site source also shows a highly enriched δ13c value of 18 fig 9b which is correlated with a large reduction in 1 2 dca concentration fig 6a table 2 of si these δ13c 1 2 dca enrichments out of the targeted treatment areas are probably related to positive degradation side effects of the nearby thermal and bioremediation related to influence of temperature and toc increases the δ13c 1 2 dca in the groundwater further east of the on site source area presents values of 4 1 well pmi 07 and 4 8 pmi 10 which are close to that detected in the 2016 campaign for the nearby well 2 8 at pm 032f this confirms this part of the study area was not targeted neither intensively affected by the thermal and bioremediation treatments in addition the values detected in this region are again most like the off site source area wells signatures pm 060f and pm 051f the downgradient groundwater from both sources along the comingled plume show similar isotopic pattern than in 2016 apart from increases at bedrock wells pm 041f from 1 3 to 14 7 and less significantly at pp 05 30 8 m from 2 3 to 4 3 and pp 02 79 3 m from 0 0 to 1 8 as groundwater flow presents high velocity in the fractured rock aquifer this isotopic variation may be related to the δ13c enrichment observed in the area of the on site source thermal treatment and nearby bioremediation activities this is also supported by the geochemical variations evidences see section 4 1 and hydrogeological testing hart et al 2021 the 2019 carbon isotope data similarly to the 2016 campaign indicates the downgradient commingle plume presents predominance of values that are more similar to the off site source signature reinforced by the on site source thermal intensive treatment and isotopic enrichment 4 3 3 dual carbon and chlorine isotope patterns dual carbon chlorine isotope results for chlorinated ethenes of the 2019 campaign are plotted in fig 10 together with plotted average lines and equations including slopes calculated for the data they can be used to support differentiation between processes governing pce degradation kuder et al 2013 badin et al 2016 it is important to highlight that pce was identified as a major compound only in the off site source area near well pm 060f however cannot be discarded that other pce sources exist mainly in the off site areas that were not investigated this could be an explanation for pmi 10 lower δ13c and δ37cl pce results tables 1 and 2 and fig 10 as wells as source and or degradation heterogeneities the groundwater with the highest temperature indicative of thermal treatment and methane indicative of bio remediation detections were highlighted in order to support evaluation of eventual processes induced by remediation the wells that presented higher δ13c and δ37cl values correlate to those with higher methane concentrations suggesting higher degradation levels there are some isotope data in groundwater such as wells pmg 04 and pm 045f locate near the on site source and thermal remediation area that are out of the general linear pattern shown by the other wells and present more intensive carbon enrichment their distribution potentially is related to a different pattern and could be explained if existed another pce source not identified with different original signature carbon enriched another potential explanation could be a thermal induced degradation pathway related to this type of heating which caused in addition to inducing bio degradation volatilization not expected to cause high δ13c fractionation according to slater et al 2000 and hydrolysis to be further researched and characterized for isotopic fractionation the evaluation of these hypothesis is restricted due to uncertainties related to the initial sources content off site source area investigation lack of pre remediation chlorine isotopic results and limited references concerning isotopic fractionation associated with thermal induced degradation badin et al 2016 murray et al 2019 nonetheless the overall results confirm that carbon and chlorine isotopic fractionation occurred due to both bio remediation and thermal treatment by stimulating bio degradation and potentially via another process such as hydrolysis to be further investigated in order to further evaluate isotopic fractionation trends the obtained dual c cl slopes values for the combined data set were compared to other field studies and laboratory experiments results compiled and complemented by murray et al 2019 data have been reported for oxidation and reductive dechlorination pathways both biotic and abiotic however non for combined thermal and bio remediation for pce the slope obtained in the current study 2 1 falls within the range widely reported for biotic reductive dechlorination 0 7 to 3 8 for tce the obtained slope 2 5 also falls within the range widely reported for biotic reductive dechlorination 2 3 4 8 for cis 1 2 dce the identified slope 1 6 is significantly lower than the ranges reported for biotic reductive dechlorination 4 5 to 17 8 and abiotic degradation 3 1 to 5 0 however fits within the range of 1 5 to 3 0 reported for combined biotic and abiotic degradation processes for vc references were not identified and therefore comparison was not possible this overall evaluation is another evidence that isotopic fractionation occurred due to biotic reductive dechlorination it also suggests there is a need for further studies characterizing isotopic fractionation during vocs degradation by thermally induced processes mainly hydrolysis to assess potential specific characteristics of this degradation pathway 5 conclusions chlorinated ethanes and ethenes isotopic analyses in groundwater and hydrogeochemical results from a former industrial area in sao paulo brazil were used to evaluate source areas and commingled plumes both before and after thermal and bioremediation treatments in weathered fractured bedrock the δ13c groundwater baseline isotopic results 2016 indicated clear differences for chlorinated ethanes and ethenes signatures and mass balances throughout the study area the main well of the recently identified off site source area well pm 60f was dominated by chlorinated ethenes and presented the typical reductive dichlorination trend with δ13c values of 17 5 for pce 21 3 for tce 16 3 for cis dce and 18 3 for vc a relative high concentration of 1 2 dca is found in this groundwater characterized by a δ13c of 1 8 a δ13c value of 6 2 for 1 2 dca was found in a nearby well pm 51f which is characterized by much lower concentration of chlorinated ethenes and higher concentration of 1 2 dca vc and ethene the on site source area wells were dominated by chlorinated ethanes and much more enriched δ13c values 8 6 to 20 0 for 1 2 dca than the off site source area wells the observed 1 2 dca large isotope difference between source areas and its presence throughout the study were favourable conditions to evaluate the hypothesis of the existence commingled plumes intermediate δ13c values for 1 2 dca and mixed voc concentrations were identified in wells downgradient from both source areas consistent with commingled plumes formation the wells downgradient from the source areas presented variable content of degradation products under favourable hydrogeochemical conditions for biotic reductive dechlorination of chlorinated ethanes and dihaloelimination for 1 2 dca the existence of commingled plumes were also supported by the proximity of the source areas less than 40 m and hydrogeological characteristics including high connectivity between geological units and potential past groundwater converging flow directions when pumping activities occurred hart et al 2021 the δ13c isotopic results from the post remediation campaign 2019 were consistent with the baseline results however presented additional isotopic enrichments mainly near the treatment areas the hydrogeochemical evaluation confirmed that the biotic reductive dechlorination conditions were enhanced by both the bio remediation and thermal treatment the temperature increases induced natural carbon solubilisation and temporally reached microbial optimum levels around 40 c horst et al 2018 leite et al 2021 this was also evaluated with dual carbon chlorine isotope slopes for the chlorinated ethenes which indicated that most enriched values were identified at wells with higher methane concentrations indicative of toc bio degradation and mainly for δ13c at wells where temperature had increased due to thermal treatment the slopes were compared with available reference values and were typically coherent with ranges reported for biotic reductive dechlorination pathway kuder et al 2013 badin et al 2016 degradation products were also detected both for biotic reductive dechlorination and hydrolysis pathways chloride increase and ph decrease matching voc concentrations reductions the results of this study allowed further characterization of the chlorinated ethane and ethene source areas and confirm the formation of commingled plumes in a complex setting they were consistent with the temporal conceptual model proposed by hart et al 2021 and also suggest there is a need for further studies characterizing isotopic fractionation during voc degradation by thermally induced processes mainly hydrolysis to assess potential specific characteristics of this degradation pathway these results and conclusions potentially can be used as a scientific basis for other studies in areas with similar characteristics such

1344,chlorinated ethanes and ethenes isotopic analyses in groundwater and hydrogeochemical results from a former industrial area in sao paulo brazil were used to confirm the existence and allow further characterization of source areas and their commingled plumes both before and after thermal and bioremediation treatments prior to full scale remediation a recently identified off site source area with unknown history and limited access for further intrusive works presented lower δ13c values 6 5 to 1 8 for 1 2 dca than the downgradient on site source area 8 6 to 20 0 intermediate δ13c values for 1 2 dca were identified further downgradient from the sources within commingled plumes patterns the isotope and concentration results show the typical degradation patterns associated with biotic reductive dechlorination for chlorinated ethenes and dihaloelimination for 1 2 dca results following remediation treatments show further levels of isotopic enrichment for chlorinated ethenes and chlorinated ethanes in the tropically weathered and deeper fractured bedrock gneisses groundwater hydrogeochemical results isotopic mass balance and carbon chlorine isotope slopes data are coherent with remediation treatment and a complex commingled plume setting the results of this study confirmed the temporal conceptual model proposed by hart et al 2021 and identified the need for further studies to evaluate isotopic dynamics under thermal remediation including thermal induced hydrolysis processes keywords commingled plumes isotopic fingerprinting chlorinated ethanes and ethenes thermal remediation bioremediation 1 introduction chlorinated ethenes and ethanes are some of the most frequent contaminants detected in groundwater systems they have typically been used as solvents within industrial production processes and mainly during the second half of the last century they infiltrated the ground due to spills or improper residue disposal characteristics such as high density and solubility favoured them being mobilized to deep levels and transported with groundwater over long distances making remediation very challenging parker 2007 hunkeler et al 2011 barbosa 2019 murray et al 2019 multiple source areas with plumes under pumping influence of supply wells often exist at industrial regions which add complexity to the characterization of chlorinated compounds plumes parker 2007 l apiccirella 2009 lojkasek lima et al 2012 bertolo 2017 furthermore groundwater may be contaminated within a commingled plume configuration mixing contaminants from more than one source area potentially including unidentified polluters management of such complex scenarios including remediation strategies requires investigation using multiple lines of evidence and a setup of robust conceptual models kresic and mikszewski 2013 itrc 2017 hart et al 2021 traditional contaminant composition and concentration data when evaluated alone can be of limited use for the forensic determination of chlorinated ethenes and ethanes sources due to the effect of other processes such as dilution and degradation nijenhuis et al 2013 in addition complex areas typically present higher levels of uncertainties for example within a commingled plume scenario itrc 2017 various other tools may be employed together such as high resolution drilling tracer testing microbial evaluation and compound specific isotopic analysis hunkeler et al 2004 blessing et al 2009 eccarius et al 2012 lojkasek lima et al 2012 nijenhuis et al 2013 kaown et al 2016 njdep new jersey department of environmental protection 2017 the potential to fingerprint chlorinated organic compounds in source areas was first suggested by van warmerdam et al 1995 based on the isotopic analysis of specific synthetic chlorinated organic values for different producers the number of publications on forensic studies using the isotope tool in contaminated areas is increasing however often limited by legal aspects and confidentiality agreements philp 2015 teixeira and abreu 2018 the isotopic signatures can change over time due to natural or induced degradation processes however isotopic analyses and mass balances can assist in recognizing the fractionation patterns and pathways of degradation a guide for assessing biodegradation with single or multiple isotopes including several studies was published by usepa 2008 and confirms its vast potential in recent years the database for the application of the dual and triple isotope approach has continuously expanded including a large amount of contaminants degradation pathways and other complexity factors shouakar stash et al 2011 palau et al 2014 palau et al 2017a palau et al 2017b gafni et al 2018 torrentó et al 2021 regarding the evaluation of thermal remediation processes by using isotope tools there is a limited amount of publications badin et al 2016 and murray et al 2019 evaluated their effects at a site in denmark based on the evolution of isotopes for tetrachloroethylene pce degradation pathways the metropolitan region of sao paulo brazil presents a high potential for the existence of unidentified commingled plumes in its aquifers mainly in the historic extensive industrial neighbourhoods the public water supply system uses surface water reservoirs however it is supplemented by private wells which are estimated to be beyond 12 000 fusp 2009 comprehensive analytical monitoring data of the supply wells is limited however contamination with chlorinated solvents compounds and several management challenges have been identified and characterized hart et al 2007 l apiccirella 2009 fanti et al 2017 bertolo 2017 lojkasek lima 2018 barbosa 2019 hart et al 2021 the study area of this paper is located in the metropolitan region of sao paulo and presents a long industrial history and intensive groundwater use of the fractured crystalline bedrock aquifer until impacts by organic compounds were identified in bedrock wells for approximately 15 years it was understood this was related to an on site source where chlorinated ethanes predominated with lower content of chlorinated ethenes then an off site source area where chlorinated ethenes predominated with lower content of ethanes was initially identified with a limited number of boreholes near the upgradient boundary of the adjacent industry the source area extent history and plumes were unknown and access was restricted due to existing infra structure and activities this indicated there was potential for commingling with on site plumes in addition to limitations for further intrusive works the main objectives of this study were to further confirm chlorinated ethane and ethene source areas and characterize commingled plumes distribution and degradation before and after thermal and bioremediation treatment at the on site source area hydrogeochemical approaches including compound specific stable isotope analyses csia of chlorinated ethenes and ethanes were selected and applied a dual carbon chlorine isotope approach was also used to contribute to a better understanding of the chlorinated compounds degradation pathways 2 study site description 2 1 hydrogeology and temporal conceptual site the study area was a former chemical industry within the metropolitan region of sao paulo brazil see fig 1 over almost a century the region was mainly of industrial use but within the last two decades it is transforming into a more commercial and residential use the research area is in the alluvial plain of a river which is historically subject to flooding the total annual precipitation rate is around 1400 mm with the highest monthly precipitation rate up to 300 mm in january historic annual average temperature is approximately 20 c groundwater was extracted for the industrial process from the deep fractured bedrock aquifer by the operation of two on site groundwater supply wells pp 02 and pp 05 open borehole in the fresh rock and with a total depth of 250 m when traces of chlorinated solvents were identified these wells were operated within a pump treat remediation strategy and more recently turned into discrete multilevel wells named by the supply well name followed by the screen maximum depth as part of the monitoring network a temporal conceptual model was developed by hart et al 2021 after a review of the long term management results and contamination behaviour that occurred over time at this study site which is presented in fig 2 all the geological data were classified based on humid tropical soils and presented in hart et al 2021 the following units were identified from top to bottom fill materials alluvial sediments weathered rock soil and bedrock gneissic rock this unit was subdivided into soft weathered rock hard weathered rock and fresh rock this region presents two main aquifers units hirata and ferreira 2001 the cenozoic sedimentary deposits of the sao paulo basin with supply wells presenting a specific capacity of 0 48m3 h m and the underlying crystalline bedrock with supply wells presenting a specific capacity of 0 91 m3 h m the crystalline bedrock aquifer is subdivided into two highly heterogeneous and anisotropic horizons the weathered rock with dual porosity and the fresh rock with fracture porosity the phreatic groundwater surface is typically identified within 2 m below ground surface in the study area presenting a hydraulic gradient of approximately 1 groundwater flow velocities and directions were calculated for all the geological units above the bedrock and they range from less than 1 m to 11 m year with predominance towards south and southeast fig 1 within the bedrock groundwater flow velocity and direction were found to be highly heterogeneous and dependent on specific fracture setups recharge processes and eventual influence of pumping 2 2 investigation and remediation since 2000 the area has been subjected to various contaminated land investigation and remediation actions mainly excavation works and a pump treat system at pp 02 and pp 05 and shallower wells including near pmi 02 area fig 1 one chlorinated solvent source area was identified on site with a high predominance of 1 2 dichloroethane 1 2 dca a compound that was previously used on site as pure product for industrial purposes and lower concentrations of several chloroethane and chloroethene compounds by 2014 soil and groundwater quality had improved due to the above mentioned remediation actions mainly within the fill material unit concentrations at some deeper wells had not achieved remediation targets while a high resolution investigation including membrane interface probe mip confirmed persistence of anomalies in the on site source area at that time within the underlying sedimentary dark organic clay unit fig 2 its highest concentrations were typically detected near the later installed monitoring well pmg 01 fig 1 within soil and groundwater approximately 75 mg l for total volatile organic compounds voc and 32 mg l for 1 2 dca therefore the management strategy was revised to incorporate further investigations to diminish uncertainties an evaluation of new available technologies and a revision of the conceptual model in 2015 and 2016 new investigations and a localized bio remediation test beside pm 044 and pm 045 which can be identified in fig 1 were performed an off site area near the upgradient boundary of an off site active industrial area with restricted access presented unexpected high concentrations in soil between 2 4 m and 11 8 m deep mainly in fill materials and weathered rock soils and the associated groundwater these anomalies were not fully delineated laterally or further upgradient and the impact origin was considered unknown this area was located approximately 40 m northeast from the main on site source area well pmg 01 and in between them no major impacts were identified during mip soil and groundwater investigations the new investigations found the upgradient well pm 060f in the weathered rock soil unit presented the highest voc concentrations and a high predominance of pce with lower concentrations of several chloroethane and chloroethene compounds the high concentrations in soil and groundwater approximately 150 mg l for total voc and 60 mg l for pce within approximately 30 of pce solubility concentration limit suggested the potential existence of dense non aqueous phase liquid dnapl in this area this together with other lines of evidence such as spatial apparent discontinuity depths estimated flows high resolution investigation and geochemical signatures was considered indicative of the existence of a nearby unknown off site source area and a commingled plume configuration in order to further evaluate this understanding without new intrusive off site works the investigations followed with the isotopic studies carried out before and after new full scale remediation works discussed later on in this paper a new remediation strategy was defined and implemented on site between 2016 and the first semester of 2018 fig 3 electro thermal remediation was applied between october 2016 and may 2017 to treat the whole on site source area delineated based on detailed soil and groundwater analytical results within the organic clay level of the alluvial sediments unit temperatures were increased and stabilized around 100 c over approximately 4 months in order to mobilize contaminant via solubilisation and volatilization processes followed by liquid and vapour phase recovery via negatively pressurized systems temperature variation can potentially enhance or limit bioremediation temperatures in the mesophilic range between 25 and 40 c have found to result in higher contaminant bioavailability and biodegradability with very limited bacterial populations above 60 c leite et al 2021 heating also induces hydrolysis which is a process of direct destruction of the compounds for the thermal hydrolysis process of 1 2 dca the expected equation is presented below palau et al 2017a resulting in production of ethylene glycol and chloride with ph decrease c 2 h 4 cl 2 2h 2 o c 2 h 6 o 2 2h 2cl monitoring of the applied thermal remediation indicated that targets were achieved and 176 kg of chlorinated solvents were recovered 99 5 in vapour phase and the remaining as liquid phase it was also estimated based on initial final mass calculations temperatures measurements and theoretical assumptions that thermal works had induced the degradation of additional 491 kg via hydrolysis pathway mainly for 1 2 dca followed by 1 1 dca the new remediation strategy also included bioremediation that was applied mainly between 2017 and the first semester of 2018 to treat the on site source area associated plumes identified mainly within the eluvial soil and weathered soil geological units the process was based on the promotion of biotic reductive dechlorination via injection of a carbon source molasses into a network of dedicated remediation wells during thermal treatment this substrate was injected at further downgradient areas and once heating ceased injections took place throughout the study area including beneath the heated horizon the bedrock levels typically less impacted were not subject to direct heating or injections however indirect positive effects related to the remediation at shallower levels were expected 3 materials and methods 3 1 sampling strategy the site monitoring well network included more than 100 sampling locations and were sampled every semester or more intensively during some remediation works at specific locations for groundwater chemical analyses a group of selected wells were sampled for groundwater isotopic analyses in 2016 after the 2015 localized bio remediation pilot test and prior to the thermal and full scale bio remediation and in 2019 two years after the end of the thermal remediation and one year after the last molasses injection the wells were selected fig 1 in order to include spatially representative locations source areas and the plumes along the groundwater flow system in total 28 different wells were sampled in both or either in the first or the second campaigns some wells were sampled for isotopes only in the 2019 because they were installed after the 2016 campaign and others removed due to the thermal treatment the groundwater sampling procedures followed the low flow method protocols usepa 2017 due to the thermal remediation an additional procedure was performed in the 2019 campaign when groundwater temperature was identified more than 10 c above initial background levels in these cases a cooling system was added externally without contact to the low flow closed lines in order to reduce temperatures to initial background levels before groundwater samples collection samples were stored and preserved following laboratories instructions then immediately labelled refrigerated within ice boxes and sent with chain of custodies for analyses samples were followed to guarantee minimum possible transport time 3days in the case of the international laboratory in order to facilitate data interpretation the wells were classified within two major groups porous group related to locations where intergranular porosity dominates which included wells installed in the fill material alluvial sediments and weathered rock soil geological units groundwater in most of these wells including the on site source area around pmg 01 fig 3 was targeted for remediation the off site main source well pm 060f fig 3 is also part of this group but is located up gradient and was not a remediation target the second type bedrock group is related to locations where fracture porosity may predominate and included those wells installed in the deeper geological units soft weathered rock hard weathered rock or fresh rock 3 2 analyses groundwater chemical analyses were conducted for approximately 70 standard chlorinated voc plus degradation products ethene and ethane the following hydrogeochemical parameters were analysed as part of the thermal and bioremediation evaluation oxidation reduction potential orp temperature electrical conductivity ph dissolved oxygen sulphate total organic carbon toc sulphide total alkalinity chloride and methane some parameters such as orp were not always monitored at wells that presented high temperatures due to the risk of damaging the equipment some wells samples were also eventually analysed for dissolved iron dissolved manganese nitrate and ammonium nitrogen all analyses were conducted following united states of america standard analytical and quality control assurance procedures and methods e g epa 8260c for voc in the laboratories located in sao paulo of the international company merieux nutrisciences isotopic analysis were conducted for the chlorinated compounds and degradation products most typically identified at the site pce trichloroethene tce cis 1 2 dichloroethene cis 1 2 dce vinyl chloride vc 1 1 2 2 tetrachloroethane 1 1 2 2 teca 1 1 2 trichloroethane 1 1 2 tca 1 2 dca 1 1 dichloroethene 1 1 dce 1 1 dichloroethane 1 1 dca ethene and ethane chloroethane is also a potential chlorinated ethane degradation product of 1 2 dca however was not isotopically analysed due to none detectable or low concentrations during the first and second sampling campaigns carbon isotopes were analysed at the organic geochemistry laboratory of the university of oklahoma usa during the second campaign chlorine isotopic analyses for chlorinated ethenes were added to the analytical plan and were performed at the same laboratory quality control and assurance measures were applied including sample custody traceability controls control samples and duplicates analyses the analytical precision was calculated as 0 5 or lower for all carbon and chlorine isotope analyses detection limit was typically 1 μg l depending on compound response for each sample results were reported in standard delta notation following methods described by usepa 2008 and laboratory internal procedures standards were reported to be commercially obtained calibrated to the appropriate international isotope scale vpdb vsmow or smoc or developed using high purity e g acs grade specimens based on off line isotope ratio analysis national or international certifications systems specifically for compound specific isotopic analyses did not exist that could be applied to certify the laboratory the laboratory internal procedures for isotopic analyses indicate that volatile compounds were extracted from water using a purge and trap apparatus pt and then transferred to a gas chromatograph gc and a mass spectrometer for low molecular weight compounds including chlorinated ethenes the pt transfer line is connected to a polar phase column analytes eluting from the transfer line are trapped using a cryogenic focuser prior to being transferred to a main gc column for target compound separation for carbon the separated analytes are directed through a thermal conversion reactor and converted individually to pulses of surrogate gas product co2 for isotope ratio determination via an isotope ratio monitoring mass spectrometer irms the chlorine ratios are determined without thermal conversion using a standard quadrupole mass spectrometer qms operated within a single ion mode the ratio of 37cl 35cl is calculated with the results of scanning two cl bearing mass fragments with identical structure first one containing 35cl and no 37cl and the second containing a single 37cl 3 3 isotopic mass balance isotopic mass balances were applied for total chlorinated ethanes and ethenes to further evaluate the complete sequential degradation pathways and influence of multiple sources hunkeler et al 1999 nijenhuis et al 2013 badin et al 2016 murray et al 2019 this was applied for each sampling point and taking into account sequential degradation substances for which both isotope and concentrations values were available the isotopic values of the total chlorinated ethenes δ13cce pce tce cis dce and vc and chlorinated ethanes δ13cca 1 1 2 tca 1 2 dca was calculated by multiplying the molar concentration of each compound ci with its respective carbon isotope signature δ13ci adding all contributions and dividing by the total molar concentration cce eq 1 nijenhuis et al 2013 1 δ 13 c ce c i δ 13 c i c ce the error associated with the isotopic mass balance can be calculated by error propagation badin et al 2016 however uncertainties include several factors analytical errors limited amount of analysis multiple sources different hydrogeological units and multiple degradation pathways towards ethene and ethane therefore not included in the isotope mass balance 4 results and discussions 4 1 evolution of hydrogeochemical conditions the hydrogeochemical results for the campaigns that included isotopic analyses 2016 and 2019 are presented as supplementary material table 1 of si the hydrogeochemical results prior to remediation for the porous and bedrock group wells presented in general reducing anaerobic conditions results after remediation typically did not indicate major changes in orp however mainly for the porous group wells sulphate decreased and methane increased for example at the on site source well pmg 01 between 2016 and 2019 orp changed from 107 1 to 109 0 mv sulphate decreased from 110 0 to below 5 0 mg l methane increased from 7 4 to 30 5 mg l in 2019 two years after the thermal treatment both porous and bedrock group wells typically presented temperatures more than 3 c higher than in 2016 with most different measurements identified at porous well pm 044f from 21 8 to 32 0 c and bedrock pp 02 79 3 m from 19 8 to 25 4 c more steady conditions for all of these parameters were identified at the off site source area well pm 60f which was not targeted for remediation the bedrock group wells were also not directly targeted for remediation however hydrogeochemical changes were identified such as temperature and methane increases sulphate decreases table 1 of si and confirmed the influence of thermal and bioremediation this was possibly enhanced by the groundwater downwards vertical flow pattern and aquifer high connectivity previously that were noted during hydrogeological tests hart et al 2021 the overall hydrogeochemical results indicate that the thermal and bioremediation treatment promoted a long term lasting effect in the targeted and underlying areas including temperature increase and enhancement of sulphate reducing and methanogenesis conditions an example of groundwater time series measurements during the thermal treatment is presented in fig 4 the well pmg 01 was screened in the sedimentary dark organic clay level and located approximately 2 m from an electro heating device during the heating period voc total mass calculated adding all detectable voc not ethane or ethane decreased likely due to both hydrolysis and volatilization processes chloride increased and ph decreased as expected for the hydrolysis process toc concentrations increased possibly due to a solubilisation process of natural carbon mainly from the organic clay layer in addition it is noticeable that methane concentrations decreased during this period possible due to volatilization and ceasing of natural biodegradation activity sulphate presented slight increase which also suggests that limited biodegradation activity was taking place after the heating treatment period temperature gradually decreased and the trend of decreasing voc continued at slower rate sulphate decreased and methane increased which supports that biodegradation of respectively voc and toc returned possibly stimulated by residual temperature nearer microbial optimum levels around 40 c horst et al 2018 leite et al 2021 an example of groundwater time series of measurements during the localized bioremediation pilot test is presented in fig 5 this test was conducted in 2015 followed by the isotopic 2016 sampling campaign and after by the full scale bio and thermal remediation works the well pm 048f fig 3 was screened in the weathered soil unit orp was not included in this figure as the available data suggested limited changes around 155 0mv this well initially presented some of the highest contaminant concentrations of the on site source area and was located approximately 1 m from an injection well later removed together with well pm 048f due to the thermal works results indicated that approximately 3 months after the molasses injection event voc toc sulphate concentrations and ph decreased while methane concentration increased chloride concentrations initially slightly increased followed by a decreasing tendency period temperature remained fairly stable during the last monitoring events methane toc and ph returned to levels similar to baseline these results are all consistent with the expected biotic reductive dechlorination reactions 4 2 chlorinated ethene and ethane concentrations molar mass fractions of all main compounds together with total voc concentrations only for chlorinated compounds in order to evaluate remediation effects on the most toxic compounds of the selected 28 monitoring wells are presented in fig 6a and b for respectively porous and bedrock wells voc concentrations are presented in table 2 of si the highest total voc concentrations in the on site source area was detected in pmg 01 within the organic clay unit with 1 2 dca showing the highest concentration followed by 1 1 dca vc cis 1 2 dce and a very low content of tce fig 6a table 1 of si these results suggest a distinct signature of mixed compounds chlorinated ethanes and to less degree ethenes and that biodegradation had already intensively occurred in the on site source area post remedial results indicate a significant decrease in total voc concentration up to 99 and the predominance of ethane and ethene this is a clear indication that the intensive treatment and post thermal biodegradation had been performed extremely well in the attenuation and transformation of voc to ethene and ethane fig 6a table 2 of si nearby on site monitoring wells pmg 002 pmg 004 pm 027fa pm 031fa pm 044f and pm 062f fig 3 presented similar patterns to well pmg 01 the 2019 results for pm 045f also in this region collected after the pilot remediation test showed a large amount of ethene 5820 μg l table 2 of si indicating an almost complete transformation of voc to final products of biodegradation the 2019 data showed ethene is not present and small amount of tce 1 1 dca and 1 1 2 tca and a small increase in vc and 1 1 dca fig 6a table 1 si this pattern is possibly due to a minor rebound and or side effect of the thermal and bioremediation treatments the molar fraction data from the groundwater of wells located directly downgradient from the off site source well pm 060f for example pm 051f pm 058f pm 062f pmi 09 pmi 010 pm 032f pmi 07 presents mixtures with variable compositions of chloroethene and chloroethane compounds together with ethene and ethane fig 6a and b table 2 of si these results suggest the existence of degradation processes and an evidence of a commingled plume situation a significant reduction in voc mass is observed in wells pm 058f and pm 062f in the 2019 data with proportional increase of the final product ethane which is likely to be related to the effect of the nearby thermal and bioremediation concerning the wells located further downgradient from both source zones for example pm 041f pmi 02 pmi 04 pm 052f pm 53f pmp 08 pp 02 and pp 05 they presented variable voc composition with predominance of a mixture of chlorinated ethane and ethene by products fig 6a and b these signatures suggest that potentially they could have originated from off site and or on site sources and were also under the influence of biodegradation this may have been further induced previously by the operation of the pump and treat system at several locations throughout this region after thermal and bio remediation typically the concentrations decreased and proportions of breakdown products increased mainly in the wells located in the weathered rock soil targeted by bio remediation and the soft weathered rock geological unit such as pm 041f pmi 04 and pm 053f fig 3 fig 6a and b no appreciable changes in concentration and molar fraction composition were observed between 2016 and 2019 data fig 6b in the shallowest and deepest port of the monitoring nest pp 02 located in the underlying fresh rock geological unit and further downgradient from the voc sources fig 1 it is possible it will take a longer period of time to see the effect of remediation treatment due to the distance or this also could be explained with the potential existence of areas in the bedrock with less connectivity to the remediated areas or the possible existence of another source area the mixed compound sources and generalized pattern of intensively biodegraded compounds hampered the interpretation of single compound distributions pce a chlorinated ethene parent compound identified predominantly only in the off site groundwater at well pm 60f had extremely limited presence in all downgradient wells despite wide occurrence of its biodegradation products 1 2 dca was identified throughout the whole study area including at both source areas most impacted wells and it was previously used on site therefore 1 2 dca could have been a chlorinated ethane parent compound however it could have been produced by the degradation of other products such as 1 1 2 tca that was identified only as a minor compound at specific wells the plumes of 1 2 dca identified in the 2016 and 2019 campaigns are presented respectively in fig 7a and b the 2016 plume does not clearly distinguish the source areas however the 1 2 dca distribution indicates the contribution of the off site and on site to the downgradient areas the 2019 plumes present a strong reduction in size and concentrations of 1 2 dca with no indications of plume displacement or rebound effects mainly in the on site source area targeted by thermal and bioremediation treatments indicating this source is no longer contributing 1 2 dca to the downgradient groundwater the study area included complexity issues posed by the close location less than 40 m of the source areas and limited information about the off site source area in addition the direction of groundwater flow was previously probably influenced by the former pump treat system that operated at pp 02 pp 05 and shallower levels including near pmi 02 this configuration see conceptual model in fig 2 plus the voc distribution and signatures fig 6 suggest that a mixing zone existed downgradient from both source areas this mixing area created commingled plumes among compounds present at one or both source areas such as pce and 1 2 dca in addition to a mixture of several degraded chlorinated ethane and ethene compounds the fraction related to each source varied throughout the commingled plumes however the 2019 results indicated that the on site source was intensively treated therefore it is expected that the on site contribution to the commingled plumes was reduced and possibly ceased this was also confirmed later in 2019 and 2020 by several monitoring campaigns of the expanded well network in addition to soil and vapour sampling studies which are not described in this paper 4 3 voc isotopic characterization the carbon and chlorine isotopic results in δ are presented respectively in tables 1 and 2 the baseline 2016 δ13c isotope results in groundwater present δ13c values of 17 5 and 1 8 for pce and 1 2 dca respectively in the off site source well pm 60f table 1 in the on site source groundwater of well pmg 01 a δ13c value of 10 3 was observed for 1 2 dca while pce was not analysed due to low detection of this compound 1 1 μg l table 2 of si these δ13c values are systematically more enriched isotopically compared with the values reported for commercial products that range between 23 and 33 for pce beneteau et al 1999 and between 26 5 and 29 5 for 1 2 dca palau et al 2014 schmidt et al 2014 franke et al 2017 these isotopic patterns plus the presence of by products indicated that biodegradation has been an active attenuation process for chlorinated compounds in the source areas prior to thermal and full scale bioremediation the δ13c results for potential parent compounds 1 1 2 2 teca and 1 1 2 tca are available for a limited number of wells mainly near the off site source area but are all lower than values identified in the same wells for 1 2 dca which is another evidence 1 2 dca is not a product of their degradation a wide range in isotopic baseline 2016 composition is observed for pce near or downgradient the off site source area with δ13c results varying between 20 7 and 7 9 and its potential by products range between 26 5 and 3 9 for tce 24 1 and 9 8 for 1 2 dce 31 3 and 5 5 for vc 22 7 and 4 6 for ethene and 16 6 and 9 6 for ethane table 1 the results are in general coherent with a reductive dechlorination pathway for pce hunkeler et al 1999 abe et al 2009 for 1 2 dca during the 2016 campaign a wide range of enriched δ13c values of 6 5 and 20 is observed near and downgradient from both sources indicating this compound has been affected by a high degree of enrichment with different potential degradation pathways and origins as discussed later on in this chapter the data collected in 2019 indicate δ13c isotopic results with further enriched values mainly in groundwater located in the area of influence of bioremediation and thermal treatment as further discussed at the end of this chapter for example well pmg 004 located near the area of the on site source fig 3 presented δ13c values of 14 5 for tce 3 1 for cis dce 0 7 for vc 45 2 for 1 2 dca 10 9 for ethane and 2 for ethene table 1 in 2019 chlorine isotopes for pce and its degradation products were sampled for the first time the δ37cl results for pce coherently with δ13c results indicate lower values near the off site source area between 1 8 and 0 9 and further enriched values between 2 8 and 4 6 in downgradient wells under the influence of remediation isotopic mass balance results over distance from the most upgradient well pm 60f near the offsite source area are presented in fig 8 tables 3 and 4 of si the results for 2016 fig 8a indicate high variations both for chlorinated ethenes δ13cce between 28 7 and 5 7 and ethanes δ13cca between 10 8 and 20 0 higher enriched values are identified mainly near the onsite source area 30 to 40 m and intermediate values further downgradient within the commingled plume this suggests potential mixture of source signatures and or further degradation from both chlorinated ethenes and ethanes towards none chlorinated compounds such as ethene and ethane and or other degradation pathways and or variations related to the different hydrogeological units the results for 2019 fig 8b indicate similar results with increases noted at a closer distance approximately 20 m and higher ranges for δ13cce between 29 3 and 2 9 and δ13cca between 4 3 and 40 9 these changes are likely to be related to remediation effects which enhanced degradation and isotopic enrichment 4 3 1 1 2 dca biodegradation pathways the by products of biodegradation of 1 2 dca potentially can include vc via dehydrohalogenation ethene via dihaloelimination and chloroethane via hydrogenolysis followed by ethane hunkeler et al 2002 palau et al 2017a and 2017b the 2016 and 2019 results indicate chloroethane was identified near detections limits or not detected excepting well pmg 03 in 2019 which presented a concentration of 2190 μg l table 2 of si these results tend to discard chloroethane production as the main degradation pathway for 1 2 dca a further insight about the origin of vc ethene and ethane can be done analysing the baseline 2016 tables 1 and 2 of si concentration and isotope data for the groundwater representative of the off site and in situ source areas for example the groundwater in the off site well pm 60f is characterized by a 1 2 dca concentration of 4640 μg l vc at 3210 μg l ethene at 2090 μg l and ethane at 798 μg l δ13c results values indicate 1 2 dca values of 1 8 vc at 18 3 ethene at 22 7 and ethane 16 6 the enriched isotopic values observed for ethene and ethane suggests both gases have been affected by biodegradation and the non presence of chloroethane indicated that ethane is a by product of biodegradation of ethene as discussed previously this is a well were vc is likely to have originated from the degradation of the parent compound pce and its by products the highly enriched δ13c for 1 2 dca and the high concentration of ethene suggests that 1 2 dca was biodegrading to ethene the groundwater in the in situ source well pmg 01 is characterized by a 1 2 dca concentration of 32 500 μg l vc at 8900 μg l ethene at 23700 μg l and ethane at 5 μg l δ13c results show values for 1 2 dca of 10 3 vc at 31 3 ethene at 2 5 and ethane not analysed due to none detectable concentrations these results indicated that vc has been accumulating and has not been transformed to ethene which is likely to be a direct biodegradation product of 1 2 dca ethane was not detected in this groundwater confirming it was not a main biodegradation product of 1 2 dca concerning the fate of the gases the isotopic mass balance results fig 8 and the range with highly enriched δ13c values observed in 2016 table 1 for ethene 22 7 to 4 6 and ethane 16 6 to 9 6 indicate that further transformation of the parent compounds to non toxic compounds have occurred and these gases have also been affected by biodegradation 4 3 2 carbon isotope data for 1 2 dca prior and post remediation since 1 2 dca is one of the main compounds present in the on site and off site voc source areas its carbon isotope data will be used to evaluate the signatures throughout the study area including at the comingling plume located downgradient from the sources 1 2 dca is also considered a potential parent compound as suggested by the on site history and isotopes results table 1 which simplifies the interpretation of the isotopic signatures as their values shall not be influenced by fractionation during previous degradation steps fig 9a and b presents the isotopic results on map and proposes general plume zonings based on the combination of the lines of evidence presented in this paper hydrogeology geochemistry voc and isotopic signatures a large isotopic difference is observed in 1 2 dca 2016 results fig 9a in the sources areas which are characterized by a δ13c value of 1 8 in well pm 060f representing the off site source compared to a δ13c value of 10 3 in well pmg 01 representing the on site source a lower δ13c value of 6 5 than the 1 2 dca at well pm 060f located in the weathered rock soil unit was observed in the nearby well pm 51f located in the shallower sandy deposit unit possibly due to source and or degradation heterogeneities highly enriched δ13c values of 8 6 pm 031fa 15 1 pm 027fa 14 9 pmg 002 and 20 0 pmg 003 are also observed in 1 2 dca in groundwater of other wells tapping the organic clay and the sand unit located most near the on site source area most impacted well pmg 01 then groundwater in wells tapping the soft weathered rocks located east perpendicular to recorded groundwater flow directions of the on site source and downgradient from the off site source show lower δ13c values of 2 5 pm 058f 3 0 pm 062f and 2 8 pm 032f for 1 2 dca fig 9a these results at least 5 6 below the minimum value mentioned above for the on site nearby source area wells suggest none or less on site source influence over an off site plume that presents progressive isotopic enrichment due to degradation as it moves downgradient further downgradient from the two sources areas all δ13c 1 2 dca values fig 9a are within the range of 2 8 to 3 0 apart from 4 0 and 7 0 at pp 05 55 7 m and pp 05 82 5 m which are respectively 4 6 and 1 6 lower than the minimum value identified at the on site most nearby source area wells this suggests mixing of plumes of both sources in a comingled plume configuration with predominance of δ13c values that are more like the signature of the off site source most impacted wells pm 060f and pm 051f and their downgradient wells pm 058f pm 060f and pm 032f because of the high rate of degradation caused by the thermal and bioremediation the δ13c 1 2 dca in the treatment areas presented further enrichment in 2019 compared to 2016 the 2019 isotope data in groundwater in the treatment area fig 3 show δ13c values ranging between 24 7 pmi 09 and 45 2 pmg 04 at the off site source area wells that were not targeted by thermal or bioremediation the δ13c 1 2 dca presented a lower level of enrichment 7 4 at pm 060f and 3 7 at pm 051f the first well pm 058f located at east of the on site source also shows a highly enriched δ13c value of 18 fig 9b which is correlated with a large reduction in 1 2 dca concentration fig 6a table 2 of si these δ13c 1 2 dca enrichments out of the targeted treatment areas are probably related to positive degradation side effects of the nearby thermal and bioremediation related to influence of temperature and toc increases the δ13c 1 2 dca in the groundwater further east of the on site source area presents values of 4 1 well pmi 07 and 4 8 pmi 10 which are close to that detected in the 2016 campaign for the nearby well 2 8 at pm 032f this confirms this part of the study area was not targeted neither intensively affected by the thermal and bioremediation treatments in addition the values detected in this region are again most like the off site source area wells signatures pm 060f and pm 051f the downgradient groundwater from both sources along the comingled plume show similar isotopic pattern than in 2016 apart from increases at bedrock wells pm 041f from 1 3 to 14 7 and less significantly at pp 05 30 8 m from 2 3 to 4 3 and pp 02 79 3 m from 0 0 to 1 8 as groundwater flow presents high velocity in the fractured rock aquifer this isotopic variation may be related to the δ13c enrichment observed in the area of the on site source thermal treatment and nearby bioremediation activities this is also supported by the geochemical variations evidences see section 4 1 and hydrogeological testing hart et al 2021 the 2019 carbon isotope data similarly to the 2016 campaign indicates the downgradient commingle plume presents predominance of values that are more similar to the off site source signature reinforced by the on site source thermal intensive treatment and isotopic enrichment 4 3 3 dual carbon and chlorine isotope patterns dual carbon chlorine isotope results for chlorinated ethenes of the 2019 campaign are plotted in fig 10 together with plotted average lines and equations including slopes calculated for the data they can be used to support differentiation between processes governing pce degradation kuder et al 2013 badin et al 2016 it is important to highlight that pce was identified as a major compound only in the off site source area near well pm 060f however cannot be discarded that other pce sources exist mainly in the off site areas that were not investigated this could be an explanation for pmi 10 lower δ13c and δ37cl pce results tables 1 and 2 and fig 10 as wells as source and or degradation heterogeneities the groundwater with the highest temperature indicative of thermal treatment and methane indicative of bio remediation detections were highlighted in order to support evaluation of eventual processes induced by remediation the wells that presented higher δ13c and δ37cl values correlate to those with higher methane concentrations suggesting higher degradation levels there are some isotope data in groundwater such as wells pmg 04 and pm 045f locate near the on site source and thermal remediation area that are out of the general linear pattern shown by the other wells and present more intensive carbon enrichment their distribution potentially is related to a different pattern and could be explained if existed another pce source not identified with different original signature carbon enriched another potential explanation could be a thermal induced degradation pathway related to this type of heating which caused in addition to inducing bio degradation volatilization not expected to cause high δ13c fractionation according to slater et al 2000 and hydrolysis to be further researched and characterized for isotopic fractionation the evaluation of these hypothesis is restricted due to uncertainties related to the initial sources content off site source area investigation lack of pre remediation chlorine isotopic results and limited references concerning isotopic fractionation associated with thermal induced degradation badin et al 2016 murray et al 2019 nonetheless the overall results confirm that carbon and chlorine isotopic fractionation occurred due to both bio remediation and thermal treatment by stimulating bio degradation and potentially via another process such as hydrolysis to be further investigated in order to further evaluate isotopic fractionation trends the obtained dual c cl slopes values for the combined data set were compared to other field studies and laboratory experiments results compiled and complemented by murray et al 2019 data have been reported for oxidation and reductive dechlorination pathways both biotic and abiotic however non for combined thermal and bio remediation for pce the slope obtained in the current study 2 1 falls within the range widely reported for biotic reductive dechlorination 0 7 to 3 8 for tce the obtained slope 2 5 also falls within the range widely reported for biotic reductive dechlorination 2 3 4 8 for cis 1 2 dce the identified slope 1 6 is significantly lower than the ranges reported for biotic reductive dechlorination 4 5 to 17 8 and abiotic degradation 3 1 to 5 0 however fits within the range of 1 5 to 3 0 reported for combined biotic and abiotic degradation processes for vc references were not identified and therefore comparison was not possible this overall evaluation is another evidence that isotopic fractionation occurred due to biotic reductive dechlorination it also suggests there is a need for further studies characterizing isotopic fractionation during vocs degradation by thermally induced processes mainly hydrolysis to assess potential specific characteristics of this degradation pathway 5 conclusions chlorinated ethanes and ethenes isotopic analyses in groundwater and hydrogeochemical results from a former industrial area in sao paulo brazil were used to evaluate source areas and commingled plumes both before and after thermal and bioremediation treatments in weathered fractured bedrock the δ13c groundwater baseline isotopic results 2016 indicated clear differences for chlorinated ethanes and ethenes signatures and mass balances throughout the study area the main well of the recently identified off site source area well pm 60f was dominated by chlorinated ethenes and presented the typical reductive dichlorination trend with δ13c values of 17 5 for pce 21 3 for tce 16 3 for cis dce and 18 3 for vc a relative high concentration of 1 2 dca is found in this groundwater characterized by a δ13c of 1 8 a δ13c value of 6 2 for 1 2 dca was found in a nearby well pm 51f which is characterized by much lower concentration of chlorinated ethenes and higher concentration of 1 2 dca vc and ethene the on site source area wells were dominated by chlorinated ethanes and much more enriched δ13c values 8 6 to 20 0 for 1 2 dca than the off site source area wells the observed 1 2 dca large isotope difference between source areas and its presence throughout the study were favourable conditions to evaluate the hypothesis of the existence commingled plumes intermediate δ13c values for 1 2 dca and mixed voc concentrations were identified in wells downgradient from both source areas consistent with commingled plumes formation the wells downgradient from the source areas presented variable content of degradation products under favourable hydrogeochemical conditions for biotic reductive dechlorination of chlorinated ethanes and dihaloelimination for 1 2 dca the existence of commingled plumes were also supported by the proximity of the source areas less than 40 m and hydrogeological characteristics including high connectivity between geological units and potential past groundwater converging flow directions when pumping activities occurred hart et al 2021 the δ13c isotopic results from the post remediation campaign 2019 were consistent with the baseline results however presented additional isotopic enrichments mainly near the treatment areas the hydrogeochemical evaluation confirmed that the biotic reductive dechlorination conditions were enhanced by both the bio remediation and thermal treatment the temperature increases induced natural carbon solubilisation and temporally reached microbial optimum levels around 40 c horst et al 2018 leite et al 2021 this was also evaluated with dual carbon chlorine isotope slopes for the chlorinated ethenes which indicated that most enriched values were identified at wells with higher methane concentrations indicative of toc bio degradation and mainly for δ13c at wells where temperature had increased due to thermal treatment the slopes were compared with available reference values and were typically coherent with ranges reported for biotic reductive dechlorination pathway kuder et al 2013 badin et al 2016 degradation products were also detected both for biotic reductive dechlorination and hydrolysis pathways chloride increase and ph decrease matching voc concentrations reductions the results of this study allowed further characterization of the chlorinated ethane and ethene source areas and confirm the formation of commingled plumes in a complex setting they were consistent with the temporal conceptual model proposed by hart et al 2021 and also suggest there is a need for further studies characterizing isotopic fractionation during voc degradation by thermally induced processes mainly hydrolysis to assess potential specific characteristics of this degradation pathway these results and conclusions potentially can be used as a scientific basis for other studies in areas with similar characteristics such as tropically weathered bedrock aquifers undefined sources commingled plumes thermal and bioremediation activities funding this work was supported by basf s a declaration of competing interest the
