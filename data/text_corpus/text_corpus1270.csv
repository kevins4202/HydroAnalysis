6350,during the expansion of urban areas small natural reserves have often been left intact within the built environment as central elements of biodiversity conservation ecological connectivity landscape sustainability and quality of life of urban dwellers consequently the surrounding urbanized landscape may impact the environmental conditions of these reserves e g high temperatures low moisture conditions resulting in the need for extensive maintenance this study presents an estimation of the water balance over two years 2017 2018 in three small urban reserves between 2 and 30 ha within the greater melbourne metropolitan area in australia for the purpose of understanding tree water use measurements of micrometeorological variables soil moisture content profiles water table levels sap flow velocities and stem diameter variations were used to quantify the water sources of tree transpiration in these reserves results revealed that despite the urban surroundings and the climate variations these reserves have enough water to sustain tree transpiration in two of the three reserves groundwater was pivotal in sustaining transpiration rates specifically groundwater was estimated to contribute about 30 40 of the total transpiration amount during the driest periods of the year groundwater also played an essential role during nights with temperatures above 25 c helping trees to maintain night time water use from 3 to 16 of the daily water use in the third reserve the presence of a shallow layer of heavy clay supplied water to the trees which were able to maintain relatively constant transpiration rates throughout the year these results demonstrate the importance of understanding the water regime of each urban reserve in order to support government authorities in preserving these ecosystems 2010 msc 00 01 99 00 keywords groundwater dependent ecosystems remnant vegetation urban green spaces urban parks urban reserves heat stress 1 introduction the rapid expansion of urban areas to accommodate the growing number of city dwellers represents one of the most irreversible human impacts on the global biosphere and poses unique challenges for ecosystems seto et al 2012 changes in land cover associated with urbanization generate a fragmented and heterogeneous landscape where patches of vegetation often remnants of natural habitats are embedded in a highly disturbed environment mckinney 2002 remaining pockets of vegetation within the built environment are recognized as important areas for biodiversity conservation elmqvist et al 2015 tulloch et

processes closer to natural conditions e g yang et al 2015 livesley et al 2016 berland et al 2017 considering its importance there are concerns that the urban surrounds may be exerting negative impacts on the remaining vegetation by imposing changes in the radiation and energy budget the hydrologic regime and ecosystem composition and structure roberts 1977 sieghardt et al 2005 specifically increased temperatures and lower air humidity due to the uhi often expose the trees embedded in the urban landscape to high atmospheric evaporative demand this can lead to higher transpiration rates in particular when soil moisture is not a limiting factor litvak et al 2011 chen et al 2011 litvak and pataki 2016 zipper et al 2017 litvak et al 2017 asawa et al 2017 the increase of impervious surfaces and the introduction of drainage infrastructure lead to greater rates and volumes of surface runoff and reduce the volume of water which infiltrates the soils decreasing the water available to sustain vegetation growth and health xiao et al 2007 barron et al 2013 shields and tague 2015 in addition increasing drought van loon et al 2016 and extreme heat events amplify the water stress of urban trees resulting in the decline of their health conditions during heat events being photosynthesis and stomatal conductance strongly coupled net rates of leaf photosynthesis and transpiration are expected to decline toward zero due to the high temperatures and vapor pressure deficit vpd recent studies however found that cooling of leaves by transpiration might be an important component to plant response to extreme temperatures leading to substantial rates of transpiration drake et al 2018 what remains of natural habitats within urban areas can also undergo changes in vegetation structure with the introduction of non native species thus creating unique biotic communities with different water needs and more complex patterns of evapotranspiration interception and infiltration endter wada et al 2008 mccarthy and pataki 2010 pataki et al 2011 in the greater melbourne metropolitan area australia for instance large areas of native vegetation have been replaced by urban and suburban landscapes over the past decades delwp 2016 the consequences for the native plants are substantial with less than 4 cover of native vegetation remaining within the urban growth boundary bradshaw 2012 hahs and mcdonnell 2014 this remaining native vegetation is severely fragmented into small reserves which become isolated and sometimes degraded moreover a further decline in vegetation health have been documented during the millennium drought that occurred approximately between 2001 and 2009 van dijk et al 2013 in this context maximizing the effectiveness of remnant native vegetation conservation through active management is important to avoid further losses of vegetation associated with urbanization therefore there is an increasing need for empirical evidence of the role that water availability and the built landscape play in the physiological response of vegetation to urban conditions livesley et al 2016 more information is also needed to understand the water requirements of these green spaces enabling better design management guidelines for the preservation of these ecosystems this involves the identification of the water resources that are most important to maintain key ecosystem features and processes including the degree of the ecosystem groundwater dependency eamus and froend 2006 o grady et al 2006 this study aims to gain a better understanding of the interactions and feedback between water resources and vegetation health in small natural reserves embedded in the urban environment the objectives are to a determine variations in the water balance of urban reserves under different water regimes b analyze the influence of micro meteorological drivers and groundwater availability on tree water use and c understand the impact of heat stress on night time tree water use 2 material and methods 2 1 study sites this study was conducted in the greater melbourne metropolitan area located in southeast australia melbourne has a maritime temperate climate köppen climate classification cfa with a strong spatial heterogeneity of rainfall within the metropolitan area decreasing from south east to north west the study focused on three urban reserves hosting predominantly remnant native vegetation with occasionally introduced species national drive reserve and alex wilkie reserve are embedded in the south eastern suburbs while napier park is located about 9 km north west of the melbourne central business district cbd fig 1 a national drive reserve nd covers an area of 14 ha and is located about 40 km from the melbourne cbd the area consists of a large stand of eucalyptus camaldulensis river red gum woodland with the understory dominated by pasture grasses the soil is predominantly silty clay in the first 40 cm followed by clay with the water table depth ranging between 3 and 4 m below the ground surface long term average annual rainfall is 757 148 mm mean sd mean minimum temperature is 10 0 c and mean maximum temperature is 19 8 c 1968 2018 bureau of meteorology bom station 086224 the station 086077 located at about 10 km from nd was also used to fill extensive data gaps in daily temperature series alex wilkie nature reserve aw is a sandy plain woodland of about 1 8 ha located 10 km to the north west of national drive reserve the reserve is populated mostly with e viminalis coast manna gum and e cephalocarpa silver leafed stringybark with other natural and planted lower trees e g allocasuarina littoralis banksia marginata and shrubs the soil consists of loamy sand which becomes sandy clay to about 3 m below ground level and then silty sand at about 7 m below ground level the depth to groundwater ranges between 3 and 5 m below the ground surface long term average annual rainfall is 684 132 mm mean minimum temperature is 10 2 c and mean maximum temperature is 19 8 c 1968 2018 bom station 086077 napier park np 4 1 ha is home to a valuable population of e camaldulensis with a number of significant e melliodora yellow box texture contrast soils duplex cover the entire area of the reserve with the soil profile consisting of a sandy silt up to 0 6 m overlaying a heavy clay between 0 6 and 1 8 m followed by sandy silt again groundwater depth is about 20 m below the ground surface long term average annual rainfall is 557 119 mm mean minimum temperature is 10 0 c and mean maximum temperature is 20 4 c 1968 2018 bom station 086038 concerns over declining ecological condition of the existing remnant vegetation led to the installation of an extensive irrigation system utilizing stormwater harvesting irrigation commenced in january 2016 water delivery aims to recharge the soil stores for about 85 of the reserve responding to the site specific requirements of the remnant population of e camaldulensis which needs to be intermittently flooded 2 2 stand characteristics the study was conducted over the two year period from july 2016 to june 2018 several 50 m 50 m plots were selected in each reserve covering a range of vegetation and environmental conditions e g moisture conditions fig 1 stand density stems ha 1 for each plot was calculated from tree count and area taking into account both live and dead trees total basal area ba m2ha 1 was estimated by measuring diameter at breast height dbh at 1 3 m from the ground of all trees alive and dead with stems larger than 10 cm in diameter including multi stemmed trees percentage of live basal area lba was then calculated as the proportion of the total basal area contributed by live trees 2 3 micrometeorology micrometeorological data including rainfall p air temperature t a relative humidity rh and incoming shortwave solar radiation r s were measured every 15 minutes using automatic weather stations aws campbell scientific daily vapor pressure deficit vpd was calculated from t a and rh measurements were conducted in appropriate open grassy areas within nd and aw reserves for the entire period of the study at np a weather station was placed within a private garden adjacent to the park between november 2016 to february 2017 the data collected from the site specific weather stations were combined with the data from the closest bom weather stations i e bom stations 086224 for nd 086077 for aw and 086038 for np to estimate long term 1968 2018 average annual rainfall and temperature for all sites to fill data gaps in the rainfall time series recorded at nd between july to december 2016 and aw in march and july 2017 as well as from september 2017 to june 2018 and to integrate the limited time series of micrometeorological data available from the aws installed at np i e from november 2016 to february 2017 comparing the bom data with the data recorded at nd aw and np using aws a good agreement was found in terms of monthly rainfall for nd r2 0 84 and in terms of weekly and monthly rainfall for aw r2 0 86 and 0 94 respectively and np r2 0 74 and 0 81 respectively therefore bom data were used to fill gaps in the data collected from the site specific weather stations 2 4 soil water and groundwater soil volumetric water content θ and soil temperature were measured every 15 minutes using fully encapsulated soil water capacitance probes drill drop sentek these probes measure the volumetric water content through sensors fixed at 10 cm increments from the surface to a depth of 120 cm five probes were installed at nd three at aw and six at np measurements were validated using the gravimetric method with oven drying o kelly 2004 which involves the collection using a sampling ring of soil samples around the probes at different measuring depths in our specific case soil samples were collected at 5 cm and 15 cm depths as deeper soil layers could not be reached due to the nature of the soils at all sites the samples were then used to estimate dry mass and bulk density i e dry mass of the soil in the given sampling volume the latter showing variations with depth ρ bulk 5 cm 1 1 0 2 g cm 3 ρ bulk 15 cm 1 4 0 1 g cm3 good agreement was found between θ measured with the drill drop sensors and that estimated from the volumetric soil sample analysis in the first 20 cm of soil water table depth relative to the ground surface was measured at 15 min intervals in monitoring bores at nd 11 1 m depth and aw 9 m depth each bore was equipped with a water level datalogger 3001 lt levelogger edge solinist and a barometric datalogger 3001 lt barologger edge solinist to enable specific barometric compensation manual water level measurements were conducted on a regular basis using a dip meter dipper t heron instrument inc to validate the water level measurements uncertainties related to the measurements of θ in the top 1 2 m of soil i e 0 03 and water table depths i e 0 05 were not considered in the water balance as annual changes in θ and water table depths were small compared to the other components of the water balance 2 5 sap flow measurements and stand transpiration water use of individual trees was determined using commercially available sap flow sensors sfm1 ict international australia which use the heat pulse velocity hpv technique to measure high low and reverse rates of sap flow from the velocity of a short pulse of heat moving along the xylem tissue hpv was recorded at half hourly intervals in several trees within the reserves and corrected for wounding effects following burgess et al 2001 wound widths were obtained from data in the literature collected for similar trees sensors were placed approximately at breast height 1 30 m from the ground on a total of twelve trees four at each site table 1 because the reserves are open to the public the number of trees selected could not be larger and remain inconspicuous measurements were converted to sap flux density sfd cm3cm 2 h 1 based on wood core measurements of dry wood density gravimetric sapwood moisture content and sapwood area calculated from stem diameter and thickness of sapwood and bark during warm summer nights with temperatures above 25 c and consequent high vpd forster 2014 the magnitude of night time sfd sfd n was estimated as a proportion of the 24 h sap flow considering sfd n from 23 00 to 05 00 following the method proposed by zeppel et al 2010 plot level transpiration t plot was calculated from the water use of individual trees using the linear relationship r2 0 86 p 0 05 between dbh cm and sapwood area a sapwood cm2 established based on the twelve selected trees across the three study sites fig 2 estimates of t plot mm h 1 were thus calculated as 1 t plot sfd avg a t a plot 10 4 2 a t i 1 n 10 02 dbh i 91 90 where a t is the total sapwood area in a plot cm2 sfd avg is the average area weighted sfd mm h 1 of the measured trees in the plot and n is the number of trees within the 50 m 50 m plot area a plot m2 the transpiration at the scale of the reserve t was estimated by averaging t plot for all measurement plots within each study site potential errors in the measurements of sfd using hpv sensors might lead to an underestimation of the actual sfd of up to 35 after wound correction these errors increase with sfd and are mainly caused by heterogeneity of the sapwood steppe et al 2010 additional errors may occur during the scaling of measurements from a single point to the whole tree due to the radial and circumferential variability in sap flux density the magnitude of this error mainly depends on the width of the sapwood area nadezhdina et al 2002 the hpv technique is recognized to be the most accurate when compared to the thermal dissipation peters et al 2018 and heat field deformation methods estimates of transpiration from stem sap flow data should also include a lag coefficient to account for the withdrawal of water from internal storage several studies demonstrated that 10 to 15 of daily transpiration may be provided by stem water stores e g meinzer et al 2004 matheny et al 2015 however because the dynamics of stored water affect mainly the patterns of intra daily transpiration matheny et al 2015 they have not been taken into account in this study 2 6 stem diameter variation measurements a total of six trees among the ones monitored with sap flow sensors were also equipped with band dendrometers dbl60 ict international australia to measure tree diameters over time table 1 the dbl60 sensors were fixed to the tree trunk with a 12 mm wide stainless steel tape at about 1 3 m height on the southern side of the tree a portion of the outermost bark was removed prior to installation to provide an undisturbed point of contact for the tape stem diameter variation sdv and temperature were recorded every 5 minutes sdv signals were then corrected for sensor temperature sensitivity applying an average thermal expansion coefficient of 1 17 10 6 μ m μ m c 1 according to vandegehuchte et al 2014 2 7 water balance an estimation of the water balance of each reserve was conducted out for 2 years july 2016 to june 2017 referred to as 2017 water year and july 2017 to june 2018 referred to as 2018 water year using 3 p t δ s q et where p is rainfall t is tree transpiration t t sw t gw t sw and t gw are the transpiration components depleting the unsaturated and saturated zones respectively δ s is total water storage change δ s δ s sw s δ s sw d δ s gw

errors including systematic errors in the estimates of the water budget variables all terms of eq 3 are expressed in equivalent water depths per unit of ground area mm the equation was used to estimate et δ s sw d for each site on a water year basis q being negligible in all study sites the change in soil water storage δ s sw s was calculated as the average change in volumetric water content in the soil profile at each measurement point i e the average water content for the 12 sensors over the length of the probe the change in groundwater storage δ s gw was calculated only for nd and aw reserves as the change in water table depth between consecutive years multiplied by the specific yield the specific yield was estimated as a function of the sediment texture as recommended for depths to the water table greater than 1 m loheide et al 2005 in particular the specific yield at nd was estimated as 2 and 7 at aw as in johnson 1963 deeper roots also extend below the depth to which soil water probes were installed reaching the water table or its capillary fringe to quantify the groundwater uptake t gw by trees in the sites where plants have access to groundwater the method developed by white white 1932 and later refined by loheide et al 2005 was used accordingly 4 t gw s y 24 r s where s y is the specific yield r mm h 1 is the rate of water table rise from midnight to 4 a m and s mm is the rise or fall of the groundwater level over a 24 h period i e from midnight to midnight the method was applied during rain free periods of few days for which water levels in the bores during the night can be reasonably assumed to be due to a net recovery flux toward the bore orellana et al 2012 3 results 3 1 stand characteristics stand characteristics differed significantly across reserves as well as between plots within the same reserve table 1 nd was overall the more dense site 248 704 stems ha 1 with a woodland structure that varied from east to west across the reserve higher basal area was found in plots nd1 ca 41 m2 ha 1 and nd4 39 m2 ha 1 in the north east and south east parts of the site respectively in all plots living trees accounted for more than 90 of the total basal area with a size about 2 2 times larger than dead trees the woodland structure at aw reserve varied from west to east with a higher stand density in the aw1 plot 600 stems ha 1 compared to the aw2 plot 428 stems ha 1 aw1 plot is also characterized by the highest abundance of large trees 16 trees ha 1 within the reserve however in both plots living and dead trees had similar dbh distributions at np dead trees were on average 1 5 times larger than live trees and the mean basal area for the four plots was 19 0 9 m2 ha 1 mean sd the live tree distribution at napier park was dominated by trees with a dbh of 0 15 0 17 m with few very large trees dbh 0 6 m 3 2 water balance seasonal patterns of t a r s and vpd were similar across all study sites during the two year study period fig 3 compared to the alternate year mean temperatures were higher during november 2017 and january and february 2018 with the last two months characterized by a large number of very warm nights having temperatures over 25 c the environmental factors r s and vpd influencing tree transpiration strengthened from winter to summer with r s characterized by monthly means ranging between 4 and 25 mj m 2 and monthly means of vpd varying from 1 to 2 5 kpa the maximum recorded hourly mean r s was 1200 w m 2 in summer and 520 w m 2 during winter for aw and np and 910 w m 2 in summer to 415 w m 2 in winter for nd the average maximum recorded vpd in an hour ranged from 7 4 kpa nd 6 1 aw and 5 95 np during summer 2018 to 1 8 kpa for all sites during winter 2018 lower values were recorded during summer and winter 2017 rainfall p did not display a marked seasonal variation but varied significantly among the study sites for both the 2017 and 2018 water years decreasing as expected from west to east fig 4 a during the 2017 water year rainfall was close to the 50 year average with winter and spring above average the 2018 water year was drier than average despite the wetter months of december and january fig 4a fig 3 observed transpiration t at reserve scale fig 3 displayed a distinct seasonal pattern particularly at nd where higher tree density overall led to higher transpiration rates transpiration ranged from 11 5 mm month 1 in june 2017 to 40 8 mm month 1 in january 2018 with an average of 26 2 mm month 1 lower transpiration rates were measured in aw where dbh are much lower than nd transpiration at aw ranged from 12 2 mm month 1 in june 2017 to 22 4 mm month 1 in january 2018 with an average of 17 6 mm month 1 transpiration rates in different months at np were similar in the two years with an average transpiration of about 7 5 mm month 1 temporal averaged θ calculated as the mean of all the measurements over the study period in each site shows different soil moisture profiles in the sites fig 4b shallow layers of soil remained relatively dry at aw θ 0 05 m3 m 3 with a more pronounced response to rainfall events at depths of about 1 m particularly for the wetter year 2017 conversely at nd and np θ in shallow layers varied more compared to deeper layers three distinct soil zones could be identified at np very dry topsoil increasingly wet layers between 0 3 to 0 6 m and near saturated layers below these profiles clearly reflect the profile of soil texture at the three sites water table depth fig 5 at aw had a visible seasonal cycle with recharge from rainfall occurring between september and december at nd groundwater appeared to be less sensitive to rainfall but conversely the effects of prolonged rain free periods were more pronounced in particular an increase of 0 35 m in the depth to groundwater table was recorded during the 20 days without rain between february and march 2017 and an increase of 0 18 m was measured during the 14 day rain free period in march 2018 the data of p t θ and water table levels were used to estimate the water balance of the reserves table 2 with considerable inter annual and inter site variability in the water balance components during the two years 2017 2018 nd received about 789 mm of rain while for the irrigated site i e np the total amount of incoming water including both the annual precipitation and the irrigation water was 100 mm despite more rainfall during 2017 than during 2018 the site averaged transpiration was quite similar for the two years of study of this rainfall about 297 332 mm 42 45 of the annual rainfall was returned to the atmosphere through tree transpiration at nd 205 210 mm 31 35 at aw and only 85 91 mm 14 18 at np accounting for the high dependency of plot level transpiration on the number of live trees table 1 among the three study sites aw experienced in 2017 a strong soil water depletion in the first 1 2 m of monitored soil 60 mm with a pronounced recharge to groundwater 16 mm the opposite behavior was recorded in 2018 when a considerable decline of δ s gw 31 mm occurred while the water content of the unsaturated zone increased δ s sw s increased overall at nd 15 mm in 2017 and 9 mm in 2018 whereas small variations were observed with respect to δ s gw taking into account only δ s sw s np showed a response similar to aw with a decline in 2017 and an increase in 2018 the annual water balance closure et δ s sw varied from 351 to 588 mm yr 1 representing 56 75 and 96 of p during the wet year 2017 and 53 66 and 88 during the dry year 2018 for nd aw and np respectively these values are further discussed in section 4 3 3 groundwater uptake by vegetation diurnal fluctuations in the depth to the groundwater table were observed during several rain free days for both 2017 and 2018 at nd fig 6 a and fig 6c as sfd increased during the daylight hours the depth to groundwater table declined while during the night a reduction in tree transpiration coincided with a rise in the water table indicating a recovery flux toward the bore these patterns of water table are often associated with groundwater uptake by tree roots for transpiration loheide et al 2005 orellana et al 2012 a total of 8 days were selected within the two prolonged rain free periods in 2017 and 2018 using eq 4 groundwater uptake t gw was estimated to range between 0 4 and 1 1 mm d 1 for a total of 5 mm during the 2017 rain free period and between 0 04 and 0 6 mm d 1 for a total of 2 6 mm during the 2018 rain free period therefore about 42 sd 16 and 29 sd 15 of transpiration was estimated to be from groundwater in those periods fig 6b and fig 6d it was not possible to detect a clear diurnal water table signal at aw the delay in the downward propagation of air pressure through the pores of the unsaturated zone generated water fluctuations in the bore that overshadowed the diurnal signal examining the trends in soil water content fig 4b and transpiration rates during the prolonged rain free periods in 2017 and 2018 suggested that transpiration rates were not limited by the modest soil water availability the diurnal shrinking and swelling of the tree trunk for ev1 along with sustained sfd also supported the presence of t gw at aw fig 7 swelling started in the late afternoon when the evaporative demand decreased considerably and continued throughout the night due to the water uptake as evapotranspiration demand increased during the daylight hours shrinkage occurred the contribution of groundwater uptake to the total transpiration was quantified by estimating the change in water table depth attributed to the specific rain free period using this method a total of 2 8 mm of t gw was estimated for the 8 days between february and march 2017 being about 47 of total transpiration a small data gap did not allow t gw to be estimated for the 2018 summer rain free period 3 4 night time tree water use warm summer nights with temperatures above 25 c following days with temperatures above 35 c occurred a few times within the two years of this study in most circumstances trees under observation coped well with these short heat events and did not lose their hydraulic functions substantial night time sfd was recorded in both ev1 and ev3 during the nights between 7 and 8 of january and between 8 and 9 of february 2017 fig 8 a and fig 8d the high temperatures on these nights were associated with consequent high vpd which likely led to transpiration during the night during the two recorded warm summer nights sfd n was found to be about 11 ev1 and 16 ev3 of the daily water use for january 2017 and about 3 ev1 and 13 ev3 for february 2017 measurements of diurnal shrinking and swelling of the tree trunk also verified the presence of night time water use during the first warm night swelling usually occurring near sunset when the evaporative demand decreased coincided with a reduced amplitude due to the night time transpiration causing an even larger shrinkage when the evaporative demand increased during the following daylight hours fig 8b and fig 8c this phenomenon was also present during the second warm night even though recent rainfall events affected the diurnal signal of dbh fig 8e and fig 8f 4 discussion this study attempts to understand and quantify the water balance and tree water use of small urban reserves in two of the study sites i e nd and aw groundwater was found to play an essential role in supporting tree transpiration especially during the driest periods of the year and heat events at np groundwater not being easily accessible the water stored in the shallow clay layer of the duplex soil supported transpiration rates as observed in other similar conditions verma et al 2014 observed transpirations rates were found to be comparable to estimates from other eucalyptus stands in natural areas e g zeppel et al 2006 doody et al 2015 transpiration rates at nd ranged from 1 3 to 0 5 mm day 1 during summer and winter while at aw they were from 0 9 to 0 25 mm day 1 at np t ranged between 0 3 mm day 1 during summer and 0 1 mm day 1 in winter in both years t was about 44 nd 33 aw and 16 np of total annual rainfall showing large inter site variability due to different natural rainfall regimes and stand density table table 1 table 2 on the contrary small inter annual variability was observed although annual rainfall in 2018 was about 15 lower than 2017 in both years a large portion of the water balance closure was attributed to et i e et floor e i and δ s sw d the magnitude of et and δ s sw d can be estimated from previous studies conducted on similar vegetation cover and hydrologic regime benyon and doody 2015 specifically et floor may represent more than 50 of total et zeppel et al 2006 and about 23 37 of the annual rainfall benyon and doody 2015 whereas e i may be between 15 to 26 of the total annual rainfall dunin et al 1988 farrington and bartle 1991 hutley et al 2000 bulcock and jewitt 2012 accordingly considering et floor e i about 50 of the annual rainfall this term accounted for 89 nd 66 aw and 52 np of the water balance closure for the 2017 water year and 94 nd 75 aw and 57 np for the 2018 water year these estimates support the water balance in table 2 especially for nd in which δ s sw d is expected to be small due to the clayey nature of the soil which enhances the capillary rise up to the monitored soil layers as also shown in fig 4b at aw higher proportions of interception losses e i should be considered due to the dense understory cover as well higher δ s sw d may be expected because of the highly sandy soil which increases the movement of water beyond the monitored soil profile at np the water balance was only conducted for the monitored soil 0 1 2 m with δ s sw d representing the downward drainage below this depth at this site extensive grassy and bare soil areas may also contribute to a larger percentage of floor evaporation most of the uncertainties in the estimates of the water balance components are related to the underestimation of canopy transpiration accounting for an underestimation of t of 35 would result in an annual water balance closure of 41 65 and 91 of p during 2017 and 38 54 and 81 in 2018 for nd aw and np respectively this may involve in particular at nd a different water balance closure partitioning with less water lost through et floor groundwater use by vegetation at the nd and aw reserves illustrates the important role that groundwater resources may have in supporting tree transpiration in urban areas where arduous growing conditions and abiotic stress factors such as heat stress and low moisture conditions affect the health of trees several studies have detected similar behaviors but commonly with reference to large bio diverse ecosystems and often in natural environments or environments mildly affected by human activities e g fan et al 2014 fan et al 2016 balugani et al 2017 in this study groundwater transpiration t gw was estimated to contribute about 30 40 of total t in the driest period of the year this is consistent with the findings from other studies showing that groundwater was a source of water for vegetation orellana et al 2012 the annual value of t gw is difficult to estimate precisely because of the assumptions in the definition of eq 4 the difficulties in the estimation of s y gehman et al 2009 dietrich et al 2018 and the lack of information on the groundwater flows in and out of the reserves introduce uncertainties in the estimation of t gw loheide et al 2005 however the water table patterns during dry periods and the sustained transpiration rates during and following warm nights strongly support the assumption that trees are using groundwater at nd and aw as shown in drake et al 2018 water availability played an essential role during heat events during the study period the monitored trees successfully coped with warm summer nights with temperatures above 25 c and did not lose their hydraulic functions in particular t n ranged from 3 to 16 of the daily transpiration which is comparable to those found in eucalyptus woodland in western australia 15 20 dawson et al 2007 and in new south wales 6 8 and up to 19 on some days zeppel et al 2010 fan et al 2016 5 conclusion urbanization and the associated land use changes greatly impact natural ecosystems causing small natural reserves in urban areas to face changes in their hydrologic regime this study provides a comprehensive analysis of the water balance and tree water use dynamics over a two year period in three urban reserves hosting remnant native vegetation and experiencing different rainfall patterns in melbourne australia the water balances 2017 2018 showed that the three urban reserves had enough water to sustain transpiration rates despite the urban surrounding two of the reserves of this study appeared to be dependent on groundwater and the other one relied on water stored in a clay layer of its duplex soil groundwater played an essential role in sustaining transpiration rates during the driest periods of the year transpiration from groundwater was estimated to be about 30 40 of the total transpiration during warm nights following days with temperatures above 35 c groundwater allows trees to transpire between 3 and 16 of the total daily transpiration therefore these results highlight the importance of soil water resources in urban areas to support green spaces in future studies more attention should be given to quantify groundwater dynamics in urban areas to understand how changes in water table due to urbanization and climate variations may impact groundwater dependent vegetation a quantification of groundwater fluxes to and from the reserves would helped better constrain the transpiration from the understorey i e et floor longer series of sap flow measurements and tree diameter variations would also support a better understanding of how trees respond to different forms of stress understanding the water requirements of urban reserves may assist government authorities in improving management effectiveness

6350,during the expansion of urban areas small natural reserves have often been left intact within the built environment as central elements of biodiversity conservation ecological connectivity landscape sustainability and quality of life of urban dwellers consequently the surrounding urbanized landscape may impact the environmental conditions of these reserves e g high temperatures low moisture conditions resulting in the need for extensive maintenance this study presents an estimation of the water balance over two years 2017 2018 in three small urban reserves between 2 and 30 ha within the greater melbourne metropolitan area in australia for the purpose of understanding tree water use measurements of micrometeorological variables soil moisture content profiles water table levels sap flow velocities and stem diameter variations were used to quantify the water sources of tree transpiration in these reserves results revealed that despite the urban surroundings and the climate variations these reserves have enough water to sustain tree transpiration in two of the three reserves groundwater was pivotal in sustaining transpiration rates specifically groundwater was estimated to contribute about 30 40 of the total transpiration amount during the driest periods of the year groundwater also played an essential role during nights with temperatures above 25 c helping trees to maintain night time water use from 3 to 16 of the daily water use in the third reserve the presence of a shallow layer of heavy clay supplied water to the trees which were able to maintain relatively constant transpiration rates throughout the year these results demonstrate the importance of understanding the water regime of each urban reserve in order to support government authorities

impacts on the remaining vegetation by imposing changes in the radiation and energy budget the hydrologic regime and ecosystem composition and structure roberts 1977 sieghardt et al 2005 specifically increased temperatures and lower air humidity due to the uhi often expose the trees embedded in the urban landscape to high atmospheric evaporative demand this can lead to higher transpiration rates in particular when soil moisture is not a limiting factor litvak et al 2011 chen et al 2011 litvak and pataki 2016 zipper et al 2017 litvak et al 2017 asawa et al 2017 the increase of impervious surfaces and the introduction of drainage infrastructure lead to greater rates and volumes of surface runoff and reduce the volume of water which infiltrates the soils decreasing the water available

urban trees resulting in the decline of their health conditions during heat events being photosynthesis and stomatal conductance strongly coupled net rates of leaf photosynthesis and transpiration are expected to decline toward zero due to the high temperatures and vapor pressure deficit vpd recent studies however found that cooling of leaves by transpiration might be an important component to

endter wada et al 2008 mccarthy and pataki 2010 pataki et al 2011 in the greater melbourne metropolitan area australia for instance large areas of native vegetation have been replaced by urban and suburban landscapes over the past decades delwp 2016 the consequences for the native plants are substantial with less than 4 cover of native vegetation remaining within the urban growth boundary bradshaw 2012 hahs and mcdonnell 2014 this remaining native vegetation is severely fragmented into small reserves which become isolated and sometimes degraded moreover a further decline in vegetation health have been documented during the millennium drought that occurred approximately between 2001 and 2009 van dijk et al 2013 in this context maximizing the effectiveness of remnant native vegetation conservation through active management is important to avoid further losses of vegetation associated with urbanization therefore there is an increasing need for empirical evidence of the role that water availability and the built landscape play in the physiological response of vegetation to urban conditions livesley et al 2016 more information is also needed to understand the water requirements of these green spaces enabling better design management guidelines for the preservation of these ecosystems this involves the identification of the water resources that are most important

temperate climate köppen climate classification cfa with a strong spatial heterogeneity of rainfall within the metropolitan area decreasing from south east to north west the study focused on three urban reserves hosting predominantly remnant native vegetation with occasionally introduced species national drive reserve and alex wilkie reserve are embedded in the south eastern suburbs while napier park is located about 9 km north west of the melbourne central business district cbd fig 1 a national drive reserve nd covers an area of 14 ha and is located about 40 km from the melbourne cbd the area consists of a large stand of eucalyptus camaldulensis river red gum woodland with the understory dominated by pasture grasses the soil is predominantly silty clay in the first 40 cm followed by clay with the water table depth ranging between 3 and 4 m below the ground surface long term average annual rainfall is 757 148 mm mean sd mean minimum temperature is 10 0 c and mean maximum temperature is 19 8 c 1968 2018 bureau of meteorology bom station 086224 the station 086077 located at about 10 km from nd was also used to fill extensive data gaps in daily temperature series alex wilkie nature reserve aw is a sandy plain woodland of about 1 8 ha located 10 km to the north west of national drive reserve the reserve is populated mostly with e viminalis coast manna gum and e cephalocarpa silver leafed stringybark with other natural and planted lower trees e g allocasuarina littoralis banksia marginata and shrubs the soil consists of loamy sand which becomes sandy clay to about 3 m below ground level and then silty sand at about 7 m below ground level the depth to groundwater ranges between 3 and 5 m below the ground surface long term average annual rainfall is 684 132 mm mean minimum temperature is 10 2 c and mean maximum temperature is 19 8 c 1968 2018 bom station 086077 napier park np 4 1 ha is home to a valuable population of e camaldulensis with a number of significant e melliodora yellow box texture contrast soils duplex cover the entire area of the reserve with the soil profile consisting of a sandy silt up to 0 6 m overlaying a heavy clay between 0 6 and 1 8 m followed by sandy silt again groundwater depth is about 20 m below the ground surface long term average annual rainfall is 557 119 mm mean minimum temperature is 10 0 c and mean maximum temperature is 20 4 c 1968 2018 bom station 086038 concerns over declining ecological condition of the existing remnant vegetation led to the installation of an extensive irrigation system utilizing stormwater harvesting irrigation commenced in january 2016 water delivery aims to recharge the soil stores for about 85 of the reserve responding to the site specific requirements of the remnant population of e camaldulensis which needs to be intermittently flooded 2 2 stand characteristics the study was conducted over the two year period from july 2016 to june 2018 several 50 m 50 m plots were selected in each reserve covering a range of vegetation and environmental conditions e g moisture conditions fig 1 stand density stems ha 1 for each plot was calculated from tree count and area taking into account both live and dead trees total basal area ba m2ha 1 was estimated by measuring diameter at breast height dbh at 1 3 m from the ground of all trees alive and dead with stems larger than 10 cm in diameter including multi stemmed trees percentage of live basal area lba was then calculated as the proportion of the total basal area contributed by live trees 2 3 micrometeorology micrometeorological data including rainfall p air temperature t a relative humidity rh and incoming shortwave solar radiation r s were measured every 15 minutes using automatic weather stations aws campbell scientific daily vapor pressure deficit vpd was calculated from t a and rh measurements were conducted in appropriate open grassy areas within nd and aw reserves for the entire period of the study at np a weather station was placed within a private garden adjacent to the park between november 2016 to february 2017 the data collected from the site specific weather stations were combined with the data from the closest bom weather stations i e bom stations 086224 for nd 086077 for aw and 086038 for np to estimate long term 1968 2018 average annual rainfall and temperature for all sites to fill data gaps in the rainfall time series recorded at nd between july to december 2016 and aw in march and july 2017 as well as from september 2017 to june 2018 and to integrate the limited time series of micrometeorological data available from the aws installed at np i e from november 2016 to february 2017 comparing the bom data with the data recorded at nd aw and np using aws a good agreement was found in terms of monthly rainfall for nd r2 0 84 and in terms of weekly and monthly rainfall for aw r2 0 86 and 0 94 respectively and np r2 0 74 and 0 81 respectively therefore bom data were used to fill gaps in the data collected from the site specific weather stations 2 4 soil water and groundwater soil volumetric water content θ and soil temperature were measured every 15 minutes using fully encapsulated soil water capacitance probes drill drop sentek these probes measure the volumetric water content through sensors fixed at 10 cm increments from the surface to a depth of 120 cm five probes were installed at nd three at aw and six at np measurements were validated using the gravimetric method with oven drying o kelly 2004 which involves the collection using a sampling ring of soil samples around the probes at different measuring depths in our specific case soil samples were collected at 5 cm and 15 cm depths as deeper soil layers could not be reached due to the nature of the soils at all sites the samples were then used to estimate dry mass and bulk density i e dry mass of the soil in the given sampling volume the latter showing variations with depth ρ bulk 5 cm 1 1 0 2 g cm 3 ρ bulk 15 cm 1 4 0 1 g cm3 good agreement was found between θ measured with the drill drop sensors and that estimated from the volumetric soil sample analysis in the first 20 cm of soil water table depth relative to the ground surface was measured at 15 min intervals in monitoring bores at nd 11 1 m depth and aw 9 m depth each bore was equipped with a water level datalogger 3001 lt levelogger edge solinist and a barometric datalogger 3001 lt barologger edge solinist to enable specific barometric compensation manual water level measurements were conducted on a regular basis using a dip meter dipper t heron instrument inc to validate the water level measurements uncertainties related to the measurements of θ in the top 1 2 m of soil i e 0 03 and water table depths i e 0 05 were not considered in the water balance as annual changes in θ and water table depths were small compared to the other components of the water balance 2 5 sap flow measurements and stand transpiration water use of individual trees was determined using commercially available sap flow sensors sfm1 ict international australia which use the heat pulse velocity hpv technique to measure high low and reverse rates of sap flow from the velocity of a short pulse of heat moving along the xylem tissue hpv was recorded at half hourly intervals in several trees within the reserves and corrected for wounding effects following burgess et al 2001 wound widths were obtained from data in the literature collected for similar trees sensors were placed approximately at breast height 1 30 m from the ground on a total of twelve trees four at each site table 1 because the reserves are open to the public the number of trees selected could not be larger and remain inconspicuous measurements were converted to sap flux density sfd cm3cm 2 h 1 based on wood core measurements of dry wood density gravimetric sapwood moisture content and sapwood area calculated from stem diameter and thickness of sapwood and bark during warm summer nights with temperatures above 25 c and consequent high vpd forster 2014 the magnitude of night time sfd sfd n was estimated as a proportion of the 24 h sap flow considering sfd n from 23 00 to 05 00 following the method proposed by zeppel et al 2010 plot level transpiration t plot was calculated from the water use of individual trees using the linear relationship r2 0 86 p 0 05 between dbh cm and sapwood area a sapwood cm2 established based on the twelve selected trees across the three study sites fig 2 estimates of t plot mm h 1 were thus calculated as 1 t plot sfd avg a t a plot 10 4 2 a t i 1 n 10 02 dbh i 91 90 where a t is the total sapwood area in a plot cm2 sfd avg is the average area weighted sfd mm h 1 of the measured trees in the plot and n is the number of trees within the 50 m 50 m plot area a plot m2 the transpiration at the scale of the reserve t was estimated by averaging t plot for all measurement plots within each study site potential errors in the measurements of sfd using hpv sensors might lead to an underestimation of the actual sfd of up to 35 after wound correction these errors increase with sfd and are mainly caused by heterogeneity of the sapwood steppe et al 2010 additional errors may occur during the scaling of measurements from a single point to the whole tree due to the radial and circumferential variability in sap flux density the magnitude of this error mainly depends on the width of the sapwood area nadezhdina et al 2002 the hpv technique is recognized to be the most accurate when compared to the thermal dissipation peters et al 2018 and heat field deformation methods estimates of transpiration from stem sap flow data should also include a lag coefficient to account for the withdrawal of water from internal storage several studies demonstrated that 10 to 15 of daily transpiration may be provided by stem water stores e g meinzer et al 2004 matheny et al 2015 however because the dynamics of stored water affect mainly the patterns of intra daily transpiration matheny et al 2015 they have not been taken into account in this study 2 6 stem diameter variation measurements a total of six trees among the ones monitored with sap flow sensors were also equipped with band dendrometers dbl60 ict international australia to measure tree diameters over time table 1 the dbl60 sensors were fixed to the tree trunk with a 12 mm wide stainless steel tape at about 1 3 m height on the southern side of the tree a portion of the outermost bark was removed prior to installation to provide an undisturbed point of contact for the tape stem diameter variation sdv and temperature were recorded every 5 minutes sdv signals were then corrected for sensor temperature sensitivity applying an average thermal expansion coefficient of 1 17 10 6 μ m μ m c 1 according to vandegehuchte et al 2014 2 7 water balance an estimation of the water balance of each reserve was conducted out for 2 years july 2016 to june 2017 referred to as 2017 water year and july 2017 to june 2018 referred to as 2018 water year using 3 p t δ s q et where p is rainfall t is tree

errors including systematic errors in the estimates of the water budget variables all terms of eq 3 are expressed in equivalent water depths per unit of ground area mm the equation was used to estimate et δ s sw d for each site on a water year basis q being negligible in all study sites the change in soil water storage δ s sw s was calculated as the average change in volumetric water content in the soil profile at each measurement point i e the average water content for the 12 sensors over the length of the probe the change in groundwater storage δ s gw was calculated only for nd and aw reserves as the change in water table depth between consecutive years multiplied by the specific yield the specific yield was estimated as a function of the sediment texture as recommended for depths to the water table greater than 1 m loheide et al 2005 in particular the specific yield at nd was estimated as 2 and 7 at aw as in johnson 1963 deeper roots also extend below the depth to which soil water probes were installed reaching the water table or its capillary fringe to quantify the groundwater uptake t gw by trees in the sites where plants have access to groundwater the method developed by white white 1932 and later refined by loheide et al 2005 was used accordingly 4 t gw s y 24 r s where s y is the specific yield r mm h 1 is the rate of water table rise from midnight to 4 a m and s mm is the rise or fall of the groundwater level over a 24 h period i e from midnight to midnight the method was applied during rain free periods of few days for which water levels in the bores during the night can be reasonably assumed to be due to a net recovery flux toward the bore orellana et al 2012 3 results 3 1 stand characteristics stand characteristics differed significantly across reserves as well as between plots within the same reserve table 1 nd was overall the more dense site 248 704 stems ha 1 with a woodland structure that varied from east to west across the reserve higher basal area was found in plots nd1 ca 41 m2 ha 1 and nd4 39 m2 ha 1 in the north east and south east parts of the site respectively in all plots living trees accounted for more than 90 of the total basal area with a size about 2 2 times larger than dead trees the woodland structure at aw reserve varied from west to east with a higher stand density in the aw1 plot 600 stems ha 1 compared to the aw2 plot 428 stems ha 1 aw1 plot is also characterized by the highest abundance of large trees 16 trees ha 1 within the reserve however in both plots living and dead trees had similar dbh distributions at np dead trees were on average 1 5 times larger than live trees and the mean basal area for the four plots was 19 0 9 m2 ha 1 mean sd the live tree distribution at napier park was dominated by trees with a dbh of 0 15 0 17 m with few very large trees dbh 0 6 m 3 2 water balance seasonal patterns of t a r s and vpd were similar across all study sites during the two year study period fig 3 compared to the alternate year mean temperatures were higher during november 2017 and january and february 2018 with the last two months characterized by a large number of very warm nights having temperatures over 25 c the environmental factors r s and vpd influencing tree transpiration strengthened from winter to summer with r s characterized by monthly means ranging between 4 and 25 mj m 2 and monthly means of vpd varying from 1 to 2 5 kpa the maximum recorded hourly mean r s was 1200 w m 2 in summer and 520 w m 2 during winter for aw and np and 910 w m 2 in summer to 415 w m 2 in winter for nd the average maximum recorded vpd in an hour ranged from 7 4 kpa nd 6 1 aw and 5 95 np during summer 2018 to 1 8 kpa for all sites during winter 2018 lower values were recorded during summer and winter 2017 rainfall p did not display a marked seasonal variation but varied significantly among the study sites for both the 2017 and 2018 water years decreasing as expected from west to east fig 4 a during the 2017 water year rainfall was close to the 50 year average with winter and spring above average the 2018 water year was drier than average despite the wetter months of december and january fig 4a fig 3 observed transpiration t at reserve scale fig 3 displayed a distinct seasonal pattern particularly at nd where higher tree density overall led to higher transpiration rates transpiration ranged from 11 5 mm month 1 in june 2017 to 40 8 mm month 1 in january 2018 with an average of 26 2 mm month 1 lower transpiration rates were measured in aw where dbh are much lower than nd transpiration at aw ranged from 12 2 mm month 1 in june 2017 to 22 4 mm month 1 in january 2018 with an average of 17 6 mm month 1 transpiration rates in different months at np were similar in the two years with an average transpiration of about 7 5 mm month 1 temporal averaged θ calculated as the mean of all the measurements over the study period in each site shows different soil moisture profiles in the sites fig 4b shallow layers of soil remained relatively dry at aw θ 0 05 m3 m 3 with a more pronounced response to rainfall events at depths of about 1 m particularly for the wetter year 2017 conversely at nd and np θ in shallow layers varied more compared to deeper layers three distinct soil zones could be identified at np very dry topsoil increasingly wet layers between 0 3 to 0 6 m and near saturated layers below these profiles clearly reflect the profile of soil texture at the three sites water table depth fig 5 at aw had a visible seasonal cycle with recharge from rainfall occurring between september and december at nd groundwater appeared to be less sensitive to rainfall but conversely the effects of prolonged rain free periods were more pronounced in particular an increase of 0 35 m in the depth to groundwater table was recorded during the 20 days without rain between february and march 2017 and an increase of 0 18 m was measured during the 14 day rain free period in march 2018 the data of p t θ and water table levels were used to estimate the water balance of the reserves table 2 with considerable inter annual and inter site variability in the water balance components during the two years 2017 2018 nd received about 789 mm of rain while for the irrigated site i e np the total amount of incoming water including both the annual precipitation and the irrigation water was 100 mm despite more rainfall during 2017 than during 2018 the site averaged transpiration was quite similar for the two years of study of this rainfall about 297 332 mm 42 45 of the annual rainfall was returned to the atmosphere through tree transpiration at nd 205 210 mm 31 35 at aw and only 85 91 mm 14 18 at np accounting for the high dependency of plot level transpiration on the number of live trees table 1 among the three study sites aw experienced in 2017 a strong soil water depletion in the first 1 2 m of monitored soil 60 mm with a pronounced recharge to groundwater 16 mm the opposite behavior was recorded in 2018 when a considerable decline of δ s gw 31 mm occurred while the water content of the unsaturated zone increased δ s sw s increased overall at nd 15 mm in 2017 and 9 mm in 2018 whereas small variations were observed with respect to δ s gw taking into account only δ s sw s np showed a response similar to aw with a decline in 2017 and an increase in 2018 the annual water balance closure et δ s sw varied from 351 to 588 mm yr 1 representing 56 75 and 96 of p during the wet year 2017 and 53 66 and 88 during the dry year 2018 for nd aw and np respectively these values are further discussed in section 4 3 3 groundwater uptake by vegetation diurnal fluctuations in the depth to the groundwater table were observed during several rain free days for both 2017 and 2018 at nd fig 6 a and fig 6c as sfd increased during the daylight hours the depth to groundwater table declined while during the night a reduction in tree transpiration coincided with a rise in the water table indicating a recovery flux toward the bore these patterns of water table are often associated with groundwater uptake by tree roots for transpiration loheide et al 2005 orellana et al 2012 a total of 8 days were selected within the two prolonged rain free periods in 2017 and 2018 using eq 4 groundwater uptake t gw was estimated to range between 0 4 and 1 1 mm d 1 for a total of 5 mm during the 2017 rain free period and between 0 04 and 0 6 mm d 1 for a total of 2 6 mm during the 2018 rain free period therefore about 42 sd 16 and 29 sd 15 of transpiration was estimated to be from groundwater in those periods fig 6b and fig 6d it was not possible to detect a clear diurnal water table signal at aw the delay in the downward propagation of air pressure through the pores of the unsaturated zone generated water fluctuations in the bore that overshadowed the diurnal signal examining the trends in soil water content fig 4b and transpiration rates during the prolonged rain free periods in 2017 and 2018 suggested that transpiration rates were not limited by the modest soil water availability the diurnal shrinking and swelling of the tree trunk for ev1 along with sustained sfd also supported the presence of t gw at aw fig 7 swelling started in the late afternoon when the evaporative demand decreased considerably and continued throughout the night due to the water uptake as evapotranspiration demand increased during the daylight hours shrinkage occurred the contribution of groundwater uptake to the total transpiration was quantified by estimating the change in water table depth attributed to the specific rain free period using this method a total of 2 8 mm of t gw was estimated for the 8 days between february and march 2017 being about 47 of total transpiration a small data gap did not allow t gw to be estimated for the 2018 summer rain free period 3 4 night time tree water use warm summer nights with temperatures above 25 c following days with temperatures above 35 c occurred a few times within the two years of this study in most circumstances trees under observation coped well with these short heat events and did not lose their hydraulic functions substantial night time sfd was recorded in both ev1 and ev3 during the nights between 7 and 8 of january and between 8 and 9 of february 2017 fig 8 a and fig 8d the high temperatures on these nights were associated with consequent high vpd which likely led to transpiration during the night during the two recorded warm summer nights sfd n was found to be about 11 ev1 and 16 ev3 of the daily water use for january 2017 and about 3 ev1 and 13 ev3 for february 2017 measurements of diurnal shrinking and swelling of the tree trunk also verified the presence of night time water use during the first warm night swelling usually occurring near sunset when the evaporative demand decreased coincided with a reduced amplitude due to the night time transpiration causing an even larger shrinkage when the evaporative demand increased during the following daylight hours fig 8b and fig 8c this phenomenon was also present during the second warm night even though recent rainfall events affected the diurnal signal of dbh fig 8e and fig 8f 4 discussion this study attempts to understand and quantify the water balance and tree water use of small urban reserves in two of the study sites i e nd and aw groundwater was found to play an essential role in supporting tree transpiration especially during the driest periods of the year and heat events at np groundwater not being easily accessible the water stored in the shallow clay layer of the duplex soil supported transpiration rates as observed in other similar conditions verma et al 2014 observed transpirations rates were found to be comparable to estimates from other eucalyptus stands in natural areas e g zeppel et al 2006 doody et al 2015 transpiration rates at nd ranged from 1 3 to 0 5 mm day 1 during summer and winter while at aw they were from 0 9 to 0 25 mm day 1 at np t ranged between 0 3 mm day 1 during summer and 0 1 mm day 1 in winter in both years t was about 44 nd 33 aw and 16 np of total annual rainfall showing large inter site variability due to different natural rainfall regimes and stand density table table 1 table 2 on the contrary small inter annual variability was observed although annual rainfall in 2018 was about 15 lower than 2017 in both years a large portion of the water balance closure was attributed to et i e et floor e i and δ s sw d the magnitude of et and δ s sw d can be estimated from previous studies conducted on similar vegetation cover and hydrologic regime benyon and doody 2015 specifically et floor may represent more than 50 of total et zeppel et al 2006 and about 23 37 of the annual rainfall benyon and doody 2015 whereas e i may be between 15 to 26 of the total annual rainfall dunin et al 1988 farrington and bartle 1991 hutley et al 2000 bulcock and jewitt 2012 accordingly considering et floor e i about 50 of the annual rainfall this term accounted for 89 nd 66 aw and 52 np of the water balance closure for the 2017 water year and 94 nd 75 aw and 57 np for the 2018 water year these estimates support the water balance in table 2 especially for nd in which δ s sw d is expected to be small due to the clayey nature of the soil which enhances the capillary rise up to the monitored soil layers as also shown in fig 4b at aw higher proportions of interception losses e i should be considered due to the dense understory cover as well higher δ s sw d may be expected because of the highly sandy soil which increases the movement of water beyond the monitored soil profile at np the water balance was only conducted for the monitored soil 0 1 2 m with δ s sw d representing the downward drainage below this depth at this site extensive grassy and bare soil areas may also contribute to a larger percentage of floor evaporation most of the uncertainties in the estimates of the water balance components are related to the underestimation of canopy transpiration accounting for an underestimation of t of 35 would result in an annual water balance closure of 41 65 and 91 of p during 2017 and 38 54 and 81 in 2018 for nd aw and np respectively this may involve in particular at nd a different water balance closure partitioning with less water lost through et floor groundwater use by vegetation at the nd and aw reserves illustrates the important role that groundwater resources may have in supporting tree transpiration in urban areas where arduous growing conditions and abiotic stress factors such as heat stress and low moisture conditions affect the health of trees several studies have detected similar behaviors but commonly with reference to large bio diverse ecosystems and often in natural environments or environments mildly affected by human activities e g fan et al 2014 fan et al 2016 balugani et al 2017 in this study groundwater transpiration t gw was estimated to contribute about 30 40 of total t in the driest period of the year this is consistent with the findings from other studies showing that groundwater was a source of water for vegetation orellana et al 2012 the annual value of t gw is difficult to estimate precisely because of the assumptions in the definition of eq 4 the difficulties in the estimation of s y gehman et al 2009 dietrich et al 2018 and the lack of information on the groundwater flows in and out of the reserves introduce uncertainties in the estimation of t gw loheide et al 2005 however the water table patterns during dry periods and the sustained transpiration rates during and following warm nights strongly support the assumption that trees are using groundwater at nd and aw as shown in drake et al 2018 water availability played an essential role during heat events during the study period the monitored trees successfully coped with warm summer nights with temperatures above 25 c and did not lose their hydraulic functions in particular t n ranged from 3 to 16 of the daily transpiration which is comparable to those found in eucalyptus woodland in western australia 15 20 dawson et al 2007 and in new south wales 6 8 and up to 19 on some days zeppel et al 2010 fan et al 2016 5 conclusion urbanization and the associated land use changes greatly impact natural ecosystems causing small natural reserves in urban areas to face changes in their hydrologic regime this study provides a comprehensive analysis of the water balance and tree water use dynamics over a two year period in three urban reserves hosting remnant native vegetation and experiencing different rainfall patterns in melbourne australia the water balances 2017 2018 showed that the three urban reserves had enough water to sustain transpiration rates despite the urban surrounding two of the reserves of this study appeared to be dependent on groundwater and the other one relied on water stored in a clay layer of its duplex soil groundwater played an essential role in sustaining transpiration rates during the driest periods of the year transpiration from groundwater was estimated to be about 30 40 of the total transpiration during warm nights following days with temperatures above 35 c groundwater allows trees to transpire between 3 and 16 of the total daily transpiration therefore these results highlight the importance of soil water resources in urban areas to support green spaces in future studies more attention should be given to quantify groundwater dynamics in urban areas to understand how changes in water table due to urbanization and climate variations may impact groundwater dependent vegetation a quantification of groundwater fluxes to and from the reserves would helped better constrain the transpiration from the understorey i e et floor longer series of sap flow measurements and tree diameter variations would also support a better understanding of how trees respond to different forms of stress understanding the water requirements of urban reserves may assist government authorities in improving management effectiveness

6351,the generation of hydrometeorological time series that exhibit a given probabilistic and stochastic behavior across multiple temporal levels traditionally expressed in terms of specific statistical characteristics of the observed data is a crucial task for risk based water resources studies and simultaneously a puzzle for the community of stochastics the main challenge stems from the fact that the reproduction of a specific behavior at a certain temporal level does not imply the reproduction of the desirable behavior at any other level of aggregation in this respect we first introduce a pairwise coupling of nataf based stochastic models within a disaggregation scheme and next we propose their puzzle type configuration to provide a generic stochastic simulation framework for multivariate processes exhibiting any distribution and any correlation structure within case studies we demonstrate two characteristic configurations i e a three level one operating at daily monthly and annual basis and a two level one to disaggregate daily to hourly data the first configuration is applied to generate correlated daily rainfall and runoff data at the river basin of achelous western greece which preserves the stochastic behavior of the two processes at the three temporal levels the second configuration disaggregates daily rainfall obtained from a meteorological station at germany to hourly the two studies reveal the ability of the proposed framework to represent the peculiar behavior of hydrometeorological processes at multiple temporal resolutions as well as its flexibility on formulating generic simulation schemes keywords stochastic processes nataf based models non gaussian distributions correlation structures multivariate simulation disaggregation 1 introduction today most water recourse studies employ monte carlo simulations by running deterministic models that are driven by synthetic inputs which are typically generated by stochastic models in this context the key requirement for extracting statistically consistent outcomes is the concise representation of the probabilistic behavior and stochastic structure of the input hydrometeorological processes e g rainfall runoff temperature it is well known that these exhibit a significantly complex regime the most prominent aspects of which are non gaussianity intermittency auto and cross dependence as well as periodicity koutsoyiannis 2005 moran 1970 salas et al 1980 all the above peculiarities dictate the specifications of a good simulation model actually the first two characteristics non gaussianity and intermittency are directly associated with the marginal properties of the process and imply the need for a suitable probability distribution model on the other hand auto and cross dependencies are associated with the stochastic joint properties of the process both in time and space and point out the need for stochastic simulation models per se in fact if the physical processes to simulate were not auto or cross correlated the problem would be substantially simpler as the production of synthetic data would be trivially made by generating uniform numbers and then employing probability integral transformations finally periodicity introduces further complexity since it implies representing the processes as cyclostationary thus differentiating their marginal and joint properties not only across different temporal scales but also across seasons or systematically repeated time intervals in general during more than a half century the need for good synthetic data generators to be used within risk aware decision making frameworks for design assessment and operation of water resource systems celeste billib 2009 feng et al 2017 giuliani et al 2014 haberlandt et al 2011 koutsoyiannis economou 2003 paschalis et al 2014 tsoukalas et al 2016 tsoukalas makropoulos 2015a b has triggered numerous researchers for developing a plethora of stochastic approaches and associated modelling tools these can be primarily classified into two broad categories i e single scale and multi scale the former ensure the reproduction of a set of statistical and stochastic properties at a unique time scale of interest i e the time interval of simulation while the latter attempt to simultaneously represent the desirable properties of the simulated data as well as the properties of the aggregated data at coarser temporal scales the numerous single scale simulation schemes that have been developed so far can be further classified into 1 linear stochastic models also known as time series generators e g bras rodríguez iturbe 1985 koutsoyiannis 1999 2000 matalas wallis 1976 matalas 1967 salas et al 1980 thomas fiering 1962 2 point process models bo et al

1999 wójcik buishand 2003 and 5 copula based models e g bárdossy pegram 2009 chen et al 2015 hao singh 2011 2013 jeong lee 2015 lee 2017 lee salas 2011 serinaldi 2009 by design single scale simulation models attempt to reproduce the desirable statistical and stochastic behavior within the synthetic data at the scale of simulation yet they provide limited control to the properties of the same process when aggregated at higher coarser time scales it is well known that the reproduction of the probabilistic and stochastic behavior of a process expressed either in terms of a distribution function or a set of statistical properties at a certain time scale does not ensure the reproduction of the associated characteristics of the aggregated process at any other time scale the necessity for multi scale consistency has been early recognized by the hydrological community through the pioneering work by harms and campbell 1967 actually from the first steps of monte carlo approaches in water resources it has been accepted that that the outcomes of stochastic analyses are associated with the overall statistical and stochastic behavior of the input hydrometeorological processes which may extend far beyond the time interval of the underlying deterministic simulation model see klemeš 1981 koutsoyiannis 2005 for instance the design and operation of large reservoir systems that employ overyear regulation which are typically modelled in monthly intervals is strongly dictated by the probabilistic and stochastic properties of the aggregated inflows at the annual and even over annual scales similarly the outputs of continuous flood simulation models driven by fine time e g hourly rainfall series are substantially affected by the sequence of accumulated rainfall as the runoff production strongly depends on the antecedent soil moisture conditions in this respect multi scale consistency in stochastic simulation can be regarded as an operational sine qua non furthermore multi scale consistency is directly linked with the so called issue of low frequency variability or over dispersion i e the deficiency to reproduce the process variance at higher time scales which is encountered in many popular daily weather generation models e g baigorria jones 2010 breinl et al 2013 2015 brissette et al 2007 katz parlange 1998 khalili et al 2009 lee 2017 mehrotra et al 2006 mhanna bauwens 2012 serinaldi 2009 srikanthan pegram 2009 wilks 1998 wilks wilby 1999 multi scale simulation schemes with the exception of few specifically designed models e g langousis koutsoyiannis 2006 rodriguez iturbe et al 1987 is typically built upon the disaggregation paradigm the essential element of disaggregation is the additive property which enables the generation of multi scale consistent time series via the transfer of information among different temporal scales this implies that the sum of the generated variables at the lower level e g monthly at any period should add to the corresponding value at the higher level e g annual which is assumed known either from observed or synthetic simulated data this property distinguishes disaggregation from downscaling e g cannon 2008 lombardo et al 2012 wilks wilby 1999 which focus on generating lower level time series that statistically resemble the properties of higher level ones and not necessarily honor the additive constraint as already mentioned the beginning of the quest at least in hydrological domain for multi scale simulation models can be attributed to harms and campbell 1967 who developed a two level version of the classical stochastic model by thomas and fiering 1962 that preserves some key statistical properties of the observed data at both the annual and monthly scale a little later the interest on such methods reinforced with the theoretical research on disaggregation by valencia and schakke 1973 and mejia and rousselle 1976 however the proposed methods were fully general only for normally distributed variables thus limiting their applicability to a relatively narrow range of processes and scales the next generation approaches offered multi scale schemes that utilized the notion of the so called adjusting procedures grygier stedinger 1988 harms campbell 1967 koutsoyiannis 2001 koutsoyiannis manetas 1996 stedinger vogel 1984 these aimed at coupling single scale simulation models of any type operating independently at different time scales the rationale is generating low level synthetic data as auxiliary information and next adjusting them to the known higher level values by using relatively simple algebraic transformations such as the partial sums at the low level equal the values of the higher level koutsoyiannis and manetas 1996 and koutsoyiannis 2001 investigated several adjusting procedures and also standardized the concept of repetitive sampling kind of monte carlo approach to ensure that the partial sums are close to the given values this can be regarded as an informal method of conditional sampling that can significantly improve the efficiency of such schemes for an early formulation of this idea see glasbey et al 1995 adjusting procedures of varying complexity have been implemented within a number of disaggregation based schemes in order to couple single scale simulation models such as the ones described above across various time scales in particular they were used within linear stochastic models e g allard bourotte 2015 efstratiadis et al 2014 koutsoyiannis et al 2003 lombardo et al 2012 segond et al 2006 tsoukalas et al 2018b point processes e g glasbey et al 1995 kossieris et al 2015 2016 koutsoyiannis onof 2001 onof et al 2005 two part models evin et al 2018 shao et al 2016 resampling methods e g breinl di baldassarre 2019 lee et al 2010 li et al 2018 and copula based models e g gyasi agyei 2011 gyasi agyei melching 2012 it is highlighted that the overall simulation capabilities of adjusting based schemes are determined by the underlying simulation models which consist the core data generation mechanism in addition several modern schemes for establishing multi scale consistency are built upon the concepts of scaling and multifractality kantelhardt et al 2006 tessier et al 1996 veneziano et al 2006 typically these employ multiplicative random cascade models gupta waymire 1990 1993 to generate multi scale consistent in terms of typically high order moments realizations deidda et al 1999 menabde et al 1997 molnar burlando 2005 müller haberlandt 2015 2018 olsson 1998 rupp et al 2009 recent works by lombardo et al 2012 and pui et al 2012 provide comparative studies involving such models as well as alternative downscaling or disaggregation methods besides the vast effort made so far the quest for full generality and full consistency across multiple scales herein the focus is on temporal scales but may also concern spatial ones still remains a puzzle recently tsoukalas et al 2018a highlighted that many of widespread schemes including linear stochastic models with non gaussian innovations point process models and resampling techniques emphasize the reproduction of a specific set of summary statistical characteristics which arguably cannot capture the full behavior of a random process as also shown under some common conditions these may lead to bounded dependence patterns which are not realistic tsoukalas et al 2018d on the other hand two part and copula based models are actually able to explicitly account for the distributional properties of simulated processes yet they are mainly designed to represent specific correlation structures for instance two part models often neglect temporal dependencies while copula based schemes typically account for temporal dependencies spanning over only few time lags in this work our focus is not on disaggregation per se rather than we employ the flexibility provided by the concepts of repetitive sampling and adjusting procedures to link individual multivariate or univariate stochastic models in order to represent the varying regime of hydrometeorological processes across multiple temporal scales our emphasis is to shift from the classical paradigm of describing a process in terms of few summary statistics in particular moments up to third order and low order correlation coefficients to the explicit representation of its marginal and stochastic properties in terms of distribution functions and theoretical correlation structures respectively this is accomplished by building upon a recently introduced in hydrology class of stochastic models the so called nataf based models named after the contribution of nataf 1962 and the further developments by tsoukalas et al 2017 2018a c as well as by papalexiou 2018 these are able to simulate multivariate stationary and cyclostationary processes with any marginal distributions and any correlation structures these properties allow for characterizing nataf based models as good single scale stochastic simulators and thus appropriate data generators within multi scale adjusting based schemes taking advantage of the above concepts we propose a scale free disaggregation approach for the pairwise coupling of nataf based models aiming to preserve the desirable marginal distributions and correlation structures the proposed approach is next referred to as nataf based disaggregation to anything nda eventually a chain configuration of nda allows for developing puzzle type i e modular simulation schemes that ensure consistent simulations across any sequence of temporal scales a sequence may involve any combination of stochastic models stationary or cyclostationary this paper is organized as follows section 2 discusses the core generation procedure through nataf based stochastic models section 3 describes the disaggregation based coupling approach i e nda designed to maintain consistency across pairwise scales and section 4 presents the puzzle type multi level simulation scheme next two sections demonstrate two characteristic configurations of this puzzle particularly section 5 presents a three level multivariate scheme applied for generating synthetic rainfall and runoff data at the river basin of achelous greece on the other hand the configuration of section 6 aims at synthesizing hourly rainfall data from a given i e observed daily record thus illustrating the efficiency of the method against challenging disaggregation problems finally section 7 summarizes the overall modelling framework and discusses its potential applications and future improvements 2 nataf based stochastic models in a recent work tsoukalas et al 2018a highlighted the need for generalized generation schemes which are able to represent processes from any distribution and any correlation structure this has been also regarded as a shift in classical stochastic modelling emphasizing on the reproduction of a finite set of essential statistical characteristics cf matalas wallis 1976 estimated from the historical data an effective and efficient handling of this requirement is offered by the so called nataf based models tsoukalas 2019 tsoukalas et al 2017 2018a 2018c that use the notion of parent gaussian processes papalexiou 2018 as the name suggests these are built upon a quite old idea by nataf 1962 who proposed the non linear mapping of an auxiliary multivariate gaussian distribution in order to construct the joint distribution of random variables with arbitrary marginal distributions whose variance exists an assumption implied throughout this paper using a similar rationale it is possible to establish stochastic processes with any target marginal distribution and correlation structure expressed in terms of pearson s correlation coefficient through the mapping of an appropriately specified auxiliary stationary or cyclostationary gaussian process gp with zero mean and unit variance to which an equivalent correlation structure is assigned see details below the mapping operation is typically a non linear function often implemented through the inverse cumulative distribution function icdf these approaches can be viewed as gaussian copula based schemes since they rely on the mapping of a gaussian process or non linear versions of the classic i e gaussian linear stochastic schemes tsoukalas et al 2018c nataf based models have been widely employed within the domain of operations research e g biller nelson 2003 cario nelson 1996 and probabilistic engineering mechanics e g deodatis micaletti 2001 grigoriu 1998 while their application in hydrological modelling was until recently unknown beyond the aforementioned works see the work of kossieris et al 2019 who for the first time employed such models for the simulation of water demand processes at fine time scales interestingly similar ideas can be revealed in several classical hydrological papers cf review by tsoukalas et al 2018a and tsoukalas 2019 beyond the hydrological domain more details about the nataf s model as well as its relationship with the gaussian copula are provided by lebrun dutfoy 2009 herein we briefly discuss the theoretical background and key implementation steps of the proposed nataf based simulation approach also providing guidelines for its optimal use for convenience we first present the most involved modelling case of multivariate cyclostationary processes and next deal with the simpler case of stationary processes for demonstration we also present a hypothetical study involving the simulation of contemporaneous cross correlated processes we remark that throughout the paper the underbar notation e g x is used to denote a random variable rv while the italic typeface e g x denotes a realization of it 2 1 cyclostationary processes in general cyclostationarity is regarded as a special type of non stationarity that implies a cyclic switching on the marginal and joint characteristics of the process over a period e g year to elaborate let x s n be an m dimensional multivariate cyclostationary process each individual process x s n i is consisted of s 1 s sub periods e g months while n z denotes the time index the sub period i e season that corresponds to a time step n may be recovered by s n mod s while when n mod s 0 we get s s this process can also be written as x s t where now t z denotes the period e g year in this formulation the period t is related with the time index n and sub period s by t 1 n s s for convenience the first formulation will be employed in the following paragraphs due to cyclostationarity each process x s n i is characterized by seasonally varying herein referred to as target marginal distributions f x s i p x s i x while their correlation structure is expressed through the pearson s correlation coefficient ρ s s τ i j corr x s i x s τ j where τ denotes the time lag the index n is omitted for simplicity also let z s n denote an auxiliary m dimensional cyclostationary standard gp with z s i n 0 1 due to cyclostationarity the gp is completely defined by its correlation structure which is expressed through the so called equivalent correlation coefficients ρ s s τ i j corr z s i z s τ j the target process x s n can be established through the auxiliary process z s n via the mapping function 1 x s n i f x s i 1 φ z s n i where f x s i 1 denotes the icdf of f x s i and φ denotes the cumulative density function cdf of the standard gaussian distribution this mapping allow us to relate the target correlation coefficients ρ s s τ i j with the equivalent correlation coefficients ρ s s τ i j of the auxiliary gp tsoukalas et al 2017 2018a specifically they are related by 2 ρ s s τ i j f x s i 1 φ z s i f x s τ j 1 φ z s τ j φ 2 z s i z s τ j ρ s s τ i j d z s i d z s τ j e x s i e x s τ j v a r x s i v a r x s τ j where e and v a r denote the corresponding mean and variance known from the target distributions while φ 2 z s i z s τ j ρ s s τ i j stands for the bivariate standard normal probability density function pdf the relationship of eq 2 is abbreviated as 3 ρ s s τ i j f ρ s s τ i j f x s i f x s τ j 2 2 stationary processes a similar relationship can be established between a target multivariate stationary process x t and an auxiliary multivariate stationary standard gp z t particularly let x t be comprised of m univariate stationary processes x t i indexed using t z furthermore let each one be described by a target cdf f x i p x i x and let their correlation structure be expressed by ρ τ i j corr x t i x t τ j similarly the process z t is a m dimensional stationary standard gp with equivalent correlation structure ρ τ i j corr z t i z t τ j using a similar rationale to the cyclostationary case each target process is established by x t i f x i 1 φ z t i in this case the relationship between the target and equivalent correlation coefficients reads e g biller nelson 2003 tsoukalas et al 2018c 4 ρ τ i j f x i 1 φ z t i f x j 1 φ z t τ j φ 2 z t i z t τ j ρ τ i j d z t i d z t τ j e x i e x j v a r x i v a r x j which is abbreviated as 5 ρ τ i j f ρ τ i j f x i f x j both eqs 3 and 5 imply that the correlation structure of the target process depends on the target distributions and the equivalent correlation structure of the auxiliary gp we underline that the term equivalent is used to highlight the fact that the correlation coefficients of the target process and those of the auxiliary gp rarely coincide due to the non linear mapping operation see embrechts et al 1999 particularly it can be shown liu der kiureghian 1986 that for any pair of correlated rvs x i x j established through a pair of correlated gaussian rvs z i z j using a mapping operation analogous to eq 1 i e x i f x i 1 φ z i we get ρ i j ρ i j where ρ i j and ρ i j denote the target and equivalent i e in the gaussian domain correlation coefficients respectively cf fig 1 in tsoukalas et al 2018a 2 3 estimation of equivalent correlation coefficients given eqs 3 and 5 it is possible to establish a variety of approaches to simulate processes with a priori specified target marginal distributions and target correlation structures this specification is subject to several criteria which are discussed in sections 2 4 2 6 nevertheless an essential step for ensuring the reproduction of target correlations through eq 3 or eq 5 for cyclostationary and stationary processes respectively is the identification of the equivalent correlation coefficients this is implemented by establishing and then inverting the corresponding f relationships among the available methods e g biller nelson 2003 cario nelson 1996 1997 liu der kiureghian 1986 herein we will employ the monte carlo procedure by tsoukalas et al 2017 2018a due to its efficiency and straightforward implementation since it avoids the use of integration methods for a method comparison see tsoukalas et al 2018c 2 4 admissible marginal distributions as already explained nataf based models can be used for the simulation of processes with arbitrary continuous discrete or mixed type marginal distributions and valid correlation structures provided that their combination is feasible i e leads to a positive definite correlation structure and the variance of the distributions is finite which is true when modelling hydrometeorological processes koutsoyiannis 2016 regarding the marginal distributions and in contrast to the classical working paradigm of stochastic hydrology it is stressed that by design nataf based models do not aim at resembling the process s moments in fact they aim to simulate processes with target a priori specified distributions in order to fully describe their marginal properties cf discussion by tsoukalas et al 2018a in this respect questions about skewness handling or how many moments should be reproduced for approximating the distribution of a specific process are now out of interest for instance within nataf based schemes simulating a process following a gamma or log normal distribution requires the identification of just two parameters shape and scale which can be easily determined by straightforward methods even the classical method of product moments would ensure reliable estimations since in these specific cases it only requires computations up to second order lombardo et al 2014 in a more general context the nataf based approach offers the flexibility to employ robust fitting methods for parameter estimation that rely on alternative notions such as maximum likelihood probability weighted moments greenwood et al 1979 or l moments hosking 1990 in our view this is a major advantage since it can avoid the data driven estimation of high order moments e g kurtosis or higher since it is well known that they are prone to sample uncertainties and bias lombardo et al 2014 matalas 1967p 945 appendix a summarizes all distribution models employed in this work which were generally fitted using the l moments method 2 5 specific case mixed distributions mixed distributions are often advocated within hydrological applications either to better represent the tails of the understudy hydrometeorological variable e g evin et al 2018 foufoula georgiou lettenmaier 1987 furrer katz 2008 li et al 2013 wilks 1998 or to simultaneously represent the dual character of intermittent processes e g bárdossy pegram 2016 cannon 2008 papalexiou 2018 serinaldi 2009 tsoukalas et al 2018c williams 1998 herein we briefly describe the second case which can be accomplished using a zero inflated also referred to as zero augmented or discrete continuous distribution model this model is composed of both a discrete and a continuous part and its cdf is given by 6 f x x p d x 0 p d 1 p d g x x x 0 the discrete part is represented by p d p x 0 and denotes the probability of a zero value the continuous part is given by g x f x x 0 p x x x 0 which denotes a continuous distribution function for the non zero data for instance within the context of intermittent hydrometeorological processes e g rainfall p d stands for the probability of a dry interval i e probability dry and g x represents the distribution of positive amounts in real world situations the most straightforward way to specify p d and g x is through the available data specifically p d is estimated as the ratio of dry occurrences to the total number of observations while g x can be identified by fitting a continuous distribution function to the positive amounts for completeness the icdf of the zero inflated model which can be used for rvs generation is given by 7 f x 1 u 0 0 u p d g x 1 u p d 1 p d p d u 1 the implementation of eq 6 for simulating intermittent process in a context similar to nataf based models has been recently justified by papalexiou 2018 see also the similarly constructed three component distribution function employed by kossieris et al 2019 aiming to simultaneously describe both the discrete continuous character i e intermittent nature and tail behavior of water demand processes at fine time scales up to 1 minute 2 6 admissible correlation structures classical stochastic modelling strategies are designed to reproduce a limited number of low order dependence metrics in space and time typically expressed in terms of pearson s correlation coefficients actually most of them still follow the specifications posed by matalas and wallis 1976 thus aiming to reproduce just two dependencies i e lag 1 autocorrelations and lag 0 cross correlations we remark that herein the term spatial correlation will denote any dependence between different processes either referring to different geographical locations or not more modern approaches suggest the use of theoretical models for the mathematical description of the auto and cross dependence structures that span over any lag e g gneiting 2000 gneiting schlather 2004 koutsoyiannis 2000 2016 papalexiou 2018 these typically concern stationary processes and are based on the notions of correlation spectrum or variance over aggregated time scales which are all interrelated see beran 1994 koutsoyiannis 2016 the use of theoretical dependence models instead of sample statistics is mostly implied from the significant uncertainties and biases of data driven estimates arguably the most popular type of theoretical dependence models are correlation based ones these can be further classified to full spatiotemporal models chilès delfiner 1999 genton kleiber 2015 gneiting et al 2010 which simultaneously model the auto and cross correlation structure of the process and separable e g genton 2007 mardia goodall 1993 rodríguez iturbe mejía 1974 which describe the two correlation structures independently as the product of two functions i e one for the spatial and one for the temporal component throughout this work and without loss of generality since alternative models can be used we will employ the separable approach specifically we model directly the lag 0 contemporaneous cross correlations of the processes while the auto dependence structure of each individual stationary process is modelled using the two parameter cauchy type autocorrelation structure cas introduced by koutsoyiannis 2000 8 ρ τ c a s κ β 1 κ β τ 1 β τ 0 where β 0 and κ 0 are model parameters the specific case β 0 is also feasible through the use of l hôpital s rule and represents arma type processes see koutsoyiannis 2000 by construction cas can resemble a wide spectrum of processes characterized by both short and long range dependence i e srd and lrd e g efstratiadis et al 2014 tsoukalas et al 2018c srd refers to a stochastic process with a weak autocorrelation structure e g exponential that decays rapidly while lrd implies the exact opposite in this case the autocorrelation structure is a slowly decreasing function typically power type of the time lag beran 1994 beran et al 2013 koutsoyiannis 2002 o connell et al 2016 this type of auto dependence is also associated with the widely studied hurst phenomenon hurst 1951 nowadays also referred to as hurst kolmogorov hk dynamics koutsoyiannis 2011 koutsoyiannis montanari 2007 as well as with the fractional gaussian noise process e g mandelbrot wallis 1969 these properties and its parsimonious character as the model has only two parameters make cas a good candidate model for modelling hydrometeorological processes regarding parameter identification the most straightforward option is to fit cas to the empirical estimates of autocorrelation coefficients however this simple approach neglects the estimator s biases e g beran 1994 koutsoyiannis 2016 marriott pope 1954 which are considered to be significant in the presence of lrd and for large time lags due to small sample sizes in such cases it may be advantageous to explicitly account for bias by using alternative robust parameter identification procedures such as the climacogram e g dimitriadis koutsoyiannis 2015 koutsoyiannis 2016 or even through empirical approaches accounting for regional information and user expertise efstratiadis et al 2014 in summary the combined use of nataf based models along with theoretical distribution functions and theoretical correlation structures e g cas offers several advantages such as easy exploration of alternative scenarios by perturbing the models parameters regional transferability through spatial interpolation improved model stability since a valid correlation structure owes to be positive definite a fact guaranteed by a proper theoretical model decoupling of parameter identification involving the parameters of the distribution model and the theoretical correlation structure and generation mechanism 2 7 the auxiliary gaussian processes in order to deploy a nataf based stochastic simulation scheme it is finally required to simulate realizations from an auxiliary gaussian process gp model that preserves the equivalent correlation coefficients which in turn after the mapping procedure reproduces the target stochastic structure a convenient option is the use of gaussian linear stochastic models often called time series models characteristic examples adapted from operations research are the works of cario and nelson 1996 and biller and nelson 2003 who used as an auxiliary gp univariate and multivariate stationary autoregressive ar processes respectively the resulting nataf based models are termed autoregressive to anything arta and vector autoregressive to anything varta a notable difference of these works compared to our approach lies in the fact that the previous works did not employ the notion of theoretical correlation structures this implies that the order p of the associated ar model dictates the correlation structure of the process to simulate this may be also the reason for the typical use of low order models on the other hand if the auto correlation structure has been a priori specified e g using cas it is possible to employ high order models e g ar p without sacrificing parsimony in this case the order of the gp model solely controls the degree of resemblance of the correlation structure up to the desired lag τ since a higher order model provides more flexibility while the associated model s parameters can be viewed as internal coefficients for a bivariate example see section 2 9 in the water resources domain a comprehensive treatment of multivariate and univariate nataf based schemes based on stationary and cyclostationary gaussian linear stochastic models is presented by tsoukalas et al 2018c and tsoukalas et al 2017 2018a respectively as well as by papalexiou 2018 in this work aiming to develop a multi scale consistent simulation scheme see section 4 we employ and couple in a pairwise basis several nataf based models which use different gp models all of them also capable of multivariate simulations see the summary and the abbreviations of table 1 from the aforementioned models smarta and cmarta are designed for stationary processes while sparta for cyclostationary ones i e accounting for the season to season correlations a common characteristic of the three models is the direct reproduction of lag 0 cross correlations coefficient among multiple contemporaneous processes smarta and sparta are fully described in the works cited in table 1 while a detailed description of the auxiliary gaussian cmar p model is given in appendix b it is stressed that regardless of the choice of the auxiliary gp model in order to generate realizations with the equivalent correlation structure the model parameters have to be estimated using the equivalent correlation coefficients for this reason within the description of cmar p we employ the tilde notation see appendix b 2 8 brief overview via a step by step procedure for a given stochastic process univariate case or a set of processes multivariate case to simulate the required methodological steps of any nataf based model are step 1 identify the type i e stationary or cyclostationary of the processes accounting for process properties and the time scale of simulation step 2 based on the available information e g historical data as well as the user expertise assign appropriate target marginal distributions to all processes and identify the target correlation structure in time and case of multivariate simulation space step 3 select a suitable linear stochastic model to simulate the auxiliary gp step 4 estimate the equivalent correlation coefficients for all pairs of variables that are required by the parameter estimation procedure of the auxiliary model i e gp step 5 estimate the parameters of the gp model through the equivalent correlation coefficients step 6 generate a synthetic time series by employing the gp i e z t o r z s n step 7 map the auxiliary i e gaussian time series to the actual domain in order to attain a realization of the target process i e x t o r x s n the methodology and simulation models described in section 2 as briefly summarized by the above described step by step procedure has been implemented in the anysim r package tsoukalas and kossieris 2019 which enables the straightforward and easy generation of synthetic time series with any distribution and correlation structure 2 9 a hypothetical simulation example to enhance readability we employ cmarta p and setup three bivariate hypothetical simulation experiments hereafter termed a b and c that regard the simulation of two contemporaneously cross correlated stationary processes x t 1 and x t 2 with either zero inflated or discrete marginal distributions for convenience the three experiments share some common assumptions which are 1 the order of the auxiliary gaussian cmar p model which is set to be p 100 2 the length of the synthetic time series to simulate i e 100000 steps 3 the target lag 0 cross correlation coefficient i e ρ 0 1 2 0 70 and 4 the target auto dependence structure of each process which is provided by cas i e eq 8 i e x t 1 ρ τ cas 1 β 0 κ 0 67 and x t 2 ρ τ cas 2 β 1 2 κ 1 as briefly mentioned earlier and since the autocorrelation structure of the processes is already specified the use of a high order gp model i e cmar p in this example does not introduces additional parameters but solely controls the degree of resemblance of the target correlation structure particularly by setting p 100 the model will resemble the target cas up to time lag 100 while for τ 100 it will reduce according to its theoretical properties similarly if we employed a higher order model e g p 1000 we would resemble the target cas up to time lag τ 1000 without needing more parameters for the description of the autocorrelation structure the three simulation studies differ in terms of target marginal distributions of the individual processes more specifically in case a it is assumed that the marginal distribution is provided by a zero inflated model i e eq 6 with p d 0 80 and p d 0 75 for x t 1 and x t 2 respectively while the continuous part is given by the gamma g and log normal l n distribution eq a 1 and eq a 2 respectively particularly they are for x t 1 by g a 0 20 b 0 15 and for x t 2 by l n a 1 b 1 in case b the target distributions are regarded to be discrete and given by the poisson distribution p o i see also eq a 5 particularly we assume that x t 1 p o i λ 1 and x t 2 p o i λ 2 finally in case c we assigned a discrete type bernoulli distribution b e r n see eq a 6 specifically x t 1 b e r n p 0 8 and x t 2 b e r n p 0 75 case a can be considered as the most common simulation scenario since it involves the multivariate simulation of intermittent processes with zero inflated non gaussian marginal distributions for instance it could represent fine time rainfall processes at two locations on the other hand cases b and c can arise in practice when aiming to model counting e g number of drought events in a given year or occurrence e g sequences of wet and dry transitions processes respectively regarding cmarta p implementation and evaluation for case studies a c let us focus on the first case since the simulation procedure as well as the results are similar for all three cases given that the target distributions red line in fig 1c d auto correlation structure red line in fig 1h i and lag 0 cross correlation red line for τ 0 in fig 1j are already known we begin by estimating the required f relationships fig 1e g these are subsequently inverted to estimate the corresponding equivalent correlation coefficients and the parameters of the auxiliary gp model i e cmar p next a bivariate realization of the gp process i e z t z t 1 z t 2 t with the desired length in this case 100 000 is generated the final step involves the mapping of the gaussian process to attain a realization of the target one i e x t x t 1 x t 2 t using the corresponding icdf i e x t i f x i 1 φ z t i the validity of the model is verified by the plots of fig 1 case a fig c 1 case b and fig c 2 case c which illustrate that cmarta is able to accurately reproduce the probabilistic and stochastic structure of the target processes regardless if the marginal distributions are zero inflated or discrete 3 addressing multi scale consistency the above simulation framework although fulfilling the requirements of a good stochastic model i e the explicit reproduction of any distribution and any correlation structure it does not account for multi scale consistency since the problem is independent of the generation procedure and the time scale of simulation we first provide a global overview and then propose a generic solution for nataf based models herein referred to as nataf based disaggregation to anything nda 3 1 problem description let us begin from the univariate case denoting by ω n n z a discrete time stationary or cyclostationary the season indicator s is omitted for simplicity stochastic process at time scale k 1 where n is a time index let also define the aggregated process ω l k at a higher time scale k z 2 obtained by 9 ω l k n l 1 k 1 kl ω n where l is the time index of the aggregated process alternatively e g if ω n refers to an instantaneous quantity we can define the averaged process also denoted by ω l k by ω l k n l 1 k 1 kl ω n k apparently the properties of ω n at scale k 1 are related with those of the aggregated or averaged process at a higher time scale k z 2 herein without loss of generality we focus on the aggregated case to simplify we first remark that the operations implied by eq 9 can be viewed as a sum of k rvs thus if we were interested in the distribution of ω l k it would be the same as solving an aggregated distribution problem if the process ω n is stationary at k 1 then at any higher scale k we would have the sum of k identical rvs on the other hand if ω n is cyclostationary at the lower scale k 1 at any higher scale k we would have the sum of k non identical rvs their marginal and dependence properties depend on the season s 1 s implied by the time index n see section 2 1 arguably the problem of identifying the distribution of ω l k at k 1 is particularly challenging since there is no general method without resorting to simulation to identify the distribution of the sum of k rvs especially in the presence of dependence which is typical for hydrometeorological processes furthermore apart from some low order moments i e mean variance autocovariance and autocorrelation higher order moments of the aggregated process are also particularly difficult to estimate either analytically or theoretically analogously it is also challenging to specify a process ω n that has the desirable for this time scale marginal and stochastic properties when it is aggregated at a higher scale k 1 the problem becomes even harder when multiple processes are involved in the context of multivariate simulation problems let ξ t ξ t 1 ξ t m t and ω n ω n 1 ω n m t be two m dimensional vectors of two discrete time processes ξ t i and ω n i indexed using t z and n z respectively furthermore let assume that ξ t i and ω n i represent the same process at two different temporal scales higher and lower respectively with time units denoted by δ ξ and δ ω respectively i e δ ξ δ ω similarly to eq 9 when k k δ ξ δ ω e g 1 year 1 month 12 or 1 month 1 hour 28 24 30 24 31 24 depending on the number of days of the month we obtain an aggregated process at the same temporal level of ξ t i i e 10 ξ t i ω l i k n l 1 k 1 l k ω n i l t evidently when ω n i is simulated without reference to the higher level process ξ t i then ξ t i ξ t i hence for each process i 1 m our target is to generate a k dimensional random sequence ω t k i ω t 1 k 1 i ω t k i of the low level process k 1 with the desirable properties which honors the equality ξ t i ξ t i when aggregated to the time scale k the multivariate formulation of the problem is written as ω t k ω t k 1 t ω t k m t t ω t 1 k 1 1 ω t k 1 ω t 1 k 1 m ω t k m a n d 11 ξ t ξ t 1 ξ t m t n t 1 k 1 t k ω n 1 n t 1 k 1 t k ω n m t 3 2 the nda approach step by step implementation in order to address the problem we develop the nataf based disaggregation to anything nda approach which combines nataf based models considered as data generation mechanisms with a coupling procedure that encompasses the notions of repetitive sampling and adjusting procedures these two key notions are thoroughly discussed by koutsoyiannis and manetas 1996 the nda procedure starts from a given realization ξ t of a process ξ t at a specific time scale aiming to produce a consistent realization ω n at a lower scale the given realization ξ t is known either from observations or already generated by another model deterministic or stochastic in the second case if a nataf based model is employed the synthesized higher level realization would have the desirable marginal distributions and correlation structure hence the problem would reduce to generating a lower level realization with the target properties which when aggregated to the higher level honors the additive property fulfilling both conditions allows preserving the properties of the process at both temporal levels given that the realization at the higher level is kept as is therefore given the realization ξ t and assuming a temporary nataf based lower level process denoted by ω n with properties identical to those of the target process ω n i e ω n ω n the following steps are applied for all time indices t 1 using a nataf based model cf table 1 generate n ξ ω temporary realizations ω n of the lower level process ω n of length k thus obtaining n ξ ω sets of matrices ω t k ν ν 1 n ξ ω 2 for each of the n ξ ω matrices ω t k estimate the corresponding vector ξ t and obtain a set of vectors ξ t ν ν 1 n ξ ω 3 calculate the difference between ξ t v and the known ξ t using a distance metric e t ν d ξ t ν ξ t 4 formulate the set e t ν ν 1 n ξ ω and select the realization ω t k v with the minimum value of e t ν hereafter denoted ω t k the breve notation has been omitted for simplicity under this premise by aggregating ω t k to time scale k thus obtaining the corresponding sum ξ t its difference with the target values of ξ t will be the minimum over the simulated set 5 produce the final values of ω t k by adjusting the remaining difference between ξ t and ξ t by employing a specific adjusting procedure we remark that since we employ nataf based models in order to ensure a proper sequential generation procedure it is essential to maintain an archive of the realizations generated by the auxiliary gp model these are needed to condition the generation mechanism on the required number of previous values for instance if we employ cmarta p for generating the temporary realizations ω n p previous values of the auxiliary gaussian realization are needed to condition the generation of ω n 1 3 3 computational details for convenience within repetitive sampling step 3 we employ as a distance metric the following quantity also used by koutsoyiannis and manetas 1996 12 e t d ξ t ξ t 1 m i 1 m ξ t i ξ t i var ξ t i on the other hand all available adjusting procedures aps that are found in the literature see grygier stedinger 1988 harms campbell 1967 koutsoyiannis 2001 are compatible with the proposed approach here we employ the so called proportional ap that can be implemented independently for each ω t k i and reads as 13 ω t k i ω t k i ξ t i ξ t i apart from its simplicity key advantage of this ap is the preservation of the sign of each realization ω t k i for instance in case of rainfall where the underlying nataf based model is combined with a mixed type distribution to represent intermittency see section 2 5 the proportional adjustment not only prohibits the generation of negative rainfall values but also preserves the sequence of zero and non zero values as explicitly foreseen by the auxiliary nataf model a final technical issue involves the termination criteria for repetitive sampling here we consider that the iterative procedure terminates when reaching a maximum number of allowable iterations n ξ ω an alternative option would imply the use of a convergence criterion by means of a similarity metric between ξ t and ξ t nevertheless the stopping criteria should be carefully assigned since they control both the accuracy and computational efficiency of nda which are inherently conflicting in our examples we set n ξ ω 250 to 350 which was heuristically identified as a fair conciliation for multivariate problems involving up to five processes we remark that for the univariate case per se papalexiou et al 2018 addressed the challenge of a priori determining the required number of iterations within disaggregation through bernoulli trials we remark that in contrast to other disaggregation schemes where repetitive sampling had an optional role cf koutsoyiannis manetas 1996 in our approach its role is pivotal since it allows the preservation of the advantages of nataf based models and hence generate lower level realizations with the target probabilistic and stochastic properties 4 modular framework for developing multi temporal simulation schemes 4 1 multi temporal stochastic simulation as a puzzle game as already discussed there does not exist a general bottom up solution to the problem of multi scale consistency by means of a generation procedure that provides consistent synthetic data at a time scale of interest and simultaneously captures the scale varying stochastic probabilistic behavior of the aggregated process at higher time scales in a practical context the generally accepted requirement for a good stochastic model is to reproduce the desirable probabilistic and dependence properties across specific temporal scales that have operational interest typically these follow the standard resolutions of hydrometeorological time series i e annual monthly daily hourly etc in this context we propose a puzzle type implementation of nda to address multi scale simulation problems of any complexity essentially this can be done by coupling in a pairwise manner multiple nataf based models which operate independently of each other thereby one can establish a modular top down approach starting from the first level which corresponds to the highest time scale of interest and subsequently moving to next levels until reaching the lowest scale which is dictated by the simulation problem at hand as shown in fig 2 each individual coupling of subsequent scales through nda can be considered as the pieces of a puzzle the generic design of nda ensures flexibility regarding the combination of temporal scales while at the same time the robustness of the underlying nataf based approach ensures the preservation of the desirable process properties for demonstration we next present a typical configuration of this puzzle by means of a three level scheme for annual to daily simulation which is of significant interest for a wide range of operational hydrological problems in section 5 we explore the capacities of this configuration in the context of a real world case study involving the generation of synthetic daily rainfall and runoff series moreover in section 6 we present another useful configuration this time for handling a classical disaggregation problem i e the generation of hourly rainfall from a given daily time series 4 2 three level configuration for annual to daily simulation in this configuration we couple three nataf based models shown in table 1 to provide a multivariate three level simulation scheme this modular scheme i e puzzle aims to preserve the probabilistic and dependence properties of typical hydrometeorological processes at the annual monthly and daily scales let y t y t 1 y t m t be a vector of m stationary stochastic process at the annual time scale where t t y denotes the time index i e year over the set t y in the context of this configuration we model the annual processes using smarta in order to preserve the distribution function of y t i i e f y i y its autocorrelation structure ρ y τ i c o r r y t i y t τ i the lag 0 cross correlations among processes y t i and y t j i e ρ y i j c o r r y t i y t j on the other hand the standard hypothesis for the monthly time scale is cyclostationarity let the monthly process be represented by an m dimensional vector x s n x s n 1 x s n m t where s 1 12 1 12 denotes the month and n t x is the time index the index t of the annual process i e the year may be recovered by t 1 n s 12 for monthly simulation we employ sparta in order to resemble the seasonally varying marginal distribution of x s n i i e f x s x f x s 12 x the lag 1 month to month correlation coefficients ρ x s s 1 i c o r r x s i x s 1 i the lag 0 cross correlations among processes x s i and x s j for each season s i e ρ x s i j c o r r x s i x s j finally the hydrometeorological processes at sub monthly time scales e g daily are typically regarded to be stationary within in each month s in this respect let w s d w s d 1 w s d m t be an m dimensional vector of stationary processes at month s where d t w s denotes the time index we remark that in this case k δ x s δ w s where δ x s and δ w s denote the time units of x s n i and w s d i respectively for instance if w s d i represents the process of month s at the daily temporal level k d s where d s stands for the days of a month s i e 28 30 or 31 excluding leap years similarly if w s d i denotes an hourly process then k d s 24 nonetheless for the simulation of daily temporal level we employ cmarta model and aim to reproduce the seasonally varying marginal distribution of w s n i i e f w s w f w s n w the within month autocorrelation structure ρ w s τ i c o r r w s d i w s d τ i the lag 0 cross correlation coefficients among processes w s i and w s j for each season s i e ρ w s i j c o r r w s i w s j provided that the parameters of the individual models have been identified see section 2 8 for a general overview as well as appendix d for a model specific description the simulation procedure starts with generating a realization of the annual processes using the smarta model and subsequently moves to the monthly and daily level through the nda approach the overall procedure is organized as follows 4 2 1 generation of annual synthetic time series using smarta synthesize an m dimensional realization of the annual process y t with t 1 t where t denotes the desirable simulation length the synthesized realization is represented by a m t matrix y i e y y 1 1 y t 1 y 1 m y t m 4 2 2 generation and adjustment of monthly synthetic time series by construction the realization y t fulfils the specifications of the annual level hence the next step is to generate t realizations of the monthly multivariate process x s n each of length 12 i e equal to the number of months these realizations have to reproduce the specifications implied for the monthly time scale and additionally when aggregated to the annual temporal level to honor the additive property i e y t i n t 1 12 1 12 t x s n i therefore for each year t 1 t we employ nda with the sparta model as the generation mechanism by setting ξ t y t and ω n x s n and obtain t matrices x 1 x t x t which contain the final adjusted monthly realizations each matrix has the form x t x 1 t 1 12 1 1 x 12 t 12 1 x 1 t 1 12 1 m x 12 t 12 m finally the matrices are concatenated in x x 1 x t x t 4 2 3 generation and adjustment of daily synthetic time series for the disaggregation of monthly generated values to the daily temporal level and given the previous matrix organization it is convenient to refer to the obtained adjusted monthly realization with reference to season s and year t not time index n i e x s t where s 1 12 and t 1 t for instance in this notation x 3 2 refers to the third month of the second year at this point we have at our disposal a realization at the monthly level of length 12 t and seek to generate an equal number of realizations of the daily time scale each one with length d s i e 30 31 or 28 similarly to the previous level and for the same reasons we want the realizations of w s d to resemble the specifications of the sub monthly time scale and fulfil the additive property i e x s t i d t 1 d s 1 d s t w s d i in this vein for each month s 1 12 and year t 1 t employ nda using cmarta for data generation by setting ξ t x s t and ω n w s d and obtain 12 t matrices w s t which contain the final adjusted daily realizations i e w s t w s t 1 d s 1 1 w s t d s 1 w s t 1 d s 1 m w s t d s m finally the matrices are concatenated in w w 1 1 w 12 1 w 1 t w 12 t which contains the complete sequence of the daily realization 5 case study a multi temporal simulation of daily rainfall and runoff processes to assess the performance of the aforementioned three level configuration scheme we selected a case study that regards the contemporaneous synthesis of daily rainfall and runoff data at the river basin of achelous western greece upstream of kremasta dam draining an area of 3570 km2 fig 3 a and b the evaluation of the model is performed at all time scales of interest daily monthly annual by comparing the empirical simulated and theoretical i e target marginal and stochastic characteristics of both the daily and aggregated data the time horizon of simulation is 2000 years i e 730000 days fig 3c and d regarding the model parameterization we employed a theoretical autocorrelation model i e cauchy type cas eq 8 for describing the auto dependence structure of the processes at the annual and daily time scales it is noted that at the daily scale the parameters of cas were varied on a monthly basis furthermore the target distribution functions were varied according to the time scale of simulation the season and the type of processes i e runoff or rainfall in all cases the parameters of the distribution functions have been identified on the basis of historical data using the l moments method particularly in the case of runoff we modeled the data using either the three parameter log normal l n eq a 2 the generalized gamma g g eq a 3 or the burr type xii b r x i i eq a 4 distribution on the hand for the daily rainfall process which is characterized by intermittent behavior we employed the zero inflated distribution model of eq 6 using for the continuous component one of the aforementioned distributions starting from the annual temporal level fig 4 summarizes the ability of the highest level model to preserve both the target distribution function and the autocorrelation structure of each process furthermore the model resembled the lag 0 cross correlation among the two processes with high accuracy the historical and simulated values are 0 813 and 0 815 respectively the high values are physically explained by the significantly rich hydrological conditions of the basins it is noted that the parameters of cas have been manually fine tuned in order to increase the degree of annual long range dependence and stress test the capabilities of the associated simulation scheme figs 5 and 6 a provides a quick outlook of the results obtained at the monthly time scale preserving with high accuracy the empirical l moments the seasonality expressed by means of month to month correlation coefficients as well as the lag 0 cross correlations beyond summary statistics a more challenging test is the reproduction of the monthly target marginal distributions figs 7 and 8 compare the empirical distribution of the historical and synthetic data with the target theoretical model the fitted distribution as well as its parameters are shown in the title of each sub plot in all cases the model resembled the target distribution with notable accuracy the previous figures illustrate the ability of the integrated model to generate cyclostationary realizations that are also consistent with the specifications of the annual temporal level as an additional diagnostic and to test the model for envelope behavior we employed scatter plots and depicted the established dependence patterns an example is given in fig 9 which depicts the lag 1 month to month dependence patterns of runoff series the scheme does not exhibit the aforementioned behavior yet more interestingly it was found capable of creating a variety of dependence forms which are also in accordance with the historical ones the results obtained for other time scales or rainfall are similar hence not shown herein regarding the lowest level of simulation that is the daily time scale the comparison among summary statistics of figs 10 and 6b depicting the lag 0 cross correlations at daily scale as well as the empirical simulated and theoretical distribution functions depicted in figs 11 and 12 underline the ability of the model to generate consistent realizations with the higher levels and also preserve the target distribution functions of the daily process which at this time scale are characterized by considerably heavier tails notice that for daily runoff and for the months february to may we selected the b r x i i model which is a heavy tailed distribution with power type tail recall that the r th moment of the b r x i i exist only if a 1 a 2 r remarkably nda accurately simulated even february s daily runoff which is characterized by a 1 a 2 2 90 implying that it only has finite mean and variance furthermore to this figs 13 and 14 depict a monthly based comparison of the empirical simulated and theoretical autocorrelation function acf of the daily process which in most cases deviates from the typical ar 1 acf that most daily stochastic models are capable of simulating inspection of this figure reveals that the integrated model can resemble the theoretical auto dependence structure with high precision this result stems from the combination within nda of two modelling components the cmarta and the use of theoretical auto dependence structure e g cas an additional assessment of model s performance concerns its capabilities regarding the reproduction of statistical characteristics that are not explicitly modelled by the method these may involve marginal properties at intermediate temporal scales as well as a plethora of other features such as transition probabilities dry wet spells and asymptotic properties associated with the reproduction of extremes in this context in order to evaluate the model s behavior at the intermediate time scales between daily and monthly we aggregated the historical and synthetic daily series at several scales k 2 d s and compared on a monthly basis the l mean l 1 k l scale l 2 k l skewness l cs k coefficients and the probability dry p d k at each scale k this analysis is presented in the supplementary material figs s1 s8 as shown although the intermediate time scales i e k 1 d s are not explicitly modelled neither by the three level scheme or nda the arguably good agreement with historical data can be attributed to the accurate simulation of the process at daily and monthly time scales in the supplementary material we further explore the intermittency related features of daily rainfall by comparing the dry and wet spell distributions fig s9 as well as the transition probabilities between dry dry and wet wet sequences fig s10 in this case also the synthetic data exhibit a satisfactory agreement with the historical ones which is mainly attributed to the reproduction of the auto dependencies in combination with the flexibility provided by the mixed type distributions however in our view an even more important evidence of the model s success involves the reproduction of the extremes in this vein fig 15 depicts the empirical and simulated daily annual maxima as well as the fitted using the l moments method to the historical data generalized extreme value g e v distribution i e eq a 7 as shown in both cases the model manages to resemble the distributional form of the identified g e v distribution characterized by an arguably heavy tailed behavior which is expressed through the fréchet distribution since a 0 reasonably this behavior is attributed to the concise reproduction of the distributions at the daily time scale which was modelled using either the power type b r x i i or the l n distribution we recall that at each month we applied different distribution models based on empirical criteria and hydrological evidence 6 case study b disaggregation of daily rainfall to hourly scale to demonstrate the flexibility provided by nda as well the potential to extend the three level scheme of section 4 for even lower temporal levels we now provide a two level configuration for disaggregating a univariate daily sequence to the hourly scale this scheme is applied to an hourly rainfall dataset at oberstdorf germany provided from the german weather service deutscher wetterdienst station id 3730 the historical data extend over the period 01 09 1995 to 31 12 2017 fig 16 in this example we do not aim to generate synthetic data that represents the actual process across multiple time scales of interest such as in case study a in contrast our goal is to provide a synthetic hourly realization under the following requirements the synthetic data at the hourly scale reproduces the probabilistic and stochastic properties of the historical sample the additive property is preserved between the aggregated hourly k 1 synthetic data and the corresponding historical ones k 24 by definition in disaggregation problems the synthetic sequence has the same length as the given data to cope with the effect of seasonality we employ the typical assumption for fine time scale rainfall processes e g daily hourly or finer that of cyclical stationarity with annual period and monthly sub period see also section 4 assuming that the sequence w s d denotes the observed daily records for month s we simulate an hourly process e g η s h h z which is also considered stationary within month s this implies that the distribution function f η s of the process as well as its auto correlation structure i e ρ η s τ c o r r η s h η s h τ remain invariant within the month s furthermore to account for temporal consistency we impose the requirement of generating realizations of the process η s h constrained by w s d w s d where w s d η s l 24 h l 1 24 1 l 24 η s h analogous to eq 10 in order to simulate the hourly rainfall we employ as generation mechanism the univariate version of cmarta which is known as arta cario nelson 1996 we recall that this model uses as an auxiliary gp a gaussian ar process see appendix b 1 the generation scheme is employed on a monthly basis since the hourly process properties are reasonably considered seasonally varying regarding the parameterization of arta the marginal distribution of hourly rainfall of each month is modelled using the zero inflated model of eq 6 in this case for the continuous part we fitted using l moments the g g distribution i e eq a 3 the parameters of the model are shown in fig 16d f for the autocorrelation structure of the hourly rainfall we fitted monthly varying cas models eq 8 to the corresponding empirical autocorrelation coefficients red line in fig 16g i eventually each individual hourly process is modeled using five parameters three for the marginal distribution and two for the autocorrelation structure in fig 16c are shown the synthetic i e disaggregated to hourly scale rainfall data in fig 16d e and g i we show for three representative months february june october that the model resembles with good accuracy the target distributions and autocorrelation structures respectively similarly good performance is achieved for the rest of the months see supplementary material figs s11 and s12 furthermore in order to investigate the behavior of the model at the intermediate time scales 1 k 24 in fig 17 we depict for three characteristics months february june and october both the historical and synthetic series the l mean l 1 k l scale l 2 k l skewness l cs k probability dry p d k and lag 1 autocorrelation coefficient ρ 1 k as a function of the aggregation level k the rest of the months are shown in figs s13 s17 of supplementary material inspection of these plots reveals the potential of the nda approach to preserve the empirical scaling properties of rainfall without requiring the use of cascading of techniques and direct simulation of rainfall at intermediate temporal levels 7 conclusions in order to address the puzzle of multi temporal simulation of hydrometeorological processes we developed a puzzle type approach employing chain implementation of a novel generation procedure called nataf based disaggregation to anything nda this is built upon recent advances in stochastics by means of nataf based models coupled with the concepts of repetitive sampling and adjusting this coupling allows taking advantage of the primary ability of nataf based models to represent stationary processes that exhibit any distribution and any correlation structure the recent extension of nataf based models to simulate cyclostationary as well as multivariate processes offered the essential generality to handle challenging single scale hydrometeorological simulation problems however as widely discussed the reproduction of a target s probabilistic and stochastic behavior at a single temporal scale does not guarantee similarly consistent performance at higher temporal scales in this work the issue of consistency across any pair of scales is handled via the nda approach while the general puzzle type framework enables the transition to multi scale simulations we recall that nda uses nataf based models at two independent scales as underlying data generators and coupling mechanisms to adjust the lower level data to the higher one the above approach ensures significant flexibility since it allows establishing any configuration of scale consistent simulators through pairwise link of ndas this flexibility and the advantages of nda itself have been mainly revealed by configuring a multivariate simulation scheme that reproduces the probabilistic and stochastic properties of the processes of interest at three characteristic temporal scales i e annual monthly and daily in this configuration we integrated different nataf based models for each scale i e smarta for the annual sparta for the monthly and cmarta and incidental contribution of this work for the daily one the multi temporal simulation capabilities of the integrated scheme were evaluated on the basis of a long term bi variate simulation study aiming at the generation of synthetic rainfall and runoff data as shown the model reproduced with accuracy the characteristics of the underlying hydrometeorological processes which exhibit substantial differences among the two processes and across scales and seasons key requirements in this study were the reproduction of a wide range of target distribution functions varying across processes scales and seasons the simultaneous simulation of intermittent and continuous processes i e daily rainfall and runoff exhibiting significant correlations the preservation of target short term and long term auto dependence structures at the annual scale as well as the daily scale on seasonal basis the preservation of target season to season correlations at the monthly scale the preservation of target lag 0 cross correlations at all scales one can observe that in the above bucket list we make repeated use of term target in order to highlight the multidimensional role of the user actually before employing simulations there are several critical modelling decisions to make regarding the assignment of suitable distribution functions and correlation structures to the processes of interest this also involves the selection of time scales to represent thus the configuration of the puzzle this flexibility may offer significant advantages for instance in this specific study the careful selection of the daily distribution models resulted in reproducing the heavy tailed behavior of the observed daily extremes we recall that the reproduction of extremes was not set as an explicit requirement of the model thus making this surprising outcome a promising topic for further research the model performance at even finer temporal scales i e hourly was demonstrated through a disaggregation example where we employed nda for the synthesis of hourly rainfall realizations that are consistent with the observed daily data similarly to the first study the model faithfully reproduced the target behavior of the hourly process simultaneously ensuring consistency with the daily scale moreover it reproduced with accuracy important statistical properties of rainfall expressed in terms of l moments at intermediate scales above all this study highlighted the scale free character of nda as well as its ability to handle hydrological disaggregation problems arguably the potential applications of our puzzle type approach extend beyond the realm of hydrometeorological time series generation or disaggregation essentially it is a general purpose stochastic simulation scheme depending on the synthesis of the puzzle pieces i e chain of ndas as well as the underlying decisions of each nda in terms of target marginal distributions and correlation structures it is possible to apply the method for the simulation of a widely extended range of processes geophysical and socioeconomic beyond simulation other applications of nda may concern downscaling or disaggregation problems which require a replacing the corresponding higher level simulation model with the realizations provided by global or regional climate models and b identifying the marginal and stochastic properties of the lower level model using e g in situ gauging stations regional information and or scaling laws eventually the proposed approach can be employed within broader monte carlo experiments to provide long synthetic input data to deterministic simulation models given that the type and number of processes to simulate as well as their temporal resolution is dictated by the deterministic model a major computational challenge arises in particular the repetitive sampling within nda imposes a bottleneck when applied to high dimensional multivariate problems and or long term simulations at fine time scales potential remediation to this technical problem may be the use of parallel computing or the model implementation in low level programming languages regarding the modelling framework per se potential future research may focus on two interesting aspects that have been revealed in the two case studies the first involves the reproduction of non explicitly preserved statistical features with emphasis to extremes while the second is the validation of the model behavior at intermediate time scales another interesting research target is the comparison with alternative synthetic generation schemes to assess the practical impacts of stochastic model selection in problems that typically rely on synthetic inputs such as water resources planning and management hydrological simulations and flood risk assessment since each problem is influenced by different statistical aspects of the input processes the generality and flexibility of the proposed

6351,the generation of hydrometeorological time series that exhibit a given probabilistic and stochastic behavior across multiple temporal levels traditionally expressed in terms of specific statistical characteristics of the observed data is a crucial task for risk based water resources studies and simultaneously a puzzle for the community of stochastics the main challenge stems from the fact that the reproduction of a specific behavior at a certain temporal level does not imply the reproduction of the desirable behavior at any other level of aggregation in this respect we first introduce a pairwise coupling of nataf based stochastic models within a disaggregation scheme and next we propose their puzzle type configuration to provide a generic stochastic simulation framework for multivariate processes exhibiting any distribution and any correlation structure within case studies we demonstrate two characteristic configurations i e a three level one operating at daily monthly and annual basis and a two level one to disaggregate daily to hourly data the first configuration is applied to generate correlated daily rainfall and runoff data at the river basin of achelous western greece which preserves the stochastic behavior of the two processes at the three temporal levels the second configuration disaggregates daily rainfall obtained from a meteorological station at germany to hourly the two studies reveal the ability of the proposed framework to represent the peculiar behavior of hydrometeorological processes at multiple temporal resolutions as well as its flexibility on formulating generic simulation schemes keywords stochastic processes nataf based models non gaussian distributions correlation structures multivariate simulation disaggregation 1 introduction today most water recourse studies employ monte carlo simulations by running deterministic models that are driven by synthetic inputs which are typically generated by stochastic models in this context the key requirement for extracting statistically consistent outcomes is the concise representation of the probabilistic behavior and stochastic structure of the input hydrometeorological processes e g rainfall runoff temperature it is well known that these exhibit a significantly complex regime the most prominent aspects of which are non gaussianity intermittency auto and cross dependence as well as periodicity koutsoyiannis 2005 moran 1970 salas et al 1980 all the above peculiarities dictate the specifications of a good simulation model actually the first two characteristics non gaussianity and intermittency are directly associated with the marginal properties of the process and imply the need for a suitable probability distribution model on the other hand auto and cross dependencies are associated with the stochastic joint properties of the process both in time and space and point out the need for stochastic simulation models per se in fact if the physical processes to simulate were not auto or cross correlated the problem would be substantially simpler as the production of synthetic data would be trivially made by generating uniform numbers and then employing probability integral transformations finally periodicity introduces further complexity since it implies representing the processes as cyclostationary thus differentiating their marginal and joint properties not only across different temporal scales but also across seasons or systematically repeated time intervals in general during more than a half century the need for good synthetic data generators to be used within risk aware decision making frameworks for design assessment and operation of water resource systems celeste billib 2009 feng et al 2017 giuliani et al 2014 haberlandt et al 2011 koutsoyiannis economou 2003 paschalis et al 2014 tsoukalas et al 2016 tsoukalas makropoulos 2015a b has triggered numerous researchers for developing a plethora of stochastic approaches and associated modelling tools these can be primarily classified into two broad categories i e single scale and multi scale the former ensure the reproduction of a set of statistical and stochastic properties at a unique time scale of interest i e the time interval of simulation while the latter attempt to simultaneously represent the desirable properties of the simulated data as well as the properties of the aggregated data at coarser temporal scales the numerous single scale simulation schemes that have been developed so far can be further classified into 1 linear stochastic models also known as time series generators e g bras rodríguez iturbe 1985 koutsoyiannis 1999 2000 matalas wallis 1976 matalas 1967 salas et al 1980 thomas fiering 1962 2 point process models bo et al

models attempt to reproduce the desirable statistical and stochastic behavior within the synthetic data at the scale of simulation yet they provide limited control to the properties of the same process when aggregated at higher coarser time scales it is well known that the reproduction of the probabilistic and stochastic behavior of a process expressed either in terms of a distribution function or a set of statistical properties at a certain time scale does not ensure the reproduction of the associated characteristics of the aggregated process at any other time scale the necessity for multi scale consistency has been early recognized by the hydrological community through the pioneering work by harms and campbell 1967 actually from the first steps of monte carlo approaches in water resources it has been accepted that that the outcomes of stochastic analyses are associated with the overall statistical and stochastic behavior of the input hydrometeorological processes which may extend far beyond the time interval of the underlying deterministic simulation model see klemeš 1981 koutsoyiannis 2005 for instance the design and operation of large reservoir systems that employ overyear regulation which are typically modelled in monthly intervals is strongly dictated by the probabilistic and stochastic properties of the aggregated inflows at the annual and even over annual scales similarly the outputs of continuous flood simulation models driven by fine time e g hourly rainfall series are substantially affected by the sequence of accumulated rainfall as the runoff production strongly depends on the antecedent soil moisture conditions in this respect multi scale consistency in stochastic simulation can be regarded as an operational sine qua non furthermore multi scale consistency is directly linked with the so called issue of low frequency variability or over dispersion i e the deficiency to reproduce the process variance at higher time scales which is encountered in many popular daily weather generation models e g baigorria jones 2010 breinl et al 2013 2015 brissette et al 2007 katz parlange 1998 khalili et al 2009 lee 2017 mehrotra et al 2006 mhanna bauwens 2012 serinaldi 2009 srikanthan pegram 2009 wilks 1998 wilks wilby 1999 multi scale simulation schemes with the exception of few specifically designed models e g langousis koutsoyiannis 2006 rodriguez iturbe et al 1987 is typically built upon the disaggregation paradigm the essential element of disaggregation is the additive property which enables the generation of multi scale consistent time series via the transfer of information among different temporal scales this implies that the sum of the generated variables at the lower level e g monthly at any period should add to the corresponding value at the higher level e g annual which is assumed known either from observed or synthetic simulated data this property distinguishes disaggregation from downscaling e g cannon 2008 lombardo et al 2012 wilks wilby 1999 which focus on generating lower level time series that statistically resemble the properties of higher level ones and not necessarily honor the additive constraint as already mentioned the beginning of the quest at least in hydrological domain for multi scale simulation models can be attributed to harms and campbell 1967 who developed a two level version of the classical stochastic model by thomas and fiering 1962 that preserves some key statistical properties of the observed data at both the annual and monthly scale a little later the interest on such methods reinforced with the theoretical research on disaggregation by valencia and schakke 1973 and mejia and rousselle 1976 however the proposed methods were fully general only for normally distributed variables thus limiting their applicability to a relatively narrow range of processes and scales the next generation approaches offered multi scale schemes that utilized the notion of the so called adjusting procedures grygier stedinger 1988 harms campbell 1967 koutsoyiannis 2001 koutsoyiannis manetas 1996 stedinger vogel 1984 these aimed at coupling single scale simulation models of any type operating independently at different time scales the rationale is generating low level synthetic data as auxiliary information and next adjusting them to the known higher level values by using relatively simple algebraic transformations such as the partial sums at the low level equal the values of the higher level koutsoyiannis and manetas 1996 and koutsoyiannis 2001 investigated several adjusting procedures and also standardized the concept of repetitive sampling kind of monte carlo approach to ensure that the partial sums are close to the given values this can be regarded as an informal method of conditional sampling that can significantly improve the efficiency of such schemes for an early formulation of this idea see glasbey et al 1995 adjusting procedures of varying complexity have been implemented within a number of disaggregation based schemes in order to couple single scale simulation models such as the ones described above across various time scales in particular they were used within linear stochastic models e g allard bourotte 2015 efstratiadis et al 2014 koutsoyiannis et al 2003 lombardo et al 2012 segond et al 2006 tsoukalas et al

baldassarre 2019 lee et al 2010 li et al 2018 and copula based models e g gyasi agyei 2011 gyasi agyei melching 2012 it is highlighted that the overall simulation capabilities of adjusting based schemes are determined by the underlying simulation models which consist the core data generation mechanism in addition several modern schemes for establishing multi scale consistency are built upon the concepts of scaling and multifractality kantelhardt et al 2006 tessier et al 1996 veneziano et al 2006 typically these employ multiplicative random cascade models gupta waymire 1990 1993 to generate multi scale consistent in terms of typically high order moments realizations deidda et al 1999 menabde et al 1997 molnar burlando 2005 müller haberlandt 2015 2018 olsson 1998 rupp et al 2009 recent works by lombardo et al 2012 and pui et al 2012 provide comparative studies involving such models as well as alternative downscaling or disaggregation methods besides the vast effort made so far the quest for full generality and full consistency across multiple scales herein the focus is on temporal scales but may also concern spatial ones still remains a puzzle recently tsoukalas et al 2018a highlighted that many of widespread schemes including linear stochastic models with non gaussian innovations point process models and resampling techniques emphasize the reproduction of a specific set of summary statistical characteristics which arguably cannot capture the full behavior of a random process as also shown under some common conditions these may lead to bounded dependence patterns which are not realistic tsoukalas et al 2018d on the other hand two part and copula based models are actually able to explicitly account for the distributional properties of simulated processes yet they are mainly designed to represent specific correlation structures for instance two part models often neglect temporal dependencies while copula based schemes typically account for temporal dependencies spanning over only few time lags in this work our focus is not on disaggregation per se rather than we employ the flexibility provided by the concepts of repetitive sampling and adjusting procedures to link individual multivariate or univariate stochastic models in order to represent the varying regime of hydrometeorological processes across multiple temporal scales our emphasis is to shift from the classical paradigm of describing a process in terms of few summary statistics in particular moments up to third order and low order correlation coefficients to the explicit representation of its marginal and stochastic properties in terms of distribution functions and theoretical correlation structures respectively this is accomplished by building upon a recently introduced in hydrology class of stochastic models the so called nataf based models named after the contribution of nataf 1962 and the further developments by tsoukalas et al 2017 2018a c as well as by papalexiou 2018 these are able to simulate multivariate stationary and cyclostationary processes with any marginal distributions and any correlation structures these properties allow for characterizing nataf based models as good single scale stochastic simulators and thus appropriate data generators within multi scale adjusting based schemes taking advantage of the above concepts we propose a scale free disaggregation approach for the pairwise coupling of nataf based models aiming to preserve the desirable marginal distributions and correlation structures the proposed approach is next referred to as nataf based disaggregation to anything nda eventually a chain configuration of nda allows for developing puzzle type i e modular simulation schemes that ensure consistent simulations across any sequence of temporal scales a sequence may involve any combination of stochastic models stationary or cyclostationary this paper is organized as follows section 2 discusses the core generation procedure through nataf based stochastic models section 3 describes the disaggregation based coupling approach i e nda designed to maintain consistency across pairwise scales and section 4 presents the puzzle type multi level simulation scheme next two sections demonstrate two characteristic configurations of this puzzle particularly section 5 presents a three level multivariate scheme applied for generating synthetic rainfall and runoff data at the river basin of achelous greece on the other hand the configuration of section 6 aims at synthesizing hourly rainfall data from a given i e observed daily record thus illustrating the efficiency of the method against challenging disaggregation problems finally section 7 summarizes the overall modelling framework and discusses its potential applications and future improvements 2 nataf based stochastic models in a recent work tsoukalas et al 2018a highlighted the need for generalized generation schemes which are able to represent processes from any distribution and any correlation structure this has been also regarded as a shift in classical stochastic modelling emphasizing on the reproduction of a finite set of essential statistical characteristics cf matalas wallis 1976 estimated from the historical data an effective and efficient handling of this requirement is offered by the so called nataf based models tsoukalas 2019 tsoukalas et al 2017 2018a 2018c that use the notion of parent gaussian processes papalexiou 2018 as the name suggests these are built upon a quite old idea by nataf 1962 who proposed the non linear mapping of an auxiliary multivariate gaussian distribution in order to construct the joint distribution of random variables with arbitrary marginal distributions whose variance exists an assumption implied throughout this paper using a similar rationale it is possible to establish stochastic processes with any target marginal distribution and correlation structure expressed in terms of pearson s correlation coefficient through the mapping of an appropriately specified auxiliary stationary or cyclostationary gaussian process gp with zero mean and unit variance to which an equivalent correlation structure is assigned see details below the mapping operation is typically a non linear function often implemented through the inverse cumulative distribution function icdf these approaches can be viewed as gaussian copula based schemes since they rely on the mapping of a gaussian process or non linear versions of the classic i e gaussian linear stochastic schemes tsoukalas et al 2018c nataf based models have been widely employed within the domain of operations research e g biller nelson 2003 cario nelson 1996 and probabilistic engineering mechanics e g deodatis micaletti 2001 grigoriu 1998 while their application in hydrological modelling was until recently unknown beyond the aforementioned works see the work of kossieris et al 2019 who for the first time employed such models for the simulation of water demand processes at fine time scales interestingly similar ideas can be revealed in several classical hydrological papers cf review by tsoukalas et al 2018a and tsoukalas 2019 beyond the hydrological domain more details about the nataf s model as well as its relationship with the gaussian copula are provided by lebrun dutfoy 2009 herein we briefly discuss the theoretical background and key implementation steps of the proposed nataf based simulation approach also providing guidelines for its optimal use for convenience we first present the most involved modelling case of multivariate cyclostationary processes and next deal with the simpler case of stationary processes for demonstration we also present a hypothetical study involving the simulation of contemporaneous cross correlated processes we remark that throughout the paper the underbar notation e g x is used to denote a random variable rv while the italic typeface e g x denotes a realization of it 2 1 cyclostationary processes in general cyclostationarity is regarded as a special type of non stationarity that implies a cyclic switching on the marginal and joint characteristics of the process over a period e g year to elaborate let x s n be an m dimensional multivariate cyclostationary process each individual process x s n i is consisted of s 1 s sub periods e g months while n z denotes the time index the sub period i e season that corresponds to a time step n may be recovered by s n mod s while when n mod s 0 we get s s this process can also be written as x s t where now t z denotes the period e g year in this formulation the period t is related with the time index n and sub period s by t 1 n s s for convenience the first formulation will be employed in the following paragraphs due to cyclostationarity each process x s n i is characterized by seasonally varying herein referred to as target marginal distributions f x s i p x s i x while their correlation structure is expressed through the pearson s correlation coefficient ρ s s τ i j corr x s i x s τ j where τ denotes the time lag the index n is omitted for simplicity also let z s n denote an auxiliary m dimensional cyclostationary standard gp with z s i n 0 1 due to cyclostationarity the gp is completely defined by its correlation structure which is expressed through the so called equivalent correlation coefficients ρ s s τ i j corr z s i z s τ j the target process x s n can be established through the auxiliary process z s n via the mapping function 1 x s n i f x s i 1 φ z s n i where f x s i 1 denotes the icdf of f x s i and φ denotes the cumulative density function cdf of the standard gaussian distribution this mapping allow us to relate the target correlation coefficients ρ s s τ i j with the equivalent correlation coefficients ρ s s τ i j of the auxiliary gp tsoukalas et al 2017 2018a specifically they are related by 2 ρ s s τ i j f x s i 1 φ z s i f x s τ j 1 φ z s τ j φ 2 z s i z s τ j ρ s s τ i j d z s i d z s τ j e x s i e x s τ j v a r x s i v a r x s τ j where e and v a r denote the corresponding mean and variance known from the target distributions while φ 2 z s i z s τ j ρ s s τ i j stands for the bivariate standard normal probability density function pdf the relationship of eq 2 is abbreviated as 3 ρ s s τ i j f ρ s s τ i j f x s i f x s τ j 2 2 stationary processes a similar relationship can be established between a target multivariate stationary process x t and an auxiliary multivariate stationary standard gp z t particularly let x t be comprised of m univariate stationary processes x t i indexed using t z furthermore let each one be described by a target cdf f x i p x i x and let their correlation structure be expressed by ρ τ i j corr x t i x t τ j similarly the process z t is a m dimensional stationary standard gp with equivalent correlation structure ρ τ i j corr z t i z t τ j using a similar rationale to the cyclostationary case each target process is established by x t i f x i 1 φ z t i in this case the relationship between the target and equivalent correlation coefficients reads e g biller nelson 2003 tsoukalas et al 2018c 4 ρ τ i j f x i 1 φ z t i f x j 1 φ z t τ j φ 2 z t i z t τ j ρ τ i j d z t i d z t τ j e x i e x j v a r x i v a r x j which is abbreviated as 5 ρ τ i j f ρ τ i j f x i f x j both eqs 3 and 5 imply that the correlation structure of the target process depends on the target distributions and the equivalent correlation structure of the auxiliary gp we underline that the term equivalent is used to highlight the fact that the correlation coefficients of the target process and those of the auxiliary gp rarely coincide due to the non linear mapping operation see embrechts et al 1999 particularly it can be shown liu der kiureghian 1986 that for any pair of correlated rvs x i x j established through a pair of correlated gaussian rvs z i z j using a mapping operation analogous to eq 1 i e x i f x i 1 φ z i we get ρ i j ρ i j where ρ i j and ρ i j denote the target and equivalent i e in the gaussian domain correlation coefficients respectively cf fig 1 in tsoukalas et al 2018a 2 3 estimation of equivalent correlation coefficients given eqs 3 and 5 it is possible to establish a variety of approaches to simulate processes with a priori specified target marginal distributions and target correlation structures this specification is subject to several criteria which are discussed in sections 2 4 2 6 nevertheless an essential step for ensuring the reproduction of target correlations through eq 3 or eq 5 for cyclostationary and stationary processes respectively is the identification of the equivalent correlation coefficients this is implemented by establishing and then inverting the corresponding f relationships among the available methods e g biller nelson 2003 cario nelson 1996 1997 liu der kiureghian 1986 herein we will employ the monte carlo procedure by tsoukalas et al 2017 2018a due to its efficiency and straightforward implementation since it avoids the use of integration methods for a method comparison see tsoukalas et al 2018c 2 4 admissible marginal distributions as already explained nataf based models can be used for the simulation of processes with arbitrary continuous discrete or mixed type marginal distributions and valid correlation structures provided that their combination is feasible i e leads to a positive definite correlation structure and the variance of the distributions is finite which is true when modelling hydrometeorological processes koutsoyiannis 2016 regarding the marginal distributions and in contrast to the classical working paradigm of stochastic hydrology it is stressed that by design nataf based models do not aim at resembling the process s moments in fact they aim to simulate processes with target a priori specified distributions in order to fully describe their marginal properties cf discussion by tsoukalas et al 2018a in this respect questions about skewness handling or how many moments should be reproduced for approximating the distribution of a specific process are now out of interest for instance within nataf based schemes simulating a process following a gamma or log normal distribution requires the identification of just two parameters shape and scale which can be easily determined by straightforward methods even the classical method of product moments would ensure reliable estimations since in these specific cases it only requires computations up to second order lombardo et al 2014 in a more general context the nataf based approach offers the flexibility to employ robust fitting methods for parameter estimation that rely on alternative notions such as maximum likelihood probability weighted moments greenwood et al 1979 or l moments hosking 1990 in our view this is a major advantage since it can avoid the data driven estimation of high order moments e g kurtosis or higher since it is well known that they are prone to sample uncertainties and bias lombardo et al 2014 matalas 1967p 945 appendix a summarizes all distribution models employed in this work which were generally fitted using the l moments method 2 5 specific case mixed distributions mixed distributions are often advocated within hydrological applications either to better represent the tails of the understudy hydrometeorological variable e g evin et al 2018 foufoula georgiou lettenmaier 1987 furrer katz 2008 li et al 2013 wilks 1998 or to simultaneously represent the dual character of intermittent processes e g bárdossy pegram 2016 cannon 2008 papalexiou 2018 serinaldi 2009 tsoukalas et al 2018c williams 1998 herein we briefly describe the second case which can be accomplished using a zero inflated also referred to as zero augmented or discrete continuous distribution model this model is composed of both a discrete and a continuous part and its cdf is given by 6 f x x p d x 0 p d 1 p d g x x x 0 the discrete part is represented by p d p x 0 and denotes the probability of a zero value the continuous part is given by g x f x x 0 p x x x 0 which denotes a continuous distribution function for the non zero data for instance within the context of intermittent hydrometeorological processes e g rainfall p d stands for the probability of a dry interval i e probability dry and g x represents the distribution of positive amounts in real world situations the most straightforward way to specify p d and g x is through the available data specifically p d is estimated as the ratio of dry occurrences to the total number of observations while g x can be identified by fitting a continuous distribution function to the positive amounts for completeness the icdf of the zero inflated model which can be used for rvs generation is given by 7 f x 1 u 0 0 u p d g x 1 u p d 1 p d p d u 1 the implementation of eq 6 for simulating intermittent process in a context similar to nataf based models has been recently justified by papalexiou 2018 see also the similarly constructed three component distribution function employed by kossieris et al 2019 aiming to simultaneously describe both the discrete continuous character i e intermittent nature and tail behavior of water demand processes at fine time scales up to 1 minute 2 6 admissible correlation structures classical stochastic modelling strategies are designed to reproduce a limited number of low order dependence metrics in space and time typically expressed in terms of pearson s correlation coefficients actually most of them still follow the specifications posed by matalas and wallis 1976 thus aiming to reproduce just two dependencies i e lag 1 autocorrelations and lag 0 cross correlations we remark that herein the term spatial correlation will denote any dependence between different processes either referring to different geographical locations or not more modern approaches suggest the use of theoretical models for the mathematical description of the auto and cross dependence structures that span over any lag e g gneiting 2000 gneiting schlather 2004 koutsoyiannis 2000 2016 papalexiou 2018 these typically concern stationary processes and are based on the notions of correlation spectrum or variance over aggregated time scales which are all interrelated see beran 1994 koutsoyiannis 2016 the use of theoretical dependence models instead of sample statistics is mostly implied from the significant uncertainties and biases of data driven estimates arguably the most popular type of theoretical dependence models are correlation based ones these can be further classified to full spatiotemporal models chilès delfiner 1999 genton kleiber 2015 gneiting et al 2010 which simultaneously model the auto and cross correlation structure of the process and separable e g genton 2007 mardia goodall 1993 rodríguez iturbe mejía 1974 which describe the two correlation structures independently as the product of two functions i e one for the spatial and one for the temporal component throughout this work and without loss of generality since alternative models can be used we will employ the separable approach specifically we model directly the lag 0 contemporaneous cross correlations of the processes while the auto dependence structure of each individual stationary process is modelled using the two parameter cauchy type autocorrelation structure cas introduced by koutsoyiannis 2000 8 ρ τ c a s κ β 1 κ β τ 1 β τ 0 where β 0 and κ 0 are model parameters the specific case β 0 is also feasible through the use of l hôpital s rule and represents arma type processes see koutsoyiannis 2000 by construction cas can resemble a wide spectrum of processes characterized by both short and long range dependence i e srd and lrd e g efstratiadis et al 2014 tsoukalas et al 2018c srd refers to a stochastic process with a weak autocorrelation structure e g exponential that decays rapidly while lrd implies the exact opposite in this case the autocorrelation structure is a slowly decreasing function typically power type of the time lag beran 1994 beran et al 2013 koutsoyiannis 2002 o connell et al 2016 this type of auto dependence is also associated with the widely studied hurst phenomenon hurst 1951 nowadays also referred to as hurst kolmogorov hk dynamics koutsoyiannis 2011 koutsoyiannis montanari 2007 as well as with the fractional gaussian noise process e g mandelbrot wallis 1969 these properties and its parsimonious character as the model has only two parameters make cas a good candidate model for modelling hydrometeorological processes regarding parameter identification the most straightforward option is to fit cas to the empirical estimates of autocorrelation coefficients however this simple approach neglects the estimator s biases e g beran 1994 koutsoyiannis 2016 marriott pope 1954 which are considered to be significant in the presence of lrd and for large time lags due to small sample sizes in such cases it may be advantageous to explicitly account for bias by using alternative robust parameter identification procedures such as the climacogram e g dimitriadis koutsoyiannis 2015 koutsoyiannis 2016 or even through empirical approaches accounting for regional information and user expertise efstratiadis et al 2014 in summary the combined use of nataf based models along with theoretical distribution functions and theoretical correlation structures e g cas offers several advantages such as easy exploration of alternative scenarios by perturbing the models parameters regional transferability through spatial interpolation improved model stability since a valid correlation structure owes to be positive definite a fact guaranteed by a proper theoretical model decoupling of parameter identification involving the parameters of the distribution model and the theoretical correlation structure and generation mechanism 2 7 the auxiliary gaussian processes in order to deploy a nataf based stochastic simulation scheme it is finally required to simulate realizations from an auxiliary gaussian process gp model that preserves the equivalent correlation coefficients which in turn after the mapping procedure reproduces the target stochastic structure a convenient option is the use of gaussian linear stochastic models often called time series models characteristic examples adapted from operations research are the works of cario and nelson 1996 and biller and nelson 2003 who used as an auxiliary gp univariate and multivariate stationary autoregressive ar processes respectively the resulting nataf based models are termed autoregressive to anything arta and vector autoregressive to anything varta a notable difference of these works compared to our approach lies in the fact that the previous works did not employ the notion of theoretical correlation structures this implies that the order p of the associated ar model dictates the correlation structure of the process to simulate this may be also the reason for the typical use of low order models on the other hand if the auto correlation structure has been a priori specified e g using cas it is possible to employ high order models e g ar p without sacrificing parsimony in this case the order of the gp model solely controls the degree of resemblance of the correlation structure up to the desired lag τ since a higher order model provides more flexibility while the associated model s parameters can be viewed as internal coefficients for a bivariate example see section 2 9 in the water resources domain a comprehensive treatment of multivariate and univariate nataf based schemes based on stationary and cyclostationary gaussian linear stochastic models is presented by tsoukalas et al 2018c and tsoukalas et al 2017 2018a respectively as well as by papalexiou 2018 in this work aiming to develop a multi scale consistent simulation scheme see section 4 we employ and couple in a pairwise basis several nataf based models which use different gp models all of them also capable of multivariate simulations see the summary and the abbreviations of table 1 from the aforementioned models smarta and cmarta are designed for stationary processes while sparta for cyclostationary ones i e accounting for the season to season correlations a common characteristic of the three models is the direct reproduction of lag 0 cross correlations coefficient among multiple contemporaneous processes smarta and sparta are fully described in the works cited in table 1 while a detailed description of the auxiliary gaussian cmar p model is given in appendix b it is stressed that regardless of the choice of the auxiliary gp model in order to generate realizations with the equivalent correlation structure the model parameters have to be estimated using the equivalent correlation coefficients for this reason within the description of cmar p we employ the tilde notation see appendix b 2 8 brief overview via a step by step procedure for a given stochastic process univariate case or a set of processes multivariate case to simulate the required methodological steps of any nataf based model are step 1 identify the type i e stationary or cyclostationary of the processes accounting for process properties and the time scale of simulation step 2 based on the available information e g historical data as well as the user expertise assign appropriate target marginal distributions to all processes and identify the target correlation structure in time and case of multivariate simulation space step 3 select a suitable linear stochastic model to simulate the auxiliary gp step 4 estimate the equivalent correlation coefficients for all pairs of variables that are required by the parameter estimation procedure of the auxiliary model i e gp step 5 estimate the parameters of the gp model through the equivalent correlation coefficients step 6 generate a synthetic time series by employing the gp i e z t o r z s n step 7 map the auxiliary i e gaussian time series to the actual domain in order to attain a realization of the target process i e x t o r x s n the methodology and simulation models described in section 2 as briefly summarized by the above described step by step procedure has been implemented in the anysim r package tsoukalas and kossieris 2019 which enables the straightforward and easy generation of synthetic time series with any distribution and correlation structure 2 9 a hypothetical simulation example to enhance readability we employ cmarta p and setup three bivariate hypothetical simulation experiments hereafter termed a b and c that regard the simulation of two contemporaneously cross correlated stationary processes x t 1 and x t 2 with either zero inflated or discrete marginal distributions for convenience the three experiments share some common assumptions which are 1 the order of the auxiliary gaussian cmar p model which is set to be p 100 2 the length of the synthetic time series to simulate i e 100000 steps 3 the target lag 0 cross correlation coefficient i e ρ 0 1 2 0 70 and 4 the target auto dependence structure of each process which is provided by cas i e eq 8 i e x t 1 ρ τ cas 1 β 0 κ 0 67 and x t 2 ρ τ cas 2 β 1 2 κ 1 as briefly mentioned earlier and since the autocorrelation structure of the processes is already specified the use of a high order gp model i e cmar p in this example does not introduces additional parameters but solely controls the degree of resemblance of the target correlation structure particularly by setting p 100 the model will resemble the target cas up to time lag 100 while for τ 100 it will reduce according to its theoretical properties similarly if we employed a higher order model e g p 1000 we would resemble the target cas up to time lag τ 1000 without needing more parameters for the description of the autocorrelation structure the three simulation studies differ in terms of target marginal distributions of the individual processes more specifically in case a it is assumed that the marginal distribution is provided by a zero inflated model i e eq 6 with p d 0 80 and p d 0 75 for x t 1 and x t 2 respectively while the continuous part is given by the gamma g and log normal l n distribution eq a 1 and eq a 2 respectively particularly they are for x t 1 by g a 0 20 b 0 15 and for x t 2 by l n a 1 b 1 in case b the target distributions are regarded to be discrete and given by the poisson distribution p o i see also eq a 5 particularly we assume that x t 1 p o i λ 1 and x t 2 p o i λ 2 finally in case c we assigned a discrete type bernoulli distribution b e r n see eq a 6 specifically x t 1 b e r n p 0 8 and x t 2 b e r n p 0 75 case a can be considered as the most common simulation scenario since it involves the multivariate simulation of intermittent processes with zero inflated non gaussian marginal distributions for instance it could represent fine time rainfall processes at two locations on the other hand cases b and c can arise in practice when aiming to model counting e g number of drought events in a given year or occurrence e g sequences of wet and dry transitions processes respectively regarding cmarta p implementation and evaluation for case studies a c let us focus on the first case since the simulation procedure as well as the results are similar for all three cases given that the target distributions red line in fig 1c d auto correlation structure red line in fig 1h i and lag 0 cross correlation red line for τ 0 in fig 1j are already known we begin by estimating the required f relationships fig 1e g these are subsequently inverted to estimate the corresponding equivalent correlation coefficients and the parameters of the auxiliary gp model i e cmar p next a bivariate realization of the gp process i e z t z t 1 z t 2 t with the desired length in this case 100 000 is generated the final step involves the mapping of the gaussian process to attain a realization of the target one i e x t x t 1 x t 2 t using the corresponding icdf i e x t i f x i 1 φ z t i the validity of the model is verified by the plots of fig 1 case a fig c 1 case b and fig c 2 case c which illustrate that cmarta is able to accurately reproduce the probabilistic and stochastic structure of the target processes regardless if the marginal distributions are zero inflated or discrete 3 addressing multi scale consistency the above simulation framework although fulfilling the requirements of a good stochastic model i e the explicit reproduction of any distribution and any correlation structure it does not account for multi scale consistency since the problem is independent of the generation procedure and the time scale of simulation we first provide a global overview and then propose a generic solution for nataf based models herein referred to as nataf based disaggregation to anything nda 3 1 problem description let us begin from the univariate case denoting by ω n n z a discrete time stationary or cyclostationary the season indicator s is omitted for simplicity stochastic process at time scale k 1 where n is a time index let also define the aggregated process ω l k at a higher time scale k z 2 obtained by 9 ω l k n l 1 k 1 kl ω n where l is the time index of the aggregated process alternatively e g if ω n refers to an instantaneous quantity we can define the averaged process also denoted by ω l k by ω l k n l 1 k 1 kl ω n k apparently the properties of ω n at scale k 1 are related with those of the aggregated or averaged process at a higher time scale k z 2 herein without loss of generality we focus on the aggregated case to simplify we first remark that the operations implied by eq 9 can be viewed as a sum of k rvs thus if we were interested in the distribution of ω l k it would be the same as solving an aggregated distribution problem if the process ω n is stationary at k 1 then at any higher scale k we would have the sum of k identical rvs on the other hand if ω n is cyclostationary at the lower scale k 1 at any higher scale k we would have the sum of k non identical rvs their marginal and dependence properties depend on the season s 1 s implied by the time index n see section 2 1 arguably the problem of identifying the distribution of ω l k at k 1 is particularly challenging since there is no general method without resorting to simulation to identify the distribution of the sum of k rvs especially in the presence of dependence which is typical for hydrometeorological processes furthermore apart from some low order moments i e mean variance autocovariance and autocorrelation higher order moments of the aggregated process are also particularly difficult to estimate either analytically or theoretically analogously it is also challenging to specify a process ω n that has the desirable for this time scale marginal and stochastic properties when it is aggregated at a higher scale k 1 the problem becomes even harder when multiple processes are involved in the context of multivariate simulation problems let ξ t ξ t 1 ξ t m t and ω n ω n 1 ω n m t be two m dimensional vectors of two discrete time processes ξ t i and ω n i indexed using t z and n z respectively furthermore let assume that ξ t i and ω n i represent the same process at two different temporal scales higher and lower respectively with time units denoted by δ ξ and δ ω respectively i e δ ξ δ ω similarly to eq 9 when k k δ ξ δ ω e g 1 year 1 month 12 or 1 month 1 hour 28 24 30 24 31 24 depending on the number of days of the month we obtain an aggregated process at the same temporal level of ξ t i i e 10 ξ t i ω l i k n l 1 k 1 l k ω n i l t evidently when ω n i is simulated without reference to the higher level process ξ t i then ξ t i ξ t i hence for each process i 1 m our target is to generate a k dimensional random sequence ω t k i ω t 1 k 1 i ω t k i of the low level process k 1 with the desirable properties which honors the equality ξ t i ξ t i when aggregated to the time scale k the multivariate formulation of the problem is written as ω t k ω t k 1 t ω t k m t t ω t 1 k 1 1 ω t k 1 ω t 1 k 1 m ω t k m a n d 11 ξ t ξ t 1 ξ t m t n t 1 k 1 t k ω n 1 n t 1 k 1 t k ω n m t 3 2 the nda approach step by step implementation in order to address the problem we develop the nataf based disaggregation to anything nda approach which combines nataf based models considered as data generation mechanisms with a coupling procedure that encompasses the notions of repetitive sampling and adjusting procedures these two key notions are thoroughly discussed by koutsoyiannis and manetas 1996 the nda procedure starts from a given realization ξ t of a process ξ t at a specific time scale aiming to produce a consistent realization ω n at a lower scale the given realization ξ t is known either from observations or already generated by another model deterministic or stochastic in the second case if a nataf based model is employed the synthesized higher level realization would have the desirable marginal distributions and correlation structure hence the problem would reduce to generating a lower level realization with the target properties which when aggregated to the higher level honors the additive property fulfilling both conditions allows preserving the properties of the process at both temporal levels given that the realization at the higher level is kept as is therefore given the realization ξ t and assuming a temporary nataf based lower level process denoted by ω n with properties identical to those of the target process ω n i e ω n ω n the following steps are applied for all time indices t 1 using a nataf based model cf table 1 generate n ξ ω temporary realizations ω n of the lower level process ω n of length k thus obtaining n ξ ω sets of matrices ω t k ν ν 1 n ξ ω 2 for each of the n ξ ω matrices ω t k estimate the corresponding vector ξ t and obtain a set of vectors ξ t ν ν 1 n ξ ω 3 calculate the difference between ξ t v and the known ξ t using a distance metric e t ν d ξ t ν ξ t 4 formulate the set e t ν ν 1 n ξ ω and select the realization ω t k v with the minimum value of e t ν hereafter denoted ω t k the breve notation has been omitted for simplicity under this premise by aggregating ω t k to time scale k thus obtaining the corresponding sum ξ t its difference with the target values of ξ t will be the minimum over the simulated set 5 produce the final values of ω t k by adjusting the remaining difference between ξ t and ξ t by employing a specific adjusting procedure we remark that since we employ nataf based models in order to ensure a proper sequential generation procedure it is essential to maintain an archive of the realizations generated by the auxiliary gp model these are needed to condition the generation mechanism on the required number of previous values for instance if we employ cmarta p for generating the temporary realizations ω n p previous values of the auxiliary gaussian realization are needed to condition the generation of ω n 1 3 3 computational details for convenience within repetitive sampling step 3 we employ as a distance metric the following quantity also used by koutsoyiannis and manetas 1996 12 e t d ξ t ξ t 1 m i 1 m ξ t i ξ t i var ξ t i on the other hand all available adjusting procedures aps that are found in the literature see grygier stedinger 1988 harms campbell 1967 koutsoyiannis 2001 are compatible with the proposed approach here we employ the so called proportional ap that can be implemented independently for each ω t k i and reads as 13 ω t k i ω t k i ξ t i ξ t i apart from its simplicity key advantage of this ap is the preservation of the sign of each realization ω t k i for instance in case of rainfall where the underlying nataf based model is combined with a mixed type distribution to represent intermittency see section 2 5 the proportional adjustment not only prohibits the generation of negative rainfall values but also preserves the sequence of zero and non zero values as explicitly foreseen by the auxiliary nataf model a final technical issue involves the termination criteria for repetitive sampling here we consider that the iterative procedure terminates when reaching a maximum number of allowable iterations n ξ ω an alternative option would imply the use of a convergence criterion by means of a similarity metric between ξ t and ξ t nevertheless the stopping criteria should be carefully assigned since they control both the accuracy and computational efficiency of nda which are inherently conflicting in our examples we set n ξ ω 250 to 350 which was heuristically identified as a fair conciliation for multivariate problems involving up to five processes we remark that for the univariate case per se papalexiou et al 2018 addressed the challenge of a priori determining the required number of iterations within disaggregation through bernoulli trials we remark that in contrast to other disaggregation schemes where repetitive sampling had an optional role cf koutsoyiannis manetas 1996 in our approach its role is pivotal since it allows the preservation of the advantages of nataf based models and hence generate lower level realizations with the target probabilistic and stochastic properties 4 modular framework for developing multi temporal simulation schemes 4 1 multi temporal stochastic simulation as a puzzle game as already discussed there does not exist a general bottom up solution to the problem of multi scale consistency by means of a generation procedure that provides consistent synthetic data at a time scale of interest and simultaneously captures the scale varying stochastic probabilistic behavior of the aggregated process at higher time scales in a practical context the generally accepted requirement for a good stochastic model is to reproduce the desirable probabilistic and dependence properties across specific temporal scales that have operational interest typically these follow the standard resolutions of hydrometeorological time series i e annual monthly daily hourly etc in this context we propose a puzzle type implementation of nda to address multi scale simulation problems of any complexity essentially this can be done by coupling in a pairwise manner multiple nataf based models which operate independently of each other thereby one can establish a modular top down approach starting from the first level which corresponds to the highest time scale of interest and subsequently moving to next levels until reaching the lowest scale which is dictated by the simulation problem at hand as shown in fig 2 each individual coupling of subsequent scales through nda can be considered as the pieces of a puzzle the generic design of nda ensures flexibility regarding the combination of temporal scales while at the same time the robustness of the underlying nataf based approach ensures the preservation of the desirable process properties for demonstration we next present a typical configuration of this puzzle by means of a three level scheme for annual to daily simulation which is of significant interest for a wide range of operational hydrological problems in section 5 we explore the capacities of this configuration in the context of a real world case study involving the generation of synthetic daily rainfall and runoff series moreover in section 6 we present another useful configuration this time for handling a classical disaggregation problem i e the generation of hourly rainfall from a given daily time series 4 2 three level configuration for annual to daily simulation in this configuration we couple three nataf based models shown in table 1 to provide a multivariate three level simulation scheme this modular scheme i e puzzle aims to preserve the probabilistic and dependence properties of typical hydrometeorological processes at the annual monthly and daily scales let y t y t 1 y t m t be a vector of m stationary stochastic process at the annual time scale where t t y denotes the time index i e year over the set t y in the context of this configuration we model the annual processes using smarta in order to preserve the distribution function of y t i i e f y i y its autocorrelation structure ρ y τ i c o r r y t i y t τ i the lag 0 cross correlations among processes y t i and y t j i e ρ y i j c o r r y t i y t j on the other hand the standard hypothesis for the monthly time scale is cyclostationarity let the monthly process be represented by an m dimensional vector x s n x s n 1 x s n m t where s 1 12 1 12 denotes the month and n t x is the time index the index t of the annual process i e the year may be recovered by t 1 n s 12 for monthly simulation we employ sparta in order to resemble the seasonally varying marginal distribution of x s n i i e f x s x f x s 12 x the lag 1 month to month correlation coefficients ρ x s s 1 i c o r r x s i x s 1 i the lag 0 cross correlations among processes x s i and x s j for each season s i e ρ x s i j c o r r x s i x s j finally the hydrometeorological processes at sub monthly time scales e g daily are typically regarded to be stationary within in each month s in this respect let w s d w s d 1 w s d m t be an m dimensional vector of stationary processes at month s where d t w s denotes the time index we remark that in this case k δ x s δ w s where δ x s and δ w s denote the time units of x s n i and w s d i respectively for instance if w s d i represents the process of month s at the daily temporal level k d s where d s stands for the days of a month s i e 28 30 or 31 excluding leap years similarly if w s d i denotes an hourly process then k d s 24 nonetheless for the simulation of daily temporal level we employ cmarta model and aim to reproduce the seasonally varying marginal distribution of w s n i i e f w s w f w s n w the within month autocorrelation

of the individual models have been identified see section 2 8 for a general overview as well as appendix d for a model specific description the simulation procedure starts with generating a realization of the annual processes using the smarta model and subsequently moves to the monthly and daily level through the nda approach the overall procedure is organized as follows 4 2 1 generation of annual synthetic time series using smarta synthesize an m dimensional realization of the annual process y t with t 1 t where t denotes the desirable simulation length the synthesized realization is represented by a m t matrix y i e y y 1 1 y t 1 y 1 m y t m 4 2 2 generation and adjustment of monthly synthetic time series by construction the realization y t fulfils the specifications of the annual level hence the next step is to generate t realizations of the monthly multivariate process x s n each of length 12 i e equal to the number of months these realizations have to reproduce the specifications implied for the monthly time scale and additionally when aggregated to the annual temporal level to honor the additive property i e y t i n t 1 12 1 12 t x s n i therefore for each year t 1 t we employ nda with the sparta model as the generation mechanism by setting ξ t y t and ω n x s n and obtain t matrices x 1 x t x t which contain the final adjusted monthly realizations each matrix has the form x t x 1 t 1 12 1 1 x 12 t 12 1 x 1 t 1 12 1 m x 12 t 12 m finally the matrices are concatenated in x x 1 x t x t 4 2 3 generation and adjustment of daily synthetic time series for the disaggregation of monthly generated values to the daily temporal level and given the previous matrix organization it is convenient to refer to the obtained adjusted monthly realization with reference to season s and year t not time index n i e x s t where s 1 12 and t 1 t for instance in this notation x 3 2 refers to the third month of the second year at this point we have at our disposal a realization at the monthly level of length 12 t and seek to generate an equal number of realizations of the daily time scale each one with length d s i e 30 31 or 28 similarly to the previous level and for the same reasons we want the realizations of w s d to resemble the specifications of the sub monthly time scale and fulfil the additive property i e x s t i d t 1 d s 1 d s t w s d i in this vein for each month s 1 12 and year t 1 t employ nda using cmarta for data generation by setting ξ t x s t and ω n w s d and obtain 12 t matrices w s t which contain the final adjusted daily realizations i e w s t w s t 1 d s 1 1 w s t d s 1 w s t 1 d s 1 m w s t d s m finally the matrices are concatenated in w w 1 1 w 12 1 w 1 t w 12 t which contains the complete sequence of the daily realization 5 case study a multi temporal simulation of daily rainfall and runoff processes to assess the performance of the aforementioned three level configuration scheme we selected a case study that regards the contemporaneous synthesis of daily rainfall and runoff data at the river basin of achelous western greece upstream of kremasta dam draining an area of 3570 km2 fig 3 a and b the evaluation of the model is performed at all time scales of interest daily monthly annual by comparing the empirical simulated and theoretical i e target marginal and stochastic characteristics of both the daily and aggregated data the time horizon of simulation is 2000 years i e 730000 days fig 3c and d regarding the model parameterization we employed a theoretical autocorrelation model i e cauchy type cas eq 8 for describing the auto dependence structure of the processes at the annual and daily time scales it is noted that at the daily scale the parameters of cas were varied on a monthly basis furthermore the target distribution functions were varied according to the time scale of simulation the season and the type of processes i e runoff or rainfall in all cases the parameters of the distribution functions have been identified on the basis of historical data using the l moments method particularly in the case of runoff we modeled the data using either the three parameter log normal l n eq a 2 the generalized gamma g g eq a 3 or the burr type xii b r x i i eq a 4 distribution on the hand for the daily rainfall process which is characterized by intermittent behavior we employed the zero inflated distribution model of eq 6 using for the continuous component one of the aforementioned distributions starting from the annual temporal level fig 4 summarizes the ability of the highest level model to preserve both the target distribution function and the autocorrelation structure of each process furthermore the model resembled the lag 0 cross correlation among the two processes with high accuracy the historical and simulated values are 0 813 and 0 815 respectively the high values are physically explained by the significantly rich hydrological conditions of the basins it is noted that the parameters of cas have been manually fine tuned in order to increase the degree of annual long range dependence and stress test the capabilities of the associated simulation scheme figs 5 and 6 a provides a quick outlook of the results obtained at the monthly time scale preserving with high accuracy the empirical l moments the seasonality expressed by means of month to month correlation coefficients as well as the lag 0 cross correlations beyond summary statistics a more challenging test is the reproduction of the monthly target marginal distributions figs 7 and 8 compare the empirical distribution of the historical and synthetic data with the target theoretical model the fitted distribution as well as its parameters are shown in the title of each sub plot in all cases the model resembled the target distribution with notable accuracy the previous figures illustrate the ability of the integrated model to generate cyclostationary realizations that are also consistent with the specifications of the annual temporal level as an additional diagnostic and to test the model for envelope behavior we employed scatter plots and depicted the established dependence patterns an example is given in fig 9 which depicts the lag 1 month to month dependence patterns of runoff series the scheme does not exhibit the aforementioned behavior yet more interestingly it was found capable of creating a variety of dependence forms which are also in accordance with the historical ones the results obtained for other time scales or rainfall are similar hence not shown herein regarding the lowest level of simulation that is the daily time scale the comparison among summary statistics of figs 10 and 6b depicting the lag 0 cross correlations at daily scale as well as the empirical simulated and theoretical distribution functions depicted in figs 11 and 12 underline the ability of the model to generate consistent realizations with the higher levels and also preserve the target distribution functions of the daily process which at this time scale are characterized by considerably heavier tails notice that for daily runoff and for the months february to may we selected the b r x i i model which is a heavy tailed distribution with power type tail recall that the r th moment of the b r x i i exist only if a 1 a 2 r remarkably nda accurately simulated even february s daily runoff which is characterized by a 1 a 2 2 90 implying that it only has finite mean and variance furthermore to this figs 13 and 14 depict a monthly based comparison of the empirical simulated and theoretical autocorrelation function acf of the daily process which in most cases deviates from the typical ar 1 acf that most daily stochastic models are capable of simulating inspection of this figure reveals that the integrated model can resemble the theoretical auto dependence structure with high precision this result stems from the combination within nda of two modelling components the cmarta and the use of theoretical auto dependence structure e g cas an additional assessment of model s performance concerns its capabilities regarding the reproduction of statistical characteristics that are not explicitly modelled by the method these may involve marginal properties at intermediate temporal scales as well as a plethora of other features such as transition probabilities dry wet spells and asymptotic properties associated with the reproduction of extremes in this context in order to evaluate the model s behavior at the intermediate time scales between daily and monthly we aggregated the historical and synthetic daily series at several scales k 2 d s and compared on a monthly basis the l mean l 1 k l scale l 2 k l skewness l cs k coefficients and the probability dry p d k at each scale k this analysis is presented in the supplementary material figs s1 s8 as shown although the intermediate time scales i e k 1 d s are not explicitly modelled neither by the three level scheme or nda the arguably good agreement with historical data can be attributed to the accurate simulation of the process at daily and monthly time scales in the supplementary material we further explore the intermittency related features of daily rainfall by comparing the dry and wet spell distributions fig s9 as well as the transition probabilities between dry dry and wet wet sequences fig s10 in this case also the synthetic data exhibit a satisfactory agreement with the historical ones which is mainly attributed to the reproduction of the auto dependencies in combination with the flexibility provided by the mixed type distributions however in our view an even more important evidence of the model s success involves the reproduction of the extremes in this vein fig 15 depicts the empirical and simulated daily annual maxima as well as the fitted using the l moments method to the historical data generalized extreme value g e v distribution i e eq a 7 as shown in both cases the model manages to resemble the distributional form of the identified g e v distribution characterized by an arguably heavy tailed behavior which is expressed through the fréchet distribution since a 0 reasonably this behavior is attributed to the concise reproduction of the distributions at the daily time scale which was modelled using either the power type b r x i i or the l n distribution we recall that at each month we applied different distribution models based on empirical criteria and hydrological evidence 6 case study b disaggregation of daily rainfall to hourly scale to demonstrate the flexibility provided by nda as well the potential to extend the three level scheme of section 4 for even lower temporal levels we now provide a two level configuration for disaggregating a univariate daily sequence to the hourly scale this scheme is applied to an hourly rainfall dataset at oberstdorf germany provided from the german weather service deutscher wetterdienst station id 3730 the historical data extend over the period 01 09 1995 to 31 12 2017 fig 16 in this example we do not aim to generate synthetic data that represents the actual process across multiple time scales of interest such as in case study a in contrast our goal is to provide a synthetic hourly realization under the following requirements the synthetic data at the hourly scale reproduces the probabilistic and stochastic properties of the historical sample the additive property is preserved between the aggregated hourly k 1 synthetic data and the corresponding historical ones k 24 by definition in disaggregation problems the synthetic sequence has the same length as the given data to cope with the effect of seasonality we employ the typical assumption for fine time scale rainfall processes e g daily hourly or finer that of cyclical stationarity with annual period and monthly sub period see also section 4 assuming that the sequence w s d denotes the observed daily records for month s we simulate an hourly process e g η s h h z which is also considered stationary within month s this implies that the distribution function f η s of the process as well as its auto correlation structure i e ρ η s τ c o r r η s h η s h τ remain invariant within the month s furthermore to account for temporal consistency we impose the requirement of generating realizations of the process η s h constrained by w s d w s d where w s d η s l 24 h l 1 24 1 l 24 η s h analogous to eq 10 in order to simulate the hourly rainfall we employ as generation mechanism the univariate version of cmarta which is known as arta cario nelson 1996 we recall that this model uses as an auxiliary gp a gaussian ar process see appendix b 1 the generation scheme is employed on a monthly basis since the hourly process properties are reasonably considered seasonally varying regarding the parameterization of arta the marginal distribution of hourly rainfall of each month is modelled using the zero inflated model of eq 6 in this case for the continuous part we fitted using l moments the g g distribution i e eq a 3 the parameters of the model are shown in fig 16d f for the autocorrelation structure of the hourly rainfall we fitted monthly varying cas models eq 8 to the corresponding empirical autocorrelation coefficients red line in fig 16g i eventually each individual hourly process is modeled using five parameters three for the marginal distribution and two for the autocorrelation structure in fig 16c are shown the synthetic i e disaggregated to hourly scale rainfall data in fig 16d e and g i we show for three representative months february june october that the model resembles with good accuracy the target distributions and autocorrelation structures respectively similarly good performance is achieved for the rest of the months see supplementary material figs s11 and s12 furthermore in order to investigate the behavior of the model at the intermediate time scales 1 k 24 in fig 17 we depict for three characteristics months february june and october both the historical and synthetic series the l mean l 1 k l scale l 2 k l skewness l cs k probability dry p d k and lag 1 autocorrelation coefficient ρ 1 k as a function of the aggregation level k the rest of the months are shown in figs s13 s17 of supplementary material inspection of these plots reveals the potential of the nda approach to preserve the empirical scaling properties of rainfall without requiring the use of cascading of techniques and direct simulation of rainfall at intermediate temporal levels 7 conclusions in order to address the puzzle of multi temporal simulation of hydrometeorological processes we developed a puzzle type approach employing chain implementation of a novel generation procedure called nataf based disaggregation to anything nda this is built upon recent advances in stochastics by means of nataf based models coupled with the concepts of repetitive sampling and adjusting this coupling allows taking advantage of the primary ability of nataf based models to represent stationary processes that exhibit any distribution and any correlation structure the recent extension of nataf based models to simulate cyclostationary as well as multivariate processes offered the essential generality to handle challenging single scale hydrometeorological simulation problems however as widely discussed the reproduction of a target s probabilistic and stochastic behavior at a single temporal scale does not guarantee similarly consistent performance at higher temporal scales in this work the issue of consistency across any pair of scales is handled via the nda approach while the general puzzle type framework enables the transition to multi scale simulations we recall that nda uses nataf based models at two independent scales as underlying data generators and coupling mechanisms to adjust the lower level data to the higher one the above approach ensures significant flexibility since it allows establishing any configuration of scale consistent simulators through pairwise link of ndas this flexibility and the advantages of nda itself have been mainly revealed by configuring a multivariate simulation scheme that reproduces the probabilistic and stochastic properties of the processes of interest at three characteristic temporal scales i e annual monthly and daily in this configuration we integrated different nataf based models for each scale i e smarta for the annual sparta for the monthly and cmarta and incidental contribution of this work for the daily one the multi temporal simulation capabilities of the integrated scheme were evaluated on the basis of a long term bi variate simulation study aiming at the generation of synthetic rainfall and runoff data as shown the model reproduced with accuracy the characteristics of the underlying hydrometeorological processes which exhibit substantial differences among the two processes and across scales and seasons key requirements in this study were the reproduction of a wide range of target distribution functions varying across processes scales and seasons the simultaneous simulation of intermittent and continuous processes i e daily rainfall and runoff exhibiting significant correlations the preservation of target short term and long term auto dependence structures at the annual scale as well as the daily scale on seasonal basis the preservation of target season to season correlations at the monthly scale the preservation of target lag 0 cross correlations at all scales one can observe that in the above bucket list we make repeated use of term target in order to highlight the multidimensional role of the user actually before employing simulations there are several critical modelling decisions to make regarding the assignment of suitable distribution functions and correlation structures to the processes of interest this also involves the selection of time scales to represent thus the configuration of the puzzle this flexibility may offer significant advantages for instance in this specific study the careful selection of the daily distribution models resulted in reproducing the heavy tailed behavior of the observed daily extremes we recall that the reproduction of extremes was not set as an explicit requirement of the model thus making this surprising outcome a promising topic for further research the model performance at even finer temporal scales i e hourly was demonstrated through a disaggregation example where we employed nda for the synthesis of hourly rainfall realizations that are consistent with the observed daily data similarly to the first study the model faithfully reproduced the target behavior of the hourly process simultaneously ensuring consistency with the daily scale moreover it reproduced with accuracy important statistical properties of rainfall expressed in terms of l moments at intermediate scales above all this study highlighted the scale free character of nda as well as its ability to handle hydrological disaggregation problems arguably the potential applications of our puzzle type approach extend beyond the realm of hydrometeorological time series generation or disaggregation essentially it is a general purpose stochastic simulation scheme depending on the synthesis of the puzzle pieces i e chain of ndas as well as the underlying decisions of each nda in terms of target marginal distributions and correlation structures it is possible to apply the method for the simulation of a widely extended range of processes geophysical and socioeconomic beyond simulation other applications of nda may concern downscaling or disaggregation problems which require a replacing the corresponding higher level simulation model with the realizations provided by global or regional climate models and b identifying the marginal and stochastic properties of the lower level model using e g in situ gauging stations regional information and or scaling laws eventually the proposed approach can be employed within broader monte carlo experiments to provide long synthetic input data to deterministic simulation models given that the type and number of processes to simulate as well as their temporal resolution is dictated by the deterministic model a major computational challenge arises in particular the repetitive sampling within nda imposes a bottleneck when applied to high dimensional multivariate problems and or long term simulations at fine time scales potential remediation to this technical problem may be the use of parallel computing or the model implementation in low level programming languages regarding the modelling framework per se potential future research may focus on two interesting aspects that have been revealed in the two case studies the first involves the reproduction of non explicitly preserved statistical features with emphasis to extremes while the second is the validation of the model behavior at intermediate time scales another interesting research target is the comparison with alternative synthetic generation schemes to assess the practical impacts of stochastic model selection in problems that typically rely on synthetic inputs such as water resources planning and management hydrological simulations and flood risk assessment since each problem is influenced by different statistical aspects of the input processes the generality and flexibility of the proposed method makes it favorable for a wide range of applications declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments the authors would like to thank the associate editor and the three reviewers prof

6352,forecasting ice jams and their consequential flooding is more challenging than predicting open water flood conditions this is due to the chaotic nature of ice jam formation since slight changes in water and ice flows location of the ice jam toe along the river and initial water levels at the time of jam formation can lead to marked differences in the outcome of backwater level elevations and flood severity in this paper we introduce a novel operational real time flood forecasting system that captures this stochastic nature of ice jam floods and places the forecasts in a probabilistic context in the form of flood hazard maps probability of flood extents and depths this novel system was tested successfully for the ice cover breakup period in the spring of 2018 along the athabasca river at the town of fort mcmurray canada keywords operational hydrology real time flood forecasting ice jams athabasca river fort mcmurray 1 introduction floods account for the greatest number of hydrological meteorological natural disaster events in canada thistlethwaite and feltmate 2013 and for many canadian rivers the annual peak water levels are due to ice jams eccc 2013 current ice jam flood warning systems require extensive field observations have considerable uncertainty beltaos and burrell 2015 and thus lack reliability nonetheless flood forecasting and hazard mapping are urgently needed by government agencies insurance companies urban planners and developers this research strives to introduce a novel tool to forecast ice jams and assess their subsequent flood hazard in communities along northern rivers forecasting the occurrence of ice jams is challenging for several reasons the processes of ice cover breakup and ice jamming are complex and nonlinear and numerous morphological meteorological and hydrological factors interact during ice jam formation some empirical and process based attempts have been made to develop forecasting methods white 2003 2008 however these often rudimentary models perform with limited success and tend to be very site specific forecasting systems have also been attempted with artificial neural network and fuzzy logic systems sun and trevor 2015 however the physical processes underlying the cause effect relationships of ice jam formation are not considered in such approaches additionally these approaches focus on the temporal occurrence of ice jams with a weak connection to the spatial context consequently success rates for predictions with these approaches are low for instance mahabir 2008 reported that only 4 out of 7 ice jams were predicted successfully at fort mcmurray over a 25 year period some improvement approximately 20 30 is obtained when combinations of multiple models specifically adaptive neuro fuzzy inference systems artificial neural networks and multiple linear regressions are used to predict backwater level elevations sun and trevor 2018 however the computational expense may be too vast in an operational ice jam flood forecasting setting other models have been developed to predict backwater levels of ice jamming events e g river2d brayall and hicks 2012 and hec ras beltaos et al 2012 but only deterministically without considering the stochastic nature of ice jam formation and flooding only a few attempts have been made with data driven ice jam predication models to predict ice jam flooding severity e g zhao et al 2015 however most forecasting methods as the ones mentioned above generally provide only a yes no prediction to possible flood occurrences we believe that the implications of false positives or even worse false negatives assuming a positive is a flooding condition white and daly 2002 are too great and detrimental if the wrong action or no action is taken in managing a flood when decisions on such binary information are made what is required is a probabilistic forecasting approach to help manage the level of preparedness and mitigation effort exerted when resources are limited such an approach is lacking in ice jam flood forecasting forecasting ice jam floods are also more challenging than open water floods due to the chaotic nature of ice jam formation the morphology of the jams can be very dependent on the location of their formation the fluvial geomorphological setting in which they are formed the volume of ice forming the jam and the flow conditions of water and ice from upstream of the jam here we present a novel forecasting methodology in which an ice hydraulic model is placed within a stochastic framework in which an ensemble of backwater staging profiles are simulated to provide a probability of flood extents and depths in the flood hazardous region we find that probabilities of flooding represented by dynamic flood hazard maps can provide forecasters emergency responders and flood managers with essential additional information to better aid in the preparedness and mitigation of ice jam floods 2 ice jams at study site this study was conducted along an approximately 400 km long reach of the athabasca river from the town of athabasca to fort mcmurray fig 1 the athabasca river basin originates at the columbia glacier in jasper national park and flows north eastward from an elevation of 3747 m a s l down to an elevation of 187 m a s l at lake athabasca eum et al 2017 the basin with a drainage area of 1 560 000 km2 plays an important role in supporting economic development in northern alberta eum et al 2017 however ice jams form almost every year she et al 2007 and the consequent flooding poses a big threat to some areas along the river particularly in fort mcmurray s downtown area upstream of fort mcmurray a great number of rapids with sharp bends and slope changes fig 1 typically initiate a dynamic ice cover breakup kowalczyk hutchison and hicks 2007 and contribute to the formation of ice jams most years she et al 2007 in the past ice jams have been observed during the breakup period along different reaches of the river but they pose a higher flood risk at the town of fort mcmurray tfm due to the change from steep to mild river bed slope obstacles to flow islands and bars and presence of several tributaries the 1977 ice jam flooding at the tfm caused 2 6 million dollars of damage claims and the 1997 event also resulted in several millions dollars in damages mahabir et al 2006 inter annually magnitudes and timings of ice cover breakup are highly variable in the reach of the athabasca river upstream of fort mcmurray ice cover breakup in the reach is generally dynamic in a consistent pattern she et al 2007 she et al 2009 typically as air temperature increases snow melting rainfall induced border flow and or local surface runoff increase the thermal deterioration of the ice cover snowmelt in the upper basin can dramatically increase water levels and flow velocities to initiate ice sheet cracking the presence of rapids provides a basis for the formation of small ice jams with toes typically at the knick points this shifting ice produces waves that further break off thermally deteriorated intact ice covers and increases the length of smaller ice jams as ice accumulations continue to increase and the fronts of these ice jams continue to extend these small ice jams ultimately release at the knick points resulting in a sequence of ice runs the flowing ice alternatively rides up onto or submerges below the downstream intact ice covers to break them up she and hicks 2006 progressively these ice runs of released small ice jams and newly broken intact ice covers eventually form larger ice jams particularly as they approach fort mcmurray these larger ice jams usually are dislodged by the running ice of a released ice jam from further upstream 3 data and methods 3 1 modélisation environnementale communautaire surface hydrology mesh the mesh system is a semi distributed physically based land surface hydrological modelling system developed by environment and climate change canada for hydrological applications pietroniro et al 2007 it uses the canadian land surface scheme class verseghy et al 1993 to compute vertical energy and water balance for soil vegetation and snow the model s watrof module simulates lateral movement of soil and surface water to the drainage system and the watroute module provides streamflow routing through the river channels kouwen 1988 to improve computational efficiency while addressing the complexity and heterogeneity of the watershed it uses the group response unit gru approach to combine areas of similar hydrological behavior kouwen et al 1993 for large scale drainage basins this approach has been found to be appropriate due to its operational simplicity while retaining the basic physics and behavior of a distributed model pietroniro and soulis 2003 mesh has been widely used for different river basins e g davison et al 2006 haghnegahdar et al 2014 davison et al 2016 morales marín et al

deterministic precipitation analysis rdpa which consists of 4 daily analyses using 6 hour precipitation accumulation intervals and one daily analysis using a 24 hour precipitation accumulation interval this system covers all of north america on a 10 km grid fortin et al 2015 through statistical interpolation using cmc s regional deterministic prediction system rdps short range precipitation forecasts as the background field with surface network based rain gauge measurements satellite observations and radar derived rain rates mahfouf et al 2007 capa provides reliable estimates of precipitation over canada and has proven to be a suitable forcing product for hydrologic modeling across the country particularly regions in the mid to high latitudes with sparse gauge networks fortin et al 2014 lespinas et al 2015 a recent study by boluwade et al 2018 shows capa to be a reliable forcing input for water resources modeling and predictions 3 3 canadian global deterministic prediction system gdps the global deterministic prediction system gdps operationally run by the canadian meteorological centre cmc is a forecasting system based on the global environmental multiscale model côté et al 1998 and executed in a global configuration the data are available on a 1500 751 latitude longitude grid at a resolution of 0 24 which corresponds approximately to a 25 km resolution the model run starts twice daily 00 00 and 12 00 utc and the system generates a forecast every third hour producing a forecast over 240 h draxler et al 2015 the recent version uses a 4d ensemble variational data assimilation 4denvar system that replaces the previous 4d variational data assimilation 4dvar system which has shown to improve forecasting accuracy buehner et al 2015 note that the rdps product caron et al 2015 is also available from cmc for north america which has higher spatial resolution of approximate 10 km however the lead time available is only 48 h unlike open water forecasting where only streamflows produced by hydrological models may be adequate for flood warning ice jam forecasting requires additional inputs such as incoming ice volume estimations computation of probable stage resulting from ice jamming using river ice hydraulic models and flood inundation mapping from the computed water levels thus though coarser gdps was selected as it would provide adequate lead time for other river ice hydraulic assessments 3 4 rivice the river ice hydraulics were simulated using the one dimensional hydrodynamic model rivice the model was run in wide jam mode in which the thickening of the ice jam is induced by the shoving of ice in the jam due to the increased forces from the flow of the water against the ice jam front thrust and the underside of the ice jam cover drag and the weight of the ice accumulation in the jam weight vector in slope direction these forces are countered by the shear forces of the ice cover against the river banks friction and the support of the ice accumulation due to its thickening ice volume internal resistance more detailed descriptions of the model can be found elsewhere e g eccc 2013 lindenschmidt 2017a sheikholeslami et al 2017 ranges of the parameters associated with this balance of forces have already been calibrated and validated for a number of ice jam events along different river systems lindenschmidt 2017a 2017b 4 forecasting system setup an integrated forecasting setup consisting of all models input data sources outputs from each models and their inter linkages is provided in fig 2 each individual model setup is discussed in the next sections 4 1 mesh setup and calibration greenkenue canadian hydraulics centre 2010 an advanced data preparation analysis and visualization tool was used to prepare the drainage database for this a digital elevation model was retrieved from the canadian digital elevation data though geogratis http geogratis gc ca whereas land use data and soil data were obtained from the natural resource canada and soil data from the soil landscapes of canada respectively the model was setup with a spatial resolution of 0 125 resulting in 1326 grid cells with a drainage area of 132 057 km2 and the outlet at the athabasca river below mcmurray 07da001 mesh requires seven meteorological input files i e precipitation air temperature wind speed barometric pressure specific humidity incoming longwave radiation and incoming shortwave radiation precipitation data was obtained from capa the remaining forcing files were obtained from the global environmental model gem numerical weather prediction model côté et al 1998 that is available at spatial and temporal resolutions of 15 km and 1 h respectively the calibration process was performed using ostrich which is an open source auto calibration and multi algorithm parameter optimization software matott 2005 eight parameters of four dominant grus were calibrated although mesh was run at a three hourly time step output streamflows were generated at a daily scale for comparison and analysis the model was first calibrated for the 2002 2008 period using the nash and sutcliffe efficiency ns and its logarithmic value logns as objective functions the year 2002 was considered a spin up period and the remaining six years were used for the calibration period then the model was validated using an additional subsequent six years 2009 2014 fig 3 shows the results of the mesh calibration and validation for gauging station athabasca river below mcmurray 07da001 with simulated flows having good agreement with measured flows recorded at the gauging station the ns value of 0 68 log ns value of 0 65 and pbias of 6 8 were achieved for the calibration years whereas for the validation years a ns value of 0 66 log ns value of 0 68 and pbias of 6 9 were obtained it is also important to note that hydrological models are subject to different sources of uncertainties firstly the athabasca river basin is characterized by both climatic diverseness and spatial variability in the hydrologic processes due to its dominant physiographic heterogeneity eum et al 2014 modelling large scale northern river basins still remains a great challenge due to limited data parametric uncertainty biondi and de luca 2017 and complexity of snow processes that are difficult to capture numerically similarly some processes and their interactions such as land cover changes feedback between atmosphere and land surfaces and human interventions are not adequately represented in some physically based models debeer et al 2016 4 2 refined mesh calibration for breakup season in the second step the calibrated and validated model parameters were further fine tuned for three ice cover and breakup seasons i e the winters of 2015 2016 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 only the streamflow from 1 october to 31 may were input to the model so as to simulate under ice flow accurately fig 4 shows the model results compared with both observed flows available from the water survey of canada wsc as well as under ice flow measurements from field observations these observations are usually performed three times per winter by wsc to determine the amount of shift required of the open water rating curve to correct for under ice flows the results show that the model is able to simulate under ice flow well this approach of using an ice rating curve for mesh calibration should be considered as a first step in this proof of concept project we understand that ice conditions can vary from year to year e g juxtaposed versus consolidated and ice roughness can change over a season especially for a consolidated ice cover if more years of data were made available the mesh calibration can be improved by using only the directly measured discharge data from a longer time period however the uncertainty in discharge inferred by the ice rating curve is minimal see fig 5 and could be incorporated into the distributions of discharges used in the monte carlo simulations 4 3 rivice setup and calibration detailed descriptions of the calibration and validation of the rivice model adapted to the athabasca river is provided elsewhere see lindenschmidt 2017a 2017b the left panel of fig 6 shows a backwater profile along the athabasca river simulated for the 1977 ice jam event along the athabasca river the water level profile was extrapolated into the floodplain in which fort mcmurray s downtown area is situated to determine flood depth and extents as shown in the right panel of fig 6 good agreement resulted between aerial photographs and the simulated flood extents since the downtown area of fort mcmurray is situated along the lower clearwater river the backwater level attained at the athabasca clearwater river confluence serves as the floodwater level previous hydraulic modelling exercises of the clearwater river have shown that the backwater profile along the clearwater river especially for floods more extreme than the 1 10 year annual exceedance probability aep for that river are near horizontal see fig 7 for the 1977 flood event which approximates a 1 80 aep this suggests the water level at the clearwater river s mouth athabasca clearwater river confluence which also serves as the downstream boundary condition for the clearwater river hydraulic model has a high sensitivity on backwater staging which far exceeds the sensitivity of any parameters or other boundary condition values 4 4 stochastic modelling framework once the parameters of the river ice hydraulic model of the athabasca river were calibrated deterministically the frequency distributions of the boundary conditions i e values of inflowing ice vice and the downstream water level elevation w were calibrated stochastically by comparing the stage frequency distribution of simulated water levels at the gauge location with the stage frequency distribution of the observed water levels recorded at the gauge in the calibration framework the values for both boundary conditions and model parameters are randomly extracted from either uniform pdf or extreme value pdf when a priori knowledge of a pdf shape is not known such as the location of the toe of the ice jam or model parameters a uniform pdf is used upper and lower ranges which constrain the uniform distribution are based on available information from previous studies observational records or typical values available from the literature when extreme value data are available to construct their pdfs such as discharge and water levels an extreme value distribution is used ensembles of water level profiles are simulated within a monte carlo framework using model independent parameter estimation doherty 1994 an industry standard software package for parameter estimation and uncertainty analysis of complex environmental and other computer models this framework allows simulations to be automatically repeated so that hydraulic models can be run hundreds of times using a different set of parameters and boundary conditions for each simulation unlike conventional calibration approaches of using single values or time series such as discharge or stages to measure simulation performance we adopt stage frequency distributions sfd as an objective function for model calibration using sfd as an objective function is a novel approach and offers an effective means of calibrating parameters and boundary conditions of stochastic processes such as ice jamming lindenschmidt 2017b simulated sfds are generated from water level elevations extracted from the simulated water level profiles at a location of interest such as a gauging station where data is available for comparison the extreme value distribution parameters such as scale and location are adjusted until the simulated sfd matches the observed sfd this process can be repeated many times to produce an envelope of simulated sfds firstly the stage frequency distribution of the downstream boundary condition w was calibrated referring to fig 8 estimated flows recorded at the end of breakup from many years when the last b flag is recorded were collated to construct extreme flow frequency distributions depicted in fig 8 a as a histogram the b flag which is provided by the water survey of canada along with hydrometric data denotes ice induced backwater effects due to the presence of ice at or immediately downstream of the gauge in the river the extreme value distribution of the downstream water level fig 8 b at the model s most downstream boundary of the model domain was calibrated by adjusting the distribution s statistical parameters location and scale until the stage frequency distribution fig 8 e from an ensemble of simulated backwater levels at the athabasca gauge fig 8 d coincided with the frequency distributions of observed stage at the end of all breakup periods fig 8 f for this stochastic calibration the frequency distribution of the volume of ice is assumed to be zero fig 8 c since a condition of the end of the ice cover breakup is that the ice cover at the gauge has been flushed out downstream along the river all parameter values not shown in fig 8 are given a uniform distribution within a range between minimum and maximum values secondly now referring to fig 9 with the downstream water level boundary condition distribution in place fig 9 bb the stochastic modelling process is repeated to calibrate the frequency distribution of the inflowing volume of ice vice fig 9 cc the frequency distribution of the ice jam flows fig 9 aa which is very similarly shaped as the end of breakup flow frequency distribution is used as input the statistical parameters of location and scale for vice fig 9 cc are adjusted until the stage frequency distribution fig 9 ee assembled from the backwater stage elevations simulated at the athabasca gauge chainage fig 9 dd coincides with the frequency distribution of the instantaneous maximum stages recorded at the gauge during ice jam events fig 9 ff the resulting histogram of vice provided in fig 10 is used for the forecasting operations notice that the distribution has a maximum of approximately 19 million m3 of ice 4 5 ice volume estimations the volume of ice along the athabasca river upstream of fort mcmurray is an important variable to determine since the ice volume estimates from ice cover extents are important input to the stochastic modelling framework before such estimates can be calculated we first need to determine the ice types roughly categorised into thermal smooth black and consolidated rough white ice consolidated ice covers are generally thicker than thermal ice covers ice cover types were visually identified from radarsat 2 sq16w image acquired on 18 february 2018 see fig 11 ice covers developed by february generally remain unchanged until ice break up the figure shows most of the athabasca river upstream of the bridges having a bright high backscatter signal ice cover appears white in the image and represents the consolidated ice that typically forms along the river at freeze up this reach has a number of rapids which is conducive to frazil ice generation long into the onset of winter and the formation of consolidated ice covers the lighter low backscatter signal ice cover appears purple in the image represents thermal ice covers that would have formed along stretches with more backwater staging at freeze up for water velocities to have become slow enough to form smooth thermal ice once the ice types have been established their thicknesses can be determined ice thicknesses along with the ice cover width and lengths along the reach help estimate the volume of ice of a particular river stretch of interest thermal ice thicknesses h were quantified using the empirical relationship of ice thickening via the cumulative degree days of freezing cddf and ice ablation via the cumulative degree days of melting cddm stefan and fang 1997 zhang et al 2017 1 h α cddf c d d m b where α is a slope and b is an intercept cddf and cddm can be obtained by 2 cddf i d 1 d n t d i 3 cddm i d 1 d n t d i 5 where d1 is starting day for calculating cddf and cddm t is the mean air temperature below 0 c d1 is either the first day of november or the first day of march depending if respectively the cddf or cddm is being calculated when calculating cddm 5 c is added to compensate for the contribution of solar radiation to ice melting zhang et al 2017 daily air temperature data used for computing cddf and cddm were recorded at the fort mcmurray weather station 56 39 04 n 111 12 48 w the thickness of consolidated ice hcon is generally thicker than thermal ice h and was determined by multiplying thermal ice thicknesses with a multiplier m 4 h con h m multipliers are derived from measurements of consolidated ice thickness in the field and comparing them with thermal ice thicknesses at the athabasca gauge thermal ice measurements at the end of march 2018 averaged 0 71 m one consolidated ice measurement yielded a thickness of 0 97 from these two values a multiplier of approximately 1 4 0 97 0 71 was determined ice thickness of consolidated ice was corrected by applying this multiplier to the estimated thermal ice thickness this is similar to other multiplier values determined from consolidated and thermal ice measurements in other years for example m was calculated to be equal to 1 6 from ice thickness measurements carried out in the spring of 2003 hicks and pelletier 2003 5 real time forecasting operations complementing the following text on the methodology of forecasting operations fig 12 depicts the steps taken to forecast ice jam flood hazard forecasting began on 20 april 2018 for the period 21 30 april 2018 when the cumulative degree days of melting cddm was approaching the minimum cddf 113 c days when breakup occurred in the past cddm 137 c days 5 1 mesh 10 day flow forecasts a 10 day forecast of meteorological data was provided by gdps fig 12 i this forecast allowed us to simulate forecasted flows along the athabasca river upstream of the bridges and the clearwater river using the mesh model fig 12 ii referring to fig 13 capa and rdps data was first used to hindcast the previous day s flows and determine all state variables that were saved to be used as initial conditions to drive the next 10 day flow forecast using the gdps data the model simulations and the processing of the data and results were automated and repeated every day to obtain daily flow forecasts always for the next 10 days mesh was run at an hourly time step in hindcasting mode whereas 3 hourly simulations were performed in forecasting mode matching the temporal resolution of the meteorological forcing data the minimum and maximum discharges of a 10 day flow forecast were extracted fig 12 ii and only randomized flows from the flow frequency distribution within the range between the minimum and maximum values fig 12 iii were selected for the monte carlo simulations fig 12 iv 5 2 downstream water level elevation for each forecast a downstream water level elevation was required for the day the forecast was made fig 12 v the probability of the water level elevation recorded at the athabasca gauge was determined from which the corresponding water level elevation at the downstream model boundary was determined fig 12 vi this value established the minimum of the range within the stage frequency distribution fig 12 vii from which random values were extracted for the monte carlo simulations fig 12 iv 5 3 volume of ice estimates the extent of the ice cover was monitored fig 12 viii using modis satellite imagery and aerial surveys of the river if the ice cover was still mostly intact along the upper athabasca river fig 12 ix the full frequency distribution of the volume of ice fig 12 x was used for the monte carlo simulations fig 12 iv if the ice cover was broken up in parts creating open water sections only the volume of ice within the ice cover upstream of fort mcmurray was considered fig 12 ix this volume corresponds to a maximum value within the frequency distribution and only random values within the range up to the maximum fig 12 x were used for the monte carlo simulations fig 12 iv we assumed that the ice that is broken up is either ablated stranded along the shore embedded within shear walls along the river edges or accumulated in the front of the downstream ice cover hence the extent of the ice cover upstream of fort mcmurray may consist of both intact ice and accumulated ice rubble on 24 april 2018 the ice cover along the athabasca river upstream of fort mcmurray was generally intact fig 14 aerial photography confirm that this state of the ice cover remained the same for most of the river on 25 april 2018 hence justifying the use of the full frequency distribution of the volume of ice on 26 april 2018 the ice cover quickly broke up upstream of grand rapids and ran past fort mcmurray hence no further forecasting operations were required 5 4 backwater level calculation once the ranges to constrain the frequency distributions of flow downstream water level elevation and volume of ice were established monte carlo simulations were carried out fig 12 iv that yielded an ensemble of backwater levels fig 12 xi also see fig 15 the water level elevations at the mouth of clearwater river were used to construct flood inundation and extent maps for each simulated water level fig 12 xii the maps were then sorted in ascending order of the number of flooded cells or total flood depths to determine deciles of flood extent and flood depths respectively 5 5 probability of flood inundation extent the monte carlo simulations provided a hundred ice jam water level profiles from which the water levels at the confluence of athabasca river and snye channel were extracted to derive flood extents in the downtown part of fort mcmurray fig 12 xii the study extracted the water levels at the snye channel because the water level at this location provides a more conservative representation of the flood hazard areas in the downtown area each water level was subtracted from the terrain elevation determined from a lidar digital elevation model dem to calculate flood depths to construct the flood depth maps the water surface raster models were interpolated to the cell size of the lidar dem 15 15 m flood extent areas were then determined by estimating the number of flooded cells in the flood depth maps the probability of flooding in this study is defined as the number of times as a percentage the area cell in the flood map can be flooded from the total simulated ice jam water level profiles the study generated hundreds of ice jam water level profiles in the monte carlo framework everyday based on the forecasted range of the boundary value distributions gis tools translated water levels extracted from the profiles at the snye channel chainage to flood probability maps for each map each cell was assigned a 0 if the flood depth was less than 0 and 1 if the flood depth was greater than 0 the relative total number of times each cell had the value 1 determined the probability of that cell of being flooded 5 probability o f f l o o d i n g o f e a c h c e l l number o f t i m e s t h e c e l

6 which is a reflection of the increased flows forecasted by mesh fig 13 the maximum predicted flow from the sixth 10 day forecast was approximately 1100 m3 s to recap fig 17 is derived from fig 12 with real values showing the steps taken exemplarily for forecast 1 first the mesh forecasted discharges were simulated using 10 day forecasted meteorological data fig 17 α the minimum and maximum values of the 10 day flow series are used to constrain the frequency distribution of the breakup discharges fig 17 β only random values from within the minimum maximum range were extracted for the monte carlo simulations fig 17 η the water level at the athabasca river gauge is tracked fig 17 γ and is shifted downward to yield a minimum value of the frequency distribution of the most downstream water level elevations used as the downstream boundary conditions in rivice fig 17 δ downstream water levels are randomly selected from the distribution greater than the minimum value for the monte carlo simulations fig 17 η satellite imagery or airborne photography were used to determine the extent of the ice cover upstream of fort mcmurray fig 17 ε in this example the ice cover is still continuously intact hence the full frequency distribution of the volume of ice is used fig 17 ζ in the monte carlo simulations fig 17 η the monte carlo simulations yield n e g n 100 water level profiles fig 17 θ water level elevations from each profile at the athabasca clearwater river confluence are extracted to produce flood extent maps within the fort mcmurray downtown area counting how many times each dem grid cell in the floodplain is flooded m from all n simulations provides a probability p of flooding for each cell p m n fig 17 ι 6 discussion 6 1 2018 breakup chronology at fort mcmurray in most years it is the formation of a stationary ice jam on the athabasca river at fort mcmurray that causes high water levels on the clearwater river and possible flooding of the town site however in 2018 the ice cover broke up at fort mcmurray and high water levels occurred without the formation of a stationary ice jam this is an atypical breakup pattern for the ice cover at fort mcmurray the onset of breakup occurred at approximately 11 00 mountain standard time mst on 26 april 2018 when a large water wave and ice run pushed the ice cover in fort mcmurray breaking it up and causing high water levels the highest top of ice elevation measured at the highway 63 bridges was 245 412 m see fig 18 these high water and ice levels lasted for approximately 1 5 h as the wave pushed through town on the athabasca river at the same time ice and water from the athabasca river were pushed up the clearwater river breaking the intact ice cover and raising water levels sufficiently to cause flooding in low lying areas as water and ice levels dropped on the athabasca river ice accumulations were left stranded at the mouth of the clearwater river creating an ice plug at the mouth of the clearwater river the water levels on the clearwater river continued to rise even as the athabasca river water levels fell later that same day 18 15 mst a second ice run and water wave on the athabasca river again pushed ice and water up the clearwater river and was responsible for peak water levels on the clearwater river 244 944 m at 23 35 mst once the ice run and water wave passed fort mcmurray the ice at the mouth of the clearwater river pushed or melted out allowing the water to flow freely and drain the flooded areas along the clearwater river 6 2 verification of flooded areas although the ice breakup along the athabasca river occurred differently than is typically the case in the past flooding was still successfully forecasted within downtown fort mcmurray fig 19 shows two photos taken on the morning of 27 april 2018 the morning after the highest water levels were observed on the clearwater river photographs of flooded areas were not available because the peak water levels on the clearwater river were short lived and occurred at night therefore these photos show high water marks where the area had flooded and subsequently drained in the photos the previously flooded ground looks wet and dark with ponded water the high water elevation on the clearwater river 244 91 to 244 94 m correlates well with the town s lidar dem showing an accurate delineation of the areas that flooded 6 3 uncertainties in the volume of ice calculations this section demonstrates the feasibility to quantify ice volume based on ice extent extracted from modis images and ice thickness estimated from cddf and cddm for quantifying ice volume ice cover extent can be accurately quantified using high spatial resolution remote sensing images such as modis provided the contributing river reach to an ice jam formation was identified uncertainties of ice volume estimation may occur by omission of ice covers under water and spatial variations of the ice cover thickness the estimated ice thickness from the empirical relationship is more suitable for thermal ice stefan and fang 1997 although the correction on the ice thickness using in situ data improves the accuracy of the thickness of consolidated ice covers such estimation does not account for the spatial variations of ice thickness mermoz et al 2014 retrieving ice thickness from radarsat 2 images can potentially quantify spatial variations of ice thickness the estimation of ice volume may be restricted to the acquisition of winter images because during spring breakup the ice is becoming too wet for radar to penetrate the ice and the surface roughness governs the signal masking all information on the underlying ice volume e g black ice snow ice and deformed ice which includes consolidated hummocked and agglomerated ice more research is needed to further explore the potential of sar data for retrieving ice thicknesses and properties 6 4 satellite imagery a modis image was acquired of the athabasca river on 26 april 2018 at 12 30 local time shown in fig 20 the ice shown along the river is an ice run not an intact ice cover confirmed by an aerial survey in the late afternoon of the same day there is still some intact ice cover upstream of grand rapids however most of the intact ice cover between grand rapids and fort mcmurray is broken up and running towards fort mcmurray due to the coarse resolution of modis imagery it is difficult to differentiate between an intact or a stationary consolidated ice cover from running ice here the acquisition of sentinel 1 or radarsat 2 imagery would have been helpful to distinguish between the various ice cover conditions due to their much finer resolutions unfortunately the sentinel 1 satellite was not overhead this area on 26 april 2018 and there was a conflict of the radarsat 2 image acquired that day with a commercial user so that the image was not made available to us since commercial interests trump research activities it is hoped that the radarsat constellation mission rcm that is to be launched in june 2019 with its shorter revisit times will hopefully alleviate acquisition conflicts and provide more frequent retrieval of images during the breakup seasons 7 conclusions the ice jam flood forecasting and hazard mapping of the downtown area of fort mcmurray was successfully carried out for the ice cover breakup event of spring 2018 it is hoped that these research findings will advance the operational forecasting of ice related flooding which will aid preparedness and mitigation of ice jam flooding reduce flood damages and protect human life along rivers prone to major ice jam events forecasting such ice jam flood events is also needed to reduce economic damage and reduce negative impacts to society future work should also include assessments of potential financial costs by estimating property values under the risk of flooding for each forecasting scenario the volume of ice still remains the most uncertain variable in the forecasting framework due to the continually changing conditions of the ice cover during breakup more readily available radarsat images potentially in the context of the upcoming radarsat constellation mission will help provide more frequent conflict free acquisitions of this space borne imagery source this will facilitate more essential research in the future which is required to improve our characterization of river ice covers during their spring breakup declaration of competing interest the authors declare that there is no conflict of interest

6352,forecasting ice jams and their consequential flooding is more challenging than predicting open water flood conditions this is due to the chaotic nature of ice jam formation since slight changes in water and ice flows location of the ice jam toe along the river and initial water levels at the time of jam formation can lead to marked differences in the outcome of backwater level elevations and flood severity in this paper we introduce a novel operational real time flood forecasting system that captures this stochastic nature of ice jam floods and places the forecasts in a probabilistic context in the form of flood hazard maps probability of flood extents and depths this novel system was tested successfully for the ice cover breakup period in the spring of 2018 along the athabasca river at the town of fort mcmurray canada keywords operational hydrology real time flood forecasting ice jams athabasca river fort mcmurray 1 introduction floods account for the greatest number of hydrological meteorological natural disaster events in canada thistlethwaite and feltmate 2013 and for many canadian rivers the annual peak water levels are due to ice jams eccc 2013 current ice jam flood warning systems require extensive field observations have considerable uncertainty beltaos and burrell 2015 and thus lack reliability nonetheless flood forecasting and hazard mapping are urgently needed by government agencies insurance companies urban planners and developers this research strives to introduce a novel tool to forecast ice jams and assess their subsequent flood hazard in communities along northern rivers forecasting the occurrence of ice jams is challenging for several reasons the processes of ice cover breakup and ice jamming are complex and nonlinear and numerous morphological meteorological and hydrological factors interact during ice jam formation some empirical and process based attempts have been made to develop forecasting methods white 2003 2008 however these often rudimentary models perform with limited success and tend to be very site specific forecasting systems have also been attempted with artificial neural network and fuzzy logic systems sun and trevor 2015 however the physical processes underlying the cause effect relationships of ice jam formation are not considered in such approaches additionally these approaches focus on the temporal occurrence of ice jams with a weak connection to the spatial context consequently success rates for predictions with these approaches are low for instance mahabir 2008 reported that only 4 out of 7 ice jams were predicted successfully at fort mcmurray over a 25 year period some improvement approximately 20 30 is obtained when combinations of multiple models specifically adaptive neuro fuzzy inference systems artificial neural networks and multiple linear regressions are used to predict backwater level elevations sun and trevor 2018 however the computational expense may be too vast in an operational ice jam flood forecasting setting other models have been developed to predict backwater levels of ice jamming events e g river2d brayall and hicks 2012 and hec ras beltaos et al 2012 but only deterministically without considering the stochastic nature of ice jam formation and flooding only a few attempts have been made with data driven ice jam predication models to predict ice jam flooding severity e g zhao et al 2015 however most forecasting methods as the ones mentioned above generally provide only a yes no prediction to possible flood occurrences we believe that the implications of false positives or even worse false negatives assuming a positive is a flooding condition white and daly 2002 are too great and detrimental if the wrong action or no action is taken in managing a flood when decisions on such binary information are made what is required is a probabilistic forecasting approach to help manage the level of preparedness and mitigation effort exerted when resources are limited such an approach is lacking in ice jam flood forecasting forecasting ice jam floods are also more challenging than open water floods due to the chaotic nature of ice jam formation the morphology of the jams can be very dependent on the location of their formation the fluvial geomorphological setting in which they are formed the volume of ice forming the jam and the flow conditions of water and ice from upstream of the jam here we present a novel forecasting methodology in which an ice hydraulic model is placed within a stochastic framework in which an ensemble of backwater staging profiles are simulated to provide a probability of flood extents and depths in the flood hazardous region we find that probabilities of flooding represented by dynamic flood hazard maps can provide forecasters emergency responders and flood managers with essential additional information to better aid in the preparedness and mitigation of ice jam floods 2 ice jams at study site this study was conducted along an approximately 400 km long reach of the athabasca river from the town of athabasca to fort mcmurray fig 1 the athabasca river basin originates at the columbia glacier in jasper national park and flows north eastward from an elevation of 3747 m a s l down to an elevation of 187 m a s l at lake athabasca eum et al 2017 the basin with a drainage area of 1 560 000 km2 plays an important role in supporting economic development in northern alberta eum et al 2017 however ice jams form almost every year she et al 2007 and the consequent flooding poses a big threat to some areas along the river particularly in fort mcmurray s downtown area upstream of fort mcmurray a great number of rapids with sharp bends and slope changes fig 1 typically initiate a dynamic ice cover breakup kowalczyk hutchison and hicks 2007 and contribute to the formation of ice jams most years she et al 2007 in the past ice jams have been observed during the breakup period along different reaches of the river but they pose a higher flood risk at the town of fort mcmurray tfm due to the change from steep to mild river bed slope obstacles to flow islands and bars and presence of several tributaries the 1977 ice jam flooding at the tfm caused 2 6 million dollars of damage claims and the 1997 event also resulted in several millions dollars in damages mahabir et al 2006 inter annually magnitudes and timings of ice cover breakup are highly variable in the reach of the athabasca river upstream of fort mcmurray ice cover breakup in the reach is generally dynamic in a consistent pattern she et al 2007 she et al 2009 typically as air temperature increases snow melting rainfall induced border flow and or local surface runoff increase the thermal deterioration of the ice cover snowmelt in the upper basin can dramatically increase water levels and flow velocities to initiate ice sheet cracking the presence of rapids provides a basis for the formation of small ice jams with toes typically at the knick points this shifting ice produces waves that further break off thermally deteriorated intact ice covers and increases the length of smaller ice jams as ice accumulations continue to increase and the fronts of these ice jams continue to extend these small ice jams ultimately release at the knick points resulting in a sequence of ice runs the flowing ice alternatively rides up onto or submerges below the downstream intact ice covers to break them up she and hicks 2006 progressively these ice runs of released small ice jams and newly broken intact ice covers eventually form larger ice jams particularly as they approach fort mcmurray these larger ice jams usually are dislodged by the running ice of a released ice jam from further upstream 3 data and methods 3 1 modélisation environnementale communautaire surface hydrology mesh the mesh system is a semi distributed physically based land surface hydrological modelling system developed by environment and climate change canada for hydrological applications pietroniro et al 2007 it uses the canadian land surface scheme class verseghy et al 1993 to compute vertical energy and water balance for soil vegetation and snow the model s watrof module simulates lateral movement of soil and surface water to the drainage system and the watroute module provides streamflow routing through the river channels kouwen 1988 to improve computational efficiency while addressing the complexity and heterogeneity of the watershed it uses the group response unit gru approach to combine areas of similar hydrological behavior kouwen et al 1993 for large scale drainage basins this approach has been found to be appropriate due to its operational simplicity while retaining the basic physics and behavior of a distributed model pietroniro and soulis 2003 mesh has been widely used for different river basins e g davison et al 2006 haghnegahdar et al 2014 davison et al 2016 morales marín et al 2019 rokaya et al 2019 3 2 canadian precipitation analysis capa the canadian precipitation analysis capa system operationally run by the canadian meteorological centre cmc generates the regional deterministic precipitation analysis rdpa which consists of 4 daily analyses using 6 hour precipitation accumulation intervals and one daily analysis using a 24 hour precipitation accumulation interval this system covers all of north america on a 10 km grid fortin et al 2015 through statistical interpolation using cmc s regional deterministic prediction system rdps short range precipitation forecasts as the background field with surface network based rain gauge measurements satellite observations and radar derived rain rates mahfouf et al 2007 capa provides reliable estimates of precipitation over canada and has proven to be a suitable forcing product for hydrologic modeling across the country particularly regions in the mid to high latitudes with sparse gauge networks fortin et al 2014 lespinas et al 2015 a recent study by boluwade et al 2018 shows capa to be a reliable forcing input for water resources modeling and predictions 3 3 canadian global deterministic prediction system gdps the global deterministic prediction system gdps operationally run by the canadian meteorological centre cmc is a forecasting system based on the global environmental multiscale model côté et al 1998 and executed in a global configuration the data are available on a 1500 751 latitude longitude grid at a resolution of 0 24 which corresponds approximately to a 25 km resolution the model run starts twice daily 00 00 and 12 00 utc and the system generates a forecast every third hour producing a forecast over 240 h draxler et al 2015 the recent version uses a 4d ensemble variational data assimilation 4denvar system that replaces the previous 4d variational data assimilation 4dvar system which has shown to improve forecasting accuracy buehner et al 2015 note that the rdps product caron et al 2015 is also available from cmc for north america which has higher spatial resolution of approximate 10 km however the lead time available is only 48 h unlike open water forecasting where only streamflows produced by hydrological models may be adequate for flood warning ice jam forecasting requires additional inputs such as incoming ice volume estimations computation of probable stage resulting from ice jamming using river ice hydraulic models and flood inundation mapping from the computed water levels thus though coarser gdps was selected as it would provide adequate lead time for other river ice hydraulic assessments 3 4 rivice the river ice hydraulics were simulated using the one dimensional hydrodynamic model rivice the model was run in wide jam mode in which the thickening of the ice jam is induced by the shoving of ice in the jam due to the increased forces from the flow of the water against the ice jam front thrust and the underside of the ice jam cover drag and the weight of the ice accumulation in the jam weight vector in slope direction these forces are countered by the shear forces of the ice cover against the river banks friction and the support of the ice accumulation due to its thickening ice volume internal resistance more detailed descriptions of the model can be found elsewhere e g eccc 2013 lindenschmidt 2017a sheikholeslami et al 2017 ranges of the parameters associated with this balance of forces have already been calibrated and validated for a number of ice jam events along different river systems lindenschmidt 2017a 2017b 4 forecasting system setup an integrated forecasting setup consisting of all models input data sources outputs from each models and their inter linkages is provided in fig 2 each individual model setup is discussed in the next sections 4 1 mesh setup and calibration greenkenue canadian hydraulics centre 2010 an advanced data preparation analysis and visualization tool was used to prepare the drainage database for this a digital elevation model was retrieved from the canadian digital elevation data though geogratis http geogratis gc ca whereas land use data and soil data were obtained from the natural resource canada and soil data from the soil landscapes of canada respectively the model was setup with a spatial resolution of 0 125 resulting in 1326 grid cells with a drainage area of 132 057 km2 and the outlet at the athabasca river below mcmurray 07da001 mesh requires seven meteorological input files i e precipitation air temperature wind speed barometric pressure specific humidity incoming longwave radiation and incoming shortwave radiation precipitation data was obtained from capa the remaining forcing files were obtained from the global environmental model gem numerical weather prediction model côté et al 1998 that is available at spatial and temporal resolutions of 15 km and 1 h respectively the calibration process was performed using ostrich which is an open source auto calibration and multi algorithm parameter optimization software matott 2005 eight parameters of four dominant grus were calibrated although mesh was run at a three hourly time step output streamflows were generated at a daily scale for comparison and analysis the model was first calibrated for the 2002 2008 period using the nash and sutcliffe efficiency ns and its logarithmic value logns as objective functions the year 2002 was considered a spin up period and the remaining six years were used for the calibration period then the model was validated using an additional subsequent six years 2009 2014 fig 3 shows the results of the mesh calibration and validation for gauging station athabasca river below mcmurray 07da001 with simulated flows having good agreement with measured flows recorded at the gauging station the ns value of 0 68 log ns value of 0 65 and pbias of 6 8 were achieved for the calibration years whereas for the validation years a ns value of 0 66 log ns value of 0 68 and pbias of 6 9 were obtained it is also important to note that hydrological models are subject to different sources of uncertainties firstly the athabasca river basin is characterized by both climatic diverseness and spatial variability in the hydrologic processes due to its dominant physiographic heterogeneity eum et al 2014 modelling large scale northern river basins still remains a great challenge due to limited data parametric uncertainty biondi and de luca 2017 and complexity of snow processes that are difficult to capture numerically similarly some processes and their interactions such as land cover changes feedback between atmosphere and land surfaces and human interventions are not adequately represented in some physically based models debeer et al 2016 4 2 refined mesh calibration for breakup season in the second step the calibrated and validated model parameters were further fine tuned for three ice cover and breakup seasons i e the winters of 2015 2016 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 only the streamflow from 1 october to 31 may were input to the model so as to simulate under ice flow accurately fig 4 shows the model results compared with both observed flows available from the water survey of canada wsc as well as under ice flow measurements from field observations these observations are usually performed three times per winter by wsc to determine the amount of shift required of the open water rating curve to correct for under ice flows the results show that the model is able to simulate under ice flow well this approach of using an ice rating curve for mesh calibration should be considered as a first step in this proof of concept project we understand that ice conditions can vary from year to year e g juxtaposed versus consolidated and ice roughness can change over a season especially for a consolidated ice cover if more years of data were made available the mesh calibration can be improved by using only the directly measured discharge data from a longer time period however the uncertainty in discharge inferred by the ice rating curve is minimal see fig 5 and could be incorporated into the distributions of discharges used in the monte carlo simulations 4 3 rivice setup and calibration detailed descriptions of the calibration and validation of the rivice model adapted to the athabasca river is provided elsewhere see lindenschmidt 2017a 2017b the left panel of fig 6 shows a backwater profile along the athabasca river simulated for the 1977 ice jam event along the athabasca river the water level profile was extrapolated into the floodplain in which fort mcmurray s downtown area is situated to determine flood depth and extents as shown in the right panel of fig 6 good agreement resulted between aerial photographs and the simulated flood extents since the downtown area of fort mcmurray is situated along the lower clearwater river the backwater level attained at the athabasca clearwater river confluence serves as the floodwater level previous hydraulic modelling exercises of the clearwater river have shown that the backwater profile along the clearwater river especially for floods more extreme than the 1 10 year annual exceedance probability aep for that river are near horizontal see fig 7 for the 1977 flood event which approximates a 1 80 aep this suggests the water level at the clearwater river s mouth athabasca clearwater river confluence which also serves as the downstream boundary condition for the clearwater river hydraulic model has a high sensitivity on backwater staging which far exceeds the sensitivity of any parameters or other boundary condition values 4 4 stochastic modelling framework once the parameters of the river ice hydraulic model of the athabasca river were calibrated deterministically the frequency distributions of the boundary conditions i e values of inflowing ice vice and the downstream water level elevation w were calibrated stochastically by comparing the stage frequency distribution of simulated water levels at the gauge location with the stage frequency distribution of the observed water levels recorded at the gauge in the calibration framework the values for both boundary conditions and model parameters are randomly extracted from either uniform pdf or extreme value pdf when a priori knowledge of a pdf shape is not known such as the location of the toe of the ice jam or model parameters a uniform pdf is used upper and lower ranges which constrain the uniform distribution are based on available information from previous studies observational records or typical values available from the literature when extreme value data are available to construct their pdfs such as discharge and water levels an extreme value distribution is used ensembles of water level profiles are simulated within a monte carlo framework using model independent parameter estimation doherty 1994 an industry standard software package for parameter estimation and uncertainty analysis of complex environmental and other computer models this framework allows simulations to be automatically repeated so that hydraulic models can be run hundreds of times using a different set of parameters and boundary conditions for each simulation unlike conventional calibration approaches of using single values or time series such as discharge or stages to measure simulation performance we adopt stage frequency distributions sfd as an objective function for model calibration using sfd as an objective function is a novel approach and offers an effective means of calibrating parameters and boundary conditions of stochastic processes such as ice jamming lindenschmidt 2017b simulated sfds are generated from water level elevations extracted from the simulated water level profiles at a location of interest such as a gauging station where data is available for comparison the extreme value distribution parameters such as scale and location are adjusted until the simulated sfd matches the observed sfd this process can be repeated many times to produce an envelope of simulated sfds firstly the stage frequency distribution of the downstream boundary condition w was calibrated referring to fig 8 estimated flows recorded at the end of breakup from many years when the last b flag is recorded were collated to construct extreme flow frequency distributions depicted in fig 8 a as a histogram the b flag which is provided by the water survey of canada along with hydrometric data denotes ice induced backwater effects due to the presence of ice at or immediately downstream of the gauge in the river the extreme value distribution of the downstream water level fig 8 b at the model s most downstream boundary of the model domain was calibrated by adjusting the distribution s statistical parameters location and scale until the stage frequency distribution fig 8 e from an ensemble of simulated backwater levels at the athabasca gauge fig 8 d coincided with the frequency distributions of observed stage at the end of all breakup periods fig 8 f for this stochastic calibration the frequency distribution of the volume of ice is assumed to be zero fig 8 c since a condition of the end of the ice cover breakup is that the ice cover at the gauge has been flushed out downstream along the river all parameter values not shown in fig 8 are given a uniform distribution within a range between minimum and maximum values secondly now referring to fig 9 with the downstream water level boundary condition distribution in place fig 9 bb the stochastic modelling process is repeated to calibrate the frequency distribution of the inflowing volume of ice vice fig 9 cc the frequency distribution of the ice jam flows fig 9 aa which is very similarly shaped as the end of breakup flow frequency distribution is used as input the statistical parameters of location and scale for vice fig 9 cc are adjusted until the stage frequency distribution fig 9 ee assembled from the backwater stage elevations simulated at the athabasca gauge chainage fig 9 dd coincides with the frequency distribution of the instantaneous maximum stages recorded at the gauge during ice jam events fig 9 ff the resulting histogram of vice provided in fig 10 is used for the forecasting operations notice that the distribution has a maximum of approximately 19 million m3 of ice 4 5 ice volume estimations the volume of ice along the athabasca river upstream of fort mcmurray is an important variable to determine since the ice volume estimates from ice cover extents are important input to the stochastic modelling framework before such estimates can be calculated we first need to determine the ice types roughly categorised into thermal smooth black and consolidated rough white ice consolidated ice covers are generally thicker than thermal ice covers ice cover types were visually identified from radarsat 2 sq16w image acquired on 18 february 2018 see fig 11 ice covers developed by february generally remain unchanged until ice break up the figure shows most of the athabasca river upstream of the bridges having a bright high backscatter signal ice cover appears white in the image and represents the consolidated ice that typically forms along the river at freeze up this reach has a number of rapids which is conducive to frazil ice generation long into the onset of winter and the formation of consolidated ice covers the lighter low backscatter signal ice cover appears purple in the image represents thermal ice covers that would have formed along stretches with more backwater staging at freeze up for water velocities to have become slow enough to form smooth thermal ice once the ice types have been established their thicknesses can be determined ice thicknesses along with the ice cover width and lengths along the reach help estimate the volume of ice of a particular river stretch of interest thermal ice thicknesses h were quantified using the empirical relationship of ice thickening via the cumulative degree days of freezing cddf and ice ablation via the cumulative degree days of melting cddm stefan and fang 1997 zhang et al 2017 1 h α cddf c d d m b where α is a slope and b is an intercept cddf and cddm can be obtained by 2 cddf i d 1 d n t d i 3 cddm i d 1 d n t d i 5 where d1 is starting day for calculating cddf and cddm t is the mean air temperature below 0 c d1 is either the first day of november or the first day of march depending if respectively the cddf or cddm is being calculated when calculating cddm 5 c is added to compensate for the contribution of solar radiation to ice melting zhang et al 2017 daily air temperature data used for computing cddf and cddm were recorded at the fort mcmurray weather station 56 39 04 n 111 12 48 w the thickness of consolidated ice hcon is generally thicker than thermal ice h and was determined by multiplying thermal ice thicknesses with a multiplier m 4 h con h m multipliers are derived from measurements of consolidated ice thickness in the field and comparing them with thermal ice thicknesses at the athabasca gauge thermal ice measurements at the end of march 2018 averaged 0 71 m one consolidated ice measurement yielded a thickness of 0 97 from these two values a multiplier of approximately 1 4 0 97 0 71 was determined ice thickness of consolidated ice was corrected by applying this multiplier to the estimated thermal ice thickness this is similar to other multiplier values determined from consolidated and thermal ice measurements in other years for example m was calculated to be equal to 1 6 from ice thickness measurements carried out in the spring of 2003 hicks and pelletier 2003 5 real time forecasting operations complementing the following text on the methodology of forecasting operations fig 12 depicts the steps taken to forecast ice jam flood hazard forecasting began on 20 april 2018 for the period 21 30 april 2018 when the cumulative degree days of melting cddm was approaching the minimum cddf 113 c days when breakup occurred in the past cddm 137 c days 5 1 mesh 10 day flow forecasts a 10 day forecast of meteorological data was provided by gdps fig 12 i this forecast allowed us to simulate forecasted flows along the athabasca river upstream of the bridges and the clearwater river using the mesh model fig 12 ii referring to fig 13 capa and rdps data was first used to hindcast the previous day s flows and determine all state variables that were saved to be used as initial conditions to drive the next 10 day flow forecast using the gdps data the model simulations and the processing of the data and results were automated and repeated every day to obtain daily flow forecasts always for the next 10 days mesh was run at an hourly time step in hindcasting mode whereas 3 hourly simulations were performed in forecasting mode matching the temporal resolution of the meteorological forcing data the minimum and maximum discharges of a 10 day flow forecast were extracted fig 12 ii and only randomized flows from the flow frequency distribution within the range between the minimum and maximum values fig 12 iii were selected for the monte carlo simulations fig 12 iv 5 2 downstream water level elevation for each forecast a downstream water level elevation was required for the day the forecast was made fig 12 v the probability of the water level elevation recorded at the athabasca gauge was determined from which the corresponding water level elevation at the downstream model boundary was determined fig 12 vi this value established the minimum of the range within the stage frequency distribution fig 12 vii from which random values were extracted for the monte carlo simulations fig 12 iv 5 3 volume of ice estimates the extent of the ice cover was monitored fig 12 viii using modis satellite imagery and aerial surveys of the river if the ice cover was still mostly intact along the upper athabasca river fig 12 ix the full frequency distribution of the volume of ice fig 12 x was used for the monte carlo simulations fig 12 iv if the ice cover was broken up in parts creating open water sections only the volume of ice within the ice cover upstream of fort mcmurray was considered fig 12 ix this volume corresponds to a maximum value within the frequency distribution and only random values within the range up to the maximum fig 12 x were used for the monte carlo simulations fig 12 iv we assumed that the ice that is broken up is either ablated stranded along the shore embedded within shear walls along the river edges or accumulated in the front of the downstream ice cover hence the extent of the ice cover upstream of fort mcmurray may consist of both intact ice and accumulated ice rubble on 24 april 2018 the ice cover along the athabasca river upstream of fort mcmurray was generally intact fig 14 aerial photography confirm that this state of the ice cover remained the same for most of the river on 25 april 2018 hence justifying the use of the full frequency distribution of the volume of ice on 26 april 2018 the ice cover quickly broke up upstream of grand rapids and ran past fort mcmurray hence no further forecasting operations were required 5 4 backwater level calculation once the ranges to constrain the frequency distributions of flow downstream water level elevation and volume of ice were established monte carlo simulations were carried out fig 12 iv that yielded an ensemble of backwater levels fig 12 xi also see fig 15 the water level elevations at the mouth of clearwater river were used to construct flood inundation and extent maps for each simulated water level fig 12 xii the maps were then sorted in ascending order of the number of flooded cells or total flood depths to determine deciles of flood extent and flood depths respectively 5 5 probability of flood inundation extent the monte carlo simulations provided a hundred ice jam water level profiles from which the water levels at the confluence of athabasca river and snye channel were extracted to derive flood extents in the downtown part of fort mcmurray fig 12 xii the study extracted the water levels at the snye channel because the water level at this location provides a more conservative representation of the flood hazard areas in the downtown area each water level was subtracted from the terrain elevation determined from a lidar digital elevation model dem to calculate flood depths to construct the flood depth maps the water surface raster models were interpolated to the cell size of the lidar dem 15 15 m flood extent areas were then determined by estimating the number of flooded cells in the flood depth maps the probability of flooding in this study is defined as the number of times as a percentage the area cell in the flood map can be flooded from the total simulated ice jam water level profiles the study generated hundreds of ice jam water level profiles in the monte carlo framework everyday based on the forecasted range of the boundary value distributions gis tools translated water levels extracted from the profiles at the snye channel chainage to flood probability maps for each map each cell was assigned a 0 if the flood depth was less than 0 and 1 if the flood depth was greater than 0 the relative total number of times each cell had the value 1 determined the probability of that cell of being flooded 5 probability o f f l o o d i n g o f e a c h c e l l number o f t i m e s t h e c e l

6 which is a reflection of the increased flows forecasted by mesh fig 13 the maximum predicted flow from the sixth 10 day forecast was approximately 1100 m3 s to recap fig 17 is derived from fig 12 with real values showing the steps taken exemplarily for forecast 1 first the mesh forecasted discharges were simulated using 10 day forecasted meteorological data fig 17 α the minimum and maximum values of the 10 day flow series are used to constrain the frequency distribution of the breakup discharges fig 17 β only random values from within the minimum maximum range were extracted for the monte carlo simulations fig 17 η the water level at the athabasca river gauge is tracked fig 17 γ and is shifted downward to yield a minimum value of the frequency distribution of the most downstream water level elevations used as the downstream boundary conditions in rivice fig 17 δ downstream water levels are randomly selected from the distribution greater than the minimum value for the monte carlo simulations fig 17 η satellite imagery or airborne photography were used to determine the extent of the ice cover upstream of fort mcmurray fig 17 ε in this example the ice cover is still continuously intact hence the full frequency distribution of the volume of ice is used fig 17 ζ in the monte carlo simulations fig 17 η the monte carlo simulations yield n e g n 100 water level profiles fig 17 θ water level elevations from each profile at the athabasca clearwater river confluence are extracted to produce flood extent maps within the fort mcmurray downtown area counting how many times each dem grid cell in the floodplain is flooded m from all n simulations provides a probability p of flooding for each cell p m n fig 17 ι 6 discussion 6 1 2018 breakup chronology at fort mcmurray in most years it is the formation of a stationary ice jam on the athabasca river at fort mcmurray that causes high water levels on the clearwater river and possible flooding of the town site however in 2018 the ice cover broke up at fort mcmurray and high water levels occurred without the formation of a stationary ice jam this is an atypical breakup pattern for the ice cover at fort mcmurray the onset of breakup occurred at approximately 11 00 mountain standard time mst on 26 april 2018 when a large water wave and ice run pushed the ice cover in fort mcmurray breaking it up and causing high water levels the highest top of ice elevation measured at the highway 63 bridges was 245 412 m see fig 18 these high water and ice levels lasted for approximately 1 5 h as the wave pushed through town on the athabasca river at the same time ice and water from the athabasca river were pushed up the clearwater river breaking the intact ice cover and raising water levels sufficiently to cause flooding in low lying areas as water and ice levels dropped on the athabasca river ice accumulations were left stranded at the mouth of the clearwater river creating an ice plug at the mouth of the clearwater river the water levels on the clearwater river continued to rise even as the athabasca river water levels fell later that same day 18 15 mst a second ice run and water wave on the athabasca river again pushed ice and water up the clearwater river and was responsible for peak water levels on the clearwater river 244 944 m at 23 35 mst once the ice run and water wave passed fort mcmurray the ice at the mouth of the clearwater river pushed or melted out allowing the water to flow freely and drain the flooded areas along the clearwater river 6 2 verification of flooded areas although the ice breakup along the athabasca river occurred differently than is typically the case in the past flooding was still successfully forecasted within downtown fort mcmurray fig 19 shows two photos taken on the morning of 27 april 2018 the morning after the highest water levels were observed on the clearwater river photographs of flooded areas were not available because the peak water levels on the clearwater river were short lived and occurred at night therefore these photos show high water marks where the area had flooded and subsequently drained in the photos the previously flooded ground looks wet and dark with ponded water the high water elevation on the clearwater river 244 91 to 244 94 m correlates well with the town s lidar dem showing an accurate delineation of the areas that flooded 6 3 uncertainties in the volume of ice calculations this section demonstrates the feasibility to quantify ice volume based on ice extent extracted from modis images and ice thickness estimated from cddf and cddm for quantifying ice volume ice cover extent can be accurately quantified using high spatial resolution remote sensing images such as modis provided the contributing river reach to an ice jam formation was identified uncertainties of ice volume estimation may occur by omission of ice covers under water and spatial variations of the ice cover thickness the estimated ice thickness from the empirical relationship is more suitable for thermal ice stefan and fang 1997 although the correction on the ice thickness using in situ data improves the accuracy of the thickness of consolidated ice covers such estimation does not account for the spatial variations of ice thickness mermoz et al 2014 retrieving ice thickness from radarsat 2 images can potentially quantify spatial variations of ice thickness the estimation of ice volume may be restricted to the acquisition of winter images because during spring breakup the ice is becoming too wet for radar to penetrate the ice and the surface roughness governs the signal masking all information on the underlying ice volume e g black ice snow ice and deformed ice which includes consolidated hummocked and agglomerated ice more research is needed to further explore the potential of sar data for retrieving ice thicknesses and properties 6 4 satellite imagery a modis image was acquired of the athabasca river on 26 april 2018 at 12 30 local time shown in fig 20 the ice shown along the river is an ice run not an intact ice cover confirmed by an aerial survey in the late afternoon of the same day there is still some intact ice cover upstream of grand rapids however most of the intact ice cover between grand rapids and fort mcmurray is broken up and running towards fort mcmurray due to the coarse resolution of modis imagery it is difficult to differentiate between an intact or a stationary consolidated ice cover from running ice here the acquisition of sentinel 1 or radarsat 2 imagery would have been helpful to distinguish between the various ice cover conditions due to their much finer resolutions unfortunately the sentinel 1 satellite was not overhead this area on 26 april 2018 and there was a conflict of the radarsat 2 image acquired that day with a commercial user so that the image was not made available to us since commercial interests trump research activities it is hoped that the radarsat constellation mission rcm that is to be launched in june 2019 with its shorter revisit times will hopefully alleviate acquisition conflicts and provide more frequent retrieval of images during the breakup seasons 7 conclusions the ice jam flood forecasting and hazard mapping of the downtown area of fort mcmurray was successfully carried out for the ice cover breakup event of spring 2018 it is hoped that these research findings will advance the operational forecasting of ice related flooding which will aid preparedness and mitigation of ice jam flooding reduce flood damages and protect human life along rivers prone to major ice jam events forecasting such ice jam flood events is also needed to reduce economic damage and reduce negative impacts to society future work should also include assessments of potential financial costs by estimating property values under the risk of flooding for each forecasting scenario the volume of ice still remains the most uncertain variable in the forecasting framework due to the continually changing conditions of the ice cover during breakup more readily available radarsat images potentially in the context of the upcoming radarsat constellation mission will help provide more frequent conflict free acquisitions of this space borne imagery source this will facilitate more essential research in the future which is required to improve our characterization of river ice covers during their spring breakup declaration of competing interest the authors declare that there is no conflict of interest

6353,soil compaction during post fire logging can increase runoff and erosion increasing surface cover is an effective way to reduce erosion but this has not been tested on soils impacted by both fire and compaction we measured the effects of compaction bulk density of 0 9 or 1 1 g cm 3 and surface cover 0 or 60 using bark mulch or logging slash compacted only on runoff leaching and erosion four 0 5 m2 plots per treatment were filled with burned soil and inclined to 18 two 30 min simulated rainfall events with 72 mm h 1 intensity and one concentrated flow event were applied to each plot the runoff from the dry and wet runs totaled 32 mm in the uncompacted bare plots and the value was not significantly different for the compacted bare plots any of the mulch plots or the compacted slash plots leaching was higher for the uncompacted bare plots 7 mm than for the compacted bare plots 1 mm and mulch or slash did not affect leaching the uncompacted bare plots produced 38 g of rainsplash and 497 g m 2 of sheetwash and these were about half the values for the compacted bare plots mulching strongly reduced the rainsplash and sheetwash for both the uncompacted 10 g and 184 g m 2 respectively and compacted conditions 19 g and 431 g m 2 respectively although the difference in sheetwash was only significant for the uncompacted plots slash also reduced rainsplash 19 g relative to the compacted bare plots 74 g but did not affect sheetwash concentrated flow produced 858 g m 2 of rilling from the uncompacted bare plots which was greater than the compacted plots 237 g m 2 mulching reduced rilling by 95 in the uncompacted plots and 78 in the compacted plots but slash did not reduce rilling the reductions in rainsplash erosion caused by the mulch and slash were attributed to the increase in surface cover which reduced the energy imparted to the soil by the rainfall the mulch with its high degree of contact with the soil also reduced particle detachment and transport by overland flow in contrast the slash did not have complete contact with the soil surface and did not affect sheetwash or rilling compaction and the type of material used to increase surface cover are important factors to consider when assessing potential impacts of logging on runoff and sediment delivery from burned soils keywords mulch runoff sheetwash soil moisture salvage logging 1 introduction runoff and soil erosion can increase substantially after wildfires especially in severely burned areas benavides solorio and macdonald 2001 2005 moody et al 2013 these increases have been associated with negative on site and off site effects such as soil fertility losses shakesby 2011 stream water pollution emelko et al 2011 lewis et al 2018 and sedimentation shakesby 2011 robichaud et al 2016 soil compaction by machinery used during post fire logging activities has been shown to affect soil roughness bulk density and shear strength and it can increase post fire runoff and erosion croke et al 1999a b 2001 mciver and mcneil 2006 silins et al 2009 emelko et al 2011 which may greatly exacerbate the detrimental effects of the wildfire itself some post fire field studies have shown that unlogged areas exhibited lower runoff and erosion volumes as compared to soils impacted by logging equipment wagenbrenner et al 2015 2016 malvar et al 2017 in contrast other experiments have shown that compaction or disturbance related to post fire logging led to lower soil erosion rates adekalu et al 2006 ekwe and harrilal 2010 james and krumland 2018 soil surface cover such as litter stones char ash and vegetation cover are known to inhibit surface runoff arnau rosalén et al 2008 ruiz sinoga and martinez murillo 2009 prats et al 2017 2018 and soil erosion de figueiredo and poesen 1998 cerdà and doerr 2005 prats et al 2012 but the effects of added cover on runoff and erosion from burned and compacted soils are not well understood post fire soil erosion rates have been directly linked to low ground cover rates larsen et al 2009 and mulch application rates have been determined for several materials for agriculture smets et al 2008 post fire hillslopes robichaud et al 2010b and roads burroughs and king 1989 it is widely assumed that mulching at rates above 60 ground cover can significantly reduce soil erosion burroughs and king 1989 robichaud et al 2000 smets et al 2008 robichaud et al 2010b moody et al 2013 different materials can be used as mulches and the main differences among mulch materials relate to density application rate and resistance to physical degradation on the ground surface application rates ranged from 1 to 11 mg ha 1 with straw and forest residue mulches for post fire unlogged environments robichaud et al 2010b prats et al 2016 while slash application rates for reducing soil erosion in skidder compacted soils can be more than 10 times higher 28 165 mg ha 1 cambi et al 2015 jourgholami and abari 2017 because of its larger particle size slash is not always effective in reducing erosion from surface runoff for example wagenbrenner et al 2016 found that manually adding harvest residues to attain at least 50 cover on skidder compacted soils resulting from post fire salvage logging did not affect sediment flux rates the researchers also suggest that specific best management practices are needed to mitigate the hydrologic impacts of post fire salvage logging besides ground cover other factors such as soil properties soil moisture soil texture slope angle skidder characteristics ground pressure and rainfall characteristics such as rainfall intensity cambi et al 2015 can have important roles in soil erosion in spite of a number of studies assessing the mitigation of post fire soil erosion with mulching e g bautista et al 1996 wagenbrenner et al 2006 robichaud et al 2010b fernandez et al 2011 robichaud et al 2013a prats et al 2016 very little is known about the reasons why mulch is a relatively effective treatment mulch seems to be effective due to three components i increasing interception of raindrops and associated reduction in rain splash detachment ii reducing soil surface sealing and crusting which thereby increases infiltration and reduces surface runoff rates bautista et al 1996 and iii increased surface roughness and obstruction of overland flow that results in lower soil detachment by sheetflow and rilling pannkuk and robichaud 2003 giménez and govers 2008 the increase in surface roughness by mulch promoted infiltration and lowered runoff velocities in areas treated with mulch and this reduced sediment transport robichaud et al 2013c foltz and wagenbrenner 2010 observed that overland flow is often temporarily stored upslope of mini debris dams that form when strands of mulch and litter interlock and these small ephemeral ponds may increase infiltration however it is difficult to determine the proportion of erosion reduction that can be attributed to protecting the soil from raindrop impact as opposed to slowing overland flow velocity or increasing detention storage robichaud et al 2013c in general the mulch success is often attributed to the increase in ground cover without identification of a specific process change it has been very difficult to isolate the runoff i e saturation excess vs infiltration excess and erosion mechanisms i e splash sheetwash or rill for example flanagan and nearing 1995 described sheetwash or interrill erosion as the combination of soil detachment resulting from the impact of water drops directly on soil particles rainsplash and the associated transport of the detached particles by shallow overland flow sheetwash most of the past laboratory research studied combinations of processes such as splash and sheetwash de figueiredo and poesen 1998 only sheetwash foltz et al 2009 sheetwash and rill erosion foltz and wagenbrenner 2010 sheetwash and rill erosion croke et al 2001 there have been more studies addressing solely rill erosion nearing et al 1999 robichaud et al 2010a wagenbrenner et al 2010 wagenbrenner et al 2016 but studies independently assessing each of the three mechanisms are generally lacking understanding the relative magnitudes of splash sheetwash and rill erosion on total soil losses will help us to determine the mechanism s affected by mulch that lead to reductions in erosion and also help refine specific measures for post fire management scenarios the main aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of compaction and the presence and type of ground cover on post fire runoff and soil erosion our specific objectives were to 1 determine if soil compaction affects hydrologic responses runoff leaching soil moisture and runoff timing 2 determine the effects of compaction on rainsplash sheetwash and rill erosion and 3 determine if adding sequoia bark strand mulch or logging slash changes these hydrologic or erosional responses we used laboratory rainfall and flow simulations to isolate each hydrologic and erosion processes 2 materials and methods the effects of two levels of soil compaction uncompacted and compacted and two levels of ground cover 0 and 60 sequoia bark mulch cover on runoff leaching soil moisture runoff timing rainsplash sheetwash and rilling were tested with a rainfall simulator the 60 cover rate was chosen as it is generally considered the minimum amount of cover for erosion control in different environments smets et al 2008 robichaud et al 2010b burroughs and king 1989 and widely used as a coverage target in operational post fire mulching the study used a replicated full factorial completely randomized design with four replications of the four combinations of the two factors treatments a fifth treatment with compacted soil and 60 cover of logging slash was also included the plot preparation and subsequent simulations were randomly ordered among the treatments the simulations were done indoors in mckinleyville california usa between january and april 2017 each simulation was comprised of three parts dry wet and flow in order to test the responses of the treatments under different antecedent soil moisture dry and wet and to test the treatments under rill initiation flow splash erosion was also measured during the dry and wet runs 2 1 plot preparation soil was collected from the boggs mountain demonstration state forest bmdsf located in north central california 38 81443 n 122 67339 w which was burned by the valley fire in 2015 a separate research project assessing hydrologic and erosional responses to post fire forest management was underway at this location and several experiments are still ongoing as part of the ongoing experiments soil bulk density was measured using a bulk density sampler with a 5 5 cm cylindrical core in uncompacted areas and in areas where skidder traffic had caused compaction bulk density at 0 5 cm soil depth was 0 76 0 08 g cm 3 mean standard deviation n 13 in the uncompacted soil and 0 96 0 05 g cm 3 in the compacted soil n 13 indicating an increase in bulk density from the skidder traffic of 26 the soil for the simulations was gathered from a hillslope burned at high severity 1100 m a s l and a steepness of 12 where no equipment had passed since the fire these soils were deep well drained formed from igneous rocks and exhibited andic soil properties edinger marshall et al 2016 the soil corresponded to the whispering series loamy skeletal mixed mesic ultic haploxeralfs soil survey staff 2003 stones larger than 8 mm diameter constituted 15 4 of the bulk soil mass gravel 2 to 8 mm was 19 8 sand was 47 2 and silt and clay made up 17 6 of the mass soil organic matter determined by loss on ignition from 15 replicates 550 c at 4 h was very high 0 182 g g 1 in preparation for the rainfall simulations stones and gravel greater than 6 3 mm were removed by sieving resulting in a gravelly sandy loam texture with a gravel content of 17 steel square plots 70 cm wide by 70 cm long 0 49 m2 and 15 cm deep had a 1 cm metal grid bottom that we covered with a porous geotextile fabric that allowed water to permeate this water was funneled to a hose for the measurement of the leaching volume fig 1 the plots were gently filled with uncompacted air dried soil a single pass of a straight edged blade was used to produce a flat surface with a uniform soil depth as confirmed with a rigid steel needle inserted in the soil at 6 locations table 1 the downslope edge of the plot consisted of a metal lip at a height of 5 cm which corresponded to the top of the soil fig 1 this lip was connected to a detachable gutter where surface runoff was funneled to a hose for collection robichaud et al 2016 mean bulk density for the uncompacted soil in the laboratory was higher than measured in the field and this was attributed to the absence of large aggregates which were destroyed by sieving before plot preparation for the compacted treatment additional dry soil was added to the plot table 1 and the soil was compacted with a 5 kg hammer to a plate that covered the full plot during roughly 1 h the dry soil was compacted to a similar soil depth and resulted in a bulk density that was 20 higher than the uncompacted condition three soil cores were used to sample bulk density and soil moisture within each plot table 1 and the three holes were gently refilled with a proportional amount of soil some plots were discarded if the bulk density was greater than 0 91 g cm 3 in the uncompacted treatment or lower than 1 04 g cm 3 in the compacted treatment after carrying out the simulations another three bulk density samples were gathered in areas undisturbed by the flow run and these samples were also used to measure gravimetric soil moisture all bulk density samples were dried at 105 c for 24 h astm 2007 a soil moisture sensor ech2o 5 tm meter group pullman wa was installed at 3 cm depth in the lower left corner of the plot a handheld read out device stored soil moisture every minute during the simulations and for 5 min after rainfall stopped initial and final soil moisture for each run was also recorded for statistical analysis sequoia sequoia sempervirens d don endl bark shreds and strands were sieved through a 4 cm screen to remove the smaller portion foltz and wagenbrenner 2010 prats et al 2017 dried at 105 c for 24 h and applied at a rate of 200 g m 2 to the mulched plots to obtain a target surface cover of 60 cover table 1 for the slash plots logging slash was gathered from bmdsf after wildfire and logging activities and was composed of either ponderosa pine pinus ponderosa douglas ex c lawson or douglas fir pseudotsuga menziesii mirb franco stems and branches of 1 9 0 6 cm diameter and 34 1 10 6 cm length oven dried slash was applied by hand at a rate of 3400 g m 2 to each slash treated plot to achieve the nominal target of 60 cover table 1 actual mulch or slash cover was measured with point counts on a 5 cm grid and material was added or removed to achieve the target cover amount table 1 we measured the saturated water retention capacity of the mulch and slash by subtracting the oven dried mass 105 c 24 h from the saturated mass yielding an average water retention capacity of 2 6 0 4 g water per g of mulch and 1 4 0 3 g water per g of slash 2 2 rainfall and inflow simulations a portable purdue type rainfall simulator bertrand and parr 1961 with a single oscillating veejet 80 100 s s co h3 8u pressurized nozzle spraying systems co wheaton il was set at 3 m above the center of the plot this oscillating arm rainfall simulator was designed and fabricated at the usda forest service rocky mountain research station following similar designs paige et al 2003 the water pressure was set at 55 kpa which produced an initial velocity of approximately 8 8 m s 1 meyer and harmon 1979 which closely approximated the terminal velocity of natural raindrops of this size van dijk et al 2002 and produced an impact kinetic energy of 271 kj ha 1 mm 1 paige et al 2003 the rainfall intensity was set by the number of oscillations which was controlled with a small fixed speed motor and a solenoid norton and savabi 2010 we achieved a rainfall intensity of 72 1 5 mm h 1 using a run time of 97 rainfall of this intensity over a 30 minute duration would occur on average less than every 100 years at bmdsf but this high application rate assured the rainfall rate exceeded the infiltration capacity of the soil and assured surface runoff from each treatment foltz and wagenbrenner 2010 and the rate was on the low end of the range of intensities used in other post fire rainfall simulation studies robichaud et al 2016 the plot was inclined to 18 to simulate the average slope of the bmdsf study sites and centered below the nozzle fig 1 prior to each dry run the rainfall rate was tested and the applied rainfall was collected in a calibration pan that covered the top of the plot frame three to five 1 minute samples were collected from the outlet of the calibration pan and weighed with a portable scale if necessary the nozzle run time was adjusted to achieve the target rainfall intensity rainfall splashed material was collected along the downslope end of the plot for each dry and wet run using a 60 cm by a 40 cm piece of geotextile the skaps gt 140 needle punched nonwoven geotextile fabric was porous 136 g m 2 skaps inc athens ga usa allowing water to permeate and retaining sediments larger than the 0 21 mm opening sizes prior to installation the splash fabric pieces were numbered dried 105 c 24 h and weighed the fabric was secured to the plot frame at the outlet 2 cm above the soil surface with clips and wood posts forming a 70 cm wide 20 cm high and 20 cm deep splash collector above the detachable gutter fig 1 de figueiredo and poesen 1998 the splash fabric collected rain splashed material coming from the upslope direction while surface runoff passed beneath the fabric to the gutter and funnel after 30 min of rainfall on the dry soil dry run the simulation was interrupted for approximately 1 h during this break the splash fabric was removed and stored in a pan the sediment deposited in the gutter was removed and stored in a separate pan a new piece of splash fabric was installed and the rainfall intensity was re calibrated the wet run was also 30 min and after the wet run we again removed and stored the splash fabric and deposited sediment approximately 1 h after the wet run ruts were simulated on the bare and mulched plots and inflow was delivered in four short pulses at the top of each plot to simulate overland flow from upslope nearing et al 1999 to simulate the ruts a small toy truck with rubber wheels was passed diagonally over the plot with uniform hand pressure in order to introduce depressions on the soil surface fig 1 these simulated ruts were not scaled to field conditions and were intended only to simulate the effects of ruts or tracks on concentrating runoff and inducing the formation of rills wagenbrenner et al 2016 the size of the wood pieces prevented introduction of the simulated ruts in the slash treated plots each pulse consisted of 1 1 l of clear water that was instantaneously gravity fed at the upslope center of the plot via a 10 cm wide flow box fig 1 the four pulses resulted in an overall flow rate of 4 3 0 8 l min 1 equivalent to a total of 10 3 0 6 mm in each flow run table 1 which was comparable to rates used in other rill experiments foltz and wagenbrenner 2010 robichaud et al 2010a prats et al 2017 2018 sediment deposited in the gutter during the flow run was also collected and stored separately from the sediment deposited during from the dry and wet runs runoff start time for the dry and wet runs was the time between the initiation of rainfall and the time when runoff at the outlet of the plot was more than 1 drop per 3 s for the flow run the start time was the period between the release of the runoff pulse and the instant when the runoff reached the bottom of the plot runoff end time was the time between the cessation of rainfall or runoff pulses and the time when runoff at the outlet of the plot was less than 1 drop per 3 s timed runoff samples were collected in separate pre labeled and pre weighed bottles each minute between the runoff start and stop times the runoff produced by each runoff pulse during the flow run was collected in a single bottle leaching for each run was the volume of water that permeated the bottom of the plot all runoff samples splash fabrics and sediment deposited in the gutter were weighed oven dried 105 c 24 h and re weighed to obtain runoff volume mm sediment concentration g l 1 splash material g and dry sediment deposited in the gutter g the deposited sediment was included in the total sediment yield g m 2 for each run runoff leaching and sheetwash and rill sediment dry weights were divided by the horizontal projection of the plot area 0 474 m2 to produce unit area runoff leaching and sediment yields respectively runoff coefficients were the runoff volumes divided by the applied rainfall or inflow volumes ratios were calculated to demonstrate the effect of compaction compacted value uncompacted value and addition of cover mulch or slash value bare value for runoff leaching splash and sediment yield 2 3 statistical analysis analyses were performed using three way mixed effects models on the response variables surface runoff leaching initial and final soil moisture runoff start time runoff end time splash sediment yield and sediment concentration in each model compaction uncompacted and compacted soils cover bare mulch and slash and run dry wet and flow were the fixed effects and plot was the random effect we also ran the same model excluding the slash treatment because it was only present on the compacted soils which resulted in two simpler mixed effects models one with two levels of compaction two levels of cover and three levels of run and another with only two levels of run dry and wet these two reduced models were constructed in order to assess the weight of compaction and cover factors on the hydrologic and the erosive response variables in balanced statistical models all interactions among fixed factors were also considered all dependent variables except runoff and final soil moisture were 4th root transformed to achieve normally distributed model residuals autoregressive variance covariance structures were selected for the mixed effects models littell et al 2006 multiple pair wise comparisons were computed on all significant treatment and interaction effects using the tukey kramer procedure kramer 1956 simple linear regressions with intercept set to the origin were calculated for splash versus sheetwash sediment yields for the dry and wet runs and similarly for the combined dry and wet run splash sediment yield versus the rill sediment yield for the flow run all the statistical assumptions used α 0 05 and all statistical analyses were carried out using sas 9 3 sas institute inc 2016 3 results 3 1 hydrologic results runoff in the dry run started after 276 s in the uncompacted bare plots as compared to 213 s for the compacted bare plots but this difference was not significant table 2 the mulch significantly delayed the onset of runoff in the uncompacted plots 487 s but mulch and slash had no significant effect in the compacted plots table 2 runoff start times consistently and significantly decreased for the wet runs 52 90 s for each treatment and there were no differences among treatments in either the wet or flow runs runoff end times averaged 189 s for the uncompacted bare dry runs and none of the other treatments had a significantly different mean runoff end time table 2 the mean runoff end time for the uncompacted bare wet runs was 175 s and this did not differ from the value from the dry run the compaction and cover treatments generally increased the wet run end time but only the compacted mulch plots produced a significantly longer end time relative to the uncompacted bare value table 2 the compacted mulch plots also had a longer mean run time for the wet run than for the dry run for the flow runs the mean end time was 177 s for the uncompacted bare plots and all of the other treatments had significantly greater runoff end times than this table 2 from the onset of runoff runoff coefficients progressively increased within each run and between runs fig 2 the runoff coefficients exceed 50 by the end of each dry run and exceeded 60 for most of each wet run and for all of the flow runs the runoff coefficient approached 100 on the flow run for the bare plots there were no significant differences in mean runoff coefficients for any run among the treatments fig 2 runoff from the uncompacted bare plots averaged 10 mm during the dry run 22 mm from the wet run and 10 mm from the flow run table 2 the mean plot total runoff for the uncompacted bare treatment 43 mm represents 54 of the water volume applied to the plot runoff volumes for all treatments increased significantly from the dry to the wet run table 2 compaction did not significantly increase the runoff for the bare plots as compared to the uncompacted bare plots in any of the runs table 2 mulching did not affect the runoff rate for any of the runs as compared to the uncompacted bare plots similarly there were no differences in runoff due to mulch or slash for a given run among the compacted plots table 2 leaching from the uncompacted bare plots averaged 1 mm in the dry run 6 mm in the wet run and 0 mm in the flow run totaling 7 mm for the simulation or 9 of the total amount of water applied to the plot table 2 soil compaction significantly decreased leaching regardless of the cover treatments and only the bare compacted plot produced any leachate table 2 the leaching from the uncompacted mulch plots was greater for each run than uncompacted bare plots and totaled 12 mm 18 but none of the apparent differences fig 3 were significant the initial soil moisture from the laboratory measurements was 7 for the uncompacted bare plots and none of the other treatments significantly varied from this table 1 the soil moisture from the sensor at 3 cm below the soil surface started at 3 for the uncompacted bare plots and the initial value for the uncompacted mulch plots was not significantly different table 2 the compacted plots all had initial soil moisture of 9 the soil moisture increased significantly for each treatment during the dry run table 2 the soil moisture in the uncompacted treatments increased for the first 20 25 min of the dry run and then leveled off the relatively rapid increase in the uncompacted plots resulted in 40 soil moisture in the uncompacted bare plots and 44 soil moisture in the uncompacted mulched plots at the end of the dry run fig 2 and these values were not significantly different table 2 the soil moisture for the uncompacted plots decreased slightly before the start of the wet run and then increased to a relatively constant value within about 5 min fig 2 and remained at or near the values measured at the end of the dry run through the rest of the simulations table 2 fig 2 in contrast the soil moisture in all the compacted treatments increased more gradually fig 2 and the compacted bare plots averaged only 22 at the end of the dry run which was significantly less than the uncompacted bare plots table 2 neither the compacted mulch nor the compacted slash plots had a different soil moisture than the compacted bare plots at the end of the dry run table 2 the gradual increase in soil moisture in the compacted plots continued through the wet run fig 2 and the increase in the soil moisture at the end of the wet run was significant for the compacted bare plots table 2 at the end of the flow run none of the treatments had a significantly different soil moisture than the uncompacted bare plots table 2 3 2 erosion results the uncompacted bare plots on average produced 21 g of splash erosion in the dry run and 17 g in the wet run table 2 the compacted bare plots produced nearly double these amounts fig 3a 42 g in the dry run and 32 g in the wet run although the differences were not significant table 2 mulching significantly reduced rainsplash in the uncompacted soils by 73 and 78 for the dry and wet runs respectively similarly the mulch and slash on the compacted soils both significantly reduced rainsplash by 72 to 79 for the dry and wet runs table 2 in all the treatments rainsplash was slightly higher on the dry run than on the wet run and the difference was significant for the compacted mulch plots the mean sediment concentration in the uncompacted bare plots was 18 g l 1 in the dry run 14 g l 1 in the wet run and 89 g l 1 in the more erosive flow run table 2 soil compaction increased sediment concentration during the dry 23 g l 1 and wet 22 g l 1 runs on the bare plots but neither of these values were significantly different than the uncompacted bare plot values table 2 in contrast the flow run of the compacted bare plots had a significantly lower sediment concentration 28 g l 1 than the comparable concentration in the uncompacted bare plots table 2 the mulch cover reduced the sediment concentrations in all runs as compared to the bare plots with comparable level of compaction and the reductions were significant in the flow run fig 2 table 2 the slash plots produced somewhat lower sediment concentrations than the compacted bare plots in the dry and wet runs but the differences were not significant table 2 the sediment concentration in the flow run of the compacted slash plots which did not have simulated ruts increased relative to the compacted bare plots but this difference also was not significant table 2 mean sediment yields for the uncompacted bare plots were 180 g m 2 for the dry run 317 g m 2 for the wet run and 858 g m 2 for the flow run table 2 soil compaction in the bare plots produced not significant increases in sediment yields despite compaction ratios for sediment yield of 1 90 and 1 77 for the dry and wet runs respectively fig 3a however the mean sediment yield in the flow run in the compacted bare plots was only 28 of the value for the uncompacted bare plots fig 3a and this was a significant decrease table 2 mulching significantly reduced sediment yields by 64 for the dry run 62 for the wet run and 95 for the flow run relative to the uncompacted bare plots table 2 fig 3b the sediment yield on the compacted mulch plots was about half the yield on the compacted bare plots for the dry and wet runs fig 3b and for the flow run the reduction was 78 fig 3b which was significant the compacted slash plots produced slightly lower sediment yields for the dry and wet runs than the compacted bare plots and greater sediment yields for the flow run where no ruts were introduced in the plots but none of these differences were significant table 2 the three factor statistical models which assessed the relative strength of compaction mulch cover and run indicate that compaction was a stronger control for the hydrologic variables of runoff leaching and soil moisture while cover exhibited a stronger control on runoff start and end times table 3 the f values for all the hydrologic variables except for runoff start and end times decreased slightly when the flow run data were included in the analysis but the same overall results were produced table 3 the mulch cover factor was a stronger control for splash sediment concentration and sediment yield the f value for splash stayed the same and the f values for sediment concentration and sediment yield increased when the flow run was included table 3 4 discussion 4 1 compaction effects on runoff we increased the bulk density in our sandy loam soil by 20 with the compaction treatment the significantly lower infiltration and leaching in the compacted plots was attributed to decreases in micro porosity ares et al 2005 schäffer et al 2007 during the dry run uncompacted soils were able to store 18 19 mm and leached 1 3 mm of the rainfall while the compacted soils stored only 8 12 mm of rainfall and produced negligible leaching fig 4 as a consequence of the lower infiltration compacted soils produced 41 and 127 more runoff under dry soil conditions for compacted bare and mulched plots respectively relative to their uncompacted counterparts fig 3a the increase in runoff was less pronounced for the wet run and this result was similar to results from rainfall simulations on native surface roads foltz and burroughs 1990 lower increases in bulk density 2 14 on agricultural sandy loam soils also led to 8 33 more runoff adekalu et al 2006 ekwe and harrilal 2010 on the other hand compaction of finer textured soils led to lower increases in bulk density 4 6 but greater increases in runoff than we measured 25 70 irrespective of laboratory or field conditions ekwe and harrilal 2010 these comparisons illustrate that the relationship between runoff response and bulk density is not linear the impact of compaction on bulk density depends on soil texture soil organic matter soil moisture and the compaction method and these dependencies can explain some of the differences in the changes in observed bulk density among these studies also as demonstrated in our study and the previous studies adekalu et al 2006 ekwe and harrilal 2010 it is difficult to simulate an increase in bulk density that replicates field conditions in the uncompacted plots the soil moisture at 3 cm and runoff generation were delayed until about 5 8 min into the dry run and we attribute this to filling of the interception and surface storage capacity these results were similar to other rainfall simulation studies groen and woods 2008 robichaud et al 2016 where this early period was identified as having the highest infiltration capacity this initial delay in runoff was followed by a period 5 25 min in the dry run fig 2 when both soil moisture and runoff generation rapidly increased the runoff during this period was generated by infiltration excess as concomitant increases in soil moisture resulted in lower infiltration capacity in the plots from about 5 25 min in the dry run fig 2 after about 25 min into the dry run the soil moisture was relatively stable and near its maximum and this is likely when the wetting front reached the soil moisture sensor from 25 min through the remainder of the dry wet and flow runs the runoff was approximately steady fig 2 and still generated by infiltration excess but the infiltration was at a minimum saturation never occurred in the uncompacted plots because they were able to freely drain and there were no impeding interfaces within the soil profile in the compacted plots the increase in soil moisture at 3 cm depth was much slower than in the uncompacted plots and we attribute the reduced rate to lower porosity and lower unsaturated soil hydraulic conductivity the lower porosity also reduced the total water storage capacity of compacted plots even though the storage capacity was lower than in the uncompacted plots it took longer to wet up because of the lower conductivity in the compacted soil in this sense the compaction effect on infiltration and hence runoff would be similar to that of other processes that impede infiltration such as soil sealing smets and poesen 2009 or soil water repellency shakesby and doerr 2006 4 2 compaction effect on erosion the dry wet and flow runs produced different results for each erosion process rain splash was slightly higher for the dry run than for the wet run table 2 and this was attributed to a higher depth of surface water in the wet run because of the increase in overland flow during that period which provided more protection from raindrop detachment sander et al 1996 during the dry run soil compaction doubled rain splash as compared to the uncompacted plots we attribute this increase to the destruction of the remaining aggregates on the surface of the soil by the pressure we applied via the plate to compact the soil in contrast the uncompacted plots retained small aggregates and a higher soil roughness schäffer et al 2007 julião et al 2011 the fewer number of small aggregates and the pressure in the compacted plots resulted in a lower soil roughness and rainsplash has been shown to increase on as soil surface roughness decreases roth and helming 1992 sheetwash measured by sediment yield increased across all the treatments from the dry to the wet run and was strongly related to splash erosion fig 5 the increase in sheetwash yield was a consequence of greater runoff volumes in the wet runs and similar sediment concentrations between the dry and wet runs compaction doubled the amount of sheetwash sediment delivery and this result is consistent with earlier studies for example post fire soils compacted by heavy logging machines exhibited increases in soil losses of 7 to 17fold as compared to uncompacted burned and logged wagenbrenner et al 2016 or unlogged soils malvar et al 2017 the sediment yield compaction ratios compacted uncompacted in previous studies were higher for dry soils 2 6 than for wet soils 1 1 8 burroughs and king 1989 foltz and burroughs 1990 wilson 1999 croke et al 2001 the compaction ratio for our bare plots in the dry run 1 9 was close to the corresponding range from the previous works and our ratio for the wet run 1 7 was in the range from earlier studies fig 3a in contrast to our findings and the compaction ratios from earlier research some earlier studies have shown that compaction decreased soil loss by 19 to 54 as compared to uncompacted soils adekalu et al 2006 ekwe and harrilal 2010 those results were attributed to greater soil strength resulting from compaction and were determined on soils with less compaction 10 14 increases in bulk density than in our experiment some evidence of these contrasting findings were apparent in our flow run where compaction and simulated rutting decreased rill sediment delivery by 72 on the bare plots we attribute this to both the higher erodibility of the uncompacted bare soils and the confinement of the runoff in the simulated ruts ruts have been found to increase erosion as compared to unrutted areas foltz and burroughs 1990 but here again it is difficult to separate the effect of the higher bulk density and presumably greater soil strength and the effect of flow concentration within the ruts prototype experiments without ruts resulted in rill sediment delivery rates of 390 g m 2 data not shown whereas the mean sediment delivery with ruts in our uncompacted bare plots was 2 2 times this value and 3 6 times the sediment delivery from the compacted soil with ruts in summary ruts were very effective in concentrating runoff fig 1 but deeper rilling and greater sediment delivery happened only as a result of both rutting and low bulk density on the uncompacted bare soils fig 6 4 3 cover effect on hydrologic responses neither mulch nor slash led to significant runoff reductions in the uncompacted or compacted plots and these results were consistent with some other research using rainfall simulations pannkuk and robichaud 2003 robichaud et al 2013c and natural rainfall robichaud et al 2013a b however some studies have reported decreases in runoff rates when mulch was tested using rainfall simulations in laboratory adekalu et al 2006 ekwe and harrilal 2010 foltz and wagenbrenner 2010 and field settings groen and woods 2008 as well as in field settings under natural rainfall prats et al 2012 jourgholami and abari 2017 conceptually the differences among these results may be related to the soils the amount and rate of rainfall applied the interception storage capacity of the mulch the plot dimensions or the analytical technique however the results in both categories spanned a wide range of simulated rainfall intensities 34 65 mm h 1 in the no mulch effect group 51 100 mm h 1 in mulch effect group and similar plot sizes 0 5 to 4 m2 no effect and 0 5 4 8 m2 for the mulch effect group unfortunately insufficient details are provided across the different soils regarding permeability and about the water storage potential of the mulches to draw any general conclusion future research may answer the question about why mulching sometimes reduces runoff similarly in our study neither mulch nor slash led to changes in leaching for the timescale of the simulation table 2 but some differences are noticeable in the time series data fig 2 previous research on surface cover materials such as mulch ash and stones has shown that the presence of these materials can increase leaching ruiz sinoga and martinez murillo 2009 prats et al 2017 2018 changes in leaching have been related to the water volume storage of the surface components for example our mulch and slash water storage capacities were 0 5 and 5 mm respectively fig 4 until the time the storage was filled this surface storage would reduce runoff volume and therefore runoff velocity and erosivity more importantly the wet mulch or slash layer may also increase the water contact at the soil surface thereby promoting infiltration through larger pores that are only conductive near saturation woods and balfour 2010 these differences were not enough to affect the plot scale runoff or leaching rates but they can be observed in the differences in the hydrographs of the uncompacted plots fig 2 the mulched plots show slightly higher rates of soil moisture increase and lower runoff rates in the uncompacted plots in the compacted plots the pores were smaller and the difference in porosity schäffer et al 2007 explains the lack of observable impact of mulching on the soil moisture after the dry run fig 2 and the lack of difference in runoff among the bare mulch and slash plots thus in our study the mulch and slash stored water on the compacted soils which was also shown in the longer runoff start and end times but this effect was countered by the loss of larger pores due to compaction resulting in infiltration primarily via capillarity and therefore a much lower hydraulic conductivity and hence total infiltration rate 4 4 cover effects on erosion mulching resulted in higher reductions of splash erosion 73 78 than sheetwash erosion 51 64 as compared to unmulched plots we attribute the changes in splash to reduced energy as the drops hit the soil due to mulch interception which is reflected in the longer runoff start times in the uncompacted mulched plots during the dry run as the mulch absorbed much of the first 0 5 mm of rainfall the runoff start times for the wet and flow runs in the mulch and slash plots were nearly double their counterparts in the bare plots for both the uncompacted and compacted conditions although none of these differences were significant the tendency toward longer start times after the storage capacity of the mulch was filled during the dry runs reflect the increased surface roughness and resultant reduced runoff velocity and erosive power of the runoff robichaud et al 2013c foltz and wagenbrenner 2010 shredded sequoia bark mulch applied at a rate of 2 mg ha 1 and 60 cover reduced the overall sediment yield by 84 for the uncompacted soils and by 61 for the compacted soils similar reductions in sediment yields have been shown for straw mulch at comparable rates of surface cover on native surface roads burroughs and king 1989 mulching provides surface cover and thereby serves the same role as a natural soil cover of litter or vegetation absorbing rain drop energy and reducing splash detachment and soil de figueiredo and poesen 1998 larsen et al 2009 mulch of different types including agricultural straw wood shreds and shredded bark has been shown to reduce erosion after wildfires due to these reasons badía and martí 2000 wagenbrenner et al 2006 kim et al 2008 prats et al 2012 robichaud et al 2013a b c the slash reduced splash erosion as efficiently as the mulch but there was only a slight reduction in sheetwash and this occurred only in the dry run the sharp increases in sediment concentration from the dry to wet to flow runs 12 20 and 40 g l 1 respectively indicated that the splash detached particles were not stored by the slash and that they were available for transport by overland flow further because the slash cover was made up of larger pieces of material than the mulch there was less contact between the slash and the soil surface and therefore a smaller increase in surface roughness for the same amount of surface cover fig 7 resulting in ample transport capacity to deliver the particles to the outlet of the plot other research using different slash materials found striking differences in erosion mitigation possibly due to the wide application rates length and contact of slash pieces and possibly also due to differences in wildfire severity or other plot or soil characteristics shakesby et al 1996 found that 80 cover of pine slash only reduced erosion by 50 while 89 cover of eucalypt slash reduced erosion by 91 in contrast prats et al 2012 found that 76 cover of eucalypt slash only reduced erosion by 16 although other research has suggested that achieving 60 70 ground cover in burned areas can significantly reduce soil erosion our results suggest that increasing both the amount of surface cover and the degree of contact of the cover with the soil surface are important paningbatan et al 1995 wagenbrenner et al 2016 slash seemed to reduce sediment delivery while the soil was relatively dry even though the splash detachment from the dry soil was greater because the runoff generation and transport capacity were low but because the slash was not as continuously in contact with the soil as the mulch it allowed sheet flow to travel underneath with less impedance in contrast mulching locally slowed the runoff allowing some sediment to deposit without resuspension some studies concluded that slash needs to be in contact with the soil surface to maximize erosion reduction cambi et al 2015 wagenbrenner et al 2016 slash added to the soil before the passing of machinery reduced soil compaction eliasson and wästerlund 2007 and will probably reduce sediment yields due to increased contact with the soil this aspect of slash remains to be tested under controlled or natural runoff conditions 5 conclusions we assessed soil compaction uncompacted or compacted and the presence 0 or 60 cover and type of ground cover bark mulch or logging slash on the hydrologic and erosion responses of a burned soil using laboratory rainfall simulations 30 min of rainfall at 72 mm h 1 on dry and wet soil followed by concentrated flow pulses on wet soil the runoff coefficients runoff rainfall for the combined dry and wet runs were 48 for the uncompacted bare plots and 60 for the compacted plots reflecting the apparent but not significant increase in runoff due to compaction mulching of these plots slightly reduced the runoff coefficient on the uncompacted plots 42 but there were no differences in runoff after the addition of mulch or slash cover on the compacted plots leaching accounted for 10 of the incident rainfall on the uncompacted bare plots and this decreased significantly to 0 due to compaction mulching again resulted in not significant increases in leaching 16 of rainfall on the uncompacted plots but had no effect on the compacted mulch or slash plots soil compaction also increased rainsplash from 38 g in the uncompacted plots to 74 g in the compacted plots and sediment delivery by sheetwash 496 uncompacted 902 g m 2 compacted but these differences were not significant rill sediment delivery in the flow run decreased from 858 in the uncompacted bare plots to 237 gm 2 in the compacted bare plots and we attribute this significant decrease to the greater energy needed to detach soil particles in the compacted plots the mulch significantly reduced rainsplash by 72 sheetwash by 63 and rill sediment delivery by 95 as compared to the uncompacted bare soil mulching of the compacted soils significantly reduced splash by 78 sheetwash by 52 although not significantly and rill sediment delivery by 78 as compared to the bare compacted soils slash cover on the compacted plots also significantly decreased rainsplash erosion by 75 but had no significant effect on sheetwash or rill sediment delivery as compared to the compacted bare plots while the reductions in rainsplash in the mulched plots were attributed to the reduced energy imparted to the soil by rain drops the reductions in sheetwash and rilling were assigned to the increase in roughness and high degree of contact between the mulch and soil surface which combined resulted in less energy available for particle detachment and transport by overland flow like the mulch slash provided enough areal cover to reduce rainsplash erosion but unlike the mulch its lack of surface contact did not affect soil detachment or transport capacity of either sheetwash or concentrated flow our results suggest that soil compaction that can occur during post fire logging with ground based machinery may increase runoff and significantly increase erosion rates at small spatial scales increasing surface cover using mulch from the shredded bark of sequoia sempervirens or from logging slash did not reduce runoff rates but both types of cover reduced rainsplash and the mulch also reduced sediment delivery by flowing water post fire logging slash placed on bare compacted soil lacked contact with the soil and did not affect interrill or rill sediment delivery rates the potential reduction capacity of adding slash as a post fire logging erosion mitigation practice may increase by either shredding the slash to make the pieces smaller prior to application or by applying the slash before or during the use of heavy machinery so that the slash is

6353,soil compaction during post fire logging can increase runoff and erosion increasing surface cover is an effective way to reduce erosion but this has not been tested on soils impacted by both fire and compaction we measured the effects of compaction bulk density of 0 9 or 1 1 g cm 3 and surface cover 0 or 60 using bark mulch or logging slash compacted only on runoff leaching and erosion four 0 5 m2 plots per treatment were filled with burned soil and inclined to 18 two 30 min simulated rainfall events with 72 mm h 1 intensity and one concentrated flow event were applied to each plot the runoff from the dry and wet runs totaled 32 mm in the uncompacted bare plots and the value was not significantly different for the compacted bare plots any of the mulch plots or the compacted slash plots leaching was higher for the uncompacted bare plots 7 mm than for the compacted bare plots 1 mm and mulch or slash did not affect leaching the uncompacted bare plots produced 38 g of rainsplash and 497 g m 2 of sheetwash and these were about half the values for the compacted bare plots mulching strongly reduced the rainsplash and sheetwash for both the uncompacted 10 g and 184 g m 2 respectively and compacted conditions 19 g and 431 g m 2 respectively although the difference in sheetwash was only significant for the uncompacted plots slash also reduced rainsplash 19 g relative to the compacted bare plots 74 g but did not affect sheetwash concentrated flow produced 858 g m 2 of rilling from the uncompacted bare plots which was greater than the compacted plots 237 g m 2 mulching reduced rilling by 95 in the uncompacted plots and 78 in the compacted plots but slash did not reduce rilling the reductions in rainsplash erosion caused by the mulch and slash were attributed to the increase in surface cover which reduced the energy imparted to the soil by the rainfall the mulch with its high degree of contact with the soil also reduced particle detachment and transport by overland flow in contrast the slash did not have complete contact with the soil surface and did not affect sheetwash or rilling compaction and the type of material used to increase surface cover are important factors to consider when assessing potential impacts of logging on runoff and sediment delivery from burned soils keywords mulch runoff sheetwash soil moisture salvage logging 1 introduction runoff and soil erosion can increase substantially after wildfires especially in severely burned areas benavides solorio and macdonald 2001 2005 moody et al 2013 these increases have been associated with negative on site and off site effects such as soil fertility losses shakesby 2011 stream water pollution emelko et al 2011 lewis et al 2018 and sedimentation shakesby 2011 robichaud et al 2016 soil compaction by machinery used during post fire logging activities has been shown to affect soil roughness bulk density and shear strength and it can increase post fire runoff and erosion croke et al 1999a b 2001 mciver and mcneil 2006 silins et al 2009 emelko et al 2011 which may greatly exacerbate the detrimental effects of the wildfire itself some post fire field studies have shown that unlogged areas exhibited lower runoff and erosion volumes as compared to soils impacted by logging equipment wagenbrenner et al 2015 2016 malvar et al 2017 in contrast other experiments have shown that compaction or disturbance related to post fire logging led to lower soil erosion rates adekalu et al 2006 ekwe and harrilal 2010 james and krumland 2018 soil surface cover such as litter stones char ash and vegetation cover are known to inhibit surface runoff arnau rosalén et al 2008 ruiz sinoga and martinez murillo 2009 prats et al 2017 2018 and soil erosion de figueiredo and poesen 1998 cerdà and doerr 2005 prats et al 2012 but the effects of added cover on runoff and erosion from burned and compacted soils are not well understood post fire soil erosion rates have been directly linked to low ground cover rates larsen et al 2009 and mulch application rates have been determined for several materials for agriculture smets et al 2008 post fire hillslopes robichaud et al 2010b and roads burroughs and king 1989 it is widely assumed that mulching at rates above 60 ground cover can significantly reduce soil erosion burroughs and king 1989 robichaud et al 2000 smets et al 2008 robichaud et al 2010b moody et al 2013 different materials can be used as mulches and the main differences among mulch materials relate to density application rate and resistance to physical degradation on the ground surface application rates ranged from 1 to 11 mg ha 1 with straw and forest residue mulches for post fire unlogged environments robichaud et al 2010b prats et al 2016 while slash application rates for reducing soil erosion in skidder compacted soils can be more than 10 times higher 28 165 mg ha 1 cambi et al 2015 jourgholami and abari 2017 because of its larger particle size slash is not always effective in reducing erosion from surface runoff for example wagenbrenner et al 2016 found that manually adding harvest residues to attain at least 50 cover on skidder compacted soils resulting from post fire salvage logging did not affect sediment flux rates the researchers also suggest that specific best management practices are needed to mitigate the hydrologic impacts of post fire salvage logging besides ground cover other factors such as soil properties soil moisture soil texture slope angle skidder characteristics ground pressure and rainfall characteristics such as rainfall intensity cambi et al 2015 can have important roles in soil erosion in spite of a number of studies assessing the mitigation of post fire soil erosion with mulching e g bautista et al 1996 wagenbrenner et al 2006 robichaud et al 2010b fernandez et al 2011 robichaud et al 2013a prats et al 2016 very little is known about the reasons why mulch is a relatively effective treatment mulch seems to be effective due to three components i increasing interception of raindrops and associated reduction in rain splash detachment ii reducing soil surface sealing and crusting which thereby increases infiltration and reduces surface runoff rates bautista et al 1996 and iii increased surface roughness and obstruction of overland flow that results in lower soil detachment by sheetflow and rilling pannkuk and robichaud 2003 giménez and govers 2008 the increase in surface roughness by mulch promoted infiltration and lowered runoff velocities in areas treated with mulch and this reduced sediment transport robichaud et al 2013c foltz and wagenbrenner 2010 observed that overland flow is often temporarily stored upslope of mini debris dams that form when strands of mulch and litter interlock and these small ephemeral ponds may increase infiltration however it is difficult to determine the proportion of erosion reduction that can be attributed to protecting the soil from raindrop impact as opposed to slowing overland flow velocity or increasing detention storage robichaud et al 2013c in general the mulch success is often attributed to the increase in ground cover without identification of a specific process change it has been very difficult to isolate the runoff i e saturation excess vs infiltration excess and erosion mechanisms i e splash sheetwash or rill for example flanagan and nearing 1995 described sheetwash or interrill erosion as the combination of soil detachment resulting from the impact of water drops directly on soil particles rainsplash and the associated transport of the detached particles by shallow overland flow sheetwash most of the past laboratory research studied combinations of processes such as splash and sheetwash de figueiredo and poesen 1998 only sheetwash foltz et al 2009 sheetwash and rill erosion foltz and wagenbrenner 2010 sheetwash and rill erosion croke et al 2001 there have been more studies addressing solely rill erosion nearing et al 1999 robichaud et al 2010a wagenbrenner et al 2010 wagenbrenner et al 2016 but studies independently assessing each of the three mechanisms are generally lacking understanding the relative magnitudes of splash sheetwash and rill erosion on total soil losses will help us to determine the mechanism s affected by mulch that lead to reductions in erosion and also help refine specific measures for post fire management scenarios the main aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of compaction and the presence and type of ground cover on post fire runoff and soil erosion our specific objectives were to 1 determine if soil compaction affects hydrologic responses runoff leaching soil moisture and runoff timing 2 determine the effects of compaction on rainsplash sheetwash and rill erosion and 3 determine if adding sequoia bark strand mulch or logging slash changes these hydrologic or erosional responses we used laboratory rainfall and flow simulations to isolate each hydrologic and erosion processes 2 materials and methods the effects of two levels of soil compaction uncompacted and compacted and two levels of ground cover 0 and 60 sequoia bark mulch cover on runoff leaching soil moisture runoff timing rainsplash sheetwash and rilling were tested with a rainfall simulator the 60 cover rate was chosen as it is generally considered the minimum amount of cover for erosion control in different environments smets et al 2008 robichaud et al 2010b burroughs and king 1989 and widely used as a coverage target in operational post fire mulching the study used a replicated full factorial completely randomized design with four replications of the four combinations of the two factors treatments a fifth treatment with compacted soil and 60 cover of logging slash was also included the plot preparation and subsequent simulations were randomly ordered among the treatments the simulations were done indoors in mckinleyville california usa between january and april 2017 each simulation was comprised of three parts dry wet and flow in order to test the responses of the treatments under different antecedent soil moisture dry and wet and to test the treatments under rill initiation flow splash erosion was also measured during the dry and wet runs 2 1 plot preparation soil was collected from the boggs mountain demonstration state forest bmdsf located in north central california 38 81443 n 122 67339 w which was burned by the valley fire in 2015 a separate research project assessing hydrologic and erosional responses to post fire forest management was underway at this location and several experiments are still ongoing as part of the ongoing experiments soil bulk density was measured using a bulk density sampler with a 5 5 cm cylindrical core in uncompacted areas and in areas where skidder traffic had caused compaction bulk density at 0 5 cm soil depth was 0 76 0 08 g cm 3 mean standard deviation n 13 in the uncompacted soil and 0 96 0 05 g cm 3 in the compacted soil n 13 indicating an increase in bulk density from the skidder traffic of 26 the soil for the simulations was gathered from a hillslope burned at high severity 1100 m a s l and a steepness of 12 where no equipment had passed since the fire these soils were deep well drained formed from igneous rocks and exhibited andic soil properties edinger marshall et al 2016 the soil corresponded to the whispering series loamy skeletal mixed mesic ultic haploxeralfs soil survey staff 2003 stones larger than 8 mm diameter constituted 15 4 of the bulk soil mass gravel 2 to 8 mm was 19 8 sand was 47 2 and silt and clay made up 17 6 of the mass soil organic matter determined by loss on ignition from 15 replicates 550 c at 4 h was very high 0 182 g g 1 in preparation for the rainfall simulations stones and gravel greater than 6 3 mm were removed by sieving resulting in a gravelly sandy loam texture with a gravel content of 17 steel square plots 70 cm wide by 70 cm long 0 49 m2 and 15 cm deep had a 1 cm metal grid bottom that we covered with a porous geotextile fabric that allowed water to permeate this water was funneled to a hose for the measurement of the leaching volume fig 1 the plots were gently filled with uncompacted air dried soil a single pass of a straight edged blade was used to produce a flat surface with a uniform soil depth as confirmed with a rigid steel needle inserted in the soil at 6 locations table 1 the downslope edge of the plot consisted of a metal lip at a height of 5 cm which corresponded to the top of the soil fig 1 this lip was connected to a detachable gutter where surface runoff was funneled to a hose for collection robichaud et al 2016 mean bulk density for the uncompacted soil in the laboratory was higher than measured in the field and this was attributed to the absence of large aggregates which were destroyed by sieving before plot preparation for the compacted treatment additional dry soil was added to the plot table 1 and the soil was compacted with a 5 kg hammer to a plate that covered the full plot during roughly 1 h the dry soil was compacted to a similar soil depth and resulted in a bulk density that was 20 higher than the uncompacted condition three soil cores were used to sample bulk density and soil moisture within each plot table 1 and the three holes were gently refilled with a proportional amount of soil some plots were discarded if the bulk density was greater than 0 91 g cm 3 in the uncompacted treatment or lower than 1 04 g cm 3 in the compacted treatment after carrying out the simulations another three bulk density samples were gathered in areas undisturbed by the flow run and these samples were also used to measure gravimetric soil moisture all bulk density samples were dried at 105 c for 24 h astm 2007 a soil moisture sensor ech2o 5 tm meter group pullman wa was installed at 3 cm depth in the lower left corner of the plot a handheld read out device stored soil moisture every minute during the simulations and for 5 min after rainfall stopped initial and final soil moisture for each run was also recorded for statistical analysis sequoia sequoia sempervirens d don endl bark shreds and strands were sieved through a 4 cm screen to remove the smaller portion foltz and wagenbrenner 2010 prats et al 2017 dried at 105 c for 24 h and applied at a rate of 200 g m 2 to the mulched plots to obtain a target surface cover of 60 cover table 1 for the slash plots logging slash was gathered from bmdsf after wildfire and logging activities and was composed of either ponderosa pine pinus ponderosa douglas ex c lawson or douglas fir pseudotsuga menziesii mirb franco stems and branches of 1 9 0 6 cm diameter and 34 1 10 6 cm length oven dried slash was applied by hand at a rate of 3400 g m 2 to each slash treated plot to achieve the nominal target of 60 cover table 1 actual mulch or slash cover was measured with point counts on a 5 cm grid and material was added or removed to achieve the target cover amount table 1 we measured the saturated water retention capacity of the mulch and slash by subtracting the oven dried mass 105 c 24 h from the saturated mass yielding an average water retention capacity of 2 6 0 4 g water per g of mulch and 1 4 0 3 g water per g of slash 2 2 rainfall and inflow simulations a portable purdue type rainfall simulator bertrand and parr 1961 with a single oscillating veejet 80 100 s s co h3 8u pressurized nozzle spraying systems co wheaton il was set at 3 m above the center of the plot this oscillating arm rainfall simulator was designed and fabricated at the usda forest service rocky mountain research station following similar designs paige et al 2003 the water pressure was set at 55 kpa which produced an initial velocity of approximately 8 8 m s 1 meyer and harmon 1979 which closely approximated the terminal velocity of natural raindrops of this size van dijk et al 2002 and produced an impact kinetic energy of 271 kj ha 1 mm 1 paige et al 2003 the rainfall intensity was set by the number of oscillations which was controlled with a small fixed speed motor and a solenoid norton and savabi 2010 we achieved a rainfall intensity of 72 1 5 mm h 1 using a run time of 97 rainfall of this intensity over a 30 minute duration would occur on average less than every 100 years at bmdsf but this high application rate assured the rainfall rate exceeded the infiltration capacity of the soil and assured surface runoff from each treatment foltz and wagenbrenner 2010 and the rate was on the low end of the range of intensities used in other post fire rainfall simulation studies robichaud et al 2016 the plot was inclined to 18 to simulate the average slope of the bmdsf study sites and centered below the nozzle fig 1 prior to each dry run the rainfall rate was tested and the applied rainfall was collected in a calibration pan that covered the top of the plot frame three to five 1 minute samples were collected from the outlet of the calibration pan and weighed with a portable scale if necessary the nozzle run time was adjusted to achieve the target rainfall intensity rainfall splashed material was collected along the downslope end of the plot for each dry and wet run using a 60 cm by a 40 cm piece of geotextile the skaps gt 140 needle punched nonwoven geotextile fabric was porous 136 g m 2 skaps inc athens ga usa allowing water to permeate and retaining sediments larger than the 0 21 mm opening sizes prior to installation the splash fabric pieces were numbered dried 105 c 24 h and weighed the fabric was secured to the plot frame at the outlet 2 cm above the soil surface with clips and wood posts forming a 70 cm wide 20 cm high and 20 cm deep splash collector above the detachable gutter fig 1 de figueiredo and poesen 1998 the splash fabric collected rain splashed material coming from the upslope direction while surface runoff passed beneath the fabric to the gutter and funnel after 30 min of rainfall on the dry soil dry run the simulation was interrupted for approximately 1 h during this break the splash fabric was removed and stored in a pan the sediment deposited in the gutter was removed and stored in a separate pan a new piece of splash fabric was installed and the rainfall intensity was re calibrated the wet run was also 30 min and after the wet run we again removed and stored the splash fabric and deposited sediment approximately 1 h after the wet run ruts were simulated on the bare and mulched plots and inflow was delivered in four short pulses at the top of each plot to simulate overland flow from upslope nearing et al 1999 to simulate the ruts a small toy truck with rubber wheels was passed diagonally over the plot with uniform hand pressure in order to introduce depressions on the soil surface fig 1 these simulated ruts were not scaled to field conditions and were intended only to simulate the effects of ruts or tracks on concentrating runoff and inducing the formation of rills wagenbrenner et al 2016 the size of the wood pieces prevented introduction of the simulated ruts in the slash treated plots each pulse consisted of 1 1 l of clear water that was instantaneously gravity fed at the upslope center of the plot via a 10 cm wide flow box fig 1 the four pulses resulted in an overall flow rate of 4 3 0 8 l min 1 equivalent to a total of 10 3 0 6 mm in each flow run table 1 which was comparable to rates used in other rill experiments foltz and wagenbrenner 2010 robichaud et al 2010a prats et al 2017 2018 sediment deposited in the gutter during the flow run was also collected and stored separately from the sediment deposited during from the dry and wet runs runoff start time for the dry and wet runs was the time between the initiation of rainfall and the time when runoff at the outlet of the plot was more than 1 drop per 3 s for the flow run the start time was the period between the release of the runoff pulse and the instant when the runoff reached the bottom of the plot runoff end time was the time between the cessation of rainfall or runoff pulses and the time when runoff at the outlet of the plot was less than 1 drop per 3 s timed runoff samples were collected in separate pre labeled and pre weighed bottles each minute between the runoff start and stop times the runoff produced by each runoff pulse during the flow run was collected in a single bottle leaching for each run was the volume of water that permeated the bottom of the plot all runoff samples splash fabrics and sediment deposited in the gutter were weighed oven dried 105 c 24 h and re weighed to obtain runoff volume mm sediment concentration g l 1 splash material g and dry sediment deposited in the gutter g the deposited sediment was included in the total sediment yield g m 2 for each run runoff leaching and sheetwash and rill sediment dry weights were divided by the horizontal projection of the plot area 0 474 m2 to produce unit area runoff leaching and sediment yields respectively runoff coefficients were the runoff volumes divided by the applied rainfall or inflow volumes ratios were calculated to demonstrate the effect of compaction compacted value uncompacted value and addition of cover mulch or slash value bare value for runoff leaching splash and sediment yield 2 3 statistical analysis analyses were performed using three way mixed effects models on the response variables surface runoff leaching initial and final soil moisture runoff start time runoff end time splash sediment yield and sediment concentration in each model compaction uncompacted and compacted soils cover bare mulch and slash and run dry wet and flow were the fixed effects and plot was the random effect we also ran the same model excluding the slash treatment because it was only present on the compacted soils which resulted in two simpler mixed effects models one with two levels of compaction two levels of cover and three levels of run and another with only two levels of run dry and wet these two reduced models were constructed in order to assess the weight of compaction and cover factors on the hydrologic and the erosive response variables in balanced statistical models all interactions among fixed factors were also considered all dependent variables except runoff and final soil moisture were 4th root transformed to achieve normally distributed model residuals autoregressive variance covariance structures were selected for the mixed effects models littell et al 2006 multiple pair wise comparisons were computed on all significant treatment and interaction effects using the tukey kramer procedure kramer 1956 simple linear regressions with intercept set to the origin were calculated for splash versus sheetwash sediment yields for the dry and wet runs and similarly for the combined dry and wet run splash sediment yield versus the rill sediment yield for the flow run all the statistical assumptions used α 0 05 and all statistical analyses were carried out using sas 9 3 sas institute inc 2016 3 results 3 1 hydrologic results runoff in the dry run started after 276 s in the uncompacted bare plots as compared to 213 s for the compacted bare plots but this difference was not significant table 2 the mulch significantly delayed the onset of runoff in the uncompacted plots 487 s but mulch and slash had no significant effect in the compacted plots table 2 runoff start times consistently and significantly decreased for the wet runs 52 90 s for each treatment and there were no differences among treatments in either the wet or flow runs runoff end times averaged 189 s for the uncompacted bare dry runs and none of the other treatments had a significantly different mean runoff end time table 2 the mean runoff end time for the uncompacted bare wet runs was 175 s and this did not differ from the value from the dry run the compaction and cover treatments generally increased the wet run end time but only the compacted mulch plots produced a significantly longer end time relative to the uncompacted bare value table 2 the compacted mulch plots also had a longer mean run time for the wet run than for the dry run for the flow runs the mean end time was 177 s for the uncompacted bare plots and all of the other treatments had significantly greater runoff end times than this table 2 from the onset of runoff runoff coefficients progressively increased within each run and between runs fig 2 the runoff coefficients exceed 50 by the end of each dry run and exceeded 60 for most of each wet run and for all of the flow runs the runoff coefficient approached 100 on the flow run for the bare plots there were no significant differences in mean runoff coefficients for any run among the treatments fig 2 runoff from the uncompacted bare plots averaged 10 mm during the dry run 22 mm from the wet run and 10 mm from the flow run table 2 the mean plot total runoff for the uncompacted bare treatment 43 mm represents 54 of the water volume applied to the plot runoff volumes for all treatments increased significantly from the dry to the wet run table 2 compaction did not significantly increase the runoff for the bare plots as compared to the uncompacted bare plots in any of the runs table 2 mulching did not affect the runoff rate for any of the runs as compared to the uncompacted bare plots similarly there were no differences in runoff due to mulch or slash for a given run among the compacted plots table 2 leaching from the uncompacted bare plots averaged 1 mm in the dry run 6 mm in the wet run and 0 mm in the flow run totaling 7 mm for the simulation or 9 of the total amount of water applied to the plot table 2 soil compaction significantly decreased leaching regardless of the cover treatments and only the bare compacted plot produced any leachate table 2 the leaching from the uncompacted mulch plots was greater for each run than uncompacted bare plots and totaled 12 mm 18 but none of the apparent differences fig 3 were significant the initial soil moisture from the laboratory measurements was 7 for the uncompacted bare plots and none of the other treatments significantly varied from this table 1 the soil moisture from the sensor at 3 cm below the soil surface started at 3 for the uncompacted bare plots and the initial value for the uncompacted mulch plots was not significantly different table 2 the compacted plots all had initial soil moisture of 9 the soil moisture increased significantly for each treatment during the dry run table 2 the soil moisture in the uncompacted treatments increased for the first 20 25 min of the dry run and then leveled off the relatively rapid increase in the uncompacted plots resulted in 40 soil moisture in the uncompacted bare plots and 44 soil moisture in the uncompacted mulched plots at the end of the dry run fig 2 and these values were not significantly different table 2 the soil moisture for the uncompacted plots decreased slightly before the start of the wet run and then increased to a relatively constant value within about 5 min fig 2 and remained at or near the values measured at the end of the dry run through the rest of the simulations table 2 fig 2 in contrast the soil moisture in all the compacted treatments increased more gradually fig 2 and the compacted bare plots averaged only 22 at the end of the dry run which was significantly less than the uncompacted bare plots table 2 neither the compacted mulch nor the compacted slash plots had a different soil moisture than the compacted bare plots at the end of the dry run table 2 the gradual increase in soil moisture in the compacted plots continued through the wet run fig 2 and the increase in the soil moisture at the end of the wet run was significant for the compacted bare plots table 2 at the end of the flow run none of the treatments had a significantly different soil moisture than the uncompacted bare plots table 2 3 2 erosion results the uncompacted bare plots on average produced 21 g of splash erosion in the dry run and 17 g in the wet run table 2 the compacted bare plots produced nearly double these amounts fig 3a 42 g in the dry run and 32 g in the wet run although the differences were not significant table 2 mulching significantly reduced rainsplash in the uncompacted soils by 73 and 78 for the dry and wet runs respectively similarly the mulch and slash on the compacted soils both significantly reduced rainsplash by 72 to 79 for the dry and wet runs table 2 in all the treatments rainsplash was slightly higher on the dry run than on the wet run and the difference was significant for the compacted mulch plots the mean sediment concentration in the uncompacted bare plots was 18 g l 1 in the dry run 14 g l 1 in the wet run and 89 g l 1 in the more erosive flow run table 2 soil compaction increased sediment concentration during the dry 23 g l 1 and wet 22 g l 1 runs on the bare plots but neither of these values were significantly different than the uncompacted bare plot values table 2 in contrast the flow run of the compacted bare plots had a significantly lower sediment concentration 28 g l 1 than the comparable concentration in the uncompacted bare plots table 2 the mulch cover reduced the sediment concentrations in all runs as compared to the bare plots with comparable level of compaction and the reductions were significant in the flow run fig 2 table 2 the slash plots produced somewhat lower sediment concentrations than the compacted bare plots in the dry and wet runs but the differences were not significant table 2 the sediment concentration in the flow run of the compacted slash plots which did not have simulated ruts increased relative to the compacted bare plots but this difference also was not significant table 2 mean sediment yields for the uncompacted bare plots were 180 g m 2 for the dry run 317 g m 2 for the wet run and 858 g m 2 for the flow run table 2 soil compaction in the bare plots produced not significant increases in sediment yields despite compaction ratios for sediment yield of 1 90 and 1 77 for the dry and wet runs respectively fig 3a however the mean sediment yield in the flow run in the compacted bare plots was only 28 of the value for the uncompacted bare plots fig 3a and this was a significant decrease table 2 mulching significantly reduced sediment yields by 64 for the dry run 62 for the wet run and 95 for the flow run relative to the uncompacted bare plots table 2 fig 3b the sediment yield on the compacted mulch plots was about half the yield on the compacted bare plots for the dry and wet runs fig 3b and for the flow run the reduction was 78 fig 3b which was significant the compacted slash plots produced slightly lower sediment yields for the dry and wet runs than the compacted bare plots and greater sediment yields for the flow run where no ruts were introduced in the plots but none of these differences were significant table 2 the three factor statistical models which assessed the relative strength of compaction mulch cover and run indicate that compaction was a stronger control for the hydrologic variables of runoff leaching and soil moisture while cover exhibited a stronger control on runoff start and end times table 3 the f values for all the hydrologic variables except for runoff start and end times decreased slightly when the flow run data were included in the analysis but the same overall results were produced table 3 the mulch cover factor was a stronger control for splash sediment concentration and sediment yield the f value for splash stayed the same and the f values for sediment concentration and sediment yield increased when the flow run was included table 3 4 discussion 4 1 compaction effects on runoff we increased the bulk density in our sandy loam soil by 20 with the compaction treatment the significantly lower infiltration and leaching in the compacted plots was attributed to decreases in micro porosity ares et al 2005 schäffer et al 2007 during the dry run uncompacted soils were able to store 18 19 mm and leached 1 3 mm of the rainfall while the compacted soils stored only 8 12 mm of rainfall and produced negligible leaching fig 4 as a consequence of the lower infiltration compacted soils produced 41 and 127 more runoff under dry soil conditions for compacted bare and mulched plots respectively relative to their uncompacted counterparts fig 3a the increase in runoff was less pronounced for the wet run and this result was similar to results from rainfall simulations on native surface roads foltz and burroughs 1990 lower increases in bulk density 2 14 on agricultural sandy loam soils also led to 8 33 more runoff adekalu et al 2006 ekwe and harrilal 2010 on the other hand compaction of finer textured soils led to lower increases in bulk density 4 6 but greater increases in runoff than we measured 25 70 irrespective of laboratory or field conditions ekwe and harrilal 2010 these comparisons illustrate that the relationship between runoff response and bulk density is not linear the impact of compaction on bulk density depends on soil texture soil organic matter soil moisture and the compaction method and these dependencies can explain some of the differences in the changes in observed bulk density among these studies also as demonstrated in our study and the previous studies adekalu et al 2006 ekwe and harrilal 2010 it is difficult to simulate an increase in bulk density that replicates field conditions in the uncompacted plots the soil moisture at 3 cm and runoff generation were delayed until about 5 8 min into the dry run and we attribute this to filling of the interception and surface storage capacity these results were similar to other rainfall simulation studies groen and woods 2008 robichaud et al 2016 where this early period was identified as having the highest infiltration capacity this initial delay in runoff was followed by a period 5 25 min in the dry run fig 2 when both soil moisture and runoff generation rapidly increased the runoff during this period was generated by infiltration excess as concomitant increases in soil moisture resulted in lower infiltration capacity in the plots from about 5 25 min in the dry run fig 2 after about 25 min into the dry run the soil moisture was relatively stable and near its maximum and this is likely when the wetting front reached the soil moisture sensor from 25 min through the remainder of the dry wet and flow runs the runoff was approximately steady fig 2 and still generated by infiltration excess but the infiltration was at a minimum saturation never occurred in the uncompacted plots because they were able to freely drain and there were no impeding interfaces within the soil profile in the compacted plots the increase in soil moisture at 3 cm depth was much slower than in the uncompacted plots and we attribute the reduced rate to lower porosity and lower unsaturated soil hydraulic conductivity the lower porosity also reduced the total water storage capacity of compacted plots even though the storage capacity was lower than in the uncompacted plots it took longer to wet up because of the lower conductivity in the compacted soil in this sense the compaction effect on infiltration and hence runoff would be similar to that of other processes that impede infiltration such as soil sealing smets and poesen 2009 or soil water repellency shakesby and doerr 2006 4 2 compaction effect on erosion the dry wet and flow runs produced different results for each erosion process rain splash was slightly higher for the dry run than for the wet run table 2 and this was attributed to a higher depth of surface water in the wet run because of the increase in overland flow during that period which provided more protection from raindrop detachment sander et al 1996 during the dry run soil compaction doubled rain splash as compared to the uncompacted plots we attribute this increase to the destruction of the remaining aggregates on the surface of the soil by the pressure we applied via the plate to compact the soil in contrast the uncompacted plots retained small aggregates and a higher soil roughness schäffer et al 2007 julião et al 2011 the fewer number of small aggregates and the pressure in the compacted plots resulted in a lower soil roughness and rainsplash has been shown to increase on as soil surface roughness decreases roth and helming 1992 sheetwash measured by sediment yield increased across all the treatments from the dry to the wet run and was strongly related to splash erosion fig 5 the increase in sheetwash yield was a consequence of greater runoff volumes in the wet runs and similar sediment concentrations between the dry and wet runs compaction doubled the amount of sheetwash sediment delivery and this result is consistent with earlier studies for example post fire soils compacted by heavy logging machines exhibited increases in soil losses of 7 to 17fold as compared to uncompacted burned and logged wagenbrenner et al 2016 or unlogged soils malvar et al 2017 the sediment yield compaction ratios compacted uncompacted in previous studies were higher for dry soils 2 6 than for wet soils 1 1 8 burroughs and king 1989 foltz and burroughs 1990 wilson 1999 croke et al 2001 the compaction ratio for our bare plots in the dry run 1 9 was close to the corresponding range from the previous works and our ratio for the wet run 1 7 was in the range from earlier studies fig 3a in contrast to our findings and the compaction ratios from earlier research some earlier studies have shown that compaction decreased soil loss by 19 to 54 as compared to uncompacted soils adekalu et al 2006 ekwe and harrilal 2010 those results were attributed to greater soil strength resulting from compaction and were determined on soils with less compaction 10 14 increases in bulk density than in our experiment some evidence of these contrasting findings were apparent in our flow run where compaction and simulated rutting decreased rill sediment delivery by 72 on the bare plots we attribute this to both the higher erodibility of the uncompacted bare soils and the confinement of the runoff in the simulated ruts ruts have been found to increase erosion as compared to unrutted areas foltz and burroughs 1990 but here again it is difficult to separate the effect of the higher bulk density and presumably greater soil strength and the effect of flow concentration within the ruts prototype experiments without ruts resulted in rill sediment delivery rates of 390 g m 2 data not shown whereas the mean sediment delivery with ruts in our uncompacted bare plots was 2 2 times this value and 3 6 times the sediment delivery from the compacted soil with ruts in summary ruts were very effective in concentrating runoff fig 1 but deeper rilling and greater sediment delivery happened only as a result of both rutting and low bulk density on the uncompacted bare soils fig 6 4 3 cover effect on hydrologic responses neither mulch nor slash led to significant runoff reductions in the uncompacted or compacted plots and these results were consistent with some other research using rainfall simulations pannkuk and robichaud 2003 robichaud et al 2013c and natural rainfall robichaud et al 2013a b however some studies have reported decreases in runoff rates when mulch was tested using rainfall simulations in laboratory adekalu et al 2006 ekwe and harrilal 2010 foltz and wagenbrenner 2010 and field settings groen and woods 2008 as well as in field settings under natural rainfall prats et al 2012 jourgholami and abari 2017 conceptually the differences among these results may be related to the soils the amount and rate of rainfall applied the interception storage capacity of the mulch the plot dimensions or the analytical technique however the results in both categories spanned a wide range of simulated rainfall intensities 34 65 mm h 1 in the no mulch effect group 51 100 mm h 1 in mulch effect group and similar plot sizes 0 5 to 4 m2 no effect and 0 5 4 8 m2 for the mulch effect group unfortunately insufficient details are provided across the different soils regarding permeability and about the water storage potential of the mulches to draw any general conclusion future research may answer the question about why mulching sometimes reduces runoff similarly in our study neither mulch nor slash led to changes in leaching for the timescale of the simulation table 2 but some differences are noticeable in the time series data fig 2 previous research on surface cover materials such as mulch ash and stones has shown that the presence of these materials can increase leaching ruiz sinoga and martinez murillo 2009 prats et al 2017 2018 changes in leaching have been related to the water volume storage of the surface components for example our mulch and slash water storage capacities were 0 5 and 5 mm respectively fig 4 until the time the storage was filled this surface storage would reduce runoff volume and therefore runoff velocity and erosivity more importantly the wet mulch or slash layer may also increase the water contact at the soil surface thereby promoting infiltration through larger pores that are only conductive near saturation woods and balfour 2010 these differences were not enough to affect the plot scale runoff or leaching rates but they can be observed in the differences in the hydrographs of the uncompacted plots fig 2 the mulched plots show slightly higher rates of soil moisture increase and lower runoff rates in the uncompacted plots in the compacted plots the pores were smaller and the difference in porosity schäffer et al 2007 explains the lack of observable impact of mulching on the soil moisture after the dry run fig 2 and the lack of difference in runoff among the bare mulch and slash plots thus in our study the mulch and slash stored water on the compacted soils which was also shown in the longer runoff start and end times but this effect was countered by the loss of larger pores due to compaction resulting in infiltration primarily via capillarity and therefore a much lower hydraulic conductivity and hence total infiltration rate 4 4 cover effects on erosion mulching resulted in higher reductions of splash erosion 73 78 than sheetwash erosion 51 64 as compared to unmulched plots we attribute the changes in splash to reduced energy as the drops hit the soil due to mulch interception which is reflected in the longer runoff start times in the uncompacted mulched plots during the dry run as the mulch absorbed much of the first 0 5 mm of rainfall the runoff start times for the wet and flow runs in the mulch and slash plots were nearly double their counterparts in the bare plots for both the uncompacted and compacted conditions although none of these differences were significant the tendency toward longer start times after the storage capacity of the mulch was filled during the dry runs reflect the increased surface roughness and resultant reduced runoff velocity and erosive power of the runoff robichaud et al 2013c foltz and wagenbrenner 2010 shredded sequoia bark mulch applied at a rate of 2 mg ha 1 and 60 cover reduced the overall sediment yield by 84 for the uncompacted soils and by 61 for the compacted soils similar reductions in sediment yields have been shown for straw mulch at comparable rates of surface cover on native surface roads burroughs and king 1989 mulching provides surface cover and thereby serves the same role as a natural soil cover of litter or vegetation absorbing rain drop energy and reducing splash detachment and soil de figueiredo and poesen 1998 larsen et al 2009 mulch of different types including agricultural straw wood shreds and shredded bark has been shown to reduce erosion after wildfires due to these reasons badía and martí 2000 wagenbrenner et al 2006 kim et al 2008 prats et al 2012 robichaud et al 2013a b c the slash reduced splash erosion as efficiently as the mulch but there was only a slight reduction in sheetwash and this occurred only in the dry run the sharp increases in sediment concentration from the dry to wet to flow runs 12 20 and 40 g l 1 respectively indicated that the splash detached particles were not stored by the slash and that they were available for transport by overland flow further because the slash cover was made up of larger pieces of material than the mulch there was less contact between the slash and the soil surface and therefore a smaller increase in surface roughness for the same amount of surface cover fig 7 resulting in ample transport capacity to deliver the particles to the outlet of the plot other research using different slash materials found striking differences in erosion mitigation possibly due to the wide application rates length and contact of slash pieces and possibly also due to differences in wildfire severity or other plot or soil characteristics shakesby et al 1996 found that 80 cover of pine slash only reduced erosion by 50 while 89 cover of eucalypt slash reduced erosion by 91 in contrast prats et al 2012 found that 76 cover of eucalypt slash only reduced erosion by 16 although other research has suggested that achieving 60 70 ground cover in burned areas can significantly reduce soil erosion our results suggest that increasing both the amount of surface cover and the degree of contact of the cover with the soil surface are important paningbatan et al 1995 wagenbrenner et al 2016 slash seemed to reduce sediment delivery while the soil was relatively dry even though the splash detachment from the dry soil was greater because the runoff generation and transport capacity were low but because the slash was not as continuously in contact with the soil as the mulch it allowed sheet flow to travel underneath with less impedance in contrast mulching locally slowed the runoff allowing some sediment to deposit without resuspension some studies concluded that slash needs to be in contact with the soil surface to maximize erosion reduction cambi et al 2015 wagenbrenner et al 2016 slash added to the soil before the passing of machinery reduced soil compaction eliasson and wästerlund 2007 and will probably reduce sediment yields due to increased contact with the soil this aspect of slash remains to be tested under controlled or natural runoff conditions 5 conclusions we assessed soil compaction uncompacted or compacted and the presence 0 or 60 cover and type of ground cover bark mulch or logging slash on the hydrologic and erosion responses of a burned soil using laboratory rainfall simulations 30 min of rainfall at 72 mm h 1 on dry and wet soil followed by concentrated flow pulses on wet soil the runoff coefficients runoff rainfall for the combined dry and wet runs were 48 for the uncompacted bare plots and 60 for the compacted plots reflecting the apparent but not significant increase in runoff due to compaction mulching of these plots slightly reduced the runoff coefficient on the uncompacted plots 42 but there were no differences in runoff after the addition of mulch or slash cover on the compacted plots leaching accounted for 10 of the incident rainfall on the uncompacted bare plots and this decreased significantly to 0 due to compaction mulching again resulted in not significant increases in leaching 16 of rainfall on the uncompacted plots but had no effect on the compacted mulch or slash plots soil compaction also increased rainsplash from 38 g in the uncompacted plots to 74 g in the compacted plots and sediment delivery by sheetwash 496 uncompacted 902 g m 2 compacted but these differences were not significant rill sediment delivery in the flow run decreased from 858 in the uncompacted bare plots to 237 gm 2 in the compacted bare plots and we attribute this significant decrease to the greater energy needed to detach soil particles in the compacted plots the mulch significantly reduced rainsplash by 72 sheetwash by 63 and rill sediment delivery by 95 as compared to the uncompacted bare soil mulching of the compacted soils significantly reduced splash by 78 sheetwash by 52 although not significantly and rill sediment delivery by 78 as compared to the bare compacted soils slash cover on the compacted plots also significantly decreased rainsplash erosion by 75 but had no significant effect on sheetwash or rill sediment delivery as compared to the compacted bare plots while the reductions in rainsplash in the mulched plots were attributed to the reduced energy imparted to the soil by rain drops the reductions in sheetwash and rilling were assigned to the increase in roughness and high degree of contact between the mulch and soil surface which combined resulted in less energy available for particle detachment and transport by overland flow like the mulch slash provided enough areal cover to reduce rainsplash erosion but unlike the mulch its lack of surface contact did not affect soil detachment or transport capacity of either sheetwash or concentrated flow our results suggest that soil compaction that can occur during post fire logging with ground based machinery may increase runoff and significantly increase erosion rates at small spatial scales increasing surface cover using mulch from the shredded bark of sequoia sempervirens or from logging slash did not reduce runoff rates but both types of cover reduced rainsplash and the mulch also reduced sediment delivery by flowing water post fire logging slash placed on bare compacted soil lacked contact with the soil and did not affect interrill or rill sediment delivery rates the potential reduction capacity of adding slash as a post fire logging erosion mitigation practice may increase by either shredding the slash to make the pieces smaller prior to application or by applying the slash before or during the use of heavy machinery so that the slash is better incorporated in the soil declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements this research was carried out in the framework of the research contract cdl cttri 88 arh 2018 ref 138 88 arh

6354,groundwater is a priceless resource in alberta and therefore estimating groundwater are crucial to identifying and promoting holistic and integrated management of groundwater surface water however it is a challenge to simulate groundwater storage due to the current rudimentary representation of two way groundwater surface water exchange in current hydrologic models such as soil and water assessment tool swat which in turn limits our ability to predict land atmosphere processes and groundwater storage in this study we modified the swat model to improve module of evapotranspiration in two way groundwater surface water exchange the modified swat was calibrated and validated against the groundwater table height and evapotranspiration from 2008 to 2011 period at two location lethbridge and barons alberta canada the results showed that the modified swat model predicts the groundwater table height very well at both locations the modified model predicted the daily groundwater table height with r2 values of 0 86 and 0 89 in the calibration period 2008 2009 0 81 and 0 83 for the validation period 2010 2011 at lethbridge and barons respectively the nash sutcliffe model efficiency nse for daily groundwater table height was 0 69 and 0 71 during calibration periods 2008 2009 while the model gives lower values of nse 0 65 and 0 67 for validation periods 2010 2011 at lethbridge and barons respectively similarly the model estimates evapotranspiration well with correlation coefficient r2 of 0 77 during the calibration period and 0 81 for validation period our result showed that the modified swat model did improve estimates to dynamic groundwater table heights keywords groundwater table swat evapotranspiration simulation lethbridge 1 introduction

mäkiranta et al 2018 lauvernet and muñoz carpena 2018 therefore there is a need to assess groundwater storage and vulnerability for sustainable groundwater resource management in lethbridge and barons alberta water table is a main indicator of shallow groundwater storage levels and recharge its oscillation over time is because of interaction between groundwater and surface water which is affected by many factors such as the soil physical and chemical properties rainfalls crop development and agricultural management wada et al 2010 glazer and likens 2012 yang et al 2018 in situ wells for monitoring water tables are common approach for estimating groundwater storage but are very cost at large scale which hinders proper understanding of groundwater dynamics across larger areas in detail therefore many models have been developed to estimate groundwater storage and the underlying water table william 1994 devitt et al 2002 nachabe et al 2005 bhanja et al 2018 ghazavi et al 2018 thompson 2003 kamali and niksokhan 2017 sukop et al 2018 these modeling approaches can be categorized into a statistical regression sukop et al 2018 kamali and niksokhan 2017 b richards equation reimann and hill 2009 pardo igúzquiza et al 2018 c land surface hydrology and earth system models arnold et al 1998 iwema et al 2017 and d integrated models ng et al 2018 chunn et al 2019 statistical regressions are a technique used to determine groundwater storage using monitoring data or remote sensing data from satellite such as gravity recovery and climate experiment grace mission rodell et al 2009 bhanja et al 2018 this approach depends on data availability and therefore has been enhanced by huge data from satellite remote sensing bhanja et al 2018 or artificial intelligence kamali and niksokhan 2017 however this approach is lack of mechanism representations and cannot predict groundwater storage changes the richards equation is widely used physical model to simulate variably saturated and unsaturated water flow in porous media soylu et al 2011 pardo igúzquiza et al 2018 deng and wang 2017 younes et al 2018 its advantage is able to simulate complex groundwater dynamics such as seawater intrusion younes et al 2018 but most of this approach models are lack of representations of land surface information i e vegetation dynamics on the other hand the models of land surface hydrology and earth systems can describe the surface hydrological processes such as river flow rates and vegetation but simplify groundwater modelling for example the soil and water assessment tool swat is a model of land surface hydrological processes for a small watershed to river basin scale model which has been widely used to simulate the quality and quantity of complex surface hydrological processes such as soil erosion prevention and control melaku et al 2018 shrestha and wang 2018a and non point source pollution shrestha and wang 2018b even though land surface hydrologic models are valuable tools for simulating and predicting changes in water dynamics groundwater table is usually difficult to be predicted due to lack of proper representation of evapotranspiration et the integrated models are to combine advantages of groundwater surface water interactions by coupling richards equations and land surface models for example kim and chung 2008 and chunn et al 2019 proposed integrated models of swat modflow in which the characteristics of the hydrologic response unit hru in swat was exchanged with the finite difference grid cells in modflow in this regard the integrated swat modflow does not simultaneously solve surface and subsurface flow equations instead it exchanges data between modflow and swat thus the integrated model requires nearly all the individual input files for each of the two original models modeflow and swat to run the integrated swat modflow the user bears the burden of generating a large number of variously formatted files that correctly correspond and couple with each other ng et al 2018 this may require significant time and computational knowledge and thus restrict their use in many cases further development of these integrated models has been challenging due to the differences of the underlying program structure grid structure languages and input data between the different models therefore the integrated swat modflow by kim and chung 2008 did not consider the influences of the soil water change in the unsaturated zone on evapotranspiration since the swat has insufficient representations of et it has been found that the underlying water table are strongly related to evapotranspiration et william 1994 devitt et al 2002 nachabe et al 2005 as shallow unsaturated soil and deep saturated groundwater are hydrologically connected through the process of et thompson 2003 sukop et al 2018 the strength of these relationships varies with depth to the water table from the land surface roots extract water from the unsaturated zone if the water table is deeper than the root zone and the unsaturated soil zone is then replenished from the groundwater table below jury et al 1991 fan et al 2017 moreover high and low et rates are associated with shallow and deep water tables respectively duell 1990 nichols et al 1994 as a continuous time physically based watershed scale model the swat model arnold et al 1998 arnold and fohrer 2005 zhang et al 2011 has potentials to represent the shallow and deep aquifer hu et al 2010 reshmidevi and kumar 2012 in recent years estimating the groundwater by using swat has been the subject of many studies which offers the advantage of considering spatial variability of influenced factors compared with traditional methods githui et al 2012 perrin et al 2012 awan and ismaeel 2014 although these models have been calibrated by using the observed stream flows or evapotranspiration the verifications of groundwater modeling were still insufficient and much work remains to be done to simulate dynamics of water tables clark et al 2015 as a long term series of groundwater table monitoring data becomes available for the calibration and validation of the model the water table and the water balance equation in each aquifer can be further improved on a daily time step in this study we aim to modify a groundwater module in swat model to represent two way groundwater surface water interactions through considering evapotranspiration the modification of swat improves representation of groundwater surface water interactions for prediction of groundwater table height then we apply it to simulate the dynamics of groundwater table fluctuation at lethbridge and barons alberta and conduct calibration and validation using the daily and monthly observed groundwater tables and to assess groundwater table fluctuation and evapotranspiration for the sustainability of groundwater resources 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study area the study was conducted from 2008 to 2011 at oldman river basin in lethbridge and barons located at 49 38 06 to 49 59 34 n latitude and 112 48 00 to 113 04 47 w longitude respectively and at altitude of 917 m above sea level canada fig 1 the mean annual and growing season air temperatures were 6 2 and 16 2 c respectively and the 30 year mean annual and growing season precipitation were 396 and 206 mm respectively groundwater table data consisting of well records are obtained from the government of alberta environment and parks http environment alberta ca apps gown a 21 03 and 19 81 m wells were dug for groundwater monitoring at lethbridge and barons respectively the evapotranspiration data were obtained from the government of alberta agriculture and forestry https agriculture alberta ca acis session expired jsp observed daily and monthly data from 2008 to 2011 were used for calibration and validation of the model for both locations the data recorded between 2008 and 2009 were used for model calibration and data for the period 2010 2011 were used for model validation for both locations 2 2 swat model the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 is a continuous semi distributed process based watershed scale model the model requires climate data soil land cover and land management data to simulate surface and subsurface hydrology and various chemical nutrient and sediment fluxes swat divides the aquifer system in each hru into two aquifers deep aquifers and shallow aquifers water percolated from vadose zone in partitioned into the shallow and deep aquifer recharges water percolating to deep aquifer is considered as a loss to the system neitsch et al 2011 that makes swat model more flexible to calibrate when there is a substantial amount of groundwater storage in the shallow aquifer water that moves past the lowest depth of the soil profile by percolation flow enters and flows through the vadose zone before becoming shallow and deep aquifer recharge the lag between the time that water exits the soil profile and enters the shallow aquifer depends on the depth to the groundwater table height and the hydraulic properties of the geologic formations in the vadose and groundwater zones swat incorporates a simple conceptual groundwater water table height equation in the original swat the water table height is computed with eq 1 neitsch et al 2002 1 h wt i h wt i 1 e x p α gw δ t w rchrg 1 e x p α gw δ t 800 μ α gw where h wt i is water table height on day i m h wt i 1 is water table height on day i 1 m α gw is base flow recession constant alpha bf δ t time step day w rchrg is amount of recharge entering the aquifer on the day mmh2o μ is specific yield of aquifer gw spyld in m m however eq 1 has not considered the influences of evapotranspiration et on the change of groundwater table height many studies indicated the importance of the et and vegetation in shallow groundwater tables zhang and schilling 2006 fan et al 2014 in periods when the material overlying the aquifer is getting drier water in the capillary fringe that separates the saturated and vandose zones will evaporate and diffuse upward fan et al 2017 as water is removed by evaporation it is replaced by water from the underlying groundwater table water may also be removed by plant roots through transpiration which are able to uptake water directly from the aquifer in this study we modified the groundwater module the swat source code in order to consider effect of evapotranspiration et on the groundwater table height we used the conceptual model of the groundwater recharge and water table proposed by liu and luo 2012 in modifying the swat source code their model reflects the dynamic interaction of soil water groundwater evapotranspiration and soil characteristics the water table height and recharge were calculated as follows 2 h wt i h wt i 1 e x p α gw δ t w rchrg e t 1 e x p α gw δ t 800 μ α gw 3 w rchrg i 1 e x p 1 δ gw w seep e x p 1 δ gw w rchrg i 1 4 w seep w perc w crk where h wt i is water table height on day i m h wt i 1 is water table depth on day i 1 m α gw is base flow recession constant alpha bf δ t time step day w rchrg is amount of recharge entering the aquifer on the day mmh2o μ is specific yield of aquifer gw spyld in m m and et evapotranspiration on a day mm h2o w seep is total amount of water exciting on soil bottom profile mmh2o w perc is groundwater percolation perc in mm and w crk is amount of water flow past the lower boundary furthermore we compare the height differences of water table between two adjacent months the groundwater table fluctuations caused by a non steady state response to groundwater flow to periodic recharge was computed by eq 5 smedema and rycroft 1983 neitsch et al 2011 5 d h wtbl d t w rchrg q gw 800 μ where d h

groundwater flow in the main channel i mm h2o 2 3 model performance evaluation graphical and statistical model evaluation techniques were used to see how well the observed and the simulated groundwater table and evapotranspiration results matched we made use of the swat cup abbaspour et al 2004 abbaspour et al 2007 which is capable of providing multiple model evaluation statistical criteria as an objective function for model calibration and validation the sequential uncertainty fitting 2 sufi 2 of the swat cup was used for model sensitivity analysis calibration and validation the sufi 2 algorithm accounts for different sources of parameter uncertainty conceptual model uncertainty and input data uncertainty gupta et al 2006 in this study the coefficient of determination r2 and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 evaluation statistics were used to assess the goodness of fit of the model moriasi et al 2007 6 r 2 σ i 1 n o i o e i e σ i 1 n o i o 2 σ i 1 i e i e 2 where n is the number of observations or samples oi is observed values ei is estimated values ō is mean of observed values ē is the mean of estimated values i is counter for individual observed and predicted values the r 2 ranges between 0 and 1 where 1 means that the predicted value is equal to the observed value and zero means that there is no correlation between the estimated and observed values 7 nse 1 i 1 n e i o i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 the range of e lies between and 1 0 with e 1 describing a perfect fit values between 0 and 1 0 are generally viewed as acceptable levels of performance whereas values 0 indicate that the mean observed value is a better predictor than the model 3 results 3 1 model sensitivity analysis before calibration and validation processes in swat we first performed a sensitivity analysis to identify the most sensitive parameters it is quite crucial to identify the key parameters and degree of precision required for calibration process arnold et al 2012 the most sensitive parameters for the model are given in table 1 consequently we considered these parameters for model calibration table 2 shows the optimal parameter values used in the calibration processes 3 2 daily groundwater table the modified swat model simulated the daily groundwater table very well with an r2 value of 0 86 during the calibration period 2008 2009 and 0 81 for the validation period 2010 2011 at lethbridge the model also gave good results of nse value 0 69 for calibration and 0 65 for validation periods fig 2 a and b in the figures observed groundwater table fluctuated quite smoothly without sudden decreases or increases indicating that observed groundwater table is correlated with the simulated groundwater table fig 2a shallow groundwater table height was observed during midsummer while deeper groundwater table was observed in the winter this is attributed to higher precipitation during summer season similarly the modified swat model predicted the daily groundwater table with better model fit fig 3 a and b both during the calibration and validation period at barons the model performed very well with an r2 of 0 89 for calibration and 0 83 for model validation at barons in both locations the simulation results depicted that the modified model estimates the groundwater table very well the result of comparing the simulated and observed et values are presented in fig 4 a and b at lethbridge and in fig 5 a and b at barons higher evapotranspiration were recorded from june to august both during the calibration period 2008 209 and during the validation period 2010 2011 where shallow groundwater table height was observed at both locations lethbridge and barons this indicated that during these periods higher evapotranspiration might have a great impact on groundwater table fluctuations even though there was missing observed data from 01 01 2008 to 30 08 2008 the model predicts the evapotranspiration very well with r2 of 0 77 and nse of 0 61 during the calibration period similarly during the validation period the model simulated the evapotranspiration very well r2 0 81 and nse 0 65 3 3 monthly groundwater table the monthly simulated and observed groundwater table results are presented in fig 6 a calibration and fig 6b validation at lethbridge similarly the modified swat model showed good monthly groundwater table prediction results with an r2 value of 0 79 and nse value of 0 71 during calibration and an r2 value of 0 71 and nse value of 0 60 for validation period at lethbridge the calibration results fig 6a showed better model fit than the validation results fig 6b the monthly water table varies approximately from 0 8 m to 1 3 m on the other hand the simulation results at barons also showed better model performance for monthly groundwater table fig 7 a and b the simulation results of modified swat model gave very good model efficiency r2 0 89 during calibration and r2 0 81 the comparison of the observed and the simulated groundwater table results shows that there was a slight over prediction during the validation period in both locations figs 6b and 7b this slight overprediction may attributes that the monthly groundwater takes the daily cumulative average the daily data average captures more higher and lower points than the monthly average 3 4 monthly variation of groundwater table the monthly variation of the groundwater table at lethbridge is shown in fig 8 a and 8b the model performed satisfactorily during the calibration and validation periods both the simulated and observed groundwater fluctuations from month to month shows similar trends the model gives an r2 value of 0 75 and nse value of 0 67 for calibration periods 2008 2009 however the model gives lower results of r2 and nse values for validation period fig 8 similarly the modified swat model predicts the monthly groundwater table variation with a satisfactory model fit at barons fig 9 a and b the calibration and validation results showed good model performance at locations lethbridge and barons according to the 1 1 line fitting diagram figs 10 and 11 the value of r2 coefficient of determination was 0 79 for calibration period and 0 71 validation period and the corresponding nash sutcliffe efficiency nse was 0 71 and 0 60 for calibration and validation respectively at lethbridge the model also gives good model efficiency values both during calibration r2 0 89 and nse 0 68 and validation periods r2 0 81 and nse 0 56 at barons fig 11 in general the modified swat model showed better model performance than the original swat model table 3 based on the comparison results between the modified and the original swat model the modified model results showed relatively better performance in daily water table monthly water table and the monthly water table fluctuation table 3 since evapotranspiration was not included in the original swat model the values are presented only in the modified module 4 discussions the results of the study indicates good correlation between the observed and the swat predicted daily groundwater table throughout the calibration and validation periods 2008 2011 at both locations lethbridge and barons canada the good model calibration and validation results demonstrated that the model could capture the groundwater table fluctuation in the daily observation and simulation periods the modified swat was also efficient for monthly estimation of groundwater table the magnitude of the correlation coefficient indicates the strength of the relationship between the observed and predicted groundwater table in terms of whether they change together or separately and the nash sutcliffe coefficient results of this study explains how far all model predictions were from fit with the reality previous studies have reported similar relationships for the shallow water tables nichols 2000 devitt et al 2002 sophocleous 2002 vazquez amábile and engel 2005 since the original version of swat allows only downward movement of water for calculating groundwater table height we adapted the model in order to represent the upward movements of water through evapotranspiration the results of the study indicates that the modified swat provides better representation of et in the groundwater table estimation higher evapotranspiration et was recorded during midsummer in all simulation seasons 2008 2011 which are associated with shallow groundwater table while lower evapotranspiration rates are associated with deep groundwater tables this indicates that the strength of these relationships varies with depth to the groundwater table from the land surface previous studies described the relationship between et and groundwater table mcdonald and harbaugh 1988 nachabe et al 2005 ndou et al 2017 reported that evapotranspiration occurs where groundwater table is close to the surface our results revealed that higher et was observed at shallow groundwater table this indicates that the variations in the water table depth over time may influence significantly the soil water content in a column due to evapotranspiration evapotranspiration fluxes influence shallow water table by sustaining capillary rise in the capillary fringe yeh and eltahir 2005 kollet and maxwell 2008 miguez macho and fan 2012 as has been numerically observed by other researchers maxwell and kollet 2008 condon et al 2013 maquin et al 2017 other simulations studies reveal that up to 20 of evapotranspiration can be drawn from shallow groundwater york et al 2002 zhang and schilling 2006 also reported that groundwater table is lowered by evapotranspiration our results showed evapotranspiration follows a distinct seasonal cycle with daily evapotranspiration peaking during midsummer and falling to minimum rates in the winter though the daily winter et is less than the summer et it is an important component in the water balance which has an impact in the water table depth fluctuation yan et al 2018 reported that groundwater table was strongly affected by climate factors such as precipitation and evapotranspiration in general the groundwater table rises with precipitation and declines with evapotranspiration yan et al 2018 this indicates that evapotranspiration has a significant contribution for groundwater table in which this factor should be considered in swat modeling as one of the components 5 conclusions water table is a main indicator of shallow groundwater storage levels and recharge its oscillation over time is affected by many factors such as the soil physical and chemical properties rainfalls crop development and agricultural management it is challenging to predict the water tables and groundwater storage using the swat model because of insufficient representation of complex interaction between groundwater and surface water in this study we modified the swat model to better represent two way groundwater surface water interactions through considering evapotranspiration the modified model has been calibrated and validated against the observed data of groundwater tables at lethbridge and barons alberta then we apply it to simulate the dynamics of groundwater table fluctuation and to assess groundwater table fluctuation and evapotranspiration for the sustainability of groundwater resources the simulated results show that the modified swat model performed well in simulating groundwater table at lethbridge and barons alberta the modified swat model showed better model efficiency as compared to the original swat model based on the comparison results between the modified and the original swat model the modified model results showed relatively better performance in daily water table monthly water table and the water table fluctuation at both locations lethbridge and barons this demonstrates that the modified swat model can better represent the hydrological relationship between evapotranspiration and groundwater table fluctuations therefore the modified swat model is capable of simulating groundwater table as a useful tool of estimating groundwater table height and groundwater storage for sustainable management declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements the authors are very grateful to the alberta economic development and trade for the campus alberta innovates program

alberta agriculture and forestry respectively we acknowledge their effort for making the data available to use 
6354,groundwater is a priceless resource in alberta and therefore estimating groundwater are crucial to identifying and promoting holistic and integrated management of groundwater surface water however it is a challenge to simulate groundwater storage due to the current rudimentary representation of two way groundwater surface water exchange in current hydrologic models such as soil and water assessment tool swat which in turn limits our ability to predict land atmosphere processes and groundwater storage in this study we modified the swat model to improve module of evapotranspiration in two way groundwater surface water exchange the modified swat was calibrated and validated against the groundwater table height and evapotranspiration from 2008 to 2011 period at two location lethbridge and barons alberta canada the results showed that the modified swat model predicts the groundwater table height very well at both locations the modified model predicted the daily groundwater table height with r2 values of 0 86 and 0 89 in the calibration period 2008 2009 0 81 and 0 83 for the validation period 2010 2011 at lethbridge and barons respectively the nash sutcliffe model efficiency nse for daily groundwater table height was 0 69 and 0 71 during calibration periods 2008 2009 while the model gives lower values of nse 0 65 and 0 67 for validation periods 2010 2011 at lethbridge and barons respectively similarly the model estimates evapotranspiration well with correlation coefficient r2 of 0 77 during the calibration period and 0 81 for validation period our result showed that the modified swat model did improve estimates to dynamic groundwater table heights keywords groundwater table swat evapotranspiration simulation lethbridge 1 introduction

groundwater module the swat source code in order to consider effect of evapotranspiration et on the groundwater table height we used the conceptual model of the groundwater recharge and water table proposed by liu and luo 2012 in modifying the swat source code their model reflects the dynamic interaction of soil water groundwater evapotranspiration and soil characteristics the water table height and recharge were calculated as follows 2 h wt i h wt i 1 e x p α gw δ t w rchrg e t 1 e x p α gw δ t 800 μ α gw 3 w rchrg i 1 e x p 1 δ gw w seep e x p 1 δ gw w rchrg i 1 4 w seep w perc w crk where h wt i is water table height on day i m h wt i 1 is water table depth on day i 1 m α gw is base flow recession constant alpha bf δ t time step day w rchrg is amount of recharge entering the aquifer on

groundwater flow in the main channel i mm h2o 2 3 model performance evaluation graphical and statistical model evaluation techniques were used to see how well the observed and the simulated groundwater table and evapotranspiration results matched we made use of the swat cup abbaspour et al 2004 abbaspour et al 2007 which is capable of providing multiple model evaluation statistical criteria as an objective function for model calibration and validation the sequential uncertainty fitting 2 sufi 2 of the swat cup was used for model sensitivity analysis calibration and validation the sufi 2 algorithm accounts for different sources of parameter uncertainty conceptual model uncertainty and input data uncertainty gupta et al 2006 in this study the coefficient of determination r2 and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 evaluation statistics were used to assess the goodness of fit of the model moriasi et al 2007 6 r 2 σ i 1 n o i o e i e σ i 1 n o i o 2 σ i 1

performance whereas values 0 indicate that the mean observed value is a better predictor than the model 3 results 3 1 model sensitivity analysis before calibration and validation processes in swat we first performed a sensitivity analysis to identify the most sensitive parameters it is quite crucial to identify the key parameters and degree of precision required for calibration process arnold et al 2012 the most sensitive parameters for the model are given in table 1 consequently we considered these parameters for model calibration table 2 shows the optimal parameter values used in the calibration processes 3 2 daily groundwater table the modified swat model simulated the daily groundwater table very well with an r2 value of 0 86 during the calibration period 2008 2009 and 0 81 for the validation period 2010 2011 at lethbridge the model also gave good results of nse value 0 69 for calibration and 0 65 for validation periods fig 2 a and b in the figures observed groundwater table fluctuated quite smoothly without sudden decreases or increases indicating that observed groundwater table is correlated with the simulated groundwater table fig 2a shallow groundwater table height was observed during midsummer while deeper groundwater table was observed in the winter this is attributed to higher precipitation during summer season similarly the modified swat model predicted the daily groundwater table with better model fit fig 3 a and b both during the calibration and validation period at barons the model performed very well with an r2 of 0 89 for calibration and 0 83 for model validation at barons in both locations the simulation results depicted that the modified model estimates the groundwater table very well the result of comparing the simulated and observed et values are presented in fig 4 a and b at lethbridge and in fig 5 a and b at barons higher evapotranspiration were recorded from june to august both during the calibration period 2008 209 and during the validation period 2010 2011 where shallow groundwater table height was observed at both locations lethbridge and barons this indicated that during these periods higher evapotranspiration might have a great impact on groundwater table fluctuations even though there was missing observed data from 01 01 2008 to 30 08 2008 the model predicts the evapotranspiration very well with r2 of 0 77 and nse of 0 61 during the calibration period similarly during the validation period the model simulated the evapotranspiration very well r2 0 81 and nse 0 65 3 3 monthly groundwater table the monthly simulated and observed groundwater table results are presented in fig 6 a calibration and fig 6b validation at lethbridge similarly the modified swat model showed good monthly groundwater table prediction results with an r2 value of 0 79 and nse value of 0 71 during calibration and an r2 value of 0 71 and nse value of 0 60 for validation period at lethbridge the calibration results fig 6a showed better model fit than the validation results fig 6b the monthly water table varies approximately from 0 8 m to 1 3 m on the other hand the simulation results at barons also showed better model performance for monthly groundwater table fig 7 a and b the simulation results of modified swat model gave very good model efficiency r2 0 89 during calibration and r2 0 81 the comparison of the observed and the simulated groundwater table results shows that there was a slight over prediction during the validation period in both locations figs 6b and 7b this slight overprediction may attributes that the monthly groundwater takes the daily cumulative average the daily data average captures more higher and lower points than the monthly average 3 4 monthly variation of groundwater table the monthly variation of the groundwater table at lethbridge is shown in fig 8 a and 8b the model performed satisfactorily during the calibration and validation periods both the simulated and observed groundwater fluctuations from month to month shows similar trends the model gives an r2 value of 0 75 and nse value of 0 67 for calibration periods 2008 2009 however the model gives lower results of r2 and nse values for validation period fig 8 similarly the modified swat model predicts the monthly groundwater table variation with a satisfactory model fit at barons fig 9 a and b the calibration and validation results showed good model performance at locations lethbridge and barons according to the 1 1 line fitting diagram figs 10 and 11 the value of r2 coefficient of determination was 0 79 for calibration period and 0 71 validation period and the corresponding nash sutcliffe efficiency nse was 0 71 and 0 60 for calibration and validation respectively at lethbridge the model also gives good model efficiency values both during calibration r2 0 89 and nse 0 68 and validation periods r2 0 81 and nse 0 56 at barons fig 11 in general the modified swat model showed better model performance than the original swat model table 3 based on the comparison results between the modified and the original swat model the modified model results showed relatively better performance in daily water table monthly water table and the monthly water table fluctuation table 3 since evapotranspiration was not included in the original swat model the values are presented only in the modified module 4 discussions the results of the study indicates good correlation between the observed and the swat predicted daily groundwater table throughout the calibration and validation periods 2008 2011 at both locations lethbridge and barons canada the good model calibration and validation results demonstrated that the model could capture the groundwater table fluctuation in the daily observation and simulation periods the modified swat was also efficient for monthly estimation of groundwater table the magnitude of the correlation coefficient indicates the strength of the relationship between the observed and predicted groundwater table in terms of whether they change together or separately and the nash sutcliffe coefficient results of this study explains how far all model predictions were from fit with the reality previous studies have reported similar relationships for the shallow water tables nichols 2000 devitt et al 2002 sophocleous 2002 vazquez amábile and engel 2005 since the original version of swat allows only downward movement of water for calculating groundwater table height we adapted the model in order to represent the upward movements of water through evapotranspiration the results of the study indicates that the modified swat provides better representation of et in the groundwater table estimation higher evapotranspiration et was recorded during midsummer in all simulation seasons 2008 2011 which are associated with shallow groundwater table while lower evapotranspiration rates are associated with deep groundwater tables this indicates that the strength of these relationships varies with depth to the groundwater table from the land surface previous studies described the relationship between et and groundwater table mcdonald and harbaugh 1988 nachabe et al 2005 ndou et al 2017 reported that evapotranspiration occurs where groundwater table is close to the surface our results revealed that higher et was observed at shallow groundwater table this indicates that the variations in the water table depth over time may influence significantly the soil water content in a column due to evapotranspiration evapotranspiration fluxes influence shallow water table by sustaining capillary rise in the capillary fringe yeh and eltahir 2005 kollet and maxwell 2008 miguez macho and fan 2012 as has been numerically observed by other researchers maxwell and kollet 2008 condon et al 2013 maquin et al 2017 other simulations studies reveal that up to 20 of evapotranspiration can be drawn from shallow groundwater york et al 2002 zhang and schilling 2006 also reported that groundwater table is lowered by evapotranspiration our results showed evapotranspiration follows a distinct seasonal cycle with daily evapotranspiration peaking during midsummer and falling to minimum rates in the winter though the daily winter et is less than the summer et it is an important component in the water balance which has an impact in the water table depth fluctuation yan et al 2018 reported that groundwater table was strongly affected by climate factors such as precipitation and evapotranspiration in general the groundwater table rises with precipitation and declines with evapotranspiration yan et al 2018 this indicates that evapotranspiration has a significant contribution for groundwater table in which this factor should be considered in swat modeling as one of the components 5 conclusions water table is a main indicator of shallow groundwater storage levels and recharge its oscillation over time is affected by many factors such as the soil physical and chemical properties rainfalls crop development and agricultural management it is challenging to predict the water tables and groundwater storage using the swat model because of insufficient representation of complex interaction between groundwater and surface water in this study we modified the swat model to better represent two way groundwater surface water interactions through considering evapotranspiration the modified model has been calibrated and validated against the observed data of groundwater tables at lethbridge and barons alberta then we apply it to simulate the dynamics of groundwater table fluctuation and to assess groundwater table fluctuation and evapotranspiration for the sustainability of groundwater resources the simulated results show that the modified swat model performed well in simulating groundwater table at lethbridge and barons alberta the modified swat model showed better model efficiency as compared to the original swat model based on the comparison results between the modified and the original swat model the modified model results showed relatively better performance in daily water table monthly water table and the water table fluctuation at both locations lethbridge and barons this demonstrates that the modified swat model can better represent the hydrological relationship between evapotranspiration and groundwater table fluctuations therefore the modified swat model is capable of simulating groundwater table as a useful tool of estimating groundwater table height and groundwater storage for
