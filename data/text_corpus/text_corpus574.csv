2870,the study presents a comprehensive assessment of the key terrestrial water budget twb components and their recent temporal trends using observed and gridded datasets across upper jhelum basin ujb for the period of 2003 2014 different gridded datasets were used for precipitation p aphrodite chirps pgmfd era 5 and mswep evapotranspiration et mod16a2 ssebop gldas noah terraclimate and dolce gravity recovery and climate experiment grace derived terrestrial water storage tws and observed discharge q measurements firstly gridded p and et datasets were assessed through detailed spatiotemporal analysis against reference datasets and considering their adequacy to close the twb the imbalance in twb and associated uncertainties of each component were also computed to understand the potential of gridded datasets for water budget studies finally twb components were subjected to trend analysis to evaluate temporal trends and their statistical significance over the study period overall era5 pand dolce et relatively performed better and hence considered to be the most appropriate to present the hydrological spatiotemporal variability across ujb the imbalance in water budget was mainly associated with higher uncertainties in p especially during wet periods the results of temporal trend analysis showed a insignificant mixed trends for annual p with increase and decrease in monsoon and winter p respectively b mixed yet statistically significant trends for et in different parts of basin at annual and seasonal scale c significant decreasing trends for tws throughout the ujb in winter and annual scale d increasing trends for q in all months of the year except january and february despite the imbalance in water budget estimation due to large uncertainties in gridded p et and tws datasets the study underlines the important information about twb dynamics and their spatiotemporal variability over ujb which can be used as the knowledge base for further impact assessment studies keywords precipitation evapotranspiration terrestrial water storage change water balance dynamics uncertainty data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction knowledge of the terrestrial water budget twb components and their dynamics over large spatial scale are crucial to understand the water resources availability and management the potential risk of hydro hazards floods and droughts and the interactions of the land surface with the atmosphere under a changing environment overall the ground based measurement of twb components over large spatial scale has long been a challenge around the world primarily owing to limited and inconsistent measurement networks and their intrinsic inaccuracies particularly in mountainous environment like the upper jhelum basin ujb 33467 km2 where complex climatic and terrain conditions prevail franchito et al 2009 in addition the data scarcity for the transboundary river basins may increase due to political issues among the sharing countries the aforementioned issues motivate practicing hydrologists to look beyond the available ground measurements for alternative data sources providing continuous estimates of twb components in space and time in this context the regional global gridded datasets based on observations reanalysis and satellite remote sensing are unique in their ability to capture spatiotemporal estimates of twb components at different spatial and temporal resolutions with the potential to provide data for regions with low density in situ measurements around the globe moreira et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 oliveira et al 2014 to date several gridded precipitation p and evapotranspiration et datasets are available in near real time with quasi global to global coverage the use of these datasets to study twb components however is not straightforward as no single gridded dataset can be said to be perfect for all conditions in fact different datasets of the same geophysical variable can include errors and uncertainties particularly at higher altitudes where sources and magnitudes of the variable exhibit large variability leading to inconsistency between estimates of the same variable pellet et al 2020 these errors and uncertainties could be associated with the way they are developed and or the lack of calibrated ground observations in remote areas jia et al 2012 thiemig et al 2013 therefore a comprehensive performance assessment of these gridded p and et datasets for the area of interest is necessary before their subsequent use in any studies research conducted in different regions of the world has shown that the performance of these p and et gridded datasets could vary from region to region omonge et al 2022 moreira et al 2019 baudouin et al 2020 motta et al 2019 mccabe et al 2016 michel et al 2016 xie et al 2019 over high mountains of asia hma various studies investigated the performance of different p gridded datasets from reanalysis models and remote sensing andermann et al 2011 hu et al 2016 palazzi et al 2013 you et al 2015 for example ma et al 2009 and you et al 2015 evaluated few atmospheric reanalysis p datasets in tibetan plateau and found large negative biases in these datasets though the gauge based datasets such as asian precipitation highly resolved observational data integration toward evaluation aphrodite have a better match with in situ observation they feature p under catch at higher altitudes which significantly impact the p trends and quality andermann et al 2011 hu et al 2016 immerzeel et al 2015 the research conducted on upper indus basin uib by immerzeel et al 2015 also stated that aphrodite underestimates the p for snow and glacier fed basins the errors and uncertainties in the satellite based datasets are attributed to photon scattering associated with terrestrial snow cover you et al 2015 for instance the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm has been found to reproduce rainfall well in wet regions and in warm seasons in east asia shen et al 2010 but the dataset largely overestimates extreme rainfall in south asia hu et al 2016 these studies in general endorse the biases and uncertainties in existing gridded p datasets especially over the himalayas mountain ranges in addition to gridded p datasets hundreds of et algorithms have been developed since 1970 s and the availability of the global scale et datasets has increased some reviews of et algorithms from earth observation data can be found in kalma et al 2008 karimi and bastiaanssen 2015 wang and dickinson 2012 like p gridded et datasets are also subjected to discrepancies due to deficiencies in the model structure input datasets and model parameter related errors scale expansion problems and limited flux tower data for validation jia et al 2012 xia et al 2015a the previous studies of the comparison of gridded et datasets in different regions of the world motta et al 2019 mccabe et al 2016 michel et al 2016 generally concluded that variations among et datasets can lead to significantly different estimates of annual runoff water storage change and irrigation requirements demanding for a thorough evaluation of the available datasets for the study area the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace and its successor grace follow on grace fo tapley et al 2004 are an active remote sensing rs satellite it measures change in mass gravity field variation over large spatial scale to infer vertically integrated estimates of terrestrial water storage tws at the monthly basis the tws from both grace and grace fo missions includes all terms of storage on the land surface glacier snowpack vegetation canopy lakes wetlands rivers etc and subsurface soil moisture groundwater many researchers integrate grace observations with hydrological data from variety of sources including global land data assimilation system gldas models rodell et al 2004 in situ measurements and rs data to provide improved descriptions of water fluxes such as groundwater storage changes gwsc scanlon et al 2012a surface water consumption anderson et al 2012 regional flood potential long et al 2014b reager and famiglietti 2009 drought monitoring long et al 2014b sun et al 2018 reservoir storage changes yi et al 2017 ice mass loss sasgen et al 2010 and water budget closure lv et al 2017 pellet et al 2020 sheffield et al 2009 these studies concluded that grace data can well monitor the variations in terrestrial water storage initially grace data applications are limited to large basins with drainage area of more than 200 000 km2 due to its coarse spatial resolution 4 and higher potential of errors for small basins lower signal to noise ratio however the finer spatial resolution of grace mascon solutions in release 6 rl06 makes it applications possible for small basin studies moreover grace observation is sensitive to total mass changes concentrated within a smaller area if the magnitude is sufficient longuevergne et al 2013 scanlon et al 2012b scanlon et al 2016 abou zaki et al 2019 monitored depletion in ground water storages from grace observations in bakhtegan catchment 31511 km2 iran and found good agreement between grace derived ground water storage change and observations at wells similarly ouma et al 2015 found consistent and close correlation between grace derived twsc and observed gwsc in the nzoia river basin 12709 km2 in kenya further application of grace data for smaller basins can be found in the following studies becker et al 2010 swenson and wahr 2009 wang et al 2011 understanding the origin of uncertainties in gridded datasets and their spatial variability is another critical issue that deserves comprehensive study investigation of the errors that can exist in these datasets is important for achieving future water cycle observation missions with fewer errors regarding water balance closure gao et al 2010 sahoo et al 2011 penatti et al 2015 the current study is conducted keeping in mind the hydrological applications to create awareness about uncertainties and biases in gridded p et and tws datasets over transboundary ujb located at the foothills of western himalayas a most affected mountainous range by climate change the region already witnessed an increase in extreme hydro meteorological extreme events in the last few decades ansari et al 2022 and are expected to become even more pronounced in the coming future pachauri et al 2014 in this context twb components estimations from gridded datasets become important tools for comprehensively understanding the water dynamics in the region although a number of studies have already been conducted on the performance evaluation of gridded p datasets and their associated uncertainties however the et component has received less attention and remains unexplored as far as the grace satellite tws is concerned the coarse spatial resolution 1 of spherical harmonics sh solutions restricts its application in hydrological studies over ujb with the improvement in spatial resolution of grace mascon solution in rl06 grace data can be used also for small basin e g area less than 200 000 km2 studies the same goes for the trend analysis which have been carried out only for essential climatic variables e g p and temperature saddique et al 2020a shafiq et al 2020 in this regard the current study is the first attempt to evaluate a number of gridded p et and tws datasets for water balance studies over ujb the uncertainties in these gridded datasets are firstly evaluated against direct comparison with observed gauge data at monthly seasonal and annual scale and subsequently their abilities are assessed in terms of water budget closure finally trend analysis is carried out for each twb component with a more accurate and reliable gridded p et tws and observed discharge q to check its statistical significance for the period 2003 2014 2 study area the jhelum river is one of the main tributaries of indus river contributing 16 1 of its mean annual flow mahmood and jia 2016 the jhelum river feeds the second largest reservoir of pakistan mangla reservoir which is mainly used to irrigate the downstream floodplains of pakistan s punjab province about six million hectares the water for irrigation purposes is mainly released through power tunnel with power generation as the secondary objective the mangla dam has a hydro power generation capacity of about 1310 mw accounting for 6 of total country power generation from all sources and 15 of hydroelectric power archer and fowler 2004 the mangla watershed or ujb is the catchment area of the jhelum river upstream of the mangla dam it extends from latitudes of 33 00 ʹ n 35 12ʹ n and longitudes of 73 07ʹ e 75 40ʹ e fig 1 a it covers an area of about 33 467 km2 and its elevation ranges from 223 m to 6201 m above mean sea level msl the ujb hosts pir panjal and western himalaya mountainous ranges in the east and northwest of the basin according to the randolph glacier inventory rgi 6 0 consortium 2017 approximately 0 75 252 km2 of the ujb is covered by perennial glaciers the hypsometric curve glaciated area and the climatic stations elevation range is shown in fig 1b the hydro climatology of ujb is strongly governed by two distinct p systems western disturbances and monsoon dominated in north western and southern parts of the basin respectively the mean annual p ranges from 805 mm at pir chinasi 2875 m msl to 1926 mm at narran 2419 m msl while the mean annual minimum and maximum temperature varies from 1 26 c at narran 2419 m msl to 30 20 c at mangla 265 m msl station table 1 lists the climatic stations within and adjacent to ujb as well as their characteristics the basin is imperilled by dual data scarcity issues first trans boundary catchment with 56 18 966 km2 of its area situated in india second limited spatial distribution and low density climatic stations network mostly located in low altitudes less than 2800 m msl the mean annual flow 823 30 m3 s draining into mangla reservoir at the outlet of ujb is a combination of immediate flow generated by rainfall in the low altitude part of the basin and delayed runoff generated by snow and glacier melt from the high altitude part of the basin these flows are essential and primary source of irrigation for the downstream flood plains 3 datasets 3 1 reference p and et data ideally the in situ data from well distributed measurement networks are a good reference to assess the performance of the global gridded p and et datasets at basin scale in case of ujb which is subject to dual data scarcity issue i e low density unevenly distributed network lying at low altitudes and transboundary river basin the limited availability of observed data at least helps the researchers to know the varying range of performances of the global datasets and their spatiotemporal distribution at basin scale in this study the observed daily p and temperature data from seventeen climatic stations located within political boundary of pakistan were used as a reference dataset these stations are operated and maintained by the pakistan meteorological department pmd and water and power development authority wapda of pakistan for the indian side region indian meteorological department imd daily gridded p and temperature datasets derived from a dense network of meteorological stations for the indian mainland pai et al 2014 were extracted at the five stations and used as a reference data for that region the detailed summary of these stations is given in table 1 regarding et different methods are available for its computation either direct or indirect since there is not a single flux tower et measurement in the studied region the reference data for actual et hereafter referred as evapotranspiration et was calculated using an indirect method indirect et estimation from twb equation depends on the accuracy of other hydrological variables for example precipitation runoff and total water storage change as there are few precipitation stations constrained by uneven distribution at low altitudes therefore this approach can provide uncertain estimates another indirect et estimation makes combined use of rs based vegetation indices vis and in situ or remotely sensed meteorological data this method has been widely used for the estimation of actual evapotranspiration and crop water use efficiency this hybrid approach used vegetation fractional cover fc amin et al 2020 johnson and trout 2012 trout et al 2008 glenn et al 2010 verger et al 2009 and crop coefficient kc derived from remotely sensed vis pôças et al 2020 calera et al 2017 kamble et al 2013 jayanthi et al 2007 along with reference evapotranspiration eto or potential evapotranspiration pet for the estimation of actual evapotranspiration crop coefficients kc primarily depends on the dynamics of canopies cover fraction lai greenness since satellite data can help to estimate some key variables related to vegetation phenology myneni et al 1997 duchemin et al 1999 gutman 1999 bastiaanssen et al 2000 they offer opportunities for monitoring the space and time variability of kc the method is similar to et eto kc where kc is the function of vi kc obtained from vis are more robust than conventional kc values since they estimate current vegetation conditions in space and time maselli et al 2014 marcial pablo et al 2021 kullberg et al 2017 in present study green vegetation fraction based kc values were used along with pet to calculate et since green vegetation fraction is a scalar value for multiplication by pet it is functionally the same as a crop coefficient allen et al 1998a groeneveld and baugh 2007 groeneveld et al 2007 the pet was calculated using hargreaves 1994 equation due to data limitation the present study used maximum green vegetation fraction a global dataset spatial resolution 1 km derived from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis ndvi broxton et al 2014 3 2 gridded precipitation datasets five different gridded p datasets i e aphrodite chirps pgmfd era 5 and mswep were evaluated against reference data at monthly seasonal and annual scale these datasets can be distinguished by the way they assimilate observations and produce distributed p fields table 2 offers a brief overview of the chosen datasets the asian precipitation highly resolved observational data integration toward evaluation aphrodite is based on a dense network of up to 8000 daily rain gauge data for monsoon asia region with spatial resolution 0 25 0 25 provided by data integration and analysis system dias japan yatagai et al 2012 the climate hazards group infrared precipitation with stations chirps dataset is developed by climate hazards group chg and the united states geological survey usgs which has a spatial resolution of 0 05 and temporal resolution at daily and monthly scale it was developed with combined use of ground based gauge measurements and cold cloud duration measurement by the synergistic use of satellite thermal infrared band funk et al 2015 the princeton global meteorological forcing dataset for land surface modelling pgmfd sheffield et al 2009 was developed by terrestrial hydrology group at princeton university and is based on the observed and ncep ncar reanalysis i data the dataset is currently available at 1 0 plus 0 5 and 0 25 3 hourly plus daily and monthly resolution globally for 1961 2016 the era5 a relatively new reanalysis data launched by european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf hersbach et al 2020 the data is developed by using advanced 4dvar assimilation scheme and provide various atmospheric variables at 139 pressure levels for 1979 present time period the multi source weighted ensemble precipitation mswep isanew global historic p dataset 1979 2017 developed by merging 18p datasets at a3 hourly temporal and 0 1 spatial resolution beck et al 2017 beck et al 2019 it takes advantage of the complementary strengths of in situ measurements satellites observations and reanalysis data and validated at global scale using observations from 70 000 discharge gauges and hydrological modelling for 9000 catchments with daily gauge corrections 3 3 gridded evapotranspiration datasets et estimations from five global datasets mod16a2 ssebop gldas noah terraclimate and dolce were evaluated against the reference et data these datasets differ in their input data source and production mechanism table 3 gives a brief summary of the selected datasets the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer product mod16a2 is a widely used global terrestrial et dataset that has been computed using an algorithm proposed by mu et al 2011 which employs the logic of the penman monteith equation monteith 1965 the input parameters includes the daily meteorological reanalysis data of the global modelling and assimilation office gmao hu et al 2015 along with modis remotely sensed data products the land surface models lsms in the global land data assimilation system 2 1 gldas 2 1 such as noah ek et al 2003 produce optimal fields of the terrestrial water andenergy fluxesthrough the combined use of ground based observations remote sensing and modelled datasets this dataset is available at a spatial resolution of 0 25 and 1 0 and temporal resolution of 3 h and monthly the operational simplified surface energy balance ssebop et dataset was generated using single source energy balance model senay et al 2013 the algorithm integrates the standardized version of penman monteith equation allen et al 1998b and et fractions generated from remotely sensed modis thermal imagery using a thermal index approach to account the topographical impacts on surface temperature the derived optimal linear combination evapotranspiration dolce is a new hybrid et dataset derived by merging eleven available global et datasets the contribution of each merging dataset to dolce is defined by its ability to represent ground et measurements at 260 sites as well as its dependence on the other parent datasets hobeichi et al 2018 terraclimate et is estimated using a one dimensional modified thornthwaite mather climatic water balance model abatzoglou et al 2018 inputs for the water balance calculation include p reference et and satellite derived plant extractable soil water capacity at 0 5 resolution wang erlandsson et al 2016 3 4 grace data the grace derived total water storage anomaly twsa data from two institutes center for space research csr and jet propulsion laboratory jpl of released 6 rl06 mascon mass concentration solutions were used in this study save et al 2016 the mascon solutions are available at a spatial resolution of 0 25 and 0 5 in cm of equivalent water height for csr and jpl respectively the two mascon solutions via derived twsa differ slightly due to different approaches for the application of spatiotemporal constraints and scale of the grid cells https grace jpl nasa gov data choosing a solution table 4 gives a brief overview of the used datasets the few missing months in grace data are due to battery management these missing epochs were filled by linear interpolation from the previous and following months of the missing data this method was considered as rational because it keeps a good seasonal cycle at the monthly temporal resolution long et al 2014a sheffield et al 2009 in this study grace mascon solutions were preferred instead of spherical harmonic sh solutions due to two reasons firstly the finer spatial resolution and secondly reduced leakage from land to ocean and application of geophysical data constraints during processing with little empirical post processing requirements pellet et al 2020 3 5 in situ river discharge data the daily flow at mangla station outlet of ujb were obtained from surface water hydrology project of wapda pakistan for the period of 2003 2014 from daily data monthly aggregates of flow were calculated and converted to water depth mm to keep compatible with the other components in water budget equation 4 methods 4 1 performance evaluation of gridded p and et datasets the performance of gridded p and et datasets were evaluated against the reference data for a period of twelve years 2003 2014 at monthly seasonal and annual scale the lower and upper limit of the study period was limited by the availability of grace data and consistent and complete records of reference data respectively the evaluation was made on station basis to avoid the uncertainties and errors induced by conversion of observed point data to gridded format and spatial scale matching hu et al 2016 the spatial discrepancies among gridded datasets and reference data were assessed by visualization the disparities in time series were analysed via the taylor diagram which incorporate correlation coefficient r normalized standard deviation nsd and centred root mean square error crmse 4 2 twb dynamics and uncertainty characterization the equation 1 presents the simplified form of water budget based on the principle of mass conservation the equation was used to analyse the twb dynamics at monthly time step over ujb the twsc was calculated as a residual of equation 1 using observed and gridded datasets and compared with grace mascon derived twsc as grace provides mass anomalies of tws at irregular space intervals the storage changes were calculated by the simple difference time derivative of tws anomalies as presented in equation 1 difference between two sub sequent time steps of the grace data representing the average variation of the tws 1 δ s δ t δ t w s δ t tws t 1 tws t δ t where δs δt is terrestrial water storage change for month t tws t 1 and tws t are terrestrial water storage anomalies for month t 1 and t respectively in agreement with moreira et al 2019 rodell et al 2004 sheffield et al 2009 monthly averages between two time steps of p et and q variables were used to make these components comparable with the tws change equation 2 2 δ s δ t p t 1 p t 2 et t 1 et t 2 q t 1 q t 2 here subscripts t 1 and t denotes the month of the respective variable the uncertainty analysis was conducted on the basis of the principle of gaussian error propagation since the present study used observed discharge data which is relatively more accurate than gridded datasets therefore uncertainties contributions of these gridded twb components towards discharge were calculated as one standard deviation via the principle of gaussian error propagation assuming that the components are independent of each other no covariance between any two components long et al 2014a lv et al 2017 sheffield et al 2009 the assumption makes it simpler to calculate the uncertainty contribution of each component separately this approach is particularly useful when the error in the input data is known in fact it has been applied in numerous hydrological studies that use rs data for water balance analysis and produce reliable estimates long et al 2014a lv et al 2017 therefore the uncertainty of total basin q σq is computed as follows 3 σ q σ p 2 σ et 2 σ twsc 2 where σp σet σtwsc are the uncertainty in monthly p et and twsc respectively the uncertainty in p and et were estimated as the standard deviation σ of the observed and selected gridded p and et datasets at each station the uncertainties of these stations were then averaged to calculate basin level uncertainties the uncertainty of jpl m derived twsa can be calculated from the original grace data and are available at http grace jpl nasa gov while a rigorous uncertainty analysis of csr m is still in progress https www2 csr utexas edu grace rl05 mascons html therefore the method described by scanlon et al 2016 wahr et al 2006 was used to calculate the uncertainties in csr m the method involves the calculation of uncertainties from the residuals after decomposition of the time series into long term trends and inter annual annual and semi annual amplitudes as presented in equation 4 the detailed description of the method can be found in scanlon et al 2016 wahr et al 2006 4 s total s long t e r m s annual s semiannual r e s i d u a l inter annual signals were estimated by fitting 13 month moving averages to the residuals in equation 4 the root mean square rms of the residual approximates the measurement uncertainty in csr m because of the high grid resolution of csr m 0 25 leakage errors were assumed to be negligible and were neglected 4 3 trend analysis the annual and seasonal trends in each twb components were analyzed for each pixel using the robust nonparametric regression techniques mann kendall mk test kendall 1948 mann 1945 in conjunction with theil sen theil 1950 estimates at 0 05 and 0 1 significance level 95 and 90 confidence level the mk test was carried out using r package modifiedmk after removing lag one serial correlation if present for this purpose trend free pre whitening tfpw method was employed on serially correlated time series before trend analysis the mk test results were used to create trends maps using arcgis 10 1 software 5 results discussion 5 1 comparison and performance evaluation of gridded precipitation datasets the spatiotemporal comparison of selected gridded p datasets against reference dataset was carried out at monthly seasonal and annual scale employed over the twelve years of period 2003 2014 the basin average reference p was estimated through interpolation of unevenly distributed twenty two meteorological stations mostly installed at low elevation areas considering topography as a predictor known as kriging with external drift ked goovaerts 2000 to check the robustness of the interpolated precipitation cross validation has been applied to annual reference precipitation by the leave one out approach cross validation is a common method for validating the accuracy of interpolation techniques voltz and webster 1990 in this technique information regarding one point is removed temporarily the removed information is estimated from the remaining data points and the difference between the actual and estimated values is calculated this operation is repeated for the remainder of the points one objection to using cross validation is that the whole data sample is often used to define the interpolation model and that the validation therefore might be considered not to be totally independent tveito et al 2008 in order to avoid the limitation of using cross validation an independent validation procedure was used that consists of splitting the data sample into two parts hence 18 stations were used for interpolation purposes while the remaining 4 stations were used for independent validation this procedure is repeated three times with different combinations as shown in fig s1 the results show that the rmse is higher when one station at high altitude gulmarg at 2705 m is taken out for validation purposes overall the rmse range between 51 83 and 64 80 mm year rata et al 2020 compared three interpolation methods for mean annual rainfall in the cheliff watershed algeria and found rmse 49 5 54 0 and 61 4 mm year for ked regression kriging and ordinary kriging respectively borges et al 2016 also found rmse in the range of 50 12 70 35 mm year for different interpolation methods in distrito federal brazil although the accuracy of interpolation methods depends on the geographical location and the density of measurement station network as evident in our study however these studies showed better results of ked for annual precipitation and comparable errors the average annual and seasonal spatial distribution of reference and gridded p datasets are shown in fig 2 the spatial distribution shows that the average annual reference p was highest over the northwest of the ujb snow fed sub basin and or high altitude areas and the lowest annual p was observed in kashmir valley and the southern part of the basin low altitude areas the significant uncertainties in the spatial distribution of mean annual p of the selected gridded p datasets was observed against reference dataset the spatial patterns of mswep and era5 were somewhat similar but overestimated to reference data the pgmfd presents the worst performance in terms of spatial distribution at annual scale at seasonal scale overall reference and all selected gridded p datasets showed higher p over northern part of the ujb in all seasons except summer season in which the highest p was received over southern part of the basin in the form of monsoon rainfall in winter and spring seasons a clear distinctive divide line himalayas divide line in the middle of the ujb at pir panjal mountainous range was seen in reference dataset restricting the downward penetration of westerlies p however the effect of westerlies p was dominated in the surrounding downward regions of the divide line in winter season in summer season southwest part of the basin received highest p the least influence of southwest monsoon was observed in kashmir valley which is encapsulated between two mountain ranges the pir panjal mountains acts as a barrier in the way of monsoonal winds transported from the indian ocean however the valley experiences the influence of monsoon during late summer with typically low magnitude and intensity sen et al 2017 the similar spatial pattern was captured with mswep and era5 datasets the pgmfd aphrodite and chirps were unable to perform good in all seasons the average annual reference p was 1150 mm year over the entire ujb however mean annual p varied widely between the reference and gridded p datasets fig 3 a among all gridded datasets era5 and pgmfd showed the highest and lowest mean annual p in ujb the era5 and mswep overestimated mean annual p by 37 and 14 comparative to reference data respectively on the other side aphrodite chirps and pgmfd underestimated the mean annual p by 5 15 and 28 comparative to reference data respectively the seasonal distribution of p showed a little variation among reference and gridded p datasets except chirps and pgmfd fig 3b the autumn season contributed the least to annual p among all seasons for all datasets the combined contribution of winter and spring p to annual p was more than 50 for all datasets except chirps and pgmfd which showed larger contribution of summer season p monthly p distribution for reference and gridded p datasets are shown in fig 3c overall all datasets present more or less bimodal regime of p with peaks in february and end of july highlighting the dominance of westerlies and monsoon p respectively the northern and eastern parts of the ujb lie in himalayas and pir panjal ranges and receive more than 50 of its annual p in the winter and spring seasons as a result of westerlies regime the second peak in july is the result of summer monsoon prevailing in the southern part of the basin the shape of the second peak of all gridded datasets varied from reference data which showed a slight declining plateau from mid of july to end of august a similar but fairly stable plateau was captured by chirps dataset from mid of july to mid of september in addition era5 and aphrodite datasets produced slightly higher peaks in spring season whereas pgmfd mswep and chirps datasets generates higher peaks in summer monsoon season the temporal disparities in gridded p datasets against reference data were evaluated on station basis a taylor diagram fig 3d summarizes the main statistical metrics nsd r crmse at monthly seasonal and annual scale the proximity of gridded datasets to reference data indicates a good performance the colors in fig 3d represent the different gridded datasets and the shape represents the temporal scale at which comparison was made the performance of all gridded p datasets was relatively better at monthly time scale while it was found to be worst at annual scale except pgmfd which showed a relatively better correlation coefficient r 0 5 overall era5 relatively outperformed over other datasets at monthly and seasonal scale r 0 7 0 8 crmse 0 6 0 7 normalized standard deviation 09 1 0 regarding the selection of suitable gridded p dataset for ujb one also need to consider the uncertainties in reference dataset despite of considering the effect of local topography in interpolation the basin average p estimates still have uncertainties due to low density station network contrasting reviews are reported in literature about the performance of ked technique for p for instance masson and frei 2014 reported considerable improvement in interpolation accuracy with ked compared to other linear regressions without any predictor in high mountainous regions on the other hand berndt and haberlandt 2018 ly et al 2011 argue that topographical impact was indispensable for only temperature reconstruction at all temporal resolutions and station densities but it was less clear for daily to monthly p furthermore all spatial interpolation techniques can perform poorly in regions with insufficient high elevation data due to inaccurate estimation of local lapse rates ruelland 2020 considering all above reviews it can be concluded that the basin average observed p estimates are underestimated owing to the under catch p and unevenly distributed low density approx 1 gauge 2235 km2 climate station network especially at high altitude areas which are the main active parts of the basins azmat 2015 grossi et al 2017 ranzi et al 2003 winiger et al 2005 moreover the p increases with elevation up to 4500 m in himalaya mountainous range and then start to decrease immerzeel et al 2015 whereas the climatic stations are installed up to 3000 m elevation for this reason gridded datasets have been used across a wide range of hydrological modeling research around the world these gridded datasets have substantial differences with reference as well as among themselves figs 2 3 and these differences are mostly due to the deficiencies in their data sources and generation mechanisms overall the performance of era5 dataset was considered to be best with higher correlation even though it overestimates the reference p especially during wet months fig 3a and 3c the pgmfd and chirps datasets have been found highly underestimated and unable to capture spatial patterns when compared to the reference p the aphrodite and mswep both perform well in terms of magnitude and capture the monthly and seasonal p cycle fig 3a 3c however aphrodite underestimate the basin average p like reference p various authors also reported the underestimation of aphrodite over high mountains of asia the meteorological stations used to produce aphrodite dataset yatagai et al 2012 are probably located at lower elevations and cannot represent the high altitude p the underlying explanation for aphrodite chirps underestimation is that the low altitude measurement network and satellite based estimates only observe liquid p whereas era5 estimates both liquid and solid p immerzeel et al 2015 shafeeque et al 2019 moreover era5 is built on a data assimilation scheme and the ecmwf ifs forecast model which includes fully coupled components for atmosphere land surface and ocean waves with closure of atmospheric water balance copernicus 2019 our selection of era5 for ujb was supported by baudouin et al 2020 who cross validated 20 gridded p datasets across indus river and suggested that era5 provides better p estimates in terms of magnitude temporal distribution and variability from daily to multi annual scale immerzeel et al 2015 corrected the aphrodite p data based on glacier mass balance over uib from 1998 to 2007 and found it very close to era interim the third generation of ecmwf which is replaced by fifth generation reanalysis era5 with improved parameterizations and higher resolution nogueira 2020 5 2 comparison and performance evaluation of gridded evapotranspiration datasets the spatiotemporal comparison of gridded et datasets against reference dataset were conducted at monthly seasonal and annual scale the annual and seasonal spatial distribution of reference and gridded et datasets averaged over twelve years of period 2003 2014 are presented in fig 4 as compared to p larger discrepancies were observed among et datasets in terms of magnitude as well as spatial distribution at annual scale the land use land cover lulc maps for the starting and ending year of the study period are shown in fig 5 to explain the spatial distribution of et with reference to lulc because of its direct association with et the lulc was classified into seven classes including agriculture forest grass water bodies permanent snow and ice built up lands and barren land the grass forest and agriculture are three major lulc dominating over high mid and low elevation areas respectively permanent snow and ice covered a negligible area in the northwest of the basin whereas the mangla reservoir can be seen in the south of the basin in the water body class the barren land can be observed within the densely grassy mountains of western himalaya and pir panjal the urban settlement class was concentrated in the kashmir valley major lulc changes from 2003 to 2014 can be observed in agriculture decrease and forest increase class the change was prominent in kashmir valley where afforestation replaced the agricultural land concerning spatial distribution at annual scale the reference et dataset shows a decrease in et rates with increase in elevation the highest et rates of reference dataset can be observed in kashmir valley and southern part of the basin which correspond to the agricultural land fig 5 the part of the basin which hosts western himalaya shows the lowest et rates the pir panjal mountains show higher et rates as compared to western himalaya the difference in et rates despite of the same land cover densely grassed area with small patches of barren land is due to the temperature difference corresponding to different elevation moreover et at high elevation mountainous regions of himalaya only plays a minor role in overall water budget and is generally less than 10 of total hydrological budget bookhagen 2010 khan and koch 2018 this also applies to ujb where only lower altitude areas have higher et contribution while the high elevation sub catchments have only minor annual et due to their low average temperatures the spatial inhomogeneity of et among the forest grass and agricultural land covers were caused by the spatial inhomogeneous soil water content under these land covers the spatial inhomogeneity of et over cultivated land could be a potential indicator of making reasonable and effective irrigation schedule for different crops on the farmland regarding the spatial distribution of gridded datasets ssebop spatial patterns were somewhat similar yet overestimated the reference dataset the mod16a2 and terraclimate datasets present contrasting spatial patterns with higher et rates at higher elevation and vice versa among all et datasets the dolce reasonably well captures the magnitude as well as the spatial distribution at annual scale however it is unable to reproduce higher et rates of kashmir valley encapsulated between two mountainous series similarly at seasonal scale the ssebop dataset shows higher ability to present spatial patterns with overestimation in all seasons except winter where et rates are underestimated apart from autumn season performance of dolce dataset is better than other gridded datasets in terms of magnitude and spatial patterns the average annual reference et for the period 2003 2014 was 550 mm year over entire ujb fig 6 a the gldas noah and mod16a2 showed higher discrepancies with 33 and 27 positive and negative biases respectively the other three datasets dolce ssebop terraclimate performed better with biases in the range of 7 6 12 6 for seasonal distribution in terms of magnitude et datasets show less consistency fig 6b than the p datasets fig 3b especially for winter season the summer season contributes for the largest part to annual et due to availability of sufficient energy and moisture in the form of temperature and monsoon p respectively the contribution of spring season to annual et reduces slightly due to slight reduction in energy availability for extraction of water from water bodies and soil moisture in comparison the seasonal distribution of terraclimate dolce and gldas noah are similar to the reference et dataset fig 6b similarly temporal distribution of reference and all gridded et datasets vary in terms of monthly evolution and magnitude as shown in fig 6c generally all datasets perform better in relatively cold months from november to february than warm months from april to september moreover all datasets underestimate et at the lower end winter months but overestimate et at the higher end summer season except mod16a2 which underestimates et at both the low and high ends fig 6c the terraclimate and dolce datasets show similar evolution of et as reference with one month delayed in peak values mod16a2 shows the largest discrepancy with reference et in terms of temporal distribution and magnitude mostly dampens monthly variations with underestimation of et ranges by approximately 70 the statistical error metrics for et gridded datasets are presented via taylor diagram fig 6d the colors in fig 6d represent the different gridded datasets and the shape represents the temporal scale at which comparison was made at monthly and seasonal scale all datasets relatively perform well except mod16a2 whereas none of the gridded datasets is able to develop a good correlation at annual scale the dolce outperformed over other datasets with r 0 78 0 79 crmse 0 75 0 8 and nsd 1 25 at a temporal resolution of month and season the ssebop dataset was well correlated with reference dataset r 0 82 0 86 but has higher crmse and nsd et across ujb varies in response to atmospheric forcing and moisture availability on snow and earth surfaces the direct estimation of et over mountainous regions like north part of ujb is complicated due to the absence of ground stations at high altitudes and high topographic heterogeneity for the same reason absolute et estimates are very few and highly uncertain despite of its crucial importance in twb cycle an indirect approach of estimating et as a residual of twb equation has also been applied to alpine high altitude regions builes jaramillo and poveda 2018 li et al 2019 however the reliability of et estimated from twb equation depends on the accuracy of other hydrological variables for example p runoff and total water storage change as there are few p stations constrained by uneven distribution at low altitudes therefore this approach can provide highly uncertain estimates in this study a hybrid approach integrating ground based measurement with rs based vegetation indices was used to estimate et this approach has been widely used for the estimation of et at large scale bryla et al 2010 johnson et al 2016 johnson and trout 2012 trout et al 2008 although results of this method are not as accurate as flux tower estimates they provide good agreement with lysimetric and flux tower measurement bryla et al 2010 johnson et al 2016 the average annual reference et for the period 2003 2014 was 550 mm year over ujb fig 6a which is very close to the et estimates provided by immerzeel et al 2015 lutz et al 2016 and bastiaanssen et al 2012 regarding gridded et datasets the performance of terraclimate and dolce seems better in terms of magnitude as well as spatial temporal distribution with higher correlation coefficient however the spatial distributions of terraclimte were found to be inferior to dolce whereas the temporal distribution of dolce was found to be inferior to terraclimate the gldas noah and ssebop datasets overestimated the reference et which seems unrealistic over partially snow fed basins the mod16a2 data was unable to present spatial as well as temporal patterns of et the underestimation of mod16a2 et was also reported by bookhagen and burbank 2010 over uib and other parts of the world the differences between reference and gridded et datasets are associated with errors and uncertainties in their forcing input parameters production mechanism and lack of calibrated ground observations in remote areas moreira et al 2019 for instance the satellite derived land surface temperature lst used in ssebop and mod16a2 has larger uncertainties over mountainous region due to cloud cover snow effect and conversion of instantaneous to daily values senay et al 2013 which further results in significant et errors moreover mod16a2 algorithm uses vapour pressure deficit as water stress input instead of p and soil moisture which would be overestimated for higher soil water content resulting in the underestimated soil evaporation and canopy transpiration hu et al 2015 although terraclimate and gldas noah land surface model also uses p as forcing input parameter yet p itself present larger uncertainties over mountainous region corresponding to complex topography xia et al 2015b 5 3 grace derived terrestrial water storage change the grace derived twsa and calculated twsc time series from jpl m and csr m of rl06 over ujb are shown in fig 7 these datasets show similar patterns with significant correlation coefficient of r 0 85 and r 0 81 for twsa and twsc respectively the slight differences in two datasets are owed to different approaches for the application of spatiotemporal constraints and scale of the grid cells https grace jpl nasa gov data choosing a solution as expected a strong seasonal fluctuation in tws with maximum in spring and minimum in winter was observed the state of gain in tws was observed after the onset of long p spell as a bimodal p pattern exists in the basin two peaks were observed in a year at the positive ends of tws the tws increases with the onset of spring p in the form of snow and reaches its maximum at the end of spring season afterwards tws tends to decrease with the melting of snow the ujb is known as an early riser as its snowmelt season starts in march to april before peaking in june and july a month earlier than the indus the early onset of snowmelt in ujb is attributed to the warming scenarios in western himalaya this is consistent with research that claims there has been glacial mass balance loss in the western himalaya due to an increase in temperature and the retreat has been faster in the karakorum and hindukush regions lv et al 2017 the tws again tends to increase with the start of monsoon p with a smaller peak in august the decline in tws from the end of monsoon p is translated into the removal of water from storage through rapidly generating streamflow evaporation from water bodies and transpiration from plants overall both datasets showed slight declining trend in tws in the basin during the studied period 2003 2014 at the rate of 0 0214 mm month and 0 0119 mm month for jpl m and csr m datasets respectively this decreasing trend was attributed to land use changes and changing p pattern due to global warming saddique et al 2020b the twsc was calculated using the backward difference equation eq 2 the long term twsc remained stable during the studied period 2003 2014 the csr m data shows more variations in twsc at both end peaks than jpl m the shaded area in fig 7 presents the uncertainty in datasets the higher uncertainty was observed for the jpl m derived twsa which may be attributed to the low spatial resolution the basin averaged uncertainty estimates of csr m derived twsa calculated from residuals of time series decomposition was comparable to the value recommended by csr institute 2 cm in water height in each 0 5 grid globally the results were also supported by the findings of xie et al 2019 and yoon et al 2019 over yarlung tsangpo river basin and hma respectively 5 4 twb dynamics and uncertainties in its components in this section the adequacy of different combinations of selected gridded p and et datasets to close the water budget was analyzed for this purpose twsc was calculated as a residual of water budget equation equation 1 hereafter referred as wb twsc and compared with csr m and jpl m derived twsc table 5 shows the correlation coefficient between wb twsc and two grace datasets csr m twsc and jpl m twsc the observed q time series was used in water budget equation for all p and et datasets pairs it is clearly seen that the wb twsc was better correlated with csr m twsc than jpl m twsc for all p and et datasets regarding p datasets the highest correlation coefficient between wb twsc and csr m twsc was obtained with era5 dataset followed by reference p dataset in context of et datasets the use of dolce in water budget equation provides better correlation coefficient the highest correlation coefficient and least imbalance was achieved with the combination of era5 and dolce datasets this shows the higher ability of era5 and dolce to close the water budget than reference datasets the graphical representation of csr m twsc and wb twsc along with monthly water fluxes of era5 dolce and observed q is shown in fig 8 a the bimodal p pattern with peaks in winter and summer season was observed the et patterns in the basin showed a single peak in summer season due to availability of sufficient energy and soil moisture in the form of temperature and monsoon p respectively during winter season the limited energy availability for the extraction of water from water bodies and soil moisture lower the et rates despite of enough moisture availability the temporal distribution of q showed a single peak usually in spring season when snowmelt combines with rainfall runoff the snowmelt in the ujb starts in march to april a month earlier than the uib as a result of increasing warming rates in the western himalayas a second smaller peak in the q was observed in the summer season for the 2006 and 2014 years these peaks were a result of intense monsoon rainfall which cause flooding conditions in the basin the twsc also exhibits two gaining peaks which coincides with the p peaks in winter and summer season the two losing peaks in twsc showed relatively dry season than winter and summer season it can also be seen that basin twsc exhibits strong seasonal fluctuations but changes in p are not obvious a comparison of the wb twsc and csr m twsc as time series reveals that both exhibit seasonal changes and demonstrate a fluctuating feature with a correlation coefficient of 0 81 however discrepancies are higher at both gaining and losing ends of peaks the imbalance or non closure errors imbalance p et q twsc varies in the range of 141 26 to 81 08 mm month with the median being close to 17 22 mm month and shows a seasonal cycle fig 8b more high values of imbalance were found at the positive side as compared to negative a higher positive imbalance was observed for the winter season where there are high p and least et rates on the other hand higher negative imbalance was observed in the summer season where high q and et rates respectively produced two peaks in wb twsc at losing ends this may be explained with the higher uncertainties of p during wet seasons as it can be seen in fig 8c the uncertainties of each twb component and their contribution to the overall uncertainty in the basin q computed by the error propagation equation are depicted in fig 8c the uncertainty of q is in the range of 22 96 to 118 46 mm per month with the largest error coming from the p the higher uncertainties contribution from p was also documented by many researchers around the world moreira et al 2019 xie et al 2019 yoon et al 2019 in general era5 data tend to overestimate p especially wet seasons when compared to reference dataset fig 3c the p uncertainty varies between 2 99 and 116 17 mm month the high values of uncertainties of p are also attributed to the under catches p and lack of in situ gauge stations over snow fed parts of the basin the uncertainty of et varies from 6 44 to 31 12 mm month and has been calculated through the same method as p irrespective of p the uncertainty of et remains consistent throughout the period regarding the uncertainties in csr m derived twsc our estimate of basin average uncertainty is 19 6 mm month which is near to the value recommended by institute 2 cm in water height in each 0 5 grid globally similar estimates of uncertainties are reported over yarlung tsangpo river basin in southwest of china xie et al 2019 and hma yoon et al 2019 xie et al 2019 estimated the uncertainties in p et and q to be in the range of 0 7 119 7 mm month 1 76 41 0 mm month and 8 60 122 0 mm month respectively across the hma yoon et al 2019 reported mean annual uncertainty to be 0 45 0 11 and 0 36 mm day for p et and q respectively 5 5 trend analysis the annual and seasonal trend maps of p et and tws were prepared using mk test results the lag 1 serial correlation coefficients of each pixel time series were calculated before applying mk trend test among the 79 pixels of study region significant lag 1 serial correlation exists at ten pixels of annual et in seasonal time series significant serial correlations were more pronounced in summer series the pre whitening process of serially correlated time series is commonly used to eliminate the effects of serial correlation before trend analysis yue et al 2002 however the controversies still exists about its utility for hydro meteorological time series as it leads to a loss of important information contained in a time series and reduces the power of the test when a trend exists razavi and vogel 2018 a simulation study carried out by bayazit and önöz 2007 documented that pre whitening should be applied except for large samples n 50 or when the coefficient of variation is very small as our sample size was small the pre whitening of the serially correlated time series was done using yue et al 2002 approach the annual and seasonal trend maps of three twb components is shown in fig 9 overall both upward and downward trends in annual p were detected and their magnitude vary between 21 00 to 48 00 mm year specifically the annual p tended to increase in the lower part of basin and decrease in the north west higher altitudes of the basin during the study period the increase and decrease in p in lower and upper part of the basins was attributed to the increase in summer monsoon and decrease in westerlies p respectively as clearly seen in seasonal trend maps however these positive and negative changes in p were not significant in most part of the basin at seasonal scale the non significant mixed trends were found in most part of the basin with a few significant positive pixels for all seasons except winter where significant decreasing trends were detected for most part of the basin at either 0 1 or 0 05 significance level contrasting results of p trends over greater himalaya were found in literature shrestha 2000 and archer and fowler 2004 reported no significant evidence of long term trend either increasing or decreasing over the nepalese himalaya and uib for the period of 1948 1994 and 1895 1999 respectively dimri and dash 2012 and kumar and jain 2010 also reported large scale decadal variation with increasing and decreasing p over himalaya however significant increasing trend were found for winter p october to march from 1961 to 1999 archer and fowler 2004 the results of our study are consistent with azmat 2015 who reported decreasing tendency τ 0 034 of snow cover area sca in winter over an altitude of 4000 m in ujb for the period of 2000 2010 the snow cover shrinkage tendency in high elevation areas of the himalayan range were also found by berthier et al 2007 recent studies conducted by zaz et al 2019 and shafiq et al 2020 on indian side ujb also showed decreasing trends of winter and spring p the contradictions in p trends are due to the study period as historic trend may not persist in future milly et al 2008 for instance the inclusion of 2000 2003 severe drought years in archer and fowler 2004 study may change the statistical significance of the trend regarding et trends over ujb or even uib very few studies were found in literature the results of mk statistics for et are presented in fig 9 a mixed trend for annual et with a magnitude of 8 0 to 5 50 mm year was observed for seasonal trends winter and spring seasons show decreasing and increasing trends at high and low altitude areas respectively whereas opposite trends are observed for summer season low turbulence of air due to a declining trend in wind velocity may be one explanation for dropping et rates at high altitudes akbar and gheewala 2020 despite of warming in himalaya as reported by many researchers zaz et al 2019 moreover the increasing trend in temperature did not necessarily cause an increase in et tamaddun et al 2019 moreira et al 2019 also observed that the et rates are regulated by a radiation balance p rates and vegetation physiological control rather than being exclusively limited by one of these factors the annual tws tended to decrease with a magnitude of 2 32 to 7 25 mm year in the basin at either 0 1 or 0 05 significance level despite the increase in annual p over lower part of the basin monsoon dominated tws shows declining trend even at higher significance level p greater than 0 05 this may be due to the rapidly generating rainfall runoff that leaves less time for recharging groundwater moreover the changes in lulc reduction in agricultural area in valleys and increase in settlement also reduce the infiltration to soil saddique et al 2020b shafiq et al 2020 at seasonal scale tws was decreasing during winter and spring seasons however significant decline was detected only for winter season for the summer and autumn seasons nonsignificant increasing trends were observed for most parts of the basin with a few pixels of slightly decreasing slope the tws are directly linked to amount and form of p the decreasing tws in winter and spring season directly linked to decrease p of the same seasons the study area has also witnessed the significant loss in glacierized area with kolahai receding by around 23 6 from 1962 to 2018 rashid et al 2020 and nehnar lost nearly half of its area from 1962 to 2017 shafiq et al 2020 the robustness of these gridded p et and tws trends analysis depends on how accurately the given gridded dataset represents the basin behavior in space and time in present study the selected gridded p era5 et dolce and twsa csr m datasets performed well in direct comparison against reference point data at monthly seasonal and annual scale the suitability and reliability of era5 has also been reported by many researchers over ujb and surrounding regions ansari and grossi 2022 arshad et al 2021 liaqat et al 2022 baudouin et al 2020 whereas the doce et estimates are consistent with the previous studies conducted over larger scale than ujb lutz et al 2016 immerzeel et al 2015 bastiaanssen et al 2012 notwithstanding era5 overestimates the observed basin fig 3a and 3c it accurately reproduces the seasonal distribution and presents least temporal differences against observed gauge data fig 3b and 3d the overestimation of era5 against observed data is defensible and can be explained with low density unevenly distributed station network lying at low altitudes which mostly received liquid p whereas the hydrologically active part of the basin remained ungauged baudouin et al 2020 shafeeque et al 2019 khan and koch 2018 immerzeel et al 2015 azmat 2015 moreover among all p datasets era5 p has the highest sufficiency to sustain the water balance with dolce et and csr m tws datasets table 5 immerzeel et al 2015 and shafeeque et al 2019 also argue that the observed p over uib is underestimated and the water balance closure can be achieved only if the p in gridded datasets is 2 8 times greater than the observed p in these datasets at higher altitudes the overestimation of gridded dataset could be different owing to the use of different p datasets different size and location of study areas and different mass balance values overall because of the limited number of climatic stations at high altitudes of the ujb the era5 proves to be a good alternative of observed precipitation for further implications in impact studies which needs continuous precipitation estimates in space and time the results of mk statistics for monthly seasonal and annual q time series are shown in fig 10 the increasing trends were detected for all months of the year except january and february where runoff shows decreasing trend however this increase or decrease in monthly q is insignificant but for september which is significant at 0 05 significance level in terms of seasonal trends statistically insignificant upward and downward trends were observed for summer autumn and winter spring seasons respectively the possible reason behind the insignificant increase in march to may months q was attributed to the early onset of snow melting due to warming scenarios in western himalaya as reported by many researchers rashid et al 2020 shafiq et al 2020 zaz et al 2019 wescoat jr et al 2018 also reported the expected shift of jhelum hydrograph to earlier q about one month earlier than the indus river whereas the insignificant decreasing trend over spring season may correspond to the decreasing trend of winter p for annual q time series a positive yet insignificant trend with a magnitude of 5 7 mm year was observed primarily the increase in annual q is predominantly caused by increasing monsoon p from low altitude areas the results of annual q trend are concurrent with wescoat jr et al 2018 who found increase in q for the period 2001 2016 despite of overall decreasing trend for the 1922 2016 6 conclusion with reference to above analysis the major conclusions of this study can be summarized as follows the spatial patterns and seasonal distribution of p were reasonably well captured by all gridded p datasets however huge discrepancies in the mean estimates were found across these datasets era5 pdataset was considered to be the most appropriate to present p behavior over ujb in space and time despite its overestimation against reference dataset the underlying reasons for this selection lie in its better performance in terms of time series disparities r nsd crmse while the observed average p due to lack of climate stations over snow fed parts of the basins governing et its absolute estimates are very few and highly ambiguous over entire uib including ujb due to absence of flux towers and high topographic heterogeneity high discrepancies were observed spatially and temporally for all gridded et datasets as compared to p datasets among all gridded et datasets dolce performed reasonably well in terms of magnitude as well as of spatiotemporal distribution yet it is unable to represent the high et rates of kashmir valley encapsulated between two mountainous series small differences were found in twsc derived from csr m and jpl m of rl06 r o 89 however the csr m shows higher correlation coefficients when compared to water balance derived twsc for all p and et combinations the results indicate that the grace mascon solutions with finer spatial resolution also provide a satisfactory result for small basins high uncertainties in twb estimates cause imbalance or non closure errors the major contribution to imbalance arises from p mainly during the wet seasons this shows the significant need to adjust p estimates before using it for impact assessment studies contradictions in p trends over greater himalaya are present in the literature these contrasting results might be due to different datasets and study periods used for trend analysis in each work in present study non significant mixed trends in annul p at a rate of 21 00 to 48 00 mm year were observed with increase and decrease in monsoon and winter p respectively the decrease in winter p was found to be significant throughout the basin at either 0 1 or 0 05 significance level whereas statistically non significant increasing trends were observed for all other seasons in context to et mixed yet statistically significant trends were detected in different parts of the basin at annual and seasonal scale the mixed trends despite of the increasing temperature in western himalaya demonstrate that higher et rates do not correspond to higher temperature rates and vice versa but they are influenced by a number of factors such as balance of radiations p rates and vegetation physiological control the tws shows a significant decreasing trend throughout the ujb in winter and annual scale at either 0 1 or 0 05 significance level the decreasing trend in winter season is directly linked to the decreasing trend of winter p and loss of glacier mass due to global warming in western himalaya however the decreasing trend in annual tws despite of the increasing p in low altitudes areas is due to rapidly generating runoff that leaves less time for recharging groundwater the q at mangla station showed increasing trends in all months of the year except january and february during the 2003 2014 corresponding to precipitation trends the early snow melting in combination with increasing p trends especially in monsoon dominated regions are primarily reasons of q increase credit authorship

2870,the study presents a comprehensive assessment of the key terrestrial water budget twb components and their recent temporal trends using observed and gridded datasets across upper jhelum basin ujb for the period of 2003 2014 different gridded datasets were used for precipitation p aphrodite chirps pgmfd era 5 and mswep evapotranspiration et mod16a2 ssebop gldas noah terraclimate and dolce gravity recovery and climate experiment grace derived terrestrial water storage tws and observed discharge q measurements firstly gridded p and et datasets were assessed through detailed spatiotemporal analysis against reference datasets and considering their adequacy to close the twb the imbalance in twb and associated uncertainties of each component were also computed to understand the potential of gridded datasets for water budget studies finally twb components were subjected to trend analysis to evaluate temporal trends and their statistical significance over the study period overall era5 pand dolce et relatively performed better and hence considered to be the most appropriate to present the hydrological spatiotemporal variability across ujb the imbalance in water budget was mainly associated with higher uncertainties in p especially during wet periods the results of temporal trend analysis showed a insignificant mixed trends for annual p with increase and decrease in monsoon and winter p respectively b mixed yet statistically significant trends for et in different parts of basin at annual and seasonal scale c significant decreasing trends for tws throughout the ujb in winter and annual scale d increasing trends for q in all months of the year except january and february despite the imbalance in water budget estimation due to large uncertainties in gridded p et and tws datasets the study underlines the important information about twb dynamics and their spatiotemporal variability over ujb which can be used as the knowledge base for further impact assessment studies keywords precipitation evapotranspiration terrestrial water storage change water balance dynamics uncertainty data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction knowledge of the terrestrial water budget twb components and their dynamics over large spatial scale are crucial to understand the water resources availability and management the potential risk of hydro hazards floods and droughts and the interactions of the land surface with the atmosphere under a changing environment overall the ground based measurement of twb components over large spatial scale has long been a challenge around the world primarily owing to limited and inconsistent measurement networks and their intrinsic inaccuracies particularly in mountainous environment like the upper jhelum basin ujb 33467 km2 where complex climatic and terrain conditions prevail franchito et al 2009 in addition the data scarcity for the transboundary river basins may increase due to political issues among the sharing countries the aforementioned issues motivate practicing hydrologists to look beyond the available ground measurements for alternative data sources providing continuous estimates of twb components in space and time in this context the regional global gridded datasets based on observations reanalysis and satellite remote sensing are unique in their ability to capture spatiotemporal estimates of twb components at different spatial and temporal resolutions with the potential to provide data for regions with low density in situ measurements around the globe moreira et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 oliveira et al 2014 to date several gridded precipitation p and evapotranspiration et datasets are available in near real time with quasi global to global coverage the use of these datasets to study twb components however is not straightforward as no single gridded dataset can be said to be perfect for all conditions in fact different datasets of the same geophysical variable can include errors and uncertainties particularly at higher altitudes where sources and magnitudes of the variable exhibit large variability leading to inconsistency between estimates of the same variable pellet et al 2020 these errors and uncertainties could be associated with the way they are developed and or the lack of calibrated ground observations in remote areas jia et al 2012 thiemig et al 2013 therefore a comprehensive performance assessment of these gridded p and et datasets for the area of interest is necessary before their subsequent use in any studies research conducted in different regions of the world has shown that the performance of these p and et gridded datasets could vary from region to region omonge et al 2022 moreira et al 2019 baudouin et al 2020 motta et al 2019 mccabe et al 2016 michel et al 2016 xie et al 2019 over high mountains of asia hma various studies investigated the performance of different p gridded datasets from reanalysis models and remote sensing andermann et al 2011 hu et al 2016 palazzi et al 2013 you et al 2015 for example ma et al 2009 and you et al 2015 evaluated few atmospheric reanalysis p datasets in tibetan plateau and found large negative biases in these datasets though the gauge based datasets such as asian precipitation highly resolved observational data integration toward evaluation aphrodite have a better match with in situ observation they feature p under catch at higher altitudes which significantly impact the p trends and quality andermann et al 2011 hu et al 2016 immerzeel et al 2015 the research conducted on upper indus basin uib by immerzeel et al 2015 also stated that aphrodite underestimates the p for snow and glacier fed basins the errors and uncertainties in the satellite based datasets are attributed to photon scattering associated with terrestrial snow cover you et al 2015 for instance the tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm has been found to reproduce rainfall well in wet regions and in warm seasons in east asia shen et al 2010 but the dataset largely overestimates extreme rainfall in south asia hu et al 2016 these studies in general endorse the biases and uncertainties in existing gridded p datasets especially over the himalayas mountain ranges in addition to gridded p datasets hundreds of et algorithms have been developed since 1970 s and the availability of the global scale et datasets has increased some reviews of et algorithms from earth observation data can be found in kalma et al 2008 karimi and bastiaanssen 2015 wang and dickinson 2012 like p gridded et datasets are also subjected to discrepancies due to deficiencies in the model structure input datasets and model parameter related errors scale expansion problems and limited flux tower data for validation jia et al 2012 xia et al 2015a the previous studies of the comparison of gridded et datasets in different regions of the world motta et al 2019 mccabe et al 2016 michel et al 2016 generally concluded that variations among et datasets can lead to significantly different estimates of annual runoff water storage change and irrigation requirements demanding for a thorough evaluation of the available datasets for the study area the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace and its successor grace follow on grace fo tapley et al 2004 are an active remote sensing rs satellite it measures change in mass gravity field variation over large spatial scale to infer vertically integrated estimates of terrestrial water storage tws at the monthly basis the tws from both grace and grace fo missions includes all terms of storage on the land surface glacier snowpack vegetation canopy lakes wetlands rivers etc and subsurface soil moisture groundwater many researchers integrate grace observations with hydrological data from variety of sources including global land data assimilation system gldas models rodell et al 2004 in situ measurements and rs data to provide improved descriptions of water fluxes such as groundwater storage changes gwsc scanlon et al 2012a surface water consumption anderson et al 2012 regional flood potential long et al 2014b reager and famiglietti 2009 drought monitoring long et al 2014b sun et al 2018 reservoir storage changes yi et al 2017 ice mass loss sasgen et al 2010 and water budget closure lv et al 2017 pellet et al 2020 sheffield et al 2009 these studies concluded that grace data can well monitor the variations in terrestrial water storage initially grace data applications are limited to large basins with drainage area of more than 200 000 km2 due to its coarse spatial resolution 4 and higher potential of errors for small basins lower signal to noise ratio however the finer spatial resolution of grace mascon solutions in release 6 rl06 makes it applications possible for small basin studies moreover grace observation is sensitive to total mass changes concentrated within a smaller area if the magnitude is sufficient longuevergne et al 2013 scanlon et al 2012b scanlon et al 2016 abou zaki et al 2019 monitored depletion in ground water storages from grace observations in bakhtegan catchment 31511 km2 iran and found good agreement between grace derived ground water storage change and observations at wells similarly ouma et al 2015 found consistent and close correlation between grace derived twsc and observed gwsc in the nzoia river basin 12709 km2 in kenya further application of grace data for smaller basins can be found in the following studies becker et al 2010 swenson and wahr 2009 wang et al 2011 understanding the origin of uncertainties in gridded datasets and their spatial variability is another critical issue that deserves comprehensive study investigation of the errors that can exist in these datasets is important for achieving future water cycle observation missions with fewer errors regarding water balance closure gao et al 2010 sahoo et al 2011 penatti et al 2015 the current study is conducted keeping in mind the hydrological applications to create awareness about uncertainties and biases in gridded p et and tws datasets over transboundary ujb located at the foothills of western himalayas a most affected mountainous range by climate change the region already witnessed an increase in extreme hydro meteorological extreme events in the last few decades ansari et al 2022 and are expected to become even more pronounced in the coming future pachauri et al 2014 in this context twb components estimations from gridded datasets become important tools for comprehensively understanding the water dynamics in the region although a number of studies have already been conducted on the performance evaluation of gridded p datasets and their associated uncertainties however the et component has received less attention and remains unexplored as far as the grace satellite tws is concerned the coarse spatial resolution 1 of spherical harmonics sh solutions restricts its application in hydrological studies over ujb with the improvement in spatial resolution of grace mascon solution in rl06 grace data can be used also for small basin e g area less than 200 000 km2 studies the same goes for the trend analysis which have been carried out only for essential climatic variables e g p and temperature saddique et al 2020a shafiq et al 2020 in this regard the current study is the first attempt to evaluate a number of gridded p et and tws datasets for water balance studies over ujb the uncertainties in these gridded datasets are firstly evaluated against direct comparison with observed gauge data at monthly seasonal and annual scale and subsequently their abilities are assessed in terms of water budget closure finally trend analysis is carried out for each twb component with a more accurate and reliable gridded p et tws and observed discharge q to check its statistical significance for the period 2003 2014 2 study area the jhelum river is one of the main tributaries of indus river contributing 16 1 of its mean annual flow mahmood and jia 2016 the jhelum river feeds the second largest reservoir of pakistan mangla reservoir which is mainly used to irrigate the downstream floodplains of pakistan s punjab province about six million hectares the water for irrigation purposes is mainly released through power tunnel with power generation as the secondary objective the mangla dam has a hydro power generation capacity of about 1310 mw accounting for 6 of total country power generation from all sources and 15 of hydroelectric power archer and fowler 2004 the mangla watershed or ujb is the catchment area of the jhelum river upstream of the mangla dam it extends from latitudes of 33 00 ʹ n 35 12ʹ n and longitudes of 73 07ʹ e 75 40ʹ e fig 1 a it covers an area of about 33 467 km2 and its elevation ranges from 223 m to 6201 m above mean sea level msl the ujb hosts pir panjal and western himalaya mountainous ranges in the east and northwest of the basin according to the randolph glacier inventory rgi 6 0 consortium 2017 approximately 0 75 252 km2 of the ujb is covered by perennial glaciers the hypsometric curve glaciated area and the climatic stations elevation range is shown in fig 1b the hydro climatology of ujb is strongly governed by two distinct p systems western disturbances and monsoon dominated in north western and southern parts of the basin respectively the mean annual p ranges from 805 mm at pir chinasi 2875 m msl to 1926 mm at narran 2419 m msl while the mean annual minimum and maximum temperature varies from 1 26 c at narran 2419 m msl to 30 20 c at mangla 265 m msl station table 1 lists the climatic stations within and adjacent to ujb as well as their characteristics the basin is imperilled by dual data scarcity issues first trans boundary catchment with 56 18 966 km2 of its area situated in india second limited spatial distribution and low density climatic stations network mostly located in low altitudes less than 2800 m msl the mean annual flow 823 30 m3 s draining into mangla reservoir at the outlet of ujb is a combination of immediate flow generated by rainfall in the low altitude part of the basin and delayed runoff generated by snow and glacier melt from the high altitude part of the basin these flows are essential and primary source of irrigation for the downstream flood plains 3 datasets 3 1 reference p and et data ideally the in situ data from well distributed measurement networks are a good reference to assess the performance of the global gridded p and et datasets at basin scale in case of ujb which is subject to dual data scarcity issue i e low density unevenly distributed network lying at low altitudes and transboundary river basin the limited availability of observed data at least helps the researchers to know the varying range of performances of the global datasets and their spatiotemporal distribution at basin scale in this study the observed daily p and temperature data from seventeen climatic stations located within political boundary of pakistan were used as a reference dataset these stations are operated and maintained by the pakistan meteorological department pmd and water and power development authority wapda of pakistan for the indian side region indian meteorological department imd daily gridded p and temperature datasets derived from a dense network of meteorological stations for the indian mainland pai et al 2014 were extracted at the five stations and used as a reference data for that region the detailed summary of these stations is given in table 1 regarding et different methods are available for its computation either direct or indirect since there is not a single flux tower et measurement in the studied region the reference data for actual et hereafter referred as evapotranspiration et was calculated using an indirect method indirect et estimation from twb equation depends on the accuracy of other hydrological variables for example precipitation runoff and total water storage change as there are few precipitation stations constrained by uneven distribution at low altitudes therefore this approach can provide uncertain estimates another indirect et estimation makes combined use of rs based vegetation indices vis and in situ or remotely sensed meteorological data this method has been widely used for the estimation of actual evapotranspiration and crop water use efficiency this hybrid approach used vegetation fractional cover fc amin et al 2020 johnson and trout 2012 trout et al 2008 glenn et al 2010 verger et al 2009 and crop coefficient kc derived from remotely sensed vis pôças et al 2020 calera et al 2017 kamble et al 2013 jayanthi et al 2007 along with reference evapotranspiration eto or potential evapotranspiration pet for the estimation of actual evapotranspiration crop coefficients kc primarily depends on the dynamics of canopies cover fraction lai greenness since satellite data can help to estimate some key variables related to vegetation phenology myneni et al 1997 duchemin et al 1999 gutman 1999 bastiaanssen et al 2000 they offer opportunities for monitoring the space and time variability of kc the method is similar to et eto kc where kc is the function of vi kc obtained from vis are more robust than conventional kc values since they estimate current vegetation conditions in space and time maselli et al 2014 marcial pablo et al 2021 kullberg et al 2017 in present study green vegetation fraction based kc values were used along with pet to calculate et since green vegetation fraction is a scalar value for multiplication by pet it is functionally the same as a crop coefficient allen et al 1998a groeneveld and baugh 2007 groeneveld et al 2007 the pet was calculated using hargreaves 1994 equation due to data limitation the present study used maximum green vegetation fraction a global dataset spatial resolution 1 km

were evaluated against reference data at monthly seasonal and annual scale these datasets can be distinguished by the way they assimilate observations and produce distributed p fields table 2 offers a brief overview of the chosen datasets the asian precipitation highly resolved observational data integration toward evaluation aphrodite is based on a dense network of up to 8000 daily rain gauge data

chirps dataset is developed by climate hazards group chg and the united states geological survey usgs which has a spatial resolution of 0 05 and temporal resolution at daily and monthly scale it was developed with combined use of ground based gauge measurements and cold cloud duration measurement by the synergistic use of satellite thermal infrared band funk et al 2015 the princeton global meteorological forcing dataset for land surface modelling pgmfd sheffield et al 2009 was developed by terrestrial hydrology group at princeton university and is based on the observed and ncep ncar reanalysis i data the dataset is currently available at 1 0 plus 0 5 and 0 25 3 hourly plus daily and monthly resolution globally for 1961 2016 the era5 a relatively new reanalysis data launched by

spatial resolution beck et al 2017 beck et al 2019 it takes advantage of the complementary strengths of in situ measurements satellites observations and reanalysis data and validated at global scale using observations from 70 000 discharge gauges and hydrological modelling for 9000 catchments with daily gauge corrections 3 3 gridded evapotranspiration datasets et estimations from five global datasets mod16a2 ssebop gldas noah terraclimate and dolce were evaluated against the reference et data these datasets differ in their input data source and production mechanism table 3 gives a brief summary of the selected datasets the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer product mod16a2 is a widely used global terrestrial et dataset that has been computed using an algorithm proposed by mu et al 2011 which employs the logic of the penman monteith equation monteith 1965 the input parameters includes the daily meteorological reanalysis data of the global modelling and assimilation office gmao hu et al 2015 along with modis remotely sensed data products the land surface models lsms in the global land data assimilation system 2 1 gldas 2 1 such as noah ek et al 2003 produce optimal fields of the terrestrial water andenergy fluxesthrough the combined use of ground based observations remote sensing and modelled datasets this dataset is available at a spatial resolution of 0 25 and 1 0 and temporal resolution of 3 h and monthly the operational simplified surface energy balance ssebop et dataset was generated using single source energy balance model senay et al 2013 the algorithm integrates the standardized version of penman monteith equation allen et al 1998b and et fractions generated from remotely sensed modis thermal imagery using a thermal index approach to account the topographical impacts on surface temperature the derived optimal linear combination evapotranspiration dolce is a new hybrid et dataset derived by merging eleven available global et datasets the contribution of each merging dataset to dolce is defined by its ability to represent ground et measurements at 260 sites as well as its dependence on the other parent datasets hobeichi et al 2018 terraclimate et is estimated using a one dimensional modified thornthwaite mather climatic water balance model abatzoglou et al 2018 inputs for the water balance calculation include p reference et and satellite derived plant extractable soil water capacity at 0 5 resolution wang erlandsson et al 2016 3 4 grace data the grace derived total water storage anomaly twsa data from two institutes center for space research csr and jet propulsion laboratory jpl of released 6 rl06 mascon mass concentration solutions were used in this study save et al 2016 the mascon solutions are available at a spatial resolution of 0 25 and 0 5 in cm of equivalent water height for csr and jpl respectively the two mascon solutions via derived twsa differ slightly due to different approaches for the application of spatiotemporal constraints and scale of the grid cells https grace jpl nasa gov data choosing a solution table 4 gives a brief overview of the used datasets the few missing months in grace data are due to battery management these missing epochs were filled by linear interpolation from the previous and following months of the missing data this method was considered as rational because it keeps a good seasonal cycle at the monthly temporal resolution long et al 2014a sheffield et al 2009 in this study grace mascon solutions were preferred instead of spherical harmonic sh solutions due to two reasons firstly the finer spatial resolution and secondly reduced leakage from land to ocean and application of geophysical data constraints during processing with little empirical post processing requirements pellet et al 2020 3 5 in situ river discharge data the daily flow at mangla station outlet of ujb were obtained from surface water hydrology project of wapda pakistan for the period of 2003 2014 from daily data monthly aggregates of flow were calculated and converted to water depth mm to keep compatible with the other components in water budget equation 4 methods 4 1 performance evaluation of gridded p and et datasets the performance of gridded p and et datasets were evaluated against the reference data for a period of twelve years 2003 2014 at monthly seasonal and annual scale the lower and upper limit of the study period was limited by the availability of grace data and consistent and complete records of reference data respectively the evaluation was made on station basis to avoid the uncertainties and errors induced by conversion of observed point data to gridded format and spatial scale matching hu et al 2016 the spatial discrepancies among gridded datasets and reference data were assessed by visualization the disparities in time series were analysed via the taylor diagram which incorporate correlation coefficient r normalized standard deviation nsd and centred root mean square error crmse 4 2 twb dynamics and uncertainty characterization the equation 1 presents the simplified form of water budget based on the principle of mass conservation the equation was used to analyse the twb dynamics at monthly time step over ujb the twsc was calculated as a residual of equation 1 using observed and gridded datasets and compared with grace mascon derived twsc as grace provides mass anomalies of tws at irregular space intervals the storage changes were calculated by the simple difference time derivative of tws anomalies as presented in equation 1 difference between two sub sequent time steps of the grace data representing the average variation of the tws 1 δ s δ t δ t w s δ t tws t 1 tws t δ t where δs δt is terrestrial water storage change for month t tws t 1 and tws t are terrestrial water storage anomalies for month t 1 and t respectively in agreement with moreira et al 2019 rodell et al 2004 sheffield et al 2009 monthly averages between two time steps of p et and q variables were used to make these components comparable with the tws change equation 2 2 δ s δ t p t 1 p t 2 et t 1 et t 2 q t 1 q t 2 here subscripts t 1 and t denotes the month of the respective variable the uncertainty analysis was conducted on the basis of the principle of gaussian error propagation since the present study used observed discharge data which is relatively more accurate than gridded datasets therefore uncertainties contributions of these gridded twb components towards discharge were calculated as one standard deviation via the principle of gaussian error propagation assuming that the components are independent of each other no covariance between any two components long et al 2014a lv et al 2017 sheffield et al 2009 the assumption makes it simpler to calculate the uncertainty contribution of each component separately this approach is particularly useful when the error in the input data is known in fact it has been applied in numerous hydrological studies that use rs data for water balance analysis and produce reliable estimates long et al 2014a lv et al 2017 therefore the uncertainty of total basin q σq is computed as follows 3 σ q σ p 2 σ et 2 σ twsc 2 where σp σet σtwsc are the uncertainty in monthly p et and twsc respectively the uncertainty in p and et were estimated as the standard deviation σ of the observed and selected gridded p and et datasets at each station the uncertainties of these stations were then averaged to calculate basin level uncertainties the uncertainty of jpl m derived twsa can be calculated from the original grace data and are available at http grace jpl nasa gov while a rigorous uncertainty analysis of csr m is still in progress https www2 csr utexas edu grace rl05 mascons html therefore the method described by scanlon et al 2016 wahr et al 2006 was used to calculate the uncertainties in csr m the method involves the calculation of uncertainties from the residuals after decomposition of the time series into long term trends and inter annual annual and semi annual amplitudes as presented in equation 4 the detailed description of the method can be found in scanlon et al 2016 wahr et al 2006 4 s total s long t e r m s annual s semiannual r e s i d u a l inter annual signals were estimated by fitting 13 month moving averages to the residuals in equation 4 the root mean square rms of the residual approximates the measurement uncertainty in csr m because of the high grid resolution of csr m 0 25 leakage errors were assumed to be negligible and were neglected 4 3 trend analysis the annual and seasonal trends in each twb components were analyzed for each pixel using the robust nonparametric regression techniques mann kendall mk test kendall 1948 mann 1945 in conjunction with theil sen theil 1950 estimates at 0 05 and 0 1 significance level 95 and 90 confidence level the mk test was carried out using r package modifiedmk after removing lag one serial correlation if present for this purpose trend free pre whitening tfpw method was employed on serially correlated time series before trend analysis the mk test results were used to create trends maps using arcgis 10 1 software 5 results discussion 5 1 comparison and performance evaluation of gridded precipitation datasets the spatiotemporal comparison of selected gridded p datasets against reference dataset was carried out at monthly seasonal and annual scale employed over the twelve years of period 2003 2014 the basin average reference p was estimated through interpolation of unevenly distributed twenty two meteorological stations mostly installed at low elevation areas considering topography as a predictor known as kriging with external drift ked goovaerts 2000 to check the robustness of the interpolated precipitation cross validation has been applied to annual reference precipitation by the leave one out approach cross validation is a common method for validating the accuracy of interpolation techniques voltz and webster 1990 in this technique information regarding one point is removed temporarily the removed information is estimated from the remaining data points and the difference between the actual and estimated values is calculated this operation is repeated for the remainder of the points one objection to using cross validation is that the whole data sample is often used to define the interpolation model and that the validation therefore might be considered not to be totally independent tveito et al 2008 in order to avoid the limitation of using cross validation an independent validation procedure was used that consists of splitting the data sample into two parts hence 18 stations were used for interpolation purposes while the remaining 4 stations were used for independent validation this procedure is repeated three times with different combinations as shown in fig s1 the results show that the rmse is higher when one station at high altitude gulmarg at 2705 m is taken out for validation purposes overall the rmse range between 51 83 and 64 80 mm year rata et al 2020 compared three interpolation methods for mean annual rainfall in the cheliff watershed algeria and found rmse 49 5 54 0 and 61 4 mm year for ked regression kriging and ordinary kriging respectively borges et al 2016 also found rmse in the range of 50 12 70 35 mm year for different interpolation methods in distrito federal brazil although the accuracy of interpolation methods depends on the geographical location and the density of measurement station network as evident in our study however these studies showed better results of ked for annual precipitation and comparable errors the average annual and seasonal spatial distribution of reference and gridded p datasets are shown in fig 2 the spatial distribution shows that the average annual reference p was highest over the northwest of the ujb snow fed sub basin and or high altitude areas and the lowest annual p was observed in kashmir valley and the southern part of the basin low altitude areas the significant uncertainties in the spatial distribution of mean annual p of the selected gridded p datasets was observed against reference dataset the spatial patterns of mswep and era5 were somewhat similar but overestimated to reference data the pgmfd presents the worst performance in terms of spatial distribution at annual scale at seasonal scale overall reference and all selected gridded p datasets showed higher p over northern part of the ujb in all seasons except summer season in which the highest p was received over southern part of the basin in the form of monsoon rainfall in winter and spring seasons a clear distinctive divide line himalayas divide line in the middle of the ujb at pir panjal mountainous range was seen in reference dataset restricting the downward penetration of westerlies p however the effect of westerlies p was dominated in the surrounding downward regions of the divide line in winter season in summer season southwest part of the basin received highest p the least influence of southwest monsoon was observed in kashmir valley which is encapsulated between two mountain ranges the pir panjal mountains acts as a barrier in the way of monsoonal winds transported from the indian ocean however the valley experiences the influence of monsoon during late summer with typically low magnitude and intensity sen et al 2017 the similar spatial pattern was captured with mswep and era5 datasets the pgmfd aphrodite and chirps were unable to perform good in all seasons the average annual reference p was 1150 mm year over the entire ujb however mean annual p varied widely between the reference and gridded p datasets fig 3 a among all gridded datasets era5 and pgmfd showed the highest and lowest mean annual p in ujb the era5 and mswep overestimated mean annual p by 37 and 14 comparative to reference data respectively on the other side aphrodite chirps and pgmfd underestimated the mean annual p by 5 15 and 28 comparative to reference data respectively the seasonal distribution of p showed a little variation among reference and gridded p datasets except chirps and pgmfd fig 3b the autumn season contributed the least to annual p among all seasons for all datasets the combined contribution of winter and spring p to annual p was more than 50 for all datasets except chirps and pgmfd which showed larger contribution of summer season p monthly p distribution for reference and gridded p datasets are shown in fig 3c overall all datasets present more or less bimodal regime of p with peaks in february and end of july highlighting the dominance of westerlies and monsoon p respectively the northern and eastern parts of the ujb lie in himalayas and pir panjal ranges and receive more than 50 of its annual p in the winter and spring seasons as a result of westerlies regime the second peak in july is the result of summer monsoon prevailing in the southern part of the basin the shape of the second peak of all gridded datasets varied from reference data which showed a slight declining plateau from mid of july to end of august a similar but fairly stable plateau was captured by chirps dataset from mid of july to mid of september in addition era5 and aphrodite datasets produced slightly higher peaks in spring season whereas pgmfd mswep and chirps datasets generates higher peaks in summer monsoon season the temporal disparities in gridded p datasets against reference data were evaluated on station basis a taylor diagram fig 3d summarizes the main statistical metrics nsd r crmse at monthly seasonal and annual scale the proximity of gridded datasets to reference data indicates a good performance the colors in fig 3d represent the different gridded datasets and the shape represents the temporal scale at which comparison was made the performance of all gridded p datasets was relatively better at monthly time scale while it was found to be worst at annual scale except pgmfd which showed a relatively better correlation coefficient r 0 5 overall era5 relatively outperformed over other datasets at monthly and seasonal scale r 0 7 0 8 crmse 0 6 0 7 normalized standard deviation 09 1 0 regarding the selection of suitable gridded p dataset for ujb one also need to consider the uncertainties in reference dataset despite of considering the effect of local topography in interpolation the basin average p estimates still have uncertainties due to low density station network contrasting reviews are reported in literature about the performance of ked technique for p for instance masson and frei 2014 reported considerable improvement in interpolation accuracy with ked compared to other linear regressions without any predictor in high mountainous regions on the other hand berndt and haberlandt 2018 ly et al 2011 argue that topographical impact was indispensable for only temperature reconstruction at all temporal resolutions and station densities but it was less clear for daily to monthly p furthermore all spatial interpolation techniques can perform poorly in regions with insufficient high elevation data due to inaccurate estimation of local lapse rates ruelland 2020 considering all above reviews it can be concluded that the basin average observed p estimates are underestimated owing to the under catch p and unevenly distributed low density approx 1 gauge 2235 km2 climate station network especially at high altitude areas which are the main active parts of the basins azmat 2015 grossi et al 2017 ranzi et al 2003 winiger et al 2005 moreover the p increases with elevation up to 4500 m in himalaya mountainous range and then start to decrease immerzeel et al 2015 whereas the climatic stations are installed up to 3000 m elevation for this reason gridded datasets have been used across a wide range of hydrological modeling research around the world these gridded datasets have substantial differences with reference as well as among themselves figs 2 3 and these differences are mostly due to the deficiencies in their data sources and generation mechanisms overall the performance of era5 dataset was considered to be best with higher correlation even though it overestimates the reference p especially during wet months fig 3a and 3c the pgmfd and chirps datasets have been found highly underestimated and unable to capture spatial patterns when compared to the reference p the aphrodite and mswep both perform well in terms of magnitude and capture the monthly and seasonal p cycle fig 3a 3c however aphrodite underestimate the basin average p like reference p various authors also reported the underestimation of aphrodite over high mountains of asia the meteorological stations used to produce aphrodite dataset yatagai et al 2012 are probably located at lower elevations and cannot represent the high altitude p the underlying explanation for aphrodite chirps underestimation is that the low altitude measurement network and satellite based estimates only observe liquid p whereas era5 estimates both liquid and solid p immerzeel et al 2015 shafeeque et al 2019 moreover era5 is built on a data assimilation scheme and the ecmwf ifs forecast model which includes fully coupled components for atmosphere land surface and ocean waves with closure of atmospheric water balance copernicus 2019 our selection of era5 for ujb was supported by baudouin et al 2020 who cross validated 20 gridded p datasets across indus river and suggested that era5 provides better p estimates in terms of magnitude temporal distribution and variability from daily to multi annual scale immerzeel et al 2015 corrected the aphrodite p data based on glacier mass balance over uib from 1998 to 2007 and found it very close to era interim the third generation of ecmwf which is replaced by fifth generation reanalysis era5 with improved parameterizations and higher resolution nogueira 2020 5 2 comparison and performance evaluation of gridded evapotranspiration datasets the spatiotemporal comparison of gridded et datasets against reference dataset were conducted at monthly seasonal and annual scale the annual and seasonal spatial distribution of reference and gridded et datasets averaged over twelve years of period 2003 2014 are presented in fig 4 as compared to p larger discrepancies were observed among et datasets in terms of magnitude as well as spatial distribution at annual scale the land use land cover lulc maps for the starting and ending year of the study period are shown in fig 5 to explain the spatial distribution of et with reference to lulc because of its direct association with et the lulc was classified into seven classes including agriculture forest grass water bodies permanent snow and ice built up lands and barren land the grass forest and agriculture are three major lulc dominating over high mid and low elevation areas respectively permanent snow and ice covered a negligible area in the northwest of the basin whereas the mangla reservoir can be seen in the south of the basin in the water body class the barren land can be observed within the densely grassy mountains of western himalaya and pir panjal the urban settlement class was concentrated in the kashmir valley major lulc changes from 2003 to 2014 can be observed in agriculture decrease and forest increase class the change was prominent in kashmir valley where afforestation replaced the agricultural land concerning spatial distribution at annual scale the reference et dataset shows a decrease in et rates with increase in elevation the highest et rates of reference dataset can be observed in kashmir valley and southern part of the basin which correspond to the agricultural land fig 5 the part of the basin which hosts western himalaya shows the lowest et rates the pir panjal mountains show higher et rates as compared to western himalaya the difference in et rates despite of the same land cover densely grassed area with small patches of barren land is due to the temperature difference corresponding to different elevation moreover et at high elevation mountainous regions of himalaya only plays a minor role in overall water budget and is generally less than 10 of total hydrological budget bookhagen 2010 khan and koch 2018 this also applies to ujb where only lower altitude areas have higher et contribution while the high elevation sub catchments have only minor annual et due to their low average temperatures the spatial inhomogeneity of et among the forest grass and agricultural land covers were caused by the spatial inhomogeneous soil water content under these land covers the spatial inhomogeneity of et over cultivated land could be a potential indicator of making reasonable and effective irrigation schedule for different crops on the farmland regarding the spatial distribution of gridded datasets ssebop spatial patterns were somewhat similar yet overestimated the reference dataset the mod16a2 and terraclimate datasets present contrasting spatial patterns with higher et rates at higher elevation and vice versa among all et datasets the dolce reasonably well captures the magnitude as well as the spatial distribution at annual scale however it is unable to reproduce higher et rates of kashmir valley encapsulated between two mountainous series similarly at seasonal scale the ssebop dataset shows higher ability to present spatial patterns with overestimation in all seasons except winter where et rates are underestimated apart from autumn season performance of dolce dataset is better than other gridded datasets in terms of magnitude and spatial patterns the average annual reference et for the period 2003 2014 was 550 mm year over entire ujb fig 6 a the gldas noah and mod16a2 showed higher discrepancies with 33 and 27 positive and negative biases respectively the other three datasets dolce ssebop terraclimate performed better with biases in the range of 7 6 12 6 for seasonal distribution in terms of magnitude et datasets show less consistency fig 6b than the p datasets fig 3b especially for winter season the summer season contributes for the largest part to annual et due to availability of sufficient energy and moisture in the form of temperature and monsoon p respectively the contribution of spring season to annual et reduces slightly due to slight reduction in energy availability for extraction of water from water bodies and soil moisture in comparison the seasonal distribution of terraclimate dolce and gldas noah are similar to the reference et dataset fig 6b similarly temporal distribution of reference and all gridded et datasets vary in terms of monthly evolution and magnitude as shown in fig 6c generally all datasets perform better in relatively cold months from november to february than warm months from april to september moreover all datasets underestimate et at the lower end winter months but overestimate et at the higher end summer season except mod16a2 which underestimates et at both the low and high ends fig 6c the terraclimate and dolce datasets show similar evolution of et as reference with one month delayed in peak values mod16a2 shows the largest discrepancy with reference et in terms of temporal distribution and magnitude mostly dampens monthly variations with underestimation of et ranges by approximately 70 the statistical error metrics for et gridded datasets are presented via taylor diagram fig 6d the colors in fig 6d represent the different gridded datasets and the shape represents the temporal scale at which comparison was made at monthly and seasonal scale all datasets relatively perform well except mod16a2 whereas none of the gridded datasets is able to develop a good correlation at annual scale the dolce outperformed over other datasets with r 0 78 0 79 crmse 0 75 0 8 and nsd 1 25 at a temporal resolution of month and season the ssebop dataset was well correlated with reference dataset r 0 82 0 86 but has higher crmse and nsd et across ujb varies in response to atmospheric forcing and moisture availability on snow and earth surfaces the direct estimation of et over mountainous regions like north part of ujb is complicated due to the absence of ground stations at high altitudes and high topographic heterogeneity for the same reason absolute et estimates are very few and highly uncertain despite of its crucial importance in twb cycle an indirect approach of estimating et as a residual of twb equation has also been applied to alpine high altitude regions builes jaramillo and poveda 2018 li et al 2019 however the reliability of et estimated from twb equation depends on the accuracy of other hydrological variables for example p runoff and total water storage change as there are few p stations constrained by uneven distribution at low altitudes therefore this approach can provide highly uncertain estimates in this study a hybrid approach integrating ground based measurement with rs based vegetation indices was used to estimate et this approach has been widely used for the estimation of et at large scale bryla et al 2010 johnson et al 2016 johnson and trout 2012 trout et al 2008 although results of this method are not as accurate as flux tower estimates they provide good agreement with lysimetric and flux tower measurement bryla et al 2010 johnson et al 2016 the average annual reference et for the period 2003 2014 was 550 mm year over ujb fig 6a which is very close to the et estimates provided by immerzeel et al 2015 lutz et al 2016 and bastiaanssen et al 2012 regarding gridded et datasets the performance of terraclimate and dolce seems better in terms of magnitude as well as spatial temporal distribution with higher correlation coefficient however the spatial distributions of terraclimte were found to be inferior to dolce whereas the temporal distribution of dolce was found to be inferior to terraclimate the gldas noah and ssebop datasets overestimated the reference et which seems unrealistic over partially snow fed basins the mod16a2 data was unable to present spatial as well as temporal patterns of et the underestimation of mod16a2 et was also reported by bookhagen and burbank 2010 over uib and other parts of the world the differences between reference and gridded et datasets are associated with errors and uncertainties in their forcing input parameters production mechanism and lack of calibrated ground observations in remote areas moreira et al 2019 for instance the satellite derived land surface temperature lst used in ssebop and mod16a2 has larger uncertainties over mountainous region due to cloud cover snow effect and conversion of instantaneous to daily values senay et al 2013 which further results in significant et errors moreover mod16a2 algorithm uses vapour pressure deficit as water stress input instead of p and soil moisture which would be overestimated for higher soil water content resulting in the underestimated soil evaporation and canopy transpiration hu et al 2015 although terraclimate and gldas noah land surface model also uses p as forcing input parameter yet p itself present larger uncertainties over mountainous region corresponding to complex topography xia et al 2015b 5 3 grace derived terrestrial water storage change the grace derived twsa and calculated twsc time series from jpl m and csr m of rl06 over ujb are shown in fig 7 these datasets show similar patterns with significant correlation coefficient of r 0 85 and r 0 81 for twsa and twsc respectively the slight differences in two datasets are owed to different approaches for the application of spatiotemporal constraints and scale of the grid cells https grace jpl nasa gov data choosing a solution as expected a strong seasonal fluctuation in tws with maximum in spring and minimum in winter was observed the state of gain in tws was observed after the onset of long p spell as a bimodal p pattern exists in the basin two peaks were observed in a year at the positive ends of tws the tws increases with the onset of spring p in the form of snow and reaches its maximum at the end of spring season afterwards tws tends to decrease with the melting of snow the ujb is known as an early riser as its snowmelt season starts in march to april before peaking in june and july a month earlier than the indus the early onset of snowmelt in ujb is attributed to the warming scenarios in western himalaya this is consistent with research that claims there has been glacial mass balance loss in the western himalaya due to an increase in temperature and the retreat has been faster in the karakorum and hindukush regions lv et al 2017 the tws again tends to increase with the start of monsoon p with a smaller peak in august the decline in tws from the end of monsoon p is translated into the removal of water from storage through rapidly generating streamflow evaporation from water bodies and transpiration from plants overall both datasets showed slight declining trend in tws in the basin during the studied period 2003 2014 at the rate of 0 0214 mm month and 0 0119 mm month for jpl m and csr m datasets respectively this decreasing trend was attributed to land use changes and changing p pattern due to global warming saddique et al 2020b the twsc was calculated using the backward difference equation eq 2 the long term twsc remained stable during the studied period 2003 2014 the csr m data shows more variations in twsc at both end peaks than jpl m the shaded area in fig 7 presents the uncertainty in datasets the higher uncertainty was observed for the jpl m derived twsa which may be attributed to the low spatial resolution the basin averaged uncertainty estimates of csr m derived twsa calculated from residuals of time series decomposition was comparable to the value recommended by csr institute 2 cm in water height in each 0 5 grid globally the results were also supported by the findings of xie et al 2019 and yoon et al 2019 over yarlung tsangpo river basin and hma respectively 5 4 twb dynamics and uncertainties in its components in this section the adequacy of different combinations of selected gridded p and et datasets to close the water budget was analyzed for this purpose twsc was calculated as a residual of water budget equation equation 1 hereafter referred as wb twsc and compared with csr m and jpl m derived twsc table 5 shows the correlation coefficient between wb twsc and two grace datasets csr m twsc and jpl m twsc the observed q time series was used in water budget equation for all p and et datasets pairs it is clearly seen that the wb twsc was better correlated with csr m twsc than jpl m twsc for all p and et datasets regarding p datasets the highest correlation coefficient between wb twsc and csr m twsc was obtained with era5 dataset followed by reference p dataset in context of et datasets the use of dolce in water budget equation provides better correlation coefficient the highest correlation coefficient and least imbalance was achieved with the combination of era5 and dolce datasets this shows the higher ability of era5 and dolce to close the water budget than reference datasets the graphical representation of csr m twsc and wb twsc along with monthly water fluxes of era5 dolce and observed q is shown in fig 8 a the bimodal p pattern with peaks in winter and summer season was observed the et patterns in the basin showed a single peak in summer season due to availability of sufficient energy and soil moisture in the form of temperature and monsoon p respectively during winter season the limited energy availability for the extraction of water from water bodies and soil moisture lower the et rates despite of enough moisture availability the temporal distribution of q showed a single peak usually in spring season when snowmelt combines with rainfall runoff the snowmelt in the ujb starts in march to april a month earlier than the uib as a result of increasing warming rates in the western himalayas a second smaller peak in the q was observed in the summer season for the 2006 and 2014 years these peaks were a result of intense monsoon rainfall which cause flooding conditions in the basin the twsc also exhibits two gaining peaks which coincides with the p peaks in winter and summer season the two losing peaks in twsc showed relatively dry season than winter and summer season it can also be seen that basin twsc exhibits strong seasonal fluctuations but changes in p are not obvious a comparison of the wb twsc and csr m twsc as time series reveals that both exhibit seasonal changes and demonstrate a fluctuating feature with a correlation coefficient of 0 81 however discrepancies are higher at both gaining and losing ends of peaks the imbalance or non closure errors imbalance p et q twsc varies in the range of 141 26 to 81 08 mm month with the median being close to 17 22 mm month and shows a seasonal cycle fig 8b more high values of imbalance were found at the positive side as compared to negative a higher positive imbalance was observed for the winter season where there are high p and least et rates on the other hand higher negative imbalance was observed in the summer season where high q and et rates respectively produced two peaks in wb twsc at losing ends this may be explained with the higher uncertainties of p during wet seasons as it can be seen in fig 8c the uncertainties of each twb component and their contribution to the overall uncertainty in the basin q computed by the error propagation equation are depicted in fig 8c the uncertainty of q is in the range of 22 96 to 118 46 mm per month with the largest error coming from the p the higher uncertainties contribution from p was also documented by many researchers around the world moreira et al 2019 xie et al 2019 yoon et al 2019 in general era5 data tend to overestimate p especially wet seasons when compared to reference dataset fig 3c the p uncertainty varies between 2 99 and 116 17 mm month the high values of uncertainties of p are also attributed to the under catches p and lack of in situ gauge stations over snow fed parts of the basin the uncertainty of et varies from 6 44 to 31 12 mm month and has been calculated through the same method as p irrespective of p the uncertainty of et remains consistent throughout the period regarding the uncertainties in csr m derived twsc our estimate of basin average uncertainty is 19 6 mm month which is near to the value recommended by institute 2 cm in water height in each 0 5 grid globally similar estimates of uncertainties are reported over yarlung tsangpo river basin in southwest of china xie et al 2019 and hma yoon et al 2019 xie et al 2019 estimated the uncertainties in p et and q to be in the range of 0 7 119 7 mm month 1 76 41 0 mm month and 8 60 122 0 mm month respectively across the hma yoon et al 2019 reported mean annual uncertainty to be 0 45 0 11 and 0 36 mm day for p et and q respectively 5 5 trend analysis the annual and seasonal trend maps of p et and tws were prepared using mk test results the lag 1 serial correlation coefficients of each pixel time series were calculated before applying mk trend test among the 79 pixels of study region significant lag 1 serial correlation exists at ten pixels of annual et in seasonal time series significant serial correlations were more pronounced in summer series the pre whitening process of serially correlated time series is commonly used to eliminate the effects of serial correlation before trend analysis yue et al 2002 however the controversies still exists about its utility for hydro meteorological time series as it leads to a loss of important information contained in a time series and reduces the power of the test when a trend exists razavi and vogel 2018 a simulation study carried out by bayazit and önöz 2007 documented that pre whitening should be applied except for large samples n 50 or when the coefficient of variation is very small as our sample size was small the pre whitening of the serially correlated time series was done using yue et al 2002 approach the annual and seasonal trend maps of three twb components is shown in fig 9 overall both upward and downward trends in annual p were detected and their magnitude vary between 21 00 to 48 00 mm year specifically the annual p tended to increase in the lower part of basin and decrease in the north west higher altitudes of the basin during the study period the increase and decrease in p in lower and upper part of the basins was attributed to the increase in summer monsoon and decrease in westerlies p respectively as clearly seen in seasonal trend maps however these positive and negative changes in p were not significant in most part of the basin at seasonal scale the non significant mixed trends were found in most part of the basin with a few significant positive pixels for all seasons except winter where significant decreasing trends were detected for most part of the basin at either 0 1 or 0 05 significance level contrasting results of p trends over greater himalaya were found in literature shrestha 2000 and archer and fowler 2004 reported no significant evidence of long term trend either increasing or decreasing over the nepalese himalaya and uib for the period of 1948 1994 and 1895 1999 respectively dimri and dash 2012 and kumar and jain 2010 also reported large scale decadal variation with increasing and decreasing p over himalaya however significant increasing trend were found for winter p october to march from 1961 to 1999 archer and fowler 2004 the results of our study are consistent with azmat 2015 who reported decreasing tendency τ 0 034 of snow cover area sca in winter over an altitude of 4000 m in ujb for the period of 2000 2010 the snow cover shrinkage tendency in high elevation areas of the himalayan range were also found by berthier et al 2007 recent studies conducted by zaz et al 2019 and shafiq et al 2020 on indian side ujb also showed decreasing trends of winter and spring p the contradictions in p trends are due to the study period as historic trend may not persist in future milly et al 2008 for instance the inclusion of 2000 2003 severe drought years in archer and fowler 2004 study may change the statistical significance of the trend regarding et trends over ujb or even uib very few studies were found in literature the results of mk statistics for et are presented in fig 9 a mixed trend for annual et with a magnitude of 8 0 to 5 50 mm year was observed for seasonal trends winter and spring seasons show decreasing and increasing trends at high and low altitude areas respectively whereas opposite trends are observed for summer season low turbulence of air due to a declining trend in wind velocity may be one explanation for dropping et rates at high altitudes akbar and gheewala 2020 despite of warming in himalaya as reported by many researchers zaz et al 2019 moreover the increasing trend in temperature did not necessarily cause an increase in et tamaddun et al 2019 moreira et al 2019 also observed that the et rates are regulated by a radiation balance p rates and vegetation physiological control rather than being exclusively limited by one of these factors the annual tws tended to decrease with a magnitude of 2 32 to 7 25 mm year in the basin at either 0 1 or 0 05 significance level despite the increase in annual p over lower part of the basin monsoon dominated tws shows declining trend even at higher significance level p greater than 0 05 this may be due to the rapidly generating rainfall runoff that leaves less time for recharging groundwater moreover the changes in lulc reduction in agricultural area in valleys and increase in settlement also reduce the infiltration to soil saddique et al 2020b shafiq et al 2020 at seasonal scale tws was decreasing during winter and spring seasons however significant decline was detected only for winter season for the summer and autumn seasons nonsignificant increasing trends were observed for most parts of the basin with a few pixels of slightly decreasing slope the tws are directly linked to amount and form of p the decreasing tws in winter and spring season directly linked to decrease p of the same seasons the study area has also witnessed the significant loss in glacierized area with kolahai receding by around 23 6 from 1962 to 2018 rashid et al 2020 and nehnar lost nearly half of its area from 1962 to 2017 shafiq et al 2020 the robustness of these gridded p et and tws trends analysis depends on how accurately the given gridded dataset represents the basin behavior in space and time in present study the selected gridded p era5 et dolce and twsa csr m datasets performed well in direct comparison against reference point data at monthly seasonal and annual scale the suitability and reliability of era5 has also been reported by many researchers over ujb and surrounding regions ansari and grossi 2022 arshad et al 2021 liaqat et al 2022 baudouin et al 2020 whereas the doce et estimates are consistent with the previous studies conducted over larger scale than ujb lutz et al 2016 immerzeel et al 2015 bastiaanssen et al 2012 notwithstanding era5 overestimates the observed basin fig 3a and 3c it accurately reproduces the seasonal distribution and presents least temporal differences against observed gauge data fig 3b and 3d the overestimation of era5 against observed data is defensible and can be explained with low density unevenly distributed station network lying at low altitudes which mostly received liquid p whereas the hydrologically active part of the basin remained ungauged baudouin et al 2020 shafeeque et al 2019 khan and koch 2018 immerzeel et al 2015 azmat 2015 moreover among all p datasets era5 p has the highest sufficiency to sustain the water balance with dolce et and csr m tws datasets table 5 immerzeel et al 2015 and shafeeque et al 2019 also argue that the observed p over uib is underestimated and the water balance closure can be achieved only if the p in gridded datasets is 2 8 times greater than the observed p in these datasets at higher altitudes the overestimation of gridded dataset could be different owing to the use of different p datasets different size and location of study areas and different mass balance values overall because of the limited number of climatic stations at high altitudes of the ujb the era5 proves to be a good alternative of observed precipitation for further implications in impact studies which needs continuous precipitation estimates in space and time the results of mk statistics for monthly seasonal and annual q time series are shown in fig 10 the increasing trends were detected for all months of the year except january and february where runoff shows decreasing trend however this increase or decrease in monthly q is insignificant but for september which is significant at 0 05 significance level in terms of seasonal trends statistically insignificant upward and downward trends were observed for summer autumn and winter spring seasons respectively the possible reason behind the insignificant increase in march to may months q was attributed to the early onset of snow melting due to warming scenarios in western himalaya as reported by many researchers rashid et al 2020 shafiq et al 2020 zaz et al 2019 wescoat jr et al 2018 also reported the expected shift of jhelum hydrograph to earlier q about one month earlier than the indus river whereas the insignificant decreasing trend over spring season may correspond to the decreasing trend of winter p for annual q time series a positive yet insignificant trend with a magnitude of 5 7 mm year was observed primarily the increase in annual q is predominantly caused by increasing monsoon p from low altitude areas the results of annual q trend are concurrent with wescoat jr et al 2018 who found increase in q for the period 2001 2016 despite of overall decreasing trend for the 1922 2016 6 conclusion with reference to above analysis the major conclusions of this study can be summarized as follows the spatial patterns and seasonal distribution of p were reasonably well captured by all gridded p datasets however huge discrepancies in the mean estimates were found across these datasets era5 pdataset was considered to be the most appropriate to present p behavior over ujb in space and time despite its overestimation against reference dataset the underlying reasons for this selection lie in its better performance in terms of time series disparities r nsd crmse while the observed average p due to lack of climate stations over snow fed parts of the basins governing et its absolute estimates are very few and highly ambiguous over entire uib including ujb due to absence of flux towers and high topographic heterogeneity high discrepancies were observed spatially and temporally for all gridded et datasets as compared to p datasets among all gridded et datasets dolce performed reasonably well in terms of magnitude as well as of spatiotemporal distribution yet it is unable to represent the high et rates of kashmir valley encapsulated between two mountainous series small differences were found in twsc derived from csr m and jpl m of rl06 r o 89 however the csr m shows higher correlation coefficients when compared to water balance derived twsc for all p and et combinations the results indicate that the grace mascon solutions with finer spatial resolution also provide a satisfactory result for small basins high uncertainties in twb estimates cause imbalance or non closure errors the major contribution to imbalance arises from p mainly during the wet seasons this shows the significant need to adjust p estimates before using it for impact assessment studies contradictions in p trends over greater himalaya are present in the literature these contrasting results might be due to different datasets and study periods used for trend analysis in each work in present study non significant mixed trends in annul p at a rate of 21 00 to 48 00 mm year were observed with increase and decrease in monsoon and winter p respectively the decrease in winter p was found to be significant throughout the basin at either 0 1 or 0 05 significance level whereas statistically non significant increasing trends were observed for all other seasons in context to et mixed yet statistically significant trends were detected in different parts of the basin at annual and seasonal scale the mixed trends despite of the increasing temperature in western himalaya demonstrate that higher et rates do not correspond to higher temperature rates and vice versa but they are influenced by a number of factors such as balance of radiations p rates and vegetation physiological control the tws shows a significant decreasing trend throughout the ujb in winter and annual scale at either 0 1 or 0 05 significance level the decreasing trend in winter season is directly linked to the decreasing trend of winter p and loss of glacier mass due to global warming in western himalaya however the decreasing trend in annual tws despite of the increasing p in low altitudes areas is due to rapidly generating runoff that leaves less time for recharging groundwater the q at mangla station showed increasing trends in all months of the year except january and february during the 2003 2014 corresponding to precipitation trends the early snow melting in combination with increasing p trends especially in monsoon dominated regions are primarily reasons of q increase credit authorship

2871,improving the understanding of the future hydrological drought variability in cascade reservoirs area is indispensable for water resource management especially in the context of changing climate this study aims to investigate the hydrological drought variations in the upper yellow river basin uyrb during 2021 2100 employing the latest coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 cmip6 datasets the study area is divided into three sub regions based on the location of the two large reservoirs i e region 1 r1 and region 2 r2 have reservoirs while region 3 r3 has none the meteorological data from 10 cmip6 models are downscaled by utilizing the bias corrected spatial disaggregation bcsd method and then used to force the improved abcd hydrological model for future monthly runoff simulations the changes in severity duration and frequency of drought events in three sub regions under two future climate scenarios ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 relative to the historical period are identified then the copula function is applied to explore the changes in probabilities of spatially concurrent drought for different cases in the future the most likely combination of drought intensity for r1 and r2 corresponding to 10 years conditional return periods is estimated to demonstrate changes in drought risks across the reservoir areas results show that the drought frequency of r2 and r3 is expected to increase in spring and summer and the drought events are projected to have a shorter duration and lower severity overall under two scenarios additionally the spring probabilities of concurrent drought for different cases are expected to increase in the near future increase by 1 9 19 3 but only increase in r2 r3 case in the far future it is noted that although the drought probabilities will decrease in winter r1 and r2 are expected to experience more severe drought when drought occurs in r3 the findings are helpful to improve the understanding of future hydrological drought risk in the uyrb and provide guidelines for making adaptation strategies to climate change keywords climate change cmip6 hydrological drought drought projection spatially concurrent drought data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction global climate change influences the occurrence of extreme events turner et al 2016 drought defined as the anomaly shortage of water is one of the major natural disasters that threaten the stability of ecosystems and the social economy mishra and singh 2010 wu et al 2022 according to statistics on the number of people affected and the economic losses drought has ranked first among all natural disasters leng et al 2015 han et al 2021 explored meteorological drought variations in china from 1961 to 2014 and they found that china s drought events had a higher frequency greater severity and larger affected area after the 1990s than those experienced in the past due to climate change revealing future drought variations under the backdrop of continuously increasing global temperature has become a hot issue which is imperative for the development of adaptation strategies to climate change gu et al 2020 zhang et al 2021a generally drought can be categorized into four types including meteorological agricultural hydrological and socio economic drought according to the deficit of different water cycle variables mishra and singh 2010 among these types hydrological drought mainly manifested as abnormally low runoff can directly threaten public water supplements zhang et al 2022 a previous study indicated that streamflow showed a decreasing trend in arid and semi arid regions of north china during 1956 2005 zhang et al 2011 which enhanced the urgency for understanding the future hydrological drought variabilities the coupled model intercomparison project cmip organized by the world climate research programme wcrp has become the most widely used and influential data source for exploring future climate change and water resources evolution wang et al 2021 based on the cmip5 researchers analyzed future hydrological drought variations in different watersheds for example ahmadalipour et al 2017 used 10 cmip5 gcms to analyze the future changes in hydrological drought characteristics in the willamette river basin u s and indicated that the duration and severity were expected to increase similarly jiao and yuan 2019 concluded that the wudinghe watershed china would experience more severe hydrological drought in the future gu et al 2020 investigated the impacts of future climate change on hydrological drought characteristics in 151 typical catchments over china and showed that both duration and severity would increase in central and southern china but decrease in northeast china and western alpine regions the patterns of future hydrological drought changes were inconsistent across different watersheds recent released cmip6 has been proven that can provide more reasonable future scenarios by integrating the shared socioeconomic pathways ssps and representative concentration pathways rcps qin et al 2021 since the better performance in climate extremes analysis the cmip6 become popular in recent studies for china s meteorological drought projections song et al 2021 su et al 2021a xu et al 2021 however studies of hydrological drought based on cmip6 were still limited recently zeng et al 2022 and wang et al 2021 explored the duration and severity of future hydrological drought events using cmip6 datasets but their studies were focused on a global scale which was insufficient to provide detailed information for water resources management at the watershed scale consequently the hydrological drought variations need to be further explored especially at the subbasin scale which is the spatial scale relevant to water decisions and policy sun et al 2019 due to the complexity of drought researchers emphasized the necessity of drought assessment in terms of multidimensional properties wang et al 2020a zhang et al 2021b to date copula based methods for frequency analysis have been recognized as an effective way to quantify drought risks from a multivariate perspective previous studies usually adopted the copula function to construct the joint distribution of various characteristics of drought events e g the duration severity and affected area and further estimate the return periods feng et al 2021 wang et al 2020b xu et al 2021 however it was still limited in terms of understanding drought events since they only focused on the multivariate drought characteristics in the same region zhao et al 2021 yang et al 2019 emphasized the necessity of a comprehensive understanding of drought events from several hydrological stations visser quinn et al 2019 proposed a framework for the identification of compound hydro hazard hotspots and defined the concept of spatially compound hydro hazard which provided a new perspective for drought analysis the spatially compound drought representing that drought occurs simultaneously in more than one area can pose a greater risk than that only occurs in isolated areas for example the frequent concurrent drought event in water source and destination regions can impact the sustainability of water diversion systems consequently the probability of spatially concurrent drought should be also integrated into the risk assessment framework liu et al 2015 estimated the probability of concurrent drought events between the water source and destination regions of china s south to north water diversion project zhang et al 2017 investigated the characteristics of concurrent hydrological drought events in the poyang lake catchment river system which was helpful to understand the inherent mechanism of hydrological extremes zhao et al 2021 applied the copula based method to reveal the drought encounter risks among three china s major grain production zones these studies have further improved the understanding of multivariate characteristics of drought but studies on how climate change affects probabilities of concurrent hydrological drought in the 21st century are still scarce which is important for drought risk management especially in a cascade reservoirs area the yellow river basin yrb plays a fundamental role in water supply in north western and northern china but it is also one of the most water stressed basins in the world li et al 2020b found that the yrb experienced increasingly serious hydrological drought in the last few decades which caused adverse impacts on economic development besides omer et al 2020 suggested that the water scarcity of the yrb would intensify in the coming decades the upper yrb uyrb producing nearly 57 5 of the water of the entire basin plays important role in industrial agricultural and domestic water supply zhao et al 2009 meanwhile the uyrb is also an important hydropower energy base in china where many large reservoirs have been built the longyangxia and liujiaxia with multi year and annual regulation ability respectively are two pivotal reservoirs in the uyrb these two reservoirs are important to power generation water supply flood control and ecological sustainability across the whole yrb bai et al 2015 however the drought showed an increasing trend during 1961 2015 wang et al 2020a which caused negative impacts on water supply and hydroelectricity due to the importance of the uyrb in the socio economic system clarifying the future variations of hydrological drought is of great interest in light of these issues the objective of the current study is to provide some new insights compared to previous drought assessments in the uyrb differing mainly in the following aspects we adopted the latest cmip6 datasets to evaluate the hydrological drought in the uyrb whereas previous studies were implemented based on cmip5 moreover future hydrological drought evolutions were explored from a perspective of spatially concurrent extreme events in this study whereas past studies primarily focused on independent regions namely we were more focused on the concurrent hydrological drought variations the concurrent drought in the current study represents that hydrological drought can be simultaneously observed at 2 or 3 sub regions divided by reservoirs in the uyrb the motivation of this study is to answer two questions 1 how will climate changes affect the hydrological drought characteristics including duration severity and frequency in the uyrb 2 how will the probabilities of spatially concurrent hydrological drought events be changing in the 21st century the study is designed as follows section 1 introduces the challenges and aims of the study section 2 describes the study area and relevant datasets section 3 presents the framework and methodology of this study the results of the current study are performed in section 4 and the discussions and main conclusions are summarized in section 5 and section 6 respectively 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the yrb is one of the largest basins in china the uyrb controlled by the lanzhou lz hydrological station with an area of 222 551 km2 was selected as our study area fig 1 the annual precipitation and temperature of the uyrb were nearly 446 mm and 0 89 c respectively many reservoirs have been built to guarantee enough power generation irrigation consumption and domestic water for the downstream area thus the frequent hydrological drought in the uyrb can directly impact the water supply of the total yrb the liujiaxia ljx and longyangxia lyx reservoirs with effective storage capacities of 193 6 108 m3 and 35 108 m3 respectively are the large control water projects in the study area su et al 2021b here the study area was divided into three sub regions region 1 r1 represents the area above the lyx reservoir and region 2 r2 donates the area between the ljx reservoir and the lyx reservoir while region 3 r3 is the area between the ljx reservoir and lz station according to the location of reservoirs the runoff of r1 and r2 can be regulated by the lyx and ljx respectively while that of r3 cannot be regulated by a large reservoir the subsequent analysis of concurrent drought events was based on these three sub regions 2 2 data the datasets adopted in this study include meteorological data and streamflow data we collected historic meteorological data from the 0 25 0 25 grided dataset named cn05 1 during a period from 1970 to 2010 the cn05 1 dataset https ccrc iap ac cn resource detail id 228 produced by wu and gao 2013 based on the recorded data of 2400 meteorological stations in china provides meteorological data such as precipitation temperature relative humidity wind speed etc the accuracy of cn05 1 dataset had been validated in previous study wu and gao 2013 then the natural streamflow data of tangnaihai tnh xiaochuan xc and lz stations fig 1 from 1970 to 1990 was obtained from the yellow river conservancy commission here the natural streamflow is the observed streamflow plus the anthropic water use which excludes the influences of direct human activities for future meteorological data it was collected from coupled model inter comparison project phase 6 cmip6 gcms outputs from the world climate research project https esgf node llnl gov projects cmip6 in the current study 10 cmip6 models listed in table 1 were selected because of their good performance in china zhang et al 2021a also two ssp scenarios i e ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 representing the scenarios with 1 5 c and 2 0 c increase in the future were considered for each model moreover the cmip5 datasets under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios were obtained from the world climate research project https esgf node llnl gov projects cmip5 3 methods as mentioned in the section of the introduction we are interested in the future changes in hydrological drought characteristics based on cmip6 fig 2 displays a flowchart of this study and the subsections below present a detailed introduction of the methods 3 1 downscaling of cmip6 dataset when focusing on watershed scale results the post processing i e bias correction and downscaling of cmip6 data is necessary because of its error and rough spatial resolution the bias corrected spatial disaggregation bcsd method wood et al 2002 widely applicated in gcms outputs downscaling was adopted to downscale the cmip6 dataset in the current study the method contains two step including bias correction and spatial downscaling firstly the inverse distance weighted idw method was used to make the cn05 1 dataset have a low resolution with the gcm dataset then the gcm dataset was corrected to match with the cumulative distribution function cdf of the cn05 1 dataset the bias corrected gcm datasets were then disaggregated to high spatial resolution as same as the cn05 1 dataset i e 0 25 by this the correction factors could be estimated by the observation and high resolution gcm dataset moreover the statical indicators of nash sutcliffe efficiency nse the correlation coefficient r and the mean absolute error mae were used to evaluate the accuracy of downscaled results 3 2 hydrological simulation to understand the future hydrological drought variations it is necessary to apply downscaled cmip6 data to force hydrological model for streamflow simulation the abcd model developed by thomas 1981 is very popular in streamflow simulation since of its high accuracy and simple structures wang et al 2017 indicated that the abcd model performed well in the uyrb and used the model to evaluate future streamflow variations to improve the accuracy of runoff simulation we also utilized the abcd model but integrated a simple snow melt module to make it i e improved abcd model more realistic in revealing the hydrological processes in our study area the snow melt module was referred to the approach of chen et al 2017 but it was carried out on a monthly scale the improved abcd model takes monthly precipitation potential evapotranspiration and air temperature as input and has six parameters that need to be calibrated a detailed information can be found in fig s1 the potential evapotranspiration was computed by using the penman monteith equation monteith and unsworth 1990 here we used the shuffled complex evolution algorithm duan et al 1994 to obtain the best model parameters and then applied three classic indicators including the nse the coefficient of determination r2 and the percent bias pbias to evaluate the model accuracy guo et al 2021 the parameters were calibrated based on a station by station method to reflect their spatial heterogeneity then the runoff of three sub regions was obtained based on the interval runoff and the proportion of the area controlled by reservoirs and hydrological stations 3 3 drought evaluation the standardized runoff index sri developed by shukla and wood 2008 is popular in hydrological drought assessment because of its simple calculations and flexibility at different timescales the index is computed by fitting a cumulative probability density function based on more than 30 years of runoff records previous studies indicated that the log normal distribution showed good performance in fitting streamflow series wu et al 2018 zhang et al 2021b accordingly the log normal distribution was determined to calculate sri series in this study the fitting performance of the log normal distribution function in three sub regions was checked using the kolmogorov smirnov test shown in fig s2 the theoretical and empirical cumulative distribution frequency showed high consistency and the results also passed the kolmogorov smirnov test p 0 01 we computed the sri at 3 month scale sri3 and 12 month scale sri12 to evaluate the intensity of seasonal and annual drought conditions the run theory yevjevich 1967 was utilized to obtain the severity and duration of drought events the study period was divided into three subperiods i e 1971 2010 2021 2060 and 2061 2100 that represented historical near future and far future periods respectively of note was that the future sri series was estimated based on the historical distribution parameters to highlight the impact of climate change on hydrological drought in detail the future sri series were calculated by future 2021 2100 runoff and the distribution parameters estimated by historical 1970 2010 data here the threshold of the drought was determined by 0 5 namely a drought event started once the sri value was less than 0 5 3 4 joint probability of concurrent drought the calculations of the joint probability of concurrent drought include two steps 1 selecting the marginal distribution and parameters for each sri series 2 determining the optimal copula function and estimating the joint probability distribution of encounter drought events in the current study four widely used distributions for drought analysis including normal nor generalized extreme value gev logistic log and extreme value ev were adopted as the candidate marginal functions and the optimal one was determined by kolmogorov smirnov test the copula function can flexibly establish the joint probability distribution of multi dimensional variables nelsen 1998 wu et al 2021 which here was used to compute the probability of concurrent drought among the uyrb the joint distribution can be summarized as 1 f x 1 x 2 x n c f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 f n x n where f x 1 x 2 x n and f i x i i 1 n represent the joint cumulative distribution function and marginal univariate cumulative distribution function respectively the c donates the copula function for simplicity and representativeness three archimedean copulas gumbel frank and clayton were used as the candidate functions since their wide applications chang et al 2016 and the optimal one was obtained by the akaike information criteria aic value akaike 1973 since the study area was divided into three sub regions there were four cases of concurrent drought events i e a drought occurred simultaneously in pairwise two regions case 1 to 3 or all three regions case 4 for the case 1 to 3 the joint probability f x y of concurrent drought can be estimated as 2 f x y p x x y y c f x x f y y where p and c represent the probability density function and the copula function respectively x and y are the sri of two sub regions while f x x f y y are the marginal distribution of sri series correspondingly for the concurrent drought probability of three regions it can be computed by following the eq 3 3 f x y z p x x y y z z c f x x f y y f z z where f z z represent the marginal distribution of sri for the third sub region besides since the runoff of r1 and r2 can be regulated by reservoirs we also consider the case case 5 that r1 and r2 simultaneously experience drought under the premise that drought occurs in r3 the probabilities can be estimated as follow 4 p x x y y z z f x y z f z the return period can be calculated by the following formula 5 t x x y y z z u p x x y y z z where u is the average inter arrival time of the drought occurrences moreover to provide useful guidelines for reservoirs operation we computed the most likely scenario for case 5 under a specific return period based on the highest condition joint density which could be estimated as follow 6 x y z z arg m a x f x y z f z z c f x x f y y f z z f x x f y y where f x y z is the joint probability density function of sri series for three sub regions c f x x f y y f z z donates the density function of the copula and f x x f y y and f z z represent probability density functions of sri series of r1 r2 and r3 respectively 4 result 4 1 changes of future hydro meteorological variables we first validated the accuracy of downscaled meteorological data and hydrological modeling and the results were presented in fig s3 and fig s4 respectively the bcsd method has a good performance in our study area that the nse and r of these downscaled variables from different gcms are all more than 0 8 and 0 9 respectively according to the evaluation criteria recommended by moriasi et al 2007 the improved abcd model has a very good performance in the study area since the nse and r2 are more than 0 8 and the pbias is less than 5 during the calibration and validation period moreover the improved model shows higher nse and r than the original model and the variations between recorded data and runoff simulated by the improved model are more closely compared to that simulated by the original model especially during the non flood period indicating that the improved model can provide more reliable results for future hydrological drought evaluation changes in future projected annual precipitation potential evapotranspiration and temperature variables over three regions are shown in fig 3 generally these three variables all show an increasing trend under two scenarios and the magnitudes under ssp5 8 5 are more significant than those under ssp2 4 5 especially in the far future according to the average results changes in precipitation potential evapotranspiration and temperature in three regions are all expected to increase by a range of 40 99 mm 197 438 mm and 1 5 4 47 c respectively and the changes in precipitation of r1 are more visible than other regions also the future runoff is simulated based on the downscaled meteorological data and hydrological model and the changes are exhibited in fig 3 d it is noted that the runoff changes have high uncertainty that both richer and poorer runoff can be observed due to the forcing data from different gcms from the average results of different gcms the runoff will change with a range between 0 2 mm and 3 6 mm in the near future while rich runoff would be observed in the far future with a range of 0 4 16 1 mm and the magnitudes of future runoff changes in r1 are more noticeable than those in r2 and r3 which show a similar pattern with precipitation 4 2 characteristics of future hydrological drought the severity and duration of drought events under two scenarios in three sub regions were estimated shown in fig 4 the mean drought severity of three sub regions is expected to decrease from a range of 5 9 8 0 to a range of 3 3 6 1 while the mean drought duration is projected to be shortened from 5 8 to 6 6 months to 3 8 5 3 months in r1 and r3 the drought duration of r2 shows a very slight increase only during the near future under ssp5 8 5 thus we infer that the future droughts in the uyrb will alleviate under ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 when compared with historical drought events understandings of drought frequency changes between historical and future periods are also valuable for policy makers here we estimated the frequency of drought occurrence on the annual and seasonal scales for different periods under two scenarios shown in fig 5 the values of sri12 in december were used to reflect the annual drought conditions and values of sri3 in may august november and february were utilized to reflect the drought conditions of spring summer autumn and winter respectively generally future droughts are more likely to occur in spring and the frequency of drought in the far future is generally lower than that in the near future besides the frequency of drought in three sub regions is also projected to decrease in autumn and winter for the annual drought events we found a lower frequency in r1 and r2 and a higher frequency in r3 in the future compared to the historical period meanwhile the frequency of drought for spring and summer will increase in r2 and r3 while it is projected to be lower in r1 for example the mean frequency of drought for spring during the historical period was 45 27 5 and 27 5 in the r1 r2 and r3 respectively while it was estimated at 38 5 and 29 5 in the r1 48 5 and 36 3 in the r2 and 48 and 35 in the r3 during the 2021 2060 and 2061 2100 respectively under ssp2 4 5 it is worth noting that changes in drought frequency under different scenarios are not always consistent for example the frequency of spring drought in the r2 at the near future shows increasing and decreasing trends under ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 respectively moreover the frequency obtained from different gcms exhibits a large discrepancy 4 3 risks of future concurrent hydrological drought 4 3 1 probability of historical concurrent drought event the kolmogorov smirnov test was applied to determine the optimal marginal for the sri series and the results were shown in table 2 the statistics of the dmax for four distributions are lower than the critical values indicating that these distributions all show good performance among these the dmax values of gev and log distribution are generally smaller compared with nor and ev distribution then the copula functions were applied to establish the probabilistic relationship for four concurrent drought cases including that drought occurs simultaneously in r1 and r2 r1 r2 r1 and r3 r1 r3 r2 and r3 r2 r3 and r1 r2 and r3 r1 r2 r3 and the aic values of different copulas were listed in table 3 the most suitable copula function for each case was determined by the smallest aic values for example the frank copula has better performance for the case of r1 r2 in annual spring summer and winter while the clayton copula is optimal in autumn based on the joint distribution we estimated the historical probabilities of concurrent drought for four cases shown in table 4 the probabilities of concurrent drought events in three regions are generally lower than the probabilities of any combination of two regions at the annual scale the concurrent drought of cases r1 r2 r1 r3 r2 r3 and r1 r2 r3 occurred 9 7 6 and 5 times respectively while the estimated probabilities were 18 7 12 7 13 3 and 7 7 respectively for seasonal concurrent drought events the highest joint probabilities for r1 r3 can be observed in spring at 20 7 while the highest joint probabilities for other cases are all in autumn ranging between 12 5 and 18 1 overall the copula based results were highly consistent with the records thus the future probabilities of concurrent drought events were also estimated by the same calculation procedure 4 3 2 changes of future probability of concurrent drought events here we exhibited the changes of probabilities for concurrent drought events in the future under two scenarios in table 5 based on the ensemble results it was found that the probabilities for different cases will decrease with change rates ranging between 4 5 and 13 5 in autumn and winter during two future periods while different change patterns could be observed in other seasons for example the ensemble median for probabilities of r2 r3 and r1 r2 r3 cases during 2021 2060 become higher in spring and summer and similar changes can be only found in spring for r1 r2 and r1 r3 cases during 2061 2100 the probabilities of annual spring and summer for r1 r2 and r1 r3 cases show a decrease while it is expected to increase for r2 r3 case in summer overall compared with ssp2 4 5 the probabilities of concurrent drought events for different cases show a greater increase under ssp5 8 5 during the near future while the results of r2 r3 case are the opposite in the far future since the uncertainty of gcms output the changes in runoff based on different sources are not consistent as shown in table 5 discernable differences can be expected for climatic impacts on probabilities changes based on different gcms for example increased probabilities for four cases based on the access esm 1 5 cesm2 gfdl esm4 and mpi esm1 2lr are evident but the results based on ec earth3 miroc6 mri esm2 0 demonstrate a decrease in spring during 2021 2060 since the runoff of r3 cannot be regulated by a large reservoir an interesting question is what the drought intensity in reservoir regions are i e r1 and r2 when r3 experiences drought therefore the risks of concurrent hydrological drought among r2 and r3 under the condition of the drought occurring in the r1 i e case 5 were analyzed based on eq 4 and eq 5 fig 6 illustrates the concurrent drought intensity with a 10 years return period in r1 and r2 during historical near future and far future periods under different scenarios based on different gcms when drought occurs in r3 it was found that the historical contour lines were always located to the lower left of anyone in future autumn representing that future concurrent drought would be mitigated due to climate change besides since the uncertainties of gcms the relationships between the future contour lines and historical one are different specifically compared with the historical one most of future contour lines in annual and summer move to the upper right location and most of the isolines in spring move to the lower left location note that the significant left downward displacement of the future winter contour lines relative to the historical one implying a more severe concurrent drought event in r1 and r2 when drought occurs in r3 under the impacts of climate change we further explore the intensity of most likely drought encounters with a 10 years return period across r1 and r2 when drought occurs in r3 by using eq 6 fig 7 presents the changes in future sri δsri values of r1 and r2 relative to the historical period based on different gcms the relationship between the δsri values of r1 and r2 can be summarized as four types i e both the two values are greater than zero type 1 or less than zero type 2 and the value of r1 type 3 or r2 type 4 is greater than zero while the other is less than zero it is found that most of the results based on different gcms belong to type 1 and type 2 for example during the near future the change patterns of annual summer and autumn are type 1 but those of spring and winter are type 2 under both ssp2 4 5 and spp5 8 5 scenarios for the period of far future most of the change patterns are type 1 representing a lower drought risk besides the ensemble results of summer under ssp5 8 5 and winter under ssp2 4 5 are type 3 suggesting a higher drought risk in the r2 5 discussion since the cmip6 data can reasonably project future climate characteristics of northwest china li et al 2020a the current study explored the future hydrological drought variations in the uyrb using the latest projection climate data from cmip6 interestingly compared with findings based on cmip5 gu et al 2020 omer et al 2020 the current study found that future hydrological drought in the uyrb would be mitigated with a shorter duration and lower severity here we discussed the potential causes for this difference including 1 the version of cmip 2 the selection of gcms model and 3 the calculation methods of potential evapotranspiration a case study from turkey showed that the overall dryness feature of cmip6 became less pronounced in comparison to cmip5 bağçaci et al 2021 chen and yuan 2021 summarized that a larger increase in evapotranspiration projected by cmip5 lead to a higher drought frequency than cmip6 in china we selected ten cmip5 models from the same organizations as the selected cmip6 models to illustrate the difference in precipitation and temperature between the two datasets in terms of average monthly precipitation a more pronounced difference could be observed from may to october as compared with the remaining months tab s1 the average results of ten models and two scenarios indicated a lower annual average precipitation of cmip6 558 3 mm than cmip5 585 8 mm for average monthly temperature the results of cmip5 and cmip6 showed a more obvious gap in may and october tab s2 since the drought represents an anomalous low level of water figs s4 s15 further showed the boxplots of ten models to highlight the distribution characteristics of monthly precipitation and temperature in the uyrb the differences in monthly precipitation and temperature between cmip5 and cmip6 were various for these ten models for example the lower quartile for the precipitation boxplot of bcc csm1 m model was higher than that of bcc csm2 mr model from may to october for temperature similar patterns could be observed in april july and october fig s6 in terms of access1 3 and access esm 1 5 models the opposite in precipitation occurred from april to july fig s5 since the hydrological drought characteristics are highly correlated with simulated runoff computed by meteorological data the inconsistencies of forcing data from cmip5 and cmip6 datasets may cause different results several studies demonstrated that cmip6 was more suitable for drought risk assessment than cmip5 since the improvement of replicating the climatological pattern of the summer monsoon xin et al 2020 xu et al 2021 besides the gcms were demonstrated as the largest shares of the uncertainty in future drought variations yao et al 2020 we used 10 gcms in the current study while gu et al 2020 and omer et al 2020 used 31 and 4 gcms respectively generally more gcms produce more robust predictions but inappropriate models can interfere with the results we selected 10 gcms that could well reproduce historical precipitation and temperature while the others performing relatively poorly were discarded zhang et al 2021a moreover gu et al 2020 used a temperature based method nevertheless we used a more physically based method i e penman monteith equation for potential evapotranspiration calculation the temperature based method can only reflect the influence of temperature on potential evapotranspiration but ignores the impacts of other variables e g radiation wind speed and humidity sheffield et al 2012 revealed that the temperature based method for palmer drought severity index pdsi calculation overestimated the increase in global drought as compared to the penman monteith equation wang et al 2017 found that the potential evapotranspiration estimated by different methods caused obvious distinctions in seasonal changes of future runoff therefore the methods for potential evapotranspiration calculation are also important to explore future hydrological drought variations the rising temperature reduces the proportion of snowfall to the total precipitation and therefore causes the snowpack decreases later snow accumulation and earlier snowmelt jenicek et al 2021 our results suggest that the hydrological drought frequency is expected to rise in spring and summer but decrease in autumn and winter which is impacted by the variations of precipitation and evapotranspiration but is also associated with snowfall changes reservoirs can redistribute runoff which significantly disturbs the hydrological drought process the impacts of the reservoir on hydrological drought are highly related to the operation rules for example a reservoir could effectively mitigate hydrological drought for short term events by replenishing water inversely a reservoir could cause negative impacts for severe or long lasting hydrological drought events due to water storage for power generation during the drought recovery period wu et al 2019 in the uyrb the lyx reservoir stored water in wet years and replenished water in dry years significantly improving the drought tolerance of the basin guo et al 2020 chang et al 2019 designed a hedging policy based on the seasonal drought prevention limiting water level for drought mitigation in the yrb showing better performance than the standard reservoir operation rules overall reservoir regulations are helpful for past hydrological drought mitigation for future hydrological droughts yun et al 2021 suggested that cascade reservoirs operation could also reduce the frequency in the mekong river basin therefore adaptation strategies for reservoirs are crucial for hydrological drought mitigation our results show that future climate change will reduce the severity and duration of hydrological drought events in the uyrb which can lighten the burden of drought mitigation on cascade reservoirs system moreover with the increase of spring drought frequency in r2 and r3 in the future the water supply services of the lyx reservoir will become more important in spring requiring more water to support irrigation and urban water consumption in the downstream area as a result the overall efficiency of power generation may be reduced in future spring on the other hand the reservoirs regions may experience concurrent drought with more severe intensity when drought occurs in the r1 in spring and winter which may request more stored water for drought mitigation overall the projected results of hydrological drought variations in the uyrb suggested that the improved operation rules of cascade reservoirs may be required to reduce the negative influence of climate change since the multi objectives of the cascade reservoirs system it is a complex and challenging work that needs to be further explored in the future the current study still has some limitations the accuracy of the hydrological model was improved because of the consideration of the snow module it still lacks a description of vegetation growth consequently future study needs to use ecohydrological model to explore the variation of hydrological drought under the combined influence of vegetation and climate change the current study only analyzed changes in hydrological drought under the impacts of climate change while the anthropogenic contributions were ignored the influences of human activities on hydrological drought need to be integrated in future studies 6 conclusion the impacts of climate change on hydrological extremes are hot issues especially for the reservoirs area this study attempts to investigate the potential changes of severity duration and frequency of hydrological events and probabilities of concurrent drought in the uyrb during 2021 2100 relative to 1970 2010 under ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios based on the 10 downscaled cmip6 gcm outputs the main findings can be summarized as follows 1 annual temperature and potential evapotranspiration are expected to increase in the uyrb and the changes are similar across the three sub regions while the increase in precipitation becomes progressively smaller from upstream to downstream the runoff is projected to decrease in the near future but increase in the far future 2 the future drought is expected to have a shorter duration and lower severity under the influence of climate change a decrease in future drought frequency is found during autumn and winter future drought events in spring and summer are projected to occur more frequently in the r2 and r3 3 there appears an increase in probabilities of concurrent drought events for different cases in spring during the near future which only can be observed for r2 r3 case during the far future 4 the r1 and r2 may experience more severe concurrent drought events when drought occurs in r3 during the spring and winter in the future our study provides a reference for understanding the impacts of climate change on concurrent hydrological drought variations using the latest cmip6 datasets which is of crucial importance for water resource management in the uyrb the changes in duration and severity of hydrological drought can help policy maker to improve reservoir management a reduction in the duration and severity of hydrological drought events caused by future climate change will lighten the burden of drought mitigation on cascade reservoirs and the stored water can be better supported for power generation and ecological sustainability the changes in concurrent drought probability of different cases can provide insights for further understanding the inner connection of hydrological drought in the uyrb across spatial temporal scales which is thus beneficial for cascade reservoirs system to design

2871,improving the understanding of the future hydrological drought variability in cascade reservoirs area is indispensable for water resource management especially in the context of changing climate this study aims to investigate the hydrological drought variations in the upper yellow river basin uyrb during 2021 2100 employing the latest coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 cmip6 datasets the study area is divided into three sub regions based on the location of the two large reservoirs i e region 1 r1 and region 2 r2 have reservoirs while region 3 r3 has none the meteorological data from 10 cmip6 models are downscaled by utilizing the bias corrected spatial disaggregation bcsd method and then used to force the improved abcd hydrological model for future monthly runoff simulations the changes in severity duration and frequency of drought events in three sub regions under two future climate scenarios ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 relative to the historical period are identified then the copula function is applied to explore the changes in probabilities of spatially concurrent drought for different cases in the future the most likely combination of drought intensity for r1 and r2 corresponding to 10 years conditional return periods is estimated to demonstrate changes in drought risks across the reservoir areas results show that the drought frequency of r2 and r3 is expected to increase in spring and summer and the drought events are projected to have a shorter duration and lower severity overall under two scenarios additionally the spring probabilities of concurrent drought for different cases are expected to increase in the near future increase by 1 9 19 3 but only increase in r2 r3 case in the far future it is noted that although the drought probabilities will decrease in winter r1 and r2 are expected to experience more severe drought when drought occurs in r3 the findings are helpful to improve the understanding of future hydrological drought risk in the uyrb and provide guidelines for making adaptation strategies to climate change keywords climate change cmip6 hydrological drought drought projection spatially concurrent drought data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction global climate change influences the occurrence of extreme events turner et al 2016 drought defined as the anomaly shortage of water is one of the major natural disasters that threaten the stability of ecosystems and the social economy mishra and singh 2010 wu et al 2022 according to statistics on the number of people affected and the economic losses drought has ranked first among all natural disasters leng et al 2015 han et al 2021 explored meteorological drought variations in china from 1961 to 2014 and they found that china s drought events had a higher frequency greater severity and larger affected area after the 1990s than those experienced in the past due to climate change revealing future drought variations under the backdrop of continuously increasing global temperature has become a hot issue which is imperative for the development of adaptation strategies to climate change gu et al 2020 zhang et al 2021a generally drought can be categorized into four types including meteorological agricultural hydrological and socio economic drought according to the deficit of different water cycle variables mishra and singh 2010 among these types hydrological drought mainly manifested as abnormally low runoff can directly threaten public water supplements zhang et al 2022 a previous study indicated that streamflow showed a decreasing trend in arid and semi arid regions of north china during 1956 2005 zhang et al 2011 which enhanced the urgency for understanding the future hydrological drought variabilities the coupled model intercomparison project cmip organized by the world climate research programme wcrp has become the most widely used and influential data source for exploring future climate change and water resources evolution wang et al 2021 based on the cmip5 researchers analyzed future hydrological drought variations in different watersheds for example ahmadalipour et al 2017 used 10 cmip5 gcms to analyze the future changes in hydrological drought characteristics in the willamette river basin u s and indicated that the duration and severity were expected to increase similarly jiao and yuan 2019 concluded that the wudinghe watershed china would experience more severe hydrological drought in the future gu et al 2020 investigated the impacts of future climate change on hydrological drought characteristics in 151 typical catchments over china and showed that both duration and severity would increase in central and southern china but decrease in northeast china and western alpine regions the patterns of future hydrological drought changes were inconsistent across different watersheds recent released cmip6 has been proven that can provide more reasonable future scenarios by integrating the shared socioeconomic pathways ssps and representative concentration pathways rcps qin et al 2021 since the better performance in climate extremes analysis the cmip6 become popular in recent studies for china s meteorological drought projections song et al 2021 su et al 2021a xu et al 2021 however studies of hydrological drought based on cmip6 were still limited recently zeng et al 2022 and wang et al 2021 explored the duration and severity of future hydrological drought events using cmip6 datasets but their studies were focused on a global scale which was insufficient to provide detailed information for water resources management at the watershed scale consequently the hydrological drought variations need to be further explored especially at the subbasin scale which is the spatial scale relevant to water decisions and policy sun et al 2019 due to the complexity of drought researchers emphasized the necessity of drought assessment in terms of multidimensional properties wang et al 2020a zhang et al 2021b to date copula based methods for frequency analysis have been recognized as an effective way to quantify drought risks from a multivariate perspective previous studies usually adopted the copula function to construct the joint distribution of various characteristics of drought events e g the duration severity and affected area and further estimate the return periods feng et al 2021 wang et al 2020b xu et al 2021 however it was still limited in terms of understanding drought events since they only focused on the multivariate drought characteristics in the same region zhao et al 2021 yang et al 2019 emphasized the necessity of a comprehensive understanding of drought events from several hydrological stations visser quinn et al 2019 proposed a framework for the identification of compound hydro hazard hotspots and defined the concept of spatially compound hydro hazard which provided a new perspective for drought analysis the spatially compound drought representing that drought occurs simultaneously in more than one area can pose a greater risk than that only occurs in isolated areas for example the frequent concurrent drought event in water source and destination regions can impact the sustainability of water diversion systems consequently the probability of spatially concurrent drought should be also integrated into the risk assessment framework liu et al 2015 estimated the probability of concurrent drought events between the water source and destination regions of china s south to north water diversion project zhang et al 2017 investigated the characteristics of concurrent hydrological drought events in the poyang lake catchment river system which was helpful to understand the inherent mechanism of hydrological extremes zhao et al 2021 applied the copula based method to reveal the drought encounter risks among three china s major grain production zones these studies have further improved the understanding of multivariate characteristics of drought but studies on how climate change affects probabilities of concurrent hydrological drought in the 21st century are still scarce which is important for drought risk management especially in a cascade reservoirs area the yellow river basin yrb plays a fundamental role in water supply in north western and northern china but it is also one of the most water stressed basins in the world li et al 2020b found that the yrb experienced increasingly serious hydrological drought in the last few decades which caused adverse impacts on economic development besides omer et al 2020 suggested that the water scarcity of the yrb would intensify in the coming decades the upper yrb uyrb producing nearly 57 5 of the water of the entire basin plays important role in industrial agricultural and domestic water supply zhao et al 2009 meanwhile the uyrb is also an important hydropower energy base in china where many large reservoirs have been built the longyangxia and liujiaxia with multi year and annual regulation ability respectively are two pivotal reservoirs in the uyrb these two reservoirs are important to power generation water supply flood control and ecological sustainability across the whole yrb bai et al 2015 however the drought showed an increasing trend during 1961 2015 wang et al 2020a which caused negative impacts on water supply and hydroelectricity due to the importance of the uyrb in the socio economic system clarifying the future variations of hydrological drought is of great interest in light of these issues the objective of the current study is to provide some new insights compared to previous drought assessments in the uyrb differing mainly in the following aspects we adopted the latest cmip6 datasets to evaluate the hydrological drought in the uyrb whereas previous studies were implemented based on cmip5 moreover future hydrological drought evolutions were explored from a perspective of spatially concurrent extreme events in this study whereas past studies primarily focused on independent regions namely we were more focused on the concurrent hydrological drought variations the concurrent drought in the current study represents that hydrological drought can be simultaneously observed at 2 or 3 sub regions divided by reservoirs in the uyrb the motivation of this study is to answer two questions 1 how will climate changes affect the hydrological drought characteristics including duration severity and frequency in the uyrb 2 how will the probabilities of spatially concurrent hydrological drought events be changing in the 21st century the study is designed as follows section 1 introduces the challenges and aims of the study section 2 describes the study area and relevant datasets section 3 presents the framework and methodology of this study the results of the current study are performed in section 4 and the discussions and main conclusions are summarized in section 5 and section 6 respectively 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the yrb is one of the largest basins in china the uyrb controlled by the lanzhou lz hydrological station with an area of 222 551 km2 was selected as our study area fig 1 the annual precipitation and temperature of the uyrb were nearly 446 mm and 0 89 c respectively many reservoirs have been built to guarantee enough power generation irrigation consumption and domestic water for the downstream area thus the frequent hydrological drought in the uyrb can directly impact the water supply of the total yrb the liujiaxia ljx and longyangxia lyx reservoirs with effective storage capacities of 193 6 108 m3 and 35 108 m3 respectively are the large control water projects in the study area su et al 2021b here the study area was divided into three sub regions region 1 r1 represents the area above the lyx reservoir and region 2 r2 donates the area between the ljx reservoir and the lyx reservoir while region 3 r3 is the area between the ljx reservoir and lz station according to the location of reservoirs the runoff of r1 and r2 can be regulated by the lyx and ljx respectively while that of r3 cannot be regulated by a large reservoir the subsequent analysis of concurrent drought events was based on these three sub regions 2 2 data the datasets adopted in this study include meteorological data and streamflow data we collected historic meteorological data from the 0 25 0 25 grided dataset named cn05 1 during a period from 1970 to 2010 the cn05 1 dataset https ccrc iap ac cn resource detail id 228 produced by wu and gao 2013 based on the recorded data of 2400 meteorological stations in china provides meteorological data such as precipitation temperature relative humidity wind speed etc the accuracy of cn05 1 dataset had been validated in previous study wu and gao 2013 then the natural streamflow data of tangnaihai tnh xiaochuan xc and lz stations fig 1 from 1970 to 1990 was obtained from the yellow river conservancy commission here the natural streamflow is the observed streamflow plus the anthropic water use which excludes the influences of direct human activities for future meteorological data it was collected from coupled model inter comparison project phase 6 cmip6 gcms outputs from the world climate research project https esgf node llnl gov projects cmip6 in the current study 10 cmip6 models listed in table 1 were selected because of their good performance in china zhang et al 2021a also two ssp scenarios i e ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 representing the scenarios with 1 5 c and 2 0 c increase in the future were considered for each model moreover the cmip5 datasets under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios were obtained from the world climate research project https esgf node llnl gov projects cmip5 3 methods as mentioned in the section of the introduction we are interested in the future changes in hydrological drought characteristics based on cmip6 fig 2 displays a flowchart of this study and the subsections below present a detailed introduction of the methods 3 1 downscaling of cmip6 dataset when focusing on watershed scale results the post processing i e bias correction and downscaling of cmip6 data is necessary because of its error and rough spatial resolution the bias corrected spatial disaggregation bcsd method wood et al 2002 widely applicated in gcms outputs downscaling was adopted to downscale the cmip6 dataset in the current study the method contains two step including bias correction and spatial downscaling firstly the inverse distance weighted idw method was used to make the cn05 1 dataset have a low resolution with the gcm dataset then the gcm dataset was corrected to match with the cumulative distribution function cdf of the cn05 1 dataset the bias corrected gcm datasets were then disaggregated to high spatial resolution as same as the cn05 1 dataset i e 0 25 by this the correction factors could be estimated by the observation and high resolution gcm dataset moreover the statical indicators of nash sutcliffe efficiency nse the correlation coefficient r and the mean absolute error mae were used to evaluate the accuracy of downscaled results 3 2 hydrological simulation to understand the future hydrological drought variations it is necessary to apply downscaled cmip6 data to force hydrological model for streamflow simulation the abcd model developed by thomas 1981 is very popular in streamflow simulation since of its high accuracy and simple structures wang et al 2017 indicated that the abcd model performed well in the uyrb and used the model to evaluate future streamflow variations to improve the accuracy of runoff simulation we also utilized the abcd model but integrated a simple snow melt module to make it i e improved abcd model more realistic in revealing the hydrological processes in our study area the snow melt module was referred to the approach of chen et al 2017 but it was carried out on a monthly scale the improved abcd model takes monthly precipitation potential evapotranspiration and air temperature as input and has six parameters that need to be calibrated a detailed information can be found in fig s1 the potential evapotranspiration was computed by using the penman monteith equation monteith and unsworth 1990 here we used the shuffled complex evolution algorithm duan et al 1994 to obtain the best model parameters and then applied three classic indicators including the nse the coefficient of determination r2 and the percent bias pbias to evaluate the model accuracy guo et al 2021 the parameters were calibrated based on a station by station method to reflect their spatial heterogeneity then the runoff of three sub regions was obtained based on the interval runoff and the proportion of the area controlled by reservoirs and hydrological stations 3 3 drought evaluation the standardized runoff index sri developed by shukla and wood 2008 is popular in hydrological drought assessment because of its simple calculations and flexibility at different timescales the index is computed by fitting a cumulative probability density function based on more than 30 years of runoff records previous studies indicated that the log normal distribution showed good performance in fitting streamflow series wu et al 2018 zhang et al 2021b accordingly the log normal distribution was determined to calculate sri series in this study the fitting performance of the log normal distribution function in three sub regions was checked using the kolmogorov smirnov test shown in fig s2 the theoretical and empirical cumulative distribution frequency showed high consistency and the results also passed the kolmogorov smirnov test p 0 01 we computed the sri at 3 month scale sri3 and 12 month scale sri12 to evaluate the intensity of seasonal and annual drought conditions the run theory yevjevich 1967 was utilized to obtain the severity and duration of drought events the study period was divided into three subperiods i e 1971 2010 2021 2060 and 2061 2100 that represented historical near future and far future periods respectively of note was that the future sri series was estimated based on the historical distribution parameters to highlight the impact of climate change on hydrological drought in detail the future sri series were calculated by future 2021 2100 runoff and the distribution parameters estimated by historical 1970 2010 data here the threshold of the drought was determined by 0 5 namely a drought event started once the sri value was less than 0 5 3 4 joint probability of concurrent drought the calculations of the joint probability of concurrent drought include two steps 1 selecting the marginal distribution and parameters for each sri series 2 determining the optimal copula function and estimating the joint probability distribution of encounter drought events in the current study four widely used distributions for drought analysis including normal nor generalized extreme value gev logistic log and extreme value ev were adopted as the candidate marginal functions and the optimal one was determined by kolmogorov smirnov test the copula function can flexibly establish the joint probability distribution of multi dimensional variables nelsen 1998 wu et al 2021 which here was used to compute the probability of concurrent drought among the uyrb the joint distribution can be summarized as 1 f x 1 x 2 x n c f 1 x 1 f 2 x 2 f n x n where f x 1 x 2 x n and f i x i i 1 n represent the joint cumulative distribution function and marginal univariate cumulative distribution function respectively the c donates the copula function for simplicity and representativeness three archimedean copulas gumbel frank and clayton were used as the candidate functions since their wide applications chang et al 2016 and the optimal one was obtained by the akaike information criteria aic value akaike 1973 since the study area was divided into three sub regions there were four cases of concurrent drought events i e a drought occurred simultaneously in pairwise two regions case 1 to 3 or all three regions case 4 for the case 1 to 3 the joint probability f x y of concurrent drought can be estimated as 2 f x y p x x y y c f x x f y y where p and c represent the probability density function and the copula function respectively x and y are the sri of two sub regions while f x x f y y are the marginal distribution of sri series correspondingly for the concurrent drought probability of three regions it can be computed by following the eq 3 3 f x y z p x x y y z z c f x x f y y f z z where f z z represent the marginal distribution of sri for the third sub region besides since the runoff of r1 and r2 can be regulated by reservoirs we also consider the case case 5 that r1 and r2 simultaneously experience drought under the premise that drought occurs in r3 the probabilities can be estimated as follow 4 p x x y y z z f x y z f z the return period can be calculated by the following formula 5 t x x y y z z u p x x y y z z where u is the average inter arrival time of the drought occurrences moreover to provide useful guidelines for reservoirs operation we computed the most likely scenario for case 5 under a specific return period based on the highest condition joint density which could be estimated as follow 6 x y z z arg m a x f x y z f z z c f x x f y y f z z f x x f y y where f x y z is the joint probability density function of sri series for three sub regions c f x x f y y f z z donates the density function of the copula and f x x f y y and f z z represent probability density functions of sri series of r1 r2 and r3 respectively 4 result 4 1 changes of future hydro meteorological variables we first validated the accuracy of downscaled meteorological data and hydrological modeling and the results were presented in fig s3 and fig s4 respectively the bcsd method has a good performance in our study area that the nse and r of these downscaled variables from different gcms are all more than 0 8 and 0 9 respectively according to the evaluation criteria recommended by moriasi et al 2007 the improved abcd model has a very good performance in the study area since the nse and r2 are more than 0 8 and the pbias is less than 5 during the calibration and validation period moreover the improved model shows higher nse and r than the original model and the variations between recorded data and runoff simulated by the improved model are more closely compared to that simulated by the original model especially during the non flood period indicating that the improved model can provide more reliable results for future hydrological drought evaluation changes in future projected annual precipitation potential evapotranspiration and temperature variables over three regions are shown in fig 3 generally these three variables all show an increasing trend under two scenarios and the magnitudes under ssp5 8 5 are more significant than those under ssp2 4 5 especially in the far future according to the average results changes in precipitation potential evapotranspiration and temperature in three regions are all expected to increase by a range of 40 99 mm 197 438 mm and 1 5 4 47 c respectively and the changes in precipitation of r1 are more visible than other regions also the future runoff is simulated based on the downscaled meteorological data and hydrological model and the changes are exhibited in fig 3 d it is noted that the runoff changes have high uncertainty that both richer and poorer runoff can be observed due to the forcing data from different gcms from the average results of different gcms the runoff will change with a range between 0 2 mm and 3 6 mm in the near future while rich runoff would be observed in the far future with a range of 0 4 16 1 mm and the magnitudes of future runoff changes in r1 are more noticeable than those in r2 and r3 which show a similar pattern with precipitation 4 2 characteristics of future hydrological drought the severity and duration of drought events under two scenarios in three sub regions were estimated shown in fig 4 the mean drought severity of three sub regions is expected to decrease from a range of 5 9 8 0 to a range of 3 3 6 1 while the mean drought duration is projected to be shortened from 5 8 to 6 6 months to 3 8 5 3 months in r1 and r3 the drought duration of r2 shows a very slight increase only during the near future under ssp5 8 5 thus we infer that the future droughts in the uyrb will alleviate under ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 when compared with historical drought events understandings of drought frequency changes between historical and future periods are also valuable for policy makers here we estimated the frequency of drought occurrence on the annual and seasonal scales for different periods under two scenarios shown in fig 5 the values of sri12 in december were used to reflect the annual drought conditions and values of sri3 in may august november and february were utilized to reflect the drought conditions of spring summer autumn and winter respectively generally future droughts are more likely to occur in spring and the frequency of drought in the far future is generally lower than that in the near future besides the frequency of drought in three sub regions is also projected to decrease in autumn and winter for the annual drought events we found a lower frequency in r1 and r2 and a higher frequency in r3 in the future compared to the historical period meanwhile the frequency of drought for spring and summer will increase in r2 and r3 while it is projected to be lower in r1 for example the mean frequency of drought for spring during the historical period was 45 27 5 and 27 5 in the r1 r2 and r3 respectively while it was estimated at 38 5 and 29 5 in the r1 48 5 and 36 3 in the r2 and 48 and 35 in the r3 during the 2021 2060 and 2061 2100 respectively under ssp2 4 5 it is worth noting that changes in drought frequency under different scenarios are not always consistent for example the frequency of spring drought in the r2 at the near future shows increasing and decreasing trends under ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 respectively moreover the frequency obtained from different gcms exhibits a large discrepancy 4 3 risks of future concurrent hydrological drought 4 3 1 probability of historical concurrent drought event the kolmogorov smirnov test was applied to determine the optimal marginal for the sri series and the results were shown in table 2 the statistics of the dmax for four distributions are lower than the critical values indicating that these distributions all show good performance among these the dmax values of gev and log distribution are generally smaller compared with nor and ev distribution then the copula functions were applied to establish the probabilistic relationship for four concurrent drought cases including that drought occurs simultaneously in r1 and r2 r1 r2 r1 and r3 r1 r3 r2 and r3 r2 r3 and r1 r2 and r3 r1 r2 r3 and the aic values of different copulas were listed in table 3 the most suitable copula function for each case was determined by the smallest aic values for example the frank copula has better performance for the case of r1 r2 in annual spring summer and winter while the clayton copula is optimal in autumn based on the joint distribution we estimated the historical probabilities of concurrent drought for four cases shown in table 4 the probabilities of concurrent drought events in three regions are generally lower than the probabilities of any combination of two regions at the annual scale the concurrent drought of cases r1 r2 r1 r3 r2 r3 and r1 r2 r3 occurred 9 7 6 and 5 times respectively while the estimated probabilities were 18 7 12 7 13 3 and 7 7 respectively for seasonal concurrent drought events the highest joint probabilities for r1 r3 can be observed in spring at 20 7 while the highest joint probabilities for other cases are all in autumn ranging between 12 5 and 18 1 overall the copula based results were highly consistent with the records thus the future probabilities of concurrent drought events were also estimated by the same calculation procedure 4 3 2 changes of future probability of concurrent drought events here we exhibited the changes of probabilities for concurrent drought events in the future under two scenarios in table 5 based on the ensemble results it was found that the probabilities for different cases will decrease with change rates ranging between 4 5 and 13 5 in autumn and winter during two future periods while different change patterns could be observed in other seasons for example the ensemble median for probabilities of r2 r3 and r1 r2 r3 cases during 2021 2060 become higher in spring and summer and similar changes can be only found in spring for r1 r2 and r1 r3 cases during 2061 2100 the probabilities of annual spring and summer for r1 r2 and r1 r3 cases show a decrease while it is expected to increase for r2 r3 case in summer overall compared with ssp2 4 5 the probabilities of concurrent drought events for different cases show a greater increase under ssp5 8 5 during the near future while the results of r2 r3 case are the opposite in the far future since the uncertainty of gcms output the changes in runoff based on different sources are not consistent as shown in table 5 discernable differences can be expected for climatic impacts on probabilities changes based on different gcms for example increased probabilities for four cases based on the access esm 1 5 cesm2 gfdl esm4 and mpi esm1 2lr are evident but the results based on ec earth3 miroc6 mri esm2 0 demonstrate a decrease in spring during 2021 2060 since the runoff of r3 cannot be regulated by a large reservoir an interesting question is what the drought intensity in reservoir regions are i e r1 and r2 when r3 experiences drought therefore the risks of concurrent hydrological drought among r2 and r3 under the condition of the drought occurring in the r1 i e case 5 were analyzed based on eq 4 and eq 5 fig 6 illustrates the concurrent drought intensity with a 10 years return period in r1 and r2 during historical near future and far future periods under different scenarios based on different gcms when drought occurs in r3 it was found that the historical contour lines were always located to the lower left of anyone in future autumn representing that future concurrent drought would be mitigated due to climate change besides since the uncertainties of gcms the relationships between the future contour lines and historical one are different specifically compared with the historical one most of future contour lines in annual and summer move to the upper right location and most of the isolines in spring move to the lower left location note that the significant left downward displacement of the future winter contour lines relative to the historical one implying a more severe concurrent drought event in r1 and r2 when drought occurs in r3 under the impacts of climate change we further explore the intensity of most likely drought encounters with a 10 years return period across r1 and r2 when drought occurs in r3 by using eq 6 fig 7 presents the changes in future sri δsri values of r1 and r2 relative to the historical period based on different gcms the relationship between the δsri values of r1 and r2 can be summarized as four types i e both the two values are greater than zero type 1 or less than zero type 2 and the value of r1 type 3 or r2 type 4 is greater than zero while the other is less than zero it is found that most of the results based on different gcms belong to type 1 and type 2 for example during the near future the change patterns of annual summer and autumn are type 1 but those of spring and winter are type 2 under both ssp2 4 5 and spp5 8 5 scenarios for the period of far future most of the change patterns are type 1 representing a lower drought risk besides the ensemble results of summer under ssp5 8 5 and winter under ssp2 4 5 are type 3 suggesting a higher drought risk in the r2 5 discussion since the cmip6 data can reasonably project future climate characteristics of northwest china li et al 2020a the current study explored the future hydrological drought variations in the uyrb using the latest projection climate data from cmip6 interestingly compared with findings based on cmip5 gu et al 2020 omer et al 2020 the current study found that future hydrological drought in the uyrb would be mitigated with a shorter duration and lower severity here we discussed the potential causes for this difference including 1 the version of cmip 2 the selection of gcms model and 3 the calculation methods of potential evapotranspiration a case study from turkey showed that the overall dryness feature of cmip6 became less pronounced in comparison to cmip5 bağçaci et al 2021 chen and yuan 2021 summarized that a larger increase in evapotranspiration projected by cmip5 lead to a higher drought frequency than cmip6 in china we selected ten cmip5 models from the same organizations as the selected cmip6 models to illustrate the difference in precipitation and temperature between the two datasets in terms of average monthly precipitation a more pronounced difference could be observed from may to october as compared with the remaining months tab s1 the average results of ten models and two scenarios indicated a lower annual average precipitation of cmip6 558 3 mm than cmip5 585 8 mm for average monthly temperature the results of cmip5 and cmip6 showed a more obvious gap in may and october tab s2 since the drought represents an anomalous low level of water figs s4 s15 further showed the boxplots of ten models to highlight the distribution characteristics of monthly precipitation and temperature in the uyrb the differences in monthly precipitation and temperature between cmip5 and cmip6 were various for these ten models for example the lower quartile for the precipitation boxplot of bcc csm1 m model was higher than that of bcc csm2 mr model from may to october for temperature similar patterns could be observed in april july and october fig s6 in terms of access1 3 and access esm 1 5 models the opposite in precipitation occurred from april to july fig s5 since the hydrological drought characteristics are highly correlated with simulated runoff computed by meteorological data the inconsistencies of forcing data from cmip5 and cmip6 datasets may cause different results several studies demonstrated that cmip6 was more suitable for drought risk assessment than cmip5 since the improvement of replicating the climatological pattern of the summer monsoon xin et al 2020 xu et al 2021 besides the gcms were demonstrated as the largest shares of the uncertainty in future drought variations yao et al 2020 we used 10 gcms in the current study while gu et al 2020 and omer et al 2020 used 31 and 4 gcms respectively generally more gcms produce more robust predictions but inappropriate models can interfere with the results we selected 10 gcms that could well reproduce historical precipitation and temperature while the others performing relatively poorly were discarded zhang et al 2021a moreover gu et al 2020 used a temperature based method nevertheless we used a more physically based method i e penman monteith equation for potential evapotranspiration calculation the temperature based method can only reflect the influence of temperature on potential evapotranspiration but ignores the impacts of other variables e g radiation wind speed and humidity sheffield et al 2012 revealed that the temperature based method for palmer drought severity index pdsi calculation overestimated the increase in global drought as compared to the penman monteith equation wang et al 2017 found that the potential evapotranspiration estimated by different methods caused obvious distinctions in seasonal changes of future runoff therefore the methods for potential evapotranspiration calculation are also important to explore future hydrological drought variations the rising temperature reduces the proportion of snowfall to the total precipitation and therefore causes the snowpack decreases later snow accumulation and earlier snowmelt jenicek et al 2021 our results suggest that the hydrological drought frequency is expected to rise in spring and summer but decrease in autumn and winter which is impacted by the variations of precipitation and evapotranspiration but is also associated with snowfall changes reservoirs can redistribute runoff which significantly disturbs the hydrological drought process the impacts of the reservoir on hydrological drought are highly related to the operation rules for example a reservoir could effectively mitigate hydrological drought for short term events by replenishing water inversely a reservoir could cause negative impacts for severe or long lasting hydrological drought events due to water storage for power generation during the drought recovery period wu et al 2019 in the uyrb the lyx reservoir stored water in wet years and replenished water in dry years significantly improving the drought tolerance of the basin guo et al 2020 chang et al 2019 designed a hedging policy based on the seasonal drought prevention limiting water level for drought mitigation in the yrb showing better performance than the standard reservoir operation rules overall reservoir regulations are helpful for past hydrological drought mitigation for future hydrological droughts yun et al 2021 suggested that cascade reservoirs operation could also reduce the frequency in the mekong river basin therefore adaptation strategies for reservoirs are crucial for hydrological drought mitigation our results show that future climate change will reduce the severity and duration of hydrological drought events in the uyrb which can lighten the burden of drought mitigation on cascade reservoirs system moreover with the increase of spring drought frequency in r2 and r3 in the future the water supply services of the lyx reservoir will become more important in spring requiring more water to support irrigation and urban water consumption in the downstream area as a result the overall efficiency of power generation may be reduced in future spring on the other hand the reservoirs regions may experience concurrent drought with more severe intensity when drought occurs in the r1 in spring and winter which may request more stored water for drought mitigation overall the projected results of hydrological drought variations in the uyrb suggested that the improved operation rules of cascade reservoirs may be required to reduce the negative influence of climate change since the multi objectives of the cascade reservoirs system it is a complex and challenging work that needs to be further explored in the future the current study still has some limitations the accuracy of the hydrological model was improved because of the consideration of the snow module it still lacks a description of vegetation growth consequently future study needs to use ecohydrological model to explore the variation of hydrological drought under the combined influence of vegetation and climate change the current study only analyzed changes in hydrological drought under the impacts of climate change while the anthropogenic contributions were ignored the influences of human activities on hydrological drought need to be integrated in future studies 6 conclusion the impacts of climate change on hydrological extremes are hot issues especially for the reservoirs area this study attempts to investigate the potential changes of severity duration and frequency of hydrological events and probabilities of concurrent drought in the uyrb during 2021 2100 relative to 1970 2010 under ssp2 4 5 and ssp5 8 5 scenarios based on the 10 downscaled cmip6 gcm outputs the main findings can be summarized as follows 1 annual temperature and potential evapotranspiration are expected to increase in the uyrb and the changes are similar across the three sub regions while the increase in precipitation becomes progressively smaller from upstream to downstream the runoff is projected to decrease in the near future but increase in the far future 2 the future drought is expected to have a shorter duration and lower severity under the influence of climate change a decrease in future drought frequency is found during autumn and winter future drought events in spring and summer are projected to occur more frequently in the r2 and r3 3 there appears an increase in probabilities of concurrent drought events for different cases in spring during the near future which only can be observed for r2 r3 case during the far future 4 the r1 and r2 may experience more severe concurrent drought events when drought occurs in r3 during the spring and winter in the future our study provides a reference for understanding the impacts of climate change on concurrent hydrological drought variations using the latest cmip6 datasets which is of crucial importance for water resource management in the uyrb the changes in duration and severity of hydrological drought can help policy maker to improve reservoir management a reduction in the duration and severity of hydrological drought events caused by future climate change will lighten the burden of drought mitigation on cascade reservoirs and the stored water can be better supported for power generation and ecological sustainability the changes in concurrent drought probability of different cases can provide insights for further understanding the inner connection of hydrological drought in the uyrb across spatial temporal scales which is thus beneficial for cascade reservoirs system to design

2872,the projected increase in the frequency of extreme rainfall events with climate change has serious implications for flood risk management this study developed a novel method to evaluate future flood inundation risk in the kakehashi river basin japan first a pseudo global warming pgw method and ensemble simulation techniques were combined to develop rainfall projections with different return periods based on the weather research and forecasting wrf model second runoff analyses were performed for the target river basin and inundation simulations including levee breaches were conducted at high spatial resolution 40 40 m finally the potential inundation risk for the river basin was estimated rainfall simulation results indicated intensification of short duration heavy rainfall events the pgw ensemble simulations indicated that extreme rainfall scenarios with long return periods 1000 years based on current conditions are likely to occur more frequently in the future highlighting the possibility of flood intensification regardless of the length of return period areas with infrequent flooding but large inundation depth and those with more frequent flooding but small inundation depth were classified as high risk the proposed method provides a baseline framework for future flood risk assessments and the results highlight the importance of incorporating currently rare heavy rainfall events in future flood management evaluation and planning keywords flood risk assessment inundation pseudo global warming climate change ensemble simulation data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction the frequency and magnitude of precipitation extremes are projected to increase because of climate change ipcc 2012 2014 assessments of future flood risk as a result of extreme rainfall events are vital given the enormous impacts of such events on people communities and ecosystems aerts 2009 estimated the adaptation costs of flood protection under various climate change scenarios for the netherlands which ranged from 9 to 80 billion euros depending on the climate scenario used in future flood risk assessments the uncertainties inherent in future climate projections should be considered future climatic conditions have been projected using various global climate models gcms for multiple greenhouse gas emissions scenarios taylor et al 2012 kundzewicz et al 2014 reviewed the projected variation in rainfall and floods for various regions of the world reported in the special report on managing the risks of extreme events and disasters to advance climate change adaptation srex report they found that there was low confidence in projections of fluvial floods likely attributable to uncertainty regarding future climate projections using 21 gcm projections arnell and gosling 2016 investigated future river flood risk at the global scale and found wide variations in the projections similarly collet et al 2017 examined future extreme river runoff projections for great britain and concluded that the uncertainty in extreme climate change projections must be considered in future risk assessments lopez cantu et al 2020 investigated future variations of extreme rainfalls in u s using multiple gcm output and multiple global warming scenarios 227 projections to take into account for uncertainties garrote et al 2021 developed probabilistic flood maps for the city of zamoa spain and showed that flood risk may be underestimated without consideration of uncertainties in flood frequency probabilistic evaluations can be used to account for variations in climate projections and the resulting uncertainty regarding future risks in this context ensemble simulations are useful for incorporating the chaotic behavior of meteorological phenomena and uncertainties in forcing data new et al 2007 used ensemble rainfall runoff simulations to generate probabilistic risk assessments using the results of gcm simulations for various greenhouse gas emission scenarios ward et al 2014 implemented hydrological simulations for the rhine river based on a 3000 year time series of climatic conditions and developed a probability distribution of future flood risk based on daily and extreme discharges xu et al 2017 estimated future variations in flood exceedance probability based on hydrological simulations driven by future rainfall projections alfieri et al 2015 used ensemble climate projections to assess the intensity and frequency of extreme flood events for europe and found that on average the frequency of floods with return periods of 100 years or more doubled within 30 years in probabilistic risk evaluation research stochastic methods are applied to generates a large number of samples and flood risk is evaluated oubennaceur et al 2019 stochastically generated 1000 discharge samples and estimated flood damage for each sample and calculated the average flood loss for the richelieu river in canada kheradmand et al 2018 applied a probabilistic framework to estimate flood risk for the city of niamey niger the peak discharge values for the niger river were calculated 1000 times by using statistical methods and flood damage was estimated for multiple return periods garrote et al 2021 applied the monte carlo method to consider the uncertainty of extreme floods in zamora city spain 500 peak flow were generated by a statistical method and flood hazard for each return period were estimated in many studies risk assessment is performed for each target return period and there are few cases in which comprehensive evaluations are made based on the risks of multiple return period oliver et al 2018 generated 1000 year flood flow data and calculated damage and loss for each return period for the upper koshi river in nepal then by considering the annual frequency of occurrence of the flood event and the mean loss value of flood for each return period the average annual loss aal was calculated the aal is a kind of comprehensive risk index based on floods with multiple return period in oliver et al 2019 the aal was estimated by 5000 year flood flow for four river basins in uttarakhand india traditionally flood management planning is based on return periods estimated from past observations however under future climatic conditions rainfall patterns will differ from those of the present climate using 17 models in coupled model intercomparison project 5 cmip5 guo et al 2016 showed that precipitation extremes in china will become more frequent and more intense with climate change li et al 2018 investigated future variation in the magnitude and probability of extreme precipitation in china with 1 5 and 2 0 c increases in the global average temperature they found that the frequency of previously rare events extreme precipitation was projected to increase with a 2 0 c temperature rise consideration of the nonstationarity of future precipitation is essential for flood risk evaluation and management šraj et al 2016 estimated flood quantiles using stationary and nonstationary models and found that stationary models underestimated flood events in recent years highlighting the necessity of considering nonstationarity slater et al 2021 argued that nonstationarity increase the uncertainty and pointed out that the large uncertainty can be problematic to flood prevention various studies have been conducted on the impact of nonstationarity on uncertainty and flood risk assessment obeysekera and salas 2014 hu et al 2022 naseri and hummel 2022 cheng and aghakouchak 2014 also showed that under changing climatic conditions the assumption of precipitation stationarity is no longer correct return periods traditionally used for extreme events are no longer applicable in the context of climate change and previous studies have reported increase in the frequency of extreme events such as 100 year floods gilroy and mccuen 2012 rojas et al 2012 super typhoons lin et al 2016 and extreme rainfall events ranger et al 2011 le et al 2021 the nonstationarity of future climate conditions can be considered using a coupled method incorporating a pseudo global warming pgw downscaling technique and ensemble simulations high resolution data regarding future high impact weather events are indispensable for impact assessment in river basins dynamic downscaling results of gcms are strongly influenced by their bias kato et al 2001 in the pgw method future climatic conditions are generated by coupling reanalysis data and future climatic anomalies downscaling results of pgw conditions are expected to reflect the impact of global warming on the actual present climate then future dynamic downscaling results derived by pgw forcing can be compared directly with present downscaling results of reanalysis data some previous studies have used pgw and dynamic downscaling to evaluate a range of high impact weather events e g hill and lackmann 2011 lackmann 2015 marciano et al 2015 taniguchi and sho 2015 dynamic downscaling can be used to obtain detailed characteristics of high impact weather events but numerous samples from model simulations are necessary to investigate the patterns of extreme weather events under future climate scenarios taniguchi 2018 developed a simple ensemble simulation technique to produce numerous samples using a numerical weather prediction model when applied to a past typhoon event by coupling with the pgw technique the stochastic characteristics of future extreme rainfall were illustrated based on multiple ensemble members however simply showing various possibilities is insufficient for development of specific flood disaster prevention plans this study developed a novel technique for calculating potential inundation risk rp first an ensemble pgw technique was used to produce high resolution future heavy rainfall event projections with various return periods based on past rainfall events in the kakehashi river basin japan second runoff analyses and inundation simulations were implemented for the kakehashi river basin to obtain various inundation depths then the outputs of the inundation simulations and rainfall projections were combined to calculate rp 2 methods 2 1 overview of the kakehashi river basin the kakehashi river is a class 1 river that flows through ishikawa prefecture in japan the river starts at mt suzugadake in the dainichizan mountain range of mt hakusan flows north on the mountain and joins several branches goutani river kasukami river fuddaiji river before entering the plains fig 1 subsequently the nabetani hatcho and mae rivers join the kakehashi river before it reaches the sea of japan the main path of the river is 42 km long and the basin area is 271 2 km2 most of which accommodates the city of komatsu the second largest city in ishikawa prefecture to date the highest recorded water level of the river was during a heavy rainfall event in july 2013 2 2 data data from the national centers for environmental prediction final ncep fnl operational global analysis were used national centers for environmental prediction national weather service noaa u s department of commerce 2000 for the initial and boundary conditions of the hindcast simulations and the base state conditions for the pgw simulations ncep fnl data have been generated by the global data assimilation system gdas at ncep from 1999 to the near present the spatial and temporal resolutions of the ncep fnl data are 1 1 and 6 h respectively ncep fnl data are available for the surface 31 pressure levels from 1000 to 1 hpa and other specific layers e g tropopause cloud bottom level cloud top level and several other levels surface pressure sea level pressure geopotential height air temperature sea surface temperature sst soil temperature soil moisture relative humidity u and v component winds and vertical motion were included as initial and boundary conditions for the lower boundary conditions of the numerical weather simulations ssts from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa optimum interpolation 1 4 daily sst noaa oi sst analysis data reynolds et al 2007 were used different types of observational data from satellites ships and buoys are combined to generate noaa oi ssts in terms of satellite data ssts from the advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr and advanced microwave scanning radiometer for the earth observing system amsr e were used the spatial resolution of the noaa oi sst dataset is 0 25 0 25 the initial and boundary conditions for the pgw simulations were generated from the ncep fnl data and future climate projections from five different gcms developed for cmip5 taylor et al 2012 in cmip5 multiple atmospheric greenhouse gas concentration scenarios i e representative concentration pathways rcps are applied in this study future projections based on the rcp8 5 scenario radiative forcing of the earth in 2100 of 8 5 w m2 greater than the preindustrial level were used to develop the pgw conditions the five gcms used in this study are listed in table 1 details of the pgw method are described in section 2 3 rainfall in the hindcast simulations was compared with radar amedas precipitation rap data which combine weather radar observations and surface precipitation observations from the automated meteorological data acquisition system amedas of the japan meteorological agency these data have high spatial resolution 5 km until march 2001 2 5 km from march 2001 and 1 km from 2006 and temporal resolution of 1 h rap data were considered appropriate for verifying the hindcast simulations makihara et al 1996 2 3 models and simulation settings 2 3 1 rainfall simulations possible extreme rainfall events were simulated using a numerical weather simulation model combined with the pgw method the weather research and forecasting wrf model skamarock et al 2008 version 3 7 1 was used applying a two way three level nesting approach fig 2 the spatial resolutions for the parent intermediate and child domains were 30 10 and 3 333 km respectively the lin ice scheme lin et al 1983 and betts miller janjic scheme janjic 1994 2000 were used for microphysics and cumulus parameterizations respectively the physical processes of the surface layer and the land surface were calculated using the eta model based on the monin obukhov length with the zilitinkevich thermal roughness length skamarock et al 2008 and the noah land surface model chen and dudhia 2001 respectively planetary boundary layer processes were calculated using the mellor yamada nakanishi and niino level 3 scheme nakanishi and niino 2009 a simple rapid radiative transfer model was used for longwave and shortwave radiation iacono et al 2008 a spectral nudging method was applied for atmospheric temperature zonal wind meridional wind and geopotential height every 6 h above the height of 6 7 km for the parent domain an outline of these settings is presented in table 2 based on sato et al 2007 pgw conditions were generated by combining ncep fnl data with future climatological anomalies derived from five gcm projections future 10 year monthly means were calculated for the period 2091 2100 using the rcp8 5 emissions scenario for each gcm present conditions were calculated as 10 year monthly means from 1991 to 2000 using the historical runs future climatological anomalies were calculated as the difference in the 10 year monthly mean conditions for the future and present twenty year mean climate conditions are often used in climatological studies however 10 year mean conditions were used here to evaluate the effects of advanced global warming conditions at the end of the 21st century these anomalies were added to the 6 h atmospheric conditions from the ncep fnl data then pgw conditions were obtained for wind atmospheric temperature geopotential height and surface pressure for relative humidity the original ncep fnl values were preserved and specific humidity under pgw was calculated from the relative humidity and modified atmospheric temperature of the future climate the ssts for the pgw conditions were generated by adding future sst anomalies obtained from each gcm to the noaa oi ssts the pgw experiments were termed pgw 1 pgw 2 pgw 3 and so on based on the number of the gcm used table 1 an ensemble simulation technique was adopted to obtain multiple simulation results for probabilistic evaluation of heavy rainfall events the lagged simulated perturbation lsp method taniguchi 2018 was used for ensemble simulations the lsp method can be applied to any type of high impact weather event and simulations can be started at an arbitrary time and date the lsp method consists of three steps first three simulations were implemented with different initial times to obtain three base state vectors s 1 s 2 and s 3 at a set interruption time second difference vectors δ s 2 and δ s 3 were defined as the differences between s 2 and s 1 and between s 3 and s 1 respectively third new state vectors s n were generated from three vectors s 1 δ s 2 and δ s 3 as follows 1 s n s 1 α δ s 2 β δ s 3 where α and β are scale factors for δ s 2 and δ s 3 respectively then the simulations were restarted from the interruption time with the new state vector s n in s n atmospheric temperature zonal and meridional wind components specific humidity atmospheric pressure and sst were updated nineteen ensemble members were generated for the hindcast and five pgw simulations using the scale factors shown in table 3 the initial and interruption times of the simulations are shown in table 4 2 3 2 rainfall runoff inundation rri model a rainfall runoff inundation rri model sayama et al 2012 was used to estimate river discharge in the kakehashi river basin the rri model is a fully coupled rainfall runoff and hydraulic inundation model slopes and rivers were assumed within the same grid cell and the river channel was considered to be a single line on the overlying slope cells a two dimensional 2d diffusive wave model was applied to estimate flow over the slope and a one dimensional 1d diffusive model was adopted for the main channel flow elevation flow direction and flow accumulation for the kakehashi river basin were generated from hydrological maps based on shuttle elevation derivatives at multiple scales hydrosheds fifteen arcsecond resolution approximately 500 m data products were used in this study the modeled basin and flow accumulation are shown in fig 3 a in the rri model several infiltration and ground water options were applied because of the wet summer conditions in japan excess overland flow with the assumption of a saturated subsurface was applied to validate the settings the rri model was applied to five flood events in the kakehashi river basin fig s1 supplementary information presents hydrographs and hyetographs for the five flood events in all cases the initial flush was reproduced well but there were some differences in the peak discharge amounts the nash sutcliffe coefficients are 0 90 0 65 0 73 0 74 and 0 42 for the five events average 0 69 some results showed low accuracy but generally the rri settings were considered suitable 2 3 3 seamless model a seamlessly integrated inundation simulation model hereafter the seamless model was developed to incorporate the various factors that influence inundation in urbanized areas sanuki et al 2016 the seamless model consists of a 1d river model 2d surface flow model and a sewage network model fig 3b shows the area of the inundation simulation the 1d river model covers a 12 4 km section from the mouth of the kakehashi river the continuity equation and the equation of motion can be expressed as follows 2 b η t q x q 3 q t uq x g a η x g a n 2 u u r 4 3 where x is the flow direction t is time g is acceleration due to gravity a is the cross sectional area for water passage b is the surface width q is river discharge u is flow velocity η is water level r is the hydraulic mean depth n is roughness q is the lateral inflow outflow inundation flows in low lying areas are calculated by a 2d unsteady flow model the continuity equation and the equation of motion for the 2d unsteady flow model are as follows 4 η t m x n y q 5 m t x m 2 d y mn d g d η x g n 2 d 7 3 m n 2 m 2 0 6 n t x mn d y n 2 d g d η y g n 2 d 7 3 n n 2 m 2 0 where m and n represent the linear flow rate in the x and y directions respectively q is the flow rate η is the water level h is water depth g is acceleration due to gravity d h η is the total water depth and n is roughness the kibagata lagoon located in the southern part of the target area is considered as a floodplain and is therefore not included in the inundation calculation the following homma s overflow formula is used to calculate overflow from the river channel to the inland area complete overflow h 2 h 1 2 3 7 q 0 35 h 1 2 g h 1 b submerged overflow h 2 h 1 2 3 8 q 0 91 h 2 2 g h 1 h 2 b where h 1 and h 2 represent the water depth measured from the bed height of a breached levee higher value should be h 1 and b is the width of the overflow if the inland water level is higher than that of the river channel the seamless model calculates the returning flow from the 2d model to the 1d river model for the kakehashi river basin the available sewerage network data was not enough to build a sewerage network model and a simple drainage model was developed the area was separated into drainage districts and drainage capacity was based on the drainage plan for the city of komatsu in the simple drainage model it was assumed that drainage pumps operate when the water level of the kakehashi river is lower than the embankment height the ratio of inland water volume to drainage capacity was multiplied by the inundation water amount in each cell to express the exclusion of inland water it was also assumed that the drainage pumps would be effective immediately the results of the runoff analyses from the rri model were used as boundary conditions for the upstream end of the 1d model and as lateral boundary conditions for the five branches kasukami river fuddaiji river nabetani river hatcho river and mae river the average observed tidal level for mikuni and kanazawa located to the south and north of the kakehashi river mouth respectively was used as the boundary condition at the downstream end of the 1d model to implement levee breach simulations the overflow section and time were identified by non levee breach simulations for each rainfall event levee breaching simulations were performed for each input rainfall in the simulations a single point i e right or left bank of a selected section of the levee was broken down a levee breach occurred when the water level in the 1d river model exceeded the planned high water level for the target river section settings of levee breach simulations were determined using the guidelines of the ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism mlit in japan from the guidelines the width of a levee breach at the termination time can be calculated using the following equations confluence 9 w b 2 0 log 10 w r 3 8 77 except for confluence 10 w b 1 6 log 10 w r 3 8 62 where wb is the final width of the levee breach and w r is the river width in the kakehashi river the breach width ranged from 87 to 110 m for each cross section but it was assumed to be uniformly 100 m in this study a levee is assumed to break across half of the final breach width at the start time however a levee breach experiment conducted in an experimental channel indicated a smaller breach width at the start time shimada et al 2011 therefore the initial levee breach width was set at 25 m in this study in the mlit guidelines the time for the final breach width to be realized is assumed as 1 h therefore the model was set such that the width of the levee breach expanded from 25 to 100 m over a duration of 1 h the flood flow caused by a levee breach and the inland flood were calculated using a surface flow model the spatial resolutions of the 1d river model and the 2d surface flow model were 200 and 40 m respectively in this study inundation was assumed to occur only from river flooding and inland waterlogging caused by rainfall was not considered the seamless model was validated using data of the heavy rainfall event that occurred in 2013 for that simulation the rainfall observed by the radar network named xrain was used as input data for the rri model there has been no levee breach on the kakehashi river since 1968 and validation data for the 2d surface model were unavailable fig 4 shows the observed water level at haneda during the flood in 2013 together with the result of the simulation of that event by the 1d river model in the seamless model despite some differences in the flood wave the peak water level of 5 16 m and 5 11 m for the observation and the simulation respectively demonstrates satisfactory reproducibility 2 4 preparation of input rainfall for runoff analysis and inundation simulations input rainfall for runoff analysis and inundation simulation were prepared based on wrf simulations for the kakehashi river basin 9 h rainfall was used as the design rainfall for flood prevention planning the target rainfall scenario for the kakehashi river was 145 mm 9h however the pgw wrf simulations showed much higher rainfall indicating that extreme rainfall events could be stronger in the future details shown in section 3 1 several pgw simulations produced basin mean rainfall of approximately 260 mm 9h to incorporate these extreme events and estimate the inundation risk potential the rainfall from the wrf simulations was stretched such that the basin mean rainfall became the level for multiple return periods to estimate the rainfall scenario i e 9 h rainfall for multiple return periods probability distribution models pdms were compared using the observed basin mean 9 h rainfall in the kakehashi river basin from 1940 to 2020 to determine the best fit pdms goodness of fit evaluations were conducted based on the standard least squares criterion slsc takara and takasao 1988 the fitted pdm was considered adequate at slsc values of 0 04 thirteen pdms were evaluated and three pdms the iwai s method 2 parameter lognormal distribution with the l moment method ln2lm and 2 parameter lognormal distribution with the moment method ln2pm produced the lowest slsc values 0 017 these three pdms were compared using akaike s information criterion aic akaike 1974 and error was estimated using the jackknife technique the lower value of the aic and jackknife error the better the pdm as shown in table 5 ln2pm showed the lowest values and was thus identified as the best fitting pdm by applying ln2pm the return period of rainfall of 260 mm 9h was estimated as 43 000 years rainfall scenarios or 9 h rainfall were estimated for multiple return periods shorter than 43 000 years table 6 the 9 h rainfall was estimated for each 500 year period from 500 to 3 000 years and defined for 5 mm intervals then the rainfall estimated by ln2pm was defined as the rainfall scenario for each return period table 6 finally the three selected wrf simulation results were stretched to obtain the target rainfall scenario for each rainfall scenario an abbreviation was defined for example rainfall of 177 mm 9h was termed r177 table 6 in this study three wrf simulation results were selected to generate the input rainfalls the details of the three selected rainfall events are described in section 3 1 these simulation results had similar spatial rainfall distributions but different temporal patterns 2 5 estimation of potential inundation risk rp to comprehensively evaluate inundation risk rp was calculated using two methods in method 1 rp was calculated as an expectation of the maximum inundation depth using the results of inundation simulations and the occurrence probabilities of each target rainfall event for a stochastic variable x that follows a discrete probability distribution expectation e x was calculated as follows 11 e x i 1 n x i p i where p is the occurrence probability the potential inundation risk per expectation rp e was then defined as follows 12 r p e i 1 n i i p i i 1 n i i w 1 i where ii is the maximum inundation depth simulated by the seamless model and pi is the occurrence probability for the i th return period based on the observed rainfall i is the number in the first column of table 6 w 1 i is the weight of ii used to calculate rp e same as pi considering future variations in the frequency of heavy rainfall events the application of occurrence probabilities based on past observations might be inadequate for example if the frequency of heavy rainfall increases with climate change rp e underestimates the risk of inundation in the future however it is difficult to estimate the future probability of heavy rainfall events from gcm outputs because of their uncertainty and coarse spatial resolution in this study based on ensemble pgw simulations a new method was developed to incorporate future variation in the probability of heavy rainfall events method 2 first the maximum 9 h rainfall was derived from each pgw simulation second a frequency distribution was estimated for the maximum 9 h rainfall fig 5 a third the cumulative distribution of the maximum 9 h rainfall and its fitted curve cumulative distribution curve were estimated fig 5b using the cumulative distribution curve a weight w2 was calculated then the potential inundation risk based on the cumulative distribution curve rp c was calculated as follows 13 r p c i 1 n i i 1 c i i 1 n i i w 2 i where ci is the cumulative probability value for the i th rainfall event i is the number in the first column of table 6 w2 was larger for smaller rainfall events with shorter return periods fig 5c the pgw method projects possible future heavy rainfall based on past extreme events the frequency distribution of the target rainfall scenario from pgw simulations fig 5a indicated possible variations in heavy rainfall events in the future by combining the pgw method and the ensemble simulation technique uncertainties in future climate were also considered in method 2 the estimation of w2 was interpreted as a variant of the past maximum method case for assessment of future climatic conditions both rp e and rp c were normalized between 0 0 and 1 0 to assess the relative risk distribution within the target area 3 results of simulations 3 1 results of numerical weather simulations fig 6 shows the spatial distribution of the observed and simulated total rainfall from july 28 30 2013 around the kakehashi river basin all results of the wrf simulations are ensemble means the hindcasting results showed heavy rainfall in the areas east and south of the kakehashi river basin similar to the observed rainfall in the rap data the heavy rainfall area over the ocean the northwestern part of the domain was wider in the hindcasting results than in the rap results there were some differences between the hindcasting and rap results but the wrf simulation well reproduced the heavy rainfall in 2013 the results of pgw 1 pgw 2 and pgw 4 were similar to those of the hindcast in pgw 3 the ensemble mean total rainfall around the kakehashi river basin was lower than that from the hindcast in pgw 5 a notable increase in total rainfall was found over wide area the results of the pgw simulations indicated that at least for the ensemble mean values the total amount of rainfall does not necessarily increase with climate change the hindcasting results for heavy rainfall events in 1998 and 2004 also reflected the observed rainfall distribution and showed various changes in the ensemble mean total rainfall with climate change see figs s2 and s3 in supplementary information fig 7 shows the basin mean total rainfall and the mean maximum hourly rainfall in the wrf simulations for 1998 the hindcast basin mean total rainfall r t ranged from 135 to 206 mm and the ensemble mean value was 157 mm fig 7a and table 7 while the observed basin mean total rainfall was 145 mm therefore the hindcast r t was slightly overestimated the r t values from the pgw ranged widely i e from 18 to 305 mm in pgw 2 the r t values were substantially lower than those of the hindcast whereas the results for pgw 3 and pgw 4 were close to the hindcast results the mean r t values for pgw 1 and pgw 5 were higher in comparison with the hindcast for four of the five pgw runs the maximum r t value was higher than that for the hindcast table 7 the basin mean maximum hourly rainfall r h of 36 49 mm h for the hindcast fig 7a is comparable with the results for pgw 3 and pgw 5 but higher than the values for pgw 2 and pgw 4 pgw 1 showed clear intensification of r h as with r t only two pgw runs showed ensemble mean r h values higher than the hindcast values however the maximum r h value for each of the pgw runs was higher than that of the hindcast table 7 these results indicate that although average heavy rainfall could remain the same extreme rainfall events could become more intense in the future in the case of 2004 ensemble spreads of r t and r h were small in the hindcast pgw 1 pgw 3 and pgw 4 fig 7b it is thought that the differences between the first three members of the lsp method i e x1 x2 and x3 were small in these ensemble simulations the r t and r h values for pgw 3 and pgw 4 were clearly smaller than those of the hindcast the results of pgw 1 were comparable with those of the hindcast fig 7b but the ensemble mean and maximum r t and r h values were higher than the those of the hindcast table 7 although the ensemble mean r t and r h values of pgw 2 were lower than those of the hindcast in 1998 they were larger in 2004 many members of pgw 2 showed higher r t and r h values than the hindcast these results indicate the various effects of climate change on heavy rainfall events even within small areas the results of pgw 5 showed an increasing trend in both r t and r h for 2013 the r t and r h values ranged widely but the results indicated intensification of heavy rainfall events in the future in particular the r h values for all pgw simulations showed that both the ensemble mean and the maximum values were larger than those of the hindcast table 7 results for 1998 and 2013 indicated a high possibility of intensification of short duration heavy rainfall events such variations would cause more severe flooding in the future fig 7 and table 7 show that rainfall characteristics are likely to change in the future they also highlight the complexity of the effects of climate change on heavy rainfall events it is difficult to estimate future variations in heavy rainfall events based on a specific heavy rainfall event and a specific pgw simulation result therefore all the members of the five pgw ensemble simulations were assumed to be one set of samples to estimate the frequency distribution of future heavy rainfall 3 2 results of runoff analyses and inundation simulations as stated in section 2 4 three pgw simulations were selected to generate boundary conditions for runoff analyses and those results were stretched to create the target rainfall scenarios fig 8 shows parts of the temporal variations in the basin mean rainfall estimated for each return period the maximum hourly rainfall was 67 7 mm h at r260 in case 2 fig 8b the record maximum hourly rainfall in komatsu was 65 mm recorded in 2012 thus the future rainfall shown in fig 8 is considered possible fig 9 shows river discharge at haneda station for several target rainfall scenarios in the three simulations cases 1 3 the peak rain rate for the same rainfall scenario was highest in case 2 fig 8 but the maximum discharge for the same rainfall scenario was highest in case 1 overflow sections are listed in table 8 in case 1 flooding from r190 or rainfall of 190 mm 9h exceeded the designed water level at section 24 however in cases 2 and 3 there was no overflow of the kakehashi river with r190 even with the same rainfall scenario the maximum discharge differed among the cases fig 9 because of different rainfall patterns fig 8 for other rainfall scenarios some differences were observed in the overflow sections using the overflow information levee breaching simulations were implemented for each rainfall scenario and overflow section fig 10 shows composites of the maximum inundation depth for each rainfall scenario in the case of both r190 and r197 the inundation area spread on the left bank of the kakehashi river at sections 20 and 24 the flood flow did not spread out on the right bank when the discharge amount was low because of the surrounding topographic features in the case of r202 inundation areas were seen on both sides of the kakehashi river wider inundation areas and greater inundation depths were found with higher rainfall scenarios 4 evaluation of potential inundation risk fig 11 a shows the frequency distribution of the maximum 9 h rainfall for the kakehashi river basin derived from the pgw ensemble simulations the results reflect the future occurrence probability of each rainfall scenario under atmospheric conditions similar to those for the heavy rainfall events in 1998 2004 and 2013 the occurrence frequency indicates that even a rainfall scenario with a 43 000 year return period 260 mm 9h could occur by the end of the 21st century such a rainfall scenario will no longer be rare under future climatic conditions and rainfall events with very long return periods e g longer than 1 000 years under past and present climatic conditions should be considered in future risk evaluations based on the frequency distribution in fig 11a the weighting for each return period w2 was calculated see section 2 5 fig 11b shows the cumulative probability density derived from the occurrence frequency presented in fig 11a a fitted curve is also shown in fig 11b the fitted curve is the value of the cumulative distribution function ci with the assumption of a normal distribution as described in section 2 5 the weight for the i th return period w2 i was defined as w2 i 1 ci the value of w2 for weak rainfall was large and the value of w2 for extreme heavy rainfall was small fig 12 shows the spatial distribution of rp estimated using the two methods described previously the results in fig 12 are standardized from 0 to 1 here rp e was estimated using method 1 with w1 occurrence probability and calculated as the expectation of the maximum inundation depth the spatial distribution of higher risk areas rp e 0 1 is similar to that of the maximum inundation depth for r190 fig 10a areas where inundation occurred only as a result of rainfall with longer return periods were classified as low risk the occurrence probability of rainfall events with a longer return period was not low fig 11a for example a rainfall scenario of 240 mm 9h return period of approximately 15 000 years was projected to occur frequently by the end of the 21st century the effects of extreme rainfalls e g 240 mm 9h could be negligibly underestimated by method 1 and the future inundation risk in the low risk area in fig 12a might not be as low as estimated the potential inundation risk rp c calculated using method 2 with w2 is shown in fig 12b it can be seen that rp c values of 0 1 spread over a wide area on both sides of the kakehashi river simultaneously the spatial distribution of areas with rp c values of 0 1 was not similar to any of the results shown in fig 10 areas flooded by 1 000 year return period rainfall were at greater risk fig 12b moreover the area with inundation depth of 1 m light blue in fig 10 was also classified as higher risk areas with rare and large inundation depths 1 0 m and areas with frequent and small inundation depths were evaluated as high risk areas as seen in fig 11 extreme rainfall e g 230 mm 9h with a return period of 9 000 years in the present climate will not be rare in the future the weights used in methods 1 and 2 are shown in table 9 compared with w2 the difference between w1 for r190 and other rainfall scenarios was very large method 1 might underestimate the effects of larger rainfall scenarios and thus it is unsuitable for future flood assessment method 2 is more suitable because the nonstationarity or variations in occurrence frequency of extreme heavy rainfall events in the future is properly considered 5 discussion 5 1 estimation of future rainfall an ensemble simulation technique has the advantage of increasing the number of samples and of considering a wide variety of rainfall patterns that might occur under certain global warming conditions numerical weather prediction models are not perfect and have various sources of uncertainty however by applying an ensemble pgw simulation technique it is possible to estimate the rainfall that could occur under atmospheric conditions likely to produce heavy rainfall events under the effects of climate change the pgw simulation results for individual heavy rainfall events show that for the heavy rainfall event that occurred in 2013 the total and the maximum hourly rainfall will be larger in the future for most of the five global warming projection results considered in this study however complex behaviors were also observed regarding future variations in heavy rainfall for example pgw 3 tended to produce smaller total and maximum rainfall than that of the hindcast and the other pgws for the 1998 event but tended to produce the largest rainfall for the 2004 event these results suggest that even a single gcm can produce different tendencies of future variations depending on rainfall events if the effects of global warming are different for each rainfall type estimating future rainfall using statistical methods might prove difficult while it is convenient to estimate the average heavy rainfall trend from future projections using a gcm some types of rainfalls that show trends of variation different to the average variation might be missed in addition to understanding the average tendency of future variation in heavy rainfall it is also necessary to investigate whether there are differences in the variation tendencies depending on the cause and location of the rainfall a pgw dynamic downscaling approach has the advantage of representing localized heavy rainfall but with a heavy computational load moreover the computational load increases with implementation of ensemble simulations and use of global warming projection results from multiple gcms and multiple greenhouse gas emission scenarios while ensemble pgw dynamic downscaling has multiple advantages e g examining differences in the effects of global warming for individual weather events and obtaining a large number of samples for probabilistic assessments it might not be realistic for performing a large number of simulations for individual river basins to conduct future risk assessments for various river basins it will be indispensable to develop a fast and simple rainfall estimation method that does not compromise the advantages of ensemble pgw dynamic downscaling in this study the results of pgw simulations based on multiple gcms were considered as one sample however there are differences in the reproducibility of the present climate by each gcm and there are also differences in the reliability of future projections therefore it is also necessary to develop a method for utilizing rainfall information that considers the reliability of each gcm when used in an ensemble of multiple gcms additionally it is also important to update information on future variations in heavy rainfall using the latest global warming projections it is expected that use of reliable gcms and the latest global warming projection will enable estimation of the appropriate range of uncertainty or future variations of heavy rainfall 5 2 evaluation of potential inundation risk as shown in fig 10 inundation conditions vary greatly depending on the magnitude of the heavy rainfall on the left bank of the kakehashi river there are areas inundated to the depth of 0 3 m with the rainfall of r190 and to the depth of 0 5 1 m with the rainfall of r260 the right bank of the kakehashi river is not inundated by rainfall such as that of r190 and r197 however these areas are inundated to the depth of 1 2 m by the rainfall of r260 therefore it is important to determine how best to evaluate risk in areas with high frequency and little inundation and in areas with low frequency and substantial inundation in this study a new flood risk assessment method was developed that considers future variations in rainfall characteristics it is essential to consider the uncertainty of climate change in assessment of future flood risk and necessary to introduce statistical assessment methods however there are several disadvantages to assessing flood risks as an expected value based on occurrence probabilities as shown in fig 12a the use of occurrence probabilities based on past observations might underestimate the risk of extreme rainfall events that might occur in the future such underestimation could be avoided if the appropriate occurrence probability under the effects of climate change could be estimated however this is unlikely to be possible first it is difficult to implement long term high resolution simulations to obtain future rainfall information as stated in section 5 1 second the probability of heavy rainfall might be nonstationary under global warming and it might be inappropriate to extend the time period to obtain a large number of samples for example if the climatic conditions in the 2070 s and 2090 s are different it would be inappropriate to group the years 2070 2100 into a single target period to obtain a large sample of extreme events that could occur over a relatively short period ensemble pgw simulation with climate anomalies for the period of interest could prove effective if the time period for creating an anomaly is short it might not be possible to estimate the rainfall for a particular return period in this sense the proposed method utilizing the occurrence frequency and its cumulative probability method 2 is useful for future flood risk assessment selection of an optimal probability distribution function is necessary to calculate the occurrence probability for multiple return periods method 1 but method 2 does not require a probability distribution function which has the advantage of simplifying the evaluation procedure however there are some points to be considered in relation to method 2 for example all results obtained from the pgw ensemble simulations were used to estimate the cumulative probability including cases with 9 h rainfall of 20 or 30 mm fig 11 rainfall of this magnitude can occur annually e g the minimum annual maximum daily precipitation in komatsu during 1978 2021 was 43 mm and is unlikely to cause a disaster further study will be required to determine the lower limit of rainfall necessary to estimate a cumulative probability curve it is also interesting to examine whether a small number of samples could be used to estimate an appropriate cumulative distribution function this study did not consider the effects of internal water flooding inundation conditions can vary depending on internal flooding because sewage systems generally have a lower safety level than rivers inundation due to inland waterlogging is more likely to occur in a situation where a levee breach occurs on the main river there is high possibility of internal waterlogging and the depth of flooding tend to be larger taniguchi and shibuo 2018 kitamura et al 2021 for a more realistic assessment of flood risk it is necessary to consider the simultaneous occurrence of internal flooding and river flooding the rainfall intensity that causes internal water logging can also determine the lower rainfall limit of the cumulative distribution used in method 2 when considering internal water logging an appropriate drainage model is essential since the simple drainage model in this study drains water instantaneously there is a possibility that the inundation depth and inundation area may be underestimated or the inundation duration may be calculated short the timing of inflow into the river by the drainage pump may also be earlier which may make it easier for river water levels to rise and shorten the duration of floods it is also a future task to improve the simple drainage model such as expressing delays in drainage method 2 can identify high risk areas both those with low frequency of severe inundation and those with high frequency of light inundation however the measures required in the two areas will differ and it is matter of discussion to determine which should be prioritized using method 2 to evaluate economic losses it might be possible to generate information that contributes to the selection of areas where flood control measures should be implemented as a priority 6 conclusions uncertainties in future climate projections should be considered in both hazard estimations and risk analyses in this study several possible extreme future rainfall scenarios were estimated using pgw ensemble simulations for the kakehashi river in japan potential inundation risks were calculated using the probability of future precipitation events and simulated inundation depths the pgw ensemble simulations were applied to three heavy rainfall events in the kakehashi river basin using future projections based on the rcp8 5 emissions scenario even though the ensemble mean values of total rainfall and maximum hourly rainfall were similar between the hindcast and the pgw simulations the maximum values or extreme rainfalls tended to be higher under future climatic conditions future increases were more significant for maximum hourly rainfall than for total rainfall during the target period frequency analysis of the 9 h rainfall which is used for flood prevention planning in the kakehashi river basin showed that heavy rainfall events with very long return periods 1 000 years in the present climate could occur more frequently as the climate changes indicating high probability of flood intensification in the future based on the inundation simulation results for multiple rainfall scenarios potential inundation risks were calculated using two methods in method 1 the potential inundation risk rp e was calculated as an expectation value using the occurrence probabilities of rainfall and the maximum inundation depths for multiple return periods in this method the areas where inundation occurred only with longer return period rainfall were evaluated as low risk areas in method 2 a cumulative probability function derived from the frequency of 9 h rainfall scenarios from the pgw ensemble simulations were used to calculate the potential inundation risk rp c the rp c indicated that both areas with high frequency low inundation depths and those with low frequency high inundation depths were evaluated as areas of higher risk in method 1 the occurrence probabilities were estimated from past observations in this case the effects of extreme rainfall events which are likely to occur more frequently in the future might be underestimated as shown in this study heavy rainfall events with return periods of 1 000 years might occur more often to consider such possibilities future risks should be assessed based on future precipitation scenarios the cumulative probability function used in method 2 was based on the results of the pgw ensemble simulations future inundation risks were assessed based on future stochastic information and were independent of past and present stochastic features this study highlighted the possibility of intensification of heavy rainfall in the future in particular it is important that even heavy rainfall events that are currently extremely rare might occur more frequently in the future future flood risks might be underestimated if only current and past rainfall data are used and thus flood risk assessments should incorporate future variability in rainfall events for that purpose the pgw ensemble simulation is very useful for modeling possible future rainfall this study also proposed a new method method 2 for evaluating future potential inundation risk independently of present rainfall patterns although further improvement is possible the method provides a basic framework for future flood risk evaluation ensemble numerical simulations can produce many samples but the computational needs are great in the future it will be necessary to develop a downscaling method that can physically represent future climate change with a smaller computational load accurate simulation results with various rainfall inputs are indispensable for reliable risk assessment in runoff analysis some rainfall events reduced the accuracy of the simulation improvement and optimization of the rri model is also an important issue for realistic risk assessment inland waterlogging should also be considered for that purpose it will be essential to develop a method for determining appropriate spatial and temporal patterns of input rainfall for flood risk assessment credit authorship

2872,the projected increase in the frequency of extreme rainfall events with climate change has serious implications for flood risk management this study developed a novel method to evaluate future flood inundation risk in the kakehashi river basin japan first a pseudo global warming pgw method and ensemble simulation techniques were combined to develop rainfall projections with different return periods based on the weather research and forecasting wrf model second runoff analyses were performed for the target river basin and inundation simulations including levee breaches were conducted at high spatial resolution 40 40 m finally the potential inundation risk for the river basin was estimated rainfall simulation results indicated intensification of short duration heavy rainfall events the pgw ensemble simulations indicated that extreme rainfall scenarios with long return periods 1000 years based on current conditions are likely to occur more frequently in the future highlighting the possibility of flood intensification regardless of the length of return period areas with infrequent flooding but large inundation depth and those with more frequent flooding but small inundation depth were classified as high risk the proposed method provides a baseline framework for future flood risk assessments and the results highlight the importance of incorporating currently rare heavy rainfall events in future flood management evaluation and planning keywords flood risk assessment inundation pseudo global warming climate change ensemble simulation data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction the frequency and magnitude of precipitation extremes are projected to increase because of climate change ipcc 2012 2014 assessments of future flood risk as a result of extreme rainfall events are vital given the enormous impacts of such events on people communities and ecosystems aerts 2009 estimated the adaptation costs of flood protection under various climate change scenarios for the netherlands which ranged from 9 to 80 billion euros depending on the climate scenario used in future flood risk assessments the uncertainties inherent in future climate projections should be considered future climatic conditions have been projected using various global climate models gcms for multiple greenhouse gas emissions scenarios taylor et al 2012 kundzewicz et al 2014 reviewed the projected variation in rainfall and floods for various regions of the world reported in the special report on managing the risks of extreme events and disasters to advance climate change adaptation srex report they found that there was low confidence in projections of fluvial floods likely attributable to uncertainty regarding future climate projections using 21 gcm projections arnell and gosling 2016 investigated future river flood risk at the global scale and found wide variations in the projections similarly collet et al 2017 examined future extreme river runoff projections for great britain and concluded that the uncertainty in extreme climate change projections must be considered in future risk assessments lopez cantu et al 2020 investigated future variations of extreme rainfalls in u s using multiple gcm output and multiple global warming scenarios 227 projections to take into account for uncertainties garrote et al 2021 developed probabilistic flood maps for the city of zamoa spain and showed that flood risk may be underestimated without consideration of uncertainties in flood frequency probabilistic evaluations can be used to account for variations in climate projections and the resulting uncertainty regarding future risks in this context ensemble simulations are useful for incorporating the chaotic behavior of meteorological phenomena and uncertainties in forcing data new et al 2007 used ensemble rainfall runoff simulations to generate probabilistic risk assessments using the results of gcm simulations for various greenhouse gas emission scenarios ward et al 2014 implemented hydrological simulations for the rhine river based on a 3000 year time series of climatic conditions and developed a probability distribution of future flood risk based on daily and extreme discharges xu et al 2017 estimated future variations in flood exceedance probability based on hydrological simulations driven by future rainfall projections alfieri et al 2015 used ensemble climate projections to assess the intensity and frequency of extreme flood events for europe and found that on average the frequency of floods with return periods of 100 years or more doubled within 30 years in probabilistic risk evaluation research stochastic methods are applied to generates a large number of samples and flood risk is evaluated oubennaceur et al 2019 stochastically generated 1000 discharge samples and estimated flood damage for each sample and calculated the average flood loss for the richelieu river in canada kheradmand et al 2018 applied a probabilistic framework to estimate flood risk for the city of niamey niger the peak discharge values for the niger river were calculated 1000 times by using statistical methods and flood damage was estimated for multiple return periods garrote et al 2021 applied the monte carlo method to consider the uncertainty of extreme floods in zamora city spain 500 peak flow were generated by a statistical method and flood hazard for each return period were estimated in many studies risk assessment is performed for each target return period and there are few cases in which comprehensive evaluations are made based on the risks of multiple return period oliver et al 2018 generated 1000 year flood flow data and calculated damage and loss for each return period for the upper koshi river in nepal then by considering the annual frequency of occurrence of the flood event and the mean loss value of flood for each return period the average annual loss aal was calculated the aal is a kind of comprehensive risk index based on floods with multiple return period in oliver et al 2019 the aal was estimated by 5000 year flood flow for four river basins in uttarakhand india traditionally flood management planning is based on return periods estimated from past observations however under future climatic conditions rainfall patterns will differ from those of the present climate using 17 models in coupled model intercomparison project 5 cmip5 guo et al 2016 showed that precipitation extremes in china will become more frequent and more intense with climate change li et al 2018 investigated future variation in the magnitude and probability of extreme precipitation in china with 1 5 and 2 0 c increases in the global average temperature they found that the frequency of previously rare events extreme precipitation was projected to increase with a 2 0 c temperature rise consideration of the nonstationarity of future precipitation is essential for flood risk evaluation and management šraj et al 2016 estimated flood quantiles using stationary and nonstationary models and found that stationary models underestimated flood events in recent years highlighting the necessity of considering nonstationarity slater et al 2021 argued that nonstationarity increase the uncertainty and pointed out that the large uncertainty can be problematic to flood prevention various studies have been conducted on the impact of nonstationarity on uncertainty and flood risk assessment obeysekera and salas 2014 hu et al 2022 naseri and hummel 2022 cheng and aghakouchak 2014 also showed that under changing climatic conditions the assumption of precipitation stationarity is no longer correct return periods traditionally used for extreme events are no longer applicable in the context of climate change and previous studies have reported increase in the frequency of extreme events such as 100 year floods gilroy and mccuen 2012 rojas et al 2012 super typhoons lin et al 2016 and extreme rainfall events ranger et al 2011 le et al 2021 the nonstationarity of future climate conditions can be considered using a coupled method incorporating a pseudo global warming pgw downscaling technique and ensemble simulations high resolution data regarding future high impact weather events are indispensable for impact assessment in river basins dynamic downscaling results of gcms are strongly influenced by their bias kato et al 2001 in the pgw method future climatic conditions are generated by coupling reanalysis data and future climatic anomalies downscaling results of pgw conditions are expected to reflect the impact of global warming on the actual present climate then future dynamic downscaling results derived by pgw forcing can be compared directly with present downscaling results of reanalysis data some previous studies have used pgw and dynamic downscaling to evaluate a range of high impact weather events e g hill and lackmann 2011 lackmann 2015 marciano et al 2015 taniguchi and sho 2015 dynamic downscaling can be used to obtain detailed characteristics of high impact weather events but numerous samples from model simulations are necessary to investigate the patterns of extreme weather events under future climate scenarios taniguchi 2018 developed a simple ensemble simulation technique to produce numerous samples using a numerical weather prediction model when applied to a past typhoon event by coupling with the pgw technique the stochastic characteristics of future extreme rainfall were illustrated based on multiple ensemble members however simply showing various possibilities is insufficient for development of specific flood disaster prevention plans this study developed a novel technique for calculating potential inundation risk rp first an ensemble pgw technique was used to produce high resolution future heavy rainfall event projections with various return periods based on past rainfall events in the kakehashi river basin japan second runoff analyses and inundation simulations were implemented for the kakehashi river basin to obtain various inundation depths then the outputs of the inundation simulations and rainfall projections were combined to calculate rp 2 methods 2 1 overview of the kakehashi river basin the kakehashi river is a class 1 river that flows through ishikawa prefecture in japan the river starts at mt suzugadake in the dainichizan mountain range of mt hakusan flows north on the mountain and joins several branches goutani river kasukami river fuddaiji river before entering the plains fig 1 subsequently the nabetani hatcho and mae rivers join the kakehashi river before it reaches the sea of japan the main path of the river is 42 km long and the basin area is 271 2 km2 most of which accommodates the city of komatsu the second largest city in ishikawa prefecture to date the highest recorded water level of the river was during a heavy rainfall event in july 2013 2 2 data data from the national centers for environmental prediction final ncep fnl operational global analysis were used national centers for environmental prediction national weather service noaa u s department of commerce 2000 for the initial and boundary conditions of the hindcast simulations and the base state conditions for the pgw simulations ncep fnl data have been generated by the global data assimilation system gdas at ncep from 1999 to the near present the spatial and temporal resolutions of the ncep fnl data are 1 1 and 6 h respectively ncep fnl data are available for the surface

temperature sea surface temperature sst soil temperature soil moisture relative humidity u and v component winds and vertical motion were included as initial and boundary conditions for the lower boundary conditions of the numerical weather simulations ssts from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa optimum interpolation 1 4 daily sst noaa oi sst analysis data reynolds et al 2007 were used different types of observational data from satellites ships and buoys are combined to generate noaa oi ssts in terms of satellite data ssts from the advanced very high resolution radiometer avhrr and advanced microwave scanning radiometer for the earth observing system amsr e were used the spatial resolution of the noaa oi sst dataset is 0 25 0 25 the initial and boundary conditions for the pgw simulations were generated from the ncep fnl data and future climate projections from five different gcms developed for cmip5 taylor et al 2012 in cmip5 multiple atmospheric greenhouse gas concentration scenarios i e representative concentration pathways rcps are applied in this study future projections based on the rcp8 5 scenario radiative forcing of the earth in 2100 of 8 5 w m2 greater than the preindustrial level were used to develop the pgw conditions the five gcms used in this study are listed in table 1 details of the pgw method are described in section 2 3 rainfall in the hindcast simulations was compared with radar amedas precipitation rap data which combine weather radar observations and surface precipitation observations from the automated meteorological data acquisition system amedas of the japan meteorological agency these data have high spatial resolution 5 km until march 2001 2 5 km from march 2001 and 1 km from 2006 and temporal resolution of 1 h rap data were considered appropriate for verifying the hindcast simulations makihara et al 1996 2 3 models and simulation settings 2 3 1 rainfall simulations possible extreme rainfall events were simulated using a numerical weather simulation model combined with the pgw method the weather research and forecasting wrf model skamarock et al 2008 version 3 7 1 was used applying a two way three level nesting approach fig 2 the spatial resolutions for the parent intermediate and child domains were 30 10 and 3 333 km respectively the lin ice scheme lin et al 1983 and betts miller janjic scheme janjic 1994 2000 were used for microphysics and cumulus parameterizations respectively the physical processes of the surface layer and the land surface were calculated using the eta model based on the monin obukhov length with the zilitinkevich thermal roughness length skamarock et al 2008 and the noah land surface model chen and dudhia 2001 respectively planetary boundary layer processes were calculated using the mellor yamada nakanishi and niino level 3 scheme nakanishi and niino 2009 a simple rapid radiative transfer model was used for longwave and shortwave radiation iacono et al 2008 a spectral nudging method was applied for atmospheric temperature zonal wind meridional wind and geopotential height every 6 h above the height of 6 7 km for the parent domain an outline of these settings is presented in table 2 based on sato et al 2007 pgw conditions were generated by combining ncep fnl data with future climatological anomalies derived from five gcm projections future 10 year monthly means were calculated for the period 2091 2100 using the rcp8 5 emissions scenario for each gcm present conditions were calculated as 10 year monthly means from 1991 to 2000 using the historical runs future climatological anomalies were calculated as the difference in the 10 year monthly mean conditions for the future and present twenty year mean climate conditions are often used in climatological studies however 10 year mean conditions were used here to evaluate the effects of advanced global warming conditions at the end of the 21st century these anomalies were added to the 6 h atmospheric conditions from the ncep fnl data then pgw conditions were obtained for wind atmospheric temperature geopotential height and surface pressure for relative humidity the original ncep fnl values were preserved and specific humidity under pgw was calculated from the relative humidity and modified atmospheric temperature of the future climate the ssts for the pgw conditions were generated by adding future sst anomalies obtained from each gcm to the noaa oi ssts the pgw experiments were termed pgw 1 pgw 2 pgw 3 and so on based on the number of the gcm used table 1 an ensemble simulation technique was adopted to obtain multiple simulation results for probabilistic evaluation of heavy rainfall events the lagged simulated perturbation lsp method taniguchi 2018 was used for ensemble simulations the lsp method can be applied to any type of high impact weather event and simulations can be started at an arbitrary time and date the lsp method consists of three steps first three simulations were implemented with different initial times to obtain three base state vectors s 1 s 2 and s 3 at a set interruption time second difference vectors δ s 2 and δ s 3 were defined as the differences between s 2 and s 1 and between s 3 and s 1 respectively third new state vectors s n were generated from three vectors s 1 δ s 2 and δ s 3 as follows 1 s n s 1 α δ s 2 β δ s 3 where α and β are scale factors for δ s 2 and δ s 3 respectively then the simulations were restarted from the interruption time with the new state vector s n in s n atmospheric temperature zonal and meridional wind components specific humidity atmospheric pressure and sst were updated nineteen ensemble members were generated for the hindcast and five pgw simulations using the scale factors shown in table 3 the initial and interruption times of the simulations are shown in table 4 2 3 2 rainfall runoff inundation rri model a rainfall runoff inundation rri model sayama et al 2012 was used to estimate river discharge in the kakehashi river basin the rri model is a fully coupled rainfall runoff and hydraulic inundation model slopes and rivers were assumed within the same grid cell and the river channel was considered to be a single line on the overlying slope cells a two dimensional 2d diffusive wave model was applied to estimate flow over the slope and a one dimensional 1d diffusive model was adopted for the main channel flow elevation flow direction and flow accumulation for the kakehashi river basin were generated from hydrological maps based on shuttle elevation derivatives at multiple scales hydrosheds fifteen arcsecond resolution approximately 500 m data products were used in this study the modeled basin and flow accumulation are shown in fig 3 a in the rri model several infiltration and ground water options were applied because of the wet summer conditions in japan excess overland flow with the assumption of a saturated subsurface was applied to validate the settings the rri model was applied to five flood events in the kakehashi river basin fig s1 supplementary information presents hydrographs and hyetographs for the five flood events in all cases the initial flush was reproduced well but there were some differences in the peak discharge amounts the nash sutcliffe coefficients are 0 90 0 65 0 73 0 74 and 0 42 for the five events average 0 69 some results showed low accuracy but generally the rri settings were considered suitable 2 3 3 seamless model a seamlessly integrated inundation simulation model hereafter the seamless model was developed to incorporate the various factors that influence inundation in urbanized areas sanuki et al 2016 the seamless model consists of a 1d river model 2d surface flow model and a sewage network model fig 3b shows the area of the inundation simulation the 1d river model covers a 12 4 km section from the mouth of the kakehashi river the continuity equation and the equation of motion can be expressed as follows 2 b η t q x q 3 q t uq x g a η x g a n 2 u u r 4 3 where x is the flow direction t is time g is acceleration due to gravity a is the cross sectional area for water passage b is the surface width q is river discharge u is flow velocity η is water level r is the hydraulic mean depth n is roughness q is the lateral inflow outflow inundation flows in low lying areas are calculated by a 2d unsteady flow model the continuity equation and the equation of motion for the 2d unsteady flow model are as follows 4 η t m x n y q 5 m t x m 2 d y mn d g d η x g n 2 d 7 3 m n 2 m 2 0 6 n t x mn d y n 2 d g d η y g n 2 d 7 3 n n 2 m 2 0 where m and n represent the linear flow rate in the x and y directions respectively q is the flow rate η is the water level h is water depth g is acceleration due to gravity d h η is the total water depth and n is roughness the kibagata lagoon located in the southern part of the target area is considered as a floodplain and is therefore not included in the inundation calculation the following homma s overflow formula is used to calculate overflow from the river channel to the inland area complete overflow h 2 h 1 2 3 7 q 0 35 h 1 2 g h 1 b submerged overflow h 2 h 1 2 3 8 q 0 91 h 2 2 g h 1 h 2 b where h 1 and h 2 represent the water depth measured from the bed height of a breached levee higher value should be h 1 and b is the width of the overflow if the inland water level is higher than that of the river channel the seamless model calculates the returning flow from the 2d model to the 1d river model for the kakehashi river basin the available sewerage network data was not enough to build a sewerage network model and a simple drainage model was developed the area was separated into drainage districts and drainage capacity was based on the drainage plan for the city of komatsu in the simple drainage model it was assumed that drainage pumps operate when the water level of the kakehashi river is lower than the embankment height the ratio of inland water volume to drainage capacity was multiplied by the inundation water amount in each cell to express the exclusion of inland water it was also assumed that the drainage pumps would be effective immediately the results of the runoff analyses from the rri model were used as boundary conditions for the upstream end of the 1d model and as lateral boundary conditions for the five branches kasukami river fuddaiji river nabetani river hatcho river and mae river the average observed tidal level for mikuni and kanazawa located to the south and north of the kakehashi river mouth respectively was used as the boundary condition at the downstream end of the 1d model to implement levee breach simulations the overflow section and time were identified by non levee breach simulations for each rainfall event levee breaching simulations were performed for each input rainfall in the simulations a single point i e right or left bank of a selected section of the levee was broken down a levee breach occurred when the water level in the 1d river model exceeded the planned high water level for the target river section settings of levee breach simulations were determined using the guidelines of the ministry of land infrastructure transport and tourism mlit in japan from the guidelines the width of a levee breach at the termination time can be calculated using the following equations confluence 9 w b 2 0 log 10 w r 3 8 77 except for confluence 10 w b 1 6 log 10 w r 3 8 62 where wb is the final width of the levee breach and w r is the river width in the kakehashi river the breach width ranged from 87 to 110 m for each cross section but it was assumed to be uniformly 100 m in this study a levee is assumed to break across half of the final breach width at the start time however a levee breach experiment conducted in an experimental channel indicated a smaller breach width at the start time shimada et al 2011 therefore the initial levee breach width was set at 25 m in this study in the mlit guidelines the time for the final breach width to be realized is assumed as 1 h therefore the model was set such that the width of the levee breach expanded from 25 to 100 m over a duration of 1 h the flood flow caused by a levee breach and the inland flood were calculated using a surface flow model the spatial resolutions of the 1d river model and the 2d surface flow model were 200 and 40 m respectively in this study inundation was assumed to occur only from river flooding and inland waterlogging caused by rainfall was not considered the seamless model was validated using data of the heavy rainfall event that occurred in 2013 for that simulation the rainfall observed by the radar network named xrain was used as input data for the rri model there has been no levee breach on the kakehashi river since 1968 and validation data for the 2d surface model were unavailable fig 4 shows the observed water level at haneda during the flood in 2013 together with the result of the simulation of that event by the 1d river model in the seamless model despite some differences in the flood wave the peak water level of 5 16 m and 5 11 m for the observation and the simulation respectively demonstrates satisfactory reproducibility 2 4 preparation of input rainfall for runoff analysis and inundation simulations input rainfall for runoff analysis and inundation simulation were prepared based on wrf simulations for the kakehashi river basin 9 h rainfall was used as the design rainfall for flood prevention planning the target rainfall scenario for the kakehashi river was 145 mm 9h however the pgw wrf simulations showed much higher rainfall indicating that extreme rainfall events could be stronger in the future details shown in section 3 1 several pgw simulations produced basin mean rainfall of approximately 260 mm 9h to incorporate these extreme events and estimate the inundation risk potential the rainfall from the wrf simulations was stretched such that the basin mean rainfall became the level for multiple return periods to estimate the rainfall scenario i e 9 h rainfall for multiple return periods probability distribution models pdms were compared using the observed basin mean 9 h rainfall in the kakehashi river basin from 1940 to 2020 to determine the best fit pdms goodness of fit evaluations were conducted based on the standard least squares criterion slsc takara and takasao 1988 the fitted pdm was considered adequate at slsc values of 0 04 thirteen pdms were evaluated and three pdms the iwai s method 2 parameter lognormal distribution with the l moment method ln2lm and 2 parameter lognormal distribution with the moment method ln2pm produced the lowest slsc values 0 017 these three pdms were compared using akaike s information criterion aic akaike 1974 and error was estimated using the jackknife technique the lower value of the aic and jackknife error the better the pdm as shown in table 5 ln2pm showed the lowest values and was thus identified as the best fitting pdm by applying ln2pm the return period of rainfall of 260 mm 9h was estimated as 43 000 years rainfall scenarios or 9 h rainfall were estimated for multiple return periods shorter than 43 000 years table 6 the 9 h rainfall was estimated for each 500 year period from 500 to 3 000 years and defined for 5 mm intervals then the rainfall estimated by ln2pm was defined as the rainfall scenario for each return period table 6 finally the three selected wrf simulation results were stretched to obtain the target rainfall scenario for each rainfall scenario an abbreviation was defined for example rainfall of 177 mm 9h was termed r177 table 6 in this study three wrf simulation results were selected to generate the input rainfalls the details of the three selected rainfall events are described in section 3 1 these simulation results had similar spatial rainfall distributions but different temporal patterns 2 5 estimation of potential inundation risk rp to comprehensively evaluate inundation risk rp was calculated using two methods in method 1 rp was calculated as an expectation of the maximum inundation depth using the results of inundation simulations and the occurrence probabilities of each target rainfall event for a stochastic variable x that follows a discrete probability distribution expectation e x was calculated as follows 11 e x i 1 n x i p i where p is the occurrence probability the potential inundation risk per expectation rp e was then defined as follows 12 r p e i 1 n i i p i i 1 n i i w 1 i where ii is the maximum inundation depth simulated by the seamless model and pi is the occurrence probability for the i th return period based on the observed rainfall i is the number in the first column of table 6 w 1 i is the weight of ii used to calculate rp e same as pi considering future variations in the frequency of heavy rainfall events the application of occurrence probabilities based on past observations might be inadequate for example if the frequency of heavy rainfall increases with climate change rp e underestimates the risk of inundation in the future however it is difficult to estimate the future probability of heavy rainfall events from gcm outputs because of their uncertainty and coarse spatial resolution in this study based on ensemble pgw simulations a new method was developed to incorporate future variation in the probability of heavy rainfall events method 2 first the maximum 9 h rainfall was derived from each pgw simulation second a frequency distribution was estimated for the maximum 9 h rainfall fig 5 a third the cumulative distribution of the maximum 9 h rainfall and its fitted curve cumulative distribution curve were estimated fig 5b using the cumulative distribution curve a weight w2 was calculated then the potential inundation risk based on the cumulative distribution curve rp c was calculated as follows 13 r p c i 1 n i i 1 c i i 1 n i i w 2 i where ci is the cumulative probability value for the i th rainfall event i is the number in the first column of table 6 w2 was larger for smaller rainfall events with shorter return periods fig 5c the pgw method projects possible future heavy rainfall based on past extreme events the frequency distribution of the target rainfall scenario from pgw simulations fig 5a indicated possible variations in heavy rainfall events in the future by combining the pgw method and the ensemble simulation technique uncertainties in future climate were also considered in method 2 the estimation of w2 was interpreted as a variant of the past maximum method case for assessment of future climatic conditions both rp e and rp c were normalized between 0 0 and 1 0 to assess the relative risk distribution within the target area 3 results of simulations 3 1 results of numerical weather simulations fig 6 shows the spatial distribution of the observed and simulated total rainfall from july 28 30 2013 around the kakehashi river basin all results of the wrf simulations are ensemble means the hindcasting results showed heavy rainfall in the areas east and south of the kakehashi river basin similar to the observed rainfall in the rap data the heavy rainfall area over the ocean the northwestern part of the domain was wider in the hindcasting results than in the rap results there were some differences between the hindcasting and rap results but the wrf simulation well reproduced the heavy rainfall in 2013 the results of pgw 1 pgw 2 and pgw 4 were similar to those of the hindcast in pgw 3 the ensemble mean total rainfall around the kakehashi river basin was lower than that from the hindcast in pgw 5 a notable increase in total rainfall was found over wide area the results of the pgw simulations indicated that at least for the ensemble mean values the total amount of rainfall does not necessarily increase with climate change the hindcasting results for heavy rainfall events in 1998 and 2004 also reflected the observed rainfall distribution and showed various changes in the ensemble mean total rainfall with climate change see figs s2 and s3 in supplementary information fig 7 shows the basin mean total rainfall and the mean maximum hourly rainfall in the wrf simulations for 1998 the hindcast basin mean total rainfall r t ranged from 135 to 206 mm and the ensemble mean value was 157 mm fig 7a and table 7 while the observed basin mean total rainfall was 145 mm therefore the hindcast r t was slightly overestimated the r t values from the pgw ranged widely i e from 18 to 305 mm in pgw 2 the r t values were substantially lower than those of the hindcast whereas the results for pgw 3 and pgw 4 were close to the hindcast results the mean r t values for pgw 1 and pgw 5 were higher in comparison with the hindcast for four of the five pgw runs the maximum r t value was higher than that for the hindcast table 7 the basin mean maximum hourly rainfall r h of 36 49 mm h for the hindcast fig 7a is comparable with the results for pgw 3 and pgw 5 but higher than the values for pgw 2 and pgw 4 pgw 1 showed clear intensification of r h as with r t only two pgw runs showed ensemble mean r h values higher than the hindcast values however the maximum r h value for each of the pgw runs was higher than that of the hindcast table 7 these results indicate that although average heavy rainfall could remain the same extreme rainfall events could become more intense in the future in the case of 2004 ensemble spreads of r t and r h were small in the hindcast pgw 1 pgw 3 and pgw 4 fig 7b it is thought that the differences between the first three members of the lsp method i e x1 x2 and x3 were small in these ensemble simulations the r t and r h values for pgw 3 and pgw 4 were clearly smaller than those of the hindcast the results of pgw 1 were comparable with those of the hindcast fig 7b but the ensemble mean and maximum r t and r h values were higher than the those of the hindcast table 7 although the ensemble mean r t and r h values of pgw 2 were lower than those of the hindcast in 1998 they were larger in 2004 many members of pgw 2 showed higher r t and r h values than the hindcast these results indicate the various effects of climate change on heavy rainfall events even within small areas the results of pgw 5 showed an increasing trend in both r t and r h for 2013 the r t and r h values ranged widely but the results indicated intensification of heavy rainfall events in the future in particular the r h values for all pgw simulations showed that both the ensemble mean and the maximum values were larger than those of the hindcast table 7 results for 1998 and 2013 indicated a high possibility of intensification of short duration heavy rainfall events such variations would cause more severe flooding in the future fig 7 and table 7 show that rainfall characteristics are likely to change in the future they also highlight the complexity of the effects of climate change on heavy rainfall events it is difficult to estimate future variations in heavy rainfall events based on a specific heavy rainfall event and a specific pgw simulation result therefore all the members of the five pgw ensemble simulations were assumed to be one set of samples to estimate the frequency distribution of future heavy rainfall 3 2 results of runoff analyses and inundation simulations as stated in section 2 4 three pgw simulations were selected to generate boundary conditions for runoff analyses and those results were stretched to create the target rainfall scenarios fig 8 shows parts of the temporal variations in the basin mean rainfall estimated for each return period the maximum hourly rainfall was 67 7 mm h at r260 in case 2 fig 8b the record maximum hourly rainfall in komatsu was 65 mm recorded in 2012 thus the future rainfall shown in fig 8 is considered possible fig 9 shows river discharge at haneda station for several target rainfall scenarios in the three simulations cases 1 3 the peak rain rate for the same rainfall scenario was highest in case 2 fig 8 but the maximum discharge for the same rainfall scenario was highest in case 1 overflow sections are listed in table 8 in case 1 flooding from r190 or rainfall of 190 mm 9h exceeded the designed water level at section 24 however in cases 2 and 3 there was no overflow of the kakehashi river with r190 even with the same rainfall scenario the maximum discharge differed among the cases fig 9 because of different rainfall patterns fig 8 for other rainfall scenarios some differences were observed in the overflow sections using the overflow information levee breaching simulations were implemented for each rainfall scenario and overflow section fig 10 shows composites of the maximum inundation depth for each rainfall scenario in the case of both r190 and r197 the inundation area spread on the left bank of the kakehashi river at sections 20 and 24 the flood flow did not spread out on the right bank when the discharge amount was low because of the surrounding topographic features in the case of r202 inundation areas were seen on both sides of the kakehashi river wider inundation areas and greater inundation depths were found with higher rainfall scenarios 4 evaluation of potential inundation risk fig 11 a shows the frequency distribution of the maximum 9 h rainfall for the kakehashi river basin derived from the pgw ensemble simulations the results reflect the future occurrence probability of each rainfall scenario under atmospheric conditions similar to those for the heavy rainfall events in 1998 2004 and 2013 the occurrence frequency indicates that even a rainfall scenario with a 43 000 year return period 260 mm 9h could occur by the end of the 21st century such a rainfall scenario will no longer be rare under future climatic conditions and rainfall events with very long return periods e g longer than 1 000 years under past and present climatic conditions should be considered in future risk evaluations based on the frequency distribution in fig 11a the weighting for each return period w2 was calculated see section 2 5 fig 11b shows the cumulative probability density derived from the occurrence frequency presented in fig 11a a fitted curve is also shown in fig 11b the fitted curve is the value of the cumulative distribution function ci with the assumption of a normal distribution as described in section 2 5 the weight for the i th return period w2 i was defined as w2 i 1 ci the value of w2 for weak rainfall was large and the value of w2 for extreme heavy rainfall was small fig 12 shows the spatial distribution of rp estimated using the two methods described previously the results in fig 12 are standardized from 0 to 1 here rp e was estimated using method 1 with w1 occurrence probability and calculated as the expectation of the maximum inundation depth the spatial distribution of higher risk areas rp e 0 1 is similar to that of the maximum inundation depth for r190 fig 10a areas where inundation occurred only as a result of rainfall with longer return periods were classified as low risk the occurrence probability of rainfall events with a longer return period was not low fig 11a for example a rainfall scenario of 240 mm 9h return period of approximately 15 000 years was projected to occur frequently by the end of the 21st century the effects of extreme rainfalls e g 240 mm 9h could be negligibly underestimated by method 1 and the future inundation risk in the low risk area in fig 12a might not be as low as estimated the potential inundation risk rp c calculated using method 2 with w2 is shown in fig 12b it can be seen that rp c values of 0 1 spread over a wide area on both sides of the kakehashi river simultaneously the spatial distribution of areas with rp c values of 0 1 was not similar to any of the results shown in fig 10 areas flooded by 1 000 year return period rainfall were at greater risk fig 12b moreover the area with inundation depth of 1 m light blue in fig 10 was also classified as higher risk areas with rare and large inundation depths 1 0 m and areas with frequent and small inundation depths were evaluated as high risk areas as seen in fig 11 extreme rainfall e g 230 mm 9h with a return period of 9 000 years in the present climate will not be rare in the future the weights used in methods 1 and 2 are shown in table 9 compared with w2 the difference between w1 for r190 and other rainfall scenarios was very large method 1 might underestimate the effects of larger rainfall scenarios and thus it is unsuitable for future flood assessment method 2 is more suitable because the nonstationarity or variations in occurrence frequency of extreme heavy rainfall events in the future is properly considered 5 discussion 5 1 estimation of future rainfall an ensemble simulation technique has the advantage of increasing the number of samples and of considering a wide variety of rainfall patterns that might occur under certain global warming conditions numerical weather prediction models are not perfect and have various sources of uncertainty however by applying an ensemble pgw simulation technique it is possible to estimate the rainfall that could occur under atmospheric conditions likely to produce heavy rainfall events under the effects of climate change the pgw simulation results for individual heavy rainfall events show that for the heavy rainfall event that occurred in 2013 the total and the maximum hourly rainfall will be larger in the future for most of the five global warming projection results considered in this study however complex behaviors were also observed regarding future variations in heavy rainfall for example pgw 3 tended to produce smaller total and maximum rainfall than that of the hindcast and the other pgws for the 1998 event but tended to produce the largest rainfall for the 2004 event these results suggest that even a single gcm can produce different tendencies of future variations depending on rainfall events if the effects of global warming are different for each rainfall type estimating future rainfall using statistical methods might prove difficult while it is convenient to estimate the average heavy rainfall trend from future projections using a gcm some types of rainfalls that show trends of variation different to the average variation might be missed in addition to understanding the average tendency of future variation in heavy rainfall it is also necessary to investigate whether there are differences in the variation tendencies depending on the cause and location of the rainfall a pgw dynamic downscaling approach has the advantage of representing localized heavy rainfall but with a heavy computational load moreover the computational load increases with implementation of ensemble simulations and use of global warming projection results from multiple gcms and multiple greenhouse gas emission scenarios while ensemble pgw dynamic downscaling has multiple advantages e g examining differences in the effects of global warming for individual weather events and obtaining a large number of samples for probabilistic assessments it might not be realistic for performing a large number of simulations for individual river basins to conduct future risk assessments for various river basins it will be indispensable to develop a fast and simple rainfall estimation method that does not compromise the advantages of ensemble pgw dynamic downscaling in this study the results of pgw simulations based on multiple gcms were considered as one sample however there are differences in the reproducibility of the present climate by each gcm and there are also differences in the reliability of future projections therefore it is also necessary to develop a method for utilizing rainfall information that considers the reliability of each gcm when used in an ensemble of multiple gcms additionally it is also important to update information on future variations in heavy rainfall using the latest global warming projections it is expected that use of reliable gcms and the latest global warming projection will enable estimation of the appropriate range of uncertainty or future variations of heavy rainfall 5 2 evaluation of potential inundation risk as shown in fig 10 inundation conditions vary greatly depending on the magnitude of the heavy rainfall on the left bank of the kakehashi river there are areas inundated to the depth of 0 3 m with the rainfall of r190 and to the depth of 0 5 1 m with the rainfall of r260 the right bank of the kakehashi river is not inundated by rainfall such as that of r190 and r197 however these areas are inundated to the depth of 1 2 m by the rainfall of r260 therefore it is important to determine how best to evaluate risk in areas with high frequency and little inundation and in areas with low frequency and substantial inundation in this study a new flood risk assessment method was developed that considers future variations in rainfall characteristics it is essential to consider the uncertainty of climate change in assessment of future flood risk and necessary to introduce statistical assessment methods however there are several disadvantages to assessing flood risks as an expected value based on occurrence probabilities as shown in fig 12a the use of occurrence probabilities based on past observations might underestimate the risk of extreme rainfall events that might occur in the future such underestimation could be avoided if the appropriate occurrence probability under the effects of climate change could be estimated however this is unlikely to be possible first it is difficult to implement long term high resolution simulations to obtain future rainfall information as stated in section 5 1 second the probability of heavy rainfall might be nonstationary under global warming and it might be inappropriate to extend the time period to obtain a large number of samples for example if the climatic conditions in the 2070 s and 2090 s are different it would be inappropriate to group the years 2070 2100 into a single target period to obtain a large sample of extreme events that could occur over a relatively short period ensemble pgw simulation with climate anomalies for the period of interest could prove effective if the time period for creating an anomaly is short it might not be possible to estimate the rainfall for a particular return period in this sense the proposed method utilizing the occurrence frequency and its cumulative probability method 2 is useful for future flood risk assessment selection of an optimal probability distribution function is necessary to calculate the occurrence probability for multiple return periods method 1 but method 2 does not require a probability distribution function which has the advantage of simplifying the evaluation procedure however there are some points to be considered in relation to method 2 for example all results obtained from the pgw ensemble simulations were used to estimate the cumulative probability including cases with 9 h rainfall of 20 or 30 mm fig 11 rainfall of this magnitude can occur annually e g the minimum annual maximum daily precipitation in komatsu during 1978 2021 was 43 mm and is unlikely to cause a disaster further study will be required to determine the lower limit of rainfall necessary to estimate a cumulative probability curve it is also interesting to examine whether a small number of samples could be used to estimate an appropriate cumulative distribution function this study did not consider the effects of internal water flooding inundation conditions can vary depending on internal flooding because sewage systems generally have a lower safety level than rivers inundation due to inland waterlogging is more likely to occur in a situation where a levee breach occurs on the main river there is high possibility of internal waterlogging and the depth of flooding tend to be larger taniguchi and shibuo 2018 kitamura et al 2021 for a more realistic assessment of flood risk it is necessary to consider the simultaneous occurrence of internal flooding and river flooding the rainfall intensity that causes internal water logging can also determine the lower rainfall limit of the cumulative distribution used in method 2 when considering internal water logging an appropriate drainage model is essential since the simple drainage model in this study drains water instantaneously there is a possibility that the inundation depth and inundation area may be underestimated or the inundation duration may be calculated short the timing of inflow into the river by the drainage pump may also be earlier which may make it easier for river water levels to rise and shorten the duration of floods it is also a future task to improve the simple drainage model such as expressing delays in drainage method 2 can identify high risk areas both those with low frequency of severe inundation and those with high frequency of light inundation however the measures required in the two areas will differ and it is matter of discussion to determine which should be prioritized using method 2 to evaluate economic losses it might be possible to generate information that contributes to the selection of areas where flood control measures should be implemented as a priority 6 conclusions uncertainties in future climate projections should be considered in both hazard estimations and risk analyses in this study several possible extreme future rainfall scenarios were estimated using pgw ensemble simulations for the kakehashi river in japan potential inundation risks were calculated using the probability of future precipitation events and simulated inundation depths the pgw ensemble simulations were applied to three heavy rainfall events in the kakehashi river basin using future projections based on the rcp8 5 emissions scenario even though the ensemble mean values of total rainfall and maximum hourly rainfall were similar between the hindcast and the pgw simulations the maximum values or extreme rainfalls tended to be higher under future climatic conditions future increases were more significant for maximum hourly rainfall than for total rainfall during the target period frequency analysis of the 9 h rainfall which is used for flood prevention planning in the kakehashi river basin showed that heavy rainfall events with very long return periods 1 000 years in the present climate could occur more frequently as the climate changes indicating high probability of flood intensification in the future based on the inundation simulation results for multiple rainfall scenarios potential inundation risks were calculated using two methods in method 1 the potential inundation risk rp e was calculated as an expectation value using the occurrence probabilities of rainfall and the maximum inundation depths for multiple return periods in this method the areas where inundation occurred only with longer return period rainfall were evaluated as low risk areas in method 2 a cumulative probability function derived from the frequency of 9 h rainfall scenarios from the pgw ensemble simulations were used to calculate the potential inundation risk rp c the rp c indicated that both areas with high frequency low inundation depths and those with low frequency high inundation depths were evaluated as areas of higher risk in method 1 the occurrence probabilities were estimated from past observations in this case the effects of extreme rainfall events which are likely to occur more frequently in the future might be underestimated as shown in this study heavy rainfall events with return periods of 1 000 years might occur more often to consider such possibilities future risks should be assessed based on future precipitation scenarios the cumulative probability function used in method 2 was based on the results of the pgw ensemble simulations future inundation risks were assessed based on future stochastic information and were independent of past and present stochastic features this study highlighted the possibility of intensification of heavy rainfall in the future in particular it is important that even heavy rainfall events that are currently extremely rare might occur more frequently in the future future flood risks might be underestimated if only current and past rainfall data are used and thus flood risk assessments should incorporate future variability in rainfall events for that purpose the pgw ensemble simulation is very useful for modeling possible future rainfall this study also proposed a new method method 2 for evaluating future potential inundation risk independently of present rainfall patterns although further improvement is possible the method provides a basic framework for future flood risk evaluation ensemble numerical simulations can produce many samples but the computational needs are great in the future it will be necessary to develop a downscaling method that can physically represent future climate change with a smaller computational load accurate simulation results with various rainfall inputs are indispensable for reliable risk assessment in runoff analysis some rainfall events reduced the accuracy of the simulation improvement and optimization of the rri model is also an important issue for realistic risk assessment inland waterlogging should also be considered for that purpose it will be essential to develop a method for determining appropriate spatial and temporal patterns of input rainfall for flood risk assessment credit authorship

2873,maize is one of the major crops in china the soil water content swc in the root zone of maize is a critical indicator that guides agricultural production decisions and can affect national food security however a daily scale high precision spatial estimation method for swc in china s main maize producing areas has not been well researched therefore we developed a spatial estimation model for swc with a dynamic parameter optimization mechanism termed tpe catboost it combines the catboost algorithm as the core fitting framework with the efficient tree structured parzen estimator tpe algorithm to achieve a dynamic hyperparameter optimization based on covariate characteristics daily measured multi depth swc data at 175 stations from 2015 to 2019 were used as the reference truth and 18 items of information including soil physical and chemical properties daily meteorological conditions and spatial location information were obtained from google earth engine and considered as covariates model training was performed using the leave one out cross validation method estimation error differences were investigated in four dimensions time space depth and the model our key results are as follows 1 by combining all covariates the highest estimation accuracy could be obtained at any soil depth with a mean absolute error mae within 6 06 6 94 the top five mean importance scores of covariates were latitude soil ph bulk density dem and dewpoint temperature 2 the mae for all years remained within 4 66 9 34 with higher errors in june 3 the mae for each province remained within 3 5

intelligence ai algorithms combining environmental covariates xgboost catboost and tpe catboost could achieve better estimation accuracy in particular tpe catboost performed well with an improvement of 15 1 over ebk we also demonstrated that tpe catboost was susceptible to changes in the covariate gain capacity under extreme weather conditions using the shapley additive explanation shap algorithm

tanumihardjo et al 2020 its production is therefore crucial for global food security the rapid increase in population climate change and geopolitical frictions are driving international efforts to ensure efficient food production prosekov and ivanova 2018 as china s primary crop maize is sown on more than 43 33 million ha and yielded over 272 55 million tons in 2021 china national bureau of statistics n d soil water content swc is an essential environmental indicator that summarizes the complex interactions of the atmosphere hydrosphere and biosphere jiang et al 2022 an appropriate value of swc is critical for ensuring water uptake and photosynthesis for material accumulation in maize li et al 2022 maize yield is strongly related to the swc rigden et al 2020 song et al 2019 observed that soil water stress decreased the leaf area index lai and biomass and triggered irrecoverable yield losses peichl et al 2018 further demonstrated that soil moisture abnormalities could reduce maize yields by over 10 maintaining the swc in the root zone of maize within the appropriate range through effective agronomic measures and irrigation control is a meaningful way to promote healthy growth and increase grain yield togneri et al 2022 therefore to ensure national food security and an adequate supply of agricultural products it is necessary to determine the swc in the root zone of maize accurately for point scale swc monitoring the swc is typically converted using the soil drying method by calculating the weight of the water lost upon drying although the soil drying method can achieve high accuracy it is invasive as it destroys the soil sample its spatial representativeness is poor owing to the limited number of pieces that can be analyzed and the results are only available after a significant delay rowe 2018 with the development of sensor technology in situ swc determination methods have been developed such as frequency domain reflectometry fdr and time domain reflectometry tdr techniques these methods can provide data with high temporal frequency and accuracy furthermore multi depth swc profiles can be obtained based on the dielectric coefficient of the soil s u et al 2014 however the swc values measured using sensors are generally average for 10 cm radius cylinders around the sensors therefore inferring swc values over larger areas remains challenging however a large scale estimation of the swc distribution in the root zone of main maize producing regions is crucial for guiding irrigation decision making and yield prediction d wu et al 2019 therefore we argue that a large scale swc estimation study is urgently needed to help understand the overall environmental conditions of maize cultivation and guide decision making remote sensing detection technology can meet the need for large scale earth observations using remote sensing data acquisitions the swc has been characterized via products such as the soil moisture active passive smap aquarius stopped because of technical failure on june 8 2015 and the soil moisture and ocean salinity smos bao et al 2019 smap is currently the most suitable remote sensing product for swc colliander et al 2022 xiaoyi wang et al 2021 fuentes et al 2022 further improved the accuracy of smap in australia using a data fusion approach however the level 4 soil moisture product for mass application was released at a frequency of 7 days and a resolution of 9 km furthermore smap is only sensitive to moisture changes in the top layer of the soil 0 5 cm depth and is susceptible to surface roughness colliander et al 2017 posing challenges in providing feedback on the actual moisture conditions at different soil depths in the maize root zone the low return period and detection depth make it difficult for remote sensing swc products to accommodate the planting production needs of precision agriculture mulla 2013 therefore combining existing technological developments and shortcomings to carry out the spatial estimation of swc with the advantages of real time in situ monitoring timeliness and scalability of detection depth is a necessary means to meet the actual agricultural production requirements traditional gis spatial interpolation algorithms such as the inverse distance weighted idw and kriging algorithm are the classical geostatistical methods to produce spatial estimations based on the first law of geography goodchild 2009 however spatial prediction techniques based on the first law of geography or statistical principles only consider the variability in spatial distances they have two essential requirements a sufficient number of samples to characterize the relationships across the study area effectively and the smoothness of the extracted relationships zhu et al 2018 therefore considering that the traditional spatial interpolation method requires a large sample size and does not consider the crucial influence of the environment on the swc it is difficult to obtain high spatial estimation accuracy shen et al 2019 the third law of geography states that the more similar the geographic configuration of the target points the more similar the values of the target variables zhu et al 2018 therefore integrating environmental covariates such as soil properties and meteorological parameters to carry out a spatial estimation of swc is a novel research perspective research shows that adding covariates can effectively improve the estimation accuracy of a model chen et al 2022 yu et al 2021 yu et al 2020a soil parameters such as the soil ph and soil bulk density showed a high correlation with the soil water storage capacity ghazali et al 2020 yang et al 2016 meteorological parameters directly drove soil moisture changes through evapotranspiration precipitation and other moisture cycle transport processes agam and berliner 2006 sun et al 2019 hence combining soil and meteorological covariates can better characterize the spatial distribution of swc digital soil mapping dsm technology is a novel solution to evaluate difficult to measure soil parameters by combining environmental parameters with efficient algorithms for spatial estimation wadoux et al 2020 chen et al 2022 highlighted an exponential growth in recent years by reviewing 244 studies concerning dsm however most of these studies have focused on estimating soil organic carbon and particle size fractions in small areas few studies have been conducted for the spatial estimation of swc over large areas and multiple soil depths thus there is an urgent need to explore synergistic modeling of multiple environmental covariates to improve the accuracy of swc spatial estimation efficient and one stop access to multi source remote sensing and its derived data presents challenges for scientific research tamiminia et al 2020 in this respect google earth engine gee allows online visualization and computational analysis processing of large amounts of global scale geoscientific information especially satellite image data gorelick et al 2017 gee platform enables rapid batch data acquisition processing computation and analysis saving considerable time venkatappa et al 2021 thus far gee has been widely used in hydrological studies land cover land use classification urban planning natural hazards climate analysis and image processing amani et al 2020 therefore a significant advantage is utilizing the gee platform to obtain synoptic estimation factors such as soil meteorology and topography for swc monitoring stations the rapid development of machine learning artificial intelligence ai algorithms has effectively improved the ability of dsm to fit complex nonlinear relationships chen et al 2022 with the development of ai technology algorithms derived from deep neural networks dnn and decision tree theory have given rise to two dominant ai algorithm classes hateffard et al 2019 dnn models such as deep learning have become popular owing to their highly accurate fitting ability however they usually require a longer training time and a large amount of training data therefore they are unsuitable for swc spatial estimation lin 2020 in contrast the decision tree based approach can be used to efficiently processes massive amounts of data through three steps feature selection decision tree generation and decision tree pruning to achieve an efficient and accurate fitting performance intuitively obtain a feature importance ranking and facilitate the selection of collaborative mapping parameters mienye et al 2019 with ensemble learning el as the theoretical foundation decision tree based models have developed into classical model algorithms such as random forest gradient boosting decision tree gbdt and extreme gradient boosting xgboost by constructing and combining multiple learners to complete the learning task and obtain more accurate stable and robust final results polikar 2012 based on the classical algorithm yandex released the catboost model framework based on the improved gbdt algorithm in 2018 prokhorenkova et al 2018 catboost solved the problem of gradient bias and estimation bias that often occurred in earlier machine learning algorithms based on the gbdt framework thus reducing the occurrence of overfitting and improving the generalization ability of the algorithm in hydrology the catboost based models have been used to estimate reference evapotranspiration et0 showing significant advantages in estimation accuracy and fitting efficiency huang et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 however recent studies on the spatial estimation of swc still used traditional regression algorithms such as random forest fathololoumi et al 2021 regression trees zeraatpisheh et al 2019 and multiple linear regression fathololoumi et al 2020 thus there is an urgent need to apply more advanced ai algorithms to achieve high accuracy swc spatial estimation studies have been conducted to apply the catboost model as a core model for agricultural water resources cisty and cyprich 2020 reported that catboost has a significant accuracy advantage over multiple linear regression methods for fitting swc change processes in western slovakia huang et al 2019 and zhang et al 2020 obtained similar positive conclusions in studies that targeted soil evapotranspiration estimation hyperparameter optimization is the core step of automatic machine learning modeling it significantly impacts the model fitting accuracy stuke et al 2021 commonly used hyperparameter optimization methods include grid search random search swarm intelligence and bayesian optimization algorithms grid search is an exhaustive search applied to a low dimensional parameter search space ghawi and pfeffer 2019 the random search uses a random jumping strategy in the hyperparameter combination selection process which significantly improves the search speed but is equally prone to falling into local optimal solutions because of the uncertainty of random search sampling li and talwalkar 2020 the swarm intelligence algorithm is complex and computationally intensive for modeling noh et al 2020 the bayesian optimization algorithm which adjusts the hyperparameters by approximating the posterior distribution of the unknown function through prior knowledge appears to be more approximate than traditional optimization algorithms stuke et al 2021 this algorithm significantly improves the efficiency of hyperparameter sampling while also successfully obtaining the globally optimal solution bayesian optimization for machine learning tuning was first proposed by snoek et al 2012 to update the posterior distribution of the objective function by continuously adding sample points given the optimized objective function as a variant of the outstanding performance of bayesian algorithms the tree structured parzen estimator tpe was constructed based on the sequential model based optimization smbo method which utilizes kernel density estimation kde to generate the proxy model the tpe has an excellent global exploration ability and does not easily fall into a local optimum hence it is more suitable for swc data characterized by high spatial and temporal variability researchers have achieved good performance by utilizing the tpe to optimize machine learning models vassallo et al 2021 constructed a tpe optimized xgboost aml model and demonstrated that the method outperformed the current preferred random forest algorithm and reduced the impact of concept drift shen et al 2022 used tpe to optimize the natural gradient boosting model hyperparameters for runoff probability estimation and the model performance improved in all metrics of deterministic estimation compared to the baseline model therefore by integrating the catboost model with the excellent global optimization seeking ability of the tpe algorithm we constructed a tpe catboost soil moisture spatial estimation model using the tpe algorithm to optimize the critical hyperparameters of catboost daily and multi depth soil volumetric water content data from 2015 to 2019 in the main maize producing areas of china were used as the reference truth the soil physical and chemical properties daily meteorological and spatial location data in the study area were obtained from gee model training and evaluation were performed using the leave one out cross validation loocv method the study s main objective was to investigate a novel dynamic adaptive ai method for daily swc spatial estimation in maize production areas and verify its accuracy 2 study area we focused on the main maize production areas in china 28 58 11 53 34 10 n 97 12 32 134 53 57 e identified based on maize production sown area and monitoring stations these areas included the heilongjiang jilin inner mongolia autonomous region beijing tianjin hebei shanxi henan anhui jiangsu and hubei provinces fig 1 according to a report published by the national bureau of statistics of china this area featured an average annual maize cultivation area of over 26 53 million ha and an average annual production of over 160 million tons from 2015 to 2019 making it the core maize production base of china the region s total area is approximately 2 81 million km2 covering a vast territory with complex meteorological and topographical conditions the study area covers cold temperate humid and semi humid climates from north to south creating a significant challenge to achieving accurate spatial estimation the primary planting time of maize in the study area spans from march to october during which the northern permafrost thaws and sensors installed at different depths can determine accurate swc values 3 data acquisition and analysis 3 1 data

svwc20 30 cm svwc30 40 cm svwc40 and 50 cm svwc50 from 2015 to 2019 three types of remote sensing auxiliary data namely multi depth soil physical and chemical properties daily multi parameter meteorology and digital elevation model dem were obtained from gee gorelick et al 2017 benefiting from gee s enormous data resources and online integrated development environment ide we utilized python language in gee code editor to extract and export site properties the data were exported to google drive in csv format for storage and downloading to local devices tamiminia et al 2020 the data obtained from the gee platform were as follows 1 soil physicochemical property data were obtained from the dataset provided by envirometrix ltd for 2018 this dataset contained soil field capacity swc

six standard depths 0 10 30 60 100 and 200 cm at a resolution of 250 m 2 daily meteorological data relied on era5 daily aggregates i e the latest climate reanalysis produced by the ecmwf copernicus climate change service hersbach et al 2020 era5 is the fifth generation ecmwf atmospheric reanalysis of the global climate era5 daily provides aggregated values for each day for seven era5 climate reanalysis parameters 2 m air temperature 2 m dewpoint temperature total precipitation mean sea level pressure surface pressure 10 m u component of wind and 10 m v component of wind 3 spatial location data were composed of longitude latitude and elevation longitude and latitude were derived from the coordinates under the wgs84 spatial geographic coordinate system the elevation data were built using the multi error resolved improved terrain dem yamazaki et al 2017 the data were processed by removing several error components absolute bias streak noise speckle noise and tree height bias from existing satellite based dems srtm3 v2 1 and aw3d 30 m v1 representing topographic elevations at 3 s resolution approximately 90 m at the equator and covering the land area within 90 n 60s referenced to the egm96 geoid table 1 lists all the metrics with name units resolution value summary dataset provider and gee data acquisition code 3 2 data processing and analysis raw swc monitoring data were collected at a frequency of 1 h and converted to daily data by averaging the daily values for different soil depths some soil property data from gee were of integer type sbd socc and sph they needed to be converted according to the scale of the data source to recover their valid values moreover for ease of interpretation and understanding we converted the raw meteorological data from k to c for temperature pa to hpa for surface sea level pressure and m to mm for total daily precipitation considering the difficulty in achieving consistency in soil depths between the data provided by the different data sources we selected the nearest depth for matching we matched svwc10 to the 0 cm depth svwc20 to the 10 cm depth svwc30 and svwc40 to the 30 cm depth and svwc50 to the 60 cm soil depth data fig 2 shows the daily average swc evolution of the soil profiles in the study area at the time series level with the average swc within 15 1 29 7 the swc fluctuations are more intense and the average swc is lower at 10 cm soil depth compared to deeper soils table 2 presents the units mean standard deviation sd maximum minimum and median values for different swc depths soil physicochemical properties geographical location and meteorological data fig 3 shows the correlation coefficients between swc and covariates pearson s correlation coefficient was used to accurately evaluate the degree of linear correlation between two continuous variables jebli et al 2021 pearson s correlation coefficient p was defined as follows 1 p i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where x i and y i were the characteristic variables x and y were the means of n data p took values in the range 1 1 and positive and negative values of p indicated that the two variables are positively and negatively correlated with each other respectively fig 3 illustrates pearson s correlation coefficients between multi depth swc data and covariates overall the correlation between soil physicochemical properties and swc was high within 0 53 0 45 for sand content 0 42 0 48 for clay content 0 46 0 36 for soil ph and 0 26 0 37 for fc the correlation coefficients for the dem were within 0 39 0 51 correlation coefficients for lat were within 0 35 0 40 which were significantly higher than those for lng 4 methodology based on past research progress we constructed an swc spatial estimation model tpe catboost to optimize hyperparameters at the daily scale automatically fig 4 in particular 1 the gee platform was utilized to obtain soil meteorological and topographic covariate data 2 catboost was utilized as the base fitting algorithm for soil meteorological and location covariates 3 the tpe algorithm was combined to search for the optimal combination of hyperparameters based on data characteristics and 4 the loocv method was utilized to maximize the model s generalization estimation capability and develop an autonomous optimization model for swc estimation 4 1 catboost we estimated the spatial swc with 18 environmental covariates sph socc sbd fc sc cc tmean tmin tmax tdew ptotal sp slp wu wv dem lng and lat which posed a severe challenge to the model s ability to perform complex nonlinear regressions catboost is a gradient boosting decision tree based machine learning framework that enhances and improves the gbdt algorithm zhang et al 2020 significantly improving multivariate fitting ability unlike the traditional gbdt catboost has a unique processing flow for categorical features all samples are randomly sorted subsequently a value is obtained for one of the category type features each instance with that feature converted to a numeric type takes a mean value based on the category label ranked before that sample priority and weighting factors are added to generate a new numeric variable this approach reduces the noise associated with low frequency multi environment covariate features the estimation for swc was treated as a regression problem therefore the catboost calculation priority was obtained by averaging the label values assuming a ranking of σ 1 2 n then x σ p k could be replaced by 2 x σ p k j 1 p 1 x σ j k x σ p k y σ j a p j 1 p 1 x σ j k x σ p k a where a was a weighting factor greater than 0 and p was an added a priori term although combining soil meteorological and spatial location covariates often led to new feature types for higher estimation accuracy catboost enabled the ability to combine new features in constructing tree structures when building a new tree catboost used greedy methods to consider combinations and construct the choice of split points no combinations were considered when the tree was split for the first time when the next split was performed all combinations of the current tree and category based features were combined with all category based features in the dataset the algorithm dynamically converted the new varieties of category based features into numerical features the pseudo code process is shown in table 3 the swc spatial estimation model s generalization ability is crucial to the application s performance catboost improves the model generalization ability by replacing the gradient estimation method in the traditional algorithm with an ordered boosting which mitigates the bias of gradient estimation to obtain an unbiased gradient estimate catboost trained a separate model m i for each sample x i model m i was obtained by using a training set that does not contain a sample x i m i was used to obtain a gradient estimate of the samples which was used to train the base learner and obtain the final model the ordered boosting algorithm could be written in pseudo code as shown in table 4 4 2 tree structured parzen estimator optimization algorithms could help catboost select the optimal hyperparameters during training and improve the swc spatial estimation accuracy the bayesian optimization algorithms belonged to the high performance global optimization algorithms the optimization process utilized bayes theorem to fit the objective function using a probabilistic proxy model and selected the next evaluation point based on the results of the prior sampling to quickly reach the optimal solution which could be expressed as 3 p f h i p h i f p f p h i 4 h i x 1 f x 1 x i f x i where p f and p h i f were the prior probability distribution and likelihood distribution of f respectively p f h i denoted the parameter f conditional probability distribution when the ensemble of observations h i had been given as the posterior probability distribution the tpe algorithm utilized in this study as a probabilistic proxy model defined p h i f in eq 3 as 5 p x y l x i f y y g x i f y y where y m i n x 1 f x 1 x i f x i denoted the optimal value of the observation threshold l x was the density estimate of the loss function of observation x less than y and g x denoted the density estimate of the loss function of the observation x greater than or equal to y tpe utilized the expected improvement expected improvement ei as the sampling function to select the next evaluation point that had an optimal effect on the objective function value 6 e i y x y y y p y x d y y y y p x y p y p x d y when p y x integrated positively at y y setting the hyperparameter x for algorithmic modeling would produce better results than the optimal value on the observation threshold let γ p y y and constructed eq 7 and eq 8 as 7 p x r p xy p y d y γ l x 1 γ g x 8 y y y p x y p y d y γ y l x l x y p y d y substituting into eq 6 yields eq 9 9 ei y x γ y l x l x y p y d y γ l x 1 γ g x γ g x l x 1 γ 1 equation 9 showed that the maximum ei value was obtained when the hyperparameter had the maximum probability l x and minimum probability g x through tpe the sample hyperparameter ensemble was constructed by l x and g x evaluating in the form of l x g x during each iteration the algorithm returned the point x with the maximum ei value 4 3 tpe catboost the tpe algorithm was used to dynamically optimize the hyperparameters of the catboost model based on daily multi covariate features to achieve the optimal fitting accuracy for the swc spatial dataset the process of hyperparameter optimization could be expressed as 10 x arg min x χ f x where f x represented the objective function of catboost and x was the parameter when f x achieved the most significant results in contrast to other optimization methods automatic hyperparameter tuning for tpe could be achieved by developing knowledge of the relationship between the hyperparameter values and model performance in turn a priori knowledge was used to make inferences about the choice of the next set of hyperparameters thus the number of trials could be minimized and the experimental efficiency increased when determining the optimal combination of hyperparameter values the number of iterations of the tpe was set to 200 details of the catboost hyperparameters are listed in table 5 iterations learning rate and depth parameters had a crucial influence on the ability to fit the catboost model bentéjac et al 2021 therefore we performed a dynamic optimization search for these three parameters the tpe catboost algorithm was executed according to the following instructions 1 import the raw data of each monitoring point in the study area on a particular day set the catboost hyperparameter range and generate a random set of initialized parameter combinations 2 perform tpe probability density estimation to calculate ei values using the sampling function select the following parameter combination to be evaluated based on the ei values sampled in the previous sequence 3 input the parameter combination with the maximum ei value into the catboost estimation model for training and output the model estimation results under the current hyperparameters 4 repeat step 2 according to the number of iterations of the tpe correct the sampling function and select the parameter combination corresponding to the most incredible accuracy among them as the hyperparameter configuration of the model for swc space estimation 4 4 cross validation and evaluation criteria considering the sparse distribution of swc monitoring stations in the main maize producing areas we utilized the loocv method to evaluate the generalization fit accuracy of the model to explore better the relationship between multi depth moisture data and synergistic factors loocv was a particular form of the k fold cross validation method which could be considered the n fold cross validation when k was equal to the n fold cross validation when the sample size n it meant that one data sample at a time was taken as the only element of the test set and all the remaining n 1 data points were the corresponding training set n iterations were needed for each round of training and the average error of all iterations was calculated to assess the model s hyperparameters and generalization ability the advantage of the loocv method was that each dataset was individually completed as a test set it was not affected by the typical subdivision into a training set and a test set this approach can ensure exclusive use of the data prevent model overfitting from occurring and assess the actual generalization ability of the model the combined error can be expressed as 11 loocv n 1 n i 1 n m s e i according to chen et al 2022 to ensure the comparability of the study results five evaluation measures were selected to characterize the performance of the tpe catboost model the mean absolute error mae 12 mae 1 m i 1 m y i y i the mean squared error mse 13 mse 1 m i 1 m y i y i 2 the root mean squared error rmse 14 rmse 1 m i 1 m y i y i 2 the mean absolute percentage error mape 15 mape 1 n i 1 n y i y i y i the coefficient of determination r2 16 r 2 1 i y i y i 2 i y i y i 2 in the above formulas y i was the predicted value y i was the true value and y i was the average value the mae could reflect the actual situation of the predicted value error mse was the expected value of the square of the difference between the estimated and the observed value it could evaluate the degree of the data change and the smaller the mse the better accuracy of the prediction model rmse was the arithmetic square root of mse the mape was equivalent to normalizing the error at each point reducing the impact of the absolute error from individual outliers r2 could eliminate the influence of dimension on the evaluation measure 4 5 model training the training environment was a graphics workstation configured with intel r core tm i9 10980xe cpu 3 00 ghz nvidia geforce rtx 3090 gpu and 64 gb ram considering that the catboost model could easily access gpu arithmetic to perform operations this experimental environment was expected to improve model training efficiency accordingly the min max normalization method was utilized to process each feature variable and the data normalization formula was as follows 17 x norm x 0 x min x max x min where x norm x 0 x min and x max were the normalized real minimum and maximum values respectively 5 results and discussion 5 1 comparing the effects of different combinations of covariates on estimation accuracy fig 5 shows the mean importance scores of all synoptic variables at different depths for the daily sample estimation results from 2015 to 2019 lat ph sbd dem and tdew ranked in the top five importance scores with values of 7 9 7 22 7 08 6 8 and 6 65 respectively the lowest mean importance score for socc was 1 85 the average importance scores of soil properties and meteorological and spatial location parameters were 5 14 5 46 and 6 65 respectively with spatial location lat and dem being the primary driver of model estimation the importance scores serve as the basis for subsequent evaluation of different combinations of quantitative modeling factors to determine the effect of covariate combinations on the model estimation accuracy we designed seven groups of covariate combinations group 1 using all covariates group 2 meteorology and location tdew tmax tmean slp tmin sp ptotal wu wv dem lng lat group 3 soil properties and location sbd socc sph cc sc fc dem lng lat group 4 meteorology tdew tmax tmean slp tmin sp ptotal wu wv group 5 soil properties sbd socc sph cc sc fc group 6 optimal five parameters lat sph sbd dem tdew and group 7 optimal three parameters lat sph sbd table 6 shows the estimation error results for the whole sample with different combinations of the covariates in terms of the average mse index group 1 which combined all covariates achieved the greatest estimation accuracy with an average mse within 61 23 79 96 and an average rmse within 7 82 8 93 the estimation accuracy of each covariate combination ranked as group 1 group 3 group 6 group 2 group 4 group 5 group 7 compared to group2 and group3 group4 and group5 have an increase in the mse of 3 81 and 12 68 due to the reduction of spatial location information covariates dem lng and lat respectively the mse of group 7 which contained only three covariates was within 74 13 96 85 with an average value of 85 04 and the worst performance as the number of participating modeling factors decreased the mse of group 2 was 2 17 higher than that of group 6 with only five covariates despite the higher number of parameters 12 there are few studies on the spatial estimation of soil moisture over large areas and long time series in the literature for example wu et al 2019a estimated only a single time point for one location at qinghai lake therefore comparing our estimation accuracies with those of other studies is difficult according to a review by chen et al 2022 the r2 of most dsm studies was less than 0 28 but became less accurate at greater soil depths considering that the numerical fluctuations of swc were much higher than those of soil organic carbon and soil organic matter and that the performance in our model remained stable over a long time we believe that the tpe catboost model can offer promising estimation accuracy we further explored the mechanisms of influence of the covariates and evaluated the dynamic adjustment ability of the tpe catboost model one of the main objectives of our study was to validate the gain in model estimation using environmental covariates the results in table 6 demonstrate that the effects of the different covariates on the accuracy of the model estimates varied significantly we focused on the top five covariates lat sph sbd dem and tdew which we evaluated using importance scores lat is the most significant covariate and table 6 demonstrates that the accuracy of model estimation is reduced without spatial location covariates this phenomenon may be since the latitude difference between the northern and southern points of the study area was nearly 25 covering humid and semi humid climates in boreal and temperate zones similarly srivastava et al 2019 showed that the climatic difference significantly influenced the swc variability concerning solar radiation levels across latitudes resulting in significant contrasts in the cycling mechanism of the swc in addition maize has significant differences in water consumption characteristics at different fertility stages baroni et al 2013 which influences swc variation in the root zone luo et al 2020 further indicated that the cropping pattern and fertility cycle in the main maize producing areas of china showed a noticeable progressive feature along the latitudinal direction thus the significant differences in climatic and crop planting characteristics in the north south direction in the study area are the reason for lat being an important covariate the average importance score of dem in spatial location information ranked fourth this may be due to the fact that water tends to flow and accumulate in response to the gravitational potential energy suggesting the use of the dem as a synoptic estimation variable for swc inversion in many studies sabaghy et al 2018 liu et al 2020 demonstrated that the dem influenced swc as the elevation increased spatial location information has a high importance score also in accordance with the definition of the first law of geography goodchild 2009 in the soil the ph value is controlled by soil colloids that are influenced by clay organic matter and oxides contents villalobos and fereres 2016 soil ph reflects vegetation growth potential and soil type reflecting differences in soil and vegetation environments during water transport xia and zhang 2022 ghazali et al 2020 indicated that soil ph was significantly and positively correlated with swc in some areas with periodic flooding r2 0 82 with soil moisture triggering a change in soil ph of up to 100 therefore the differences in spatial characteristics of meteorology vegetation and soil in the study area reflected in the sph may be the reason for the high importance score the physical indicator of the soil sbd integrates the condition of solid soil particles and soil pore space and is a crucial soil physical property that affects water and solute transport bittelli et al 2021 on a large scale the values of sbd are relatively stable over the study period after experiencing a long term wet and dry cycling process under natural conditions pan et al 2022 therefore the difference in the distribution of sbd in space is the key to the model for extracting features yang et al 2016 confirmed a robust negative correlation between swc and sbd r 0 73 notably despite the correlation between socc and swc taneja et al 2021 p socc had the lowest importance score in maize grown fields socc is significantly affected by climate and cropping activities with more pronounced changes in time scales zhang et al 2022 however the socc in this study only provided large scale spatial distribution it is difficult to characterize the spatial variation of socc in the farmland where the monitoring sites are located which may be the reason for the model s difficulty in extracting practical features from the spatial distribution of socc among the meteorological covariates tdew exhibited the highest importance and was strongly correlated with air humidity barometric pressure and extreme rainfall pumo and noto 2021 the study by agam and berliner 2006 revealed that tdew is a crucial indicator for determining the mechanisms of soil surface moisture formation dew formation and direct water vapor sorption tdew is derived from the calculation of air temperature air humidity and atmospheric pressure dong et al 2022 therefore the aggregated characteristics of multiple meteorological parameters may be the reason for the high importance score of tdew it is noteworthy that precipitation is an important source of soil moisture in agricultural fields saeedi et al 2022 however the average importance score of ptotal in this study was only ranked 12th this result may be since precipitation is a small probability event on both temporal and spatial scales its importance is more reflected in the elevated effect of precipitation on swc on the day of precipitation therefore it is reasonable that the average importance of precipitation is lower compared to other covariates for dsm with long time series other studies have obtained similar conclusions fuentes et al 2022 yu et al 2020a variable importance refers to the influence on the model relative to other covariates therefore it does not imply that other covariates do not contribute to the model chen et al 2022 concluded that combining as many environmental covariates as possible could improve the estimation accuracy of the model the estimation accuracy of the different combinations of covariates presented in table 6 indicates that the estimation error of the model increased as the number of covariates decreased studies on the swc estimation model also obtained similar conclusions yu et al 2021 yu et al 2020a the tpe catboost model was oriented toward the daily scale spatial estimation of swc where the meteorological data in the relevant covariates varied daily therefore the ability to dynamically tap the contribution of covariates is key to the model to further explore the contribution of covariate characteristics and test the model s sensitivity the shapley additive explanation shap algorithm was used to calculate the shap values of the covariates in the sample shap is an interpretation method for the individual estimation of models proposed by lundberg and lee 2017 based on coalitional game theory which evaluates the influence of features in each sample by calculating the marginal contribution of features to the model output two sets of extreme weather data were evaluated with july 19 2016 having the maximum average rainfall 43 63 mm and march 10 2016 having the lowest average tmean 1 17 c fig 6 shows the distribution of shap and shap interaction values for the covariates on a typical day the models accurately captured the environmental changes in rainfall and temperature with ptotal and air temperature rising to the second and first positions respectively in terms of characteristic importance based on the july 19 results lat had the most significant influence on the depth estimates this result indicates a significant negative gain with higher latitudes significantly contributing to lower estimates in addition ptotal showed a significant positive gain in swc and decreased importance with depth which is consistent with the pattern of more pronounced changes in surface swc from precipitation the interaction attribution values within the features also captured a distinct interaction between ptotal and lat in the upper four soil depths highlighting the ability of lat to gain on the model is enhanced with less rainfall on march 10 temperature related parameters are more prominent in terms of positive gain capability almost all four covariates related to temperature appear in the top order of importance the interactions at 20 cm 40 cm and 50 cm show that samples with higher tmin values slightly weaken the influence of tdew on the results this result seems to be a conflict caused by the high correlation between the covariates correlation coefficient of 0 91 5 2 comparing the estimation accuracy of full fertility time scales with the optimal combination of covariates fig 7 shows the variation in model estimation accuracy based on daily yearly and monthly statistics the daily variation in estimation accuracy was more drastic with mae from 2015 to 2019 within 4 66 8 09 4 81 8 05 4 70 8 71 4 98 8 06 and 5 08 9 34 respectively and a greater overall fluctuation in 2019 the variation trend was relatively consistent across different soil depths with a greater error in the 40 cm and 50 cm soil layers according to year and month statistics the estimation accuracy showed an increasing trend with increasing depth with average mae ratios from shallow to deep being 6 05 6 08 6 08 6 68 and 6 94 respectively the annual average mae for each depth from 2015 to 2019 was 6 14 6 21 6 24 6 39 and 6 78 respectively the model performed relatively consistently in terms of estimation accuracy over time however the monthly perspective statistics showed a significant difference the average mae from march to october was within 5 77 6 73 the average mae in june showed an obvious high point of 6 73 with the highest error at all depths except 10 cm march exhibited the lowest estimation error at all soil depths with mae values of 5 38 6 33 fig 7 illustrates that the mean errors from march to october show a clear high point of estimation errors likely due to the apparent seasonal influence of precipitation and the temperature difference between the land surface and air tdsa at different depths nie et al 2008 table 7 indicates the monthly population variance statistics of the swc the variance in june was the highest at all depths with a maximum of 131 38 at 50 cm compared to spring and autumn the summer months especially june and july are characterized by higher temperatures more rainfall and more active crop growth resulting in more pronounced soil water exchange qiu et al 2014 maize in the study area reached the heading date between june and july when the leaf area index reached its maximum and plant water demand peaked luo et al 2020 plant transpiration during this period became a major pathway for swc depletion wang et al 2021b differences in field water management superimposed on increased evapotranspiration in the field amplified the differences in water characteristics between regions this in turn results in higher data dispersion in summer which makes it significantly more difficult for the model to estimate the swc 5 3 comparison of the estimation accuracy of regional spatial scales with the optimal combination of covariates fig 8 shows the contrast in the average estimation accuracy among the different provinces in a context where all results were aggregated the mae for the model s estimation accuracy at the 10 cm depth in heilongjiang province was the lowest 2 5 in comparison the mae at the 40 cm depth in hubei province was the highest 10 16 except for jilin province henan province and tianjin the errors at the 50 cm depth in the remaining provinces were significantly higher than those in the surface layer fig 9 shows the spatial distribution of estimation errors aggregated by province and the trend analysis using getis ord gi statistics to identify statistically significant hot and cold spots kumar and parida 2021 the mae of each province was within 3 5 8 29 and there was no obvious pattern or trend with the lowest values presented in heilongjiang and the highest in hubei province the average error at each monitoring station showed a discrete distribution and no evident regular distribution the lowest historical average mae was 2 44 at station 53 853 in linfen shanxi province in contrast station 57 453 in yichang hubei province had the highest recorded average mae 17 94 from the spatial hot spot trend prominent hot spot and cold spot clusters were formed at the intersections of hubei and henan inner mongolia and shanxi respectively according to the third order polynomial fitting curve in the longitude and latitude directions echoing the cold hot spot clusters the errors in the east west direction were relatively smooth and less diverse during the maize growing season rainfall and temperature were the leading drivers of the swc cycle wang et al 2016 both showed decreasing trends from south to north and east to west within the main maize producing regions of china this trend resulted in a large swc dispersion in the southern provinces e g hubei province table 8 shows the statistical results of monitoring station density and the population variance of swc by province the mean population variance of swc for the central provinces of the significant cold hot spot region namely the hubei and shanxi provinces was calculated to be 89 85 and 44 32 respectively the density of monitoring stations varied widely among provinces with an average of 62 3 pcs million km2 we analyzed the pearson s correlation coefficients between the two metrics and the mean mae the average correlation coefficients obtained for the population variance and density were 0 89 and 0 13 respectively the data dispersion significantly affects the model s estimation error while the effect of monitoring station density is hardly detectable similar conclusions were obtained by yu et al 2020b who utilized deep learning algorithms to construct multi depth swc time series estimation models 5 4 comparing the estimation accuracy of different soil depths with the optimal combination of covariates fig 10 shows the scatter plot of the estimated values versus the true observed values for all samples under the optimal combination of covariates the scatter distribution at different soil depths indicated good aggregation and little difference in r2 values was observed across the depths 0 3698 0 3705 0 3299 0 3641 and 0 3421 in addition the density of the scattered points in the central region was much higher than at the edges the observations in the 10 40 interval could be estimated with higher accuracy we further analyzed the statistical distribution of the data at each depth fig 11 shows the model estimation error distribution frequency distribution and frequency distribution of the measured values the measured values at different soil depths showed a pattern similar to a normal distribution with high values at the center and low values at the tails the 25 75 quantile intervals for each depth from 10 to 50 cm were 13 2 27 5 16 30 17 9 32 1 17 33 17 34 while the rmse for each depth in this interval was 4 91 4 95 4 79 5 34 and 5 67 respectively that is 37 2 36 9 41 9 32 7 and 36 5 higher than that of the full data consistent with the distribution of the measured values the estimation accuracy exhibited a high center and low tail distribution the mae values in the interval 0 2 at different soil depths were more than 20 with 58 8 58 1 58 6 54 8 and 52 3 of the samples having mae values smaller than 6 the estimation accuracy of tpe catboost decreased with the increase in soil depth this phenomenon was evident by comparing results at depths of 50 cm and 40 cm with those at 10 cm and 20 cm as shown in fig 7 daily estimation errors and fig 11 error density distribution this observation can be explained by the role of the surface soil 0 20 cm as the core area of the soil atmosphere plant water exchange cycle and soil moisture is mainly controlled by rainfall and evaporation in contrast the swc at greater depths is influenced by topography resulting in longer time scales and discrete numerical distributions of its variability nie et al 2008 the statistical results in table 2 indicate that the mean and sd of swc increased gradually with the increasing soil depth reaching 25 64 and 10 99 respectively at 50 cm the results in table 7 and table 8 also show that the greater dispersion of the deep swc on both temporal and spatial scales makes the model more challenging for feature pattern search and hyperparameter optimization in addition the accuracy of covariates as the source of model characteristic parameters directly affects the estimation accuracy of the model the soil physical and chemical data error increases with increasing soil depth which may also contribute to the decrease in model fitting accuracy he et al 2022 similarly a summary of 244 dsm studies by chen et al 2022 indicated that the model performance usually decreases with depth 5 5 comparing the estimation accuracy of different models with the optimal combination of covariates to verify the advantage of the tpe catboost model in terms of estimation accuracy we selected the daily data for may 15 2019 june 15 2019 and july 15 2019 as examples according to the results in fig 7 the model estimation difficulty was the highest in these three months we adopted the loocv approach for discrimination by comparing the catboost model with default parameters prokhorenkova et al 2018 xgboost chen and guestrin 2016 the gis deterministic method with idw yang et al 2020 ordinary kriging ok gia pham et al 2019 and the algorithms in geostatistical approaches with empirical bayesian kriging ebk gribov and krivoruchko 2020 gis interpolation algorithms were selected for the most remarkable accuracy after adjusting the parameters several times table 9 presents the estimation accuracies of the different models the tpe catboost model in which tpe was hyperparametrically optimized outperformed all controls in estimation accuracy with an accuracy improvement of 15 1 compared to the ebk algorithm the most remarkable accuracy algorithm among gis algorithms moreover the ai algorithm incorporating covariates outperformed the gis interpolation algorithm in terms of the average prediction accuracy at all soil depths with an average rmse of 8 22 the xgboost model which is also an extreme boost ai algorithm had an average rmse of 8 51 signifying a lower accuracy compared with the catboost model with default parameters the ai algorithm can better extract features and estimate trends owing to soil and meteorological environmental covariates concerning the differences in accuracy between the algorithms the study by pouladi et al 2019 on spatial mapping of soil organic matter content obtained conclusions consistent with those of the present study in addition the resulting xgboost model was less accurate in forecasting than the catboost model with default parameters studies by prokhorenkova et al 2018 and zhang et al 2020 also confirmed the advantages of the catboost model according to table 9 the average mse of tpe catboost was reduced by 5 08 compared to the native catboost model the improvement in model estimation accuracy further confirms the optimization capability of the tpe algorithm this result is consistent with other similar studies using the tpe optimization algorithm shen et al 2022 vassallo et al 2021 fig 12 shows the statistical distribution of the optimal hyperparameter values for the catboost model after the tpe algorithm optimization the statistical distribution of the hyperparameters was generally consistent compared to the fixed default values of native catboost the tpe catboost model can dynamically select the most suitable hyperparameter values based on the data characteristics to obtain a higher estimation accuracy table 9 which is an advantage of the proposed model 5 6 instance of spatial estimation and cartographic rendering employing spatial mapping in the gis environment arcgis 10 8 1 in this study the swc distribution at different depths can be visualized the proposed tpe catboost model can be utilized for mapping tasks at any spatial resolution the difference is the mapping efficiency fig 13 shows the spatial mapping results for may 20 2019 at a resolution of 1 km the production process was as follows 1 grid generation producing a 1 km 1 km square grid for the study area using the fishnet tool and obtaining the grid centroids 2 acquisition of attributes uploading the grid points to the gee platform in shapefile format and iterating to obtain point by point multi element synoptic mapping data for the day 3 swc estimation looping through each depth data and substituting the grid points with synoptic data 4 rendering and mapping utilizing the pointtoraster to convert the estimated values at different soil depths of the grid points into a raster image with the exact resolution rendered by stretching and exporting to a map format to accelerate the mapping process we utilized the modelbuilder tool to model the mapping process and automate data processing stefanidis et al 2021 in addition to account for the accuracy of the spatial estimation we selected swc data from the smap satellite on the same day using gee as a reference cui et al 2017 as the smap soil moisture profile data were in the form of relative water content we transformed the image element values of smap images by multiplying them with the soil fc data to standardize the comparison criteria bordoni et al 2018 the swc spatial trends were relatively consistent across the soil depths showing a trend of high humidity in the north and south and low humidity in the center and west a high degree of consistency with the smap data was observed concerning the overall trends and maize growing areas notably the covariates were acquired from gee thus avoiding the time consuming and laborious operation of downloading extracting and storing remote sensing data a single attribute value of the datum could be acquired in less than 5 min enhancing the data collection and processing efficiency efficient data processing is in line with the development of the gee platform gorelick et al 2017 in addition the review study by amani et al 2020 and tamiminia et al 2020 also showed that many similar studies have benefited from the convenience of gee applications 6 conclusion in this study we proposed a tpe catboost approach for spatial estimation of the swc in china s main maize producing areas this approach improves the optimal hyperparameter configuration of catboost via an efficient tpe algorithm data from 175 swc monitoring stations in these regions were used as the benchmark information on soil physical and chemical properties daily scale meteorological data and the spatial coordinates of each monitoring station were extracted from gee to construct a daily swc multi covariate modeling database from march to october in 2015 2019 the model accuracy was evaluated using the loocv method the results were as follows 1 the most outstanding estimation accuracy at different soil depths was obtained with mae values within 6 06 6 94 and errors increasing with soil depth and the lat ph sbd dem and tdew had the highest mean importance score 2 the annual mae from 2015 to 2019 remained within 4 66 9 34 with more significant errors in june 3 the mae across the provinces remained within 3 5 8 29 decreasing from north to south and finally 4 compared with gis based spatial interpolation methods idw ok ebk ai algorithms that combined environmental covariates achieved a higher estimation accuracy the proposed tpe catboost model performed well with an improvement of 15 1 compared with ebk moreover using the shap algorithm we demonstrated that the proposed model was susceptible to changes in covariate gain capacity under extreme weather conditions maximum mean rainfall and minimum mean temperature spatial mapping of the estimation results in the arcgis platform for selected single day data demonstrated high consistency in distribution trends concerning the smap product however the method proposed in this paper still has some shortcomings the utilized swc monitoring stations were located in flat maize fields thus making representation limited in terms of the number of monitoring stations crop types and topographic differences slope gradient and slope aspect furthermore remote sensing based vegetation indicators such as normalized difference vegetation index ndvi leaf area index lai and enhanced vegetation index evi are also correlated with the spatial distribution of swc peng and loew 2017 nevertheless under existing conditions we did not fully access all relevant daily resolution data for the investigated period 2015 2019 via the gee platform therefore in future studies we plan to improve the spatial estimation accuracy of swc by extending more covariates enhancing the resolution of data sources and increasing the representativeness of monitoring stations credit authorship contribution statement jingxin yu methodology investigation

2873,maize is one of the major crops in china the soil water content swc in the root zone of maize is a critical indicator that guides agricultural production decisions and can affect national food security however a daily scale high precision spatial estimation method for swc in china s main maize producing areas has not been well researched therefore we developed a spatial estimation model for swc with a dynamic parameter optimization mechanism termed tpe catboost it combines the catboost algorithm as the core fitting framework with the efficient tree structured parzen estimator tpe algorithm to achieve a dynamic hyperparameter optimization based on covariate characteristics daily measured multi depth swc data at 175 stations from 2015 to 2019 were used as the reference truth and 18 items of information including soil physical and chemical properties daily meteorological conditions and spatial location information were obtained from google earth engine and considered as covariates model training was performed using the leave one out cross validation method estimation error differences were investigated in four dimensions time space depth and the model our key results are as follows 1 by combining all covariates the highest estimation accuracy could be obtained at any soil depth with a mean absolute error mae within 6 06 6 94 the top five mean importance scores of covariates were latitude soil ph bulk density dem and dewpoint temperature 2 the mae for all years remained within 4 66 9 34 with higher errors in june 3 the mae for each province remained within 3 5 8 29 with errors decreasing from north to south and 4 compared with gis based spatial interpolation methods inverse distance weighted ordinary kriging and empirical bayesian kriging ebk artificial intelligence ai algorithms combining environmental covariates xgboost catboost and tpe catboost could achieve better estimation accuracy in particular tpe catboost performed well with an improvement of 15 1 over ebk we also demonstrated that tpe catboost was susceptible to changes in the covariate gain capacity under extreme weather conditions using the shapley additive explanation shap algorithm visual mapping of single day spatial estimation results in arcgis showed high consistency in distribution trends compared with the soil moisture active passive smap product keywords soil moisture tpe catboost google earth engine digital soil mapping data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction maize is the world s high yielding crop and predominant forage grain tanumihardjo et al 2020 its production is therefore crucial for global food security the rapid increase in population climate change and geopolitical frictions are driving international efforts to ensure efficient food production prosekov and ivanova 2018 as china s primary crop maize is sown on more than 43 33 million ha and yielded over 272 55 million tons in 2021 china national bureau of statistics n d soil water content swc is an essential environmental indicator that summarizes the complex interactions of the atmosphere hydrosphere and biosphere jiang et al 2022 an appropriate value of swc is critical for ensuring water uptake and photosynthesis for material accumulation in maize li et al 2022 maize yield is strongly related to the swc rigden et al 2020 song et al 2019 observed that soil water stress decreased the leaf area index lai and biomass and triggered irrecoverable yield losses peichl et al 2018 further demonstrated that soil moisture abnormalities could reduce maize yields by over 10 maintaining the swc in the root zone of maize within the appropriate range through effective agronomic measures and irrigation control is a meaningful way to promote healthy growth and increase grain yield togneri et al 2022 therefore to ensure national food security and an adequate supply of agricultural products it is necessary to determine the swc in the root zone of maize accurately for point scale swc monitoring the swc is typically converted using the soil drying method by calculating the weight of the water lost upon drying although the soil drying method can achieve high accuracy it is invasive as it destroys the soil sample its spatial representativeness is poor owing to the limited number of pieces that can be analyzed and the results are only available after a significant delay rowe 2018 with the development of sensor technology in situ swc determination methods have been developed such as frequency domain reflectometry fdr and time domain reflectometry tdr techniques these methods can provide data with high temporal frequency and accuracy furthermore multi depth swc profiles can be obtained based on the dielectric coefficient of the soil s u et al 2014 however the swc values measured using sensors are generally average for 10 cm radius cylinders around the sensors therefore inferring swc values over larger areas remains challenging however a large scale estimation of the swc distribution in the root zone of main maize producing regions is crucial for guiding irrigation decision making and yield prediction d wu et al 2019 therefore we argue that a large scale swc estimation study is urgently needed to help understand the overall environmental conditions of maize cultivation and guide decision making remote sensing detection technology can meet the need for large scale earth observations using remote sensing data acquisitions the swc has been characterized via products such as the soil moisture active passive smap aquarius stopped because of technical failure on june 8 2015 and the soil moisture and ocean salinity smos bao et al 2019 smap is currently the most suitable remote sensing product for swc colliander et al 2022 xiaoyi wang et al 2021 fuentes et al 2022 further improved the accuracy of smap in australia using a data fusion approach however the level 4 soil moisture product for mass application was released at a frequency of 7 days and a resolution of 9 km furthermore smap is only sensitive to moisture changes in the top layer of the soil 0 5 cm depth and is susceptible to surface roughness colliander et al 2017 posing challenges in providing feedback on the actual moisture conditions at different soil depths in the maize root zone the low return period and detection depth make it difficult for remote sensing swc products to accommodate the planting production needs of precision agriculture mulla 2013 therefore combining existing technological developments and shortcomings to carry out the spatial estimation of swc with the advantages of real time in situ monitoring timeliness and scalability of detection depth is a necessary means to meet the actual agricultural production requirements traditional gis spatial interpolation algorithms such as the inverse distance weighted idw and kriging algorithm are the classical geostatistical methods to produce spatial estimations based on the first law of geography goodchild 2009 however spatial prediction techniques based on the first law of geography or statistical principles only consider the variability in spatial distances they have two essential requirements a sufficient number of samples to characterize the relationships across the study area effectively and the smoothness of the extracted relationships zhu et al 2018 therefore considering that the traditional spatial interpolation method requires a large sample size and does not consider the crucial influence of the environment on the swc it is difficult to obtain high spatial estimation accuracy shen et al 2019 the third law of geography states that the more similar the geographic configuration of the target points the more similar the values of the target variables zhu et al 2018 therefore integrating environmental covariates such as soil properties and meteorological parameters to carry out a spatial estimation of swc is a novel research perspective research shows that adding covariates can effectively improve the estimation accuracy of a model chen et al 2022 yu et al 2021 yu et al 2020a soil parameters such as the soil ph and soil bulk density showed a high correlation with the soil water storage capacity ghazali et al 2020 yang et al 2016 meteorological parameters directly drove soil moisture changes through evapotranspiration precipitation and other moisture cycle transport processes agam and berliner 2006 sun et al 2019 hence combining soil and meteorological covariates can better characterize the spatial distribution of swc digital soil mapping dsm technology is a novel solution to evaluate difficult to measure soil parameters by combining environmental parameters with efficient algorithms for spatial estimation wadoux et al 2020 chen et al 2022 highlighted an exponential growth in recent years by reviewing 244 studies concerning dsm however most of these studies have focused on estimating soil organic carbon and particle size fractions in small areas few studies have been conducted for the spatial estimation of swc over large areas and multiple soil depths thus there is an urgent need to explore synergistic modeling of multiple environmental covariates to improve the accuracy of swc spatial estimation efficient and one stop access to multi source remote sensing and its derived data presents challenges for scientific research tamiminia et al 2020 in this respect google earth engine gee allows online visualization and computational analysis processing of large amounts of global scale geoscientific information especially satellite image data gorelick et al 2017 gee platform enables rapid batch data acquisition processing computation and analysis saving considerable time venkatappa et al 2021 thus far gee has been widely used in hydrological studies land cover land use classification urban planning natural hazards climate analysis and image processing amani et al 2020 therefore a significant advantage is utilizing the gee platform to obtain synoptic estimation factors such as soil meteorology and topography for swc monitoring stations the rapid development of machine learning artificial intelligence ai algorithms has effectively improved the ability of dsm to fit complex nonlinear relationships chen et al 2022 with the development of ai technology algorithms derived from deep neural networks dnn and decision tree theory have given rise to two dominant ai algorithm classes hateffard et al 2019 dnn models such as deep learning have become popular owing to their highly accurate fitting ability however they usually require a longer training time and a large amount of training data therefore they are unsuitable for swc spatial estimation lin 2020 in contrast the decision tree based approach can be used to efficiently processes massive amounts of data through three steps feature selection decision tree generation and decision tree pruning to achieve an efficient and accurate fitting performance intuitively obtain a feature importance ranking and facilitate the selection of collaborative mapping parameters mienye et al 2019 with ensemble learning el as the theoretical foundation decision tree based models have developed into classical model algorithms such as random forest gradient boosting decision tree gbdt and extreme gradient boosting xgboost by constructing and combining multiple learners to complete the learning task and obtain more accurate stable and robust final results polikar 2012 based on the classical algorithm yandex released the catboost model framework based on the improved gbdt algorithm in 2018 prokhorenkova et al 2018 catboost solved the problem of gradient bias and estimation bias that often occurred in earlier machine learning algorithms based on the gbdt framework thus reducing the occurrence of overfitting and improving the generalization ability of the algorithm in hydrology the catboost based models have been used to estimate reference evapotranspiration et0 showing significant advantages in estimation accuracy and fitting efficiency huang et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 however recent studies on the spatial estimation of swc still used traditional regression algorithms such as random forest fathololoumi et al 2021 regression trees zeraatpisheh et al 2019 and multiple linear regression fathololoumi et al 2020 thus there is an urgent need to apply more advanced ai algorithms to achieve high accuracy swc spatial estimation studies have been conducted to apply the catboost model as a core model for agricultural water resources cisty and cyprich 2020 reported that catboost has a significant accuracy advantage over multiple linear regression methods for fitting swc change processes in western slovakia huang et al 2019 and zhang et al 2020 obtained similar positive conclusions in studies that targeted soil evapotranspiration estimation hyperparameter optimization is the core step of automatic machine learning modeling it significantly impacts the model fitting accuracy stuke et al 2021 commonly used hyperparameter optimization methods include grid search random search swarm intelligence and bayesian optimization algorithms grid search is an exhaustive search applied to a low dimensional parameter search space ghawi and pfeffer 2019 the random search uses a random jumping strategy in the hyperparameter combination selection process which significantly improves the search speed but is equally prone to falling into local optimal solutions because of the uncertainty of random search sampling li and talwalkar 2020 the swarm intelligence algorithm is complex and computationally intensive for modeling noh et al 2020 the bayesian optimization algorithm which adjusts the hyperparameters by approximating the posterior distribution of the unknown function through prior knowledge appears to be more approximate than traditional optimization algorithms stuke et al 2021 this algorithm significantly improves the efficiency of hyperparameter sampling while also successfully obtaining the globally optimal solution bayesian optimization for machine learning tuning was first proposed by snoek et al 2012 to update the posterior distribution of the objective function by continuously adding sample points given the optimized objective function as a variant of the outstanding performance of bayesian algorithms the tree structured parzen estimator tpe was constructed based on the sequential model based optimization smbo method which utilizes kernel density estimation kde to generate the proxy model the tpe has an excellent global exploration ability and does not easily fall into a local optimum hence it is more suitable for swc data characterized by high spatial and temporal variability researchers have achieved good performance by utilizing the tpe to optimize machine learning models vassallo et al 2021 constructed a tpe optimized xgboost aml model and demonstrated that the method outperformed the current preferred random forest algorithm and reduced the impact of concept drift shen et al 2022 used tpe to optimize the natural gradient boosting model hyperparameters for runoff probability estimation and the model performance improved in all metrics of deterministic estimation compared to the baseline model therefore by integrating the catboost model with the excellent global optimization seeking ability of the tpe algorithm we constructed a tpe catboost soil moisture spatial estimation model using the tpe algorithm to optimize the critical hyperparameters of catboost daily and multi depth soil volumetric water content data from 2015 to 2019 in the main maize producing areas of china were used as the reference truth the soil physical and chemical properties daily meteorological and spatial location data in the study area were obtained from gee model training and evaluation were performed using the leave one out cross validation loocv method the study s main objective was to investigate a novel dynamic adaptive ai method for daily swc spatial estimation in maize production areas and verify its accuracy 2 study area we focused on the main maize production areas in china 28 58 11 53 34 10 n 97 12 32 134 53 57 e identified based on maize production sown area and monitoring stations these areas included the heilongjiang jilin inner mongolia autonomous region beijing tianjin hebei shanxi henan anhui jiangsu and hubei provinces fig 1 according to a report published by the national bureau of statistics of china this area featured an average annual maize cultivation area of over 26 53 million ha and an average annual production of over 160 million tons from 2015 to 2019 making it the core maize production base of china the region s total area is approximately 2 81 million km2 covering a vast territory with complex meteorological and topographical conditions the study area covers cold temperate humid and semi humid climates from north to south creating a significant challenge to achieving accurate spatial estimation the primary planting time of maize in the study area spans from march to october during which the northern permafrost thaws and sensors installed at different depths can determine accurate swc values 3 data acquisition and analysis 3 1 data

meteorology and digital elevation model dem were obtained from gee gorelick et al 2017 benefiting from gee s enormous data resources and online integrated development environment ide we utilized python language in gee code editor to extract and export site properties the data were exported to google drive in csv format for storage and downloading to local devices tamiminia et al 2020 the data obtained from the gee platform were as follows 1 soil physicochemical property data were obtained from the dataset provided by envirometrix ltd for 2018 this dataset contained soil field capacity swc

existing satellite based dems srtm3 v2 1 and aw3d 30 m v1 representing topographic elevations at 3 s resolution approximately 90 m at the equator and covering the land area within 90 n 60s referenced to the egm96 geoid table 1 lists all the metrics with name units resolution value summary dataset provider and gee data acquisition code 3 2 data processing and analysis raw swc monitoring data were collected at a frequency of 1 h and converted to daily data by averaging the daily values for different soil depths some soil property data from gee were of integer type sbd socc and sph they needed to be converted according to the scale of the data source to recover their valid values moreover for ease of interpretation and understanding we converted the raw meteorological data from k to c for temperature pa to hpa for surface sea level pressure and m to mm for total daily precipitation considering the difficulty in achieving consistency in soil depths between the data provided by the different data sources we selected the nearest depth for matching we matched svwc10 to the 0 cm depth svwc20 to the 10 cm depth svwc30 and svwc40 to the 30 cm depth and svwc50 to the 60 cm soil depth data fig 2 shows the daily average swc evolution of the soil profiles in the study area at the time series level with the average swc within 15 1 29 7 the swc fluctuations are more intense and the average swc is lower at 10 cm soil depth compared to deeper soils table 2 presents the units mean standard deviation sd maximum minimum and median values for different swc depths soil physicochemical

degree of linear correlation between two continuous variables jebli et al 2021 pearson s correlation coefficient p was defined as follows 1 p i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where x i and y i were the characteristic variables x and y were the means of n data p took values in the range 1 1 and positive and negative values of p indicated that the two variables are positively and negatively correlated with each other respectively fig 3 illustrates pearson s correlation coefficients between multi depth swc data and covariates overall the correlation between soil physicochemical properties and swc was high within 0 53 0 45 for sand content 0 42 0 48 for clay content 0 46 0 36 for soil ph and 0 26 0 37 for fc the correlation coefficients for the dem were within 0 39 0 51 correlation coefficients for lat were within 0 35 0 40 which were significantly higher than those for lng 4 methodology based on past research progress we constructed an swc spatial estimation model tpe catboost to optimize hyperparameters at the daily scale automatically fig 4 in particular 1 the gee platform was utilized to obtain soil meteorological and topographic covariate data 2 catboost was utilized as the base fitting algorithm for soil meteorological and location covariates 3 the tpe algorithm was combined to search for the optimal combination of hyperparameters based on data characteristics and 4 the loocv method was utilized to maximize the model s generalization estimation capability and develop an autonomous optimization model for swc estimation 4 1 catboost we estimated the spatial swc with 18 environmental covariates sph socc sbd fc sc cc tmean tmin tmax tdew ptotal sp slp wu wv dem lng and lat which posed a severe challenge to the model s ability to perform complex nonlinear regressions catboost is a gradient boosting decision tree based machine learning framework that enhances and improves the gbdt algorithm zhang et al 2020 significantly improving multivariate fitting ability unlike the traditional gbdt catboost has a unique processing flow for categorical features all samples are randomly sorted subsequently a value is obtained for one of the category type features each instance with that feature converted to a numeric type takes a mean value based on the category label ranked before that sample priority and weighting factors are added to generate a new numeric variable this approach reduces the noise associated with low frequency multi environment covariate features the estimation for swc was treated as a regression problem therefore the catboost calculation priority was obtained by averaging the label values assuming a ranking of σ 1 2 n then x σ p k could be replaced by 2 x σ p k j 1 p 1 x σ j k x σ p k y σ j a p j 1 p 1 x σ j k x σ p k a where a was a weighting factor greater than 0 and p was an added a priori term although combining soil meteorological and spatial location covariates often led to new feature types for higher estimation accuracy catboost enabled the ability to combine new features in constructing tree structures when building a new tree catboost used greedy methods to consider combinations and construct the choice of split points no combinations were considered when the tree was split for the first time when the next split was performed all combinations of the current tree and category based features were combined with all category based features in the dataset the algorithm dynamically converted the new varieties of category based features into numerical features the pseudo code process is shown in table 3 the swc spatial estimation model s generalization ability is crucial to the application s performance catboost improves the model generalization ability by replacing the gradient estimation method in the traditional algorithm with an ordered boosting which mitigates the bias of gradient estimation to obtain an unbiased gradient estimate catboost trained a separate model m i for each sample x i model m i was obtained by using a training set that does not contain a sample x i m i was used to obtain a gradient estimate of the samples which was used to train the base learner and obtain the final model the ordered boosting algorithm could be written in pseudo code as shown in table 4 4 2 tree structured parzen estimator optimization algorithms could help catboost select the optimal hyperparameters during training and improve the swc spatial estimation accuracy the bayesian optimization algorithms belonged to the high performance global optimization algorithms the optimization process utilized bayes theorem to fit the objective function using a probabilistic proxy model and selected the next evaluation point based on the results of the prior sampling to quickly reach the optimal solution which could be expressed as 3 p f h i p h i f p f p h i 4 h i x 1 f x 1 x i f x i where p f and p h i f were the prior probability distribution and likelihood distribution of f respectively p f h i denoted the parameter f conditional probability distribution when the ensemble of observations h i had been given as the posterior probability distribution the tpe algorithm utilized in this study as a probabilistic proxy model defined p h i f in eq 3 as 5 p x y l x i f y y g x i f y y where y m i n x 1 f x 1 x i f x i denoted the optimal value of the observation threshold l x was the density estimate of the loss function of observation x less than y and g x denoted the density estimate of the loss function of the observation x greater than or equal to y tpe utilized the expected improvement expected improvement ei as the sampling function to select the next evaluation point that had an optimal effect on the objective function value 6 e i y x y y y p y x d y y y y p x y p y p x d y when p y x integrated positively at y y setting the hyperparameter x for algorithmic modeling would produce better results than the optimal value on the observation threshold let γ p y y and constructed eq 7 and eq 8 as 7 p x r p xy p y d y γ l x 1 γ g x 8 y y y p x y p y d y γ y l x l x y p y d y substituting into eq 6 yields eq 9 9 ei y x γ y l x l x y p y d y γ l x 1 γ g x γ g x l x 1 γ 1 equation 9 showed that the maximum ei value was obtained when the hyperparameter had the maximum probability l x and minimum probability g x through tpe the sample hyperparameter ensemble was constructed by l x and g x evaluating in the form of l x g x during each iteration the algorithm returned the point x with the maximum ei value 4 3 tpe catboost the tpe algorithm was used to dynamically optimize the hyperparameters of the catboost model based on daily multi covariate features to achieve the optimal fitting accuracy for the swc spatial dataset the process of hyperparameter optimization could be expressed as 10 x arg min x χ f x where f x represented the objective function of catboost and x was the parameter when f x achieved the most significant results in contrast to other optimization methods automatic hyperparameter tuning for tpe could be achieved by developing knowledge of the relationship between the hyperparameter values and model performance in turn a priori knowledge was used to make inferences about the choice of the next set of hyperparameters thus the number of trials could be minimized and the experimental efficiency increased when determining the optimal combination of hyperparameter values the number of iterations of the tpe was set to 200 details of the catboost hyperparameters are listed in table 5 iterations learning rate and depth parameters had a crucial influence on the ability to fit the catboost model bentéjac et al 2021 therefore we performed a dynamic optimization search for these three parameters the tpe catboost algorithm was executed according to the following instructions 1 import the raw data of each monitoring point in the study area on a particular day set the catboost hyperparameter range and generate a random set of initialized parameter combinations 2 perform tpe probability density estimation to calculate ei values using the sampling function select the following parameter combination to be evaluated based on the ei values sampled in the previous sequence 3 input the parameter combination with the maximum ei value into the catboost estimation model for training and output the model estimation results under the current hyperparameters 4 repeat step 2 according to the number of iterations of the tpe correct the sampling function and select the parameter combination corresponding to the most incredible accuracy among them as the hyperparameter configuration of the model for swc space estimation 4 4 cross validation and evaluation criteria considering the sparse distribution of swc monitoring stations in the main maize producing areas we utilized the loocv method to evaluate the generalization fit accuracy of the model to explore better the relationship between multi depth moisture data and synergistic factors loocv was a particular form of the k fold cross validation method which could be considered the n fold cross validation when k was equal to the n fold cross validation when the sample size n it meant that one data sample at a time was taken as the only element of the test set and all the remaining n 1 data points were the corresponding training set n iterations were needed for each round of training and the average error of all iterations was calculated to assess the model s hyperparameters and generalization ability the advantage of the loocv method was that each dataset was individually completed as a test set it was not affected by the typical subdivision into a training set and a test set this approach can ensure exclusive use of the data prevent model overfitting from occurring and assess the actual generalization ability of the model the combined error can be expressed as 11 loocv n 1 n i 1 n m s e i according to chen et al 2022 to ensure the comparability of the study results five evaluation measures were selected to characterize the performance of the tpe catboost model the mean absolute error mae 12 mae 1 m i 1 m y i y i the mean squared error mse 13 mse 1 m i 1 m y i y i 2 the root mean squared error rmse 14 rmse 1 m i 1 m y i y i 2 the mean absolute percentage error mape 15 mape 1 n i 1 n y i y i y i the coefficient of determination r2 16 r 2 1 i y i y i 2 i y i y i 2 in the above formulas y i was the predicted value y i was the true value and y i was the average value the mae could reflect the actual situation of the predicted value error mse was the expected value of the square of the difference between the estimated and the observed value it could evaluate the degree of the data change and the smaller the mse the better accuracy of the prediction model rmse was the arithmetic square root of mse the mape was equivalent to normalizing the error at each point reducing the impact of the absolute error from individual outliers r2 could eliminate the influence of dimension on the evaluation measure 4 5 model training the training environment was a graphics workstation configured with intel r core tm i9 10980xe cpu 3 00 ghz nvidia geforce rtx 3090 gpu and 64 gb ram considering that the catboost model could easily access gpu arithmetic to perform operations this experimental environment was expected to improve model training efficiency accordingly the min max normalization method was utilized to process each feature variable and the data normalization formula was as follows 17 x norm x 0 x min x max x min where x norm x 0 x min and x max were the normalized real minimum and maximum values respectively 5 results and discussion 5 1 comparing the effects of different combinations of covariates on estimation accuracy fig 5 shows the mean importance scores of all synoptic variables at different depths for the daily sample estimation results from 2015 to 2019 lat ph sbd dem and tdew ranked in the top five importance scores with values of 7 9 7 22 7 08 6 8 and 6 65 respectively the lowest mean importance score for socc was 1 85 the average importance scores of soil properties and meteorological and spatial location parameters were 5 14 5 46 and 6 65 respectively with spatial location lat and dem being the primary driver of model estimation the importance scores serve as the basis for subsequent evaluation of different combinations of quantitative modeling factors to determine the effect of covariate combinations on the model estimation accuracy we designed seven groups of covariate combinations group 1 using all covariates group 2 meteorology and location tdew tmax tmean slp tmin sp ptotal wu wv dem lng lat group 3 soil properties and location sbd socc sph cc sc fc dem lng lat group 4 meteorology tdew tmax tmean slp tmin sp ptotal wu wv group 5 soil properties sbd socc sph cc sc fc group 6 optimal five parameters lat sph sbd dem tdew and group 7 optimal three parameters lat sph sbd table 6 shows the estimation error results for the whole sample with different combinations of the covariates in terms of the average mse index group 1 which combined all covariates achieved the greatest estimation accuracy with an average mse within 61 23 79 96 and an average rmse within 7 82 8 93 the estimation accuracy of each covariate combination ranked as group 1 group 3 group 6 group 2 group 4 group 5 group 7 compared to group2 and group3 group4 and group5 have an increase in the mse of 3 81 and 12 68 due to the reduction of spatial location information covariates dem lng and lat respectively the mse of group 7 which contained only three covariates was within 74 13 96 85 with an average value of 85 04 and the worst performance as the number of participating modeling factors decreased the mse of group 2 was 2 17 higher than that of group 6 with only five covariates despite the higher number of parameters 12 there are few studies on the spatial estimation of soil moisture over large areas and long time series in the literature for example wu et al 2019a estimated only a single time point for one location at qinghai lake therefore comparing our estimation accuracies with those of other studies is difficult according to a review by chen et al 2022 the r2 of most dsm studies was less than 0 28 but became less accurate at greater soil depths considering that the numerical fluctuations of swc were much higher than those of soil organic carbon and soil organic matter and that the performance in our model remained stable over a long time we believe that the tpe catboost model can offer promising estimation accuracy we further explored the mechanisms of influence of the covariates and evaluated the dynamic adjustment ability of the tpe catboost model one of the main objectives of our study was to validate the gain in model estimation using environmental covariates the results in table 6 demonstrate that the effects of the different covariates on the accuracy of the model estimates varied significantly we focused on the top five covariates lat sph sbd dem and tdew which we evaluated using importance scores lat is the most significant covariate and table 6 demonstrates that the accuracy of model estimation is reduced without spatial location covariates this phenomenon may be since the latitude difference between the northern and southern points of the study area was nearly 25 covering humid and semi humid climates in boreal and temperate zones similarly srivastava et al 2019 showed that the climatic difference significantly influenced the swc variability concerning solar radiation levels across latitudes resulting in significant contrasts in the cycling mechanism of the swc in addition maize has significant differences in water consumption characteristics at different fertility stages baroni et al 2013 which influences swc variation in the root zone luo et al 2020 further indicated that the cropping pattern and fertility cycle in the main maize producing areas of china showed a noticeable progressive feature along the latitudinal direction thus the significant differences in climatic and crop planting characteristics in the north south direction in the study area are the reason for lat being an important covariate the average importance score of dem in spatial location information ranked fourth this may be due to the fact that water tends to flow and accumulate in response to the gravitational potential energy suggesting the use of the dem as a synoptic estimation variable for swc inversion in many studies sabaghy et al 2018 liu et al 2020 demonstrated that the dem influenced swc as the elevation increased spatial location information has a high importance score also in accordance with the definition of the first law of geography goodchild 2009 in the soil the ph value is controlled by soil colloids that are influenced by clay organic matter and oxides contents villalobos and fereres 2016 soil ph reflects vegetation growth potential and soil type reflecting differences in soil and vegetation environments during water transport xia and zhang 2022 ghazali et al 2020 indicated that soil ph was significantly and positively correlated with swc in some areas with periodic flooding r2 0 82 with soil moisture triggering a change in soil ph of up to 100 therefore the differences in spatial characteristics of meteorology vegetation and soil in the study area reflected in the sph may be the reason for the high importance score the physical indicator of the soil sbd integrates the condition of solid soil particles and soil pore space and is a crucial soil physical property that affects water and solute transport bittelli et al 2021 on a large scale the values of sbd are relatively stable over the study period after experiencing a long term wet and dry cycling process under natural conditions pan et al 2022 therefore the difference in the distribution of sbd in space is the key to the model for extracting features yang et al 2016 confirmed a robust negative correlation between swc and sbd r 0 73 notably despite the correlation between socc and swc taneja et al 2021 p socc had the lowest importance score in maize grown fields socc is significantly affected by climate and cropping activities with more pronounced changes in time scales zhang et al 2022 however the socc in this study only provided large scale spatial distribution it is difficult to characterize the spatial variation of socc in the farmland where the monitoring sites are located which may be the reason for the model s difficulty in extracting practical features from the spatial distribution of socc among the meteorological covariates tdew exhibited the highest importance and was strongly correlated with air humidity barometric pressure and extreme rainfall pumo and noto 2021 the study by agam and berliner 2006 revealed that tdew is a crucial indicator for determining the mechanisms of soil surface moisture formation dew formation and direct water vapor sorption tdew is derived from the calculation of air temperature air humidity and atmospheric pressure dong et al 2022 therefore the aggregated characteristics of multiple meteorological parameters may be the reason for the high importance score of tdew it is noteworthy that precipitation is an important source of soil moisture in agricultural fields saeedi et al 2022 however the average importance score of ptotal in this study was only ranked 12th this result may be since precipitation is a small probability event on both temporal and spatial scales its importance is more reflected in the elevated effect of precipitation on swc on the day of precipitation therefore it is reasonable that the average importance of precipitation is lower compared to other covariates for dsm with long time series other studies have obtained similar conclusions fuentes et al 2022 yu et al 2020a variable importance refers to the influence on the model relative to other covariates therefore it does not imply that other covariates do not contribute to the model chen et al 2022 concluded that combining as many environmental covariates as possible could improve the estimation accuracy of the model the estimation accuracy of the different combinations of covariates presented in table 6 indicates that the estimation error of the model increased as the number of covariates decreased studies on the swc estimation model also obtained similar conclusions yu et al 2021 yu et al 2020a the tpe catboost model was oriented toward the daily scale spatial estimation of swc where the meteorological data in the relevant covariates varied daily therefore the ability to dynamically tap the contribution of covariates is key to the model to further explore the contribution of covariate characteristics and test the model s sensitivity the shapley additive explanation shap algorithm was used to calculate the shap values of the covariates in the sample shap is an interpretation method for the individual estimation of models proposed by lundberg and lee 2017 based on coalitional game theory which evaluates the influence of features in each sample by calculating the marginal contribution of features to the model output two sets of extreme weather data were evaluated with july 19 2016 having the maximum average rainfall 43 63 mm and march 10 2016 having the lowest average tmean 1 17 c fig 6 shows the distribution of shap and shap interaction values for the covariates on a typical day the models accurately captured the environmental changes in rainfall and temperature with ptotal and air temperature rising to the second and first positions respectively in terms of characteristic importance based on the july 19 results lat had the most significant influence on the depth estimates this result indicates a significant negative gain with higher latitudes significantly contributing to lower estimates in addition ptotal showed a significant positive gain in swc and decreased importance with depth which is consistent with the pattern of more pronounced changes in surface swc from precipitation the interaction attribution values within the features also captured a distinct interaction between ptotal and lat in the upper four soil depths highlighting the ability of lat to gain on the model is enhanced with less rainfall on march 10 temperature related parameters are more prominent in terms of positive gain capability almost all four covariates related to temperature appear in the top order of importance the interactions at 20 cm 40 cm and 50 cm show that samples with higher tmin values slightly weaken the influence of tdew on the results this result seems to be a conflict caused by the high correlation between the covariates correlation coefficient of 0 91 5 2 comparing the estimation accuracy of full fertility time scales with the optimal combination of covariates fig 7 shows the variation in model estimation accuracy based on daily yearly and monthly statistics the daily variation in estimation accuracy was more drastic with mae from 2015 to 2019 within 4 66 8 09 4 81 8 05 4 70 8 71 4 98 8 06 and 5 08 9 34 respectively and a greater overall fluctuation in 2019 the variation trend was relatively consistent across different soil depths with a greater error in the 40 cm and 50 cm soil layers according to year and month statistics the estimation accuracy showed an increasing trend with increasing depth with average mae ratios from shallow to deep being 6 05 6 08 6 08 6 68 and 6 94 respectively the annual average mae for each depth from 2015 to 2019 was 6 14 6 21 6 24 6 39 and 6 78 respectively the model performed relatively consistently in terms of estimation accuracy over time however the monthly perspective statistics showed a significant difference the average mae from march to october was within 5 77 6 73 the average mae in june showed an obvious high point of 6 73 with the highest error at all depths except 10 cm march exhibited the lowest estimation error at all soil depths with mae values of 5 38 6 33 fig 7 illustrates that the mean errors from march to october show a clear high point of estimation errors likely due to the apparent seasonal influence of precipitation and the temperature difference between the land surface and air tdsa at different depths nie et al 2008 table 7 indicates the monthly population variance statistics of the swc the variance in june was the highest at all depths with a maximum of 131 38 at 50 cm compared to spring and autumn the summer months especially june and july are characterized by higher temperatures more rainfall and more active crop growth resulting in more pronounced soil water exchange qiu et al 2014 maize in the study area reached the heading date between june and july when the leaf area index reached its maximum and plant water demand peaked luo et al 2020 plant transpiration during this period became a major pathway for swc depletion wang et al 2021b differences in field water management superimposed on increased evapotranspiration in the field amplified the differences in water characteristics between regions this in turn results in higher data dispersion in summer which makes it significantly more difficult for the model to estimate the swc 5 3 comparison of the estimation accuracy of regional spatial scales with the optimal combination of covariates fig 8 shows the contrast in the average estimation accuracy among the different provinces in a context where all results were aggregated the mae for the model s estimation accuracy at the 10 cm depth in heilongjiang province was the lowest 2 5 in comparison the mae at the 40 cm depth in hubei province was the highest 10 16 except for jilin province henan province and tianjin the errors at the 50 cm depth in the remaining provinces were significantly higher than those in the surface layer fig 9 shows the spatial distribution of estimation errors aggregated by province and the trend analysis using getis ord gi statistics to identify statistically significant hot and cold spots kumar and parida 2021 the mae of each province was within 3 5 8 29 and there was no obvious pattern or trend with the lowest values presented in heilongjiang and the highest in hubei province the average error at each monitoring station showed a discrete distribution and no evident regular distribution the lowest historical average mae was 2 44 at station 53 853 in linfen shanxi province in contrast station 57 453 in yichang hubei province had the highest recorded average mae 17 94 from the spatial hot spot trend prominent hot spot and cold spot clusters were formed at the intersections of hubei and henan inner mongolia and shanxi respectively according to the third order polynomial fitting curve in the longitude and latitude directions echoing the cold hot spot clusters the errors in the east west direction were relatively smooth and less diverse during the maize growing season rainfall and temperature were the leading drivers of the swc cycle wang et al 2016 both showed decreasing trends from south to north and east to west within the main maize producing regions of china this trend resulted in a large swc dispersion in the southern provinces e g hubei province table 8 shows the statistical results of monitoring station density and the population variance of swc by province the mean population variance of swc for the central provinces of the significant cold hot spot region namely the hubei and shanxi provinces was calculated to be 89 85 and 44 32 respectively the density of monitoring stations varied widely among provinces with an average of 62 3 pcs million km2 we analyzed the pearson s correlation coefficients between the two metrics and the mean mae the average correlation coefficients obtained for the population variance and density were 0 89 and 0 13 respectively the data dispersion significantly affects the model s estimation error while the effect of monitoring station density is hardly detectable similar conclusions were obtained by yu et al 2020b who utilized deep learning algorithms to construct multi depth swc time series estimation models 5 4 comparing the estimation accuracy of different soil depths with the optimal combination of covariates fig 10 shows the scatter plot of the estimated values versus the true observed values for all samples under the optimal combination of covariates the scatter distribution at different soil depths indicated good aggregation and little difference in r2 values was observed across the depths 0 3698 0 3705 0 3299 0 3641 and 0 3421 in addition the density of the scattered points in the central region was much higher than at the edges the observations in the 10 40 interval could be estimated with higher accuracy we further analyzed the statistical distribution of the data at each depth fig 11 shows the model estimation error distribution frequency distribution and frequency distribution of the measured values the measured values at different soil depths showed a pattern similar to a normal distribution with high values at the center and low values at the tails the 25 75 quantile intervals for each depth from 10 to 50 cm were 13 2 27 5 16 30 17 9 32 1 17 33 17 34 while the rmse for each depth in this interval was 4 91 4 95 4 79 5 34 and 5 67 respectively that is 37 2 36 9 41 9 32 7 and 36 5 higher than that of the full data consistent with the distribution of the measured values the estimation accuracy exhibited a high center and low tail distribution the mae values in the interval 0 2 at different soil depths were more than 20 with 58 8 58 1 58 6 54 8 and 52 3 of the samples having mae values smaller than 6 the estimation accuracy of tpe catboost decreased with the increase in soil depth this phenomenon was evident by comparing results at depths of 50 cm and 40 cm with those at 10 cm and 20 cm as shown in fig 7 daily estimation errors and fig 11 error density distribution this observation can be explained by the role of the surface soil 0 20 cm as the core area of the soil atmosphere plant water exchange cycle and soil moisture is mainly controlled by rainfall and evaporation in contrast the swc at greater depths is influenced by topography resulting in longer time scales and discrete numerical distributions of its variability nie et al 2008 the statistical results in table 2 indicate that the mean and sd of swc increased gradually with the increasing soil depth reaching 25 64 and 10 99 respectively at 50 cm the results in table 7 and table 8 also show that the greater dispersion of the deep swc on both temporal and spatial scales makes the model more challenging for feature pattern search and hyperparameter optimization in addition the accuracy of covariates as the source of model characteristic parameters directly affects the estimation accuracy of the model the soil physical and chemical data error increases with increasing soil depth which may also contribute to the decrease in model fitting accuracy he et al 2022 similarly a summary of 244 dsm studies by chen et al 2022 indicated that the model performance usually decreases with depth 5 5 comparing the estimation accuracy of different models with the optimal combination of covariates to verify the advantage of the tpe catboost model in terms of estimation accuracy we selected the daily data for may 15 2019 june 15 2019 and july 15 2019 as examples according to the results in fig 7 the model estimation difficulty was the highest in these three months we adopted the loocv approach for discrimination by comparing the catboost model with default parameters prokhorenkova et al 2018 xgboost chen and guestrin 2016 the gis deterministic method with idw yang et al 2020 ordinary kriging ok gia pham et al 2019 and the algorithms in geostatistical approaches with empirical bayesian kriging ebk gribov and krivoruchko 2020 gis interpolation algorithms were selected for the most remarkable accuracy after adjusting the parameters several times table 9 presents the estimation accuracies of the different models the tpe catboost model in which tpe was hyperparametrically optimized outperformed all controls in estimation accuracy with an accuracy improvement of 15 1 compared to the ebk algorithm the most remarkable accuracy algorithm among gis algorithms moreover the ai algorithm incorporating covariates outperformed the gis interpolation algorithm in terms of the average prediction accuracy at all soil depths with an average rmse of 8 22 the xgboost model which is also an extreme boost ai algorithm had an average rmse of 8 51 signifying a lower accuracy compared with the catboost model with default parameters the ai algorithm can better extract features and estimate trends owing to soil and meteorological environmental covariates concerning the differences in accuracy between the algorithms the study by pouladi et al 2019 on spatial mapping of soil organic matter content obtained conclusions consistent with those of the present study in addition the resulting xgboost model was less accurate in forecasting than the catboost model with default parameters studies by prokhorenkova et al 2018 and zhang et al 2020 also confirmed the advantages of the catboost model according to table 9 the average mse of tpe catboost was reduced by 5 08 compared to the native catboost model the improvement in model estimation accuracy further confirms the optimization capability of the tpe algorithm this result is consistent with other similar studies using the tpe optimization algorithm shen et al 2022 vassallo et al 2021 fig 12 shows the statistical distribution of the optimal hyperparameter values for the catboost model after the tpe algorithm optimization the statistical distribution of the hyperparameters was generally consistent compared to the fixed default values of native catboost the tpe catboost model can dynamically select the most suitable hyperparameter values based on the data characteristics to obtain a higher estimation accuracy table 9 which is an advantage of the proposed model 5 6 instance of spatial estimation and cartographic rendering employing spatial mapping in the gis environment arcgis 10 8 1 in this study the swc distribution at different depths can be visualized the proposed tpe catboost model can be utilized for mapping tasks at any spatial resolution the difference is the mapping efficiency fig 13 shows the spatial mapping results for may 20 2019 at a resolution of 1 km the production process was as follows 1 grid generation producing a 1 km 1 km square grid for the study area using the fishnet tool and obtaining the grid centroids 2 acquisition of attributes uploading the grid points to the gee platform in shapefile format and iterating to obtain point by point multi element synoptic mapping data for the day 3 swc estimation looping through each depth data and substituting the grid points with synoptic data 4 rendering and mapping utilizing the pointtoraster to convert the estimated values at different soil depths of the grid points into a raster image with the exact resolution rendered by stretching and exporting to a map format to accelerate the mapping process we utilized the modelbuilder tool to model the mapping process and automate data processing stefanidis et al 2021 in addition to account for the accuracy of the spatial estimation we selected swc data from the smap satellite on the same day using gee as a reference cui et al 2017 as the smap soil moisture profile data were in the form of relative water content we transformed the image element values of smap images by multiplying them with the soil fc data to standardize the comparison criteria bordoni et al 2018 the swc spatial trends were relatively consistent across the soil depths showing a trend of high humidity in the north and south and low humidity in the center and west a high degree of consistency with the smap data was observed concerning the overall trends and maize growing areas notably the covariates were acquired from gee thus avoiding the time consuming and laborious operation of downloading extracting and storing remote sensing data a single attribute value of the datum could be acquired in less than 5 min enhancing the data collection and processing efficiency efficient data processing is in line with the development of the gee platform gorelick et al 2017 in addition the review study by amani et al 2020 and tamiminia et al 2020 also showed that many similar studies have benefited from the convenience of gee applications 6 conclusion in this study we proposed a tpe catboost approach for spatial estimation of the swc in china s main maize producing areas this approach improves the optimal hyperparameter configuration of catboost via an efficient tpe algorithm data from 175 swc monitoring stations in these regions were used as the benchmark information on soil physical and chemical properties daily scale meteorological data and the spatial coordinates of each monitoring station were extracted from gee to construct a daily swc multi covariate modeling database from march to october in 2015 2019 the model accuracy was evaluated using the loocv method the results were as follows 1 the most outstanding estimation accuracy at different soil depths was obtained with mae values within 6 06 6 94 and errors increasing with soil depth and the lat ph sbd dem and tdew had the highest mean importance score 2 the annual mae from

spatial interpolation methods idw ok ebk ai algorithms that combined environmental covariates achieved a higher estimation accuracy the proposed tpe catboost model performed well with an improvement

rainfall and minimum mean temperature spatial mapping of the estimation results in the arcgis platform for selected single day data demonstrated high consistency in distribution trends concerning the smap product however the method proposed in this paper still has some shortcomings the utilized swc monitoring stations were located in flat maize fields thus making representation limited in terms of the number of monitoring stations crop types and topographic differences slope gradient and slope aspect furthermore remote sensing based vegetation indicators such as normalized difference vegetation index ndvi leaf area index lai and enhanced vegetation index evi are also correlated with the spatial distribution of swc peng and loew 2017 nevertheless under existing conditions we did not fully access all relevant daily resolution data for the investigated period 2015 2019 via the gee platform therefore in future studies we plan to improve the spatial estimation accuracy of swc by extending

2874,healthy soils are one of the key priorities of the eu soil strategy and soil erosion can present a threat to soils around the world rainfall erosivity is the main driver of soil erosion by water rainfall interception by vegetation can reduce the erosive power of raindrops and consequently measures involving vegetation can mitigate soil erosion losses in this study the effect of rainfall interception on the erosive power of raindrops under the birch tree in an urban park in the city of ljubljana is investigated more than one year of measurements of drop size distribution using two optical disdrometers placed above and below the birch tree canopy were used to investigate the impact of rainfall interception on the erosive power of raindrops the number of drops fall velocity and drop diameter were on average smaller below the canopy in comparison to the measurements above the canopy for 20 7 and 27 respectively this also resulted in a reduction in the rainfall kinetic energy 3 and 30 in the leafless and leafed periods respectively and rainfall erosivity 21 and 50 for the leafless and leafed periods respectively the results demonstrate that rainfall interception has a significant seasonal influence on the erosive power of raindrops therefore vegetation characteristics should be considered as time varying rather than constant parameters in soil erosion modelling

introduction soil erosion is a raising global threat to agriculture and ecology of oceans and rivers borrelli et al 2020 the main drivers of soil erosion are water and wind with water erosion studied more frequently than wind erosion borrelli et al 2021 suggesting that water induced erosion is a major environmental problem worldwide rainfall erosivity as a driver of soil erosion is also characterized by large spatial and temporal variability bezak et al 2021a b c d bezak et al 2021a de luis et al 2010 panagos et al 2016 while climate change is expected to increase the intensity of the most extreme rainfall events burt et al 2016 which cause the majority of soil erosion it is important to understand the interaction between rainfall and vegetation especially because water erosion could increase by up to 50 in the future borrelli et al 2020 this is especially important because some recent studies have already indicated a positive trend in the rainfall erosivity at continental scales bezak et al 2020 therefore nature based measures such as urban parks or other measures that involve the use of vegetation štajdohar et al 2016 yao et al 2015 zabret and šraj 2019a 2015 zeng et al 2021 to cope with flooding and soil erosion will be increasingly applied in the coming decades to reduce the risk of flooding and soil erosion therefore better knowledge of the impact of rainfall interception on rainfall erosivity which is the main driver of soil erosion is needed to effectively design and implement nature based solutions and soil protection measures in the coming decades rainfall interception has a significant influence on the water balance because part of the intercepted rainfall is returned to the atmosphere through evapotranspiration in a relatively short time after the rainfall event while the other part is infiltrated into the soil and potentially recharges groundwater previous studies have demonstrated that tree canopies can intercept notable amounts of rainfall geiger et al 1995 found that deciduous trees intercept between 20 and 25 of rainfall on average in most cases while coniferous trees intercept between 20 and 40 on average for very low magnitude events or for very extreme events the amount of intercepted rainfall can be close to 100 or 0 respectively bezak et al 2018 šraj et al 2008a zabret and šraj 2021a however it should be noted that the amount of intercepted rainfall is not constant and depends significantly on seasonal characteristics e g phenophase and meteorological variables nanko et al 2016 2013 2006 zabret 2013 zabret et al 2018 zabret and šraj 2021a 2019b the microstructure of rainfall i e the number of drops their diameter and fall velocity can help us understand the discrete nature of rainfall which is too often overlooked in soil erosion and rainfall related studies uijlenhoet and sempere torres 2006 zabret et al 2017 this could be a major drawback as many physical processes at the land surface and in the atmosphere are related to the microstructure of rainfall bezak et al 2021c uijlenhoet and sempere torres 2006 zabret et al 2017 rainfall interception by vegetation and soil erosion are two very important processes that are closely related carollo et al 2016 ciaccioni et al 2016 nanko et al 2020 petan et al 2010 zabret et al 2017 rainfall interception by vegetation depends on several factors such as vegetation characteristics e g canopy storage capacity tree crown size vegetation height leaf properties etc and meteorological factors e g wind speed air temperature relative humidity saturation vapour pressure deficit microstructure of rainfall etc nanko et al 2013 nooraei beidokhti and moore 2021 šraj et al 2008a zabret et al 2018 zabret and šraj 2021a although microstructure of rainfall was reported to be among the most influential meteorological variables related to rainfall interception zabret et al 2018 zabret and šraj 2021a the number of raindrops their diameter and fall velocity are still rarely included in the studies in order to obtain the data about rainfall microstructure nowadays optical or laser disdrometers are used which measure the drop size distribution dsd and fall velocity of drops nanko et al 2020 due to the interaction of rainfall with the canopy the process of rainfall interception also influences the kinetic energy and therewith the erosive power of raindrops rainfall erosivity is usually expressed as a function of kinetic energy of raindrops which can be determined using rainfall microstructure measurements there are few studies on rainfall erosivity in the context of rainfall interception e g cao et al 2008 dunkerley 2020 frasson and krajewski 2011 goebes et al 2015 li et al 2019 nanko et al 2011 2016 2020 senn et al 2020 shinohara et al 2018 since high frequency rainfall and throughfall raindrop size distribution dsd data is needed to conduct such a study rainfall interception usually reduces rainfall erosivity e g cao et al 2008 however in some cases leaf dripping can also increase rainfall erosivity li et al 2019 nanko et al 2006 nanko et al 2006 argued that throughfall which consists of three drop components namely free throughfall drips and splash droplets has under calm meteorological conditions different dsds related to the canopy species they also reported that throughfall usually consists of smaller drops in case of severe vibrations as the consequence of high wind speed furthermore goebes 2015 has shown that interception itself can reduce the amount of droplets reaching the ground and thus reduce soil erosion while leaf dripping after the end of the rainfall event can increase the soil erosion soil erosion is an important environmental issue around the globe and has been also recognized within the eu mission a soil deal for europe slovenia is no exception especially because it is among the countries with the highest soil erosion rates in europe panagos et al 2015b one of the reasons for these high soil erosion rates is also high rainfall erosivity which is characteristic for this part of europe bezak et al 2015 panagos et al 2015b therefore the main objective of this study was to investigate the effect of rainfall interception on rainfall erosivity under the birch tree located in an urban park in the capital city of ljubljana slovenia specifically the following scientific questions were investigated i how does the rainfall interception changes the number of drops below the tree canopy compared to measurements above the canopy ii how are the changes in the number of drops fall velocity and drop diameter translated into the rainfall kinetic energy and consequently to the rainfall erosivity iii what is the difference between the leafed and leafless period in terms of kinetic energy and rainfall erosivity below and above the vegetation 2 data and methods 2 1 study site measurements were conducted at a study site in the southwestern part of the city of ljubljana slovenia 46 04 n 14 49 e at 292 m asl zabret et al 2018 2017 zabret and šraj 2021a 2021b 2019a 2019b 2018 the area has subalpine climate with well defined seasons and is characterized by a temperate oceanic climate cfb according to the köppen climate classification system zabret et al 2018 the average air temperature for the area is 10 9 c and the average long term annual precipitation is 1 362 mm arso 2021 the study plot is part of a small urban park with an area of about 600 m2 fig 1 it is flat and covered with regularly cut grass it consists of two groups of trees namely pine trees pinus nigra arnold and birch trees betula pendula roth in the western part and a clearing in the eastern part of the study site in this study we focused only on the birch tree the observed birch tree is 16 2 m high with a diameter at breast height dbh of 18 3 cm and an upward branch inclination of 53 3 zabret and šraj 2021b birch is characterized by four phenoseasons namely leafed leaf fall leafless and leafing phenoseasons were defined based on regular measurements of leaf area index lai measured with the lai 2200 plant canopy analyzer li cor inc at the study site and compared with official data from the slovenian environment agency at the nearest phenological station ljubljana bežigrad arso 2020 given that there were few events section 2 2 in the two shorter periods of leaf fall and leafing we decided to divide the entire period into only two periods namely the leafed period when birch leaves were present and the leafless period when the canopy was without leaves the storage capacity of the observed birch tree in leafed period was estimated by zabret and šraj 2021b to be 3 5 mm and the leaf area index lai to be 2 6 2 2 measurements the research is based on the measurements of rainfall micro structure i e raindrop diameter raindrop velocity and the number of raindrops over the period of 14 months 24 7 2017 24 9 2018 using two laser disdrometers both ott parsivel placed above and below the birch canopy the disdrometer above the canopy was installed on the rooftop of the nearby building having almost the same height as the tree canopies 14 45 m the measuring area of each disdrometer is 54 cm2 and the measured data are automatically classified into one of 32 drop diameter classes ranging from 0 312 mm to 24 5 mm and 32 velocity classes ranging from 0 05 m s to 20 8 m s i e a total of 1024 classes as specified by the world meteorological organization wmo the drop diameters smaller than 0 312 mm which are outside the measuring range of the instrument have been assigned to the smallest drop diameter class disdrometer is capable of distinguishing eight precipitation types i e drizzle drizzle rain rain mixed rain snow snow snow grains sleet hail however in this study we focused only on rain events the high frequency measurement time interval of 1 min was used in the study simultaneously the amount of rainfall was also measured using a tipping bucket 0 2 mm tip rain gauge onset rg2 m with an automatic data logger onset hobo event located in a clearing in the northeast side of the study site fig 1 data from this rain gauge was used for control and comparison of rainfall amount as well as to divide measured precipitation into individual rainfall events 2 3 methods recorded precipitation data was divided into individual rainfall events with at least 6 mm of rain and separated by periods of at least 6 h without rain during which the tree canopies were allowed to dry out the dry time span interval criterion is consistent with the usle type methodology e g universal soil loss equation usle and also with the revised universal soil loss equation rusle e g renard et al 1997 in order to consider a large number of events we decided to use the threshold of 6 mm instead of the 12 7 mm petek et al 2018 performed sensitivity analysis of the usle type methodology input criteria and showed that using lower threshold values can increase the number of events while having up to 5 10 impact on the annual rainfall erosivity the 6 mm threshold was also used in some other studies that focused on the rainfall interception zabret and šraj 2019b considering the presented criteria i e 6 mm threshold 83 events were identified during the measurement period additionally we excluded 21 snow events and 4 events due to malfunction of one of a disdrometers thus a total of 58 rainfall events were defined and included in further analysis of these 40 events occurred during the leafed period and 18 during the leafless period main characteristics of these 58 events are shown in section 3 1 in the next step we calculated the duration and cumulative rainfall amount of individual rainfall events as well as the corresponding number of drops their diameter and their velocity using raw data from disdrometers placed above and below the canopy additionally we calculated the rainfall intensity i dsd kinetic energy of rainfall ke and the rainfall erosivity factor r the r factor was calculated as the product of the ke eq 2 and i30 which represents the maximum 30 minute rainfall intensity during the rainfall event the rainfall intensity i dsd in mm h 1 for each time interval dt 1 60 h derived from raindrop size distribution dsd measurements was calculated as petan et al 2010 1 i d s d π 6 f δ t i n i 1 d b i d a i d a i d b

velocity of class i va i and vb i are velocity classes limits for specific class in m s 1 equation 2 can also be expressed using equation 1 detailed explanation about the applied methodology can be found in petan et al 2010 the methodology and these equations were also used in a recent study that investigated the spatial and temporal variability of rainfall erosivity in slovenia bezak et al 2021c based on the collected and calculated data i e number of drops fall velocity kinetic energy rainfall erosivity descriptive statistics were calculated and violin plots were used for graphical representation additionally level plots were used for the representation of the disdrometer data for the selected events kinetic energy and rainfall erosivity properties are presented in section 3 2 three events were also studied in detail a low medium magnitude event with 35 mm of rainfall above the canopy and rainfall duration of around 20 h september 2017 a medium magnitude event with 63 mm of rainfall above the canopy and rainfall duration of around 38 h november 2017 an extreme event with 90 mm of rainfall above the canopy in around 7 h with a return period of around 25 years august 2018 the selected events also have different ratios of kinetic energy below and above canopy as shown in the results and discussion section 3 results and discussion 3 1 rainfall interception and drop size distribution dsd the total amount of rainfall detected by the disdrometer below the tree canopy was 1 152 mm which corresponds to 69 of rainfall detected by the disdrometer above the canopy 1 669 mm table 1 thus we can conclude that the birch tree canopy intercepted 31 of precipitation during the 58 rainfall events that occurred during the measurement period this value is comparable to the values previously obtained for the same research area but for a different time period and for measurements using tipping bucket instruments bezak et al 2018 šraj et al 2008b zabret et al 2018 zabret and šraj 2018 more specifically for the events in the leafed period the average ratio at event scale between througfall and rainfall above the canopy was 59 with a standard deviation of 13 while in the leafless period this ratio at event scale was on average 69 with a standard deviation of 14 comparison of measured rainfall amount with measurements from a tipping bucket 0 2 mm tip rain gauge onset rg2 m located in the nearby clearing demonstrated that disdrometer overestimated total rainfall depth by around 20 this finding is consistent with the results of some other studies bezak et al 2013 bezak et al 2021c which found that disdrometer overestimated measured rainfall by about 25 this indicates that disdrometer measurements of rainfall can be biased but some of the parameters that can be measured by the disdrometer such as drop fall velocity or diameter can be very useful for the estimation of the kinetic energy one of the possible reasons for this kind of bias could be an overestimation of large drops i e inhomogeneous laser beam tokay et al 2013 a comparison of frequency distribution of measured precipitation and throughfall for the leafless and leafed periods is presented in fig 2 a the throughfall amount measured below the birch canopy was 75 of the precipitation amount during the leafless period and 66 during the leafed period the measured values of throughfall below the birch tree canopy are comparable to the results of previous studies under single isolated trees in urban areas e g staelens et al 2008 xiao et al 2000 xiao and mcpherson 2011 as well as with the results from previous periods for the same research area e g zabret et al 2018 zabret and šraj 2015 however we have to consider the fact that rainfall interception is influenced by climatological conditions which vary from year to year zabret and šraj 2021a the average rainfall intensity calculated using eq 1 above the tree canopy for all considered rainfall events was 2 93 mm h while this value below the tree canopy was 1 64 mm h as we can see the intensity of precipitation decreased by 44 on average after it passed the tree canopy moreover at the event scale the average rainfall intensity below the canopy was 55 and 72 of the average intensity above the canopy for the leafed and leafless periods respectively i e with a standard deviation of 16 in both cases the results show that precipitation intensity changes to a lesser extent after passing through the birch canopy during the leafless period fig 2b which can be regarded as an expected result during the observation period the disdrometer detected 162 899 drops per event on average above the tree canopy and 129 567 drops per event below it table 1 the results demonstrate that on average 20 fewer drops were detected below the tree canopy than above the decrease in the number of drops was more pronounced in the leafless period 34 than in the leafed period 10 which is also demonstrated in fig 3 a where a frequency distribution of the number of raindrops above and below the canopy in both periods is presented it should be noted that the total number of raindrops above the canopy was higher in the leafless period compared to the leafed period table 1 and fig 3a while opposite results were observed for drop diameter and drop velocity table 1 fig 3b and 3c moreover the detected number of drops can be also affected by the micro location of the disdrometer beneath the tree canopy e g directly under a branch since the measuring area of a disdrometer is only 54 cm2 this should be considered as a point measurement while the spatial distribution of throughfall and drop characteristics under the canopy can vary considerably zabret and šraj 2018 hence splashing and dripping below the canopy was more pronounced and uniformly distributed in leafed period i e leaf area index in leafed period is about 2 5 zabret and šraj 2019a as drop diameter and drop velocity were also smaller below the canopy than above the canopy table 1 fig 3b and 3c on the other hand in the leafless period there is no interception by leaves while branches can intercept raindrops it should be noted that stemflow in leafless period was higher compared to the stemflow in leafed period zabret and šraj 2019a thus it appears that in the leafless period larger percentage of raindrops was intercepted as stemflow compared to the leafed period which resulted in the reduction of the number of raindrops below the canopy however collecting and analysing additional rainfall events both in leafed and leafless period could confirm the reported relationships between the number of events above and below the tree canopy in the leafless and leafed periods as the number of events is strongly related to the characteristics of the individual rainfall events the decrease in the number of drops below the canopy of european beech was also reported by lüpke et al 2019 for most of the rainfall events analysed however there were some individual events with higher number of drops below the canopy they indicated that the specific characteristics of drop size distribution can vary significantly even during the individual event li et al 2019 also reported a 16 decrease in the number of rainfall drops below the canopy of pinus massoniana lamb forest the detected number of drops has a direct impact on soil erosion because each raindrop especially large raindrops can cause soil detachment gilley and finker 1985 however besides the number of drops itself the fall velocity and the drop diameter are the two parameters that control soil detachment gilley and finker 1985 raindrop diameters and velocities were generally higher above the canopy than below the canopy throughout the observation period fig 3b and 3c the average diameter of raindrops above the tree canopy ranged between 0 54 mm and 1 26 mm during the measurement period on average the drop diameter was 0 92 mm table 1 on the other hand the average diameter of raindrops under the birch canopy ranged from 0 56 mm to 0 77 mm with an average of 0 67 mm table 1 representing a 27 decrease compared to the average diameter of the drops above the tree canopy the results in table 1 and fig 3b show that the average diameter of raindrops passing through the birch tree canopy decreased both during the leafless by 14 and leafed by 31 period however droplets retain their size under the canopy during the leafless period to a greater extent than during the leafed period fig 3b this is an expected result as birch is a deciduous tree which means that rainfall interception during the leafless period is lower also nanko et al 2016 who measured throughfall drop size distributions below the yellow poplar reported that vegetation period is one of the most influential factors controlling throughfall dsd they reported that the leafless period had larger sized throughfall drops originating from canopy drip than the leafed period furthermore nanko et al 2006 indicated that different tree species generated different sizes of throughfall droplets during the same rainfall event as the consequence of the difference in leaf size and shape among tree species additionally nanko et al 2013 demonstrated that throughfall dsd differs between tree species especially in terms of maximum drop diameter and range of drop diameter this was also confirmed by lüpke et al 2019 who argued that throughfall spectra depends on both tree species and rain event characteristics they reported a wider diameter range for intense events and a narrower diameter range for lower intensity events as raindrop velocity is directly related to the raindrop diameter the results for the raindrop velocity are very similar fig 3c according to some previous research see mineo et al 2019 drop velocity strongly depends on the drop diameter for diameters less than 4 mm while the dependency attenuates for drop diameters ranging from 4 to 6 mm as the average drop diameter during the measurement period was about 1 mm a strong relationship between mean drop diameter and mean drop velocity was expected especially in case of measurements above the canopy an exponential dependence was found between the two variables in both the leafed pearson correlation coefficient 0 88 and leafless pearson correlation coefficient 0 99 periods in case of measurements below the tree canopy a relatively high dependence was also observed in the leafless period pearson correlation coefficient 0 93 while no dependence was found in the leafed period pearson correlation coefficient 0 08 as expected the dependence of drop diameter and drop velocity was stronger in the leafless period and the dependency is quite similar above and below the tree canopy we also evaluated the performance of the equation proposed by carollo and ferro 2015 carollo et al 2016 for estimating terminal velocity based on measured drop diameter with respect to the relationship between leafless pearson correlation coefficient was 0 98 and 0 92 above and below the canopy respectively and leafed pearson correlation coefficient was 0 88 and 0 09 above and below the canopy respectively periods and measurements above and below the canopy similar conclusions can be drawn as in the case of measured average drop diameter and drop velocity during the period of measurements the average velocity of raindrops per event above the birch canopy varied between 2 99 m s and 4 77 m s the average velocity of the drops per event was 4 06 m s the average velocity of raindrops below the birch canopy ranged from 3 45 m s to 3 99 m s averaging 3 76 m s which is 7 lower compared to the average velocity of droplets above the tree canopy lower velocity of throughfall drops was also reported by nanko et al 2020 who argued that a decrease in velocity can be attributed to the insufficient fall distance from the canopy to the floor to reach terminal velocity the average velocity of raindrops decreased when passing through the birch canopy both during the leafless less than 1 and leafed by 10 periods which followed the results of the raindrop diameters thus it is clear that rainfall interception not only affects the number of drops reaching the ground i e an average decrease of 20 but also decreases fall velocity i e an average decrease of 7 and drop diameter i e an average decrease of 27 these numbers also indicate that the corresponding kinetic energy and rainfall erosivity should be lower below the tree canopy compared to the characteristics in the open 3 2 kinetic energy and rainfall erosivity the rainfall kinetic energy derived from the raindrop size distribution dsd measurements using eq 2 ranged from 0 28 mj ha to 15 4 mj ha the results presented in fig 4 a indicate that the kinetic energy of raindrops was maintained during the leafless period as they passed through the canopy the difference was 3 while it decreased by an average of 30 during the leafed period similar can also be observed for the rainfall erosivity factor r which largely depends on the duration of the event the size and velocity of the raindrops as well as the phenophase it should be noted that ke and r are closely related i e r ke i30 however r factor is often used by the usle type soil erosion models such as usle rusle or rusle2 as we can see from fig 4b the rainfall erosivity factor r decreased by 21 and 50 on average after the raindrops passed the canopy during the leafless and leafed periods respectively thus we can conclude that the birch canopy during the leafed period reduced the erosivity factor r by 29 compared to the leafless period the ratio between rainfall erosivity factor r above and below the tree canopy ranged from 0 3 to 15 0 both extreme values were determined in the leafed period fig 5 moreover it can be found that the average ratio between r above and below the tree canopy is 63 lower in the leafless period than in the leafed period fig 5 the seasonal variation of the ratio between rainfall erosivity above and below the tree canopy is shown in fig 6 a the ratio was less than 1 i e rainfall interception did not decrease rainfall erosivity for only 4 precipitation events 2 in leafless and 2 in leafed period more specifically these four events can be explained by an increase in rainfall erosivity due to dropping of larger drops or multiple smaller drops from the canopy during and after the event table 2 fig 6 these four events all had more than 12 mm of rainfall which means that the storage canopy capacity was exceeded zabret and šraj 2021a it is clear that the summer months are characterized by larger rainfall erosivity the rainfall events also have a higher average rainfall intensity fig 6b and rainfall interception leads to a more significant decrease in the rainfall erosivity fig 6a fig 7 shows an example of a medium magnitude event with ratio of rainfall erosivity above and below the canopy smaller than 1 that occurred in november 2017 during the leafless period table 2 as we can see the drop size distribution is fairly even throughout the event both above and below the canopy hence also the average drop diameter and average drop velocity are relatively similar above and below the canopy table 2 rainfall erosivity below the canopy i e around 10 was slightly higher than rainfall erosivity above the tree canopy i e around 50 mj mm ha 1 h 1 a similar relationship can be seen for the rainfall kinetic energy table 2 while i30 values are relatively similar below and above the canopy i e around 7 7 mm h on the other hand fig 8 shows an example of a low medium magnitude rainfall event that occurred in september 2017 during the leafed period the number of raindrops detected during this event was obviously much larger above the canopy than below it fig 8 rainfall erosivity above the canopy was about 2 times higher than the rainfall erosivity below the canopy i e 15 mj mm ha 1 h 1 table 2 the kinetic energy above the canopy was also higher than below the canopy although the difference was not very significant table 2 in case of this event also the i30 below the canopy was around 40 lower compared to intensity above the canopy which was equal to around 7 7 mm h table 2 thus the vegetation intercepted a large portion of the raindrops and reduced their kinetic energy and rainfall intensities i e i30 especially compared to the leafless period and the rainfall event that is shown in fig 7 where there was almost no reduction in i30 it should be noted that the mean i30 above and below the canopy is equal to 18 mm h and 12 5 mm h respectively while the maximum values of the i30 for the detected rainfall events are equal to 78 mm h and 105 mm h below and above the canopy respectively hence it can be seen that specific ratios between rainfall intensities kinetic energy and consequently of the erosive power of raindrops depend on characteristics of rainfall event and can vary significantly from one event to another furthermore a detailed analysis of the extreme magnitude rainfall event with a kinetic energy of 15 4 mj ha was also conducted table 2 fig 9 the event was recorded on august 14 2018 when a summer storm occurred the event had the highest kinetic energy among all 58 events considered above and below the tree canopy it lasted for 7 1 h during this time 90 7 mm of rain fell above the birch canopy and 60 7 mm was recorded below it the rainfall intensity was 12 mm h and the throughfall intensity was 8 mm h raindrops above the canopy with an average diameter of 1 1 mm reached an average drop velocity of 4 5 m s while the average diameter of raindrops below the canopy decreased to 0 7 mm and drop velocity to 3 6 m s table 2 the kinetic energy of the event decreased from 15 4 mj ha above the tree canopy to 9 8 mj ha below it which is 36 the rainfall erosivity factor r was 1632 mj mm ha 1 h 1 above the tree canopy and decreased to 769 mj mm ha 1 h 1 below it in this case rainfall interception by the tree canopy reduced the rainfall erosivity factor by 53 moreover it can be seen that during the extreme event which occurred in leafed period the interception by vegetation lead to a lagged dripping from leaves after the peak rainfall intensity above the canopy fig 9 moreover the rainfall erosivity of this event can be regarded as relatively extreme and is within the range of the annual rainfall erosivity at some european locations e g parts of central or eastern europe panagos et al 2015a furthermore for the entire period of measurements used in this study this specific event contributed to around 22 of the total rainfall erosivity which was equal to around 7 200 mj mm ha h the total recorded rainfall erosivity can be regarded as relatively extreme but it should be noted that it includes two summer seasons hence this is in accordance to the results presented by bezak et al 2021 who showed that around 5 10 events are needed to account for 50 of the annual rainfall erosivity at this part of europe bezak et al 2021 also showed that inequality described with gini coefficient in slovenia is among the highest in europe on the other hand fig 7 and fig 8 present two examples of low to medium intensity rainfall events that are associated with much smaller rainfall erosivity values compared to the summer event that is shown in fig 9 these findings are consistent with the results of previous studies for example cao et al 2008 reported that erosivity is reduced mainly by rainfall interception on the other hand some authors goebes 2015 nanko et al 2020 2006 indicated that leaf dripping may also increase rainfall erosivity in some cases li et al 2019 found that kinetic energy below the canopy of pinus massoniana lamb forest is reduced at higher rainfall intensity and the effect is reversed at lower rainfall intensity 3 3 connection of the rainfall interception impact to usle type methodology in the scope of the usle type methodology renard et al 1997 the vegetation effect is considered using the dimensionless crop cover and management factor c thus different values for the crop cover and management factor can be found in the literature for a given land use type bezak et al 2015 esetlili et al 2014 panagos et al 2015b renard et al 1997 for example thapa 2020 used a value of 0 03 for forest and a value of 0 45 for bare land and 0 01 for grassland on the other hand bezak et al 2015 used a value of 0 002 for forest and a value of 0 004 for pastures other studies also report different values for the crop cover and management factor and most studies do not distinguish between forest types e g deciduous and coniferous tree species thus it is clear that such assessments have a high degree of subjectivity while most studies apply a constant value of the crop cover and management factor for soil erosion calculations bezak et al 2015 esetlili et al 2014 thapa 2020 it is clear that the effect of vegetation depends on numerous meteorological factors and vegetation characteristics as shown in this study therefore the use of a constant value of factor c in the context of soil erosion assessments using the usle type methodology may lead to uncertain results it should be noted that the rusle manual provides detailed description of how time varying parameters should be calculated e g half month values renard et al 1997 therefore additional investigations using high frequency measurements below and above different vegetation species should be conducted to evaluate the accuracy of soil erosion calculations using the usle type methodology and to estimate the potential error in cases where a constant value of parameter c is used in the calculations therefore the soil erosion modelling community bezak et al 2021b borrelli et al 2021 should focus on better and more frequent consideration of varying or seasonal dependent dimensionless crop cover and management factor and more precise estimation of rainfall erosivity it should be noted that nearing et al 2017 have pointed out that the empirical equations used by rusle to estimate rainfall erosivity may underestimate erosivity while providing a reasonable estimate of the spatial or temporal differences in erosivity hence the use of the original usle or rusle2 energy equation is suggested nearing et al 2017 moreover it should also be noted that rainfall erosivity is an empirically based index and that actual soil erosion rates depend on numerous factors nearing et al 2017 for example nearing et al 2017 pointed out that kinetic energy of raindrops is not the driving force behind the rill erosion in some cases additionally one should be aware that there are several limitations related to the usle type models as discussed by alewell et al 2019 nevertheless usle type models are the most commonly applied for soil erosion assessment worldwide borrelli et al 2021 4 conclusions this study presents the results of 14 month measurements using optical disdrometers placed below and above the birch tree canopy in an urban park in ljubljana slovenia based on the results presented it can be concluded that i rainfall interception by birch yielded a decrease in the number of raindrops fall velocity and their diameter below the canopy compared to the rainfall in the open the average decrease in these characteristics for the 58 rainfall events was 20 7 and 27 for the number of drops fall velocity and drop diameter respectively ii this also resulted in reduced kinetic energy of rainfall that was not intercepted by the canopy and consequently reduced rainfall erosivity in general moreover the differences between the kinetic energy 3 and 30 in the leafless and leafed periods respectively and rainfall erosivity 21 and 50 for the leafless and leafed periods respectively below and above the tree canopy can be considered significant and are clearly not constant throughout the year but depends on seasonal characteristics meteorological conditions and vegetation properties therefore the decrease in the rainfall erosivity due to rainfall interception can vary significantly from one rainfall event to another moreover it was shown that few events can contribute to the majority of the annual rainfall erosivity this indicates that high inequality exists in the magnitudes of erosive rainfall events iii there was a clear difference in the number of drops fall velocity drop diameter kinetic energy and rainfall erosivity in the leafless and leafed periods for example the average ratio between r above and below the tree canopy is 63 lower in the leafless period than in the leafed period therefore it is clear that vegetation cover such as trees have an important effect on the reduction of the kinetic energy of raindrops hitting the soil and thus on soil erosion rates by reducing rainfall erosivity therefore nature based solutions that involve vegetation such as trees not only have a positive impact on the microclimate flood risk control but also have a significant impact on reducing the kinetic energy of rainfall and thus soil erosion this is especially important as climate change is expected to increase the intensity of the most extreme rainfall events and trees could be used to cope with potential increase in soil erosion rates in the coming decades moreover soil erosion modelling community should more frequently apply time varying crop management factor rather than using constant factor in relation to applying usle type models more detailed investigations regarding the drop size distribution characteristics will be performed in future since the experimental plot in the city of ljubljana was upgraded with measurements of drop size distribution characteristics also below the pine tree canopy authors contributions a zore data validation data analysis results interpretation n bezak formulation of the aims of the study

2874,healthy soils are one of the key priorities of the eu soil strategy and soil erosion can present a threat to soils around the world rainfall erosivity is the main driver of soil erosion by water rainfall interception by vegetation can reduce the erosive power of raindrops and consequently measures involving vegetation can mitigate soil erosion losses in this study the effect of rainfall interception on the erosive power of raindrops under the birch tree in an urban park in the city of ljubljana is investigated more than one year of measurements of drop size distribution using two optical disdrometers placed above and below the birch tree canopy were used to investigate the impact of rainfall interception on the erosive power of raindrops the number of drops fall velocity and drop diameter were on average smaller below the canopy in comparison to the measurements above the canopy for 20 7 and 27 respectively this also resulted in a reduction in the rainfall kinetic energy 3 and 30 in the leafless and leafed periods respectively and rainfall erosivity 21 and 50 for the leafless and leafed periods respectively the results demonstrate that rainfall interception has a significant seasonal influence on the erosive power of raindrops therefore vegetation characteristics should be considered as time varying rather than constant parameters in soil erosion modelling

introduction soil erosion is a raising global threat to agriculture and ecology of oceans and rivers borrelli et al 2020 the main drivers of soil erosion are water and wind with water erosion studied more frequently than wind erosion borrelli et al 2021 suggesting that water induced erosion is a major environmental problem worldwide rainfall erosivity as a driver of soil erosion is also characterized by large spatial and temporal variability bezak et al 2021a b c d bezak et al 2021a de luis et al 2010 panagos et al 2016 while climate change is expected to increase the intensity of the most extreme rainfall events burt et al 2016 which cause the majority of soil erosion it is important to understand the interaction between rainfall and vegetation especially because water erosion could increase by up to 50 in the future borrelli et al 2020 this is especially important because some recent studies have already indicated a positive trend in the rainfall erosivity at continental scales bezak et al 2020 therefore nature based measures such as urban parks or other measures that involve the use of vegetation štajdohar et al 2016 yao et al 2015 zabret and šraj 2019a 2015 zeng et al 2021 to cope with flooding and soil erosion will be increasingly applied in the coming decades to reduce the risk of flooding and soil erosion therefore better knowledge of the impact of rainfall interception on rainfall erosivity which is the main driver of soil erosion is needed to effectively design and implement nature based solutions and soil protection measures in the coming decades rainfall interception has a significant influence on the water balance because part of the intercepted rainfall is returned to the atmosphere through evapotranspiration in a relatively short time after the rainfall event while the other part is infiltrated into the soil and potentially recharges groundwater previous studies have demonstrated that tree canopies can intercept notable amounts of rainfall geiger et al 1995 found that deciduous trees intercept between 20 and 25 of rainfall on average in most cases while coniferous trees intercept between 20 and 40 on average for very low magnitude events or for very extreme events the amount of intercepted rainfall can be close to 100 or 0 respectively bezak et al 2018 šraj et al 2008a zabret and šraj 2021a however it should be noted that the amount of intercepted rainfall is not constant and depends significantly on seasonal characteristics e g phenophase and meteorological variables nanko et al 2016 2013 2006 zabret 2013 zabret et al 2018 zabret and šraj 2021a 2019b the microstructure of rainfall i e the number of drops their diameter and fall velocity can help us understand the discrete nature of rainfall which is too often overlooked in soil erosion and rainfall related studies uijlenhoet and sempere torres 2006 zabret et al 2017 this could be a major drawback as many physical processes at the land surface and in the atmosphere are related to the microstructure of rainfall bezak et al 2021c uijlenhoet and sempere torres 2006 zabret et al 2017 rainfall interception by vegetation and soil erosion are two very important processes that are closely related carollo et al 2016 ciaccioni et al 2016 nanko et al 2020 petan et al 2010 zabret et al 2017 rainfall interception by vegetation depends on several factors such as vegetation characteristics e g canopy storage capacity tree crown size vegetation height leaf properties etc and meteorological factors e g wind speed air temperature relative humidity saturation vapour pressure deficit microstructure of rainfall etc nanko et al 2013 nooraei beidokhti and moore 2021 šraj et al 2008a zabret et al 2018 zabret and šraj 2021a although microstructure of rainfall was reported to be among the most influential meteorological variables related to rainfall interception zabret et al 2018 zabret and šraj 2021a the number of raindrops their diameter and fall velocity are still rarely included in the studies in order to obtain the data about rainfall microstructure nowadays optical or laser disdrometers are used which measure the drop size distribution dsd and fall velocity of drops nanko et al 2020 due to the interaction of rainfall with the canopy the process of rainfall interception also influences the kinetic energy and therewith the erosive power of raindrops rainfall erosivity is usually expressed as a function of kinetic energy of raindrops which can be determined using rainfall microstructure measurements there are few studies on rainfall erosivity in the context of rainfall interception e g cao et al 2008 dunkerley 2020 frasson and krajewski 2011 goebes et al 2015 li et al 2019 nanko et al 2011 2016 2020 senn et al 2020 shinohara et al 2018 since high frequency rainfall and throughfall raindrop size distribution dsd data is needed to conduct such a study rainfall interception usually reduces rainfall erosivity e g cao et al 2008 however in some cases leaf dripping can also increase rainfall erosivity li et al 2019 nanko et al 2006 nanko et al 2006 argued that throughfall which consists of three drop components namely free throughfall drips and splash droplets has under calm meteorological conditions different dsds related to the canopy species they also reported that throughfall usually consists of smaller drops in case of severe vibrations as the consequence of high wind speed furthermore goebes 2015 has shown that interception itself can reduce the amount of droplets reaching the ground and thus reduce soil erosion while leaf dripping after the end of the rainfall event can increase the soil erosion soil erosion is an important environmental issue around the globe and has been also recognized within the eu mission a soil deal for europe slovenia is no exception especially because it is among the countries with the highest soil erosion rates in europe panagos et al 2015b one of the reasons for these high soil erosion rates is also high rainfall erosivity which is characteristic for this part of europe bezak et al 2015 panagos et al 2015b therefore the main objective of this study was to investigate the effect of rainfall interception on rainfall erosivity under the birch tree located in an urban park in the capital city of ljubljana slovenia specifically the following scientific questions were investigated i how does the rainfall interception changes the number of drops below the tree canopy compared to measurements above the canopy ii how are the changes in the number of drops fall velocity and drop diameter translated into the rainfall kinetic energy and consequently to the rainfall erosivity iii what is the difference between the leafed and leafless period in terms of kinetic energy and rainfall erosivity below and above the vegetation 2 data and methods 2 1 study site measurements were conducted at a study site in the southwestern part of the city of ljubljana slovenia 46 04 n 14 49 e at 292 m asl zabret et al 2018 2017 zabret and šraj 2021a 2021b 2019a 2019b 2018 the area has subalpine climate with well defined seasons and is characterized by a temperate oceanic climate cfb according to the köppen climate classification system zabret et al 2018 the average air temperature for the area is 10 9 c and the average long term annual precipitation is 1 362 mm arso 2021 the study plot is part of a small urban park with an area of about 600 m2 fig 1 it is flat and covered with regularly cut grass it consists of two groups of trees namely pine trees pinus nigra arnold and birch trees betula pendula roth in the western part and a clearing in the eastern part of the study site in this study we focused only on the birch tree the observed birch tree is 16 2 m high with a diameter at breast height dbh of 18 3 cm and an upward branch inclination of 53 3 zabret and šraj 2021b birch is characterized by four phenoseasons namely leafed leaf fall leafless and leafing phenoseasons were defined based on regular measurements of leaf area index lai measured with the lai 2200 plant canopy analyzer li cor inc at the study site and compared with official data from the slovenian environment agency at the nearest phenological station ljubljana bežigrad arso 2020 given that there were few events section 2 2 in the two shorter periods of leaf fall and leafing we decided to divide the entire period into only two periods namely the leafed period when birch leaves were present and the leafless period when the canopy was without leaves the storage capacity of the observed birch tree in leafed period was estimated by zabret and šraj 2021b to be 3 5 mm and the leaf area index lai to be 2 6 2 2 measurements the research is based on the measurements of rainfall micro structure i e raindrop diameter raindrop velocity and the number of raindrops over the period of 14 months 24 7 2017 24 9 2018 using two laser disdrometers both ott parsivel placed above and below the birch canopy the disdrometer above the canopy was installed on the rooftop of the nearby building having almost the same height as the tree canopies 14 45 m the measuring area of each disdrometer is 54 cm2 and the measured data are automatically classified into one of 32 drop diameter classes ranging from 0 312 mm to 24 5 mm and 32 velocity classes ranging from 0 05 m s to 20 8 m s i e a total of 1024 classes as specified by the world meteorological organization wmo the drop diameters smaller than 0 312 mm which are outside the measuring range of the instrument have been assigned to the smallest drop diameter class disdrometer is capable of distinguishing eight precipitation types i e drizzle drizzle rain rain mixed rain snow snow snow grains sleet hail however in this study we focused only on rain events the high frequency measurement time interval of 1 min was used in the study simultaneously the amount of rainfall was also measured using a tipping bucket 0 2 mm tip rain gauge onset rg2 m with an automatic data logger onset hobo event located in a clearing in the northeast side of the study site fig 1 data from this rain gauge was used for control and comparison of rainfall amount as well as to divide measured precipitation into individual rainfall events 2 3 methods recorded precipitation data was divided into individual rainfall events with at least 6 mm of rain and separated by periods of at least 6 h without rain during which the tree canopies were allowed to dry out the dry time span interval criterion is consistent with the usle type methodology e g universal soil loss equation usle and also with the revised universal soil loss equation rusle e g renard et al 1997 in order to consider a large number of events we decided to use the threshold of 6 mm instead of the 12 7 mm petek et al 2018 performed sensitivity analysis of the usle type methodology input criteria and showed that using lower threshold values can increase the number of events while having up to 5 10 impact on the annual rainfall erosivity the 6 mm threshold was also used in some other studies that focused on the rainfall interception zabret and šraj 2019b considering the presented criteria i e 6 mm threshold 83 events were identified during the measurement period additionally we excluded 21 snow events and 4 events due to malfunction of one of a disdrometers thus a total of 58 rainfall events were defined and included in further analysis of these 40 events occurred during the leafed period and 18 during the leafless period main characteristics of these 58 events are shown in section 3 1 in the next step we calculated the duration and cumulative rainfall amount of individual rainfall events as well as the corresponding number of drops their diameter and their velocity using raw data from disdrometers placed above and below the canopy additionally we calculated the rainfall intensity i dsd kinetic energy of rainfall ke and the rainfall erosivity factor r the r factor was calculated as the product of the ke eq 2 and i30 which represents the maximum 30 minute rainfall intensity during the rainfall event the rainfall intensity i dsd in mm h 1 for each time interval dt 1 60 h derived from raindrop size distribution dsd measurements was calculated as petan et al 2010 1 i d s d π 6 f δ t i n i 1 d b i d a i d a i d b

velocity of class i va i and vb i are velocity classes limits for specific class in m s 1 equation 2 can also be expressed using equation 1 detailed explanation about the applied methodology can be found in petan et al 2010 the methodology and these equations were also used in a recent study that investigated the spatial and temporal variability of rainfall erosivity in slovenia bezak et al 2021c based on the collected and calculated data i e number of drops fall velocity kinetic energy rainfall erosivity descriptive statistics were calculated and violin plots were used for graphical representation additionally level plots were used for the representation of the disdrometer data for the selected events kinetic energy and rainfall erosivity properties are presented in section 3 2 three events were also studied in detail a low medium magnitude event with 35 mm of rainfall above the canopy and rainfall duration of around 20 h september 2017 a medium magnitude event with 63 mm of rainfall above the canopy and rainfall duration of around 38 h november 2017 an extreme event with 90 mm of rainfall above the canopy in around 7 h with a return period of around 25 years august 2018 the selected events also have different ratios of kinetic energy below and above canopy as shown in the results and discussion section 3 results and discussion 3 1 rainfall interception and drop size distribution dsd the total amount of rainfall detected by the disdrometer below the tree canopy was 1 152 mm which corresponds to 69 of rainfall detected by the disdrometer above the canopy 1 669 mm table 1 thus we can conclude that the birch tree canopy intercepted 31 of precipitation during the 58 rainfall events that occurred during the measurement period this value is comparable to the values previously obtained for the same research area but for a different time period and for measurements using tipping bucket instruments bezak et al 2018 šraj et al 2008b zabret et al 2018 zabret and šraj 2018 more specifically for the events in the leafed period the average ratio at event scale between througfall and rainfall above the canopy was 59 with a standard deviation of 13 while in the leafless period this ratio at event scale was on average 69 with a standard deviation of 14 comparison of measured rainfall amount with measurements from a tipping bucket 0 2 mm tip rain gauge onset rg2 m located in the nearby clearing demonstrated that disdrometer overestimated total rainfall depth by around 20 this finding is consistent with the results of some other studies bezak et al 2013 bezak et al 2021c which found that disdrometer overestimated measured rainfall by about 25 this indicates that disdrometer measurements of rainfall can be biased but some of the parameters that can be measured by the disdrometer such as drop fall velocity or diameter can be very useful for the estimation of the kinetic energy one of the possible reasons for this kind of bias could be an overestimation of large drops i e inhomogeneous laser beam tokay et al 2013 a comparison of frequency distribution of measured precipitation and throughfall for the leafless and leafed periods is presented in fig 2 a the throughfall amount measured below the birch canopy was 75 of the precipitation amount during the leafless period and 66 during the leafed period the measured values of throughfall below the birch tree canopy are comparable to the results of previous studies under single isolated trees in urban areas e g staelens et al 2008 xiao et al 2000 xiao and mcpherson 2011 as well as with the results from previous periods for the same research area e g zabret et al 2018 zabret and šraj 2015 however we have to consider the fact that rainfall interception is influenced by climatological conditions which vary from year to year zabret and šraj 2021a the average rainfall intensity calculated using eq 1 above the tree canopy for all considered rainfall events was 2 93 mm h while this value below the tree canopy was 1 64 mm h as we can see the intensity of precipitation decreased by 44 on average after it passed the tree canopy moreover at the event scale the average rainfall intensity below the canopy was 55 and 72 of the average intensity above the canopy for the leafed and leafless periods respectively i e with a standard deviation of 16 in both cases the results show that precipitation intensity changes to a lesser extent after passing through the birch canopy during the leafless period fig 2b which can be regarded as an expected result during the observation period the disdrometer detected 162 899 drops per event on average above the tree canopy and 129 567 drops per event below it table 1 the results demonstrate that on average 20 fewer drops were detected below the tree canopy than above the decrease in the number of drops was more pronounced in the leafless period 34 than in the leafed period 10 which is also demonstrated in fig 3 a where a frequency distribution of the number of raindrops above and below the canopy in both periods is presented it should be noted that the total number of raindrops above the canopy was higher in the leafless period compared to the leafed period table 1 and fig 3a while opposite results were observed for drop diameter and drop velocity table 1 fig 3b and 3c moreover the detected number of drops can be also affected by the micro location of the disdrometer beneath the tree canopy e g directly under a branch since the measuring area of a disdrometer is only 54 cm2 this should be considered as a point measurement while the spatial distribution of throughfall and drop characteristics under the canopy can vary considerably zabret and šraj 2018 hence splashing and dripping below the canopy was more pronounced and uniformly distributed in leafed period i e leaf area index in leafed period is about 2 5 zabret and šraj 2019a as drop diameter and drop velocity were also smaller below the canopy than above the canopy table 1 fig 3b and 3c on the other hand in the leafless period there is no interception by leaves while branches can intercept raindrops it should be noted that stemflow in leafless period was higher compared to the stemflow in leafed period zabret and šraj 2019a thus it appears that in the leafless period larger percentage of raindrops was intercepted as stemflow compared to the leafed period which resulted in the reduction of the number of raindrops below the canopy however collecting and analysing additional rainfall events both in leafed and leafless period could confirm the reported relationships between the number of events above and below the tree canopy in the leafless and leafed periods as the number of events is strongly related to the characteristics of the individual rainfall events the decrease in the number of drops below the canopy of european beech was also reported by lüpke et al 2019 for most of the rainfall events analysed however there were some individual events with higher number of drops below the canopy they indicated that the specific characteristics of drop size distribution can vary significantly even during the individual event li et al 2019 also reported a 16 decrease in the number of rainfall drops below the canopy of pinus massoniana lamb forest the detected number of drops has a direct impact on soil erosion because each raindrop especially large raindrops can cause soil detachment gilley and finker 1985 however besides the number of drops itself the fall velocity and the drop diameter are the two parameters that control soil detachment gilley and finker 1985 raindrop diameters and velocities were generally higher above the canopy than below the canopy throughout the observation period fig 3b and 3c the average diameter of raindrops above the tree canopy ranged between 0 54 mm and 1 26 mm during the measurement period on average the drop diameter was 0 92 mm table 1 on the other hand the average diameter of raindrops under the birch canopy ranged from 0 56 mm to 0 77 mm with an average of 0 67 mm table 1 representing a 27 decrease compared to the average diameter of the drops above the tree canopy the results in table 1 and fig 3b show that the average diameter of raindrops passing through the birch tree canopy decreased both during the leafless by 14 and leafed by 31 period however droplets retain their size under the canopy during the leafless period to a greater extent than during the leafed period fig 3b this is an expected result as birch is a deciduous tree which means that rainfall interception during the leafless period is lower also nanko et al 2016 who measured throughfall drop size distributions below the yellow poplar reported that vegetation period is one of the most influential factors controlling throughfall dsd they reported that the leafless period had larger sized throughfall drops originating from canopy drip than the leafed period furthermore nanko et al 2006 indicated that different tree species generated different sizes of throughfall droplets during the same rainfall event as the consequence of the difference in leaf size and shape among tree species additionally nanko et al 2013 demonstrated that throughfall dsd differs between tree species especially in terms of maximum drop diameter and range of drop diameter this was also confirmed by lüpke et al 2019 who argued that throughfall spectra depends on both tree species and rain event characteristics they reported a wider diameter range for intense events and a narrower diameter range for lower intensity events as raindrop velocity is directly related to the raindrop diameter the results for the raindrop velocity are very similar fig 3c according to some previous research see mineo et al 2019 drop velocity strongly depends on the drop diameter for diameters less than 4 mm while the dependency attenuates for drop diameters ranging from 4 to 6 mm as the average drop diameter during the measurement period was about 1 mm a strong relationship between mean drop diameter and mean drop velocity was expected especially in case of measurements above the canopy an exponential dependence was found between the two variables in both the leafed pearson correlation coefficient 0 88 and leafless pearson correlation coefficient 0 99 periods in case of measurements below the tree canopy a relatively high dependence was also observed in the leafless period pearson correlation coefficient 0 93 while no dependence was found in the leafed period pearson correlation coefficient 0 08 as expected the dependence of drop diameter and drop velocity was stronger in the leafless period and the dependency is quite similar above and below the tree canopy we also evaluated the performance of the equation proposed by carollo and ferro 2015 carollo et al 2016 for estimating terminal velocity based on measured drop diameter with respect to the relationship between leafless pearson correlation coefficient was 0 98 and 0 92 above and below the canopy respectively and leafed pearson correlation coefficient was 0 88 and 0 09 above and below the canopy respectively periods and measurements above and below the canopy similar conclusions can be drawn as in the case of measured average drop diameter and drop velocity during the period of measurements the average velocity of raindrops per event above the birch canopy varied between 2 99 m s and 4 77 m s the average velocity of the drops per event was 4 06 m s the average velocity of raindrops below the birch canopy ranged from 3 45 m s to 3 99 m s averaging 3 76 m s which is 7 lower compared to the average velocity of droplets above the tree canopy lower velocity of throughfall drops was also reported by nanko et al 2020 who argued that a decrease in velocity can be attributed to the insufficient fall distance from the canopy to the floor to reach terminal velocity the average velocity of raindrops decreased when passing through the birch canopy both during the leafless less than 1 and leafed by 10 periods which followed the results of the raindrop diameters thus it is clear that rainfall interception not only affects the number of drops reaching the ground i e an average decrease of 20 but also decreases fall velocity i e an average decrease of 7 and drop diameter i e an average decrease of 27 these numbers also indicate that the corresponding kinetic energy and rainfall erosivity should be lower below the tree canopy compared to the characteristics in the open 3 2 kinetic energy and rainfall erosivity the rainfall kinetic energy derived from the raindrop size distribution dsd measurements using eq 2 ranged from 0 28 mj ha to 15 4 mj ha the results presented in fig 4 a indicate that the kinetic energy of raindrops was maintained during the leafless period as they passed through the canopy the difference was 3 while it decreased by an average of 30 during the leafed period similar can also be observed for the rainfall erosivity factor r which largely depends on the duration of the event the size and velocity of the raindrops as well as the phenophase it should be noted that ke and r are closely related i e r ke i30 however r factor is often used by the usle type soil erosion models such as usle rusle or rusle2 as we can see from fig 4b the rainfall erosivity factor r decreased by 21 and 50 on average after the raindrops passed the canopy during the leafless and leafed periods respectively thus we can conclude that the birch canopy during the leafed period reduced the erosivity factor r by 29 compared to the leafless period the ratio between rainfall erosivity factor r above and below the tree canopy ranged from 0 3 to 15 0 both extreme values were determined in the leafed period fig 5 moreover it can be found that the average ratio between r above and below the tree canopy is 63 lower in the leafless period than in the leafed period fig 5 the seasonal variation of the ratio between rainfall erosivity above and below the tree canopy is shown in fig 6 a the ratio was less than 1 i e rainfall interception did not decrease rainfall erosivity for only 4 precipitation events 2 in leafless and 2 in leafed period more specifically these four events can be explained by an increase in rainfall erosivity due to dropping of larger drops or multiple smaller drops from the canopy during and after the event table 2 fig 6 these four events all had more than 12 mm of rainfall which means that the storage canopy capacity was exceeded zabret and šraj 2021a it is clear that the summer months are characterized by larger rainfall erosivity the rainfall events also have a higher average rainfall intensity fig 6b and rainfall interception leads to a more significant decrease in the rainfall erosivity fig 6a fig 7 shows an example of a medium magnitude event with ratio of rainfall erosivity above and below the canopy smaller than 1 that occurred in november 2017 during the leafless period table 2 as we can see the drop size distribution is fairly even throughout the event both above and below the canopy hence also the average drop diameter and average drop velocity are relatively similar above and below the canopy table 2 rainfall erosivity below the canopy i e around 10 was slightly higher than rainfall erosivity above the tree canopy i e around 50 mj mm ha 1 h 1 a similar relationship can be seen for the rainfall kinetic energy table 2 while i30 values are relatively similar below and above the canopy i e around 7 7 mm h on the other hand fig 8 shows an example of a low medium magnitude rainfall event that occurred in september 2017 during the leafed period the number of raindrops detected during this event was obviously much larger above the canopy than below it fig 8 rainfall erosivity above the canopy was about 2 times higher than the rainfall erosivity below the canopy i e 15 mj mm ha 1 h 1 table 2 the kinetic energy above the canopy was also higher than below the canopy although the difference was not very significant table 2 in case of this event also the i30 below the canopy was around 40 lower compared to intensity above the canopy which was equal to around 7 7 mm h table 2 thus the vegetation intercepted a large portion of the raindrops and reduced their kinetic energy and rainfall intensities i e i30 especially compared to the leafless period and the rainfall event that is shown in fig 7 where there was almost no reduction in i30 it should be noted that the mean i30 above and below the canopy is equal to 18 mm h and 12 5 mm h respectively while the maximum values of the i30 for the detected rainfall events are equal to 78 mm h and 105 mm h below and above the canopy respectively hence it can be seen that specific ratios between rainfall intensities kinetic energy and consequently of the erosive power of raindrops depend on characteristics of rainfall event and can vary significantly from one event to another furthermore a detailed analysis of the extreme magnitude rainfall event with a kinetic energy of 15 4 mj ha was also conducted table 2 fig 9 the event was recorded on august 14 2018 when a summer storm occurred the event had the highest kinetic energy among all 58 events considered above and below the tree canopy it lasted for 7 1 h during this time 90 7 mm of rain fell above the birch canopy and 60 7 mm was recorded below it the rainfall intensity was 12 mm h and the throughfall intensity was 8 mm h raindrops above the canopy with an average diameter of 1 1 mm reached an average drop velocity of 4 5 m s while the average diameter of raindrops below the canopy decreased to 0 7 mm and drop velocity to 3 6 m s table 2 the kinetic energy of the event decreased from 15 4 mj ha above the tree canopy to 9 8 mj ha below it which is 36 the rainfall erosivity factor r was 1632 mj mm ha 1 h 1 above the tree canopy and decreased to 769 mj mm ha 1 h 1 below it in this case rainfall interception by the tree canopy reduced the rainfall erosivity factor by 53 moreover it can be seen that during the extreme event which occurred in leafed period the interception by vegetation lead to a lagged dripping from leaves after the peak rainfall intensity above the canopy fig 9 moreover the rainfall erosivity of this event can be regarded as relatively extreme and is within the range of the annual rainfall erosivity at some european locations e g parts of central or eastern europe panagos et al 2015a furthermore for the entire period of measurements used in this study this specific event contributed to around 22 of the total rainfall erosivity which was equal to around 7 200 mj mm ha h the total recorded rainfall erosivity can be regarded as relatively extreme but it should be noted that it includes two summer seasons hence this is in accordance to the results presented by bezak et al 2021 who showed that around 5 10 events are needed to account for 50 of the annual rainfall erosivity at this part of europe bezak et al 2021 also showed that inequality described with gini coefficient in slovenia is among the highest in europe on the other hand fig 7 and fig 8 present two examples of low to medium intensity rainfall events that are associated with much smaller rainfall erosivity values compared to the summer event that is shown in fig 9 these findings are consistent with the results of previous studies for example cao et al 2008 reported that erosivity is reduced mainly by rainfall interception on the other hand some authors goebes 2015 nanko et al 2020 2006 indicated that leaf dripping may also increase rainfall erosivity in some cases li et al 2019 found that kinetic energy below the canopy of pinus massoniana lamb forest is reduced at higher rainfall intensity and the effect is reversed at lower rainfall intensity 3 3 connection of the rainfall interception impact to usle type methodology in the scope of the usle type methodology renard et al 1997 the vegetation effect is considered using the dimensionless crop cover and management factor c thus different values for the crop cover and management factor can be found in the literature for a given land use type bezak et al 2015 esetlili et al 2014 panagos et al 2015b renard et al 1997 for example thapa 2020 used a value of 0 03 for forest and a value of 0 45 for bare land and 0 01 for grassland on the other hand bezak et al 2015 used a value of 0 002 for forest and a value of 0 004 for pastures other studies also report different values for the crop cover and management factor and most studies do not distinguish between forest types e g deciduous and coniferous tree species thus it is clear that such assessments have a high degree of subjectivity while most studies apply a constant value of the crop cover and management factor for soil erosion calculations bezak et al 2015 esetlili et al 2014 thapa 2020 it is clear that the effect of vegetation depends on numerous meteorological factors and vegetation characteristics as shown in this study therefore the use of a constant value of factor c in the context of soil erosion assessments using the usle type methodology may lead to uncertain results it should be noted that the rusle manual provides detailed description of how time varying parameters should be calculated e g half month values renard et al 1997 therefore additional investigations using high frequency measurements below and above different vegetation species should be conducted to evaluate the accuracy of soil erosion calculations using the usle type methodology and to estimate the potential error in cases where a constant value of parameter c is used in the calculations therefore the soil erosion modelling community bezak et al 2021b borrelli et al 2021 should focus on better and more frequent consideration of varying or seasonal dependent dimensionless crop cover and management factor and more precise estimation of rainfall erosivity it should be noted that nearing et al 2017 have pointed out that the empirical equations used by rusle to estimate rainfall erosivity may underestimate erosivity while providing a reasonable estimate of the spatial or temporal differences in erosivity hence the use of the original usle or rusle2 energy equation is suggested nearing et al 2017 moreover it should also be noted that rainfall erosivity is an empirically based index and that actual soil erosion rates depend on numerous factors nearing et al 2017 for example nearing et al 2017 pointed out that kinetic energy of raindrops is not the driving force behind the rill erosion in some cases additionally one should be aware that there are several limitations related to the usle type models as discussed by alewell et al 2019 nevertheless usle type models are the most commonly applied for soil erosion assessment worldwide borrelli et al 2021 4 conclusions this study presents the results of 14 month measurements using optical disdrometers placed below and above the birch tree canopy in an urban park in ljubljana slovenia based on the results presented it can be concluded that i rainfall interception by birch yielded a decrease in the number of raindrops fall velocity and their diameter below the canopy compared to the rainfall in the open the average decrease in these characteristics for the 58 rainfall events was 20 7 and 27 for the number of drops fall velocity and drop diameter respectively ii this also resulted in reduced kinetic energy of rainfall that was not intercepted by the canopy and consequently reduced rainfall erosivity in general moreover the differences between the kinetic energy 3 and 30 in the leafless and leafed periods respectively and rainfall erosivity 21 and 50 for the leafless and leafed periods respectively below and above the tree canopy can be considered significant and are clearly not constant throughout the year but depends on seasonal characteristics meteorological conditions and vegetation properties therefore the decrease in the rainfall erosivity due to rainfall interception can vary significantly from one rainfall event to another moreover it was shown that few events can contribute to the majority of the annual rainfall erosivity this indicates that high inequality exists in the magnitudes of erosive rainfall events iii there was a clear difference in the number of drops fall velocity drop diameter kinetic energy and rainfall erosivity in the leafless and leafed periods for example the average ratio between r above and below the tree canopy is 63 lower in the leafless period than in the leafed period therefore it is clear that vegetation cover such as trees have an important effect on the reduction of the kinetic energy of raindrops hitting the soil and thus on soil erosion rates by reducing rainfall erosivity therefore nature based solutions that involve vegetation such as trees not only have a positive impact on the microclimate flood risk control but also have a significant impact on reducing the kinetic energy of rainfall and thus soil erosion this is especially important as climate change is expected to increase the intensity of the most extreme rainfall events and trees could be used to cope with potential increase in soil erosion rates in the coming decades moreover soil erosion modelling community should more frequently apply time varying crop management factor rather than using constant factor in relation to applying usle type models more detailed investigations regarding the drop size distribution characteristics will be performed in future since the experimental plot in the city of ljubljana was upgraded with measurements of drop size distribution characteristics also below the pine tree canopy authors contributions a zore data validation data analysis results interpretation n bezak formulation of the aims of the study
