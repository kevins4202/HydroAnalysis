2720,climate change is projected to impact on the magnitude spatial location and timing of large precipitation events with evidence for this already present in the historical record however determining the impacts of these precipitation changes on floods is non trivial as floods are a result of many compounding factors for example changes in the timing and spatial distribution of rainfalls influence soil moisture conditions prior to the flood causing precipitation event which in turn change the peak and volume of the resultant flood despite this the impact of climate changed precipitation on runoff and flood volumes has yet to be quantified historically or examined under different scenarios of climate change it has previously been suggested that in australia the impact of increased precipitation on floods have been partially offset by decreases in soil moisture prior to storms here we seek to quantify the change in flood event runoff coefficients resulting from climate change across australia where it is hoped that such information can be used to help inform the projections of floods resulting from climate change induced precipitation changes we use an event runoff coefficient to assess the flood runoff response to precipitation events containing the annual maximum three day rainfall event the assessment was applied to 467 unimpaired catchments in australia ranging across arid temperate and tropical climates catchments in temperate climates largely show decreasing trends in event runoff coefficients while increasing trends were observed in tropical regions statistically significant trend magnitudes of up to 0 13 per decade were found runoff outputs from a semi distributed landscape model were then used to assess projected runoff responses under different scenarios of future climates the outputs of modelled runoff were first validated and shown to adequately capture the observed spatial and temporal trends in flood event runoff coefficients despite underestimating the trend magnitude the projections showed that the median proportion of rainfall converted to runoff from large rainfall events will decrease into the future across over 80 of unimpaired catchments in australia under climate change scenarios of rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 future work will investigate how these reductions in flood volume are best represented by rainfall loss models used widely in operational flood forecasts and design applications keywords flood event runoff coefficient flood climate change extreme precipitation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction global observations have shown that the frequency of heavy precipitation events and the proportion of total rainfall that occurs within heavy precipitation events has increased over most terrestrial areas seneviratne et al 2012 westra et al 2013 sun et al 2021 under increased global mean temperatures resulting from anthropogenic climate change these trends in precipitation are projected to continue grose et al 2020 fowler et al 2021 ipcc 2021 australia specific studies have shown clear increasing trends in the frequency and intensity of 1 2 day precipitation events across most of the continent wasko and nathan 2019 dey et al 2020 although changes in daily precipitation extremes may be within the historical range of natural variability jakob and walland 2016 recent changes in sub daily rainfall have been found however to be outside the range of internal variability guerreiro et al 2018 westra and sisson 2011 and have increased at a higher rate than what is expected in response to thermodynamic controls visser et al 2021 observed and projected increases in the intensity of precipitation have led to speculation that fluvial and pluvial flooding herein referred to by the more general term floods will likewise increase under climate change e g bates et al 2008 westra et al 2014 however gauged records of frequent through to rare floods in predominately unimpaired catchments around the world have largely somewhat paradoxically remained unchanged or even decreased lins and slack 1999 bl√∂schl et al 2015 do et al 2017 wasko et al 2021a the apparent dichotomy between changes in precipitation and flooding is due to the complexity inherent in flood generation flood events depend not only on precipitation but also on catchment specific conditions and processes eagleson 1972 for example climate change impacts on precipitation patterns chang et al 2016 and rates of evaporation stephens et al 2018 grossiord et al 2020 denson et al 2021 in turn affect soil moisture bates et al 2008 feng and zhang 2015 which then impacts on the catchment response to rainfall berthet et al 2009 ivancic and shaw 2015 wasko and sharma 2017 the flood response to a given precipitation event is highly variable both in terms of the flood peak as well as the total flood volume kuczera et al 2006 nathan et al 2016 and a key driver of this variability is the soil moisture prior to the precipitation event merz et al 2006 berghuijs et al 2016 most large sample studies that consider flood event responses to precipitation events have either focused on classifying the event mechanisms e g berghuijs et al 2016 stein et al 2020 or relating runoff responses to catchment or hydroclimatic characteristics e g ball et al 2019a with a small number of studies assessing the temporal variability of flood event responses e g tarasova et al 2018 davenport et al 2020 in contrast assessments of temporal trends in floods and drivers of floods have largely focused on individual variables such as annual maximum time series sun et al 2015 do et al 2017 kemter et al 2020 flow quantiles lins and slack 1999 gudmundsson et al 2019 flow volumes he et al 2022 and indicators of soil moisture woldemeskel and sharma 2016 in australia assessments of temporal trends in drivers and indicators of flood have also typically focussed on solitary variables johnson et al 2016 such as flood peaks ishak et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 rainfall peaks and soil moisture e g wasko and nathan 2019 in addition studies considering the temporal variability of floods in australia generally focus on variability on interannual and multi decadal timescales driven by long memory ocean atmospheric dynamics e g chiew et al 1998 kiem et al 2003 verdon et al 2004 to the best of the authors knowledge assessments investigating temporal trends in flood responses at an event scale with the aim of informing impacts of climate change induced precipitation changes on floods are lacking and will therefore be the focus of this study in the context of climate change changes in antecedent soil moisture conditions have implications for modelling used in engineering design and operational flood forecasts into the future these applications typically use event based rainfall runoff models and parsimonious models of rainfall losses namely the rainfall that is not converted to runoff that accounts for the impact of antecedent conditions o shea et al 2021 runoff models run on a continuous basis provide an avenue for assessing changes in antecedent conditions as the catchment conditions between rainfall events are modelled us army corps of engineers 2000 estimating the antecedent catchment conditions provides the potential to then account for rainfall losses which are critical inputs to event based rainfall runoff models paquet et al 2013 li et al 2014 stephens et al 2018 the ability to inform potential changes in how rainfall losses are modelled in flood event modelling requires an evaluation of volumetric flood measures however changes in the volumetric flood response will not only impact on flooding but also on water supply as floods make up a large proportion of the water in storage sharma et al 2018 as well supporting ecosystem health and biodiversity nature climate change editorial 2018 spatial patterns and temporal trends in the volumetric flood response to precipitation both historically and under climate change are critical to understanding the changing nature of flooding in a future climate but have received little attention to date in this study we use flood event runoff coefficients to characterise the flood response to large annual rainfall events that are likely to generate runoff here we use the term event runoff coefficient as adopted by merz et al 2006 to represent the portion of rainfall that becomes direct runoff during an event although the spatial variability of runoff coefficients and characteristics have been well studied merz et al 2006 sriwongsitanon and taesombat 2011 dhakal et al 2012 tarasova et al 2018 to the authors knowledge the temporal trend in flood event runoff coefficients and their projected changes under climate change has not we begin by presenting spatial patterns and temporal trends in historical runoff coefficients across australia to inform future projections of runoff responses suitable representation of regional climate particularly regional changes in precipitation and evapotranspiration are required in candidate climate and runoff models a validation of runoff simulated in a continuous water balance model is therefore undertaken to determine which flood characteristics are adequately simulated and could be used to examine changes in flood responses under climate change finally projected changes in runoff response across the continent of australia are presented 2 data an overview of the climate and streamflow data used in this study is shown in fig 1 the data sources are further described in this section while the model validation and methods used to calculate event runoff coefficients is described in section 3 2 1 precipitation data daily gridded precipitation data from the australian gridded climate data agcd v1 australian bureau of meteorology 2020 formerly known as the australia water availability project awap dataset jones et al 2009 are used agcd precipitation data are spatially interpolated from rainfall gauges across australia with the number of gauges ranging between 3000 and 8000 over the interpolation period of 1900 to 2021 the data are interpolated to a 0 05 0 05 latitude longitude grid 5 km 5 km and were spatially averaged over each of the 467 catchments containing gauges in the hydrologic reference station network see section 2 2 the r package raster hijmans and van etten 2021 was used to extract and calculate the mean daily precipitation over each catchment area with days defined as the 24 hr period prior to 9 am 2 2 streamflow data daily gauged volumetric streamflow records from the hydrologic reference station hrs network fig 2 are used to provide a gauged record of historical flows the hrs are a network of streamflow gauging stations in australia compiled by the australian bureau of meteorology bom for the purpose of assessing long term climate induced variability and change in streamflow bom 2020 stations in the network are in catchments classified as unimpaired meaning they are largely unaffected by streamflow regulation water extraction and land use change the catchments range in size from 10 km2 to over 200 000 km2 and experience tropical dry and temperate climates peel et al 2007 the hrs have minimum record lengths of 30 years with 5 missing data missing data has been infilled using the gr4j model perrin et al 2003 and infilled flow volumes contribute to 10 of the total volume while flow volumes obtained by extrapolating rating curves contribute to 25 of the total volume bom 2020 the hrs network was updated in august 2020 to include gauges from 467 catchments an expansion from the initial network of 222 sites previously release in 2013 zhang et al 2016 2 3 modelled and projected data 2 3 1 downscaled and bias corrected precipitation data downscaled and bias corrected precipitation data modelled in four general circulation models gcms under three different climate scenarios was used the data is obtained from the bom s national hydrological projections dataset bom 2022 srikanthan et al 2022 wilson et al 2022 the three scenarios were one baseline historical scenario and two climate change scenarios the climate change scenarios explored were representative concentration pathways 4 5 rcp 4 5 and 8 5 rcp 8 5 which correspond to radiative forcing of approximately 4 5 w m2 and 8 5 w m2 in the year 2100 meinshausen et al 2011 van vuuren et al 2011 rcp 4 5 represents an intermediate level of greenhouse gas mitigations while rcp 8 5 represents a scenario of very high emissions a selection of four gcms was made by the bom based on 1 adequate representation of spatial and temporal patterns of climate features that are of importance for the australian climate moise et al 2015 2 representation of the range of uncertainty in future projections and 3 the availability of daily outputs for all variables required for hydrological simulations using the bom s hydrological model awra l see section 2 3 2 these four gcms were access1 0 cnrm cm5 gfdl esm2m and miroc5 a single run from each model was used precipitation outputs from these four gcms were re gridded and bias corrected using three statistical bias correction methods these methods were isimip2b hempel et al 2013 a trend preserving uni variate approach a multivariate recursive nested bias correction method mrnbc mehrotra and sharma 2015 and a quantile matching for extremes method qme dowdy 2019 a fourth downscaling method referred to as ccam isimip2b involved dynamically downscaling the gcm outputs using the regional climate model ccam mcgregor and dix 2001 and bias correcting using the isimip2b method for simplicity we refer to downscaled and bias corrected gcm precipitation as gcm precipitation the four downscaling techniques applied to four gcm outputs resulted in 16 different projections of climate we refer to these downscaled and bias corrected gcm results as a 16 member ensemble noting that this is not a true ensemble as bias correction methods do not result in statistical independence 2 3 2 modelled estimates of historical streamflow awra l as projections of streamflow under climate change rely on climate sensitive models of runoff runoff coefficients calculated using outputs from the australian water resource assessment landscape modelling system awra l were evaluated against runoff coefficients calculated using gauged observations awra l is a semi distributed model representing water stores at the surface shallow and deep soil layers frost et al 2018 it was developed by the bom and the commonwealth scientific and industrial research organisation and is run operationally by the bom as part of the australian water outlook to inform historical assessments seasonal forecasts and long term projections of water availability across australia for the historical simulations awra l was forced with observed climate inputs including maximum and minimum temperature and precipitation from agcd as well as wind speed from interpolated wind speed observations mcvicar et al 2008 and solar exposure interpolated from geostationary satellites grant et al 2008 frost et al 2018 the awra l model is calibrated against gauged streamflow as well as satellite derived observations of evapotranspiration and soil moisture awra l is run at a daily timestep using the same spatial grid as the agcd climate inputs that have a spatial resolution of 0 05 0 05 latitude longitude grid 5 km 5 km awra l simulates the hydrological processes of infiltration evaporation and evapotranspiration overland flow sub surface storage and flow and provides outputs including total discharge to streams which is used in this study the modelling approach of awra l is aimed at providing a consistent approach to modelling water resources at the continental scale the need to model water resources at the continental scale necessarily involved sacrificing accuracy at the catchment scale though the nash sutcliffe efficiency scores for the daily continental simulations are on average only 0 07 less than the results obtained using locally calibrated models frost and wright 2018 awra l has demonstrated capability in reproducing the direction of historical trends in runoff extremes wasko et al 2021b and in reproducing root zone soil moisture observations comparable with remotely sensed data holgate et al 2016 2 3 3 catchment aggregated runoff and climate projections projections of streamflow modelled using awra l were obtained from the bom as part of the national hydrological projections dataset srikanthan et al 2022 wilson et al 2022 the climate inputs to awra l precipitation temperature wind speed and solar exposure were downscaled and bias corrected from gcms under the climate scenarios described in section 2 3 1 downscaled and bias corrected climate variables are referred to as ensemble member climate outputs daily runoff modelled in awra l using the ensemble member climate outputs was obtained for three time periods a 30 year historical baseline spanning from 1976 to 2005 and two 30 year future periods spanning from 2036 to 2065 and 2070 to 2099 which are referred to as 2050 and 2085 projections respectively the projected periods were explored under the two climate change scenarios described in section 2 3 1 for simplicity we refer to the 16 member ensemble of historical runoff simulations using awra l forced with gcm outputs as baseline gcm runoff projected gcm runoff refers to the runoff modelled in awra l using the 16 ensemble member climate outputs for the future period either for rcp 4 5 or rcp 8 5 again note that the use of the term ensemble here does not indicate statistical independence amongst ensemble members given the 16 ensemble members are derived from four gcms runoff modelled in awra l were spatially averaged across each of the 467 catchments containing gauges in the hrs network to provide estimates of streamflow it is reasonable to assume that the unrouted simulated runoff can be aggregated to represent streamflow given our analysis considers volumetric flooding over multiple days where routing effects would be minimal see section 4 2 for evaluation 3 methods 3 1 identification of annual extreme precipitation time series for each catchment a three day annual maximum precipitation time series was calculated using agcd rainfall from 1900 to 2021 and rainfall from downscaled gcms over the 30 year baseline 1976 2005 and two future time periods 2036 2065 and 2070 2099 the aggregation of rainfall over three days was selected as it approximates the duration of mesoscale through to synoptic scale weather systems sturman and tapper 1996 fig 1 3 that are typically associated with generating floods in unimpaired catchments across a range of catchment sizes a three day aggregation also reduces errors in identifying rainfall events that occur across the nominal daily delineation of 9 am local time the three day annual maximum precipitation was identified within each catchment specific water year the water year was defined using gauged data where the start of the water year was the month with the minimum average monthly streamflow akhavan et al 2020 wasko et al 2020 for water years with a starting month of january to june the water year corresponds to the calendar year of the first month for water years with a starting month of july to december the water year corresponds to the calendar year of the last month only data from complete water years were retained three day rolling averages were calculated for each day in the record with the date corresponding to the last date in the window if annual maxima occurred within seven days of each other i e near the end of one water year and the start of the next the lower value was discarded and replaced with the next highest three day average precipitation event to yield a time series of independent three day rainfall annual maxima 3 2 flow response to precipitation to investigate flood runoff responses to large rainfall events a separation of baseflows from the direct runoff response known as a quick flow was performed using a digital filter and applied to both gauged streamflow and modelled runoff we note that digital filters are intended to provide a hydrologically plausible representation of baseflows and direct flows rather than an exact representation of the physical baseflow su et al 2016 as true values of baseflow can only be estimated with detailed field observations nathan and mcmahon 1990 ladson et al 2013 which are relatively sparse we use a recursive digital filter as described in lyne and hollick 1979 q d t Œ± q d t 1 1 Œ± 2 q t q t 1 where qd t is the flow resulting from direct runoff or the filtered quick response at time step t qt is the total streamflow at time t and Œ± is the filter parameter the filter was applied using three passes forward backwards then forwards again using Œ± 0 925 nathan and mcmahon 1990 implemented using the hydroevents r package wasko and guo 2022 an example of the resulting baseflow separation is shown in fig 3 b unless stated otherwise all subsequent references to runoff refer to the direct runoff the technique selected here has been shown to be comparable with traditional graphical techniques nathan and mcmahon 1990 and their approximations sloto and crouse 1996 eckhardt 2008 and are hence suitable for assessing relative differences in the direct runoff responses to large precipitation events across a continental scale 3 3 event identification and calculation of event runoff coefficients the three day annual maximum precipitation time series was used as the basis to identify the occurrence of the annual rainfall runoff events of interest see example in fig 3 a of a daily rainfall time series over a water year the start of the runoff response was identified as the nearest direct flow local minimum occurring either during or before the 3 day annual maximum precipitation local flow minima were identified by calculating the first derivative of direct runoff the start of the event was identified as the first day with precipitation 1 mm occurring immediately prior to the start of the runoff response i e prior to the rising limb of the hydrograph the end of the event was defined as the day when the direct runoff fell below 7 5 of the maximum direct flow within the search window fig 3 b numerous methods exist for delineating rainfall runoff events namely the identification of the peak flows or rainfalls and the start and end of the event mei and anagnostou 2015 tarasova et al 2018 previous studies have defined events in a manner aimed at replicating manual hydrograph inspection methods e g ali et al 2015 tang and carey 2017 and a similar approach is used here we use a uniform search window of relatively long duration 45 days to accommodate the range of runoff response times across the large number of catchments included in this study as the start and end of the event is defined relative to the maximum rainfall and flow a longer search window will not change the identification of events in catchments with faster response times identifying the start of the event namely the start of precipitation that contributes to the floods is relatively straight forward whereas the end point often relies on heuristics and is dependent on the base flow separation method tang and carey 2017 wasko and guo 2022 a range of cut off percentages from 0 to 15 of the peak flow at 2 5 intervals were trialled and a selection of events from a sample of catchments spanning a broad range of catchment sizes climates and locations were visually inspected a cut off of 7 5 was selected to provide a balance between excluding a significant portion of the runoff volume when higher percentages were used in contrast to defining excessively long duration events when smaller percentages were used once the event extents were defined the volume of both the streamflow and precipitation occurring over the event were totalled by taking the sum of daily rainfall and daily direct runoff over the event capell et al 2012 the event runoff coefficient rc was calculated as the total direct discharge volume divided by the total precipitation volume over the duration of the event namely rc start end q d start end p where p is the daily precipitation and both p and qd are measured in mm day the event rc was calculated for the event containing the annual maximum three day precipitation in every water year in every catchment for gauged streamflow data the calculation of the event rc was applied to 22 549 discrete events for streamflow modelled in awra l using historical and projected climate detailed below over a million discrete rainfall runoff events were analysed 3 4 assessing historical flood event rcs historical means and trends in flood event rcs were calculated using gauged streamflow and agcd precipitation green boxes and arrows in fig 1 these statistics were calculated for each of the 467 catchments where concurrent streamflow and precipitation records were available the same statistics were recalculated for a 40 year period 1980 2019 where concurrent streamflow and rainfall records were available across a subset of 357 catchments to provide a consistent period of assessment and comparability across locations trends were calculated using both linear regression and sen s slope sen 1968 bootstrap resampling was used to calculate the p value of the linear regression slope coefficient a two sided p value was calculated for both the linear regression slope coefficient and sen s slope and a significance level of Œ± 0 05 was adopted for rejecting the null hypothesis of zero trend 3 5 validation of model estimated runoff characteristics of event scale runoff modelled in awra l were compared against observed data to determine if the representation of runoff responses was sufficient for inferring changes under climate change historical model estimated rcs were calculated for each catchment using estimates of runoff from the awra l model blue box in fig 1 the efficacy of the awra l model was assessed by comparing the mean historical model estimated rc derived for each catchment with historical observed rcs green box in fig 1 and by comparing temporal trends in rcs trends in model estimated rcs were calculated in the same way as described in section 3 4 3 6 climate change evaluation and impacts on flood event runoff coefficients climate change projections of both annual maximum three day precipitation and flood event rcs were evaluated by comparing baseline values over the period 1976 2005 red box in fig 1 with historical precipitation and historical model estimated rcs blue box in fig 1 over the same period a kolmogorov smirnov test ks test was used to assess the significance of the difference in rc from different baseline climates the null hypothesis rejected at a significance level of Œ± 0 05 was the assumption that the distribution of baseline rcs was no different to the distribution of historical model estimated rcs catchments where ks tests were not rejected in any of the 16 ensemble results were retained the impact of climate change on rcs was evaluated by calculating the change in median rc under climate change the change was calculated as the differences between the 30 year baseline period 1976 2005 to two future 30 year periods of 2036 2065 nominally 2050 and 2070 2099 nominally 2085 red boxes in fig 1 the climate change impact on rcs was calculated for each ensemble member under the two scenarios of rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 4 results 4 1 historical patterns of flood event rcs historical mean flood event rc values vary with climate zone fig 4 in arid inland australia low rc values 0 1 indicate only a small proportion of the annual maximum rainfall appears as runoff conversely higher rc values up to 0 73 are seen in temperate coastal and tropical regions indicating a larger proportion of large rainfall events is converted to runoff these spatial patterns were the same when assessing the subset of 357 catchments with records that spanned a common 40 year period over 1980 2019 see fig a 1 a the trends in flood rcs were calculated to examine the possibility of long term changes in flood responses to large rainfall events these trends are plotted for gauged results in fig 5 a where coloured blue red triangles and circles represent statistically significant increasing decreasing trends at the Œ± 0 05 and Œ± 0 1 level respectively the trends calculated using the sen s slope estimator gave similar results to linear regression see fig a 2 while trends calculated using data between 1980 and 2019 showed similar magnitudes and spatial patterns see fig a 3 a positive trend indicates an average annual increase in the volume of precipitation that appears as streamflow e g for a catchment with an expected flood event rc of 0 3 a 100 mm rainfall event would yield a runoff depth of 30 mm a 0 1 trend per decade would mean that in 10 years the same rainfall event would yield runoff with a depth of 40 mm the magnitude of gauged flood event rc trends ranges from 0 13 to 0 10 per decade box plots using gauged streamflow data are shown in orange in fig 5 c stratified by k√∂ppen climate regions the spatial trends in runoff responses to large rainfalls are comparable to previous assessments of trends in annual high and low streamflow ishak et al 2013 wasko et al 2021b and corroborates with scaling relationships between flood volumes and temperature he et al 2022 trends in rc are largely positive in tropical regions suggesting that relatively wet catchments and humid conditions characteristic of tropical regions allow changes in runoff to reflect the increasing trends in annual maximum precipitation alexander and arblaster 2017 trends in flood event rcs are largely neutral in catchments with dry climates trend detection in these catchments is hindered by the large standard deviation of event rcs relative to the mean resulting in lower signal to noise ratios in contrast catchments in temperate climates largely show decreases in flood event rcs temperate climates typically experience moderate amounts of rainfall and the decreasing runoff response relative to the event containing the three day annual maximum precipitation suggests increasingly dry antecedent conditions prior to these events to assess how these runoff responses to large precipitation events may continue to change into the future it is necessary to consider runoff modelled in response to a future climate that can account for likely changes in the antecedent catchment conditions the historical gauged flood event rcs provide a basis for assessing whether runoff responses modelled in awra l can adequately characterise responses to large rainfall events and whether it has the potential to subsequently provide insights into runoff responses under a changed climate the flood event rc was therefore first recalculated over the same historical temporal period as the available gauged streamflow data using estimates of historical runoff modelled in awra l 4 2 evaluation of model estimated flood event rcs from awra l 4 2 1 mean flood event rcs from historical model estimated runoff the flood event rc calculated using historical runoff estimated in awra l see fig a 1 exhibits a similar spatial pattern to the results obtained using gauged data in addition correlations between the observed and modelled rcs are high see fig a 4 with a median correlation of 0 80 across the 455 catchments where correlations are significant at the Œ± 0 05 level the difference between mean observed and mean model estimated rcs at each catchment range between 0 43 and 0 3 see fig a 5 a overall model estimated flood event rcs are largely overestimated in tropical regions 38 catchments with smaller differences evident in dry 34 catchments and temperate climates 395 catchments see fig a 5 b the absolute differences between historical observed and model estimated flood event rc are small however when considered relative to the mean hrs values the flood event rc is underestimated by over 30 in around a quarter of catchments see fig 6 conversely rcs are overestimated by over 30 in almost a third of the catchments there is some spatial consistency with regional climate in the difference between the observed and model estimated rcs the model estimated rcs are overestimated throughout most of south west western australia northern queensland in the north east of australia and around the central to north eastern region of victoria in the south east conversely model estimated rcs are underestimated in northern western australia the south coast of new south wales and the east and west coasts of tasmania see fig 2 for state locations however perhaps of most importance is that for the majority of australia there is little systematic bias in the results from modelled estimates compared to observations with opposite signs of bias frequently occurring in adjacent catchments the differences in mean flood event rc using observed and modelled streamflow and runoff data indicate that the magnitude of volumetric runoff responses modelled using awra l may not be suitable for interpretation of runoff generation directly however insights into changes in flood runoff responses using runoff estimated by awra l could potentially be inferred and we therefore examine the capability of awra l to simulate trends in flood event rcs 4 2 2 trends in model estimated flood event rcs the direction and spatial pattern of historical trends in flood event rcs are reproduced in the historical model estimated rcs as shown in fig 5 and these results are further compared in fig 7 a the scatter plot in fig 7 b shows the trends across all catchments with coloured points representing significant trends at a level of Œ± 0 05 a linear regression line through these trend values shows that across all catchments the magnitude of the trend is underestimated in the model estimated event rcs the comparisons of flood event rc in historical observed and model estimated data indicate that while the absolute magnitude in flood event rc is not well represented in the modelled results the direction of trend in flood event rc is well represented consequently it is considered that assessments of the direction of change in flood rcs i e increases or decreases under climate change can be informed by runoff modelled in awra l noting that the magnitude of these changes may be underestimated by 60 70 see fig 7 b the 346 catchments where the direction of change in flood event rcs are the same are retained for further analysis 4 3 projections of flood event rcs no statistically significant difference was found between modelled and baseline event rcs in any of the 16 gcms for 153 out of 346 catchments in over 95 of these locations no statistically significant difference is seen between observed and baseline precipitation in at least 12 of the 16 gcms see fig a 6 in the supplementary material for ks test results for both precipitation and event rc in other words for these 153 catchments it is reasonable to assume that the awra l model simulations derived using the gcm baseline inputs are consistent with simulations based on historical data while baseline precipitation simulations are sufficient to adequately inform runoff responses except for the arid central regions of australia these 153 catchments have a similar spatial distribution as the full network of 467 catchments and thus further analysis of projected changes in runoff responses under climate change was only conducted using this subset of 153 catchments there is a clear regional pattern across all ensemble members that project decreases in flood event rcs across the midlatitudes of australia i e south of approximately 30 s for both emission scenarios considered fig 8 in the 30 year period centred around 2050 under rcp 4 5 the median change in flood event rc is negative in 94 catchments over 60 of catchments broad agreement is seen across the ensemble in 25 catchments where 75 or more of the ensemble members agree with the direction of change as found from the majority of ensemble members circles with black borders in fig 8 for the same period under rcp 8 5 68 out of the 70 catchments with broad agreement across ensemble members show a decrease in flood event rc these patterns of decreased flood event rcs are accompanied by decreases in the minimum mean root zone soil moisture occurring either on the first day of the flood event or the previous day fig a 7 an exception to this concurrent decrease in both flood event rcs and soil moisture is seen in north east australia under rcp 4 5 in 2050 here median changes in event rcs are largely positive noting little agreement between ensemble members while most ensemble members project a decrease in soil moisture the decrease in flood event rc is more pronounced further into the future for both scenarios where reductions in flood event rcs are relatively larger the median flood event rc is projected to decrease in over 80 of the catchments in the 30 years centred on 2085 regardless of the scenario in addition over 50 of these locations show agreement amongst ensemble members as seen by points with black borders fig 8 although a scale bar is shown in fig 8 the magnitude of the differences is likely to be larger than what these results indicate given the underestimation of historical trends using awra l these results are summarised in table 1 shifts in flood event rcs are typically more pronounced under the scenario rcp 8 5 compared with rcp 4 5 suggesting that higher emissions will result in larger reductions in runoff for a given amount of rainfall interestingly where historically rcs have been shown to be increasing across north east queensland this trend is reversed post 2050 pointing to a drier climate across large parts of australia under climate change 5 discussion 5 1 framing flood assessments under climate change climate change is expected to impact floods through changes to precipitation resulting from the increased moisture holding capacity of a warmer atmosphere trenberth et al 2003 scheff and frierson 2014 the simplified atmospheric centred perception that increased precipitation will invariably result in larger floods omits the consideration of flood generation processes because floods are the result of a combination of hydrometeorological factors which are subject to aleatory uncertainty eagleson 1972 precipitation depths of a given probability of exceedance rarely result in a flood event of commensurate probability wright et al 2014 ivancic and shaw 2015 berghuijs et al 2016 nathan et al 2016 michele and salvadori 2002 as a result changes to floods resulting from climate change cannot be quantified as a function of projections of precipitation change alone in contrast flood centred approaches have been used to investigate recent changes in flood characteristics by assessing trends in annual maximum floods in australia ishak et al 2013 wasko and nathan 2019 and across the world do et al 2017 wasko et al 2020 such studies provide valuable insights into how flood characteristics are changing in an overall sense however the identification and attribution of the drivers of changing floods can be confounded by mismatches in the temporal occurrence of extreme precipitation and extreme floods frei et al 2015 small et al 2006 in addition an event selection strategy based on streamflow e g selecting annual maximum floods results in a biased sample of events with wetter antecedent conditions leading to spuriously larger flood responses wasko and guo 2022 which is problematic for informing changes in runoff responses to precipitation events instead of approaching the challenge of understanding climate change impacts on floods through either an atmospheric centred or flood centred perspective the approach used here was aimed at achieving a rainfall centred perspective similar to other studies e g wasko and nathan 2019 o shea et al 2021 this term refers to the selection of events based on rainfall magnitudes that could lead to floods depending on the degree of catchment wetness the analysis of the soil moisture conditions independent of floods can be used to inform our understanding of how changes in rainfall may combine with changes in catchment wetness to influence the future distribution of floods villarini and wasko 2021 particularly in regions like australia where the dependance of rainfall on soil moisture are inconsequential koster et al 2004 it is also worth noting that this approach provides information that suits the application of event based procedures used by flood practitioners whereby flood events are simulated from distributions of rainfall depths and losses chow et al 1988 pilgrim and cordery 1993 nathan and weinmann 2019 5 2 flood volumes and trends in event runoff coefficients given its relevance to the design of small to medium flood structures ball et al 2019b the focus of many flood studies has been on peak flows where the estimation of the full hydrograph and catchment response to a precipitation event may be superfluous in this study the focus has been on changes in total flood volume relative to the total precipitation volume within a discrete event namely the flood event runoff coefficient rc flood volumes play an important role in fulfilling water supplies while flood event rcs have been broadly used in engineering design practice to estimate peak flows merz et al 2006 ball et al 2019b as well as a diagnostic tool that has more recently been applied to numerous catchments with diverse physical attributes across large geographical regions e g merz et al 2006 tarasova et al 2018 the focus on flood volumes also enables insights into changing catchment responses and parameterisation of rainfall loss models used in flood forecasting and design flood estimation which includes the estimation of peak flows the results presented here suggest that flows into water supply reservoirs resulting from large precipitation events will decrease and rainfall losses will increase decreasing trends in the flood event runoff coefficient were found in unimpaired catchments across the temperate regions of australia over the historical period as well as into the future under two different global development and associated greenhouse gas emission scenarios these results reinforce the apparent dichotomy observed across most locations in the world where increased extreme precipitation has coincided with a lack of increases in floods sharma et al 2018 highlighted the importance of considering changes in antecedent soil moisture to explain this apparent disconnect and the work of wasko and nathan 2019 identified drier soil moisture levels as the cause of this divergence between precipitation and flood change across most of australia the results found in this study build upon this knowledge and are the first to quantify the impact that decreased soil moisture imparts on the resulting flood runoff using event specific runoff coefficients further work is needed to assess the impact of changes in the temporal prein et al 2017 guerreiro et al 2018 and spatial wasko et al 2016 peleg et al 2018 distributions of storms on flood generation as suggested in sharma et al 2018 quantifying the impacts of climate change on floods in unimpaired catchments will also provide a foundation for other studies exploring the additional impacts of changes in land use and water management in developed catchments 5 3 validation of runoff simulations our assessment of floods used both gauged streamflow data as well as runoff modelled in awra l the use of modelled runoff was necessary to enable examination of future flows under different climate regimes awra l was selected over other catchment scale models more commonly used in australia such as gr4j and sacramento as it explicitly models local vapour fluxes and energy balances using approaches consistent with gcms moreover it has been calibrated using a global parameter set that provides reasonably similar levels of accuracy across the whole of australia modelling these systems at a local scale using continuous simulation allows for a more plausible representation of future catchment scale energy balances that are critical to representing antecedent catchment conditions and subsequent catchment responses to rainfall however these improved representations of catchment conditions are typically made at the expense of more detailed representation of flood generating processes stephens et al 2018 two key validation steps were undertaken in this study to ensure that the representation of flood volumes resulting from large precipitation events could be adequately represented under changed climate conditions the first validation was to ensure that flood event rcs were adequately represented in awra l awra l was found to adequately capture the directions of observed event rc trends despite underestimating the magnitude of the trends it is possible that the use of locally calibrated models in combination with awra l outputs that inform catchment states could provide improved representation of catchment responses over what is presented here but such improvements might be achieved at the cost of reduced ability to capture catchment responses in a consistent manner across the continent an alternative approach would be to reintroduce the trend bias into the runoff modelled in awra l vogel 2017 the second validation step was to assess whether the climate that results in both large precipitation events and modifications to the antecedent catchment conditions prior to the event could be adequately represented in the ensemble of gcm climate outputs the comparison between flood event rcs modelled in awra l driven by observed historical climate and climate modelled in the baseline gcm runs indicated that the climate variables influencing floods were well represented in all downscaled gcms across most of the catchments the demonstration of comparable results between observed and baseline gcm climate provided the confirmation needed to justify using projected climate as inputs to awra l in some catchments historical flood event rcs were not well represented in any of the baseline gcm results the lack of regional cohesion amongst the poorly represented catchments suggests the existence of catchment specific characteristics that are incompatible with either the runoff modelling parameterisation or the climate downscaling approaches both of which are calibrated to target performances at an australia wide scale in these catchments it is possible that a combination of local characteristics such as orographic effects vegetation dynamics subsurface characteristics and hydrological feedbacks diminish the accuracy of how climate and catchment processes are represented by downscaled climate variables and awra l respectively evans and mccabe 2013 frost and wright 2018 additional catchment specific analysis may be needed for these catchments to ensure that climate inputs are appropriately modelled and runoff models are calibrated in a catchment specific manner 5 4 projections of flood event rcs under climate change suitable representation of regional climate particularly regional changes in precipitation and evapotranspiration are required in climate projections to inform projections of flood event rcs the four gcms and four bias corrected downscaling methods used in this study were selected by the bom for the purposes of producing climate projections to inform hydrological impact studies assessments of gcms have noted that past historical performance may be an inadequate indicator of their ability to project future changes reifen and toumi 2009 in addition ensemble sizes in the order of a few hundred are typically required for capturing the range of internal variability without reference to external forcing mechanisms such as increased greenhouse gases daron and stainforth 2013 nevertheless the gcm projections used here provide an avenue of insight into potential flood impacts under climate change that is reasonable considering computational capacities the projected decrease in flood event rc across most of australia except for north west australia by the end of the century for both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios represents a decrease in the proportion of runoff that may be expected from large precipitation events while decreasing rcs may suggest decreased flood risk it is possible for this reduction in runoff coefficient to be offset by projections of increased precipitation intensities associated with rising temperatures alexander and arblaster 2017 visser et al 2021 as a result of increased atmospheric water holding capacities mitchell 1989 while extreme precipitation increases have been observed at a global scale that approximate the clausius clapeyron scaling rate of 7 c 1 westra et al 2013 higher temperatures have also been associated with increases in precipitation intensity above the expected clausius clapeyron rate bao et al 2017 coupled with shorter duration storms visser et al 2021 flashier flood events i e those where the flood response occurs shortly after the onset of rainfall are typically associated with infiltration excess runoff mechanisms or hortonian flow however the relative increase in rcs resulting from infiltration excess runoff mechanisms compared with saturation excess runoff mechanisms is offset by the small spatial extent of the storm relative to the catchment size and the shorter storm duration the floods resulting from flashier storms are therefore characterised by lower rcs merz et al 2006 the projection of lower rcs suggests the possibility of either changes in the spatial and temporal distributions of storm rainfalls and or possible future changes in runoff mechanisms resulting from drier antecedent conditions deb et al 2019 tarasova et al 2018 whether decreases in flood event rcs result from drier antecedent conditions alone or are exacerbated by increased storm intensity remains to be determined examining how changes in rainfall losses are partitioned into initial losses those that occur prior to runoff commencing and continuing losses the ongoing average rate of rainfall loss over the remainder of the rainfall event could provide insights into whether runoff mechanisms are changing under climate change stein et al 2020 we hypothesise that a shift towards flashier floods could be identified through decreased initial losses in line with infiltration excess runoff mechanisms or hortonian flow and increased continuing losses due to the catchment being unsaturated analysing flood responses at a sub daily scale would allow for this inquiry and is the focus of future work rising temperatures are also expected to increase the proportion of precipitation that falls as rain rather than snow trenberth 2011 although much of australia already experiences rain dominated precipitation snowfall is critical to planning and management of significant hydropower infrastructure in tasmania and the snowy mountains regions of australia it can therefore be expected that the results presented here will only become more relevant to these regions as well as snow regions globally as temperatures increase further leading to more frequent rainfall driven flood events barnett et al 2005 chegwidden et al 2020 davenport et al 2020 vormoor et al 2016 6 conclusions an analysis of flood event runoff coefficients was used to examine historical trends in runoff responses to precipitation containing the annual water year maximum three day precipitation across 467 unimpaired catchments in australia and to infer potential changes in the runoff response under climate change using an ensemble of results obtained from a landscape water balance model forced by four general circulation models downscaled and bias corrected using four different methods we were able to examine changes in catchment responses to climate change impacts under two scenarios of rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 over the 21st century outputs from the water balance model forced by both historical and projected climate inputs were validated to ensure that the models were fit for purpose the ensemble was found to be credible in 153 of the 346 catchments retained in the analysis of projected changes from these outputs it was found that there is large agreement across the ensemble that the volume of runoff expected from a given volume of precipitation will decrease under climate change across the southern half of australia a region approximating the mid latitudes this is the case for both rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios considered in both 30 year time periods centred around 2050 and 2085 a decrease is also seen across north east australia for the 2085 period under rcp 4 5 opposing the direction of trends seen historically this study provides insights into the relative changes in runoff responses to precipitation events containing the annual maximum three day precipitation across a continental scale the focus on changes in the relative volumetric flood runoff response to precipitation as opposed to flood peaks affirms that the total volume of precipitation converted to runoff is decreasing across the midlatitudes and has historically been increasing in tropical regions of australia in addition this means that the volumetric rainfall losses and subsequent runoff volumes are changing across australia and are indicative of possible changes in runoff generating mechanisms consequently the representation of rainfall losses used in event based rainfall runoff modelling may need to be revised to consider projected climate change impacts of decreased runoff generation with implications for water supply nguyen et al 2020 future research quantifying rainfall losses will be critical for providing capability in operational flood forecasting and flood design under a changing climate as well as informing catchment water supply credit authorship contribution statement michelle ho

2720,climate change is projected to impact on the magnitude spatial location and timing of large precipitation events with evidence for this already present in the historical record however determining the impacts of these precipitation changes on floods is non trivial as floods are a result of many compounding factors for example changes in the timing and spatial distribution of rainfalls influence soil moisture conditions prior to the flood causing precipitation event which in turn change the peak and volume of the resultant flood despite this the impact of climate changed precipitation on runoff and flood volumes has yet to be quantified historically or examined under different scenarios of climate change it has previously been suggested that in australia the impact of increased precipitation on floods have been partially offset by decreases in soil moisture prior to storms here we seek to quantify the change in flood event runoff coefficients resulting from climate change across australia where it is hoped that such information can be used to help inform the projections of floods resulting from climate change induced precipitation changes we use an event runoff coefficient to assess the flood runoff response to precipitation events containing the annual maximum three day rainfall event the assessment was applied to 467 unimpaired catchments in australia ranging across arid temperate and tropical climates catchments in temperate climates largely show decreasing trends in event runoff coefficients while increasing trends were observed in tropical regions statistically significant trend magnitudes of up to 0 13 per decade were found runoff outputs from a semi distributed landscape model were then used to assess projected runoff responses under different scenarios of future climates the outputs of modelled runoff were first validated and shown to adequately capture the observed spatial and temporal trends in flood event runoff coefficients despite underestimating the trend magnitude the projections showed that the median proportion of rainfall converted to runoff from large rainfall events will decrease into the future across over 80 of unimpaired catchments in australia under climate change scenarios of rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 future work will investigate how these reductions in flood volume are best represented by rainfall loss models used widely in operational flood forecasts and design applications keywords flood event runoff coefficient flood climate change extreme precipitation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction global observations have shown that the frequency of heavy precipitation events and the proportion of total rainfall that occurs within heavy precipitation events has increased over most terrestrial areas seneviratne et al 2012 westra et al 2013 sun et al 2021 under increased global mean temperatures resulting from anthropogenic climate change these trends in precipitation are projected to continue grose et al 2020 fowler et al 2021 ipcc 2021 australia specific studies have shown clear increasing trends in the frequency and intensity of 1 2 day precipitation events across most of the continent wasko and nathan 2019 dey et al 2020 although changes in daily precipitation extremes may be within the historical range of natural variability jakob and walland 2016 recent changes in sub daily rainfall have been found however to be outside the range of internal variability guerreiro et al 2018 westra and sisson 2011 and have increased at a higher rate than what is expected in response to thermodynamic controls visser et al 2021 observed and projected increases in the intensity of precipitation have led to speculation that fluvial and pluvial flooding herein referred to by the more general term floods will likewise increase under climate change e g bates et al 2008 westra et al 2014 however gauged records of frequent through to rare floods in predominately unimpaired catchments around the world have largely somewhat paradoxically remained unchanged or even decreased lins and slack 1999 bl√∂schl et al 2015 do et al 2017 wasko et al 2021a the apparent dichotomy between changes in precipitation and flooding is due to the complexity inherent in flood generation flood events depend not only on precipitation but also on catchment specific conditions and processes eagleson 1972 for example climate change impacts on precipitation patterns chang et al 2016 and rates of evaporation stephens et al 2018 grossiord et al 2020 denson et al 2021 in turn affect soil moisture bates et al 2008 feng and zhang 2015 which then impacts on the catchment response to rainfall berthet et al 2009 ivancic and shaw 2015 wasko and sharma 2017 the flood response to a given precipitation event is highly variable both in terms of the flood peak as well as the total flood volume kuczera et al 2006 nathan et al 2016 and a key driver of this variability is the soil moisture prior to the precipitation event merz et al 2006 berghuijs et al 2016 most large sample studies that consider flood event responses to precipitation events have either focused on classifying the event mechanisms e g berghuijs et al 2016 stein et al 2020 or relating runoff responses to catchment or hydroclimatic characteristics e g ball et al 2019a with a small number of studies assessing the temporal variability of flood event responses e g tarasova et al 2018 davenport et al 2020 in contrast assessments of temporal trends in floods and drivers of floods have largely focused on individual variables such as annual maximum time series sun et al 2015 do et al 2017 kemter et al 2020 flow quantiles lins and slack 1999 gudmundsson et al 2019 flow volumes he et al 2022 and indicators of soil moisture woldemeskel and sharma 2016 in australia assessments of temporal trends in drivers and indicators of flood have also typically focussed on solitary variables johnson et al 2016 such as flood peaks ishak et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 rainfall peaks and soil moisture e g wasko and nathan 2019 in addition studies considering the temporal variability of floods in australia generally focus on variability on interannual and multi decadal timescales driven by long memory ocean atmospheric dynamics e g chiew et al 1998 kiem et al 2003 verdon et al 2004 to the best of the authors knowledge assessments investigating temporal trends in flood responses at an event scale with the aim of informing impacts of climate change induced precipitation changes on floods are lacking and will therefore be the focus of this study in the context of climate change changes in antecedent soil moisture conditions have implications for modelling used in engineering design and operational flood forecasts into the future these applications typically use event based rainfall runoff models and parsimonious models of rainfall losses namely the rainfall that is not converted to runoff that accounts for the impact of antecedent conditions o shea et al 2021 runoff models run on a continuous basis provide an avenue for assessing changes in antecedent conditions as the catchment conditions between rainfall events are modelled us army corps of engineers 2000 estimating the antecedent catchment conditions provides the potential to then account for rainfall losses which are critical inputs to event based rainfall runoff models paquet et al 2013 li et al 2014 stephens et al 2018 the ability to inform potential changes in how rainfall losses are modelled in flood event modelling requires an evaluation of volumetric flood measures however changes in the volumetric flood response will not only impact on flooding but also on water supply as floods make up a large proportion of the water in storage sharma et al 2018 as well supporting ecosystem health and biodiversity nature climate change editorial 2018 spatial patterns and temporal trends in the volumetric flood response to precipitation both historically and under climate change are critical to understanding the changing nature of flooding in a future climate but have received little attention to date in this study we use flood event runoff coefficients to characterise the flood response to large annual rainfall events that are likely to generate runoff here we use the term event runoff coefficient as adopted by merz et al 2006 to represent the portion of rainfall that becomes direct runoff during an event although the spatial variability of runoff coefficients and characteristics have been well studied merz et al 2006 sriwongsitanon and taesombat 2011 dhakal et al 2012 tarasova et al 2018 to the authors knowledge the temporal trend in flood event runoff coefficients and their projected changes under climate change has not we begin by presenting spatial patterns and temporal trends in historical runoff coefficients across australia to inform future projections of runoff responses suitable representation of regional climate particularly regional changes in precipitation and evapotranspiration are required in candidate climate and runoff models a validation of runoff simulated in a continuous water balance model is therefore undertaken to determine which flood characteristics are adequately simulated and could be used to examine changes in flood responses under climate change finally projected changes in runoff response across the continent of australia are presented 2 data an overview of the climate and streamflow data used in this study is shown in fig 1 the data sources are further described in this section while the model validation and methods used to calculate event runoff coefficients is described in section 3 2 1 precipitation data daily gridded precipitation data from the australian gridded climate data agcd v1 australian bureau of meteorology 2020 formerly known as the australia water availability project awap dataset jones et al 2009 are used agcd precipitation data are spatially interpolated from rainfall gauges across australia with the number of gauges ranging between 3000 and 8000 over the interpolation period of 1900 to 2021 the data are interpolated to a 0 05 0 05 latitude longitude grid 5 km 5 km and were spatially averaged over each of the 467 catchments containing gauges in the hydrologic reference station network see section 2 2 the r package raster hijmans and van etten 2021 was used to extract and calculate the mean daily precipitation over each catchment area with days defined as the 24 hr period prior to 9 am 2 2 streamflow data daily gauged volumetric streamflow records from the hydrologic reference station hrs network fig 2 are used to provide a gauged record of historical flows the hrs are a network of streamflow gauging stations in australia compiled by the australian bureau of meteorology bom for the purpose of assessing long term climate induced variability and change in streamflow bom 2020 stations in the network are in catchments classified as unimpaired meaning they are largely unaffected by streamflow regulation water extraction and land use change the catchments range in size from 10 km2 to over 200 000 km2 and experience tropical dry and temperate climates peel et al 2007 the hrs have minimum record lengths of 30 years with 5 missing data missing data has been infilled using the gr4j model perrin et al 2003 and infilled flow volumes contribute to 10 of the total volume while flow volumes obtained by extrapolating rating curves contribute to 25 of the total volume bom 2020 the hrs network was updated in august 2020 to include gauges from 467 catchments an expansion from the initial network of 222 sites previously release in 2013 zhang et al 2016 2 3 modelled and projected data 2 3 1 downscaled and bias corrected precipitation data downscaled and bias corrected precipitation data modelled in four general circulation models gcms under three different climate scenarios was used the data is obtained from the bom s national hydrological projections dataset bom 2022 srikanthan et al 2022 wilson et al 2022 the three scenarios were one baseline historical scenario and two climate change scenarios the climate change scenarios explored were representative concentration pathways 4 5 rcp 4 5 and 8 5 rcp 8 5 which correspond to radiative forcing of approximately 4 5 w m2 and 8 5 w m2 in the year 2100 meinshausen et al 2011 van vuuren et al 2011 rcp 4 5 represents an intermediate level of greenhouse gas mitigations while rcp 8 5 represents a scenario of very high emissions a selection of four gcms was made by the bom based on 1 adequate representation of spatial and temporal patterns of climate features that are of importance for the australian climate moise et al 2015 2 representation of the range of uncertainty in future projections and 3 the availability of daily outputs for all variables required for hydrological simulations using the bom s hydrological model awra l see section 2 3 2 these four gcms were access1 0 cnrm cm5 gfdl esm2m and miroc5 a single run from each model was used precipitation outputs from these four gcms were re gridded and bias corrected using three statistical bias correction methods these methods were isimip2b hempel et al 2013 a trend preserving uni variate approach a multivariate recursive nested bias correction method mrnbc mehrotra and sharma 2015 and a quantile matching for extremes method qme dowdy 2019 a fourth downscaling method referred to as ccam isimip2b involved dynamically downscaling the gcm outputs using the regional climate model ccam mcgregor and dix 2001 and bias correcting using the isimip2b method for simplicity we refer to downscaled and bias corrected gcm precipitation as gcm precipitation the four downscaling techniques applied to four gcm outputs resulted in 16 different projections of climate we refer to these downscaled and bias corrected gcm results as a 16 member ensemble noting that this is not a true ensemble as bias correction methods do not result in statistical independence 2 3 2 modelled estimates of historical streamflow awra l as projections of streamflow under climate change rely on climate sensitive models of runoff runoff coefficients calculated using outputs from the australian water resource assessment landscape modelling system awra l were evaluated against runoff coefficients calculated using gauged observations awra l is a semi distributed model representing water stores at the surface shallow and deep soil layers frost et al 2018 it was developed by the bom and the commonwealth scientific and industrial research organisation and is run operationally by the bom as part of the australian water outlook to inform historical assessments seasonal forecasts and long term projections of water availability across australia for the historical simulations awra l was forced with observed climate inputs including maximum and minimum temperature and precipitation from agcd as well as wind speed from interpolated wind speed observations mcvicar et al 2008 and solar exposure interpolated from geostationary satellites grant et al 2008 frost et al 2018 the awra l model is calibrated against gauged streamflow as well as satellite derived observations of evapotranspiration and soil moisture awra l is run at a daily timestep using the same spatial grid as the agcd climate inputs that have a spatial resolution of 0 05 0 05 latitude longitude grid 5 km 5 km awra l simulates the hydrological processes of infiltration evaporation and evapotranspiration overland flow sub surface storage and flow and provides outputs including total discharge to streams which is used in this study the modelling approach of awra l is aimed at providing a consistent approach to modelling water resources at the continental scale the need to model water resources at the continental scale necessarily involved sacrificing accuracy at the catchment scale though the nash sutcliffe efficiency scores for the daily continental simulations are on average only 0 07 less than the results obtained using locally calibrated models frost and wright 2018 awra l has demonstrated capability in reproducing the direction of historical trends in runoff extremes wasko et al 2021b and in reproducing root zone soil moisture observations comparable with remotely sensed data holgate et al 2016 2 3 3 catchment aggregated runoff and climate projections projections of streamflow modelled using awra l were obtained from the bom as part of the national hydrological projections dataset srikanthan et al 2022 wilson et al 2022 the climate inputs to awra l precipitation temperature wind speed and solar exposure were downscaled and bias corrected from gcms under the climate scenarios described in section 2 3 1 downscaled and bias corrected climate variables are referred to as ensemble member climate outputs daily runoff modelled in awra l using the ensemble member climate outputs was obtained for three time periods a 30 year historical baseline spanning from 1976 to 2005 and two 30 year future periods spanning from 2036 to 2065 and 2070 to 2099 which are referred to as 2050 and 2085 projections respectively the projected periods were explored under the two climate change scenarios described in section 2 3 1 for simplicity we refer to the 16 member ensemble of historical runoff simulations using awra l forced with gcm outputs as baseline gcm runoff projected gcm runoff refers to the runoff modelled in awra l using the 16 ensemble member climate outputs for the future period either for rcp 4 5 or rcp 8 5 again note that the use of the term ensemble here does not indicate statistical independence amongst ensemble members given the 16 ensemble members are derived from four gcms runoff modelled in awra l were spatially averaged across each of the 467 catchments containing gauges in the hrs network to provide estimates of streamflow it is reasonable to assume that the unrouted simulated runoff can be aggregated to represent streamflow given our analysis considers volumetric flooding over multiple days where routing effects would be minimal see section 4 2 for evaluation 3 methods 3 1 identification of annual extreme precipitation time series for each catchment a three day annual maximum precipitation time series was calculated using agcd rainfall from 1900 to 2021 and rainfall from downscaled gcms over the 30 year baseline 1976 2005 and two future time periods 2036 2065 and 2070 2099 the aggregation of rainfall over three days was selected as it approximates the duration of mesoscale through to synoptic scale weather systems sturman and tapper 1996 fig 1 3 that are typically associated with generating floods in unimpaired catchments across a range of catchment sizes a three day aggregation also reduces errors in identifying rainfall events that occur across the nominal daily delineation of 9 am local time the three day annual maximum precipitation was identified within each catchment specific water year the water year was defined using gauged data where the start of the water year was the month with the minimum average monthly streamflow akhavan et al 2020 wasko et al 2020 for water years with a starting month of january to june the water year corresponds to the calendar year of the first month for water years with a starting month of july to december the water year corresponds to the calendar year of the last month only data from complete water years were retained three day rolling averages were calculated for each day in the record with the date corresponding to the last date in the window if annual maxima occurred within seven days of each other i e near the end of one water year and the start of the next the lower value was discarded and replaced with the next highest three day average precipitation event to yield a time series of independent three day rainfall annual maxima 3 2 flow response to precipitation to investigate flood runoff responses to large rainfall events a separation of baseflows from the direct runoff response known as a quick flow was performed using a digital filter and applied to both gauged streamflow and modelled runoff we note that digital filters are intended to provide a hydrologically plausible representation of baseflows and direct flows rather than an exact representation of the physical baseflow su et al 2016 as true values of baseflow can only be estimated with detailed field observations nathan and mcmahon 1990 ladson et al 2013 which are relatively sparse we use a recursive digital filter as described in lyne and hollick 1979 q d t Œ± q d t 1 1 Œ± 2 q t q t 1 where qd t is the flow resulting from direct runoff or the filtered quick response at time step t qt is the total streamflow at time t and Œ± is the filter parameter the filter was applied using three passes forward backwards then forwards again using Œ± 0 925 nathan and mcmahon 1990 implemented using the hydroevents r package wasko and guo 2022 an example of the resulting baseflow separation is shown in fig 3 b unless stated otherwise all subsequent references to runoff refer to the direct runoff the technique selected here has been shown to be comparable with traditional graphical techniques nathan and mcmahon 1990 and their approximations sloto and crouse 1996 eckhardt 2008 and are hence suitable for assessing relative differences in the direct runoff responses to large precipitation events across a continental scale 3 3 event identification and calculation of event runoff coefficients the three day annual maximum precipitation time series was used as the basis to identify the occurrence of the annual rainfall runoff events of interest see example in fig 3 a of a daily rainfall time series over a water year the start of the runoff response was identified as the nearest direct flow local minimum occurring either during or before the 3 day annual maximum precipitation local flow minima were identified by calculating the first derivative of direct runoff the start of the event was identified as the first day with precipitation 1 mm occurring immediately prior to the start of the runoff response i e prior to the rising limb of the hydrograph the end of the event was defined as the day when the direct runoff fell below 7 5 of the maximum direct flow within the search window fig 3 b numerous methods exist for delineating rainfall runoff events namely the identification of the peak flows or rainfalls and the start and end of the event mei and anagnostou 2015 tarasova et al 2018 previous studies have defined events in a manner aimed at replicating manual hydrograph inspection methods e g ali et al 2015 tang and carey 2017 and a similar approach is used here we use a uniform search window of relatively long duration 45 days to accommodate the range of runoff response times across the large number of catchments included in this study as the start and end of the event is defined relative to the maximum rainfall and flow a longer search window will not change the identification of events in catchments with faster response times identifying the start of the event namely the start of precipitation that contributes to the floods is relatively straight forward whereas the end point often relies on heuristics and is dependent on the base flow separation method tang and carey 2017 wasko and guo 2022 a range of cut off percentages from 0 to 15 of the peak flow at 2 5 intervals were trialled and a selection of events from a sample of catchments spanning a broad range of catchment sizes climates and locations were visually inspected a cut off of 7 5 was selected to provide a balance between excluding a significant portion of the runoff volume when higher percentages were used in contrast to defining excessively long duration events when smaller percentages were used once the event extents were defined the volume of both the streamflow and precipitation occurring over the event were totalled by taking the sum of daily rainfall and daily direct runoff over the event capell et al 2012 the event runoff coefficient rc was calculated as the total direct discharge volume divided by the total precipitation volume over the duration of the event namely rc start end q d start end p where p is the daily precipitation and both p and qd are measured in mm day the event rc was calculated for the event containing the annual maximum three day precipitation in every water year in every catchment for gauged streamflow data the calculation of the event rc was applied to 22 549 discrete events for streamflow modelled in awra l using historical and projected climate detailed below over a million discrete rainfall runoff events were analysed 3 4 assessing historical flood event rcs historical means and trends in flood event rcs were calculated using gauged streamflow and agcd precipitation green boxes and arrows in fig 1 these statistics were calculated for each of the 467 catchments where concurrent streamflow and precipitation records were available the same statistics were recalculated for a 40 year period 1980 2019 where concurrent streamflow and rainfall records were available across a subset of 357 catchments to provide a consistent period of assessment and comparability across locations trends were calculated using both linear regression and sen s slope sen 1968 bootstrap resampling was used to calculate the p value of the linear regression slope coefficient a two sided p value was calculated for both the linear regression slope coefficient and sen s slope and a significance level of Œ± 0 05 was adopted for rejecting the null hypothesis of zero trend 3 5 validation of model estimated runoff characteristics of event scale runoff modelled in awra l were compared against observed data to determine if the representation of runoff responses was sufficient for inferring changes under climate change historical model estimated rcs were calculated for each catchment using estimates of runoff from the awra l model blue box in fig 1 the efficacy of the awra l model was assessed by comparing the mean historical model estimated rc derived for each catchment with historical observed rcs green box in fig 1 and by comparing temporal trends in rcs trends in model estimated rcs were calculated in the same way as described in section 3 4 3 6 climate change evaluation and impacts on flood event runoff coefficients climate change projections of both annual maximum three day precipitation and flood event rcs were evaluated by comparing baseline values over the period 1976 2005 red box in fig 1 with historical precipitation and historical model estimated rcs blue box in fig 1 over the same period a kolmogorov smirnov test ks test was used to assess the significance of the difference in rc from different baseline climates the null hypothesis rejected at a significance level of Œ± 0 05 was the assumption that the distribution of baseline rcs was no different to the distribution of historical model estimated rcs catchments where ks tests were not rejected in any of the 16 ensemble results were retained the impact of climate change on rcs was evaluated by calculating the change in median rc under climate change the change was calculated as the differences between the 30 year baseline period 1976 2005 to two future 30 year periods of 2036 2065 nominally 2050 and 2070 2099 nominally 2085 red boxes in fig 1 the climate change impact on rcs was calculated for each ensemble member under the two scenarios of rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 4 results 4 1 historical patterns of flood event rcs historical mean flood event rc values vary with climate zone fig 4 in arid inland australia low rc values 0 1 indicate only a small proportion of the annual maximum rainfall appears as runoff conversely higher rc values up to 0 73 are seen in temperate coastal and tropical regions indicating a larger proportion of large rainfall events is converted to runoff these spatial patterns were the same when assessing the subset of 357 catchments with records that spanned a common 40 year period over 1980 2019 see fig a 1 a the trends in flood rcs were calculated to examine the possibility of long term changes in flood responses to large rainfall events these trends are plotted for gauged results in fig 5 a where coloured blue red triangles and circles represent statistically significant increasing decreasing trends at the Œ± 0 05 and Œ± 0 1 level respectively the trends calculated using the sen s slope estimator gave similar results to linear regression see fig a 2 while trends calculated using data between 1980 and 2019 showed similar magnitudes and spatial patterns see fig a 3 a positive trend indicates an average annual increase in the volume of precipitation that appears as streamflow e g for a catchment with an expected flood event rc of 0 3 a 100 mm rainfall event would yield a runoff depth of 30 mm a 0 1 trend per decade would mean that in 10 years the same rainfall event would yield runoff with a depth of 40 mm the magnitude of gauged flood event rc trends ranges from 0 13 to 0 10 per decade box plots using gauged streamflow data are shown in orange in fig 5 c stratified by k√∂ppen climate regions the spatial trends in runoff responses to large rainfalls are comparable to previous assessments of trends in annual high and low streamflow ishak et al 2013 wasko et al 2021b and corroborates with scaling relationships between flood volumes and temperature he et al 2022 trends in rc are largely positive in tropical regions suggesting that relatively wet catchments and humid conditions characteristic of tropical regions allow changes in runoff to reflect the increasing trends in annual maximum precipitation alexander and arblaster 2017 trends in flood event rcs are largely neutral in catchments with dry climates trend detection in these catchments is hindered by the large standard deviation of event rcs relative to the mean resulting in lower signal to noise ratios in contrast catchments in temperate climates largely show decreases in flood event rcs temperate climates typically experience moderate amounts of rainfall and the decreasing runoff response relative to the event containing the three day annual maximum precipitation suggests increasingly dry antecedent conditions prior to these events to assess how these runoff responses to large precipitation events may continue to change into the future it is necessary to consider runoff modelled in response to a future climate that can account for likely changes in the antecedent catchment conditions the historical gauged flood event rcs provide a basis for assessing whether runoff responses modelled in awra l can adequately characterise responses to large rainfall events and whether it has the potential to subsequently provide insights into runoff responses under a changed climate the flood event rc was therefore first recalculated over the same historical temporal period as the available gauged streamflow data using estimates of historical runoff modelled in awra l 4 2 evaluation of model estimated flood event rcs from awra l 4 2 1 mean flood event rcs from historical model estimated runoff the flood event rc calculated using historical runoff estimated in awra l see fig a 1 exhibits a similar spatial pattern to the results obtained using gauged data in addition correlations between the observed and modelled rcs are high see fig a 4 with a median correlation of 0 80 across the 455 catchments where correlations are significant at the Œ± 0 05 level the difference between mean observed and mean model estimated rcs at each catchment range between 0 43 and 0 3 see fig a 5 a overall model estimated flood event rcs are largely overestimated in tropical regions 38 catchments with smaller differences evident in dry 34 catchments and temperate climates 395 catchments see fig a 5 b the absolute differences between historical observed and model estimated flood event rc are small however when considered relative to the mean hrs values the flood event rc is underestimated by over 30 in around a quarter of catchments see fig 6 conversely rcs are overestimated by over 30 in almost a third of the catchments there is some spatial consistency with regional climate in the difference between the observed and model estimated rcs the model estimated rcs are overestimated throughout most of south west western australia northern queensland in the north east of australia and around the central to north eastern region of victoria in the south east conversely model estimated rcs are underestimated in northern western australia the south coast of new south wales and the east and west coasts of tasmania see fig 2 for state locations however perhaps of most importance is that for the majority of australia there is little systematic bias in the results from modelled estimates compared to observations with opposite signs of bias frequently occurring in adjacent catchments the differences in mean flood event rc using observed and modelled streamflow and runoff data indicate that the magnitude of volumetric runoff responses modelled using awra l may not be suitable for interpretation of runoff generation directly however insights into changes in flood runoff responses using runoff estimated by awra l could potentially be inferred and we therefore examine the capability of awra l to simulate trends in flood event rcs 4 2 2 trends in model estimated flood event rcs the direction and spatial pattern of historical trends in flood event rcs are reproduced in the historical model estimated rcs as shown in fig 5 and these results are further compared in fig 7 a the scatter plot in fig 7 b shows the trends across all catchments with coloured points representing significant trends at a level of Œ± 0 05 a linear regression line through these trend values shows that across all catchments the magnitude of the trend is underestimated in the model estimated event rcs the comparisons of flood event rc in historical observed and model estimated data indicate that while the absolute magnitude in flood event rc is not well represented in the modelled results the direction of trend in flood event rc is well represented consequently it is considered that assessments of the direction of change in flood rcs i e increases or decreases under climate change can be informed by runoff modelled in awra l noting that the magnitude of these changes may be underestimated by 60 70 see fig 7 b the 346 catchments where the direction of change in flood event rcs are the same are retained for further analysis 4 3 projections of flood event rcs no statistically significant difference was found between modelled and baseline event rcs in any of the 16 gcms for 153 out of 346 catchments in over 95 of these locations no statistically significant difference is seen between observed and baseline precipitation in at least 12 of the 16 gcms see fig a 6 in the supplementary material for ks test results for both precipitation and event rc in other words for these 153 catchments it is reasonable to assume that the awra l model simulations derived using the gcm baseline inputs are consistent with simulations based on historical data while baseline precipitation simulations are sufficient to adequately inform runoff responses except for the arid central regions of australia these 153 catchments have a similar spatial distribution as the full network of 467 catchments and thus further analysis of projected changes in runoff responses under climate change was only conducted using this subset of 153 catchments there is a clear regional pattern across all ensemble members that project decreases in flood event rcs across the midlatitudes of australia i e south of approximately 30 s for both emission scenarios considered fig 8 in the 30 year period centred around 2050 under rcp 4 5 the median change in flood event rc is negative in 94 catchments over 60 of catchments broad agreement is seen across the ensemble in 25 catchments where 75 or more of the ensemble members agree with the direction of change as found from the majority of ensemble members circles with black borders in fig 8 for the same period under rcp 8 5 68 out of the 70 catchments with broad agreement across ensemble members show a decrease in flood event rc these patterns of decreased flood event rcs are accompanied by decreases in the minimum mean root zone soil moisture occurring either on the first day of the flood event or the previous day fig a 7 an exception to this concurrent decrease in both flood event rcs and soil moisture is seen in north east australia under rcp 4 5 in 2050 here median changes in event rcs are largely positive noting little agreement between ensemble members while most ensemble members project a decrease in soil moisture the decrease in flood event rc is more pronounced further into the future for both scenarios where reductions in flood event rcs are relatively larger the median flood event rc is projected to decrease in over 80 of the catchments in the 30 years centred on 2085 regardless of the scenario in addition over 50 of these locations show agreement amongst ensemble members as seen by points with black borders fig 8 although a scale bar is shown in fig 8 the magnitude of the differences is likely to be larger than what these results indicate given the underestimation of historical trends using awra l these results are summarised in table 1 shifts in flood event rcs are typically more pronounced under the scenario rcp 8 5 compared with rcp 4 5 suggesting that higher emissions will result in larger reductions in runoff for a given amount of rainfall interestingly where historically rcs have been shown to be increasing across north east queensland this trend is reversed post 2050 pointing to a drier climate across large parts of australia under climate change 5 discussion 5 1 framing flood assessments under climate change climate change is expected to impact floods through changes to precipitation resulting from the increased moisture holding capacity of a warmer atmosphere trenberth et al 2003 scheff and frierson 2014 the simplified atmospheric centred perception that increased precipitation will invariably result in larger floods omits the consideration of flood generation processes because floods are the result of a combination of hydrometeorological factors which are subject to aleatory uncertainty eagleson 1972 precipitation depths of a given probability of exceedance rarely result in a flood event of commensurate probability wright et al 2014 ivancic and shaw 2015 berghuijs et al 2016 nathan et al 2016 michele and salvadori 2002 as a result changes to floods resulting from climate change cannot be quantified as a function of projections of precipitation change alone in contrast flood centred approaches have been used to investigate recent changes in flood characteristics by assessing trends in annual maximum floods in australia ishak et al 2013 wasko and nathan 2019 and across the world do et al 2017 wasko et al 2020 such studies provide valuable insights into how flood characteristics are changing in an overall sense however the identification and attribution of the drivers of changing floods can be confounded by mismatches in the temporal occurrence of extreme precipitation and extreme floods frei et al 2015 small et al 2006 in addition an event selection strategy based on streamflow e g selecting annual maximum floods results in a biased sample of events with wetter antecedent conditions leading to spuriously larger flood responses wasko and guo 2022 which is problematic for informing changes in runoff responses to precipitation events instead of approaching the challenge of understanding climate change impacts on floods through either an atmospheric centred or flood centred perspective the approach used here was aimed at achieving a rainfall centred perspective similar to other studies e g wasko and nathan 2019 o shea et al 2021 this term refers to the selection of events based on rainfall magnitudes that could lead to floods depending on the degree of catchment wetness the analysis of the soil moisture conditions independent of floods can be used to inform our understanding of how changes in rainfall may combine with changes in catchment wetness to influence the future distribution of floods villarini and wasko 2021 particularly in regions like australia where the dependance of rainfall on soil moisture are inconsequential koster et al 2004 it is also worth noting that this approach provides information that suits the application of event based procedures used by flood practitioners whereby flood events are simulated from distributions of rainfall depths and losses chow et al 1988 pilgrim and cordery 1993 nathan and weinmann 2019 5 2 flood volumes and trends in event runoff coefficients given its relevance to the design of small to medium flood structures ball et al 2019b the focus of many flood studies has been on peak flows where the estimation of the full hydrograph and catchment response to a precipitation event may be superfluous in this study the focus has been on changes in total flood volume relative to the total precipitation volume within a discrete event namely the flood event runoff coefficient rc flood volumes play an important role in fulfilling water supplies while flood event rcs have been broadly used in engineering design practice to estimate peak flows merz et al 2006 ball et al 2019b as well as a diagnostic tool that has more recently been applied to numerous catchments with diverse physical attributes across large geographical regions e g merz et al 2006 tarasova et al 2018 the focus on flood volumes also enables insights into changing catchment responses and parameterisation of rainfall loss models used in flood forecasting and design flood estimation which includes the estimation of peak flows the results presented here suggest that flows into water supply reservoirs resulting from large precipitation events will decrease and rainfall losses will increase decreasing trends in the flood event runoff coefficient were found in unimpaired catchments across the temperate regions of australia over the historical period as well as into the future under two different global development and associated greenhouse gas emission scenarios these results reinforce the apparent dichotomy observed across most locations in the world where increased extreme precipitation has coincided with a lack of increases in floods sharma et al 2018 highlighted the importance of considering changes in antecedent soil moisture to explain this apparent disconnect and the work of wasko and nathan 2019 identified drier soil moisture levels as the cause of this divergence between precipitation and flood change across most of australia the results found in this study build upon this knowledge and are the first to quantify the impact that decreased soil moisture imparts on the resulting flood runoff using event specific runoff coefficients further work is needed to assess the impact of changes in the temporal prein et al 2017 guerreiro et al 2018 and spatial wasko et al 2016 peleg et al 2018 distributions of storms on flood generation as suggested in sharma et al 2018 quantifying the impacts of climate change on floods in unimpaired catchments will also provide a foundation for other studies exploring the additional impacts of changes in land use and water management in developed catchments 5 3 validation of runoff simulations our assessment of floods used both gauged streamflow data as well as runoff modelled in awra l the use of modelled runoff was necessary to enable examination of future flows under different climate regimes awra l was selected over other catchment scale models more commonly used in australia such as gr4j and sacramento as it explicitly models local vapour fluxes and energy balances using approaches consistent with gcms moreover it has been calibrated using a global parameter set that provides reasonably similar levels of accuracy across the whole of australia modelling these systems at a local scale using continuous simulation allows for a more plausible representation of future catchment scale energy balances that are critical to representing antecedent catchment conditions and subsequent catchment responses to rainfall however these improved representations of catchment conditions are typically made at the expense of more detailed representation of flood generating processes stephens et al 2018 two key validation steps were undertaken in this study to ensure that the representation of flood volumes resulting from large precipitation events could be adequately represented under changed climate conditions the first validation was to ensure that flood event rcs were adequately represented in awra l awra l was found to adequately capture the directions of observed event rc trends despite underestimating the magnitude of the trends it is possible that the use of locally calibrated models in combination with awra l outputs that inform catchment states could provide improved representation of catchment responses over what is presented here but such improvements might be achieved at the cost of reduced ability to capture catchment responses in a consistent manner across the continent an alternative approach would be to reintroduce the trend bias into the runoff modelled in awra l vogel 2017 the second validation step was to assess whether the climate that results in both large precipitation events and modifications to the antecedent catchment conditions prior to the event could be adequately represented in the ensemble of gcm climate outputs the comparison between flood event rcs modelled in awra l driven by observed historical climate and climate modelled in the baseline gcm runs indicated that the climate variables influencing floods were well represented in all downscaled gcms across most of the catchments the demonstration of comparable results between observed and baseline gcm climate provided the confirmation needed to justify using projected climate as inputs to awra l in some catchments historical flood event rcs were not well represented in any of the baseline gcm results the lack of regional cohesion amongst the poorly represented catchments suggests the existence of catchment specific characteristics that are incompatible with either the runoff modelling parameterisation or the climate downscaling approaches both of which are calibrated to target performances at an australia wide scale in these catchments it is possible that a combination of local characteristics such as orographic effects vegetation dynamics subsurface characteristics and hydrological feedbacks diminish the accuracy of how climate and catchment processes are represented by downscaled climate variables and awra l respectively evans and mccabe 2013 frost and wright 2018 additional catchment specific analysis may be needed for these catchments to ensure that climate inputs are appropriately modelled and runoff models are calibrated in a catchment specific manner 5 4 projections of flood event rcs under climate change suitable representation of regional climate particularly regional changes in precipitation and evapotranspiration are required in climate projections to inform projections of flood event rcs the four gcms and four bias corrected downscaling methods used in this study were selected by the bom for the purposes of producing climate projections to inform hydrological impact studies assessments of gcms have noted that past historical performance may be an inadequate indicator of their ability to project future changes reifen and toumi 2009 in addition ensemble sizes in the order of a few hundred are typically required for capturing the range of internal variability without reference to external forcing mechanisms such as increased greenhouse gases daron and stainforth 2013 nevertheless the gcm projections used here provide an avenue of insight into potential flood impacts under climate change that is reasonable considering computational capacities the projected decrease in flood event rc across most of australia except for north west australia by the end of the century for both rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios represents a decrease in the proportion of runoff that may be expected from large precipitation events while decreasing rcs may suggest decreased flood risk it is possible for this reduction in runoff coefficient to be offset by projections of increased precipitation intensities associated with rising temperatures alexander and arblaster 2017 visser et al 2021 as a result of increased atmospheric water holding capacities mitchell 1989 while extreme precipitation increases have been observed at a global scale that approximate the clausius clapeyron scaling rate of 7 c 1 westra et al 2013 higher temperatures have also been associated with increases in precipitation intensity above the expected clausius clapeyron rate bao et al 2017 coupled with shorter duration storms visser et al 2021 flashier flood events i e those where the flood response occurs shortly after the onset of rainfall are typically associated with infiltration excess runoff mechanisms or hortonian flow however the relative increase in rcs resulting from infiltration excess runoff mechanisms compared with saturation excess runoff mechanisms is offset by the small spatial extent of the storm relative to the catchment size and the shorter storm duration the floods resulting from flashier storms are therefore characterised by lower rcs merz et al 2006 the projection of lower rcs suggests the possibility of either changes in the spatial and temporal distributions of storm rainfalls and or possible future changes in runoff mechanisms resulting from drier antecedent conditions deb et al 2019 tarasova et al 2018 whether decreases in flood event rcs result from drier antecedent conditions alone or are exacerbated by increased storm intensity remains to be determined examining how changes in rainfall losses are partitioned into initial losses those that occur prior to runoff commencing and continuing losses the ongoing average rate of rainfall loss over the remainder of the rainfall event could provide insights into whether runoff mechanisms are changing under climate change stein et al 2020 we hypothesise that a shift towards flashier floods could be identified through decreased initial losses in line with infiltration excess runoff mechanisms or hortonian flow and increased continuing losses due to the catchment being unsaturated analysing flood responses at a sub daily scale would allow for this inquiry and is the focus of future work rising temperatures are also expected to increase the proportion of precipitation that falls as rain rather than snow trenberth 2011 although much of australia already experiences rain dominated precipitation snowfall is critical to planning and management of significant hydropower infrastructure in tasmania and the snowy mountains regions of australia it can therefore be expected that the results presented here will only become more relevant to these regions as well as snow regions globally as temperatures increase further leading to more frequent rainfall driven flood events barnett et al 2005 chegwidden et al 2020 davenport et al 2020 vormoor et al 2016 6 conclusions an analysis of flood event runoff coefficients was used to examine historical trends in runoff responses to precipitation containing the annual water year maximum three day precipitation across 467 unimpaired catchments in australia and to infer potential changes in the runoff response under climate change using an ensemble of results obtained from a landscape water balance model forced by four general circulation models downscaled and bias corrected using four different methods we were able to examine changes in catchment responses to climate change impacts under two scenarios of rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 over the 21st century outputs from the water balance model forced by both historical and projected climate inputs were validated to ensure that the models were fit for purpose the ensemble was found to be credible in 153 of the 346 catchments retained in the analysis of projected changes from these outputs it was found that there is large agreement across the ensemble that the volume of runoff expected from a given volume of precipitation will decrease under climate change across the southern half of australia a region approximating the mid latitudes this is the case for both rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 scenarios considered in both 30 year time periods centred around 2050 and 2085 a decrease is also seen across north east australia for the 2085 period under rcp 4 5 opposing the direction of trends seen historically this study provides insights into the relative changes in runoff responses to precipitation events containing the annual maximum three day precipitation across a continental scale the focus on changes in the relative volumetric flood runoff response to precipitation as opposed to flood peaks affirms that the total volume of precipitation converted to runoff is decreasing across the midlatitudes and has historically been increasing in tropical regions of australia in addition this means that the volumetric rainfall losses and subsequent runoff volumes are changing across australia and are indicative of possible changes in runoff generating mechanisms consequently the representation of rainfall losses used in event based rainfall runoff modelling may need to be revised to consider projected climate change impacts of decreased runoff generation with implications for water supply nguyen et al 2020 future research quantifying rainfall losses will be critical for providing capability in operational flood forecasting and flood design under a changing climate as well as informing catchment water supply credit authorship contribution statement michelle ho

2721,we incorporated aperture variability considering contact obstacles into an ensemble of fractured geothermal reservoir simulations to quantify how variations in this multi scale aperture feature could impact flow field organization and heat transport behavior at the fracture scale this work considered the variability of the correlation length and successfully developed two observational parameters for production prediction our calculations demonstrated that the degree of flow tortuosity was increased by the correlation length which in turn affected heat transport the results showed that using the traditional parallel plate model could overestimate the production temperature and could underestimate the cumulative heat production and these two observation parameters exhibited scale dependence on the correlation length however the plate model with the effective hydraulic aperture inferred from flow could capture the production trend of fractured geothermal reservoirs which indicates that considering a correction coefficient related to the correlation length could effectively improve the prediction accuracy we also found that the cumulative heat production attained a positive logarithmic correlation with the channelized flow area and a linear negative correlation with the flow tortuosity this study contributes to a greater understanding of the uncertainty in

neutrality require reducing carbon dioxide emissions worldwide as a result geothermal energy as clean energy source is expected to play a critical role in reducing carbon emissions menjoz and sauty 1982 moeck 2014 geothermal resources can be recovered through continuous circulation of low temperature fluid in the fractured conduits fu et al 2015 nadimi et al 2020 the heterogeneous distribution of the internal voids in the fracture network and the resultant uneven flow have been confirmed via extensive laboratory tests brown et al 1998 elkhoury et al 2013 gentier et al 1997 ishibashi et al 2012 and field observations hawkins et al 2020 tsang and neretnieks 1998 tsang et al 1991 recently the enhanced geothermal systems egs collab project fu et al 2021 wu et al 2021b wu et al 2021c has observed anomalous transport caused by aperture heterogeneity therefore advancing our understanding of the effects of the aperture variability on the flow field within fractures is critical for analysis and forward modeling in enhanced geothermal energy applications it is well documented that a distinguishing geophysical feature of fractured media is multi scale heterogeneity hyman 2020 hyman et al 2021 zou and cvetkovic 2020 fig 1 shows the multi scale characteristics of fractured geothermal reservoirs the macro flow framework at the network scale is formed by bridging individual fractures associated with fluid transport in the system aliouache et al 2019 huang et al 2019 the fracture aperture exhibits notable anisotropy in various geomechanical and geochemical processes such as stress shear dissolution and sedimentation tsang and neretnieks 1998 the flow field organization within an individual fracture is determined by the aperture field quinn et al 2020 zou and cvetkovic 2021 a conspicuous feature of a heterogeneous aperture is the staggered distribution of contact obstacles and open voids which allows the fluid to select easily passable conduits to form a local flow field nemoto et al 2009 moreover the significant connected flow areas in the fracture cavity constitute so called preferential pathways revealing flow channelization tsang and neretnieks 1998 tsang et al 1991 in addition a series of discrete outflow scenarios e g fig 1d attributed to aperture variation can be widely observed in rock outcrops unfortunately channelized flow indicates that the fluid does not sweep the entire fracture cavity as expected based on the parallel plate model but flows along limited channels consequently high temperature areas in the fracture are not swept by low temperature fluid or are only wetted at a very low speed one of the outstanding questions is how the multi scale aperture heterogeneity affects fluid flow and heat transport processes at the individual fracture scale many previous laboratory heat transfer experiments have confirmed that the roughness of the fracture enhances productivity luo et al 2019 ma et al 2018 furthermore visual experimental devices have allowed researchers to observe the flow structure in rough wall fractures brown et al 1998 li et al 2019 although the term roughness does not reflect the aperture the former is usually referred to as the aperture okoroafor et al 2022 however due to sample size limitations these experimental studies could hardly observe the impact of aperture changes beyond the laboratory scale on the internal flow field recent advances in computational capabilities have provided a simulation framework to test hypotheses regarding the importance of heterogeneity in flow field organization and heat transport in fractures many numerical studies have mainly focused on the influence of the aperture variability on the flow field distribution de dreuzy et al 2012 deng et al 2018 wang et al 2021 particle behavior kang et al 2016 kang et al 2020 sherman et al 2019 normal shear stiffness pyrak nolte et al 2020 equivalent permeability fang et al 2018 sawayama et al 2021 tracer breakthrough curve btc hyman et al 2021 kang et al 2020 and microseismic ishibashi et al 2016 ye and ghassemi 2020 and even nonlinear flow javadi et al 2010 zou et al 2017 in addition the dependence of the aperture distribution and flow channeling on shear behavior has been reported cardona et al 2021 huang et al 2019 zou et al 2017 the intensity of convective heat transfer is closely related to the flow field distribution formed by the aperture variability and ultimately affects the temperature observation at the terminal guo et al 2016 at the laboratory scale okoroafor et al 2022 simulated the effect of the fracture aperture anisotropy on heat transfer and found that the flow wetted surface area significantly contributed to heat extraction liu et al 2021 found that the relationship between the heat transfer coefficient and flow rate in a single rock fracture with a variable aperture could be described via a logarithmic function the coupled model developed by klepikova et al 2021 showed that the thermal front in rough fractures usually moved slower than that in the parallel plate model at the site scale guo et al 2016 performed a reservoir simulation study and found that the reservoir performance decreased with increasing aperture field correlation length bou jaoude et al 2022 reported that solute migration was more greatly affected by a variable aperture than thermal migration and believed that monitoring the concentration rather than the temperature could reveal the heterogeneous aperture field in a single fracture zheng et al 2021 reported that a higher roughness could lead to more obvious preferential paths thus accelerating the thermal breakthrough although experiments and numerical simulations have achieved notable progress quantifying the effect of multi scale apertures on the heat transport in individual fractures remains an important unanswered question in this work we established a horizontally arranged individual fractured reservoir unit model and configured various autocorrelation aperture fields for it these aperture fields contained contact obstacles without losing generality aperture fields with different scale proportions along two orthogonal directions were also considered then we simulated the fluid flow and heat transfer process in the fractured model and compared it to that in the traditional parallel plate model with inferred hydraulic aperture characteristics the effects of multi scale heterogeneous apertures on heat extraction were quantitatively characterized by defining the effective flow area and path tortuosity these simulation results could allow us to better understand the direct relationship between flow channelization and production observations 2 methodology in this section we describe our modeling methodology for the simulation and analysis of flow and heat transfer through fractures with heterogeneous apertures 2 1 representative fractured reservoir unit this work considers a representative fracture unit separated from a fractured geothermal reservoir as shown in fig 2 the length x direction and width y direction of this unit with a height z direction of 8 m are fixed at 20 m the fracture is considered a two dimensional patch after dimensionality reduction liu et al 2021 confirmed that the two dimensional fracture model can replace the three dimensional model when the mesh is dense enough to achieve the research goal a multi scale heterogeneous aperture set is configured on the fracture surface typical fluid flow and heat transfer scenarios of fractured geothermal reservoirs mainly occur in fractures with high conductivity wu et al 2021a thus low temperature fluid is injected into the fracture on the left side y 20 m and heated fluid is extracted from the right side y 0 m after sweeping the fracture void space we mainly focus on the influence of the heterogeneity in the aperture on the heat transfer performance of fractures as a result stress and chemical effects of the system are not included in the current model liquid phase water is the fluid of interest moreover we assume that the water in the reservoir does not experience phase change and the dependence of the thermophysical properties of water on the temperature can be found in our previous studies gao et al 2021 2 2 configuration of the multi scale aperture field previous observations show the autocorrelation of the aperture distribution in the fracture vickers et al 1992 in addition mineral filling and in situ stress extrusion or sliding can lead to partial contact between fracture walls tsang and neretnieks 1998 based on this aspect we configured an ensemble of aperture fields d f x y considering contact obstacles in the fracture model the spatial anisotropy of the aperture field can be determined by the structural parameters of the following exponential covariance function 1 Œ≥ h œÉ 2 exp h where œÉ 2 mm2 is the aperture variance and h is the aspatial separation vector which can be represented by the principal components along the x and y directions as 2 h h x œÜ x 2 h y œÜ y 2 where h x m and h y m are the anisotropic effective separation distances scaled by the correlation lengths œÜ x m and œÜ y m respectively the aperture field can be generated via fourier transform of the covariance function into the power spectral density function of the field thereby creating a random phase spectrum satisfying the real number condition in the physical domain the specific realization process of the aperture field can be found in the works of jose et al 2004 dykaar and kitanidis 1992 and schwede et al 2008 herein the mean aperture d was maintained at 0 2 mm and the variance œÉ 2 was set to 0 04 mm2 the grid size used to generate the aperture field was 0 125 m by adjusting the correlation length scale the multi scale aperture field could be obtained the scenario where the correlation length remains consistent along the x and y directions was defined as case œÜ x y otherwise it was defined as case œÜ x y and referred to as the correlation length ratio case œÜ x y could be regarded as a unique scenario of case œÜ x y in case œÜ x y the longer correlation length direction is called the major range direction while its conjugate direction is called the secondary range direction the aperture field in each case was realized 30 times to ensure the statistical significance of the results to simulate contact obstacles in the fractures we set the local aperture d f to 0 2 Œºm for d f 0 2 Œºm the impact of this process on the characteristics of the aperture field could be ignored considering that all realizations were executed in the same operation table 1 summarizes the simulated scenarios figs 3a 3e exemplify the multi scale heterogeneity aperture fields with increasing œÜ the nonuniformity of the aperture distribution increased and the open area d f 0 2 Œºm and closed area d f 0 2 Œºm increased statistical results of the closed area and open area of all realizations can be found in appendix a the profile of the synthetic aperture in fig 3f shows the variability of the aperture distribution when the correlation length is small e g œÜ x y 0 2 there were many but small preferential channels for fluid flow however larger preferential channels with better connectivity were easier to form in scenes with larger correlation lengths e g œÜ x y 2 note that the reciprocal scenario of case œÜ x y was realized by rotating the aperture field by 90 degrees for example œÜ x y 0 6 1 could be obtained by rotating œÜ x y 1 0 6 in this way we could compare the influence of the sweep direction of the reservoir fluid under the same void structure finally these aperture fields were projected onto the nodes of the fracture surface mesh the aperture values obtained from the mesh nodes were used to reconstruct the aperture field in the numerical model 2 3 flow and heat transfer simulations flow through low permeability fractured rock is typically laminar and darcy s law is an appropriate model to resolve fluid dynamics guo et al 2016 ishibashi et al 2012 fluid flow and heat transfer mainly occur in fractured media which is also the focus of this study consequently we mainly introduced governing equations of flow and heat transfer in fractured media the governing equations in the matrix can be found in the work of aliyu and chen 2017 the flow of fluid in fractured media with d f follows the mass conservation equation 3 d f t œÅ w Œµ f œÑ d f œÅ w u f d f œÜ where œÅ w kg m3 is the density of water Œµ f is the fracture porosity and œÜ kg m3 s is the mass source term moreover u f m s is the darcy velocity in the fracture which is can be determined with darcy s law as follows 4 u f Œ∫ f Œº w œÑ p œÅ w g œÑ h where Œ∫ f m2 is the fracture permeability p pa is the fluid pressure g m s2 is the gravitational acceleration Œº w pa s is the dynamic viscosity of water and h m is the elevation in eq 4 the gravity term is not considered i e œÅ w g h 0 due to the aperture heterogeneity Œ∫ f can be approximately calculated by using a local cubic law zimmerman and bodvarsson 1996 note that the local hydraulic aperture on each grid scale was replaced by the local mechanical aperture guo et al 2016 kang et al 2020 a discussion of the relationship between the two can be found in the work of renshaw 1995 hence the fracture permeability is defined as 5 Œ∫ f d f 2 x y 12 Œ∂ where Œ∂ is the fracture roughness factor witherspoon et al 1979 reported that the value of Œ∂ ranges from 1 04 to 1 65 based on the consistency in research Œ∂ 1 4 was chosen in this work moreover the energy conservation equation in fractured media can be defined as follows 6 d f œÅ c p eff f t t d f œÅ w c p w u f œÑ t œÑ q f d f œï where c p w j kg k is the fluid specific heat capacity t k is the fluid temperature and œï w m3 is the heat source item herein œÅc p eff f j m3 k is the effective volumetric heat capacity of the fractured medium which can be defined as follows 7 œÅ c p eff f 1 Œµ f œÅ f c p f Œµ f œÅ w c p w where œÅ f kg m3 is the fracture density and c p f j m3 k is the specific heat capacity of the fracture in eq 6 q f w m2 is the conductive heat flux of the fracture fluid volume defined as follows 8 q f d f Œª eff f œÑ t where Œª eff f w m k is the effective thermal conductivity of the fractured medium which can be defined as follows 9 Œª eff f Œµ f Œª w 1 Œµ f Œª f where Œª f w m k is the fracture thermal conductivity and Œª w w m k is the thermal conductivity of water in this study the comsol multiphysics simulator was used to solve partial differential equations describing fluid flow and heat transfer in the model previous studies aliyu and chen 2017 klepikova et al 2021 have confirmed that this simulator can suitably simulate the multifield coupling process in a fractured geothermal reservoir 2 4 initial and boundary conditions the boundary conditions of the model are shown in fig 2 all outer boundaries of the model were set as impermeable and thermal insulation boundaries the fracture edge parallel to the pressure gradient direction was set as an impermeable boundary the initial pressure p i was set to 0 mpa a steady state solver was first used to obtain a stable pressure in the model and a time dependent solver was then used to calculate the flow and heat transfer process moreover the initial temperature t i of the model was set to 500 k to simulate high temperature geothermal conditions in addition water was injected at an injection pressure p inj of 1 5 mpa from the left side of the fracture and then pumped out at a production pressure p pro of 1 mpa from the right side to generate a pressure difference p p inj p out of 0 5 mpa to drive water through the fracture based on the work of m√©heust and schmittbuhl 2001 this pressure difference could maintain laminar flow in the fracture the injection temperature t inj of the fluid was fixed at 300 k the general parameters of fractured granite are listed in appendix b note that the values of these parameters are not specific to a particular egs site but can be generally observed in geothermal reservoirs 2 5 model validation to date the numerical solutions of flow and heat transfer in a single fracture obtained with the comsol simulator have been validated against analytical solutions aliyu and chen 2017 and experimental or field investigation data aliyu and archer 2021 he et al 2016 moreover liu et al 2021 and pandey and chaudhuri 2017 successfully used this simulator to simulate the heat transfer process in fractures with heterogeneous apertures therefore the applicability of this simulator is not verified here more importantly the mesh scale of the model must be evaluated to ensure that the flow field distribution in the fracture can be accurately described in particular the mesh scale of fracture surfaces can reflect the spatial heterogeneity in the aperture choosing case œÜ x y 0 2 as an example five scenarios with fracture mesh scales defined as the right angle side length of the triangular mesh of 0 2 0 16 0 13 0 11 and 0 1 m were assessed fig 4 shows the outlet temperature on the 200th day obtained by using these five mesh scales in simulation when the mesh scale was 0 13 m the outlet temperature tended to remain stable hence a mesh scale of 0 13 m was used as a threshold for subsequent simulation studies note that the mesh size of 0 13 m is close to the grid size of 0 125 m which can ensure that the reconstructed aperture field in the numerical model is consistent with that shown in fig 3 3 results 3 1 inferred hydraulic aperture it is very difficult to measure the mechanical aperture distribution at the fracture scale beyond metres consequently the equivalent hydraulic aperture is usually used to characterize the hydraulic properties of fractures in practical hydrological operations however it is still unclear whether the equivalent hydraulic aperture inferred from experimental or theoretical models can be used to estimate thermal production herein we used the prediction models proposed by zimmerman and bodvarsson 1996 eq 10 and yeo 2001 eq 11 respectively to estimate the hydraulic aperture of fractures their prediction models can be expressed as follows 10 d h 3 d 3 1 1 5 std 2 d 2 1 2 Œ¥ 11 d h 3 d 3 1 1 5 std 2 d 2 1 2 4 Œ¥ where d h mm is the hydraulic aperture and std mm is the standard deviation of the aperture the d and std values of the apertures were measured only in conductive areas yeo 2001 Œ¥ is the ratio of the contact obstacles which can be obtained by dividing the closed area appendix a by the fracture area in addition based on the simulated flow through the fracture the cubic law can also be used to invert the equivalent hydraulic aperture as follows 12 d h 12 q f Œº w p 3 where q f m3 s is the flow rate through the fracture which can be expressed by the average flow rate fig 5 shows the inferred hydraulic aperture under different correlation length characteristics the hydraulic aperture inferred from eqs 10 and 11 gradually decreased due to the influence of the contact obstacles the hydraulic aperture inferred from the cubic law captures the hydraulic property difference caused by the aperture heterogeneity note that Œ¥ in eqs 10 and 11 cannot reflect the distribution characteristics of the aperture field hence the hydraulic aperture predictions for fractures with the same aperture distribution are consistent which differs from the predictions obtained with eq 12 as a result the prediction model of zimmerman and bodvarsson 1996 and yeo 2001 may not be applicable to scenarios where the correlation length is disproportionate such as case œÜ x y next these results were incorporated into the fluid flow and heat transfer model to determine whether the inferred hydraulic aperture could also be used in high fidelity heat transfer simulation 3 2 flow field organization characteristics generally the temperature distribution is affected by the flow field organization herein the flow field was normalized using min max normalization fig 6 visualizes the distribution of the normalized flow field in the fracture as expected the streamlines were highly dependent on the interconnected voids the contact obstacles hindered forward flow resulting in a tortuous topology of the streamlines as shown in fig 6 significant flow channelization could be observed in case œÜ x y fig 6 shows a significant phenomenon in which the number of paths available for fluid transport decreased with increasing correlation length scale but the range of an individual path widened the channelization geometry evolved from thin and many braids to wide and few ribbons in case œÜ x y the visualization of the streamline and flow field distributions revealed two distinct geometric configurations the flow field organization depends on the parallel or vertical relationship between the major range direction and the flow direction when the major range direction is orthogonal to the flow direction e g œÜ x y 1 0 6 2 1 and 2 0 6 the multilevel horizontal contact obstacles block the flow field forcing the fluid to bypass the contact obstacles on both sides therefore the flow channeling phenomenon reveals a zigzag pattern however when their directions are parallel e g œÜ x y 0 6 1 1 2 and 0 6 2 the long and narrow voids and the contact obstacles provide unobstructed path and lateral flow constraints respectively therefore the shape of the area where dominant flow occurs resembles a relatively straight belt fig 6 shows that the flow field is not only related to the extension scale of the contact obstacles but also related to its extension proportion the travel path of low temperature fluid in the fracture can affect whether the fluid is fully heated we used the tortuosity œà to quantify the degree of curvature of the flow path indicated by the streamlines which can be defined as follows 13 œà l f l where l f m is the length of each streamline and l m is the linear length of the fracture inlet and outlet l 20 m the tortuosity of the streamlines generated with the parallel plate model is 1 empirical cumulative distribution functions cdfs for all realizations are shown in fig 7 to quantitatively illustrate the impact of the correlation length on the simulated tortuosity distributions as shown in fig 7a the slope of the cdf curve in case œÜ x y exhibited a slight increase with increasing correlation length note that this relationship weakens when the correlation length exceeds 1 m in general the average tortuosity ranges from 1 to 1 65 fig 7b shows that the cdf varies due to the inconsistency between the extension scales of the correlation length along the x and y directions moreover the slope of the cdf gradually decreased with increasing correlation length ratio here cases œÜ x y could be regarded as œÜ x y 1 in the case of œÜ x y 2 0 6 the tortuosity could reach 2 5 and the corresponding streamline length was 50 m a low tortuosity suggests that the fluid can pass through the fracture faster while a high tortuosity indicates that the fluid can remain in the fracture for a long time next we quantified the area of channelized flow by determining a cut off flow value we defined the total watershed area where the flow value at the fracture surface exceeds the cut off flow value as the effective flow area a eff m2 which could be considered as the main area where severe convective heat transfer occurs fig 8 shows the evolution of the effective flow area for different cut off flows each cut off flow solution is provided with a visual subgraph of case œÜ x y 1 to compare the distribution of the effective flow area the effective flow area logarithmically decreased with increasing cut off flow which is consistent with the research results of okoroafor et al 2022 note that all cases showed a similar logarithmic decline and only two examples are given here for clarity at low cut off flow values such as 10 7 m2 s the effective flow area included some areas where flow channelization did not occur indicating that the effective flow area may be overestimated in contrast under the 10 5 m2 s scenario the effective flow area may be underestimated because part of the flow channelization structure was not captured notably the green marked area and the grey effective flow area did not coincide here we adopt a cut off flow value of 5e 6 m2 s as an example to explain how the correlation length of the aperture field affects the effective flow area as shown in fig 9 when the correlation length ratio is 1 i e case œÜ x y the effective flow area first significantly decreases at the small correlation length scale and then tends to remain stable with increasing correlation length scale this is expected because as the correlation length scale is reduced more open areas appendix a are generated and eventually degenerate into parallel plate models once the correlation length ratio differs from 1 i e case œÜ x y the effective flow area decreases with increasing correlation length ratio in addition the effective flow area in case œÜ x y is closely related to the major range direction for example although the aperture distributions in cases œÜ x y 0 6 2 and œÜ x y 2 0 6 are consistent there is a statistically significant difference in the effective flow area in conclusion the correlation length scale is the main factor affecting the effective flow area when there is no main aperture field range otherwise the major range direction is the main influencing factor 3 3 temperature observables fig 10 shows examples of the simulated temperature distributions on the fracture walls the distribution of the fracture wall temperature is affected by the hydraulic heterogeneity conditions fig 6 the temperature decline in the area where flow channelization occurs fig 6 is very significant it can be observed that the low temperature front moves forward in an irregular manner showing a tailing phenomenon moreover we can observe that some residual high temperature regions rhtrs emerged on the fracture wall due to the low permeability of the contact obstacles the presence of an rhtr suggests that local geothermal energy resources have not been fully extracted which is one of the sources of production uncertainty furthermore the increase in the correlation length reflects two characteristics 1 the low temperature area dark colour on the fracture surface changes from slender and tortuous to wide and smooth 2 the rhtr extent is expanded however these phenomena are not observed in the traditional parallel plate model the results show that if the spatial variability of the voids in individual fractures is ignored the productivity predictions of geothermal reservoirs using the parallel plate model may be unacceptable we calculated the average temperature at the outlet which is referred to as the production temperature t pro all samples are shown in fig 11a note that the parallel plate model with a constant aperture was used as input considering the narrow range of hydraulic apertures inferred from eqs 10 and 11 only the upper limit the black dotted line in fig 11a and lower limit the green dotted line in fig 11a of the simulated production temperature are given here the hydraulic aperture inferred from the cubic law eq 12 exhibits a wide range so the average value was used as a representative simulation value to obtain the production temperature the dark red dashed line in fig 11a in case œÜ x y the standard deviation std of the production temperature increased from 1 567 k to 12 322 k with increasing correlation length moreover the coefficient of variation cv the ratio between the standard deviation and mean increased from 0 0048 and 0 0023 to 0 035 and 0 0235 respectively indicating that the production temperature variability became increasingly significant in case œÜ x y the horizontally distributed contact obstacles prolonged the travel path figs 6 and 7 of the heat transfer fluid and significantly increased the production temperature furthermore the increase in the correlation length ratio also led to an increase in cv from 0 0133 to 0 0739 the production temperature characteristic values of all samples are listed in table 2 the production temperature simulated with a constant aperture attained a negative correlation with the aperture e g chen et al 2018b it could be observed that the simulated production temperature of both the hydraulic aperture inferred from eqs 10 and 11 and the average mechanical aperture was lower than that of the heterogeneous model fig 11b further shows the correlation between the production temperature and the correlation length scale at 200 days it could be observed that the maximum production temperature error between the parallel plate model and the heterogeneous model reached 55 99 the correlation length ratio increased from 0 6 2 to 2 0 6 case œÜ x y is considered here and the corresponding average production temperature increased from 325 k to 425 k showing a positive correlation as a result the degree of underestimation of the average production temperature of the heterogeneous model by the parallel plate model increased from 5 03 to 27 16 once this underestimation exceeds the developer s acceptable tolerance the parallel plate model is no longer suitable for replacing the heterogeneous model moreover in case œÜ x y the production temperature increased with increasing correlation length scale interestingly although the parallel plate model with the hydraulic aperture inferred from the cubic law still underestimated the production temperature it could capture the variable relationship between the production temperature simulated with the heterogeneous model and the correlation length scale therefore a correction coefficient related to the correlation length scale was introduced to compensate for this underestimation and the expression is as follows 14 t pro Œ± t pre where Œ± is the correction coefficient related to the correlation length scale and t pre k is the production temperature predicted with the hydraulic aperture model 3 4 scale dependence of the cumulative heat production the cumulative heat production e pro represents the total heat energy extracted from the fractured reservoir unit by the circulating fluid and can be obtained as follows 15 e pro q pro œÅ w c p w t pro t inj dt where q pro m3 s is the flow rate at the outlet and t s is the time step of the solution fig 12 reports the cumulative heat production of all samples including a parallel plate model with a constant aperture the relationship between the cumulative heat production and the correlation length scale was the opposite to the temperature evolution trend shown in fig 11 because the temperature difference t pro t inj in eq 15 contributed more significantly to the cumulative heat production than the product term of the mass flow rate and the specific heat capacity q pro œÅ w c p w in eq 15 similar to the temperature observation fig 11 the increase in the correlation length scale enhanced the observation uncertainty in the cumulative heat production the parallel plate model with an average mechanical aperture overestimated the cumulative heat production and the overestimation rate based on the mean varied between 10 07 and 79 13 the degree of overestimation increased with increasing correlation length ratio however the parallel plate model with the hydraulic aperture inferred from eqs 10 and 11 could obtain a prediction interval with a lower limit e min of 3 95 1011 j and an upper limit e max of 4 78 1011 j this interval effectively includes cases with small correlation length scales such as œÜ x y 0 2 0 6 and œÜ x y 0 6 1 1 2 0 6 2 in contrast to fig 11 although the hydraulic aperture inferred from the cubic law also captured the evolution trend of the cumulative heat production with the correlation length it significantly underestimated the cumulative heat production similarly a more accurate prediction result can be obtained by using the following equation 16 e pro Œ≤ e pre where Œ≤ is the correction coefficient related to the correlation length scale and e pre j is the cumulative heat production predicted with the hydraulic aperture model we used a logarithmic regression model to fit the relationship between the effective flow area open area a o and cumulative heat production a parallel plate model with an average mechanical aperture of 0 2 mm was considered an extreme scenario of the heterogeneous model the influence of different cut off flow values on the fitting results was also considered the logarithmic regression model used can be defined as follows 17 e pro a b ln a c where a b and c are coefficients and a m2 is the area all fitting results are shown in fig 13 because a low cut off flow contains non dominant flow channels fig 8 the cumulative heat production and effective flow area showed a weak correlation r2 0 5 in contrary a high cut off flow strictly captures channelized flow thus obtaining a fitting effect with a suitable correlation compared to case œÜ x y the fitting effect of case œÜ x y was better probably because the effective surface area is strongly affected by the œÜ x y but much less so by the œÜ x y fig 9 the fitting results in fig 13a reveal the strong correlation between the cumulative heat production and channelized flow and confirm that the preferential flow channels are the main location for heat energy extraction as a result the effective flow area could be used as a tool to estimate the thermal output of fractured reservoir units furthermore although the fluid mainly passes through the voids in the fractures fig 13b shows that there exists no satisfactory correlation between the open area and the cumulative heat production this result shows that the contact obstacles and open voids are not the main factors affecting the difference in heat extraction but the resultant specific channelized flow in other words directly using the measured or inverted aperture distribution to predict thermal energy production may possibly be unreliable finally we examined the dependence of the cumulative heat production on the tortuosity fig 7 the linear fitting results of the 10th 25th 50th median 75th and 90th percentiles of the tortuosity set are shown in fig 14 in addition the mean tortuosity was considered these percentiles represent relatively low 10 and 25 moderate 50 and mean and relatively high 75 and 90 values of the tortuosity the correlation between the tortuosity and correlation length scale is shown in fig 7 fig 14 shows that a general trend is that the cumulative heat energy decreased with increasing tortuosity i e e pro œà 1 except for the 10th and 25th percentiles the r2 value of the other statistics to be assessed exceeded 0 5 the percentile fitting effect characterized by r2 emphasized the applicability of different percentile tortuosity data because streamline length statistics do not provide flow information the fitting effect is worse than that using the effective flow area it should be pointed out that whether the effective flow area or tortuosity is used as the prediction tool the specific engineering parameters related to the geothermal field such as the reservoir temperature injection flow fracture size and operation time should be used for the basic calibration model 4 discussion the numerical simulations visualized the flow field structure and temperature distribution on the fracture surface we defined the effective flow area and tortuosity to quantify the influence of flow channelization on the thermal energy production of fractured reservoir units compared to the parallel plate hypothesis the heterogeneous model with a variable aperture allowed the fluid to choose the dominant interconnected path thus forming a flow field organization with a significant channeled flow fig 6 as anticipated this understanding is generally consistent with previous experimental chen et al 2018a ishibashi et al 2012 and numerical nemoto et al 2009 wang et al 2021 studies furthermore the temperature observations showed the uncertainty due to flow channelization the simulation results revealed a positive correlation between the production temperature in a single fracture and the correlation length scale of the aperture field fig 11 which may provide insight into the use of temperature observations to estimate the anisotropy information of the aperture field however according to the work of guo et al 2016 the production temperature decreases with increasing correlation length the possible reason is that their fracture model did not consider contact obstacles this work demonstrated that the parallel plate model with the measured aperture underestimated and overestimated the production temperature fig 11 and cumulative heat production fig 12 respectively with the heterogeneous model interestingly when the correlation length was small or the flow direction was parallel to the major range direction the simulation results under a constant aperture were close to those of the heterogeneous model hence the parallel plate model may be acceptable when the ratio of the fracture scale to the correlation length exceeds a certain threshold moreover the cumulative heat production of heterogeneous models with a smaller correlation length scale can be predicted with a maximum error of 21 using the inferential models of zimmerman and bodvarsson 1996 and yeo 2001 although both could significantly underestimate the production temperature the production temperature and cumulative heat production of the heterogeneous model were significantly underestimated by the hydraulic aperture model inferred by the cubic law however the fluctuation in the heat extraction performance of the heterogeneous model with the correlation length could be captured by the hydraulic aperture model which illustrates the importance of hydraulic properties e g klepikova et al 2021 we propose to use the correction coefficient related to the correlation length to correct this underestimation therefore the fracture hydraulic properties provided by flow tests laboratory or field should be preferentially used instead of directly using the hypothetical input of the mean mechanical aperture the results also showed that the cumulative heat production could be predicted by a logarithmic relationship fig 13 using the effective flow area reflecting flow channelization similar to this result okoroafor et al 2022 obtained a linear relationship from a centimetre scale fracture model another prediction tool is the tortuosity fig 14 which exhibits a linear negative correlation with the cumulative heat production generally field operators can obtain basic information on reservoir fractures such as the mean variance roughness and contact rate of the aperture through formation micro scanner images fmis or laboratory simulations e g cardona et al 2021 hyman et al 2021 in addition the size and orientation of fractures can be estimated via inversion of microseismic data although the above data are far from sufficient for accurate simulation predictions they can be used as basic model input herein we developed a workflow to illustrate how to use the proposed prediction tool first the mean aperture was used in the fracture model and a parallel plate benchmark model was obtained by incorporating the temperature pressure conditions of geothermal reservoirs second a series of multi scale aperture fields were simulated by using the measured aperture mean variance and arbitrarily set correlation length with the use of these multi scale aperture fields prediction curves based on the effective flow area fig 13 and tortuosity fig 14 could be fitted finally using the fracture active area an approximation of the effective flow area or breakthrough time inverted from the results of tracer tests involving multiple tracers an acceptable prediction could be given by the prediction curve here compared to the tortuosity it is difficult to obtain the effective flow area however a combination of combined injection testing tracer testing electrical resistivity tomography ert testing or time variation flow and temperature based testing may provide a solution for obtaining the effective flow area in a fracture it must be mentioned that there are still some limitations related to this work including neglecting the dependence of the aperture field on the in situ stress and thermal stress in future work the in situ stress will be incorporated into the model focusing on understanding the development of the heat transport process caused by shear dilatancy in addition we will also explore the impact of the mutual configuration of the modeling scale and correlation length on the observation results to solve the problem of productivity prediction of multi scale fractured geothermal reservoirs 5 conclusions in this study we investigated the impact of the aperture heterogeneity on the heat transport behavior in a medium scale fracture unit considering the multi scale characteristics of the correlation length and potential contact obstacles the most important conclusions in this work can be summarized as follows the dispersion degree of production observations of fractured reservoir units depends on the correlation length of the variable aperture the flow channel structure develops from thin and numerous braids to wide and fewer bands with increasing correlation length the correlation length scale is the main factor that affects the channelized flow structure in the case of no major range otherwise the main factor is the main range direction that determines how the contact obstacles cut off the flow field the parallel plate model with the average mechanical aperture and inferred equivalent hydraulic aperture underestimates the production temperature of the heterogeneous aperture model and the underestimation increases with the correlation length scale and ratio however the equivalent hydraulic aperture model inferred from the cubic law captures the variable evolution trend of the observed results obtained with the heterogeneous model therefore the hydraulic aperture model inferred from the flow tests can compensate for the underestimation of the heterogeneous model via a correction coefficient related to the correlation length flow channelization can be quantitatively characterized by the effective flow area and tortuosity both can be used as prediction tools to predict the cumulative heat production of fractured reservoir units through logarithmic and linear models respectively in general both the effective flow area and the tortuosity are negatively correlated with the correlation length scale ratio credit authorship contribution statement xuefeng gao conceptualization investigation formal analysis

2721,we incorporated aperture variability considering contact obstacles into an ensemble of fractured geothermal reservoir simulations to quantify how variations in this multi scale aperture feature could impact flow field organization and heat transport behavior at the fracture scale this work considered the variability of the correlation length and successfully developed two observational parameters for production prediction our calculations demonstrated that the degree of flow tortuosity was increased by the correlation length which in turn affected heat transport the results showed that using the traditional parallel plate model could overestimate the production temperature and could underestimate the cumulative heat production and these two observation parameters exhibited scale dependence on the correlation length however the plate model with the effective hydraulic aperture inferred from flow could capture the production trend of fractured geothermal reservoirs which indicates that considering a correction coefficient related to the correlation length could effectively improve the prediction accuracy we also found that the cumulative heat production attained a positive logarithmic correlation with the channelized flow area and a linear negative correlation with the flow tortuosity this study contributes to a greater understanding of the uncertainty in

neutrality require reducing carbon dioxide emissions worldwide as a result geothermal energy as clean energy source is expected to play a critical role in reducing carbon emissions menjoz and sauty 1982 moeck 2014 geothermal resources can be recovered through continuous circulation of low temperature fluid in the fractured conduits fu et al 2015 nadimi et al 2020 the heterogeneous distribution of the internal voids in the fracture network and the resultant uneven flow have been confirmed via extensive laboratory tests brown et al 1998 elkhoury et al 2013 gentier et al 1997 ishibashi et al 2012 and field observations hawkins et al 2020 tsang and neretnieks 1998 tsang et al 1991 recently the enhanced geothermal systems egs collab project fu et al 2021 wu et al 2021b wu et al 2021c has observed anomalous transport caused by aperture heterogeneity therefore advancing our understanding of the effects of the aperture variability on the flow field within fractures is critical for analysis and forward modeling in enhanced geothermal energy applications it is well documented that a distinguishing geophysical feature of fractured media is multi scale heterogeneity hyman 2020 hyman et al 2021 zou and cvetkovic 2020 fig 1 shows the multi scale characteristics of fractured geothermal reservoirs the macro flow framework at the network scale is formed by bridging individual fractures associated with fluid transport in the system aliouache et al 2019 huang et al 2019 the fracture aperture exhibits notable anisotropy in various geomechanical and geochemical processes such as stress shear dissolution and sedimentation tsang and neretnieks 1998 the flow field organization within an individual fracture is determined by the aperture field quinn et al 2020 zou and cvetkovic 2021 a conspicuous feature of a heterogeneous aperture is the staggered distribution of contact obstacles and open voids which allows the fluid to select easily passable conduits to form a local flow field nemoto et al 2009 moreover the significant connected flow areas in the fracture cavity constitute so called preferential pathways revealing flow channelization tsang and neretnieks 1998 tsang et al 1991 in addition a series of discrete outflow scenarios e g fig 1d attributed to aperture variation can be widely observed in rock outcrops unfortunately channelized flow indicates that the fluid does not sweep the entire fracture cavity as expected based on the parallel plate model but flows along limited channels consequently high temperature areas in the fracture are not swept by low temperature fluid or are only wetted at a very low speed one of the outstanding questions is how the multi scale aperture heterogeneity affects fluid flow and heat transport processes at the individual fracture scale many previous laboratory heat transfer experiments have confirmed that the roughness of the fracture enhances productivity luo et al 2019 ma et al 2018 furthermore visual experimental devices have allowed researchers to observe the flow structure in rough wall fractures brown et al 1998 li et al 2019 although the term roughness does not reflect the aperture the former is usually referred to as the aperture okoroafor et al 2022 however due to sample size limitations these experimental studies could hardly observe the impact of aperture changes beyond the laboratory scale on the internal flow field recent advances in computational capabilities have provided a simulation framework to test hypotheses regarding the importance of heterogeneity in flow field organization and heat transport in fractures many numerical studies have mainly focused on the influence of the aperture variability on the flow field distribution de dreuzy et al 2012 deng et al 2018 wang et al 2021 particle behavior kang et al 2016 kang et al 2020 sherman et al 2019 normal shear stiffness pyrak nolte et al 2020 equivalent permeability fang et al 2018 sawayama et al 2021 tracer

of the aperture distribution and flow channeling on shear behavior has been reported cardona et al 2021 huang et al 2019 zou et al 2017 the intensity of convective heat transfer is closely related to the flow field distribution formed by the aperture variability and ultimately affects the temperature observation at the terminal guo et al 2016 at the laboratory scale okoroafor et al 2022 simulated the effect of the fracture aperture anisotropy on heat transfer and found that the flow wetted surface area significantly contributed to heat extraction liu et al 2021 found that the relationship between the heat transfer coefficient and flow rate in a single rock fracture with a variable aperture could be described via a logarithmic function the coupled model developed by klepikova et al 2021 showed that the thermal front in rough fractures usually moved slower than that in the parallel plate model at the site scale guo et al 2016 performed a reservoir simulation study and found that the reservoir performance decreased with increasing aperture field correlation length bou jaoude et al 2022 reported that solute migration was more greatly affected by a variable aperture than thermal migration and believed that monitoring the concentration rather than the temperature could reveal the heterogeneous aperture field in a single fracture zheng et al 2021 reported that a higher roughness could lead to more obvious preferential paths thus accelerating the thermal breakthrough although experiments and numerical simulations have achieved notable progress quantifying the effect of multi scale apertures on the heat transport in individual fractures remains an important unanswered question in this work we established a horizontally arranged individual fractured reservoir unit model and configured various autocorrelation aperture fields for it these aperture fields contained contact obstacles without losing generality aperture fields with different scale proportions along two orthogonal directions were also considered then we simulated the fluid flow and heat transfer process in the fractured model and compared it to that in the traditional parallel plate model with inferred hydraulic aperture characteristics the effects of multi scale heterogeneous apertures on heat extraction were quantitatively characterized by defining the effective flow area and path tortuosity these simulation results could allow us to better understand the direct relationship between flow channelization and production observations 2 methodology in this section we describe our modeling methodology for the simulation and analysis of flow and heat transfer through fractures with heterogeneous apertures 2 1 representative fractured reservoir unit this work considers a representative fracture unit separated from a fractured geothermal reservoir as shown in fig 2 the length x direction and width y direction of this unit with a height z direction of 8 m are fixed at 20 m the fracture is considered a two dimensional patch after dimensionality reduction liu et al 2021 confirmed that the two dimensional fracture model can replace the three dimensional model when the mesh is dense enough to achieve the research goal a multi scale heterogeneous aperture set is configured on the fracture surface typical fluid flow and heat transfer scenarios of fractured geothermal reservoirs mainly occur in fractures with high conductivity wu et al 2021a thus low temperature fluid is injected into the fracture on the left side y 20 m and heated fluid is extracted from the right side y 0 m after sweeping the fracture void space we mainly focus on the influence of the heterogeneity in the aperture on the heat transfer performance of fractures as a result stress and chemical effects of the system are not included in the current model liquid phase water is the fluid of interest moreover we assume that the water in the reservoir does not experience phase change and the dependence of the thermophysical properties of water on the temperature can be found in our previous studies gao et al 2021 2 2 configuration of the multi scale aperture field previous observations show the autocorrelation of the aperture distribution in the fracture vickers et al 1992 in addition mineral filling and in situ stress extrusion or sliding can lead to partial contact between fracture walls tsang and neretnieks 1998 based on this aspect we configured an ensemble of aperture fields d f x y considering contact obstacles in the fracture model the spatial anisotropy of the aperture field can be determined by the structural parameters of the following exponential covariance function 1 Œ≥ h œÉ 2 exp h where œÉ 2 mm2 is the aperture variance and h is the aspatial separation vector which can be represented by the principal components along the x and y directions as 2 h h x œÜ x 2 h y œÜ y 2 where h x m and h y m are the anisotropic effective separation distances scaled by the correlation lengths œÜ x m and œÜ y m respectively the aperture field can be generated via fourier transform of the covariance function into the power spectral density function of the field thereby creating a random phase spectrum satisfying the real number condition in the physical domain the specific realization process of the aperture field can be found in the works of jose et al 2004 dykaar and kitanidis 1992 and schwede et al 2008 herein the mean aperture d was maintained at 0 2 mm and the variance œÉ 2 was set to 0 04 mm2 the grid size used to generate the aperture field was 0 125 m by adjusting the correlation length scale the multi scale aperture field could be obtained the scenario where the correlation length remains consistent along the x and y directions was defined as case œÜ x y otherwise it was defined as case œÜ x y and referred to as the correlation length ratio case œÜ x y could be regarded as a unique scenario of case œÜ x y in case œÜ x y the longer correlation length direction is called the major range direction while its conjugate direction is called the secondary range direction the aperture field in each case was realized 30 times to ensure the statistical significance of the results to simulate contact obstacles in the fractures we set the local aperture d f to 0 2 Œºm for d f 0 2 Œºm the impact of this process on the characteristics of the aperture field could be ignored considering that all realizations were executed in the same operation table 1 summarizes the simulated scenarios figs 3a 3e exemplify the multi scale heterogeneity aperture fields with increasing œÜ the nonuniformity of the aperture distribution increased and the open area d f 0 2 Œºm and closed area d f 0 2 Œºm increased statistical results of the closed area and open area of all realizations can be found in appendix a the profile of the synthetic aperture in fig 3f shows the variability of the aperture distribution when the correlation length is small e g œÜ x y 0 2 there were many but small preferential channels for fluid flow however larger preferential channels with better connectivity were easier to form in scenes with larger correlation lengths e g œÜ x y 2 note that the reciprocal scenario of case œÜ x y was realized by rotating the aperture field by 90 degrees for example œÜ x y 0 6 1 could be obtained by rotating œÜ x y 1 0 6 in this way we could compare the influence of the sweep direction of the reservoir fluid under the same void structure finally these aperture fields were projected onto the nodes of the fracture surface mesh the aperture values obtained from the mesh nodes were used to reconstruct the aperture field in the numerical model 2 3 flow and heat transfer simulations flow through low permeability fractured rock is typically laminar and darcy s law is an appropriate model to resolve fluid dynamics guo et al 2016 ishibashi et al 2012 fluid flow and heat transfer mainly occur in fractured media which is also the focus of this study consequently we mainly introduced governing equations of flow and heat transfer in fractured media the governing equations in the matrix can be found in the work of aliyu and chen 2017 the flow of fluid in fractured media with d f follows the mass conservation equation 3 d f t œÅ w Œµ f œÑ d f œÅ w u f d f œÜ where œÅ w kg m3 is the density of water Œµ f is the fracture porosity and œÜ kg m3 s is the mass source term moreover u f m s is the darcy velocity in the fracture which is can be determined with darcy s law as follows 4 u f Œ∫ f Œº w œÑ p œÅ w g œÑ h where Œ∫ f m2 is the fracture permeability p pa is the fluid pressure g m s2 is the gravitational acceleration Œº w pa s is the dynamic viscosity of water and h m is the elevation in eq 4 the gravity term is not considered i e œÅ w g h 0 due to the aperture heterogeneity Œ∫ f can be approximately calculated by using a local cubic law zimmerman and bodvarsson 1996 note that the local hydraulic aperture on each grid scale was replaced by the local mechanical aperture guo et al 2016 kang et al 2020 a discussion of the relationship between the two can be found in the work of renshaw 1995 hence the fracture permeability is defined as 5 Œ∫ f d f 2 x y 12 Œ∂ where Œ∂ is the fracture roughness factor witherspoon et al 1979 reported that the value of Œ∂ ranges from 1 04 to 1 65 based on the consistency in research Œ∂ 1 4 was chosen in this work moreover the energy conservation equation in fractured media can be defined as follows 6 d f œÅ c p eff f t t d f œÅ w c p w u f œÑ t œÑ q f d f œï where c p w j kg k is the fluid specific heat capacity t k is the fluid temperature and œï w m3 is the heat source item herein œÅc p eff f j m3 k is the effective volumetric heat capacity of the fractured medium which can be defined as follows 7 œÅ c p eff f 1 Œµ f œÅ f c p f Œµ f œÅ w c p w where œÅ f kg m3 is the fracture density and c p f j m3 k is the specific heat capacity of the fracture in eq 6 q f w m2 is the conductive heat flux of the fracture fluid volume defined as follows 8 q f d f Œª eff f œÑ t where Œª eff f w m k is the effective thermal conductivity of the fractured medium which can be defined as follows 9 Œª eff f Œµ f Œª w 1 Œµ f Œª f where Œª f w m k is the fracture thermal conductivity and Œª w w m k is the thermal conductivity of water in this study the comsol multiphysics simulator was used to solve partial differential equations describing fluid flow and heat transfer in the model previous studies aliyu and chen 2017 klepikova et al 2021 have confirmed that this simulator can suitably simulate the multifield coupling process in a fractured geothermal reservoir 2 4 initial and boundary conditions the boundary conditions of the model are shown in fig 2 all outer boundaries of the model were set as impermeable and thermal insulation boundaries the fracture edge parallel to the pressure gradient direction was set as an impermeable boundary the initial pressure p i was set to 0 mpa a steady state solver was first used to obtain a stable pressure in the model and a time dependent solver was then used to calculate the flow and heat transfer process moreover the initial temperature t i of the model was set to 500 k to simulate high temperature geothermal conditions in addition water was injected at an injection pressure p inj of 1 5 mpa from the left side of the fracture and then pumped out at a production pressure p pro of 1 mpa from the right side to generate a pressure difference p p inj p out of 0 5 mpa to drive water through the fracture based on the work of m√©heust and schmittbuhl 2001 this pressure difference could maintain laminar flow in the fracture the injection temperature t inj of the fluid was fixed at 300 k the general parameters of fractured granite are listed in appendix b note that the values of these parameters are not specific to a particular egs site but can be generally observed in geothermal reservoirs 2 5 model validation to date the numerical solutions of flow and heat transfer in a single fracture obtained with the comsol simulator have been validated against analytical solutions aliyu and chen 2017 and experimental or field investigation data aliyu and archer 2021 he et al 2016 moreover liu et al 2021 and pandey and chaudhuri 2017 successfully used this simulator to simulate the heat transfer process in fractures with heterogeneous apertures therefore the applicability of this simulator is not verified here more importantly the mesh scale of the model must be evaluated to ensure that the flow field distribution in the fracture can be accurately described in particular the mesh scale of fracture surfaces can reflect the spatial heterogeneity in the aperture choosing case œÜ x y 0 2 as an example five scenarios with fracture mesh scales defined as the right angle side length of the triangular mesh of 0 2 0 16 0 13 0 11 and 0 1 m were assessed fig 4 shows the outlet temperature on the 200th day obtained by using these five mesh scales in simulation when the mesh scale was 0 13 m the outlet temperature tended to remain stable hence a mesh scale of 0 13 m was used as a threshold for subsequent simulation studies note that the mesh size of 0 13 m is close to the grid size of 0 125 m which can ensure that the reconstructed aperture field in the numerical model is consistent with that shown in fig 3 3 results 3 1 inferred hydraulic aperture it is very difficult to measure the mechanical aperture distribution at the fracture scale beyond metres consequently the equivalent hydraulic aperture is usually used to characterize the hydraulic properties of fractures in practical hydrological operations however it is still unclear whether the equivalent hydraulic aperture inferred from experimental or theoretical models can be used to estimate thermal production herein we used the prediction models proposed by zimmerman and bodvarsson 1996 eq 10 and yeo 2001 eq 11 respectively to estimate the hydraulic aperture of fractures their prediction models can be expressed as follows 10 d h 3 d 3 1 1 5 std 2 d 2 1 2 Œ¥ 11 d h 3 d 3 1 1 5 std 2 d 2 1 2 4 Œ¥ where d h mm is the hydraulic aperture and std mm is the standard deviation of the aperture the d and std values of the apertures were measured only in conductive areas yeo 2001 Œ¥ is the ratio of the contact obstacles which can be obtained by dividing the closed area appendix a by the fracture area in addition based on the simulated flow through the fracture the cubic law can also be used to invert the equivalent hydraulic aperture as follows 12 d h 12 q f Œº w p 3 where q f m3 s is the flow rate through the fracture which can be expressed by the average flow rate fig 5 shows the inferred hydraulic aperture under different correlation length characteristics the hydraulic aperture inferred from eqs 10 and 11 gradually decreased due to the influence of the contact obstacles the hydraulic aperture inferred from the cubic law captures the hydraulic property difference caused by the aperture heterogeneity note that Œ¥ in eqs 10 and 11 cannot reflect the distribution characteristics of the aperture field hence the hydraulic aperture predictions for fractures with the same aperture distribution are consistent which differs from the predictions obtained with eq 12 as a result the prediction model of zimmerman and bodvarsson 1996 and yeo 2001 may not be applicable to scenarios where the correlation length is disproportionate such as case œÜ x y next these results were incorporated into the fluid flow and heat transfer model to determine whether the inferred hydraulic aperture could also be used in high fidelity heat transfer simulation 3 2 flow field organization characteristics generally the temperature distribution is affected by the flow field organization herein the flow field was normalized using min max normalization fig 6 visualizes the distribution of the normalized flow field in the fracture as expected the streamlines were highly dependent on the interconnected voids the contact obstacles hindered forward flow resulting in a tortuous topology of the streamlines as shown in fig 6 significant flow channelization could be observed in case œÜ x y fig 6 shows a significant phenomenon in which the number of paths available for fluid transport decreased with increasing correlation length scale but the range of an individual path widened the channelization geometry evolved from thin and many braids to wide and few ribbons in case œÜ x y the visualization of the streamline and flow field distributions revealed two distinct geometric configurations the flow field organization depends on the parallel or vertical relationship between the major range direction and the flow direction when the major range direction is orthogonal to the flow direction e g œÜ x y 1 0 6 2 1 and 2 0 6 the multilevel horizontal contact obstacles block the flow field forcing the fluid to bypass the contact obstacles on both sides therefore the flow channeling phenomenon reveals a zigzag pattern however when their directions are parallel e g œÜ x y 0 6 1 1 2 and 0 6 2 the long and narrow voids and the contact obstacles provide unobstructed path and lateral flow constraints respectively therefore the shape of the area where dominant flow occurs resembles a relatively straight belt fig 6 shows that the flow field is not only related to the extension scale of the contact obstacles but also related to its extension proportion the travel path of low temperature fluid in the fracture can affect whether the fluid is fully heated we used the tortuosity œà to quantify the degree of curvature of the flow path indicated by the streamlines which can be defined as follows 13 œà l f l where l f m is the length of each streamline and l m is the linear length of the fracture inlet and outlet l 20 m the tortuosity of the streamlines generated with the parallel plate model is 1 empirical cumulative distribution functions cdfs for all realizations are shown in fig 7 to quantitatively illustrate the impact of the correlation length on the simulated tortuosity distributions as shown in fig 7a the slope of the cdf curve in case œÜ x y exhibited a slight increase with increasing correlation length note that this relationship weakens when the correlation length exceeds 1 m in general the average tortuosity ranges from 1 to 1 65 fig 7b shows that the cdf varies due to the inconsistency between the extension scales of the correlation length along the x and y directions moreover the slope of the cdf gradually decreased with increasing correlation length ratio here cases œÜ x y could be regarded as œÜ x y 1 in the case of œÜ x y 2 0 6 the tortuosity could reach 2 5 and the corresponding streamline length was 50 m a low tortuosity suggests that the fluid can pass through the fracture faster while a high tortuosity indicates that the fluid can remain in the fracture for a long time next we quantified the area of channelized flow by determining a cut off flow value we defined the total watershed area where the flow value at the fracture surface exceeds the cut off flow value as the effective flow area a eff m2 which could be considered as the main area where severe convective heat transfer occurs fig 8 shows the evolution of the effective flow area for different cut off flows each cut off flow solution is provided with a visual subgraph of case œÜ x y 1 to compare the distribution of the effective flow area the effective flow area logarithmically decreased with increasing cut off flow which is consistent with the research results of okoroafor et al 2022 note that all cases showed a similar logarithmic decline and only two examples are given here for clarity at low cut off flow values such as 10 7 m2 s the effective flow area included some areas where flow channelization did not occur indicating that the effective flow area may be overestimated in contrast under the 10 5 m2 s scenario the effective flow area may be underestimated because part of the flow channelization structure was not captured notably the green marked area and the grey effective flow area did not coincide here we adopt a cut off flow value of 5e 6 m2 s as an example to explain how the correlation length of the aperture field affects the effective flow area as shown in fig 9 when the correlation length ratio is 1 i e case œÜ x y the effective flow area first significantly decreases at the small correlation length scale and then tends to remain stable with increasing correlation length scale this is expected because as the correlation length scale is reduced more open areas appendix a are generated and eventually degenerate into parallel plate models once the correlation length ratio differs from 1 i e case œÜ x y the effective flow area decreases with increasing correlation length ratio in addition the effective flow area in case œÜ x y is closely related to the major range direction for example although the aperture distributions in cases œÜ x y 0 6 2 and œÜ x y 2 0 6 are consistent there is a statistically significant difference in the effective flow area in conclusion the correlation length scale is the main factor affecting the effective flow area when there is no main aperture field range otherwise the major range direction is the main influencing factor 3 3 temperature observables fig 10 shows examples of the simulated temperature distributions on the fracture walls the distribution of the fracture wall temperature is affected by the hydraulic heterogeneity conditions fig 6 the temperature decline in the area where flow channelization occurs fig 6 is very significant it can be observed that the low temperature front moves forward in an irregular manner showing a tailing phenomenon moreover we can observe that some residual high temperature regions rhtrs emerged on the fracture wall due to the low permeability of the contact obstacles the presence of an rhtr suggests that local geothermal energy resources have not been fully extracted which is one of the sources of production uncertainty furthermore the increase in the correlation length reflects two characteristics 1 the low temperature area dark colour on the fracture surface changes from slender and tortuous to wide and smooth 2 the rhtr extent is expanded however these phenomena are not observed in the traditional parallel plate model the results show that if the spatial variability of the voids in individual fractures is ignored the productivity predictions of geothermal reservoirs using the parallel plate model may be unacceptable we calculated the average temperature at the outlet which is referred to as the production temperature t pro all samples are shown in fig 11a note that the parallel plate model with a constant aperture was used as input considering the narrow range of hydraulic apertures inferred from eqs 10 and 11 only the upper limit the black dotted line in fig 11a and lower limit the green dotted line in fig 11a of the simulated production temperature are given here the hydraulic aperture inferred from the cubic law eq 12 exhibits a wide range so the average value was used as a representative simulation value to obtain the production temperature the dark red dashed line in fig 11a in case œÜ x y the standard deviation std of the production temperature increased from 1 567 k to 12 322 k with increasing correlation length moreover the coefficient of variation cv the ratio between the standard deviation and mean increased from 0 0048 and 0 0023 to 0 035 and 0 0235 respectively indicating that the production temperature variability became increasingly significant in case œÜ x y the horizontally distributed contact obstacles prolonged the travel path figs 6 and 7 of the heat transfer fluid and significantly increased the production temperature furthermore the increase in the correlation length ratio also led to an increase in cv from 0 0133 to 0 0739 the production temperature characteristic values of all samples are listed in table 2 the production temperature simulated with a constant aperture attained a negative correlation with the aperture e g chen et al 2018b it could be observed that the simulated production temperature of both the hydraulic aperture inferred from eqs 10 and 11 and the average mechanical aperture was lower than that of the heterogeneous model fig 11b further shows the correlation between the production temperature and the correlation length scale at 200 days it could be observed that the maximum production temperature error between the parallel plate model and the heterogeneous model reached 55 99 the correlation length ratio increased from 0 6 2 to 2 0 6 case œÜ x y is considered here and the corresponding average production temperature increased from 325 k to 425 k showing a positive correlation as a result the degree of underestimation of the average production temperature of the heterogeneous model by the parallel plate model increased from 5 03 to 27 16 once this underestimation exceeds the developer s acceptable tolerance the parallel plate model is no longer suitable for replacing the heterogeneous model moreover in case œÜ x y the production temperature increased with increasing correlation length scale interestingly although the parallel plate model with the hydraulic aperture inferred from the cubic law still underestimated the production temperature it could capture the variable relationship between the production temperature simulated with the heterogeneous model and the correlation length scale therefore a correction coefficient related to the correlation length scale was introduced to compensate for this underestimation and the expression is as follows 14 t pro Œ± t pre where Œ± is the correction coefficient related to the correlation length scale and t pre k is the production temperature predicted with the hydraulic aperture model 3 4 scale dependence of the cumulative heat production the cumulative heat production e pro represents the total heat energy extracted from the fractured reservoir unit by the circulating fluid and can be obtained as follows 15 e pro q pro œÅ w c p w t pro t inj dt where q pro m3 s is the flow rate at the outlet and t s is the time step of the solution fig 12 reports the cumulative heat production of all samples including a parallel plate model with a constant aperture the relationship between the cumulative heat production and the correlation length scale was the opposite to the temperature evolution trend shown in fig 11 because the temperature difference t pro t inj in eq 15 contributed more significantly to the cumulative heat production than the product term of the mass flow rate and the specific heat capacity q pro œÅ w c p w in eq 15 similar to the temperature observation fig 11 the increase in the correlation length scale enhanced the observation uncertainty in the cumulative heat production the parallel plate model with an average mechanical aperture overestimated the cumulative heat production and the overestimation rate based on the mean varied between 10 07 and 79 13 the degree of overestimation increased with increasing correlation length ratio however the parallel plate model with the hydraulic aperture inferred from eqs 10 and 11 could obtain a prediction interval with a lower limit e min of 3 95 1011 j and an upper limit e max of 4 78 1011 j this interval effectively includes cases with small correlation length scales such as œÜ x y 0 2 0 6 and œÜ x y 0 6 1 1 2 0 6 2 in contrast to fig 11 although the hydraulic aperture inferred from the cubic law also captured the evolution trend of the cumulative heat production with the correlation length it significantly underestimated the cumulative heat production similarly a more accurate prediction result can be obtained by using the following equation 16 e pro Œ≤ e pre where Œ≤ is the correction coefficient related to the correlation length scale and e pre j is the cumulative heat production predicted with the hydraulic aperture model we used a logarithmic regression model to fit the relationship between the effective flow area open area a o and cumulative heat production a parallel plate model with an average mechanical aperture of 0 2 mm was considered an extreme scenario of the heterogeneous model the influence of different cut off flow values on the fitting results was also considered the logarithmic regression model used can be defined as follows 17 e pro a b ln a c where a b and c are coefficients and a m2 is the area all fitting results are shown in fig 13 because a low cut off flow contains non dominant flow channels fig 8 the cumulative heat production and effective flow area showed a weak correlation r2 0 5 in contrary a high cut off flow strictly captures channelized flow thus obtaining a fitting effect with a suitable correlation compared to case œÜ x y the fitting effect of case œÜ x y was better probably because the effective surface area is strongly affected by the œÜ x y but much less so by the œÜ x y fig 9 the fitting results in fig 13a reveal the strong correlation between the cumulative heat production and channelized flow and confirm that the preferential flow channels are the main location for heat energy extraction as a result the effective flow area could be used as a tool to estimate the thermal output of fractured reservoir units furthermore although the fluid mainly passes through the voids in the fractures fig 13b shows that there exists no satisfactory correlation between the open area and the cumulative heat production this result shows that the contact obstacles and open voids are not the main factors affecting the difference in heat extraction but the resultant specific channelized flow in other words directly using the measured or inverted aperture distribution to predict thermal energy production may possibly be unreliable finally we examined the dependence of the cumulative heat production on the tortuosity fig 7 the linear fitting results of the 10th 25th 50th median 75th and 90th percentiles of the tortuosity set are shown in fig 14 in addition the mean tortuosity was considered these percentiles represent relatively low 10 and 25 moderate 50 and mean and relatively high 75 and 90 values of the tortuosity the correlation between the tortuosity and correlation length scale is shown in fig 7 fig 14 shows that a general trend is that the cumulative heat energy decreased with increasing tortuosity i e e pro œà 1 except for the 10th and 25th percentiles the r2 value of the other statistics to be assessed exceeded 0 5 the percentile fitting effect characterized by r2 emphasized the applicability of different percentile tortuosity data because streamline length statistics do not provide flow information the fitting effect is worse than that using the effective flow area it should be pointed out that whether the effective flow area or tortuosity is used as the prediction tool the specific engineering parameters related to the geothermal field such as the reservoir temperature injection flow fracture size and operation time should be used for the basic calibration model 4 discussion the numerical simulations visualized the flow field structure and temperature distribution on the fracture surface we defined the effective flow area and tortuosity to quantify the influence of flow channelization on the thermal energy production of fractured reservoir units compared to the parallel plate hypothesis the heterogeneous model with a variable aperture allowed the fluid to choose the dominant interconnected path thus forming a flow field organization with a significant channeled flow fig 6 as anticipated this understanding is generally consistent with previous experimental chen et al 2018a ishibashi et al 2012 and numerical nemoto et al 2009 wang et al 2021 studies furthermore the temperature observations showed the uncertainty due to flow channelization the simulation results revealed a positive correlation between the production temperature in a single fracture and the correlation length scale of the aperture field fig 11 which may provide insight into the use of temperature observations to estimate the anisotropy information of the aperture field however according to the work of guo et al 2016 the production temperature decreases with increasing correlation length the possible reason is that their fracture model did not consider contact obstacles this work demonstrated that the parallel plate model with the measured aperture underestimated and overestimated the production temperature fig 11 and cumulative heat production fig 12 respectively with the heterogeneous model interestingly when the correlation length was small or the flow direction was parallel to the major range direction the simulation results under a constant aperture were close to those of the heterogeneous model hence the parallel plate model may be acceptable when the ratio of the fracture scale to the correlation length exceeds a certain threshold moreover the cumulative heat production of heterogeneous models with a smaller correlation length scale can be predicted with a maximum error of 21 using the inferential models of zimmerman and bodvarsson 1996 and yeo 2001 although both could significantly underestimate the production temperature the production temperature and cumulative heat production of the heterogeneous model were significantly underestimated by the hydraulic aperture model inferred by the cubic law however the fluctuation in the heat extraction performance of the heterogeneous model with the correlation length could be captured by the hydraulic aperture model which illustrates the importance of hydraulic properties e g klepikova et al 2021 we propose to use the correction coefficient related to the correlation length to correct this underestimation therefore the fracture hydraulic properties provided by flow tests laboratory or field should be preferentially used instead of directly using the hypothetical input of the mean mechanical aperture the results also showed that the cumulative heat production could be predicted by a logarithmic relationship fig 13 using the effective flow area reflecting flow channelization similar to this result okoroafor et al 2022 obtained a linear relationship from a centimetre scale fracture model another prediction tool is the tortuosity fig 14 which exhibits a linear negative correlation with the cumulative heat production generally field operators can obtain basic information on reservoir fractures such as the mean variance roughness and contact rate of the aperture through formation micro scanner images fmis or laboratory simulations e g cardona et al 2021 hyman et al 2021 in addition the size and orientation of fractures can be estimated via inversion of microseismic data although the above data are far from sufficient for accurate simulation predictions they can be used as basic model input herein we developed a workflow to illustrate how to use the proposed prediction tool first the mean aperture was used in the fracture model and a parallel plate benchmark model was obtained by incorporating the temperature pressure conditions of geothermal reservoirs second a series of multi scale aperture fields were simulated by using the measured aperture mean variance and arbitrarily set correlation length with the use of these multi scale aperture fields prediction curves based on the effective flow area fig 13 and tortuosity fig 14 could be fitted finally using the fracture active area an approximation of the effective flow area or breakthrough time inverted from the results of tracer tests involving multiple tracers an acceptable prediction could be given by the prediction curve here compared to the tortuosity it is difficult to obtain the effective flow area however a combination of combined injection testing tracer testing electrical resistivity tomography ert testing or time variation flow and temperature based testing may provide a solution for obtaining the effective flow area in a fracture it must be mentioned that there are still some limitations related to this work including neglecting the dependence of the aperture field on the in situ stress and thermal stress in future work the in situ stress will be incorporated into the model focusing on understanding the development of the heat transport process caused by shear dilatancy in addition we will also explore the impact of the mutual configuration of the modeling scale and correlation length on the observation results to solve the problem of productivity prediction of multi scale fractured geothermal reservoirs 5 conclusions in this study we investigated the impact of the aperture heterogeneity on the heat transport behavior in a medium scale fracture unit considering the multi scale characteristics of the correlation length and potential contact obstacles the most important conclusions in this work can be summarized as follows the dispersion degree of production observations of fractured reservoir units depends on the correlation length of the variable aperture the flow channel structure develops from thin and numerous braids to wide and fewer bands with increasing correlation length the correlation length scale is the main factor that affects the channelized flow structure in the case of no major range otherwise the main factor is the main range direction that determines how the contact obstacles cut off the flow field the parallel plate model with the average mechanical aperture and inferred equivalent hydraulic aperture underestimates the production temperature of the heterogeneous aperture model and the underestimation increases with the correlation length scale and ratio however the equivalent hydraulic aperture model inferred from the cubic law captures the variable evolution trend of the observed results obtained with the heterogeneous model therefore the hydraulic aperture model inferred from the flow tests can compensate for the underestimation of the heterogeneous model via a correction coefficient related to the correlation length flow channelization can be quantitatively characterized by the effective flow area and tortuosity both can be used as prediction tools to predict the cumulative heat production of fractured reservoir units through logarithmic and linear models respectively in general both the effective flow area and the tortuosity are negatively correlated with the correlation length scale ratio credit authorship contribution statement xuefeng gao conceptualization investigation formal analysis

2722,imbibition in a strongly wetting square tube with corner flow can be described by an interacting capillary bundle model where the first sub capillary describes the main meniscus flow while the others describe corner film flow in this work an advanced modified interacting capillary bundle model micbm is developed to simulate imbibition dynamics in a strongly wetting square tube incorporating the viscous coupling effect the flow conductances of each sub capillary are obtained from two phase lattice boltzmann simulations with different viscosity ratios considering the viscous coupling effect after verifying its accuracy micbm is used to analyze the imbibition dynamics of main meniscus and corner film flows under different conditions the results show that with increasing viscosity ratio between wetting and non wetting fluids and increasing driving force the wetting corner film development tends to be less significant compared with main meniscus flow interestingly the corner film length first increases then decreases when the wetting fluid is less viscous than the non wetting fluid in a long square tube a phase diagram of dimensionless corner film length versus driving force and viscosity ratio is proposed to characterize the competition between main meniscus and corner film flow gravity and smaller contact angle make the corner film development more obvious in addition the tube length and width are shown to influence the interaction between main meniscus and corner film flow for a low viscosity ratio the underlying physics of the above phenomena are explained in detail keywords imbibition corner film viscous coupling interacting capillary bundle model phase diagram data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction multiphase flow in porous media is very common in many scientific and engineering processes such as oil and gas field development m blunt 2017 jia et al 2021 yang et al 2015 j zhao et al 2018 geological co2 storage boot handford et al 2014 liu et al 2020 yang et al 2020 liquid gas transport in polymer exchange membrane fuel cells chen et al 2022 mukherjee et al 2011 etc for an angular pore when the wetting phase contact angle is smaller than a critical value a wetting film can develop in its corners zhao et al 2021 such corner film flow may significantly influence multiphase transport in porous media the thickening of a wetting corner film can result in snap off a phenomenon where the wetting fluid fills a smaller pore between bigger pores hence blocking the transport of the non wetting fluid snap off is beneficial for co2 storage but should be avoided for oil recovery during drying of porous media corner film can transport liquid from bottom bulk regions to the top drying front which significantly promotes the drying rate chauvet et al 2009 lal et al 2019 prat 2007 however corner film dynamics and its interaction with main meniscus flow is yet to be well understood there are different methods to describe and analyze corner film flow micro scale experiments are a straightforward way to observe and study fluid flow processes in porous materials lenormand and zarcone 1984 conducted liquid imbibition experiments in 2 dimensional capillary networks and analyzed the influence of flow rate on fluid configuration three imbibition mechanisms including piston like displacement corner film flow and thin film flow by surface roughness were proposed to play different roles under different flow rates dong and chatzis 2010 implemented liquid imbibition in a periodically constricted capillary tube and found that the wetting corner film develops faster when the main meniscus is within a pore than within a throat indicating the significant influence of capillary pressure of the main meniscus on corner film development zhao et al 2016 analyzed displacement patterns under different capillary numbers and wettability the corner film flow which happened under strongly wetting conditions was found to have a significant influence on the displacement front tsao et al 2021 analyzed the influence of capillary number and pore structure on the non wetting phase trapping during imbibition in 2 5d porous media an interacting capillary bundle model was successfully used to explain the competition between main meniscus and corner film flow wijnhorst et al 2020 studied liquid imbibition in a square tube with corner film flow and analyzed the influence of a surfactant on the imbibition dynamics microscale experimental method is usually expensive and time consuming in addition the detailed flow information such as pressure and velocity distributions is difficult to obtain pore scale numerical simulation is a complementary method to microscale experiment chen et al 2022 son et al 2016 simulated imbibition in different polygonal tubes using a pseudopotential lattice boltzmann model and the corner film flow was successfully simulated gurumurthy et al 2018 used the volume of fluid method with adaptive mesh refinement to simulate liquid imbibition in a square tube a scaling analysis was proposed to describe the corner film development under different conditions zhao et al 2021 used a color gradient lattice boltzmann model to simulate and analyze liquid imbibition dynamics in a strongly wetting square tube under different fluid properties hu et al 2018 studied the competing effects of wettability and flow rate on the displacement pattern using openfoam simulations the corner film showed significant influence only for small capillary numbers and strong wetting conditions comparing the performances of different pore scale numerical methods zhao et al 2019 pointed out that due to the significant scale difference between main meniscus and corner film it is quite computationally expensive to simulate corner film flow together with main meniscus flow in porous media using direct numerical methods as an alternative pore network models pnms simplify the complex porous structures into regular pore networks consisting of throat bonds and pore nodes and use darcy type equations to describe multiphase flow processes gong et al 2021 gong and piri 2020 gostick et al 2016 jianlin zhao et al 2020 as the main multiphase interaction mechanisms are considered in the pore network model it has been widely used to study multiphase flow characteristics in porous media m j blunt et al 2013 song et al 2018 multiphase pnms can be divided into two types quasi static pnm which considers only capillary force is restricted to very low flow rate conditions valvatne and blunt 2004 zhao et al 2020 and dynamic pnm dpnm which considers both capillary and viscous forces an et al 2020 joekar niasar and hassanizadeh 2012 dpnm has been extensively used to simulate imbibition in porous media under strongly wetting conditions corner film flow should be considered nguyen et al 2006 proposed a dpnm simulating imbibition in porous media in which corner film flow its thickening as well as snap off were considered the competition between snap off and frontal displacement showed a significant influence on phase distribution and relative permeability t√∏r√• et al 2011 incorporated dynamic wetting corner film and corner film thickening induced snap off mechanisms into the single pressure dpnm to simulate imbibition in a realistic sand pack pore network qin et al 2021 proposed a dpnm considering the competition between main meniscus and corner film filling mechanisms to analyze spontaneous imbibition in a porous medium which was validated with direct numerical simulation however all above mentioned dynamic pore network models assumed a pre existing corner film therefore the dynamic development of corner film was not considered in addition the viscous coupling effect which significantly influences the conductance of corner film flow was also not considered the accuracy of a pore network model strongly depends on the appropriateness of the implemented filling mechanisms in each throat bond and pore node therefore an important step is to accurately describe the imbibition dynamics in a single tube liquid imbibition in a gas filled circular tube can be well described by the washburn equation cai et al 2022 li et al 2019 meng et al 2017 washburn 1921 to describe main meniscus flow compounded with corner film flow different mathematical models were developed m dong and chatzis 1995 tang and tang 1994 weislogel 2012 yu et al 2018 the scaling law between imbibition length and time was widely analyzed most of these models involve complex mathematical derivations and may not be practical in applications recently we modified the interacting capillary bundle model to describe liquid imbibition dynamics considering corner film flow which showed good agreement with reference lattice boltzmann simulation results jianlin zhao et al 2021 however all the above mathematical models are developed for a liquid gas system omitting the viscous coupling effect at the two phase interface which significantly influences the interactions between main meniscus and corner film flow therefore this paper presents the development of an advanced interacting capillary bundle model incorporating the viscous coupling effect in order to describe imbibition in a strongly wetting square tube the new capacities of the model lead to contributions in the systematic analysis of the competition mechanism between main meniscus and corner film flow in a strongly wetting square tube and in a phase diagram characterizing the significance of corner film flow this paper is organized as following in section 2 we analyze the viscous coupling effect on corner film flow and develop an advanced interacting capillary bundle model incorporating the viscous coupling effect which is validated in section 3 in section 4 we analyze the influence of some parameters on the imbibition dynamics in a strongly wetting square tube with an emphasis on the competition between main meniscus and corner film flow finally the conclusions are summarized in section 5 2 numerical methods in this work we develop an advanced interacting capillary bundle model to describe the interactions between main meniscus and corner film flow considering the viscous coupling effect the lattice boltzmann method is firstly used to simulate corner film flow under different viscosity ratios and saturations these simulation results allow to determine conductances used in the interacting capillary bundle model the numerical models are briefly introduced below 2 1 viscous coupling effect of two phase flow through a square tube when two immiscible fluids coexist in the same pore the movement of one fluid will cause flow of the other fluid due to the viscous drag force at their interface which is known as viscous coupling effect huang and lu 2009 j zhao et al 2018 the generalized two phase darcy s law can be used to describe two phase flow in porous media considering the viscous coupling effect h li et al 2005 1 q w g sp g r ww Œº w g w g sp g r wn Œº n g n q n g sp g r nw Œº w g w g sp g r nn Œº n g n where subscripts w and n refer to wetting and non wetting phase q i is the flow rate of phase i g sp is the single phase or saturated flow conductance g r ij is the relative conductance Œº i is the dynamic viscosity g i Œ¥ p i l œÅ i a i is the external force term where Œ¥p l œÅ and a are the pressure difference tube length density and external acceleration respectively in this work we focus on imbibition dynamics in a single square tube the color gradient lattice boltzmann method jianlin zhao et al 2021 jianlin zhao et al 2020 is used to calculate the relative conductance for different saturations and viscosity ratios to save computational resources we simulate corner film flow across one quarter of the square tube with a domain size 400 400 as shown in fig 1 a fig 1 b shows the simulation domain with 2 lattices in x direction we add external body forces on both fluids and adopt periodic boundary conditions in x direction when the simulations reach steady state the volume flow rate of each phase across the tube is calculated to get the four relative conductance mentioned in eq 1 two sets of simulations are required for a certain saturation in the first set of simulations we apply an external force only on the wetting phase in the corner fig 1 c e and g show the steady state dimensionless velocity distributions when the viscosity ratio m Œº w Œº n between wetting and non wetting fluids is 0 01 1 0 and 100 0 respectively as can be seen due to the viscous coupling effect the velocities of non wetting phase are not 0 even though the exerted force is 0 in the second set of simulations we apply the same external force accelerations on both fluids and the steady state dimensionless velocity distributions are shown in fig 1 d f and h for different m with the two sets of simulations for a certain saturation and viscosity ratio the four relative conductances can be calculated fig 2 a d show the relationships between relative conductance and wetting phase saturation for different viscosity ratios when the wetting phase contact angle is 21 9 as can be seen the viscous ratio has a significant influence on the relative conductance due to the viscous coupling effect the less viscous fluid has a lubrication effect on the more viscous fluid therefore g r ww increases and g r nn decreases as m increases in addition g r ww increases with s w mainly because the wetting fluid occupies more pore space as s w increases the off diagonal relative conductances g r wn and g r nw also increase with s w the reason is that the interfacial area increases with s w which increases the viscous coupling effect the two off diagonal relative conductances are related to each other and g r wn g r nw Œº n Œº w as shown in fig 2 e for the ranges of s w and m considered in this work fig 2 d shows that g r nn decreases with s w when m is higher than 1 0 because the non wetting fluid occupies less pore space as s w increases oppositely g r nn increases with s w when m is smaller than 1 0 due to the more significant lubrication effect caused by the larger interfacial area under higher s w 2 2 interacting capillary bundle model considering viscous coupling effect the interacting capillary bundle model uses interacting sub capillaries to characterize the angular tube where the first sub capillary characterizes the main meniscus flow and the other sub capillaries represent the corner film flow based on the force balance between capillary viscous gravitational and external forces in terms of pressure difference in each sub capillary the following equations can be derived mingzhe dong et al 2005 jianlin zhao et al 2021 2 h k 1 t h k t i k 1 n q i t i k 1 n Œª w i h k 1 t h k t i 1 k q i t

et al 2021 the accuracy of the interacting capillary bundle model strongly depends on the determination of capillary pressure and viscous force in each sub capillary in previous work jianlin zhao et al 2021 we propose a strategy to decompose the square tube into interacting sub capillaries without shape simplification however this previous work ignores the viscous coupling effect when calculating the conductance of liquid corner flow and only applies to the liquid gas system in this work we use the same decomposition process and calculate the conductance of each sub capillary based on the method introduced in section 2 1 to incorporate the viscous coupling effect to keep the simple format of the interacting capillary bundle model we retain the following extended two phase darcy s law to describe two phase flow 5 q w g sp g r w Œº w g w q n g sp g r n Œº n g n where g r w and g r n are the relative conductance in the extended two phase darcy s law comparing eq 5 with eq 1 we get

s w k Œº w i 1 k 1 Œª n i g sp g r n s n k 1 Œº n the external force terms g w and g n depend on the flow rate which is approximated by the value in the previous simulation step which is sufficient accurate due to the quite small time step used in this work through eqs 6 and 7 the viscous coupling effect is introduced into the interacting capillary bundle model which we name the modified interacting capillary bundle model micbm in the following analysis note that for every viscosity ratio the four relative conductance curves versus saturation are determined by interpolation of the existing lbm simulation results 3 model validation to validate the accuracy of micbm we simulate spontaneous imbibition in a strongly wetting square tube for different viscosity ratios and compare the simulation results with high resolution two phase lattice boltzmann simulation results together with the prediction results of icbm developed in our previous work jianlin zhao et al 2021 which neglects the viscous coupling effect the tube counts 100 lattices in width determined after having performed a grid independence test and due to symmetry reasons only one quarter of the tube is simulated the details of the simulation setup can be found in our previous work jianlin zhao et al 2021 initially the tube is saturated with non wetting fluid and a small amount of wetting fluid is placed at the bottom which is the inlet side pressure boundary conditions are used for both the inlet bottom and outlet top boundaries and we set p in p out the wetting fluid moves from inlet to outlet under the capillary force the fluid and tube properties are listed in table 1 where validation means the properties used in this validation case while analysis represents the properties used in the parametric analysis in section 4 as illustrated in our previous work jianlin zhao et al 2021 the lbm simulation generates a continuous interface profile while the interacting capillary bundle model provides a discrete one we compare the imbibition height of wetting corner film for different methods where the film attains a thickness of 24 75 Œºm therefore in both micbm and icbm the thickness of the smallest sub capillary is 24 75 Œºm it should be noted that the number of sub capillaries also influences the accuracy of the prediction result of the interacting capillary bundle model which should be larger than 5 jianlin zhao et al 2021 and is insensitive to the viscosity ratio in this work the square tube is decomposed into 7 sub capillaries for both micbm and icbm fig 3 compares the imbibition dynamics of main meniscus flow of the center and corner film flow for different viscosity ratios considering gravity as can be seen the prediction results of micbm shown in green in general match well with the reference lbm simulation results shown in black demonstrating the accuracy of micbm in describing the imbibition dynamics under different viscosity ratios while the icbm shown in red which was developed for the liquid gas system neglecting viscous coupling effect is inadequate in describing the interaction between main meniscus and corner film flow in addition for one setup it takes thousands of cpu hours for the lbm simulation while it only takes 0 1 cpu hour for the micbm simulation 4 results and analysis after validating micbm we analyze the influence of different parameters on the imbibition dynamics in a strongly wetting square tube with a special focus on the competition between main meniscus and corner film flow 4 1 influence of viscosity ratio on imbibition dynamics two phase flow in porous media is determined by the interaction between viscous and capillary forces lenormand et al 1988 proposed a phase diagram based on this interaction indicating that the invading non wetting phase may show different displacement patterns for different viscosity ratios and capillary numbers during the drainage process motivated by the work of lenormand et al 1988 we firstly analyze the influence of viscosity ratio on the imbibition dynamics of both the main meniscus and the corner film in a square tube table 1 shows the properties of the square tube and fluids used the viscosity ratio is changed by varying the viscosity of the wetting fluid the square tube is decomposed into 7 sub capillaries and the thickness of the smallest sub capillary is 10 Œºm which is the 7th sub capillary and used to describe the corner film length initially the square tube is saturated with non wetting fluid and only 0 5 of the tube at the bottom is filled with wetting fluid we use pressure boundary conditions at the bottom p in and top p out of the square tube which are the inlet and outlet boundaries respectively firstly we set the same pressure at the bottom and top p in p out and simulate spontaneous imbibition of wetting fluid into the tube fig 4 b compares the imbibition dynamics of main meniscus for different viscosity ratios with increasing viscosity ratio or increasing of Œº w as we fix Œº n the imbibition becomes slower for m 1 0 the main meniscus imbibes linearly with time for m 1 0 the imbibition velocity of the main meniscus decreases with time for m 1 0 the imbibition velocity of the main meniscus increases with time to explain this different behavior we use a conceptual interacting capillary bundle model shown in fig 4 a consisting of 2 interacting sub capillaries the 1st sub capillary represents the main meniscus flow while the 2nd one characterizes the corner film flow we note that this conceptual model is only used for mechanism analysis while all the results in fig 4 are obtained with 7 sub capillaries as the wetting corner film is very thin compared with main meniscus it can be assumed that the development of corner film has little influence on the main meniscus flow therefore the imbibition velocity of main meniscus v 1 and corner film v 2 can be approximated by 8 v 1 g 1 p c 1 p in p out a 1 Œº w h 1 Œº n h h 1 9 v 2 g 2 Œº w a 2 p c 2 p c 1 h 2 h 1 g 2 a 1 Œº n g 1 a 2 Œº w v 1 where g i and p ci are the conductance and capillary pressure of the i th sub capillary h i is the imbibition length or height of i th sub capillary when m 1 0 the denominator of eq 8 is a constant Œº w h resulting in a constant velocity v 1 as shown by the black curve in fig 4 e and h the imbibition velocity of the corner film is initially fast due to the first term in eq 9 caused by a very small corner film length l c h 2 h 1 then it converges to the same velocity as for the main meniscus as shown by the red curve in fig 4 h accordingly we get a stable corner film length l c as shown by the dashed blue line in fig 4 e defined as the difference of imbibition length between main meniscus and corner film l c h 2 h 1 when m 1 0 Œº w Œº n the imbibition velocity of main meniscus can be approximated by v 1 g 1 p c 1 p in p out a 1 Œº w h 1 at initial state h 1 is small which results in a high imbibition velocity of main meniscus with time going h 1 increases and the imbibition velocity of the main meniscus decreases as shown by the black curves in fig 4 d and g while the imbibition dynamics of corner film follows the trend of main meniscus and the corner film length gradually increases with time as shown in fig 4 d and g we find a quasi equilibrium state between main meniscus and corner film flow thus observing that h 2 h 1 v 2 v 1 constant as shown in fig 4 c when m 1 0 the imbibition velocity of main meniscus can be approximated by v 1 g 1 p c 1 p in p out a 1 Œº n h h 1 at initial state h 1 is small which results in a low imbibition velocity of main meniscus as time goes on h 1 increases and the imbibition velocity of the main meniscus increases as shown by the black curve in fig 4 f and i while for the corner film at initial state the corner film length h 2 h 1 is small and first term in eq 9 dominates the imbibition process which results in a high imbibition velocity with increasing corner film length the imbibition velocity of the corner film caused by the first term decreases while the second term becomes increasingly important it is interesting to note that after a certain time the imbibition velocity of corner film is slower than that of the main meniscus which results in a maximum corner film length as shown by the dashed blue curve in fig 4 f whereafter the corner film length decreases with time 4 2 the influence of driving force on imbibition dynamics in this part we study the controlled imbibition process as an external force difference p in p out is applied both the external force and capillary force are driving forces we define a dimensionless driving force p d p c where p d is the driving force and p c is the capillary force of main meniscus p d is calculated as p d p c p in p out by changing the external force term p in p out the dimensionless driving force can be controlled in this section we set the viscosity ratio m 0 125 and all the other parameters are listed in table 1 the initial condition is the same as in the work done in section 4 1 fig 5 shows the imbibition dynamics and velocity of main meniscus and corner film for different dimensionless driving forces as can be seen the imbibition process becomes faster with increasing driving force in addition the development of corner film becomes less significant for a high driving force this can be explained as following the external force has an important influence on the main meniscus flow as shown by eq 8 in previous section with increasing external force the imbibition velocity of the main meniscus becomes faster while the imbibition velocity of the corner film is less sensitive to the external force as the coefficient in second term of eq 9 is usually smaller than 1 therefore for a high dimensionless driving force the imbibition velocity of main meniscus reaches that of corner film at early time as shown in fig 5 d f resulting in a short corner film length it is also interesting to note that for dimensional driving forces equal to 1 0 and 8 0 the imbibition velocity of the corner film first decreases and then after increases as shown in fig 5 e and f the first decreasing stage is caused by an increasing corner film length i e the first term in eq 9 while the second increasing stage is induced by the pushing of the corner film by the main meniscus flowing at high velocity i e the second term in eq 9 4 3 phase diagram characterizing the competition between main meniscus and corner film flow inspired by lenormand s phase diagram lenormand et al 1988 we characterize the competition between main meniscus and corner film flow using the viscosity ratio m and dimensionless driving force p d p c we simulate the imbibition dynamics for different m ranging from 1 64 to 64 and p d p c ranging from 1 256 to 256 fig 6 shows the results of 221 simulations l c is the wetting corner film length at final state when the corner film reaches the outlet and h is the length of the square tube the dimensionless corner film length l c h at final state indicates whether the wetting corner film is prominent the larger l c h the more significant the wetting corner film height fig 6 a and b show the phase diagram in 2d and 3d of the dimensionless corner film length versus driving force and viscosity ratio illustrating the competition between main meniscus and corner film flow fig 6 c and d show the dimensionless corner film length versus driving force and viscosity ratio respectively as can be seen in general the wetting corner film becomes more significant compared with main meniscus with increasing driving force and viscosity ratio the reasons have been analyzed in the previous two sections and we briefly summarize them here the driving force has a more significant influence on the main meniscus flow with increasing dimensionless driving force the imbibition velocity of the main meniscus increases dramatically while that of corner film is less affected accordingly the wetting corner film becomes more prominent with a smaller viscosity ratio which means a lower Œº w the first term in eq 9 becomes larger and dominates the imbibition velocity of corner film resulting in a more significant wetting corner film this phase diagram shows some important implications for porous media applications for example during geological co2 storage it is desired that more co2 to be trapped in sub surface porous media with more significant wetting corner films snap off is more frequent which is beneficial for co2 storage and can be controlled by the injection rates 4 4 influence of gravity on imbibition dynamics when gravity is considered there is an equilibrium height in each sub capillary which is determined by the balance between capillary gravitational and external forces the main meniscus has the lowest equilibrium height due to the smallest capillary force as the imbibition height of main meniscus cannot exceed the equilibrium height the corner film flow becomes more significant as shown in fig 7 a in this figure the red surface illustrates the case with gravity which is located above the blue one without gravity as we use a long square tube in this analysis the dimensionless corner film length at final state is mainly determined by the equilibrium height of the main meniscus therefore the viscosity ratio has less influence on the competition between main meniscus and corner film flow and the dimensionless corner film length strongly depends on the external force as illustrated in fig 7 b in summary gravity counteracts the imbibition process and has a more significant influence on the main meniscus flow compared to corner film making the corner film development more significant 4 5 influence of contact angle on imbibition dynamics different wetting film morphologies will be formed for different contact angles resulting in different capillary pressure and wetting film conductance therefore both the capillary pressure and mobility parameter in eq 2 need to be modified for different contact angles the capillary pressure can be obtained by geometry analysis while the mobility parameter is recalculated through lbm simulations fig 8 below shows the influence of contact angle on the competition between the main meniscus and corner film flow as can be seen with decreasing wetting phase contact angle the dimensionless corner film length increases meaning a more obvious wetting corner film flow the reason is that with decreasing wetting phase contact angle the driving capillary pressure difference Œ¥p c increases and the cross section areas of the sub capillaries in the corners increase increasing the conductances of sub capillaries in corners accordingly the development of corner film is enhanced 4 6 influence of tube length on imbibition dynamics as analyzed in sections 4 1 and 4 2 the longest corner film length during the imbibition process occurs for log m 0 0 or m 1 0 when the tube is not long enough it is possible that the wetting corner film reaches the outlet before reaching its longest corner film length in this section we analyze the influence of tube length on the imbibition dynamics the fluid and tube properties are listed in table 1 with a tube length ranging from 0 2 cm to 25 cm fig 9 compares the phase diagrams of dimensionless corner film length versus driving force and viscosity ratio illustrating the competition between main meniscus and corner film flow for different tube lengths as can be seen when log m is larger than 0 5 the tube length has relatively little influence on the development of wetting corner film the reason is that the corner film flow quickly reaches a quasi equilibrium state with the main meniscus flow for m around or larger than 1 0 as also illustrated in fig 4 d e g and h however when m 1 0 the corner film length increases much faster than the main meniscus does and as a consequence the influence of tube length on the development of corner film becomes more important we further analyze the imbibition dynamics of main meniscus and corner film flow for different tube lengths when p d p c 1 0 and m 0 015625 which corresponds to the point with a star in fig 9 with increasing tube length the total flow resistance inside the tube increases which results in a lower imbibition velocity therefore the time required for the wetting fluid to reach the outlet boundary is not propotional to the tube length as shown in fig 10 when the tube is short the corner film cannot reach its longest value it reaches the outlet boundary before then as illustrated in fig 10 a and b in contrast in fig 10 c and d the corner film length firstly increases to a maximum value and then decreases due to the increasing velocity of main meniscus flow as a consequence the dimensionless corner film length at final state decreases with increasing tube length however we note that with the further increase of tube length the phase diagram almost has no change any more we also note that increasing the tube radius r has the same influence on the competition between main meniscus and corner film flow as decreasing the tube length h it is the ratio between tube length and radius h r that determines the phase diagram more details can be found in the supplementary material 5 conclusion viscous coupling has a significant influence on two phase flow in porous media using two phase lattice boltzmann simulations we determine the conductance of two phase flow through a square tube including the viscous coupling effect and the occurrence of corner flow the results show that the less viscous fluid promotes the mobility of the more viscous fluid due to lubrication effect the obtained conductances for different viscosity ratios and saturation levels including viscous coupling are incorporated into a novel modified interacting capillary bundle model micbm to simulate imbibition in a strongly wetting square tube the accuracy of the new model is validated by comparison with high resolution two phase lattice boltzmann simulation results then this novel micbm is used to analyze the competition between main meniscus and corner film flow during imbibition in a strongly wetting square tube the viscosity ratio m between wetting and non wetting fluids shows a significant influence on the imbibition dynamics for m 1 0 we get a constant imbibition velocity of main meniscus and the corner film length defined as the distance between corner film tip and main meniscus increases to a constant value for m 1 0 the ratio of imbibition velocity between main meniscus and corner film remains constant the imbibition length of corner film is proportional to that of main meniscus and the corner film length increases with time for m 1 0 the imbibition velocity of main meniscus increases with time while that of corner film decreases the corner film length first increases reaching a maximum and then decreases the external driving force affects the imbibition dynamics with increasing external driving force the corner film development becomes less obvious inspired by lenormand s phase diagram lenormand et al 1988 we propose a phase diagram of the corner film length versus viscosity ratio and driving force characterizing the competition between main meniscus and corner film flow in general with decreasing viscosity ratio and dimensionless driving force corner film development becomes more significant as gravity acts as a force resisting the imbibition process it has a more significant influence on the main meniscus flow and as a result corner film development becomes more obvious in addition as expected the corner film becomes more significant with the decrease of contact angle finally the influence of tube length on the competition between main meniscus and corner film flow is analyzed the results show that the tube length has relatively little influence on the development of wetting corner film when m is around 1 0 or larger than 1 0 however when m 1 0 the corner film development becomes less significant with increasing tube length currently this novel micbm only applies to the imbibition process in a single square tube in future research it will be combined with a dynamic pore network model to simulate and analyze imbibition processes in more complex and realistic porous geometries difficulties lie in 1 the extension of the micbm to other angular tubes 2 the connection between different micbms in the complex pore networks and 3 the treatment of some specific multiphase phenomena like snapping off capillary trapping etc in addition it could be further applied to study the drying process explicitly

2722,imbibition in a strongly wetting square tube with corner flow can be described by an interacting capillary bundle model where the first sub capillary describes the main meniscus flow while the others describe corner film flow in this work an advanced modified interacting capillary bundle model micbm is developed to simulate imbibition dynamics in a strongly wetting square tube incorporating the viscous coupling effect the flow conductances of each sub capillary are obtained from two phase lattice boltzmann simulations with different viscosity ratios considering the viscous coupling effect after verifying its accuracy micbm is used to analyze the imbibition dynamics of main meniscus and corner film flows under different conditions the results show that with increasing viscosity ratio between wetting and non wetting fluids and increasing driving force the wetting corner film development tends to be less significant compared with main meniscus flow interestingly the corner film length first increases then decreases when the wetting fluid is less viscous than the non wetting fluid in a long square tube a phase diagram of dimensionless corner film length versus driving force and viscosity ratio is proposed to characterize the competition between main meniscus and corner film flow gravity and smaller contact angle make the corner film development more obvious in addition the tube length and width are shown to influence the interaction between main meniscus and corner film flow for a low viscosity ratio the underlying physics of the above phenomena are explained in detail keywords imbibition corner film viscous coupling interacting capillary bundle model phase diagram data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction multiphase flow in porous media is very common in many scientific and engineering processes such as oil and gas field development m blunt 2017 jia et al 2021 yang et al 2015 j zhao et al 2018 geological co2 storage boot handford et al 2014 liu et al 2020 yang et al 2020 liquid gas transport in polymer exchange membrane fuel cells chen et al 2022 mukherjee et al 2011 etc for an angular pore when the wetting phase contact angle is smaller than a critical value a wetting film can develop in its corners zhao et al 2021 such corner film flow may significantly influence multiphase transport in porous media the thickening of a wetting corner film can result in snap off a phenomenon where the wetting fluid fills a smaller pore between bigger pores hence blocking the transport of the non wetting fluid snap off is beneficial for co2 storage but should be avoided for oil recovery during drying of porous media corner film can transport liquid from bottom bulk regions to the top drying front which significantly promotes the drying rate chauvet et al 2009 lal et al 2019 prat 2007 however corner film dynamics and its interaction with main meniscus flow is yet to be well understood there are different methods to describe and analyze corner film flow micro scale experiments are a straightforward way to observe and study fluid flow processes in porous materials lenormand and zarcone 1984 conducted liquid imbibition experiments in 2 dimensional capillary networks and analyzed the influence of flow rate on fluid configuration three imbibition mechanisms including piston like displacement corner film flow and thin film flow by surface roughness were proposed to play different roles under different flow rates dong and chatzis 2010 implemented liquid imbibition in a periodically constricted capillary tube and found that the wetting corner film develops faster when the main meniscus is within a pore than within a throat indicating the significant influence of capillary pressure of the main meniscus on corner film development zhao et al 2016 analyzed displacement patterns under different capillary numbers and wettability the corner film flow which happened under strongly wetting conditions was found to have a significant influence on the displacement front tsao et al 2021 analyzed the influence of capillary number and pore structure on the non wetting phase trapping during imbibition in 2 5d porous media an interacting capillary bundle model was successfully used to explain the competition between main meniscus and corner film flow wijnhorst et al 2020 studied liquid imbibition in a square tube with corner film flow and analyzed the influence of a surfactant on the imbibition dynamics microscale experimental method is usually expensive and time consuming in addition the detailed flow information such as pressure and velocity distributions is difficult to obtain pore scale numerical simulation is a complementary method to microscale experiment chen et al 2022 son et al 2016 simulated imbibition in different polygonal tubes using a pseudopotential lattice boltzmann model and the corner film flow was successfully simulated gurumurthy et al 2018 used the volume of fluid method with adaptive mesh refinement to simulate liquid imbibition in a square tube a scaling analysis was proposed to describe the corner film development under different conditions zhao et al 2021 used a color gradient lattice boltzmann model to simulate and analyze liquid imbibition dynamics in a strongly wetting square tube under different fluid properties hu et al 2018 studied the competing effects of wettability and flow rate on the displacement pattern using openfoam simulations the corner film showed significant influence only for small capillary numbers and strong wetting conditions comparing the performances of different pore scale numerical methods zhao et al 2019 pointed out that due to the significant scale difference between main meniscus and corner film it is quite computationally expensive to simulate corner film flow together with main meniscus flow in porous media using direct numerical methods as an alternative pore network models pnms simplify the complex porous structures into regular pore networks consisting of throat bonds and pore nodes and use darcy type equations to describe multiphase flow processes gong et al 2021 gong and piri 2020 gostick et al 2016 jianlin zhao et al 2020 as the main multiphase interaction mechanisms are considered in the pore network model it has been widely used to study multiphase flow characteristics in porous media m j blunt et al 2013 song et al 2018 multiphase pnms can be divided into two types quasi static pnm which considers only capillary force is restricted to very low flow rate conditions valvatne and blunt 2004 zhao et al 2020 and dynamic pnm dpnm which considers both capillary and viscous forces an et al 2020 joekar niasar and hassanizadeh 2012 dpnm has been extensively used to simulate imbibition in porous media under strongly wetting conditions corner film flow should be considered nguyen et al 2006 proposed a dpnm simulating imbibition in porous media in which corner film flow its thickening as well as snap off were considered the competition between snap off and frontal displacement showed a significant influence on phase distribution and relative permeability t√∏r√• et al 2011 incorporated dynamic wetting corner film and corner film thickening induced snap off mechanisms into the single pressure dpnm to simulate imbibition in a realistic sand pack pore network qin et al 2021 proposed a dpnm considering the competition between main meniscus and corner film filling mechanisms to analyze spontaneous imbibition in a porous medium which was validated with direct numerical simulation however all above mentioned dynamic pore network models assumed a pre existing corner film therefore the dynamic development of corner film was not considered in addition the viscous coupling effect which significantly influences the conductance of corner film flow was also not considered the accuracy of a pore network model strongly depends on the appropriateness of the implemented filling mechanisms in each throat bond and pore node therefore an important step is to accurately describe the imbibition dynamics in a single tube liquid imbibition in a gas filled circular tube can be well described by the washburn equation cai et al 2022 li et al 2019 meng et al 2017 washburn 1921 to describe main meniscus flow compounded with corner film flow different mathematical models were developed m dong and chatzis 1995 tang and tang 1994 weislogel 2012 yu et al 2018 the scaling law between imbibition length and time was widely analyzed most of these models involve complex mathematical derivations and may not be practical in applications recently we modified the interacting capillary bundle model to describe liquid imbibition dynamics considering corner film flow which showed good agreement with reference lattice boltzmann simulation results jianlin zhao et al 2021 however all the above mathematical models are developed for a liquid gas system omitting the viscous coupling effect at the two phase interface which significantly influences the interactions between main meniscus and corner film flow therefore this paper presents the development of an advanced interacting capillary bundle model incorporating the viscous coupling effect in order to describe imbibition in a strongly wetting square tube the new capacities of the model lead to contributions in the systematic analysis of the competition mechanism between main meniscus and corner film flow in a strongly wetting square tube and in a phase diagram characterizing the significance of corner film flow this paper is organized as following in section 2 we analyze the viscous coupling effect on corner film flow and develop an advanced interacting capillary bundle model incorporating the viscous coupling effect which is validated in section 3 in section 4 we analyze the influence of some parameters on the imbibition dynamics in a strongly wetting square tube with an emphasis on the competition between main meniscus and corner film flow finally the conclusions are summarized in section 5 2 numerical methods in this work we develop an advanced interacting capillary bundle model to describe the interactions between main meniscus and corner film flow considering the viscous coupling effect the lattice boltzmann method is firstly used to simulate corner film flow under different viscosity ratios and saturations these simulation results allow to determine conductances used in the interacting capillary bundle model the numerical models are briefly introduced below 2 1 viscous coupling effect of two phase flow through a square tube when two immiscible fluids coexist in the same pore the movement of one fluid will cause flow of the other fluid due to the viscous drag force at their interface which is known as viscous coupling effect huang and lu 2009 j zhao et al 2018 the generalized two phase darcy s law can be used to describe two phase flow in porous media considering the viscous coupling effect h li et al 2005 1 q w g sp g r ww Œº w g w g sp g r wn Œº n g n q n g

the relative conductance Œº i is the dynamic viscosity g i Œ¥ p i l œÅ i a i is the external force term where Œ¥p l œÅ and a are the pressure difference tube length density and external acceleration respectively in this work we focus on imbibition dynamics in a single square tube the color gradient lattice boltzmann method jianlin zhao et al 2021 jianlin zhao et al 2020 is used to calculate the relative conductance for different saturations and viscosity ratios to save computational resources we simulate corner film flow across one quarter of the square tube with a domain size 400 400 as shown in fig 1 a fig 1 b shows the simulation domain with 2 lattices in x direction we add external body forces on both fluids and adopt periodic boundary conditions in x direction when the simulations reach steady state the volume flow rate of each phase across the tube is calculated to get the four relative conductance mentioned in eq 1 two sets of simulations are required for a certain saturation in the first set of simulations we apply an external force only on the wetting phase in the corner fig 1 c e and g show the steady state dimensionless velocity distributions when the viscosity ratio m Œº w Œº n between wetting and non wetting fluids is 0 01 1 0 and 100 0 respectively as can be seen due to the viscous coupling effect the velocities of non wetting phase are not 0 even though the exerted force is 0 in the second set of simulations we apply the same external force accelerations on both fluids and the steady state dimensionless velocity distributions are shown in fig 1 d f and h for different m with the two sets of simulations for a certain saturation and viscosity ratio the four relative conductances can be calculated fig 2 a d show the relationships between relative conductance and wetting phase saturation for different viscosity ratios when the wetting phase contact angle is 21 9 as can be seen the viscous ratio has a significant influence on the relative conductance due to the viscous coupling effect the less viscous fluid has a lubrication effect on the more viscous fluid therefore g r ww increases and g r nn decreases as m increases in addition g r ww increases with s w mainly because the wetting fluid occupies more pore space as s w increases the off diagonal relative conductances g r wn and g r nw also increase with s w the reason is that the interfacial area increases with s w which increases the viscous coupling effect the two off diagonal relative conductances are related to each other and g r wn g r nw Œº n Œº w as shown in fig 2 e for the ranges of s w and m considered in this work fig 2 d shows that g r nn decreases with s w when m is higher than 1 0 because the non wetting fluid occupies less pore space as s w increases oppositely g r nn increases with s w when m is smaller than 1 0 due to the more significant lubrication effect caused by the larger interfacial area under higher s w 2 2 interacting capillary bundle model considering viscous coupling effect the interacting capillary bundle model uses interacting sub capillaries to characterize the angular tube where the first sub capillary characterizes the main meniscus flow and the other sub capillaries represent the corner film flow based on the force balance between capillary viscous gravitational and external forces in terms of pressure difference in each sub capillary the following equations can be derived mingzhe dong et al 2005 jianlin zhao et al 2021 2 h k 1 t h k t i k 1 n q i t i k 1 n Œª w i h k 1 t h k t i 1 k q i t

et al 2021 the accuracy of the interacting capillary bundle model strongly depends on the determination of capillary pressure and viscous force in each sub capillary in previous work jianlin zhao et al 2021 we propose a strategy to decompose the square tube into interacting sub capillaries without shape simplification however this previous work ignores the viscous coupling effect when calculating the conductance of liquid corner flow and only applies to the liquid gas system in this work we use the same decomposition process and calculate the conductance of each sub capillary based on the method introduced in section 2 1 to incorporate the viscous coupling effect to keep the simple format of the interacting capillary bundle model we retain the following extended two phase darcy s law to describe two phase flow 5 q w g sp g r w Œº w g w q n g sp g r n Œº n g n where g r w and g r n are the relative conductance in the extended two phase darcy s law comparing eq 5 with eq 1 we get

accurate due to the quite small time step used in this work through eqs 6 and 7 the viscous coupling effect is introduced into the interacting capillary bundle model which we name the modified interacting capillary bundle model micbm in the following analysis note that for every viscosity ratio the four relative conductance curves versus saturation are determined by interpolation of the existing lbm simulation results 3 model validation to validate the accuracy of micbm we simulate spontaneous imbibition in a strongly wetting square tube for different viscosity ratios and compare the simulation results with high resolution two phase lattice boltzmann simulation results together with the prediction results of icbm developed in our previous work jianlin zhao et al 2021 which neglects the viscous coupling effect the tube counts 100 lattices in width determined after having performed a grid independence test and due to symmetry reasons only one quarter of the tube is simulated the details of the simulation setup can be found in our previous work jianlin zhao et al 2021 initially the tube is saturated with non wetting fluid and a small amount of wetting fluid is placed at the bottom which is the inlet side pressure boundary conditions are used for both the inlet bottom and outlet top boundaries and we set p in p out the wetting fluid moves from inlet to outlet under the capillary force the fluid and tube properties are listed in table 1 where validation means the properties used in this validation case while analysis represents the properties used in the parametric analysis in section 4 as illustrated in our previous work jianlin zhao et al 2021 the lbm simulation generates a continuous interface profile while the interacting capillary bundle model provides a discrete one we compare the imbibition height of wetting corner film for different methods where the film attains a thickness of 24 75 Œºm therefore in both micbm and icbm the thickness of the smallest sub capillary is 24 75 Œºm it should be noted that the number of sub capillaries also influences the accuracy of the prediction result of the interacting capillary bundle model which should be larger than 5 jianlin zhao et al 2021 and is insensitive to the viscosity ratio in this work the square tube is decomposed into 7 sub capillaries for both micbm and icbm fig 3 compares the imbibition dynamics of main meniscus flow of the center and corner film flow for different viscosity ratios considering gravity as can be seen the prediction results of micbm shown in green in general match well with the reference lbm simulation results shown in black demonstrating the accuracy of micbm in describing the imbibition dynamics under different viscosity ratios while the icbm shown in red which was developed for the liquid gas system neglecting viscous coupling effect is inadequate in describing the interaction between main meniscus and corner film flow in addition for one setup it takes thousands of cpu hours for the lbm simulation while it only takes 0 1 cpu hour for the micbm simulation 4 results and analysis after validating micbm we analyze the influence of different parameters on the imbibition dynamics in a strongly wetting square tube with a special focus on the competition between main meniscus and corner film flow 4 1 influence of viscosity ratio on imbibition dynamics two phase flow in porous media is determined by the interaction between viscous and capillary forces lenormand et al 1988 proposed a phase diagram based on this interaction indicating that the invading non wetting phase may show different displacement patterns for different viscosity ratios and capillary numbers during the drainage process motivated by the work of lenormand et al 1988 we firstly analyze the influence of viscosity ratio on the imbibition dynamics of both the main meniscus and the corner film in a square tube table 1 shows the properties of the square tube and fluids used the viscosity ratio is changed by varying the viscosity of the wetting fluid the square tube is decomposed into 7 sub capillaries and the thickness of the smallest sub capillary is 10 Œºm which is the 7th sub capillary and used to describe the corner film length initially the square tube is saturated with non wetting fluid and only 0 5 of the tube at the bottom is filled with wetting fluid we use pressure boundary conditions at the bottom p in and top p out of the square tube which are the inlet and outlet boundaries respectively firstly we set the same pressure at the bottom and top p in p out and simulate spontaneous imbibition of wetting fluid into the tube fig 4 b compares the imbibition dynamics of main meniscus for different viscosity ratios with increasing viscosity ratio or increasing of Œº w as we fix Œº n the imbibition becomes slower for m 1 0 the main meniscus imbibes linearly with time for m 1 0 the imbibition velocity of the main meniscus decreases with time for m 1 0 the imbibition velocity of the main meniscus increases with time to explain this different behavior we use a conceptual interacting capillary bundle model shown in fig 4 a consisting of 2 interacting sub capillaries the 1st sub capillary represents the main meniscus flow while the 2nd one characterizes the corner film flow we note that this conceptual model is only used for mechanism analysis while all the results in fig 4 are obtained with 7 sub capillaries as the wetting corner film is very thin compared with main meniscus it can be assumed that the development of corner film has little influence on the main meniscus flow therefore the imbibition velocity of main meniscus v 1 and corner film v 2 can be approximated by 8 v 1 g 1 p c 1 p in p out a

length or height of i th sub capillary when m 1 0 the denominator of eq 8 is a constant Œº w h resulting in a constant velocity v 1 as shown by the black curve in fig 4 e and h the imbibition velocity of the corner film is initially fast due to the first term in eq 9 caused by a very small corner film length l c h 2 h 1 then it converges to the same velocity as for the main meniscus as shown by the red curve in fig 4 h accordingly we get a stable corner film length l c as shown by the dashed blue line in fig 4 e defined as the difference of imbibition length between main meniscus and corner film l c h 2 h 1 when m 1 0 Œº w Œº n the imbibition velocity of main meniscus can be approximated by v 1 g 1 p c 1 p in p out a 1 Œº w h 1 at initial state h 1 is small which results in a high imbibition velocity of main meniscus with time going h 1 increases and the imbibition velocity of the main meniscus decreases as shown by the black curves in fig 4 d and g while the imbibition dynamics of corner film follows the trend of main meniscus and the corner film length gradually increases with time as shown in fig 4 d and g we find a quasi equilibrium state between main meniscus and corner film flow thus observing that h 2 h 1 v 2 v 1 constant as shown in fig 4 c when m 1 0 the imbibition velocity of main meniscus can be approximated by v 1 g 1 p c 1 p in p out a 1 Œº n h h 1 at initial state h 1 is small which results in a low imbibition velocity of main meniscus as time goes on h 1 increases and the imbibition velocity of the main meniscus increases as shown by the black curve in fig 4 f and i while for the corner film at initial state the corner film length h 2 h 1 is small and first term in eq 9 dominates the imbibition process which results in a high imbibition velocity with increasing corner film length the imbibition velocity of the corner film caused by the first term decreases while the second term becomes increasingly important it is interesting to note that after a certain time the imbibition velocity of corner film is slower than that of the main meniscus which results in a maximum corner film length as shown by the dashed blue curve in fig 4 f whereafter the corner film length decreases with time 4 2 the influence of driving force on imbibition dynamics in this part we study the controlled imbibition process as an external force difference p in p out is applied both the external force and capillary force are driving forces we define a dimensionless driving force p d p c where p d is the driving force and p c is the capillary force of main meniscus p d is calculated as p d p c p in p out by changing the external force term p in p out the dimensionless driving force can be controlled in this section we set the viscosity ratio m 0 125 and all the other parameters are listed in table 1 the initial condition is the same as in the work done in section 4 1 fig 5 shows the imbibition dynamics and velocity of main meniscus and corner film for different dimensionless driving forces as can be seen the imbibition process becomes faster with increasing driving force in addition the development of corner film becomes less significant for a high driving force this can be explained as following the external force has an important influence on the main meniscus flow as shown by eq 8 in previous section with increasing external force the imbibition velocity of the main meniscus becomes faster while the imbibition velocity of the corner film is less sensitive to the external force as the coefficient in second term of eq 9 is usually smaller than 1 therefore for a high dimensionless driving force the imbibition velocity of main meniscus reaches that of corner film at early time as shown in fig 5 d f resulting in a short corner film length it is also interesting to note that for dimensional driving forces equal to 1 0 and 8 0 the imbibition velocity of the corner film first decreases and then after increases as shown in fig 5 e and f the first decreasing stage is caused by an increasing corner film length i e the first term in eq 9 while the second increasing stage is induced by the pushing of the corner film by the main meniscus flowing at high velocity i e the second term in eq 9 4 3 phase diagram characterizing the competition between main meniscus and corner film flow inspired by lenormand s phase diagram lenormand et al 1988 we characterize the competition between main meniscus and corner film flow using the viscosity ratio m and dimensionless driving force p d p c we simulate the imbibition dynamics for different m ranging from 1 64 to 64 and p d p c ranging from 1 256 to 256 fig 6 shows the results of 221 simulations l c is the wetting corner film length at final state when the corner film reaches the outlet and h is the length of the square tube the dimensionless corner film length l c h at final state indicates whether the wetting corner film is prominent the larger l c h the more significant the wetting corner film height fig 6 a and b show the phase diagram in 2d and 3d of the dimensionless corner film length versus driving force and viscosity ratio illustrating the competition between main meniscus and corner film flow fig 6 c and d show the dimensionless corner film length versus driving force and viscosity ratio respectively as can be seen in general the wetting corner film becomes more significant compared with main meniscus with increasing driving force and viscosity ratio the reasons have been analyzed in the previous two sections and we briefly summarize them here the driving force has a more significant influence on the main meniscus flow with increasing dimensionless driving force the imbibition velocity of the main meniscus increases dramatically while that of corner film is less affected accordingly the wetting corner film becomes more prominent with a smaller viscosity ratio which means a lower Œº w the first term in eq 9 becomes larger and dominates the imbibition velocity of corner film resulting in a more significant wetting corner film this phase diagram shows some important implications for porous media applications for example during geological co2 storage it is desired that more co2 to be trapped in sub surface porous media with more significant wetting corner films snap off is more frequent which is beneficial for co2 storage and can be controlled by the injection rates 4 4 influence of gravity on imbibition dynamics when gravity is considered there is an equilibrium height in each sub capillary which is determined by the balance between capillary gravitational and external forces the main meniscus has the lowest equilibrium height due to the smallest capillary force as the imbibition height of main meniscus cannot exceed the equilibrium height the corner film flow becomes more significant as shown in fig 7 a in this figure the red surface illustrates the case with gravity which is located above the blue one without gravity as we use a long square tube in this analysis the dimensionless corner film length at final state is mainly determined by the equilibrium height of the main meniscus therefore the viscosity ratio has less influence on the competition between main meniscus and corner film flow and the dimensionless corner film length strongly depends on the external force as illustrated in fig 7 b in summary gravity counteracts the imbibition process and has a more significant influence on the main meniscus flow compared to corner film making the corner film development more significant 4 5 influence of contact angle on imbibition dynamics different wetting film morphologies will be formed for different contact angles resulting in different capillary pressure and wetting film conductance therefore both the capillary pressure and mobility parameter in eq 2 need to be modified for different contact angles the capillary pressure can be obtained by geometry analysis while the mobility parameter is recalculated through lbm simulations fig 8 below shows the influence of contact angle on the competition between the main meniscus and corner film flow as can be seen with decreasing wetting phase contact angle the dimensionless corner film length increases meaning a more obvious wetting corner film flow the reason is that with decreasing wetting phase contact angle the driving capillary pressure difference Œ¥p c increases and the cross section areas of the sub capillaries in the corners increase increasing the conductances of sub capillaries in corners accordingly the development of corner film is enhanced 4 6 influence of tube length on imbibition dynamics as analyzed in sections 4 1 and 4 2 the longest corner film length during the imbibition process occurs for log m 0 0 or m 1 0 when the tube is not long enough it is possible that the wetting corner film reaches the outlet before reaching its longest corner film length in this section we analyze the influence of tube length on the imbibition dynamics the fluid and tube properties are listed in table 1 with a tube length ranging from 0 2 cm to 25 cm fig 9 compares the phase diagrams of dimensionless corner film length versus driving force and viscosity ratio illustrating the competition between main meniscus and corner film flow for different tube lengths as can be seen when log m is larger than 0 5 the tube length has relatively little influence on the development of wetting corner film the reason is that the corner film flow quickly reaches a quasi equilibrium state with the main meniscus flow for m around or larger than 1 0 as also illustrated in fig 4 d e g and h however when m 1 0 the corner film length increases much faster than the main meniscus does and as a consequence the influence of tube length on the development of corner film becomes more important we further analyze the imbibition dynamics of main meniscus and corner film flow for different tube lengths when p d p c 1 0 and m 0 015625 which corresponds to the point with a star in fig 9 with increasing tube length the total flow resistance inside the tube increases which results in a lower imbibition velocity therefore the time required for the wetting fluid to reach the outlet boundary is not propotional to the tube length as shown in fig 10 when the tube is short the corner film cannot reach its longest value it reaches the outlet boundary before then as illustrated in fig 10 a and b in contrast in fig 10 c and d the corner film length firstly increases to a maximum value and then decreases due to the increasing velocity of main meniscus flow as a consequence the dimensionless corner film length at final state decreases with increasing tube length however we note that with the further increase of tube length the phase diagram almost has no change any more we also note that increasing the tube radius r has the same influence on the competition between main meniscus and corner film flow as decreasing the tube length h it is the ratio between tube length and radius h r that determines the phase diagram more details can be found in the supplementary material 5 conclusion viscous coupling has a significant influence on two phase flow in porous media using two phase lattice boltzmann simulations we determine the conductance of two phase flow through a square tube including the viscous coupling effect and the occurrence of corner flow the results show that the less viscous fluid promotes the mobility of the more viscous fluid due to lubrication effect the obtained conductances for different viscosity ratios and saturation levels including viscous coupling are incorporated into a novel modified interacting capillary bundle model micbm to simulate imbibition in a strongly wetting square tube the accuracy of the new model is validated by comparison with high resolution two phase lattice boltzmann simulation results then this novel micbm is used to analyze the competition between main meniscus and corner film flow during imbibition in a strongly wetting square tube the viscosity ratio m between wetting and non wetting fluids shows a significant influence on the imbibition dynamics for m 1 0 we get a constant imbibition velocity of main meniscus and the corner film length defined as the distance between corner film tip and main meniscus increases to a constant value for m 1 0 the ratio of imbibition velocity between main meniscus and corner film remains constant the imbibition length of corner film is proportional to that of main meniscus and the corner film length increases with time for m 1 0 the imbibition velocity of main meniscus increases with time while that of corner film decreases the corner film length first increases reaching a maximum and then decreases the external driving force affects the imbibition dynamics with increasing external driving force the corner film development becomes less obvious inspired by lenormand s phase diagram lenormand et al 1988 we propose a phase diagram of the corner film length versus viscosity ratio and driving force characterizing the competition between main meniscus and corner film flow in general with decreasing viscosity ratio and dimensionless driving force corner film development becomes more significant as gravity acts as a force resisting the imbibition process it has a more significant influence on the main meniscus flow and as a result corner film development becomes more obvious in addition as expected the corner film becomes more significant with the decrease of contact angle finally the influence of tube length on the competition between main meniscus and corner film flow is analyzed the results show that the tube length has relatively little influence on the development of wetting corner film when m is around 1 0 or larger than 1 0 however when m 1 0 the corner film development becomes less significant with increasing tube length currently this novel micbm only applies to the imbibition process in a single square tube in future research it will be combined with a dynamic pore network model to simulate and analyze imbibition processes in more complex and realistic porous geometries difficulties lie in 1 the extension of the micbm to other angular tubes 2 the connection between different micbms in the complex pore networks and 3 the treatment of some specific multiphase phenomena like snapping off capillary trapping etc in addition it could be further applied to study the drying process explicitly

2723,ground penetrating radar gpr is a non contact measurement method widely used to determine ice thickness which is an important hydrological parameter of rivers in winter the accuracy of gpr measurements of ice thicknesses is highly dependent on the dielectric constant value of ice research on the dielectric constant of ice has mainly focused on pure ice however pure ice is not commonly found in natural rivers in fact hydrodynamic and meteorological factors as well as boundary conditions affect ice in natural rivers which can be treated as a mixture of pure ice air bubbles sediment and pure water therefore the dielectric constant of ice in natural rivers often differs from the theoretical value of pure ice a fact that has often been neglected in prototype measurements during eight years of prototype monitoring in the heilong river and yellow river china it was found that variations in the dielectric constants of ice in the two rivers produced errors in the gpr ice thickness measurements in this study we measure the dielectric constant of ice at 158 measurement points across more than 20 river sections and we present a recommended range of values for the dielectric constant regarding media such as air bubbles sediment and water in natural river ice we analyze sand both dry and wet in ice bound sediment and the effects of air bubbles sediment and water upon the ice s dielectric constant using temperature and voltage measuring rods installed in the ice we demonstrate that the water content in the ice differs significantly according to the freeze up and breakup periods the present study recommends guidelines including suitable timing ice condition and dielectric constant reference values for gpr based ice thickness measurements to improve the measurement accuracy thus this work can serve as a reference for future applications in similar rivers keywords ground penetrating radar dielectric constant of ice ice thickness in situ measurement natural river data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction ice conditions arising in rivers in alpine and high altitude regions around the world often lead to considerable property damage and even loss of lives in china many examples illustrate the important and recurrent impacts of such conditions for instance ice jams attributable to floods occurred in the heilong river in 13 of the 59 years between 1951 and 2010 and the yellow river experienced major ice jams in 26 of the 98 years between 1916 and 2014 fu et al 2020 guo et al 2021 similar incidents in the yukon and st lawrence rivers in the united states and the peace saint john and hay rivers in canada have often caused serious economic losses and even threatened the lives of riverside community residents beltaos 2018 nafziger et al 2019 white and eames 1999 beltaos and burrell 2016 ice thickness is an important parameter in the hydrological monitoring of frozen rivers because it is directly linked to ice related disasters such as ice jams and dams therefore accurate measurements of ice thicknesses in frozen rivers represent a crucial objective for preventing catastrophic events during breakup periods shen 2006 chen et al 2018 the traditional drill hole measurement method has been used for decades and is considered the most reliable procedure for extracting ice thickness measurements however many cold regions exhibit ice thicknesses exceeding 0 8 m and temperatures below 30 c rendering fieldwork extremely challenging this potentially leaves only a limited number of measurement points available and makes it difficult to obtain detailed profiles of the river ice thickness for ice flood prevention measures in contrast the ground penetrating radar gpr method uses electromagnetic waves for non contact measurements through thick ice this technique does not require drilling holes or burying equipment making it more convenient than other measurement methods e g resistance heating lines and satellite altimeters li et al 2005 beckers et al 2017 therefore as an alternative to traditional drill hole methods gpr has been increasingly adopted to measure ice thicknesses in rivers lakes and reservoirs huang et al 2016 brown and duguay 2011 ruffell and parker 2021 galley et al 2009 used gpr with 250 mhz and 1 ghz antennas to measure ice thicknesses in the churchill river they obtained accurate results with a mean absolute error approximately equal to 0 03 m equivalent to a 3 6 mean percentage error in the case of 1 2 m thick ice tretjakova et al 2019 applied gpr with 75 300 and 500 mhz antennas and found that the accuracy of gpr based ice thickness measurements was poor when suspended frazil ice were present under the ice fu et al 2018 developed a dual frequency gpr to simultaneously measure ice thickness and water depth successfully applying it in measurements of the heilong and yellow rivers and the wanjiazhai reservoir k√§m√§ri et al 2017 used an 800 mhz gpr to measure river ice thicknesses they achieved a mean absolute error of 0 03 m equivalent to a 5 mean percentage error in the case of 0 5 m thick ice zhang et al 2017 compared the measurement accuracy of the drill hole method with respect to gpr frequencies for measurements in the yellow river at frequencies of 200 400 900 and 1500 mhz for 0 35 m thick ice the mean absolute measurement errors were 0 02 0 03 0 03 and 0 03 m respectively thus the mean percentage errors were evaluated as 6 9 8 and 10 respectively at a basic level the gpr method uses a radar system equipped with transmitting and receiving antennas the radar system is placed on the ground and high frequency short pulse electromagnetic waves are transmitted into the ice via the transmitting antenna the waves encounter underground formations or targets of different electrical properties and are reflected to the ground surface where they are collected by the receiving antenna the thickness h of the measured medium here ice can be obtained as galley et al 2009 1 h c 2 t 2 Œµ d 2 4 Œµ where Œµ is the dielectric constant of ice h is the ice thickness or water depth t is the two way travel time in the measured medium d is the distance between the transmitting and receiving antennas of the radar system and c 30 cm ns is the velocity of electromagnetic waves in vacuum as seen from eq 1 the dielectric constant is a decisive parameter when measuring ice thickness via the gpr technique hence the accuracy of its value is very important for improving the overall measurement accuracy existing research on the dielectric constant of ice has basically focused on pure ice zeng et al 2010 and arcone and delaney 1987 reported the dielectric constant of pure ice as being 3 2 however shivola 1989 and shokr 1998 suggested a value of 3 15 evans 1965 found that the dielectric constant of pure ice fluctuated in the range of 3 15 0 05 koh 1997 determined the complex dielectric constant of bubble free ice grown from deionized water to be 3 17 it is worth noting that pure ice from pure or deionized water rarely occurs in natural rivers more often ice in natural rivers comprises a mixture of pure ice air bubbles sediment and pure water see fig 1 in more complex cases ice blocks can stack together forming ice exhibiting high porosity during hydraulic and mechanical thickening as a result the dielectric constant of ice in natural rivers tends to deviate from its theoretical value drastically in some cases despite the significance of obtaining an accurate dielectric constant value for ice the problem of mixed materials and associated deviations remains poorly investigated this constitutes one of the main problems tackled in the present study during eight years of prototype observations in the heilong and yellow rivers china variations in the dielectric constants of ice in these two rivers have produced errors in the gpr ice thickness measurements in this study we investigated the process of determining the dielectric constant values of ice in natural rivers for this process ice thickness was measured using both drill hole and gpr measurements at identical locations in the yellow and heilong rivers during the ice periods of 2015 2016 2017 and 2019 drill hole measurements were used to obtain reliable ice thicknesses and the gpr technique was used to obtain the values of the two way travel time t from the obtained data the dielectric constant values of the ice at 158 measurement points in the yellow and heilong rivers were calculated using eq 1 furthermore the main factors affecting the accuracy in gpr based measurements of ice thickness were analyzed our findings can provide a reference for future ice thickness measurements of similar rivers under winter conditions 2 prototype study method and site the yellow and heilong rivers are located in the central and northeastern regions of china respectively the waters of the heilong river are clear with low sediment content hence ice often appears transparent or white in contrast the yellow river has a high sediment content and most of the ice appears yellow however a few river sections appear clearer owing to lower flow velocities straighter courses and lower sediment content prototype tests to estimate the dielectric constant were performed at different measurement sites and different time periods the beiji village section of the heilong river from december 28 2015 to january 10 2016 21 measurement points the longdao wharf section of the heilong river between april 7 and 17 2017 58 measurement points the tuoketuo county section of the yellow river between january 15 and 20 2017 20 measurement points the 700 km baotou xinjian section of the yellow river between january 20 and 30 2019 59 measurement points the specific locations of the surveyed river sections are shown in fig 2 for drill hole measurements of ice thickness an l shaped ice measuring ruler was used with an accuracy of 1 mm see fig 3 a the gpr measurement employed a dual frequency radar developed by the china institute of water resources and hydropower research with antennas operating at 1500 mhz for ice thickness measurements see fig 3b the density of the ice was approximately 917 kg m3 indicating that most of the ice was immersed in water the pores of porous ice are likely to be filled with water and as such there may be a considerable increase in the dielectric constant owing to the high dielectric constant of water for example the dielectric constant of dry sediment is 3 5 whereas that of saturated sediment is 23 30 zeng et al 2010 the dielectric constants were 81 for water 5 for sediment and 1 for air bubbles zeng et al 2010 lunt et al 2005 the water content has the largest influence on the dielectric constant of ice therefore the water content tests were also performed in the beiji village section of the heilong river between december 30 2015 and april 6 2016 if the temperature inside the ice is significantly lower than the freezing point 0 c then water freezes and becomes ice otherwise liquid water might still be present inside the ice and the presence of such water can be verified by measuring the temperature profile another method to determine whether water is present inside the ice is based on voltage changes caused by the difference between the resistances of ice and water natural river water contains impurities that offer good electrical conductivity the resistance value is generally a few kiloohms to a few hundred kiloohms however conductivity decreases when water freezes with the resistance varying between 10 and 300 mœâ based on the voltage division rule and 2 v 2 r 2 r 1 r 2 v cc the circuit can be designed as shown in fig 4 in eq 2 vcc is a fixed direct current power supply 3 3 v r 1 is the electrical resistance of air ice or water between two electrodes r 2 is the divider resistance whose value is known and v 2 is the voltage across r 2 by measuring the divided voltage v 2 across the divider resistance r 2 it is possible to determine whether ice or water is present between the two measurement points by setting multiple measurement points and sequentially measuring the corresponding values of v 2 at adjacent points the continuous measurement of water within the ice can be realized fig 5 cui et al 2015 used this method to measure ice thickness in the current study the temperature and voltage measuring rods were expanded to measure the water content in the ice following the two abovementioned methods temperature and voltage measuring rods were installed for tests in the beiji village section of the heilong river between december 30 2015 and april 6 2016 see fig 6 the measuring rod was 2 0 m long with 200 temperature or resistance electrodes placed at 0 01 m increments the accuracy of the temperature measurement was 0 1 c and that of the voltage measurement was 0 01 v 3 prototype study results 3 1 test in the beiji village section of the heilong river 2015 2016 3 1 1 dielectric constant measurement twenty one measurement points 53 29 28 36 n 122 22 0 97 e were investigated in the beiji village section of the heilong river from december 28 2015 to january 10 2016 corresponding to the freeze up period in this section the date of the breakup was may 1 fig 7 shows the course of the surveyed river reaches and the morphology of the ice surface in the upper and lower reaches the ice surface was smooth in the upper reach whereas ice had accumulated in the lower reach through hydraulic thickening it was visually observed from the ice surface that the porosity of the ice in the lower reach significantly exceeded that of the upper reach following drill hole and gpr measurements the ice thickness as measured with the l shaped ruler and the calculated dielectric constant for each measurement point are shown in fig 8 a for the 21 measurement points from upper to lower reach the ice thickness varied from 0 46 to 0 78 m and the dielectric constant ranged from 3 05 to 4 80 the upper reach of the tested river exhibited less fluctuation in its dielectric constant approximately 3 4 the fluctuations in the lower reach gradually increased up to a maximum of 4 8 primarily influenced by the morphology of the accumulated ice in the lower reach where the porosity of the ice block was high if the freeze up period is insufficient the water in the ice may not be completely frozen significantly increasing the dielectric constant of the ice furthermore the porosity of ice varies considerably through stochastic ice accumulation which further increases the fluctuation of the dielectric constant of ice in the lower reach based on the measured data from the 21 points we analyzed the influence of the dielectric constant value on the measurement accuracy from the plot of the average relative error with respect to the dielectric constant see fig 8b we found a minimum average relative error of 4 88 when the dielectric constant was 3 65 if the theoretical value of the dielectric constant for ice i e 3 2 was adopted for the gpr measurement this error would increase to 7 42 3 1 2 measurement of water content in ice temperature and voltage measuring rods were tested in the beiji village section of the heilong river between december 30 2015 and april 6 2016 considering that the prototype observation may be carried out during the day and the outside air temperature is significantly higher in the afternoon four daily monitoring data collected at 8 00 a m and 2 00p m were selected for analysis from the freeze up period to the breakup period the measured temperature and voltage distributions of the measuring rods are shown in figs 9 and 10 respectively fig 9a c and 10a c depict the freeze up period whereas fig 9d and 10d depict the breakup period snow ice and water exhibit significantly different temperature gradient distributions owing to their different heat transfer properties the upper surface temperature of snow is the same as that of air and its lower surface temperature is 5 20 c higher than that of the upper surface temperature because of the insulation effect of snow fig 9a g the water temperature near ice is 0 c the upper and lower surface temperatures of ice are therefore equal to the lower surface temperature of snow and the temperature of water respectively therefore the air snow snow ice and ice water interfaces can be clearly identified as seen in figs 9 and 10 during the freeze up period despite the insulation effect of the snow layer the internal temperature of the ice throughout the freeze up period remained between 5 c and 10 c eliminating the possibility of water inside the ice in contrast during the breakup period the internal temperature of the ice increased to approximately 0 c fig 9d and 9 h and the ice water interface was no longer distinguishable indicating that ice and water coexisted the voltage distribution obtained with the measuring rod is shown in fig 10 the measurement points denoted by a circle in the figures were manually shorted out with a voltage of approximately 3 3 v to facilitate identification of the ice surface ice exhibits poor electrical conductivity and its corresponding voltage value is significantly lower than that of water which is approximately 3 1 v if water is present in the ice voltage fluctuations should be observable as shown in fig 10 the ice kept growing and thickening downward between january 15 and march 15 owing to the continuous loss of heat in the water throughout the freeze up period see fig 10a c and 10e g the voltage fluctuations inside the ice were minimal thus it can be assumed that no water was present within the ice after entering the breakup period see fig 10d and 10 h the voltage inside the ice generally increased and the voltage values at several measurement points were close to the voltage of the water indicating a significant increase in the volume of water inside the ice during the breakup period 3 2 test in the longdao wharf section of the heilong river in 2017 measurements were performed at 58 points 53 27 31 40 n 122 29 41 63 e in the longdao wharf section of the heilong river between april 7 and 17 2017 see fig 11 this was the last stage of ice cover on the longdao wharf section because the date of the breakup was may 3 the ice surface of the upper reach of the longdao wharf section was formed through juxtaposed thickening with a snow thickness of approximately 2 cm the ice surface of the lower reach was formed thermodynamically thus it was flat and smooth with almost no snow cover 1 cm in a few areas owing to the large fluctuations in the dielectric constant from the previous test in 2016 three ice samples were obtained via cutting to determine the content of the ice in 2017 as shown in fig 12 the ice samples taken were all clear dense and solid ice fig 13 a shows the measured ice thickness and calculated dielectric constant values for 58 measurement points the ice thickness of the tested river section varied between 0 52 and 1 39 m and the dielectric constant values varied between 3 34 and 3 82 ice in the longdao wharf section was subject to juxtaposed thickening and thermodynamic ice growth the dielectric constant exhibited minimal fluctuation especially for the measurement points denoted by the dashed box in the figure the thickness of the ice cover fluctuated substantially between 0 4 and 1 4 m however the dielectric constant values remained largely unaltered indicating a minimal variation in the value of the dielectric constant for dense and pure solid ice formed via juxtaposed thickening and thermodynamic ice growth processes the plot of the dielectric constant value and average relative error see fig 13b shows that the error first decreased from 8 83 to 0 66 and then increased to 8 80 while the dielectric constant increased from 2 8 to 4 2 the minimum average relative error 0 66 was found for the measured dielectric constant value of 3 50 considering a theoretical value of 3 2 would increase the average relative error significantly to 4 49 therefore the gpr method offers a stronger measurement accuracy for ice formed thermodynamically or from juxtaposed thickening processes 3 3 test in the tuoketuo county section of the yellow river in 2017 two surveys were conducted in the tuoketuo county section of the yellow river between january 15 and 20 2017 with a total of 20 measurement points 40 17 45 63 n 111 3 1 61 e the date of the breakup was march 21 the measurements were conducted at a 180 bend as shown in fig 14 considering the high content of sediment in the yellow river its ice surface shows a distinct yellow color whereas the white part denotes snow on the surface a radar with a 1500 mhz antenna was used to measure the ice thickness of the yellow river under conditions of relatively high sediment content and the processed radar echo image clearly shows the bottom of the ice the tuoketuo county section has a unique 180 bend hence the ice cover was formed primarily through hydrodynamic processes after a series of processes e g collision crushing and breaking the ice from the upper reaches accumulated and froze to form stable ice thus the formation of the ice was highly randomized and its composition was complex the ice samples obtained from lines 1 and 2 are shown in fig 15 six of the ten ice samples contained significant sediment most ice samples exhibited columnar ice in the lower region and granular ice in the upper one only certain parts of the ice samples were pure ice these were structurally similar to the columnar ice samples taken from the heilong river see fig 15b and 15c the measured ice thicknesses and calculated dielectric constant values for the 20 measurement points are shown in fig 16 with ice thicknesses ranging from 0 44 to 0 64 m given the complexity of the ice composition the values of the dielectric constant at each measurement point varied considerably between 2 54 and 5 13 the minimum average relative error was 7 7 when the dielectric constant was set to 3 2 the above results indicate that the mixture of media has a sizeable influence on the accuracy of the gpr based ice thickness measurement 3 4 test from baotou city section to xinjian village section of the yellow river in 2019 between january 20 and 30 2019 dielectric constant measurements were taken in the upper reaches of the yellow river in a river course of approximately 700 km baotou city xinjian village with 17 measurement sections and 59 measurement points the date of the breakup was march 23 the ice conditions at the location of the measurement section and the radar echo images of typical measurement points are listed in table 1 to provide a reference for similar ice measurements using gpr as described earlier the 180 bend section had been surveyed in 2017 therefore the present survey investigated the straight section of the yellow river to study the dielectric constant of ice where ice was more widely distributed thereby offering more valuable data for hydrological monitoring in fact january is the freeze up period of the upper reaches of the yellow river except for the ice in the xishiwuqingdi village characterized by hydraulic thickening the rest of the measured sections primarily feature ice formed by juxtaposed thickening and thermodynamic processes the photographs of ice surfaces in table 1 indicate that the ice in all sections contained sediment ice from the xishiwuqingdi village jinqi village machangdi village and fumaoxi village sections were visibly brown or yellow in color with high sediment content the ice in the remaining sections had a lower sediment content and was similar to pure ice under the ice conditions shown in table 1 clear echo images were obtained using gpr with 1500 mhz antennas after image processing ice surface and ice bottom locations were easily obtained the dielectric constant and ice thickness values for each measurement point are shown in fig 17 a for the 59 measurement points the ice thickness ranged from 0 3 to 0 88 m and the corresponding dielectric constant values ranged from 2 72 to 3 78 these values were essentially consistent except for two measurement points where the dielectric constants deviated considerably when the dielectric constant was considered as 3 25 the average relative error of the 59 measurement points reached a minimum value of 1 34 see fig 17b 4 discussion 4 1 dielectric constant of ice in the heilong river and yellow river ice sample inspections and dielectric constant measurements clearly indicate that the ice of natural rivers comprises pure ice sediment air pure water and other media these substances are affected by factors such as air water temperature and river hydrodynamic processes thus their dielectric constants frequently deviate from the theoretical value to some extent comparing the 2015 2016 and 2017 dielectric constant tests of the heilong river dielectric constant values exhibited variations attributable to different ice morphologies for a theoretical pure ice dielectric constant value of 3 2 the errors in the gpr based ice thickness measurements were 7 42 2015 2016 and 4 49 2017 reasonable values of 3 65 and 3 50 were chosen for the dielectric constant reducing the average relative errors in the measurement to 4 88 and 0 66 respectively significantly improving the measurement accuracy comparing the 2017 and 2019 dielectric constant tests of the yellow river the accuracy of the gpr based ice thickness measurement at the river bend was poor owing to the complex composition of the mixture of ice in the yellow river however the measurement accuracy was more satisfactory when measuring the ice cover in the straight section of the river the dielectric constant of the ice for the yellow river was lower than that of the heilong river for the tuoketuo county section the minimum average relative error was 7 7 when the dielectric constant was set to 3 2 for the straight section the minimum average relative error was 1 34 when the dielectric constant was set to 3 25 both the temperature and voltage data obtained using the measuring rods indicate that only a very small amount of water remained inside the ice during the freeze up period but this amount increased significantly during the breakup period thus the gpr based ice thickness measurement should be carried out during the freeze up period according to the test results measured at 8 00 a m and 2 00p m the higher air temperature in the afternoon had no observable impact on the water content in the ice 4 2 sediment and air bubbles in the ice zhang et al 2021 conducted field observations and obtained 86 ice samples from the inner mongolia section of the yellow river between 2015 and 2020 after data analysis they concluded that the sediment content in the ice was 0 001 36 039 kg m3 granular ice contains 3 42 1 41 air bubbles while columnar ice contains 2 57 1 09 air bubbles li et al 2010 measured the content of air bubbles in ice formed via thermo hydrological processes in the hongqipao reservoir and found that the bubble content was less than 1 sediment and air bubbles in water are strongly influenced by hydrodynamics in rivers with strong water turbulence chunks of ice collide with each other and squeeze and scrape the riverbanks increasing their porosity and sediment content after freezing ice is likely to contain more air bubbles and sediment particles for rivers lakes and reservoirs with low flow turbulences ice is mostly formed via thermodynamic ice growth and tends to contain fewer air bubbles and less sediment another issue that requires attention is the state of sediment water can be adsorbed by sediment particles and wrap around their surfaces producing a sudden increase in the dielectric constant hence it is important to identify whether the sediment content in the ice is wet or dry to differentiate between the two we can refer to the research results of frozen soil frozen soil is a mixture of pure ice and sediment in similar compositions the difference is that frozen soil contains more sediment li et al 2007 used the e8362b pna microwave network analyzer by agilent and a high and low temperature test box to study the variation patterns of dielectric constants in soil samples at different temperatures and water volume fractions i e 5 10 15 20 25 and 30 they found that in the frequency range of 1 20 ghz the dielectric constant of frozen soil showed minimal variation when the soil temperature was lower than 0 c with frozen water around the sediment grains however a sudden increase in the dielectric constant of the soil sample was observed when the soil temperature exceeded 0 c i e when the ice in the soil changed to water song et al 2011 studied the variation patterns of dielectric constants at different temperatures for two silty clay samples with 31 44 and 36 73 water content similar findings were obtained when the soil temperature was below 0 c the dielectric constant of the soil samples was approximately 4 with minimal variations when the soil temperature exceeded 0 c the dielectric constant jumped to approximately 32 therefore over the freeze up period when the internal temperature of the ice was less than 0 c the sediment in the ice could be considered dry however during the breakup period the sediment could be considered wet 5 conclusions ice thickness is an important hydrological parameter of rivers in winter however calculations based upon ice dielectric constants tend to be inaccurate for natural rivers owing to the inhomogeneous composition of river ice after eight years of prototype monitoring in the heilong river and yellow river 158 measuring points were compared using the drill hole and gpr methods our findings show that for the heilong river the minimum average relative error was 0 66 for the ice surface formed via a juxtaposed thickening process with a dielectric constant of 3 5 whereas the error was 4 88 for an ice surface formed via abrupt thickening with a dielectric constant of 3 65 for the yellow river the minimum average relative error was 1 34 for an ice surface formed via juxtaposed thickening with a dielectric constant of 3 25 and it was 7 7 for an ice surface at the 180 bend with a dielectric constant of 3 2 according to the measured temperature and voltage distributions in the ice from the heilong river it is less likely that juxtaposed ice will contain water throughout the freeze up period however numerous water bodies may be present in the ice during the breakup period the proposed guidelines for performing gpr based measurements are as follows 1 adopting gpr for ice thickness measurements throughout the freeze up period is recommended as it can mitigate the influences of the most critical factors in measurement accuracy when the daily mean air temperature rises above 0 c it is regarded as the beginning of the breakup period 2 the straight section of the river and the smooth cover juxtaposed cover should be preferred over the curved section of the river and rough cover 3 before measurement the ice surface and impurities in the ice must be visually observed for a smooth cover juxtaposed cover similar to that shown in fig 11b the dielectric constant can be taken as 3 5 if sediments are observed similar to the case presented in table 1 the dielectric constant can be taken as 3 25 4 if the ice thickness of a sharp corner needs to be measured similar to that shown in fig 14a the dielectric constant can be taken as 3 2 however the measurement error may be approximately 8 or more to improve the measurement accuracy ice samples are needed to calibrate the dielectric constant 5 avoid measuring after snowfall or when the snow cover is thick snow hides the potholes present on the surface of ice which can be dangerous moreover thick snow cover reduces the measurement accuracy if the snow cover is similar to that shown in fig 7b the dielectric constant can be taken as 3 65 this study suffers from several limitations first the ice composition of natural rivers is complex for example snow cover can appear in various forms e g dry snow wet snow and even snow slush under different temperatures and solar radiation conditions second the interior of an ice jam or ice dam may incompletely freeze during winter therefore methods for improving the accuracy of ice thickness measurements using the gpr technique under such complex conditions still require further exploration in future research we hope our findings will improve the accuracy of ice thickness measurements in rivers and thereby improve the safety and livelihoods of people who live or work near similar river systems credit authorship contribution statement hui fu methodology writing original draft xinlei

2723,ground penetrating radar gpr is a non contact measurement method widely used to determine ice thickness which is an important hydrological parameter of rivers in winter the accuracy of gpr measurements of ice thicknesses is highly dependent on the dielectric constant value of ice research on the dielectric constant of ice has mainly focused on pure ice however pure ice is not commonly found in natural rivers in fact hydrodynamic and meteorological factors as well as boundary conditions affect ice in natural rivers which can be treated as a mixture of pure ice air bubbles sediment and pure water therefore the dielectric constant of ice in natural rivers often differs from the theoretical value of pure ice a fact that has often been neglected in prototype measurements during eight years of prototype monitoring in the heilong river and yellow river china it was found that variations in the dielectric constants of ice in the two rivers produced errors in the gpr ice thickness measurements in this study we measure the dielectric constant of ice at 158 measurement points across more than 20 river sections and we present a recommended range of values for the dielectric constant regarding media such as air bubbles sediment and water in natural river ice we analyze sand both dry and wet in ice bound sediment and the effects of air bubbles sediment and water upon the ice s dielectric constant using temperature and voltage measuring rods installed in the ice we demonstrate that the water content in the ice differs significantly according to the freeze up and breakup periods the present study recommends guidelines including suitable timing ice condition and dielectric constant reference values for gpr based ice thickness measurements to improve the measurement accuracy thus this work can serve as a reference for future applications in similar rivers keywords ground penetrating radar dielectric constant of ice ice thickness in situ measurement natural river data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction ice conditions arising in rivers in alpine and high altitude regions around the world often lead to considerable property damage and even loss of lives in china many examples illustrate the important and recurrent impacts of such conditions for instance ice jams attributable to floods occurred in the heilong river in 13 of the 59 years between 1951 and 2010 and the yellow river experienced major ice jams in 26 of the 98 years between 1916 and 2014 fu et al 2020 guo et al 2021 similar incidents in the yukon and st lawrence rivers in the united states and the peace saint john and hay rivers in canada have often caused serious economic losses and even threatened the lives of riverside community residents beltaos 2018 nafziger et al 2019 white and eames 1999 beltaos and burrell 2016 ice thickness is an important parameter in the hydrological monitoring of frozen rivers because it is directly linked to ice related disasters such as ice jams and dams therefore accurate measurements of ice thicknesses in frozen rivers represent a crucial objective for preventing catastrophic events during breakup periods shen 2006 chen et al 2018 the traditional drill hole measurement method has been used for decades and is considered the most reliable procedure for extracting ice thickness measurements however many cold regions exhibit ice thicknesses exceeding 0 8 m and temperatures below 30 c rendering fieldwork extremely challenging this potentially leaves only a limited number of measurement points available and makes it difficult to obtain detailed profiles of the river ice thickness for ice flood prevention measures in contrast the ground penetrating radar gpr method uses electromagnetic waves for non contact measurements through thick ice this technique does not require drilling holes or burying equipment making it more convenient than other measurement methods e g resistance heating lines and satellite altimeters li et al 2005 beckers et al 2017 therefore as an alternative to traditional drill hole methods gpr has been increasingly adopted to measure ice thicknesses in rivers lakes and reservoirs huang et al 2016 brown and duguay 2011 ruffell and parker 2021 galley et al 2009 used gpr with 250 mhz and 1 ghz antennas to measure ice thicknesses in the churchill river they obtained accurate results with a mean absolute error approximately equal to 0 03 m equivalent to a 3 6 mean percentage error in the case of 1 2 m thick ice tretjakova et al 2019 applied gpr with 75 300 and 500 mhz antennas and found that the accuracy of gpr based ice thickness measurements was poor when suspended frazil ice were present under the ice fu et al 2018 developed a dual frequency gpr to simultaneously measure ice thickness and water depth successfully applying it in measurements of the heilong and yellow rivers and the wanjiazhai reservoir k√§m√§ri et al 2017 used an 800 mhz gpr to measure river ice thicknesses they achieved a mean absolute error of 0 03 m equivalent to a 5 mean percentage error in the case of 0 5 m thick ice zhang et al 2017 compared the measurement accuracy of the drill hole method with respect to gpr frequencies for measurements in the yellow river at frequencies of 200 400 900 and 1500 mhz for 0 35 m thick ice the mean absolute measurement errors were 0 02 0 03 0 03 and 0 03 m respectively thus the mean percentage errors were evaluated as 6 9 8 and 10 respectively at a basic level the gpr method uses a radar system equipped with transmitting and receiving antennas the radar system is placed on the ground and high frequency short pulse electromagnetic waves are transmitted into the ice via the transmitting antenna the waves encounter underground formations or targets of different electrical properties and are reflected to the ground surface where they are collected by the receiving antenna the thickness h of the measured medium here ice can be obtained as galley et al 2009 1 h c 2 t 2 Œµ d 2 4 Œµ where Œµ is the dielectric constant of ice h is the ice thickness or water depth t is the two way travel time in the measured medium d is the distance between the transmitting and receiving antennas of the radar system and c 30 cm ns is the velocity of electromagnetic waves in vacuum as seen from eq 1 the dielectric constant is a decisive parameter when measuring ice thickness via the gpr technique hence the accuracy of its value is very important for improving the overall measurement accuracy existing research on the dielectric constant of ice has basically focused on pure ice zeng et al 2010 and arcone and delaney 1987 reported the dielectric constant of pure ice as being 3 2 however shivola 1989 and shokr 1998 suggested a value of 3 15 evans 1965 found that the dielectric constant of pure ice fluctuated in the range of 3 15 0 05 koh 1997 determined the complex dielectric constant of bubble free ice grown from deionized water to be 3 17 it is worth noting that pure ice from pure or deionized water rarely occurs in natural rivers more often ice in natural rivers comprises a mixture of pure ice air bubbles sediment and pure water see fig 1 in more complex cases ice blocks can stack together forming ice exhibiting high porosity during hydraulic and mechanical thickening as a result the dielectric constant of ice in natural rivers tends to deviate from its theoretical value drastically in some cases despite the significance of obtaining an accurate dielectric constant value for ice the problem of mixed materials and associated deviations remains poorly investigated this constitutes one of the main problems tackled in the present study during eight years of prototype observations in the heilong and yellow rivers china variations in the dielectric constants of ice in these two rivers have produced errors in the gpr ice thickness measurements in this study we investigated the process of determining the dielectric constant values of ice in natural rivers for this process ice thickness was measured using both drill hole and gpr measurements at identical locations in the yellow and heilong rivers during the ice periods of 2015 2016 2017 and 2019 drill hole measurements were used to obtain reliable ice thicknesses and the gpr technique was used to obtain the values of the two way travel time t from the obtained data the dielectric constant values of the ice at 158 measurement points in the yellow and heilong rivers were calculated using eq 1 furthermore the main factors affecting the accuracy in gpr based measurements of ice thickness were analyzed our findings can provide a reference for future ice thickness measurements of similar rivers under winter conditions 2 prototype study method and site the yellow and heilong rivers are located in the central and northeastern regions of china respectively the waters of the heilong river are clear with low sediment content hence ice often appears transparent or white in contrast the yellow river has a high sediment content and most of the ice appears yellow however a few river sections appear clearer owing to lower flow velocities straighter courses and lower sediment content prototype tests to estimate the dielectric constant were performed at different measurement sites and different time periods the beiji village section of the heilong river from december 28 2015 to january 10 2016 21 measurement points the longdao wharf section of the heilong river between april 7 and 17 2017 58 measurement points the tuoketuo county section of the yellow river between january 15 and 20 2017 20 measurement points the 700 km baotou xinjian section of the yellow river between january 20 and 30 2019 59 measurement points the specific locations of the surveyed river sections are shown in fig 2 for drill hole measurements of ice thickness an l shaped ice measuring ruler was used with an accuracy of 1 mm see fig 3 a the gpr measurement employed a dual frequency radar developed by the china institute of water resources and hydropower research with antennas operating at 1500 mhz for ice thickness measurements see fig 3b the density of the ice was approximately 917 kg m3 indicating that most of the ice was immersed in water the pores of porous ice are likely to be filled with water and as such there may be a considerable increase in the dielectric constant owing to the high dielectric constant of water for example the dielectric constant of dry sediment is 3 5 whereas that of saturated sediment is 23 30 zeng et al 2010 the dielectric constants were 81 for water 5 for sediment and 1 for air bubbles zeng et al 2010 lunt et al 2005 the water content has the largest influence on the dielectric constant of ice therefore the water content tests were also performed in the beiji village section of the heilong river between december 30 2015 and april 6 2016 if the temperature inside the ice is significantly lower than the freezing point 0 c then water freezes and becomes ice otherwise liquid water might still be present inside the ice and the presence of such water can be verified by measuring the temperature profile another method to determine whether water is present inside the ice is based on voltage changes caused by the difference between the resistances of ice and water natural river water contains impurities that offer good electrical conductivity the resistance value is generally a few kiloohms to a few hundred kiloohms however conductivity decreases when water freezes with the resistance varying between 10 and 300 mœâ based on the voltage division rule and 2 v 2 r 2 r 1 r 2 v cc the circuit can be designed as shown in fig 4 in eq 2 vcc is a fixed direct current power supply 3 3 v r 1 is the electrical resistance of air ice or water between two electrodes r 2 is the divider resistance whose value is known and v 2 is the voltage across r 2 by measuring the divided voltage v 2 across the divider resistance r 2 it is possible to determine whether ice or water is present between the two measurement points by setting multiple measurement points and sequentially measuring the corresponding values of v 2 at adjacent points the continuous measurement of water within the ice can be realized fig 5 cui et al 2015 used this method to measure ice thickness in the current study the temperature and voltage measuring rods were expanded to measure the water content in the ice following the two abovementioned methods temperature and voltage measuring rods were installed for tests in the beiji village section of the heilong river between december 30 2015 and april 6 2016 see fig 6 the measuring rod was 2 0 m long with 200 temperature or resistance electrodes placed at 0 01 m increments the accuracy of the temperature measurement was 0 1 c and that of the voltage measurement was 0 01 v 3 prototype study results 3 1 test in the beiji village section of the heilong river 2015 2016 3 1 1 dielectric constant measurement twenty one measurement points 53 29 28 36 n 122 22 0 97 e were investigated in the beiji village section of the heilong river from december 28 2015 to january 10 2016 corresponding to the freeze up period in this section the date of the breakup was may 1 fig 7 shows the course of the surveyed river reaches and the morphology of the ice surface in the upper and lower reaches the ice surface was smooth in the upper reach whereas ice had accumulated in the lower reach through hydraulic thickening it was visually observed from the ice surface that the porosity of the ice in the lower reach significantly exceeded that of the upper reach following drill hole and gpr measurements the ice thickness as measured with the l shaped ruler and the calculated dielectric constant for each measurement point are shown in fig 8 a for the 21 measurement points from upper to lower reach the ice thickness varied from 0 46 to 0 78 m and the dielectric constant ranged from 3 05 to 4 80 the upper reach of the tested river exhibited less fluctuation in its dielectric constant approximately 3 4 the fluctuations in the lower reach gradually increased up to a maximum of 4 8 primarily influenced by the morphology of the accumulated ice in the lower reach where the porosity of the ice block was high if the freeze up period is insufficient the water in the ice may not be completely frozen significantly increasing the dielectric constant of the ice furthermore the porosity of ice varies considerably through stochastic ice accumulation which further increases the fluctuation of the dielectric constant of ice in the lower reach based on the measured data from the 21 points we analyzed the influence of the dielectric constant value on the measurement accuracy from the plot of the average relative error with respect to the dielectric constant see fig 8b we found a minimum average relative error of 4 88 when the dielectric constant was 3 65 if the theoretical value of the dielectric constant for ice i e 3 2 was adopted for the gpr measurement this error would increase to 7 42 3 1 2 measurement of water content in ice temperature and voltage measuring rods were tested in the beiji village section of the heilong river between december 30 2015 and april 6 2016 considering that the prototype observation may be carried out during the day and the outside air temperature is significantly higher in the afternoon four daily monitoring data collected at 8 00 a m and 2 00p m were selected for analysis from the freeze up period to the breakup period the measured temperature and voltage distributions of the measuring rods are shown in figs 9 and 10 respectively fig 9a c and 10a c depict the freeze up period whereas fig 9d and 10d depict the breakup period snow ice and water exhibit significantly different temperature gradient distributions owing to their different heat transfer properties the upper surface temperature of snow is the same as that of air and its lower surface temperature is 5 20 c higher than that of the upper surface temperature because of the insulation effect of snow fig 9a g the water temperature near ice is 0 c the upper and lower surface temperatures of ice are therefore equal to the lower surface temperature of snow and the temperature of water respectively therefore the air snow snow ice and ice water interfaces can be clearly identified as seen in figs 9 and 10 during the freeze up period despite the insulation effect of the snow layer the internal temperature of the ice throughout the freeze up period remained between 5 c and 10 c eliminating the possibility of water inside the ice in contrast during the breakup period the internal temperature of the ice increased to approximately 0 c fig 9d and 9 h and the ice water interface was no longer distinguishable indicating that ice and water coexisted the voltage distribution obtained with the measuring rod is shown in fig 10 the measurement points denoted by a circle in the figures were manually shorted out with a voltage of approximately 3 3 v to facilitate identification of the ice surface ice exhibits poor electrical conductivity and its corresponding voltage value is significantly lower than that of water which is approximately 3 1 v if water is present in the ice voltage fluctuations should be observable as shown in fig 10 the ice kept growing and thickening downward between january 15 and march 15 owing to the continuous loss of heat in the water throughout the freeze up period see fig 10a c and 10e g the voltage fluctuations inside the ice were minimal thus it can be assumed that no water was present within the ice after entering the breakup period see fig 10d and 10 h the voltage inside the ice generally increased and the voltage values at several measurement points were close to the voltage of the water indicating a significant increase in the volume of water inside the ice during the breakup period 3 2 test in the longdao wharf section of the heilong river in 2017 measurements were performed at 58 points 53 27 31 40 n 122 29 41 63 e in the longdao wharf section of the heilong river between april 7 and 17 2017 see fig 11 this was the last stage of ice cover on the longdao wharf section because the date of the breakup was may 3 the ice surface of the upper reach of the longdao wharf section was formed through juxtaposed thickening with a snow thickness of approximately 2 cm the ice surface of the lower reach was formed thermodynamically thus it was flat and smooth with almost no snow cover 1 cm in a few areas owing to the large fluctuations in the dielectric constant from the previous test in 2016 three ice samples were obtained via cutting to determine the content of the ice in 2017 as shown in fig 12 the ice samples taken were all clear dense and solid ice fig 13 a shows the measured ice thickness and calculated dielectric constant values for 58 measurement points the ice thickness of the tested river section varied between 0 52 and 1 39 m and the dielectric constant values varied between 3 34 and 3 82 ice in the longdao wharf section was subject to juxtaposed thickening and thermodynamic ice growth the dielectric constant exhibited minimal fluctuation especially for the measurement points denoted by the dashed box in the figure the thickness of the ice cover fluctuated substantially between 0 4 and 1 4 m however the dielectric constant values remained largely unaltered indicating a minimal variation in the value of the dielectric constant for dense and pure solid ice formed via juxtaposed thickening and thermodynamic ice growth processes the plot of the dielectric constant value and average relative error see fig 13b shows that the error first decreased from 8 83 to 0 66 and then increased to 8 80 while the dielectric constant increased from 2 8 to 4 2 the minimum average relative error 0 66 was found for the measured dielectric constant value of 3 50 considering a theoretical value of 3 2 would increase the average relative error significantly to 4 49 therefore the gpr method offers a stronger measurement accuracy for ice formed thermodynamically or from juxtaposed thickening processes 3 3 test in the tuoketuo county section of the yellow river in 2017 two surveys were conducted in the tuoketuo county section of the yellow river between january 15 and 20 2017 with a total of 20 measurement points 40 17 45 63 n 111 3 1 61 e the date of the breakup was march 21 the measurements were conducted at a 180 bend as shown in fig 14 considering the high content of sediment in the yellow river its ice surface shows a distinct yellow color whereas the white part denotes snow on the surface a radar with a 1500 mhz antenna was used to measure the ice thickness of the yellow river under conditions of relatively high sediment content and the processed radar echo image clearly shows the bottom of the ice the tuoketuo county section has a unique 180 bend hence the ice cover was formed primarily through hydrodynamic processes after a series of processes e g collision crushing and breaking the ice from the upper reaches accumulated and froze to form stable ice thus the formation of the ice was highly randomized and its composition was complex the ice samples obtained from lines 1 and 2 are shown in fig 15 six of the ten ice samples contained significant sediment most ice samples exhibited columnar ice in the lower region and granular ice in the upper one only certain parts of the ice samples were pure ice these were structurally similar to the columnar ice samples taken from the heilong river see fig 15b and 15c the measured ice thicknesses and calculated dielectric constant values for the 20 measurement points are shown in fig 16 with ice thicknesses ranging from 0 44 to 0 64 m given the complexity of the ice composition the values of the dielectric constant at each measurement point varied considerably between 2 54 and 5 13 the minimum average relative error was 7 7 when the dielectric constant was set to 3 2 the above results indicate that the mixture of media has a sizeable influence on the accuracy of the gpr based ice thickness measurement 3 4 test from baotou city section to xinjian village section of the yellow river in 2019 between january 20 and 30 2019 dielectric constant measurements were taken in the upper reaches of the yellow river in a river course of approximately 700 km baotou city xinjian village with 17 measurement sections and 59 measurement points the date of the breakup was march 23 the ice conditions at the location of the measurement section and the radar echo images of typical measurement points are listed in table 1 to provide a reference for similar ice measurements using gpr as described earlier the 180 bend section had been surveyed in 2017 therefore the present survey investigated the straight section of the yellow river to study the dielectric constant of ice where ice was more widely distributed thereby offering more valuable data for hydrological monitoring in fact january is the freeze up period of the upper reaches of the yellow river except for the ice in the xishiwuqingdi village characterized by hydraulic thickening the rest of the measured sections primarily feature ice formed by juxtaposed thickening and thermodynamic processes the photographs of ice surfaces in table 1 indicate that the ice in all sections contained sediment ice from the xishiwuqingdi village jinqi village machangdi village and fumaoxi village sections were visibly brown or yellow in color with high sediment content the ice in the remaining sections had a lower sediment content and was similar to pure ice under the ice conditions shown in table 1 clear echo images were obtained using gpr with 1500 mhz antennas after image processing ice surface and ice bottom locations were easily obtained the dielectric constant and ice thickness values for each measurement point are shown in fig 17 a for the 59 measurement points the ice thickness ranged from 0 3 to 0 88 m and the corresponding dielectric constant values ranged from 2 72 to 3 78 these values were essentially consistent except for two measurement points where the dielectric constants deviated considerably when the dielectric constant was considered as 3 25 the average relative error of the 59 measurement points reached a minimum value of 1 34 see fig 17b 4 discussion 4 1 dielectric constant of ice in the heilong river and yellow river ice sample inspections and dielectric constant measurements clearly indicate that the ice of natural rivers comprises pure ice sediment air pure water and other media these substances are affected by factors such as air water temperature and river hydrodynamic processes thus their dielectric constants frequently deviate from the theoretical value to some extent comparing the 2015 2016 and 2017 dielectric constant tests of the heilong river dielectric constant values exhibited variations attributable to different ice morphologies for a theoretical pure ice dielectric constant value of 3 2 the errors in the gpr based ice thickness measurements were 7 42 2015 2016 and 4 49 2017 reasonable values of 3 65 and 3 50 were chosen for the dielectric constant reducing the average relative errors in the measurement to 4 88 and 0 66 respectively significantly improving the measurement accuracy comparing the 2017 and 2019 dielectric constant tests of the yellow river the accuracy of the gpr based ice thickness measurement at the river bend was poor owing to the complex composition of the mixture of ice in the yellow river however the measurement accuracy was more satisfactory when measuring the ice cover in the straight section of the river the dielectric constant of the ice for the yellow river was lower than that of the heilong river for the tuoketuo county section the minimum average relative error was 7 7 when the dielectric constant was set to 3 2 for the straight section the minimum average relative error was 1 34 when the dielectric constant was set to 3 25 both the temperature and voltage data obtained using the measuring rods indicate that only a very small amount of water remained inside the ice during the freeze up period but this amount increased significantly during the breakup period thus the gpr based ice thickness measurement should be carried out during the freeze up period according to the test results measured at 8 00 a m and 2 00p m the higher air temperature in the afternoon had no observable impact on the water content in the ice 4 2 sediment and air bubbles in the ice zhang et al 2021 conducted field observations and obtained 86 ice samples from the inner mongolia section of the yellow river between 2015 and 2020 after data analysis they concluded that the sediment content in the ice was 0 001 36 039 kg m3 granular ice contains 3 42 1 41 air bubbles while columnar ice contains 2 57 1 09 air bubbles li et al 2010 measured the content of air bubbles in ice formed via thermo hydrological processes in the hongqipao reservoir and found that the bubble content was less than 1 sediment and air bubbles in water are strongly influenced by hydrodynamics in rivers with strong water turbulence chunks of ice collide with each other and squeeze and scrape the riverbanks increasing their porosity and sediment content after freezing ice is likely to contain more air bubbles and sediment particles for rivers lakes and reservoirs with low flow turbulences ice is mostly formed via thermodynamic ice growth and tends to contain fewer air bubbles and less sediment another issue that requires attention is the state of sediment water can be adsorbed by sediment particles and wrap around their surfaces producing a sudden increase in the dielectric constant hence it is important to identify whether the sediment content in the ice is wet or dry to differentiate between the two we can refer to the research results of frozen soil frozen soil is a mixture of pure ice and sediment in similar compositions the difference is that frozen soil contains more sediment li et al 2007 used the e8362b pna microwave network analyzer by agilent and a high and low temperature test box to study the variation patterns of dielectric constants in soil samples at different temperatures and water volume fractions i e 5 10 15 20 25 and 30 they found that in the frequency range of 1 20 ghz the dielectric constant of frozen soil showed minimal variation when the soil temperature was lower than 0 c with frozen water around the sediment grains however a sudden increase in the dielectric constant of the soil sample was observed when the soil temperature exceeded 0 c i e when the ice in the soil changed to water song et al 2011 studied the variation patterns of dielectric constants at different temperatures for two silty clay samples with 31 44 and 36 73 water content similar findings were obtained when the soil temperature was below 0 c the dielectric constant of the soil samples was approximately 4 with minimal variations when the soil temperature exceeded 0 c the dielectric constant jumped to approximately 32 therefore over the freeze up period when the internal temperature of the ice was less than 0 c the sediment in the ice could be considered dry however during the breakup period the sediment could be considered wet 5 conclusions ice thickness is an important hydrological parameter of rivers in winter however calculations based upon ice dielectric constants tend to be inaccurate for natural rivers owing to the inhomogeneous composition of river ice after eight years of prototype monitoring in the heilong river and yellow river 158 measuring points were compared using the drill hole and gpr methods our findings show that for the heilong river the minimum average relative error was 0 66 for the ice surface formed via a juxtaposed thickening process with a dielectric constant of 3 5 whereas the error was 4 88 for an ice surface formed via abrupt thickening with a dielectric constant of 3 65 for the yellow river the minimum average relative error was 1 34 for an ice surface formed via juxtaposed thickening with a dielectric constant of 3 25 and it was 7 7 for an ice surface at the 180 bend with a dielectric constant of 3 2 according to the measured temperature and voltage distributions in the ice from the heilong river it is less likely that juxtaposed ice will contain water throughout the freeze up period however numerous water bodies may be present in the ice during the breakup period the proposed guidelines for performing gpr based measurements are as follows 1 adopting gpr for ice thickness measurements throughout the freeze up period is recommended as it can mitigate the influences of the most critical factors in measurement accuracy when the daily mean air temperature rises above 0 c it is regarded as the beginning of the breakup period 2 the straight section of the river and the smooth cover juxtaposed cover should be preferred over the curved section of the river and rough cover 3 before measurement the ice surface and impurities in the ice must be visually observed for a smooth cover juxtaposed cover similar to that shown in fig 11b the dielectric constant can be taken as 3 5 if sediments are observed similar to the case presented in table 1 the dielectric constant can be taken as 3 25 4 if the ice thickness of a sharp corner needs to be measured similar to that shown in fig 14a the dielectric constant can be taken as 3 2 however the measurement error may be approximately 8 or more to improve the measurement accuracy ice samples are needed to calibrate the dielectric constant 5 avoid measuring after snowfall or when the snow cover is thick snow hides the potholes present on the surface of ice which can be dangerous moreover thick snow cover reduces the measurement accuracy if the snow cover is similar to that shown in fig 7b the dielectric constant can be taken as 3 65 this study suffers from several limitations first the ice composition of natural rivers is complex for example snow cover can appear in various forms e g dry snow wet snow and even snow slush under different temperatures and solar radiation conditions second the interior of an ice jam or ice dam may incompletely freeze during winter therefore methods for improving the accuracy of ice thickness measurements using the gpr technique under such complex conditions still require further exploration in future research we hope our findings will improve the accuracy of ice thickness measurements in rivers and thereby improve the safety and livelihoods of people who live or work near similar river systems credit authorship contribution statement hui fu methodology writing original draft xinlei

2724,hydraulic tomography ht has been developed over the last two decades to image subsurface heterogeneity at high resolution that is critically important to robust solute transport predictions in this study ht based on two concepts i e geological zonation and geostatistical inversion models was utilized to characterize the k distribution of a laboratory sandbox aquifer at different parameter resolutions we compared the estimated k fields for predicting independent pumping tests and solute transport using the classical advection dispersion equation ade the impact of using geological zonation models of varying accuracy for ht analyses was investigated results revealed that when being calibrated to datasets from multiple pumping tests geological zonation models that faithfully represented the true stratigraphy predicted groundwater flow satisfactorily the deterministic k field of the calibrated reliable geological zonation models satisfactorily reproduced the preferential migration path of the observed tracer plume and the breakthrough curves btcs at sampling ports with further resolving the inter and intra layer heterogeneity the reconstructed k fields by ht better predicted both migrating plumes and btcs for two conservative tracer tests the estimated dispersivity values for ade only resulted in slight improvements in the fitting between observed and simulated solute tracer data it also demonstrated the need of integrating reliable geological information into the geostatistical inversion approach to reproduce geological structures in k fields our study suggested the proper consideration of geological zonation between boreholes during field implementation of ht to yield improved solute transport results keywords aquifer heterogeneity solute transport hydraulic tomography geological model dipole tracer test hydrodynamic dispersion longitudinal and transverse dispersivity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater flow and solute transport predictions in geological porous media have received persistent attention over the past several decades for the significant impacts on assessing groundwater contamination hazards design of effective remediation systems as well as on water supply and resource management issues abriola 1987 rudolph et al 1991 christiansen et al 2004 worthington et al 2012 maliva et al 2016 cho et al 2020 although porous media is widely acknowledged to be heterogeneous from pore to regional scales fiori 1998 dentz et al 2011 detailed mapping of spatial heterogeneity in hydrogeological parameters renders the accurate predictions of groundwater flow and contaminant migration as difficult tasks in complex subsurface environments kitanidis 2015 cirpka and valocchi 2016 ever since the mid 1980s extensive efforts have been invested to understand the controlling impacts of subsurface heterogeneity on solute transport one early landmark field experiment was conducted at the mildly heterogeneous canadian forces base borden site ontario mackay et al 1986 freyberg 1986 sudicky 1986 sudicky and illman 2011 where the vertically averaged chloride plume evolved into a relatively smooth bivariate gaussian shape over the first 647 days freyberg 1986 and sudicky 1986 successfully validated stochastic theories gelhar and axness 1983 dagan 1982 1984 in predicting the macroscopic behaviors of plume migration at the site and led to the recognition of the importance of heterogeneity in hydraulic conductivity k field for solute transport predictions later at the north bay site with a variance of ln k œÉ2 lnk of 1 79 sudicky et al 2010 demonstrated that the use of a three dimensional numerical model with statistically derived effective k and macrodispersivity calculated with theoretical models from gelhar and axness 1983 and input to standard forms of groundwater flow and advection dispersion ade equations resulted in reliable groundwater flow and solute transport predictions this study further demonstrated that the contaminant plume length was relatively insensitive to the value of longitudinal macrodispersivity at the more heterogeneous macrodispersion experiment made site œÉ2 lnk 4 5 by rehfeldt et al 1992 on the columbus air force base in mississippi united states zheng and jiao 1998 and feehley et al 2000 stated that solute transport simulations based on k fields interpolated from point measurements and the ade were inadequate to reproduce the asymmetric feature of the observed plumes which stimulated the use of alternative solute transport models such as the dual domain mass transfer model feehley et al 2000 harvey and gorelick 2000 the continuous time random walk approach berkowitz et al 2006 and the ade based on fractional derivatives lu et al 2002 zheng et al 2011 barlebo et al 2004 and hill et al 2006 contended that tritium migration at the made site could be explained by the ade based on a calibrated zonal groundwater model while molz et al 2006 asserted that to achieve such a conclusion an unrealistic k value had to be assigned to the zone located downstream of the tracer test regardless of the vigorous debates over the validity of ade in the groundwater research community accurate characterization of subsurface heterogeneity has been frequently proven to be one key issue in improving predictions of solute transport salamon et al 2007 zheng et al 2011 illman et al 2012 guo et al 2021 so far numerous studies have been published to understand the benefits of high resolution characterization of subsurface heterogeneity as well as the need in consideration of geological information for the reliable predictions of plume migration e g liu et al 2010 ronayne et al 2010 h√§ndel and dietrich 2012 foster et al 2021 under controlled conditions laboratory sandbox experiments have been conducted with prescribed heterogeneity patterns mimicking randomly distributed e g russell et al 1996 silliman et al 2001 levy and berkowitz 2003 fern√†ndez garcia et al 2004 or deterministically structured e g sudicky et al 1985 pedretti et al 2016 maina et al 2018 k fields to show the impacts of aquifer heterogeneity on solute migration and on the reproduction of btcs usually k values were experimentally determined e g permeameter or column tests for different types of sands and k fields were assumed to be zonally homogeneous for structured porous media aquifers e g barth et al 2001 danquigny et al 2004 trevisan et al 2017 although these laboratory studies provided useful insights on this topic perfect knowledge of site specific subsurface heterogeneity in the field is practically impossible to delineate with existing technology therefore alternative approaches have been proposed to obtain high resolution estimation of k distributions for laboratory or field investigations for example through a laboratory sandbox study pollock and cirpka 2012 obtained the cm scale k distribution by inverting electrical resistivity tomography data and hydraulic head measurements and successfully predicted the transient movement of a salt tracer plume in the field by explicitly representing the variability of k at submeter scale based on 2 495 flowmeter measurements salamon et al 2007 illustrated that the ade was capable of reproducing the anomalous spreading of the made 2 tracer plume dogan et al 2014 characterized the made site with 5 254 k measurements obtained by the direct push method at a vertical resolution of 1 5 cm their work demonstrated that with the adequate characterization of the k field the classical ade reasonably reproduced the observed plume of a tracer test in a recent study bianchi and zheng 2016 considered lithological data rather than extraordinarily high resolution measurements of k to generate geologically consistent realizations for the made site they showed that the non fickian solute transport behavior can be adequately simulated by a local ade based model during the last two decades hydraulic tomography ht has been developed as one robust approach for the high resolution mapping of spatial distribution of hydraulic parameters e g gottlieb and dietrich 1995 yeh and liu 2000 bohling et al 2002 liu et al 2002 brauchler et al 2003 zhu and yeh 2005 cardiff et al 2012 berg and illman 2011 hochstetler et al 2016 mao et al 2018 zhao and illman 2018 zha et al 2019 wang et al 2021 in the majority of published ht works k and or specific storage ss fields were reconstructed through inversion of pressure head data of multiple pumping tests the performance of reconstructed k and ss fields were usually evaluated for their abilities of predicting independent pumping tests yeh and liu 2000 cardiff et al 2013 and illman et al 2015 suggested significant information loss of the recovered k heterogeneity when pumping observation density was reduced beyond the geostatistical correlation lengths some ht studies have advocated the use of solute or heat tracers test data for the inverse modeling of k or transmissivity fields e g yeh and zhu 2007 zhu et al 2009 illman et al 2010a brauchler et al 2013 schwede et al 2014 lee and kitanidis 2014 somogyv√°ri and bayer 2017 vu and jardani 2022 while only a limited number of studies have attempted to validate the inverted high resolution k fields in their ability of predicting solute transport through a synthetic two dimensional aquifer ni et al 2009 showed the hydraulic tomography survey and the geostatistical inversion approach can be used to characterize flow and transport in heterogeneous aquifers they stated that the flow field based on the ht inverted k field can yield accurate predictions of btc peaks and phases without intensive experiments to calibrate accurate dispersivities at sites so far only several validation studies have been conducted through laboratory or field ht experiments for example illman et al 2010a presented laboratory experiments to examine the efficacy of hydraulic and partitioning tracer tomography for the purpose of imaging dnapl source zones through travel time based ht jim√©nez et al 2015 reconstructed the high resolution hydraulic parameters at the stegem√ºhle site g√∂ttingen lower saxony germany they concluded that comparison of model based predictions with tracer tests at the site revealed that the reliability of the derived aquifer model exhibited limitations in reproducing btcs through combining k field estimated from ht with the calibrated parameters for the dual domain transport model sanchez le√≥n et al 2016 presented a field study to show the improved prediction of the btcs at the extraction well for an independent tracer test illman et al 2012 demonstrated through sandbox experiments that the spatial distribution of k estimated by ht led to improved predictions of groundwater flow and solute transport in heterogeneous aquifers unlike the work by jim√©nez et al 2015 and sanchez le√≥n et al 2016 where the performances of reconstructed k fields in solute transport predictions were validated only using btcs illman et al 2012 also compared the simulated concentration distributions to photographs of migrating plumes during the tracer test which is of great use to assess the quality of the inversion results and to detect preferential flow paths in the k field so far laboratory and field studies are lacking in investigating the value of geological models calibrated to multiple pumping tests as well as the benefits of considering geological information in geostatistics based ht for the prediction of btcs and the migration of tracer plumes in this study we continued to evaluate the performance of high resolution k fields obtained by ht in predictions of tracer tests through laboratory sandbox experiments with additional purposes of 1 investigating the usefulness of geological information in improving the performance of the highly parameterized geostatistical model and 2 assessing the value of a solute transport model calibrated to tracer test data in improving predictions of solute transport with the reconstructed k fields by ht we first examine the performance of geological zonation models uncalibrated and calibrated of varying accuracy and geostatistical models in a multi layered laboratory sandbox with known stratigraphy in terms of predicting multiple pumping tests then based on the reconstructed k fields the classical ade was adopted to evaluate whether the tracer plume of one conservative tracer test could be reproduced or not for the controlled sandbox experiment next a second conservative tracer test was used to demonstrate the benefits of including calibrated transport parameters for the highly parameterized geostatistical models this study provides further insights in the joint use of geological data and ht for the improved predictions of solute transport in multi layered aquifer systems which is of particular importance because hydrogeologists and practitioners can easily rely on a single geological model and in situ estimates of hydraulic parameters to guide remediation plans at contaminant sites 2 laboratory sandbox data the synthetic heterogeneous aquifer was constructed in a vertical laboratory sandbox by illman et al 2010b through cyclically depositing sands of various sizes to create an interfingering fluvial structure the sandbox is 193 0 cm in length 82 6 cm in height and 10 2 cm in width forty eight fully penetrating horizontal wells along six columns were installed on the back wall of the sandbox for pumping injection or monitoring purposes fig 1 is the front view of the synthetic aquifer showing the layout of the deposits with numbers indicating layers and ports the sandbox aquifer was initially characterized through permeameter analyses of core samples single hole pumping tests and constant rate pumping tests by illman et al 2010b during which constant head boundaries were simultaneously maintained at the top left and right sides of the sandbox aquifer and the front back and bottom faces were set as no flow then illman et al 2012 conducted a series of dipole hydraulic and tracer experiments with setting all faces around the synthetic aquifer as no flow boundaries specifically 16 dipole tests were conducted by pumping from one port and injecting the pumped water at another port at an average injection pumping rate of 480 ml min to maintain water mass balance eight tests i e e2 i47 e for extraction and i for injection 2 and 47 for port numbers e42 i7 e4 i45 e15 i34 e24 i25 e17 i32 e23 i26 and e20 i29 were chosen for model calibration see fig 1 for port locations the other eight tests i e e8 i41 e9 i40 e10 i39 e11 i38 e12 i37 e16 i33 e18 i31 and e30 i19 were kept for model validation purposes for each dipole test pressure head changes were monitored at all 48 ports with 0 to 1 psig pounds per square inch gauge setra model 209 pressure transducers pumping and injection continued until the development of steady state flow conditions which were determined from the stabilized head measurements then two dipole tracer tests were conducted by injecting bromide solution as the conservative tracer for conservative tracer test 1 ctt1 water was injected at port 42 with a flow rate of 372 4 ml min to achieve water mass balance the pumping rate at port 7 was kept at 304 ml min and a cumulative rate of 68 4 ml min was set for other 12 sampling lines at different locations ports 2 10 12 14 19 22 27 30 35 37 39 and 47 after the flow field reached steady state conditions a valve in the injection line of port 42 was switched from water to a bromide fisher scientific pittsburgh pennsylvania solution with an average concentration of 151 3 mg l the tracer solution contained 70 ml of blue food coloring tone s food coloring to enable the visual observation of the tracer plume evolution through the frontal glass of the sandbox after 10 min injection of the tracer solution the injection line at port 42 was switched back to clean water the water sampling campaign at extraction port 7 and the other 12 sampling locations was continued for a period of 5 h to record the migration of the bromide tracer in the sandbox aquifer a total of 780 samples were collected with an average of 60 samples for each of the 12 sampling lines and at port 7 for the conservative tracer test 2 ctt2 the tracer solution was injected at port 37 while water was extracted at port 12 and 634 samples were collected from 11 sampling lines ports 7 9 12 17 21 24 25 28 32 40 and 42 during both tracer tests photographs of the sandbox were taken at various times to show the plume migrations upon completion of the experiment bromide concentrations were determined using an ion chromatograph ic dionex ics 2000 dionex sunnyvale california at the university of waterloo 3 models used for k field characterizations 3 1 geological zonation models to evaluate the usefulness of geological information on groundwater flow and transport three geological models of varying accuracy were constructed for the sandbox aquifer the first geological model was built based on the stratigraphy information shown on the frontal glass fig 1 unlike geological models usually constructed through interpolating stratigraphy information from borehole logs luo et al 2017 or estimating stratigraphy from geophysical approaches dogan et al 2011 this geological model assumed the perfect knowledge of aquifer stratification thus representing the best case scenario and named as geo perfect during the construction of the 18 layer sandbox aquifer commercial sands of varying grain sizes were used to create different layers by illman et al 2010b with layers 5 and 6 consisting of mixed types of sands of different sizes these two layers showed strong sub layering behaviors during partitioning tracer tests by illman and yeh 2011 we therefore defined sub layers 5 sub and 6 sub to more faithfully represent the geological zonation information the second geological model was constructed to represent the scenario that geological stratigraphy of the 18 layer aquifer was assumed to be known along the six columns of wells in fig 1 mimicking the accurate knowledge of stratigraphy along boreholes in the field the stratigraphy of this geological model was interpolated using the software leapfrog hydro aranz geo limited 2015 which utilizes the fast radial basis function method to implement dual kriging to interpolate stratigraphy information between well columns compared to the accurate stratigraphy shown in fig s1a see supplementary information si section the second geological model in fig s1b showed some obvious differences in the geometries of different layers due to the interpolation between well columns especially at the outside area along boundaries thus named as geo good for the construction of the third geological model in fig s1c systematic errors were added to the thicknesses of layering information along the six columns of wells leading to the obvious deterioration of the interpolated stratigraphy compared to the actual stratigraphy shown in the sandbox fig s1a both the width and thickness of the interpolated stratigraphy were varied especially for the layers in the central part of the sandbox this geological model was named as geo poor five cases cases 1a 1b 1c 1d and 1e were compared to investigate the performances of geological zonation models of different accuracy and through assigning each geological unit with k values estimated from different techniques in cases 1a and 1b we utilized the geo perfect model and k measurements determined from two conventional site characterization approaches namely constant head permeameter tests and single hole pumping tests illman et al 2010b the constant head permeameter tests were conducted on core samples extracted at 48 port locations single hole pumping tests were performed at 48 port locations to estimate k values table 1 summarizes the sand types and k estimates for each unit of the sandbox aquifer for the unit intersected by multiple ports a geometric mean value of k measurements was provided in cases 1c 1d and 1e k values were estimated through simultaneously calibrating the geo perfect geo good and geo poor models respectively to the eight dipole tests described in section 2 1 3 2 geostatistical inversion models in order to characterize the k field of the heterogeneous sandbox at a higher parameter resolution we performed geostatistical inverse analyses of eight dipole tests using the simultaneous successive linear estimator simsle code xiang et al 2009 the geostatistical inversion approach implemented in simsle treats the lnk values of the heterogeneous porous media as stochastic processes with given prior information such as the unconditional means variances œÉ2 ln k and correlation scales Œªx Œªy and Œªz simsle creates the initial conditional mean parameter field through conditioning on available measurements of hydraulic parameters and observed head with cokriging the uncertainty of the initially conditioned effective parameter field was represented by the residual variance of each parameter at every material block the parameter field is then used to solve groundwater flow equations to obtain simulated pressure heads based on the differences between simulated and observed pressure heads simsle iteratively improves the estimated hydraulic parameters as well as the associated residual variance until the differences between the two continuous estimated hydraulic parameter fields or the largest difference between simulated and observed heads is smaller than a specified tolerance we assumed that the hydraulic parameter fields can be described by the exponential covariance model four cases were considered with differences in the initial values for k case 2a as 8 0 10 2 cm s cases 2b 2c and 2d the estimated k fields from cases 1c 1d and 1e respectively while œÉ2 ln k 3 0 Œªx 50 0 cm Œªy 10 2 cm and Œªz 10 0 cm to be consistent with a previous study zhao et al 2016 4 results 4 1 model calibration to simulate groundwater flow for both forward and inverse modeling of geological zonation and geostatistical approaches the synthetic sandbox aquifer was discretized into 11 826 elements and 24 124 nodes with an average element dimension of 1 0 cm 1 0 cm 10 2 cm such a fine computational grid was reported to be suitable for solute transport simulations in the synthetic sandbox aquifer by illman et al 2012 while maintaining a reasonable computational cost after mapping the 48 pumping injection and observation ports onto the simulation grid steady state groundwater flow simulations of the eight dipole tests needed by model calibration were conducted using the finite element code mmoc3 yeh et al 1993 which can simulate groundwater flow and solute transport under fully and variably saturated conditions all six faces of the sandbox were set as no flow boundaries during forward simulations of dipole pumping injection tests for the calibration of three geological zonation models introduced in section 3 1 pixel by pixel information regarding the geological layers was transferred from leapfrog hydro to the computational grid in mmoc3 zonal homogeneity and isotropy were assumed for each layer of three geological models to capture the interlayer heterogeneity of k fields in each of three geological models 18 parameters of k were estimated through coupling the forward simulation code mmoc3 yeh et al 1993 and parameter estimation code pest doherty 2015 for the sub layers 5 sub and 6 sub in the geo perfect model k values were kept same as the estimate for layer 14 due to the use of f75 sand as fine sand material for the mixed components estimation of k values for the geological zonation models cases 1c 1d and 1e were performed by minimizing the objective function that represented a weighted sum of squared differences between observed pressure heads and those simulated by mmoc3 yeh et al 1993 model parameters were iteratively optimized by pest doherty 2015 based on the derivatives of all 368 observed heads from eight dipole tests with respect to 18 adjustable parameters calibration runs of geological models were performed on a pc with a quad core cpu with 24 gb of ram the optimization process converged when the lowest four objective function values were within a relative distance of 0 05 for the highly parameterized geostatistical inversion models based on simsle calibration runs were performed on a pc with a 12 core cpu and 256 gb of ram unlike the calibration of geological zonation models where estimated k fields were constrained by the stratigraphy of varying accuracy pixel by pixel correlation relationships between k and observed pressure heads from dipole tests were explored to reflect the incorporation of head data we selected inversion results from the iteration step at which the mean square error l2 norms have stabilized which indicated the convergence of the inverse estimation process xiang et al 2009 the quality of matches between simulated and observed drawdowns after model calibrations was assessed through scatterplots and the best fit lines and coefficient of determination r2 the mean absolute error l1 and l2 were calculated for each dipole test to further evaluate the fits between observed and simulated drawdowns the l2 norm magnifies large discrepancies and allows one to better assess the different models those quantities were computed as 1 l 1 1 n i 1 n œá i œá i 2 l 2 1 n i 1 n œá i œá i 2 where n is the total number of drawdown data i indicates the data number œá and œá i represent the simulated and measured drawdowns respectively fig 2 shows the calibration scatterplots of the geological models and geostatistical inversion models on each subplot we provided the corresponding linear model fit a 45 degree line and r2 value in all seven cases the observed drawdowns were well fitted by model calibration processes with r2 values varying from 0 952 to 0 997 the calibration results of geological models fig 2a to c were worse than those of geostatistical inversion cases fig 2d to g the main reason is that the highly parameterized geostatistical model has a larger degree of freedom to adjust the unknown k values than the zonation based geological models 4 2 comparison of different k fields fig 3 shows the contour plots of k fields for two uncalibrated geological models populated with k estimates from the permeameter test fig 3a and single hole test fig 3b and three geological models calibrated to eight dipole tests fig 3c to e fig 3f g h and i are k fields estimated by ht starting with uniform prior mean and with heterogeneous k means from case 1c case 1d and case 1e the estimated k values for cases 1c 1d and 1e are listed in tables 1 and 2 examination of fig 3a and c reveals that the distribution patterns of high and low k zones are quite different among the uncalibrated and calibrated geo perfect geological models with the estimated k field in fig 3c showing obviously more heterogeneous features than k fields using estimates from the permeameter and single hole tests with using less accurate geological layering information the calibrated geo good model in fig 3d shows an overall high and low k pattern similar to the fig 3c while k values are different between two calibrated geological models through comparing the pixel by pixel distribution of different layers 83 73 of the 12 636 elements in the geo good model matched with the elements in the geo perfect model for the geo poor model due to the use of incorrect layering information along the six columns of wells only 60 73 of elements in the geo poor model matched with the elements in the geo perfect model the estimated k field for the geo poor model in fig 3e obviously shows a different heterogeneous pattern to those of the geo perfect and geo good models in terms of the shape and locations of the high k zones the estimated k field by ht analysis in case 2a shares some similar distribution pattern as case 1c although the positions and shapes of high and low k zones in fig 3f are not strictly consistent when being compared to those in fig 3c for the geostatistical inversion cases 2b 2c and 2d after using k values of the calibrated geological models fig 3c d and e as the initial means for the geostatistical inversion approach the estimated k tomograms in fig 3g to i show both the inter and intra layer variability 4 3 prediction of independent dipole pumping tests we next evaluated the reconstructed k fields through comparing their performances in simulating eight additional dipole tests not used in the calibration effort fig 4 shows the scatterplots of observed versus simulated drawdowns examination of fig 4a and b reveals that the geological zonation models populated with k values from either permeameter or single hole tests produce biased predictions of drawdowns while performances of the former are better that the latter in terms of l1 and l2 norms when the k values estimated from model calibration were used the geological zonation model predicted drawdowns of eight pumping tests quite well with r2 increased to 0 968 and significantly lowered l1 and l2 norms fig 4c compared to fig 4c the calibrated geo good and geo poor models performed worse for the drawdown predictions of eight dipole tests in terms of l1 and l2 norms as shown in fig 4d and e still both geological models performed better than the two uncalibrated geological models shown in fig 4a and b these results suggest that k estimates obtained from the calibrations of the geological zonation models to multiple pumping tests can better represent the heterogeneous k features of the sandbox aquifer than those k estimates based on permeameter and single hole tests we also noted that the geostatistical inversion model case 2a yielded improved drawdown predictions comparing to cases 1a and 1b while the linear fit metrics r2 l1 and l2 of case 2a were slightly worse than those of case 1c the geostatistical inversion models in cases 2b 2c and 2d using the calibrated geological models as prior k means all performed better than the case 2a in predictions of eight dipole tests as shown in fig 4g and h the geostatistical inversion cases using k fields from the calibrated geo perfect and geo good models performed similarly well for drawdown predictions in terms of r2 l1 and l2 the performance of the geostatistical inversion case using k field from the calibrated geo poor model showed slightly worse l1 and l2 metrics than those in fig 4g and h these findings together with the k tomograms shown in fig 3f to i reveal that structural features introduced into k fields by the geostatistical inversion approach can be helpful for the predictions of pumping tests used for model validations 4 4 simulation of the e7 i42 dipole tracer test 4 4 1 migration behavior of tracer plume to further evaluate the solute transport prediction performances of different geological models and geostatistical models we simulated the migration of the bromide plume during the e7 i42 dipole tracer test using the groundwater flow and solute transport modeling code mmoc3 yeh et al 1993 the conservative solute transport in the saturated porous media was modeled with the classical ade the longitudinal Œ±l and transverse Œ±t dispersivities were set as zero and the effective porosity was set to be 0 36 for all cases in later sections Œ±l and Œ±t values obtained from model calibrations to tracer test will be utilized and discussed fig 5 and fig s2 show the tracer plume observed from the front glass of the sandbox and relative concentration distributions simulated by different modeling cases snapshots of concentration distributions at four time periods were selected for visual comparisons at t 12 min fig 5 a two minutes after removing the tracer injection source the blue color plume distributed as a snail shape with a preferential migration path developing along layer 4 below injection port 42 examination of fig 5 reveals that 1 geological zonation model geo perfect populated with in situ k estimates from permeameter or single hole tests predicted the general locations of the plume but failed to capture the preferential migration paths 2 the geo perfect geological model calibrated to ht datasets provided obviously improved predictions of the plume with the lateral fingering features being vividly reproduced at the lower portion of the plume and 3 the migrating plumes predicted by the calibrated geo good and geo poor geological models were similar to the one by the geo perfect model while the shape and spatial distribution of the high concentration zones e g c c0 0 95 among three cases were different when using a homogeneous prior mean 8 0 10 2 m s for k estimation the geostatistical model case 2a also predicted the overall shape of the tracer plume fig 5 while the fingering features were not as accurately captured as shown in the observed plume when using the calibrated geological models geo perfect and geo good as prior mean k for cases 2b and 2c the geostatistical inversion cases produced tracer plumes similar to cases 1c and 1d with only slight differences visible from the shape as well as the connectivity of the upper and lower high c c0 zones when using the calibrated geological model geo poor as the prior mean k in case 2d more differences become apparent between the tracer plumes in case 1e and those predicted by the geostatistical inversion case 2d in fig 5 at t 27 min fig 5b the blue color plume migrated both laterally and vertically lateral transport was rapid and mostly noticeable along layer 4 near the bottom boundary of the sandbox while vertical migration was constrained by the relatively low k layer near the top of the plume simulated distributions by five geological models revealed quite different lateral migration patterns with the preferential transport path distributed in the upper middle and lower middle areas of the sandbox for cases 1c 1d and 1e in fig 5b respectively while the simulated tracer distributions of cases 1a and 1b showed no distinctive preferential migration paths four geostatistical modeling cases reproduced the observed preferential transport features while the shapes of high c c0 zones were different among cases 2a 2b 2c and 2d specifically the geostatistical inversion case 2a produced two preferential paths due to the existence of high k zones in the middle and lower part of the reconstructed k tomogram in fig 3f the fingering of the tracer plume was more obvious at the lower preferential flow path by further using k values from calibrated the geo perfect and geo good models as prior mean k fields the fingering of predicted tracer plumes was less profound for both cases 2b and 2c in fig 5b when the k field estimated by the calibration of geo poor model was used as prior distribution the geostatistical inversion case 2d generated a plume shape that was quite different from case 1e in terms of fingering locations suggesting the impact of geostatistical calibration process on the prior k field estimated by case 1e at t 100 min fig s2a preferential transport along high k layers had been routed toward the extraction port 7 and the observed plume was diluted the outer boundary of blue colored area also became diluted appearing blurred visually at t 175 min fig s2b the tracer solution was diluted by the injected clean water resulting in the dye being only faintly visible at both time points tracer plumes simulated by cases 1c 2d showed similar features in terms of the covered areas although there were some differences in areas along boundaries fig s2 more distinctive differences could be observed when comparing the diluted regions inside simulated plumes showing the flushing of the tracer in the synthetic aquifer with clean water we next evaluate different models more quantitatively through comparing the predicted versus observed breakthrough curves and scatterplots of simulated versus observed c c0 in following sections 4 4 2 prediction of breakthrough curves at point sampling ports fig 6 shows the observed and simulated breakthrough curves at 13 sampling locations ports 2 7 10 12 14 19 27 22 30 35 37 39 and 47 for five geological modeling cases the matches of the breakthrough curves at port 35 were quite consistent for all cases as shown in fig 6 while matches of simulated breakthrough curves to observation data showed distinctive differences for the other ports we observed that geological zonation models relying on point measurements of k from permeameter and single hole tests cases 1a and 1b predicted either the early or late arrivals of tracers at most sampled ports in contrast the calibrated geo perfect model case 1c showed clear improvements of matches between the simulated and observed btcs for the geo good model in case 1d the predicted btcs were close to those of the case 1c with the largest difference shown for the btc at port 27 as the geological model became less accurate the geo poor model case 1e showed mismatches at more ports between the simulated and observed btcs in fig 6 these results highlight the benefits of using calibrated k values instead of measurements from permeameter or single hole tests to better represent k heterogeneity in the zonal mean sense for the four geostatistical inversion modeling cases fig 7 simsle using a homogeneous prior mean predicted the breakthrough curves well except the mismatches at five ports ports 2 7 22 27 and 37 in case 2b the matches of simulated btcs were quite similar to those from case 1c with only slight mismatch at port 22 the geostatistical inversion case 2c predicted the observed btcs well at nearly all ports except port 27 when the k field estimated by the calibration of geo poor model was used as prior distribution the geostatistical inversion case 2d produced obviously poor matches of btcs at ports 12 22 27 and 39 suggesting the importance in using accurate structural information for the prediction of solute transport at a fine scale the solute transport prediction results were then evaluated by directly comparing the simulated versus observed relative concentrations at all 13 sampling ports as shown in fig 8 to improve the discrimination of results we computed the bivariate kernel density scott 1992 silverman1986 carr 2003 at each data point for the scatterplots of different cases the kernel density estimator implemented in the scikit learn library in python was utilized and the default setting of gaussian kernel function was adopted for the estimator pedregosa et al 2011 a high kernel density value suggests data points are more intensely distributed around certain data points silverman1986 king et al 2016 and vice versa for the convenience of using a consistent color bar the maximum density value in each subplot of figs 8 and 11 was scaled to unity we also colored the letters of linear fit results l1 and l2 norms to increase the readability of figures examination of fig 8 reveals that prediction results of cases 1a and 1b were worse than the other cases the fitting metrics r2 l1 and l2 of the geo perfect model cases 1c calibrated to ht test data improved markedly which were better than the highly parameterized geostatistical inversion model case 2a we see in fig 8 that the data points with high kernel density values more consistently distributed along the 45 degree line in fig 8c and g than those in other subfigures this makes sense since the inter layer heterogeneity feature played a dominant role in plume migration as shown in fig 4a the geostatistical inversion case 2b yielded the best simulation results in terms of r2 and l1 among all five models the geostatistical inversion case 2c using k values from calibrated geo good as prior k field yielded the second best simulation results while using k values from calibrated geo poor model as prior k field yielded poorer results in terms of r2 and l2 we reiterate here that the differences among three geological models geo perfect geo good and geo poor are due to the amount and accuracy of geological information used to build the geological layers as expected we see the clearly reduced performances in predicting independent dipole pumping tests and relative tracer concentrations from the geo perfect model to the geo poor model more importantly when the site geology was poorly represented the geo poor model was less reliable in predicting the tracer concentrations than drawdown predictions at the same locations based on results shown in figs 4 and 8 one advantage of the geological zonation model lies in its low complexity which can be justified sufficiently well by a relatively less amount of calibration data than high resolution models sch√∂niger et al 2015 these results revealed that the heterogeneity of k would strongly affect the migration and removal of solutes which highlighted again the need in accurately imaging the three dimensional geometry of layers between boreholes 5 discussion 5 1 value of the calibrated transport model parameters for predictions of dipole tracer tests in the above sections the longitudinal and transverse dispersivities Œ±l and Œ±t were assumed to be zero in the ade thus neglecting the impact of mechanical dispersion processes on the simulated tracer plume and btcs to examine this issue Œ±l and Œ±t were treated as homogeneous and estimated through coupling the model independent parameter estimation code pest doherty 2015 and the groundwater flow and solute transport modeling code mmoc3 yeh et al 1993 to fit the 13 observed btcs of the e7 i42 test previous laboratory experiments and field studies have suggested that the solute dispersion process was scale dependent gelhar et al 1992 sudicky et al 1983 vishal and leung 2015 and the value of Œ±t was frequently assumed to be 10 of Œ±l zhang and gable 2008 pollock and cirpka 2012 sanchez le√≥n et al 2016 other studies also reported that such a ratio could vary for different experimental settings kim et al 2004 zech et al 2019 therefore for the current study Œ±l and Œ±t were treated as independent and inversely estimated for cases 1c 1d 2a 2b and 2c while cases 1a 1b 1e and 2i were excluded for their obviously poor prediction performances shown in figs 5 6 7 and 8 the calibration results of tracer test data were plotted in fig 9 and estimated Œ±l and Œ±t values were provided in each subplot generally there were consistent improvements in the linear fits between the simulated and observed c c0 in terms l2 norms among the five cases while the r2 and l1 norms showed no such consistency when comparing fig 9 to fig 8 this was expected as the sum of mean square errors between observed and simulated c c0 was used as objective functions during parameter estimation processes the calibrated dispersivity values varied from 3 70e 4 to 1 54e 1 cm and from 4 54e 3 to 8 68e 1 cm for Œ±l and Œ±t respectively these estimated values of Œ±l and Œ±t were close to the values reported for laboratory porous medium with similar grain size of 0 25 1 25 mm klenk and grathwohl 2002 rolle et al 2009 ballarini et al 2012 as the same tracer test data were used for parameter estimations differences in the estimated dispersivity values could be attributed to different k fields used among cases 1c 1d 2a 2b and 2c compared to the geological zonation modeling cases cases 1c and 1d where k values were treated as layer wise homogeneous fig 3c and d intra layer heterogeneity was additionally resolved for the k fields in fig 3g and h by the geostatistical inversion processes cases 2b and 2c such additional details to k fields on one hand led to the improved predictions of btcs in figs 6 and 7 and improved match of observed and simulated c c0 in fig 8 on the other hand led to smaller values of Œ±l and Œ±t estimated for cases 2b and 2c these results suggested that when k heterogeneity was better resolved smaller dispersivity values representing pore or local scale dispersion processes were tended to be obtained through the inverse modeling approach this is in line with the previous finding by liu et al 2010 that the dispersivity values decreased in solute transport models when heterogeneity of k was considered to further validate the estimated k fields and Œ±l and Œ±t values through calibrating groundwater flow model and solute transport model to eight dipole tests and the e7 i42 dipole tracer test another conservative dipole tracer test e12 i37 was simulated and the results were compared to the observed tracer plume as well as btcs at 11 sampling ports fig 10 shows the observed plume at three different stages early 6 min middle 25 min and late 151 min and relative concentration distributions simulated by cases 2a 2b and 2c using the reconstructed k fields and estimated Œ±l and Œ±t values from the ctt1 test at time t 6 min the tracer plume was confined within a flat zone as shown in fig 10a the simsle inversion case 2a starting with homogeneous prior mean over predicted the thickness of the plume in the vertical direction while cases 2b and 2c reproduced the plume significantly better in terms of the overall shape as well as the lateral fingering as the plume gradually migrated toward the extraction port 12 located at the top right of the sandbox aquifer case 2a only reproduced the overall trend of the plume at t 25 min while cases 2b and 2c also showed more details in the concentration distributions at finer scales at late time t 151 min the tracer plume became diluted and only the general pattern was outlined in fig 10a cases 2a 2b and 2c showed similar distribution patterns in fig 10b c and d we next compared the predicted and observed tracer data and btcs for the ctt2 dipole tracer test in figs 11 and 12 for cases 2a 2b and 2c the Œ±l and Œ±t values in ade were assumed to be zero for fig 11a b and c while those values were adopted from the calibration of the ctt1 dipole tracer test in fig 11d e and f we see in fig 11 that data points with high kernel density values distributed along the 45 degree line more consistently for case 2b in fig 11b and e than those in the other two cases the scatterplots in fig 11 and btcs in fig 12 showed that adopting the calibrated Œ±l and Œ±t values for ade only resulted in slight improvements in the fitting of observed and simulated c c0 for case 2a such impacts on the results of cases 2b and 2c were negligible here we acknowledge that the effects of numerical dispersion on solute transport simulations by mmoc3 yeh et al 1993 could be one potential factor affecting the values of calibrated Œ±l and Œ±t in figs 9 and 11 that is even by assuming Œ±l and Œ±t to be zero in the ade the mixing effect during solute transport simulations by mmoc3 yeh et al 1993 results in the spatial averaging of simulated concentrations over the finite element grid su et al 2020 thus tends to yield underestimated dispersivity values during the calibration of observed btcs from ctt1 tracer test mehl and hill 2001 maina et al 2018 although the influence of numerical dispersion can be reduced by using a finer grid and smaller time steps rubin et al 1997 konikow 2011 the observed btcs in figs 6 and 12 show no obvious abrupt changes suggesting the controlling influence from both advection and mechanical dispersion on tracer migration during the dipole tracer tests 5 2 impacts of incorporating geological information into ht for improved predictions of solute tracer transport studies over the last several decades suggested that satisfactory solute transport models would always require significant efforts in dealing with subsurface heterogeneity konikow 2011 zheng et al 2011 sudicky and illman 2011 in our laboratory study k fields were reconstructed through conceptualizing the sandbox aquifer as geological zonation and geostatistical models when being calibrated to multiple dipole test datasets for ht analysis it is interesting to see in figs 5 to 7 that the geological models of varying accuracy yielded improved predictions of tracer plume evolutions and improved fittings between the simulated and observed btcs over those based on the geo perfect geological model and k estimates from permeameter tests or single hole tests therefore aside from those numerous field efforts in characterizing the k heterogeneity through extensive sampling of cores results of our study highlighted the value of calibration of geological models in capturing the overall heterogeneous pattern of the k field while fine scale k estimates may be obtained through high resolution characterization techniques such as direct push techniques dogan et al 2014 obtaining reliable k estimates between boreholes including its connectivity appears to be one of the key ingredients in accurate solute transport predictions for field studies caution should be paid to construct accurate geological models in this regard the combined use of ground penetrating radar gpr and direct push hydraulic profiling dphp have shown to provide high resolution estimates of the three dimensional geometry of hydrostratigraphic zones dogan et al 2011 mccall et al 2017 zhao and illman 2022a b meanwhile the issue of data resolution would also affect performances of the calibrated geological and geostatistical models in terms of predicting independent pumping tests as noted by previous studies e g cardiff et al 2013 illman et al 2015 zhao et al 2016 here we further investigated the effects of observation data density on the calibration of the geo good model and subsequent performances in predicting pumping tests and tracer tests instead of using eight dipole pumping tests and 48 observation ports one more scenario using four dipole pumping tests and 24 observation ports were selected for the model calibration the calibrated k values were listed in table s1 compared to the k field in fig 3d the contour plot of k field in fig 13 a shows a similar overall distribution pattern of high and low k value zones while differences could be identified due to the use of reduced number of pressure head data for model calibration we also see the degraded performance in prediction of independent dipole pumping tests and the ctt1 dipole tracer test when comparing fig 13b and d to fig 4d and fig 8d respectively still the geo good model calibrated to reduced number of observation data performed better in predicting independent pumping tests and the ctt1 tracer test than the geo poor model fig 4e and fig 8e calibrated to data obtained from eight dipole pumping tests and 48 observation ports the simulated tracer plume by the geo good model in fig 13c at time 27 min is also similar to the plume in fig 5b while the shape of high concentration zones e g c c0 0 65 are visually different in the lateral fingering of the simulated migrating plume these results again highlighted the priority of collecting accurate geology data when being utilized for the construction of geology based groundwater models another important finding from this study is that compared to obtaining dispersivity values for the ade through inverse calibration to tracer test data accurate reconstruction of the inter and intra layer heterogeneity of k field through incorporating reliable geological data into the geostatistical inversion approach better predicted both the spatial distribution of the migrating plumes and btcs for two conservative tracer tests evidence from previous field studies suggested that the classical ade approach suffered from the inability to account for fine scale heterogeneity and therefore sufficiently detailed mapping of k was needed to reproduce the observed plume behaviors in heterogeneous aquifers e g feehley et al 2000 konikow 2011 dogan et al 2014 even if many spatially discretized k values could be obtained from in situ and ex situ approaches possible measurement errors uncertainty in spatial interpolation methods as well as variations in regional flow conditions during solute transport simulations in the field would still render the accurate predictions of tracer plumes to be difficult yeh et al 1995 su et al 2020 although the importance of accurately reconstructing k fields with inter and intra layer variation features has been well documented by studies over the last decades e g gelhar et al 1979 abriola 1987 harvey and gorelick 2000 kitanidis 2015 our sandbox experiment results shown in figs 3 to 8 delineated the practical difficulties of using k data obtained by permeameter case 1a and single hole case 1b tests with even the perfect stratigraphy information for the accurate groundwater flow and solute transport simulations for the current study k values in cases 1c 1d and 1e were obtained through calibrating geological models simultaneously to multiple pumping tests to account for the scenario dependent problem during model calibration huang et al 2011 yeh et al 2015 the calibrated geological models assuming zonal homogeneity yielded k fields that produced better drawdown and tracer concentration predictions than the uncalibrated geological models cases 1a and 1b one possible reason for the relative better performance of calibrated geo perfect and geo good geological models is that the sandbox was constructed with sands of various sizes lacking of low permeable layers or sub layers with fine silts and clayey materials for multi aquifer aquitard systems with high heterogeneity such as the north campus research site k 5 75 10 10 4 28 10 3 m s œÉ2 lnk 7 3 by permeameter test in waterloo canada alexander et al 2011 zhao and illman 2022a the performance of geological models assuming zonal homogeneity may be less satisfactory for solute transport predictions due to neglecting the fine scale k variations to resolve the inter and intra layer heterogeneity of k fields we integrated geological information of different accuracy into geostatistical inversion models results of cases 2b and 2c based on the geostatistics based approach more accurately predicted plume migration at the fine scale figs 5 s2 and 10 as well as the matches between simulated and observed btcs in figs 7 and 12 still successful prediction of btcs at all discrete sampling points is a challenging task our laboratory sandbox study clearly showed promising results in improved prediction of solute tracer tests through high resolution characterization of aquifer heterogeneity by ht with the joint use of accurate geological information 6 summary and conclusions in this study we investigated and compared the performances of geological zonation and geostatistical inversion models in predicting conservative solute transport when multiple pumping tests were used to calibrate both models based on the reconstructed k fields the classical ade was adopted to evaluate whether the tracer plume evolution and breakthrough curves could be reproduced or not for the controlled sandbox experiments in addition the value of a calibrated transport model and accurate geological information for predictions of dipole tracer tests were examined with two conservative dipole tracer tests our work resulted in the following major findings and conclusions 1 the estimated k distribution through calibration of the perfect geological model to multiple dipole tests showed heterogeneous patterns of high and low k zones that are obviously different from k fields using estimates of the permeameter tests and single hole tests it is important to note that such perfect geological models are impossible to obtain with current technology incorporating the calibrated geological model as prior k mean field for the geostatistical inversion approach revealed both the inter and intra layer heterogeneity for the sandbox aquifer 2 the correct identification of detailed layering structures in k field by calibrating reliable geological models yielded more accurate predictions of the independent dipole pumping tests and more importantly reproduced the preferential migration paths more vividly compared to the geological zonation models assigned with k values from permeameter and single hole tests this suggests that fine scale characterization of k heterogeneity along boreholes with different characterization approaches yield useful information but they are not sufficient in accurately predicting solute transport the improved prediction of solute transport by the calibrated geological zonation model assumed the perfect knowledge of aquifer stratification was also better than the highly parameterized geostatistical inversion model geostatistical inversion model starting from the calibrated accurate geological model performed satisfactorily in predicting the drawdowns of independent tests and tracer concentration measurements of solute tracer tests 3 in order to benefit site characterization and simulation of solute transport in heterogeneous media the geological zonation model has to be reconstructed as accurate as possible poor characterization and representation of site geology produces more deterioration to simulation results of tracer transport than prediction of pumping tests even when the geological information could be reliably obtained our results revealed that the geostatistical inversion approach which can integrate multiple types of observation data is suggested in order to improve the performances of groundwater flow and transport models this in turn should significantly improve remediation performance and accelerate cleanup time resulting in substantial cost savings we concur that further treating the dispersivity values as spatially heterogeneous fields during the geostatistical inverse modeling approach nowak and cirpka 2006 or joint inversion of hydraulic head data and tracer test data to better resolve the fine scale heterogeneity of k zhu et al 2009 lee and kitanidis 2014 should also improve solute transport predictions however the experimental and computational efforts for such alternatives at field scales would be tremendous doro et al 2015 sanchez le√≥n et al 2016 therefore fusion of ht data with other types of information such as geological information zhao et al 2016 zha et al 2017 and in situ measurements berg and illman 2015 zhao and illman 2018 which may be readily available at sites as well as high resolution k measurements by direct push approaches liu et al 2009 bohling et al 2016 zhao and illman 2022a b that could be obtained more efficiently should deserve more attention in

2724,hydraulic tomography ht has been developed over the last two decades to image subsurface heterogeneity at high resolution that is critically important to robust solute transport predictions in this study ht based on two concepts i e geological zonation and geostatistical inversion models was utilized to characterize the k distribution of a laboratory sandbox aquifer at different parameter resolutions we compared the estimated k fields for predicting independent pumping tests and solute transport using the classical advection dispersion equation ade the impact of using geological zonation models of varying accuracy for ht analyses was investigated results revealed that when being calibrated to datasets from multiple pumping tests geological zonation models that faithfully represented the true stratigraphy predicted groundwater flow satisfactorily the deterministic k field of the calibrated reliable geological zonation models satisfactorily reproduced the preferential migration path of the observed tracer plume and the breakthrough curves btcs at sampling ports with further resolving the inter and intra layer heterogeneity the reconstructed k fields by ht better predicted both migrating plumes and btcs for two conservative tracer tests the estimated dispersivity values for ade only resulted in slight improvements in the fitting between observed and simulated solute tracer data it also demonstrated the need of integrating reliable geological information into the geostatistical inversion approach to reproduce geological structures in k fields our study suggested the proper consideration of geological zonation between boreholes during field implementation of ht to yield improved solute transport results keywords aquifer heterogeneity solute transport hydraulic tomography geological model dipole tracer test hydrodynamic dispersion longitudinal and transverse dispersivity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater flow and solute transport predictions in geological porous media have received persistent attention over the past several decades for the significant impacts on assessing groundwater contamination hazards design of effective remediation systems as well as on water supply and resource management issues abriola 1987 rudolph et al 1991 christiansen et al 2004 worthington et al 2012 maliva et al 2016 cho et al 2020 although porous media is widely acknowledged to be heterogeneous from pore to regional scales fiori 1998 dentz et al 2011 detailed mapping of spatial heterogeneity in hydrogeological parameters renders the accurate predictions of groundwater flow and contaminant migration as difficult tasks in complex subsurface environments kitanidis 2015 cirpka and valocchi 2016 ever since the mid 1980s extensive efforts have been invested to understand the controlling impacts of subsurface heterogeneity on solute transport one early landmark field experiment was conducted at the mildly heterogeneous canadian forces base borden site ontario mackay et al 1986 freyberg 1986 sudicky 1986 sudicky and illman 2011 where the vertically averaged chloride plume evolved into a relatively smooth bivariate gaussian shape over the first 647 days freyberg 1986 and sudicky 1986 successfully validated stochastic theories gelhar and axness 1983 dagan 1982 1984 in predicting the macroscopic behaviors of plume migration at the site and led to the recognition of the importance of heterogeneity in hydraulic conductivity k field for solute transport predictions later at the north bay site with a variance of ln k œÉ2 lnk of 1 79 sudicky et al 2010 demonstrated that the use of a three dimensional numerical model with statistically derived effective k and macrodispersivity calculated with theoretical models from gelhar and axness 1983 and input to standard forms of groundwater flow and advection dispersion ade equations resulted in reliable groundwater flow and solute transport predictions this study further demonstrated that the contaminant plume length was relatively insensitive to the value of longitudinal macrodispersivity at the more heterogeneous macrodispersion experiment made site œÉ2 lnk 4 5 by rehfeldt et al 1992 on the columbus air force base in mississippi united states zheng and jiao 1998 and feehley et al 2000 stated that solute transport simulations based on k fields interpolated from point measurements and the ade were inadequate to reproduce the asymmetric feature of the observed plumes which stimulated the use of alternative solute transport models such as the dual domain mass transfer model feehley et al 2000 harvey and gorelick 2000 the continuous time random walk approach berkowitz et al 2006 and the ade based on fractional derivatives lu et al 2002 zheng et al 2011 barlebo et al 2004 and hill et al 2006 contended that tritium migration at the made site could be explained by the ade based on a calibrated zonal groundwater model while molz et al 2006 asserted that to achieve such a conclusion an unrealistic k value had to be assigned to the zone located downstream of the tracer test regardless of the vigorous debates over the validity of ade in the groundwater research community accurate characterization of subsurface heterogeneity has been frequently proven to be one key issue in improving predictions of solute transport salamon et al 2007 zheng et al 2011 illman et al 2012 guo et al 2021 so far numerous studies have been published to understand the benefits of high

useful insights on this topic perfect knowledge of site specific subsurface heterogeneity in the field is practically impossible to delineate with existing technology therefore alternative approaches have been proposed to obtain high resolution estimation of k distributions for laboratory or field investigations for example through a laboratory sandbox study pollock and cirpka 2012 obtained the cm scale k distribution by inverting electrical resistivity tomography data and hydraulic head measurements and successfully predicted the transient movement of a salt tracer plume in the field by explicitly representing the variability of k at submeter scale based on 2 495 flowmeter measurements salamon et al 2007 illustrated that the ade was capable of reproducing the anomalous spreading of the made 2 tracer plume dogan et al 2014 characterized the made site with 5 254 k measurements obtained by the direct push method at a vertical resolution of 1 5 cm their work demonstrated that with the adequate characterization of the k field the classical ade reasonably reproduced the observed plume of a tracer test in a recent study bianchi and zheng 2016 considered lithological data rather than extraordinarily high resolution measurements of k to generate geologically consistent realizations for the made site they showed that the non fickian solute transport behavior can be adequately simulated by a local ade based model during the last two decades hydraulic tomography ht has been developed as one robust approach for the high resolution mapping of spatial distribution of hydraulic parameters e g gottlieb and dietrich 1995 yeh and liu 2000 bohling et al 2002 liu et al 2002 brauchler et al 2003 zhu and yeh 2005 cardiff et al 2012 berg and illman 2011 hochstetler et al 2016 mao et al 2018 zhao and illman 2018 zha et al 2019 wang et al 2021 in the majority of published ht works k and or specific storage ss fields were reconstructed through inversion of pressure head data of multiple pumping tests the performance of reconstructed k and ss fields were usually evaluated for their abilities of predicting independent pumping tests yeh and liu 2000 cardiff et al 2013 and illman et al 2015 suggested significant information loss of the recovered k heterogeneity when pumping observation density was reduced beyond the geostatistical correlation lengths some ht studies have advocated the use of solute or heat tracers test data for the inverse modeling of k or transmissivity fields e g yeh and zhu 2007 zhu et al 2009 illman et al 2010a brauchler et al 2013 schwede et al 2014 lee and kitanidis 2014 somogyv√°ri and bayer 2017 vu and jardani 2022 while only a limited number of studies have attempted to validate the inverted high resolution k fields in their ability of predicting solute transport through a synthetic two dimensional aquifer ni et al 2009 showed the hydraulic tomography survey and the geostatistical inversion approach can be used to characterize flow and transport in heterogeneous aquifers they stated that the flow field based on the ht inverted k field can yield accurate predictions of btc peaks and phases without intensive experiments to calibrate accurate dispersivities at sites so far only several validation studies have been conducted through laboratory or field ht experiments for example illman et al 2010a presented laboratory experiments to examine the efficacy of hydraulic and partitioning tracer tomography for the purpose of imaging dnapl source zones through travel time based ht jim√©nez et al 2015 reconstructed the high resolution hydraulic parameters at the stegem√ºhle site g√∂ttingen lower saxony germany they concluded that comparison of model based predictions with tracer tests at the site revealed that the reliability of the derived aquifer model exhibited limitations in reproducing btcs through combining k field estimated from ht with the calibrated parameters for the dual domain transport model sanchez le√≥n et al 2016 presented a field study to show the improved prediction of the btcs at the extraction well for an independent tracer test illman et al 2012 demonstrated through sandbox experiments that the spatial distribution of k estimated by ht led to improved predictions of groundwater flow and solute transport in heterogeneous aquifers unlike the work by jim√©nez et al 2015 and sanchez le√≥n et al 2016 where the performances of reconstructed k fields in solute transport predictions were validated only using btcs illman et al 2012 also compared the simulated concentration distributions to photographs of migrating plumes during the tracer test which is of great use to assess the quality of the inversion results and to detect preferential flow paths in the k field so far laboratory and field studies are lacking in investigating the value of geological models calibrated to multiple pumping tests as well as the benefits of considering geological information in geostatistics based ht for the prediction of btcs and the migration of tracer plumes in this study we continued to evaluate the performance of high resolution k fields obtained by ht in predictions of tracer tests through laboratory sandbox experiments with additional purposes of 1 investigating the usefulness of geological information in improving the performance of the highly parameterized geostatistical model and 2 assessing the value of a solute transport model calibrated to tracer test data in improving predictions of solute transport with the reconstructed k fields by ht we first examine the performance of geological zonation models uncalibrated and calibrated of varying accuracy and geostatistical models in a multi layered laboratory sandbox with known stratigraphy in terms of predicting multiple pumping tests then based on the reconstructed k fields the classical ade was adopted to evaluate whether the tracer plume of one conservative tracer test could be reproduced or not for the controlled sandbox experiment next a second conservative tracer test was used to demonstrate the benefits of including calibrated transport parameters for the highly parameterized geostatistical models this study provides further insights in the joint use of geological data and ht for the improved predictions of solute transport in multi layered aquifer systems which is of particular importance because hydrogeologists and practitioners can easily rely on a single geological model and in situ estimates of hydraulic parameters to guide remediation plans at contaminant sites 2 laboratory sandbox data the synthetic heterogeneous aquifer was constructed in a vertical laboratory sandbox by illman et al 2010b through cyclically depositing sands of various sizes to create an interfingering fluvial structure the sandbox is 193 0 cm in length 82 6 cm in height and 10 2 cm in width forty eight fully penetrating horizontal wells along six columns were installed on the back wall of the sandbox for pumping injection or monitoring purposes fig 1 is the front view of the synthetic aquifer showing the layout of the deposits with numbers indicating layers and ports the sandbox aquifer was initially characterized through permeameter analyses of core samples single hole pumping tests and constant rate pumping tests by illman et al 2010b during which constant head boundaries were simultaneously maintained at the top left and right sides of the sandbox aquifer and the front back and bottom faces were set as no flow then illman et al 2012 conducted a series of dipole hydraulic and tracer experiments with setting all faces around the synthetic aquifer as no flow boundaries specifically 16 dipole tests were conducted by pumping from one port and injecting the pumped water at another port at an average injection pumping rate of 480 ml min to maintain water mass balance eight tests i e e2 i47 e for extraction and i for injection 2 and 47 for port numbers e42 i7 e4 i45 e15 i34 e24 i25 e17 i32 e23 i26 and e20 i29 were chosen for model calibration see fig 1 for port locations the other eight tests i e e8 i41 e9 i40 e10 i39 e11 i38 e12 i37 e16 i33 e18 i31 and e30 i19 were kept for model validation purposes for each dipole test pressure head changes were monitored at all 48 ports with 0 to 1 psig pounds per square inch gauge setra model 209 pressure transducers pumping and injection continued until the development of steady state flow conditions which were determined from the stabilized head measurements then two dipole tracer tests were conducted by injecting bromide solution as the conservative tracer for conservative tracer test 1 ctt1 water was injected at port 42 with a flow rate of 372 4 ml min to achieve water mass balance the pumping rate at port 7 was kept at 304 ml min and a cumulative rate of 68 4 ml min was set for other 12 sampling lines at different locations ports 2 10 12 14 19 22 27 30 35 37 39 and 47 after the flow field reached steady state conditions a valve in the injection line of port 42 was switched from water to a bromide fisher scientific pittsburgh pennsylvania solution with an average concentration of 151 3 mg l the tracer solution contained 70 ml of blue food coloring tone s food coloring to enable the visual observation of the tracer plume evolution through the frontal glass of the sandbox after 10 min injection of the tracer solution the injection line at port 42 was switched back to clean water the water sampling campaign at extraction port 7 and the other 12 sampling locations was continued for a period of 5 h to record the migration of the bromide tracer in the sandbox aquifer a total of 780 samples were collected with an average of 60 samples for each of the 12 sampling lines and at port 7 for the conservative tracer test 2 ctt2 the tracer solution was injected at port 37 while water was extracted at port 12 and 634 samples were collected from 11 sampling lines ports 7 9 12 17 21 24 25 28 32 40 and 42 during both tracer tests photographs of the sandbox were taken at various times to show the plume migrations upon completion of the experiment bromide concentrations were determined using an ion chromatograph ic dionex ics 2000 dionex sunnyvale california at the university of waterloo 3 models used for k field characterizations 3 1 geological zonation models to evaluate the usefulness of geological information on groundwater flow and transport three geological models of varying accuracy were constructed for the sandbox aquifer the first geological model was built based on the stratigraphy information shown on the frontal glass fig 1 unlike geological models usually constructed through interpolating stratigraphy information from borehole logs luo et al 2017 or estimating stratigraphy from geophysical approaches dogan et al 2011 this geological model assumed the perfect knowledge of aquifer stratification thus representing the best case scenario and named as geo perfect during the construction of the 18 layer sandbox aquifer commercial sands of varying grain sizes were used to create different layers by illman et al 2010b with layers 5 and 6 consisting of mixed types of sands of different sizes these two layers showed strong sub layering behaviors during partitioning tracer tests by illman and yeh 2011 we therefore defined sub layers 5 sub and 6 sub to more faithfully represent the geological zonation information the second geological model was constructed to represent the scenario that geological stratigraphy of the 18 layer aquifer was assumed to be known along the six columns of wells in fig 1 mimicking the accurate knowledge of stratigraphy along boreholes in the field the stratigraphy of this geological model was interpolated using the software leapfrog hydro aranz geo limited 2015 which utilizes the fast radial basis function method to implement dual kriging to interpolate stratigraphy information between well columns compared to the accurate stratigraphy shown in fig s1a see supplementary information si section the second geological model in fig s1b showed some obvious differences in the geometries of different layers due to the interpolation between well columns especially at the outside area along boundaries thus named as geo good for the construction of the third geological model in fig s1c systematic errors were added to the thicknesses of layering information along the six columns of wells leading to the obvious deterioration of the interpolated stratigraphy compared to the actual stratigraphy shown in the sandbox fig s1a both the width and thickness of the interpolated stratigraphy were varied especially for the layers in the central part of the sandbox this geological model was named as geo poor five cases cases 1a 1b 1c 1d and 1e were compared to investigate the performances of geological zonation models of different accuracy and through assigning each geological unit with k values estimated from different techniques in cases 1a and 1b we utilized the geo perfect model and k measurements determined from two conventional site characterization approaches namely constant head permeameter tests and single hole pumping tests illman et al 2010b the constant head permeameter tests were conducted on core samples extracted at 48 port locations single hole pumping tests were performed at 48 port locations to estimate k values table 1 summarizes the sand types and k estimates for each unit of the sandbox aquifer for the unit intersected by multiple ports a geometric mean value of k measurements was provided in cases 1c 1d and 1e k values were estimated through simultaneously calibrating the geo perfect geo good and geo poor models respectively to the eight dipole tests described in section 2 1 3 2 geostatistical inversion models in order to characterize the k field of the heterogeneous sandbox at a higher parameter resolution we performed geostatistical inverse analyses of eight dipole tests using the simultaneous successive linear estimator simsle code xiang et al 2009 the geostatistical inversion approach implemented in simsle treats the lnk values of the heterogeneous porous media as stochastic processes with given prior information such as the unconditional means variances œÉ2 ln k and correlation scales Œªx Œªy and Œªz simsle creates the initial conditional mean parameter field through conditioning on available measurements of hydraulic parameters and observed head with cokriging the uncertainty of the initially conditioned effective parameter field was represented by the residual variance of each parameter at every material block the parameter field is then used to solve groundwater flow equations to obtain simulated pressure heads based on the differences between simulated and observed pressure heads simsle iteratively improves the estimated hydraulic parameters as well as the associated residual variance until the differences between the two continuous estimated hydraulic parameter fields or the largest difference between simulated and observed heads is smaller than a specified tolerance we assumed that the hydraulic parameter fields can be described by the exponential covariance model four cases were considered with differences in the initial values for k case 2a as 8 0 10 2 cm s cases 2b 2c and 2d the estimated k fields from cases 1c 1d and 1e respectively while œÉ2 ln k 3 0 Œªx 50 0 cm Œªy 10 2 cm and Œªz 10 0 cm to be consistent with a previous study zhao et al 2016 4 results 4 1 model calibration to simulate groundwater flow for both forward and inverse modeling of geological zonation and geostatistical approaches the synthetic sandbox aquifer was discretized into 11 826 elements and 24 124 nodes with an average element dimension of 1 0 cm 1 0 cm 10 2 cm such a fine computational grid was reported to be suitable for solute transport simulations in the synthetic sandbox aquifer by illman et al 2012 while maintaining a reasonable computational cost after mapping the 48 pumping injection and observation ports onto the simulation grid steady state groundwater flow simulations of the eight dipole tests needed by model calibration were conducted using the finite element code mmoc3 yeh et al 1993 which can simulate groundwater flow and solute transport under fully and variably saturated conditions all six faces of the sandbox were set as no flow boundaries during forward simulations of dipole pumping injection tests for the calibration of three geological zonation models introduced in section 3 1 pixel by pixel information regarding the geological layers was transferred from leapfrog hydro to the computational grid in mmoc3 zonal homogeneity and isotropy were assumed for each layer of three geological models to capture the interlayer heterogeneity of k fields in each of three geological models 18 parameters of k were estimated through coupling the forward simulation code mmoc3 yeh et al 1993 and parameter estimation code pest doherty 2015 for the sub layers 5 sub and 6 sub in the geo perfect model k values were kept same as the estimate for layer 14 due to the use of f75 sand as fine sand material for the mixed components estimation of k values for the geological zonation models cases 1c 1d and 1e were performed by minimizing the objective function that represented a weighted sum of squared differences between observed pressure heads and those simulated by mmoc3 yeh et al 1993 model parameters were iteratively optimized by pest doherty 2015 based on the derivatives of all 368 observed heads from eight dipole tests with respect to 18 adjustable parameters calibration runs of geological models were performed on a pc with a quad core cpu with 24 gb of ram the optimization process converged when the lowest four objective function values were within a relative distance of 0 05 for the highly parameterized geostatistical inversion models based on simsle calibration runs were performed on a pc with a 12 core cpu and 256 gb of ram unlike the calibration of geological zonation models where estimated k fields were constrained by the stratigraphy of varying accuracy pixel by pixel correlation relationships between k and observed pressure heads from dipole tests were explored to reflect the incorporation of head data we selected inversion results from the iteration step at which the mean square error l2 norms have stabilized which indicated the convergence of the inverse estimation process xiang et al 2009 the quality of matches between simulated and observed drawdowns after model calibrations was assessed through scatterplots and the best fit lines and coefficient of determination r2 the mean absolute error l1 and l2 were calculated for each dipole test to further evaluate the fits between observed and simulated drawdowns the l2 norm magnifies large discrepancies and allows one to better assess the different models those quantities were computed as 1 l 1 1 n i 1 n œá i œá i 2 l 2 1 n i 1 n œá i œá i 2 where n is the total number of drawdown data i indicates the data number œá and œá i represent the simulated and measured drawdowns respectively fig 2 shows the calibration scatterplots of the geological models and geostatistical inversion models on each subplot we provided the corresponding linear model fit a 45 degree line and r2 value in all seven cases the observed drawdowns were well fitted by model calibration processes with r2 values varying from 0 952 to 0 997 the calibration results of geological models fig 2a to c were worse than those of geostatistical inversion cases fig 2d to g the main reason is that the highly parameterized geostatistical model has a larger degree of freedom to adjust the unknown k values than the zonation based geological models 4 2 comparison of different k fields fig 3 shows the contour plots of k fields for two uncalibrated geological models populated with k estimates from the permeameter test fig 3a and single hole test fig 3b and three geological models calibrated to eight dipole tests fig 3c to e fig 3f g h and i are k fields estimated by ht starting with uniform prior mean and with heterogeneous k means from case 1c case 1d and case 1e the estimated k values for cases 1c 1d and 1e are listed in tables 1 and 2 examination of fig 3a and c reveals that the distribution patterns of high and low k zones are quite different among the uncalibrated and calibrated geo perfect geological models with the estimated k field in fig 3c showing obviously more heterogeneous features than k fields using estimates from the permeameter and single hole tests with using less accurate geological layering information the calibrated geo good model in fig 3d shows an overall high and low k pattern similar to the fig 3c while k values are different between two calibrated geological models through comparing the pixel by pixel distribution of different layers 83 73 of the 12 636 elements in the geo good model matched with the elements in the geo perfect model for the geo poor model due to the use of incorrect layering information along the six columns of wells only 60 73 of elements in the geo poor model matched with the elements in the geo perfect model the estimated k field for the geo poor model in fig 3e obviously shows a different heterogeneous pattern to those of the geo perfect and geo good models in terms of the shape and locations of the high k zones the estimated k field by ht analysis in case 2a shares some similar distribution pattern as case 1c although the positions and shapes of high and low k zones in fig 3f are not strictly consistent when being compared to those in fig 3c for the geostatistical inversion cases 2b 2c and 2d after using k values of the calibrated geological models fig 3c d and e as the initial means for the geostatistical inversion approach the estimated k tomograms in fig 3g to i show both the inter and intra layer variability 4 3 prediction of independent dipole pumping tests we next evaluated the reconstructed k fields through comparing their performances in simulating eight additional dipole tests not used in the calibration effort fig 4 shows the scatterplots of observed versus simulated drawdowns examination of fig 4a and b reveals that the geological zonation models populated with k values from either permeameter or single hole tests produce biased predictions of drawdowns while performances of the former are better that the latter in terms of l1 and l2 norms when the k values estimated from model calibration were used the geological zonation model predicted drawdowns of eight pumping tests quite well with r2 increased to 0 968 and significantly lowered l1 and l2 norms fig 4c compared to fig 4c the calibrated geo good and geo poor models performed worse for the drawdown predictions of eight dipole tests in terms of l1 and l2 norms as shown in fig 4d and e still both geological models performed better than the two uncalibrated geological models shown in fig 4a and b these results suggest that k estimates obtained from the calibrations of the geological zonation models to multiple pumping tests can better represent the heterogeneous k features of the sandbox aquifer than those k estimates based on permeameter and single hole tests we also noted that the geostatistical inversion model case 2a yielded improved drawdown predictions comparing to cases 1a and 1b while the linear fit metrics r2 l1 and l2 of case 2a were slightly worse than those of case 1c the geostatistical inversion models in cases 2b 2c and 2d using the calibrated geological models as prior k means all performed better than the case 2a in predictions of eight dipole tests as shown in fig 4g and h the geostatistical inversion cases using k fields from the calibrated geo perfect and geo good models performed similarly well for drawdown predictions in terms of r2 l1 and l2 the performance of the geostatistical inversion case using k field from the calibrated geo poor model showed slightly worse l1 and l2 metrics than those in fig 4g and h these findings together with the k tomograms shown in fig 3f to i reveal that structural features introduced into k fields by the geostatistical inversion approach can be helpful for the predictions of pumping tests used for model validations 4 4 simulation of the e7 i42 dipole tracer test 4 4 1 migration behavior of tracer plume to further evaluate the solute transport prediction performances of different geological models and geostatistical models we simulated the migration of the bromide plume during the e7 i42 dipole tracer test using the groundwater flow and solute transport modeling code mmoc3 yeh et al 1993 the conservative solute transport in the saturated porous media was modeled with the classical ade the longitudinal Œ±l and transverse Œ±t dispersivities were set as zero and the effective porosity was set to be 0 36 for all cases in later sections Œ±l and Œ±t values obtained from model calibrations to tracer test will be utilized and discussed fig 5 and fig s2 show the tracer plume observed from the front glass of the sandbox and relative concentration distributions simulated by different modeling cases snapshots of concentration distributions at four time periods were selected for visual comparisons at t 12 min fig 5 a two minutes after removing the tracer injection source the blue color plume distributed as a snail shape with a preferential migration path developing along layer 4 below injection port 42 examination of fig 5 reveals that 1 geological zonation model geo perfect populated with in situ k estimates from permeameter or single hole tests predicted the general locations of the plume but failed to capture the preferential migration paths 2 the geo perfect geological model calibrated to ht datasets provided obviously improved predictions of the plume with the lateral fingering features being vividly reproduced at the lower portion of the plume and 3 the migrating plumes predicted by the calibrated geo good and geo poor geological models were similar to the one by the geo perfect model while the shape and spatial distribution of the high concentration zones e g c c0 0 95 among three cases were different when using a homogeneous prior mean 8 0 10 2 m s for k estimation the geostatistical model case 2a also predicted the overall shape of the tracer plume fig 5 while the fingering features were not as accurately captured as shown in the observed plume when using the calibrated geological models geo perfect and geo good as prior mean k for cases 2b and 2c the geostatistical inversion cases produced tracer plumes similar to cases 1c and 1d with only slight differences visible from the shape as well as the connectivity of the upper and lower high c c0 zones when using the calibrated geological model geo poor as the prior mean k in case 2d more differences become apparent between the tracer plumes in case 1e and those predicted by the geostatistical inversion case 2d in fig 5 at t 27 min fig 5b the blue color plume migrated both laterally and vertically lateral transport was rapid and mostly noticeable along layer 4 near the bottom boundary of the sandbox while vertical migration was constrained by the relatively low k layer near the top of the plume simulated distributions by five geological models revealed quite different lateral migration patterns with the preferential transport path distributed in the upper middle and lower middle areas of the sandbox for cases 1c 1d and 1e in fig 5b respectively while the simulated tracer distributions of cases 1a and 1b showed no distinctive preferential migration paths four geostatistical modeling cases reproduced the observed preferential transport features while the shapes of high c c0 zones were different among cases 2a 2b 2c and 2d specifically the geostatistical inversion case 2a produced two preferential paths due to the existence of high k zones in the middle and lower part of the reconstructed k tomogram in fig 3f the fingering of the tracer plume was more obvious at the lower preferential flow path by further using k values from calibrated the geo perfect and geo good models as prior mean k fields the fingering of predicted tracer plumes was less profound for both cases 2b and 2c in fig 5b when the k field estimated by the calibration of geo poor model was used as prior distribution the geostatistical inversion case 2d generated a plume shape that was quite different from case 1e in terms of fingering locations suggesting the impact of geostatistical calibration process on the prior k field estimated by case 1e at t 100 min fig s2a preferential transport along high k layers had been routed toward the extraction port 7 and the observed plume was diluted the outer boundary of blue colored area also became diluted appearing blurred visually at t 175 min fig s2b the tracer solution was diluted by the injected clean water resulting in the dye being only faintly visible at both time points tracer plumes simulated by cases 1c 2d showed similar features in terms of the covered areas although there were some differences in areas along boundaries fig s2 more distinctive differences could be observed when comparing the diluted regions inside simulated plumes showing the flushing of the tracer in the synthetic aquifer with clean water we next evaluate different models more quantitatively through comparing the predicted versus observed breakthrough curves and scatterplots of simulated versus observed c c0 in following sections 4 4 2 prediction of breakthrough curves at point sampling ports fig 6 shows the observed and simulated breakthrough curves at 13 sampling locations ports 2 7 10 12 14 19 27 22 30 35 37 39 and 47 for five geological modeling cases the matches of the breakthrough curves at port 35 were quite consistent for all cases as shown in fig 6 while matches of simulated breakthrough curves to observation data showed distinctive differences for the other ports we observed that geological zonation models relying on point measurements of k from permeameter and single hole tests cases 1a and 1b predicted either the early or late arrivals of tracers at most sampled ports in contrast the calibrated geo perfect model case 1c showed clear improvements of matches between the simulated and observed btcs for the geo good model in case 1d the predicted btcs were close to those of the case 1c with the largest difference shown for the btc at port 27 as the geological model became less accurate the geo poor model case 1e showed mismatches at more ports between the simulated and observed btcs in fig 6 these results highlight the benefits of using calibrated k values instead of measurements from permeameter or single hole tests to better represent k heterogeneity in the zonal mean sense for the four geostatistical inversion modeling cases fig 7 simsle using a homogeneous prior mean predicted the breakthrough curves well except the mismatches at five ports ports 2 7 22 27 and 37 in case 2b the matches of simulated btcs were quite similar to those from case 1c with only slight mismatch at port 22 the geostatistical inversion case 2c predicted the observed btcs well at nearly all ports except port 27 when the k field estimated by the calibration of geo poor model was used as prior distribution the geostatistical inversion case 2d produced obviously poor matches of btcs at ports 12 22 27 and 39 suggesting the importance in using accurate structural information for the prediction of solute transport at a fine scale the solute transport prediction results were then evaluated by directly comparing the simulated versus observed relative concentrations at all 13 sampling ports as shown in fig 8 to improve the discrimination of results we computed the bivariate kernel density scott 1992 silverman1986 carr 2003 at each data point for the scatterplots of different cases the kernel density estimator implemented in the scikit learn library in python was utilized and the default setting of gaussian kernel function was adopted for the estimator pedregosa et al 2011 a high kernel density value suggests data points are more intensely distributed around certain data points silverman1986 king et al 2016 and vice versa for the convenience of using a consistent color bar the maximum density value in each subplot of figs 8 and 11 was scaled to unity we also colored the letters of linear fit results l1 and l2 norms to increase the readability of figures examination of fig 8 reveals that prediction results of cases 1a and 1b were worse than the other cases the fitting metrics r2 l1 and l2 of the geo perfect model cases 1c calibrated to ht test data improved markedly which were better than the highly parameterized geostatistical inversion model case 2a we see in fig 8 that the data points with high kernel density values more consistently distributed along the 45 degree line in fig 8c and g than those in other subfigures this makes sense since the inter layer heterogeneity feature played a dominant role in plume migration as shown in fig 4a the geostatistical inversion case 2b yielded the best simulation results in terms of r2 and l1 among all five models the geostatistical inversion case 2c using k values from calibrated geo good as prior k field yielded the second best simulation results while using k values from calibrated geo poor model as prior k field yielded poorer results in terms of r2 and l2 we reiterate here that the differences among three geological models geo perfect geo good and geo poor are due to the amount and accuracy of geological information used to build the geological layers as expected we see the clearly reduced performances in predicting independent dipole pumping tests and relative tracer concentrations from the geo perfect model to the geo poor model more importantly when the site geology was poorly represented the geo poor model was less reliable in predicting the tracer concentrations than drawdown predictions at the same locations based on results shown in figs 4 and 8 one advantage of the geological zonation model lies in its low complexity which can be justified sufficiently well by a relatively less amount of calibration data than high resolution models sch√∂niger et al 2015 these results revealed that the heterogeneity of k would strongly affect the migration and removal of solutes which highlighted again the need in accurately imaging the three dimensional geometry of layers between boreholes 5 discussion 5 1 value of the calibrated transport model parameters for predictions of dipole tracer tests in the above sections the longitudinal and transverse dispersivities Œ±l and Œ±t were assumed to be zero in the ade thus neglecting the impact of mechanical dispersion processes on the simulated tracer plume and btcs to examine this issue Œ±l and Œ±t were treated as homogeneous and estimated through coupling the model independent parameter estimation code pest doherty 2015 and the groundwater flow and solute transport modeling code mmoc3 yeh et al 1993 to fit the 13 observed btcs of the e7 i42 test previous laboratory experiments and field studies have suggested that the solute dispersion process was scale dependent gelhar et al 1992 sudicky et al 1983 vishal and leung 2015 and the value of Œ±t was frequently assumed to be 10 of Œ±l zhang and gable 2008 pollock and cirpka 2012 sanchez le√≥n et al 2016 other studies also reported that such a ratio could vary for different experimental settings kim et al 2004 zech et al 2019 therefore for the current study Œ±l and Œ±t were treated as independent and inversely estimated for cases 1c 1d 2a 2b and 2c while cases 1a 1b 1e and 2i were excluded for their obviously poor prediction performances shown in figs 5 6 7 and 8 the calibration results of tracer test data were plotted in fig 9 and estimated Œ±l and Œ±t values were provided in each subplot generally there were consistent improvements in the linear fits between the simulated and observed c c0 in terms l2 norms among the five cases while the r2 and l1 norms showed no such consistency when comparing fig 9 to fig 8 this was expected as the sum of mean square errors between observed and simulated c c0 was used as objective functions during parameter estimation processes the calibrated dispersivity values varied from 3 70e 4 to 1 54e 1 cm and from 4 54e 3 to 8 68e 1 cm for Œ±l and Œ±t respectively these estimated values of Œ±l and Œ±t were close to the values reported for laboratory porous medium with similar grain size of 0 25 1 25 mm klenk and grathwohl 2002 rolle et al 2009 ballarini et al 2012 as the same tracer test data were used for parameter estimations differences in the estimated dispersivity values could be attributed to different k fields used among cases 1c 1d 2a 2b and 2c compared to the geological zonation modeling cases cases 1c and 1d where k values were treated as layer wise homogeneous fig 3c and d intra layer heterogeneity was additionally resolved for the k fields in fig 3g and h by the geostatistical inversion processes cases 2b and 2c such additional details to k fields on one hand led to the improved predictions of btcs in figs 6 and 7 and improved match of observed and simulated c c0 in fig 8 on the other hand led to smaller values of Œ±l and Œ±t estimated for cases 2b and 2c these results suggested that when k heterogeneity was better resolved smaller dispersivity values representing pore or local scale dispersion processes were tended to be obtained through the inverse modeling approach this is in line with the previous finding by liu et al 2010 that the dispersivity values decreased in solute transport models when heterogeneity of k was considered to further validate the estimated k fields and Œ±l and Œ±t values through calibrating groundwater flow model and solute transport model to eight dipole tests and the e7 i42 dipole tracer test another conservative dipole tracer test e12 i37 was simulated and the results were compared to the observed tracer plume as well as btcs at 11 sampling ports fig 10 shows the observed plume at three different stages early 6 min middle 25 min and late 151 min and relative concentration distributions simulated by cases 2a 2b and 2c using the reconstructed k fields and estimated Œ±l and Œ±t values from the ctt1 test at time t 6 min the tracer plume was confined within a flat zone as shown in fig 10a the simsle inversion case 2a starting with homogeneous prior mean over predicted the thickness of the plume in the vertical direction while cases 2b and 2c reproduced the plume significantly better in terms of the overall shape as well as the lateral fingering as the plume gradually migrated toward the extraction port 12 located at the top right of the sandbox aquifer case 2a only reproduced the overall trend of the plume at t 25 min while cases 2b and 2c also showed more details in the concentration distributions at finer scales at late time t 151 min the tracer plume became diluted and only the general pattern was outlined in fig 10a cases 2a 2b and 2c showed similar distribution patterns in fig 10b c and d we next compared the predicted and observed tracer data and btcs for the ctt2 dipole tracer test in figs 11 and 12 for cases 2a 2b and 2c the Œ±l and Œ±t values in ade were assumed to be zero for fig 11a b and c while those values were adopted from the calibration of the ctt1 dipole tracer test in fig 11d e and f we see in fig 11 that data points with high kernel density values distributed along the 45 degree line more consistently for case 2b in fig 11b and e than those in the other two cases the scatterplots in fig 11 and btcs in fig 12 showed that adopting the calibrated Œ±l and Œ±t values for ade only resulted in slight improvements in the fitting of observed and simulated c c0 for case 2a such impacts on the results of cases 2b and 2c were negligible here we acknowledge that the effects of numerical dispersion on solute transport simulations by mmoc3 yeh et al 1993 could be one potential factor affecting the values of calibrated Œ±l and Œ±t in figs 9 and 11 that is even by assuming Œ±l and Œ±t to be zero in the ade the mixing effect during solute transport simulations by mmoc3 yeh et al 1993 results in the spatial averaging of simulated concentrations over the finite element grid su et al 2020 thus tends to yield underestimated dispersivity values during the calibration of observed btcs from ctt1 tracer test mehl and hill 2001 maina et al 2018 although the influence of numerical dispersion can be reduced by using a finer grid and smaller time steps rubin et al 1997 konikow 2011 the observed btcs in figs 6 and 12 show no obvious abrupt changes suggesting the controlling influence from both advection and mechanical dispersion on tracer migration during the dipole tracer tests 5 2 impacts of incorporating geological information into ht for improved predictions of solute tracer transport studies over the last several decades suggested that satisfactory solute transport models would always require significant efforts in dealing with subsurface heterogeneity konikow 2011 zheng et al 2011 sudicky and illman 2011 in our laboratory study k fields were reconstructed through conceptualizing the sandbox aquifer as geological zonation and geostatistical models when being calibrated to multiple dipole test datasets for ht analysis it is interesting to see in figs 5 to 7 that the geological models of varying accuracy yielded improved predictions of tracer plume evolutions and improved fittings between the simulated and observed btcs over those based on the geo perfect geological model and k estimates from permeameter tests or single hole tests therefore aside from those numerous field efforts in characterizing the k heterogeneity through extensive sampling of cores results of our study highlighted the value of calibration of geological models in capturing the overall heterogeneous pattern of the k field while fine scale k estimates may be obtained through high resolution characterization techniques such as direct push techniques dogan et al 2014 obtaining reliable k estimates between boreholes including its connectivity appears to be one of the key ingredients in accurate solute transport predictions for field studies caution should be paid to construct accurate geological models in this regard the combined use of ground penetrating radar gpr and direct push hydraulic profiling dphp have shown to provide high resolution estimates of the three dimensional geometry of hydrostratigraphic zones dogan et al 2011 mccall et al 2017 zhao and illman 2022a b meanwhile the issue of data resolution would also affect performances of the calibrated geological and geostatistical models in terms of predicting independent pumping tests as noted by previous studies e g cardiff et al 2013 illman et al 2015 zhao et al 2016 here we further investigated the effects of observation data density on the calibration of the geo good model and subsequent performances in predicting pumping tests and tracer tests instead of using eight dipole pumping tests and 48 observation ports one more scenario using four dipole pumping tests and 24 observation ports were selected for the model calibration the calibrated k values were listed in table s1 compared to the k field in fig 3d the contour plot of k field in fig 13 a shows a similar overall distribution pattern of high and low k value zones while differences could be identified due to the use of reduced number of pressure head data for model calibration we also see the degraded performance in prediction of independent dipole pumping tests and the ctt1 dipole tracer test when comparing fig 13b and d to fig 4d and fig 8d respectively still the geo good model calibrated to reduced number of observation data performed better in predicting independent pumping tests and the ctt1 tracer test than the geo poor model fig 4e and fig 8e calibrated to data obtained from eight dipole pumping tests and 48 observation ports the simulated tracer plume by the geo good model in fig 13c at time 27 min is also similar to the plume in fig 5b while the shape of high concentration zones e g c c0 0 65 are visually different in the lateral fingering of the simulated migrating plume these results again highlighted the priority of collecting accurate geology data when being utilized for the construction of geology based groundwater models another important finding from this study is that compared to obtaining dispersivity values for the ade through inverse calibration to tracer test data accurate reconstruction of the inter and intra layer heterogeneity of k field through incorporating reliable geological data into the geostatistical inversion approach better predicted both the spatial distribution of the migrating plumes and btcs for two conservative tracer tests evidence from previous field studies suggested that the classical ade approach suffered from the inability to account for fine scale heterogeneity and therefore sufficiently detailed mapping of k was needed to reproduce the observed plume behaviors in heterogeneous aquifers e g feehley et al 2000 konikow 2011 dogan et al 2014 even if many spatially discretized k values could be obtained from in situ and ex situ approaches possible measurement errors uncertainty in spatial interpolation methods as well as variations in regional flow conditions during solute transport simulations in the field would still render the accurate predictions of tracer plumes to be difficult yeh et al 1995 su et al 2020 although the importance of accurately reconstructing k fields with inter and intra layer variation features has been well documented by studies over the last decades e g gelhar et al 1979 abriola 1987 harvey and gorelick 2000 kitanidis 2015 our sandbox experiment results shown in figs 3 to 8 delineated the practical difficulties of using k data obtained by permeameter case 1a and single hole case 1b tests with even the perfect stratigraphy information for the accurate groundwater flow and solute transport simulations for the current study k values in cases 1c 1d and 1e were obtained through calibrating geological models simultaneously to multiple pumping tests to account for the scenario dependent problem during model calibration huang et al 2011 yeh et al 2015 the calibrated geological models assuming zonal homogeneity yielded k fields that produced better drawdown and tracer concentration predictions than the uncalibrated geological models cases 1a and 1b one possible reason for the relative better performance of calibrated geo perfect and geo good geological models is that the sandbox was constructed with sands of various sizes lacking of low permeable layers or sub layers with fine silts and clayey materials for multi aquifer aquitard systems with high heterogeneity such as the north campus research site k 5 75 10 10 4 28 10 3 m s œÉ2 lnk 7 3 by permeameter test in waterloo canada alexander et al 2011 zhao and illman 2022a the performance of geological models assuming zonal homogeneity may be less satisfactory for solute transport predictions due to neglecting the fine scale k variations to resolve the inter and intra layer heterogeneity of k fields we integrated geological information of different accuracy into geostatistical inversion models results of cases 2b and 2c based on the geostatistics based approach more accurately predicted plume migration at the fine scale figs 5 s2 and 10 as well as the matches between simulated and observed btcs in figs 7 and 12 still successful prediction of btcs at all discrete sampling points is a challenging task our laboratory sandbox study clearly showed promising results in improved prediction of solute tracer tests through high resolution characterization of aquifer heterogeneity by ht with the joint use of accurate geological information 6 summary and conclusions in this study we investigated and compared the performances of geological zonation and geostatistical inversion models in predicting conservative solute transport when multiple pumping tests were used to calibrate both models based on the reconstructed k fields the classical ade was adopted to evaluate whether the tracer plume evolution and breakthrough curves could be reproduced or not for the controlled sandbox experiments in addition the value of a calibrated transport model and accurate geological information for predictions of dipole tracer tests were examined with two conservative dipole tracer tests our work resulted in the following major findings and conclusions 1 the estimated k distribution through calibration of the perfect geological model to multiple dipole tests showed heterogeneous patterns of high and low k zones that are obviously different from k fields using estimates of the permeameter tests and single hole tests it is important to note that such perfect geological models are impossible to obtain with current technology incorporating the calibrated geological model as prior k mean field for the geostatistical inversion approach revealed both the inter and intra layer heterogeneity for the sandbox aquifer 2 the correct identification of detailed layering structures in k field by calibrating reliable geological models yielded more accurate predictions of the independent dipole pumping tests and more importantly reproduced the preferential migration paths more vividly compared to the geological zonation models assigned with k values from permeameter and single hole tests this suggests that fine scale characterization of k heterogeneity along boreholes with different characterization approaches yield useful information but they are not sufficient in accurately predicting solute transport the improved prediction of solute transport by the calibrated geological zonation model assumed the perfect knowledge of aquifer stratification was also better than the highly parameterized geostatistical inversion model geostatistical inversion model starting from the calibrated accurate geological model performed satisfactorily in predicting the drawdowns of independent tests and tracer concentration measurements of solute tracer tests 3 in order to benefit site characterization and simulation of solute transport in heterogeneous media the geological zonation model has to be reconstructed as accurate as possible poor characterization and representation of site geology produces more deterioration to simulation results of tracer transport than prediction of pumping tests even when the geological information could be reliably obtained our results revealed that the geostatistical inversion approach which can integrate multiple types of observation data is suggested in order to improve the performances of groundwater flow and transport models this in turn should significantly improve remediation performance and accelerate cleanup time resulting in substantial cost savings we concur that further treating the dispersivity values as spatially heterogeneous fields during the geostatistical inverse modeling approach nowak and cirpka 2006 or joint inversion of hydraulic head data and tracer test data to better resolve the fine scale heterogeneity of k zhu et al 2009 lee and kitanidis 2014 should also improve solute transport predictions however the experimental and computational efforts for such alternatives at field scales would be tremendous doro et al 2015 sanchez le√≥n et al 2016 therefore fusion of ht data with other types of information such as geological information zhao et al 2016 zha et al 2017 and in situ measurements berg and illman 2015 zhao and illman 2018 which may be readily available at sites as well as high resolution k measurements by direct push approaches liu et al 2009 bohling et al 2016 zhao and illman 2022a b that could be obtained more efficiently should deserve more attention in
