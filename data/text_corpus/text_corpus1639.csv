generation perspective study focus the aim of the study is to establish a rainfall runoff model that is fitted in the context of hydro climate characteristics of the basin the study applies a one factor at time oat method for sensitivity analysis sa and a monte carlo method for model calibration and parameter identifiability analysis to identify influential well identified and optimal parameters and to predict uncertainties of a conceptual lumped rainfall runoff model the daily hbv light model for the basin using five performance measures new hydrological insights for the region based on the individual sa the model parameters were reduced from nine to five parameters this can reduce the interaction between model parameters time consuming for model calibration and therefore limiting model prediction uncertainty despite the uncertainties arising from both the model parameters identifiability and calibrated parameter sets themselves the results reveal that the model performance varies from good to very good while the model prediction uncertainty for the behavioural parameter sets reveals that the best simulation with regard to the measured streamflow lies within the narrow 95 uncertainty band therefore this model can be used to support various water resources management initiatives in the basin keywords conceptual rainfall runoff models sensitivity analysis parameter identifiability uncertainty prediction parameter optimization performance evaluation 1 introduction the last two decades have witnessed increasing pressure on the available african water resources due to increased trend in population growth as well as land use and climate changes which also triggered the prospect of a water crisis in africa the water crisis of cape town in 2018 the decrease of water level of the ubangui river in the congo basin with implication on economic navigation and the shrinking of the lake chad that lost about 90 of its wetted surface area during the last four decades are just some of the few cases that we could mention and that reveal the urgent need for sustainable water resources management in the african continent these needs should be supported by adequate knowledge of temporal and spatial scales of variability of water resources to enable application of appropriate management and development strategies trigg and tshimanga 2020 hydrological models are commonly used to address these needs as the models can be established with limited data and generate sufficiently reliable information in support of decision making of water management tshimanga et al 2011 hughes et al 2020 in the context of climate change hydrological models are also useful to provide forecasting for future planning kamga 2001 tshimanga and hughes 2012 2014 meng et al 2016 nonki et al 2019 hughes and farinosi 2020 in the african continent despite the inadequate financial and institutional resources that often constrain the pursuit of high level scientific research there is substantial hydrological research capacity within africa hughes et al 2015 from the perspective for contributing to the three main targets of the new science decade of international association of hydrological sciences iahs panta rhei 2013 2022 montanari et al 2013 there is a need for african hydrological scientists to make substantial contributions because their research is already grounded in applications linked to societal needs hughes et al 2015 a large number of rainfall runoff modelling structures are currently available but they differ in the degree of details of the description of processes the manner in which processes are conceptualized the requirements for input data and the possible spatial and temporal resolution tshimanga 2012 generally a choice has to be made between an event or continuous model a lumped or distributed model and a deterministic or stochastic model given little requirement on input data conceptual lumped rainfall runoff models have an advantage for hydrological application in the context of data scarce regions tegegne et al 2017 such as northern cameroon they are also usually simple and relatively easy to use in addition several studies e g skaugen et al 2015 munoz et al 2016 tegegne et al 2017 parra et al 2018 have shown that conceptual models can be a reliable alternative for prediction in poorly gauged catchments with limited hydrological information despite the recent advancements in developing hydrological models due to the actual level of knowledge of the physical processes of the hydrological system and the computational advances of the last years hydrological modeling outputs are subject to uncertainty resulting from different sources of errors which are generally grouped into three categories input data error model parameters error and model structural errors liu and gupta 2007 therefore a realistic assessment of the uncertainty in model predictions is important for science based decision making refsgaard et al 2006 2017 as well as to direct the research towards model structural improvements and uncertainty reduction this research thematic constitutes one of the three main targets of the research activity of the new science decade of iahs panta rhei 2013 2022 montanari et al 2013 and has been identified by the community process in 2018 as one of the twenty three 23 unsolved problems in hydrology bloschl et al 2019 sensitivity analysis sa and parameter identifiability are valuable steps if the model is to be used effectively and responsibly in any decision making process song et al 2015 they play crucial roles in model parameterization calibration optimization and uncertainty quantification and reduction guse et al 2020 norton 2015 saltelli and annoni 2010 refsgaard et al 2007 saltelli et al 2006 the former provides insights on how variations in the uncertain parameters map onto variations of the performance metric that measures the model fit while the second assesses how precisely the values for a model parameter can be identified reliable hydrological model simulations require that model parameters are precisely identified so that they could reliably represent the associated hydrological processes wagener et al 2003 shin et al 2015 in constraining model parameters to small ranges high parameter identifiability is achieved therefore equifinality is reduced since the impact of the different parameter values within this small range is low abebe et al 2010 cibin et al 2014 guse et al 2020 the objective of this study is to establish a rainfall runoff model that is fit in the context of hydro climate characteristics of the upper benue river basin ubrb northern cameroon that can be used to improve understanding of environmental dynamics to manage all the water resources issues and support policy decision of water resources management in this basin the paper applies a sa and parameter identifiability approaches using multiple performance criteria in order to reduce the parameter space and constrain model parameters to small ranges this will therefore help to quantify and reduce uncertainties on model predictions arising from both model structure and model parameters errors as well as to enhance the model performance this paper is organized as follows the study area and hydro meteorological data are introduced in section 2 the materials and methods are presented in section 3 in section 4 we present and discuss the obtained results while the summary and conclusions are provided in section 5 2 study area and data 2 1 the study area the upper benue river basin ubrb is framed between latitudes 7 n and 11 n and longitudes 12 e and 16 e thus representing a drainage area of 66 000 k m 2 fig 1 and generates an annual flow volume of about 10 200 m m 3 at the garoua outlet it is the second largest river in cameroon and a major tributary of the niger river basin nrb the latter is known as the third longest river in africa after the nile and congo rivers olivry et al 2005 this basin is seen as a key asset in the region as it provides potentials for development of water resources services that include hydropower navigation and irrigation it is the only perennial river in northern cameroon and the neighboring areas where most of the rivers are seasonal given the potential of the basin to sustain socio economic activities it has seen the establishment of development projects including industrial farms for irrigated rice sugar cane cotton and vegetable alongside with the traditional sorghum maize and millet there is also an ongoing project in the lagdo dam which aims to increase his hydropower and irrigation capacity in order to supply electricity to other countries from the dam including the chad republic the northern nigeria and part of the central african republic irap 2015 this basin experienced some water related disaster that include high hydrological variability with implication on water shortage flood and drought hazards molua and lambi 2006 sighomnou et al 2013 decreased trend in annual precipitation and increased trend in annual air temperature cheo et al 2013 ar√©touyap et al 2014 dassou et al 2016 and increased of drought magnitude and intensity under changing environmental conditions guenang and mkankam 2014 oguntunde et al 2018 the ubrb takes its source from the adamawa plateau and is characterized by a tropical humid climate with two distinctive seasons including a dry and hot season stretching from november to april and a wet and cooler season from may to october during which rainfall occurs the basin is steep with the elevation range between 220 to 2 260 m a s l characterized by major hills including adamawa plateau alantika and mandara mountains dassou et al 2016 it is a unimodal rainfall region see fig 2 a with mean annual rainfall varies from over 1500 m m y 1 in the head sub catchment highland of the adamawa plateau to less than 600 m m y 1 around lake chad molua and lambi 2006 in contradiction to rainfall annual temperature increases gradually from the south to the north annual potential evapotranspiration pet has a similar pattern than that of the temperature given that the two variables are strongly correlated kamga 2001 fig 2b also shows that the maximum of pet is obtained in march and minimum in august the land cover is dominated by sudan and sahel savannah in the northern part of the catchment and high guinea savannah in the southern part okolle et al 2016 2 2 hydro climatological data daily measured precipitation recorded at the weather stations located in the basin and neighboring areas and daily pet computed with penman formula penman 1948 provided by the direction of the national meteorology of cameroon dnm were used in this study as input for the hydrological model table 1 indicates the names geographical positions latitude and longitude altitudes and the period of record of the rainfall data data quality assessment shows that only one station maroua agro has a percentage of missing values of 3 5 whereas the remaining stations account less than 1 missing values and five of the observed stations have no missing values due to the low population and economic development level in the basin there are only four full meteorological stations ngaound√©r√© garoua ka√©l√© and maroua where full data are available to compute pet rainfall data of some of these stations were successfully used as input to calibrate the yates hydrological model in the ubrb kamga 2001 to classify cameroon into different climatic zones penlap et al 2004 to investigate the onset retreat and length of the rainy season and drought occurrence over cameroon guenang and mkankam 2012 2014 to examine the spatial and temporal variability of the mean annual precipitation in the northern cameroon dassou et al 2016 and for initial calibration of the hbv light in the ubrb nonki et al 2019 daily streamflow time series for three 03 monitoring stations buffle noir garoua and riao located in the basin with different record periods were obtained from the hydrosciences montpellier syst√®me d informations environnementales database boyer et al 2006 sierem http hydrosciences fr sierem table 2 gives the physiographic and hydrological characteristics of the available streamflow gauging sites in the ubrb considered here as sub catchments as well as data quality analysis the streamflow data of riao gauging station were successfully used by kamga 2001 to investigate the performance of yates hydrological model in the ubrb 3 materials and methods 3 1 the hbv light model the hydrologiska byr√•ns vattenavdelning hbv model was originally developed by the water balance section of the swedish meteorological and hydrological institute smhi to assist hydropower operations in the 1970s bergstrom and forman 1973 the hbv model was chosen due to the relatively low demand for input data and the unexcessive number of free model parameters compared with other models rusli et al 2015 during the last few decades the model has proved flexibility and robustness in solving water resources problems and it is used for a broad range of applications in different versions in many studies and projects in the world bergstrom 2006 additionally in the west african context the hbv model was also found to be suitable in simulating discharge and for global change impact studies cornelissen et al 2013 pomeon et al 2017 nonki et al 2019 kwakye and bardossy 2020 it s a lumped and conceptual model working at daily time steps and simulating discharges using daily precipitation and pet as input the three main hydrological processes accounted for in the hbv model include snow and snow cover soil moisture and evaporation and groundwater and response processes represented by two mains reservoirs since the study catchment is snow free the snow routine was not considered table 3 gives the main components of the hydrological processes the parameters designed to represent them in the hbv model and their ranges selected based on the existing studies seibert et al 2000 seibert and vis 2012 aghakouchak and habib 2010 the hbv light model seibert 2005 used here has identical structure than hbv model with two small changes the firstly is inclusion of a spin up period rather than requiring prescribed initial states and secondly the maxbas routing parameter can assume non integer values fig 3 shows the schematic view of different processes that occurs in the hbv light model the average value of input data over a catchment was computed using the arithmetical mean method rakhecha and singh 2009 as shown in eq 1 this method was chosen due to its simplicity to compute average mean rainfall compared to other existing methods such as thiessen polygon and isohyetal method additionally balany 2011 explored the behavior of the three methods of obtaining catchment rainfall and found that no method is consistently superior 1 p a v g 1 n i 1 n p i where p a v g is is the average of the climate variable p over the catchment area for a given time period n is the number of stations within the catchment p i is the value of the considering climate variable at station i 3 2 sensitivity analysis in this step it was investigated which model parameter most affects the hydrological simulations for this task we used the local sa method especially the one factor at time oat method widely applied in different sa studies abebe et al 2010 rusli et al 2015 and highly recommended by pianosi et al 2016 prior to the sa the model was first calibrated using multi objective functions and the best parameter set that reproduces the streamflow well in this catchment was obtained by using the random numbers from a uniform distribution within the given ranges for each parameter see table 3 we generated 1000 values of each model parameter and the model was run by varying one parameter while keeping the other parameters constant and observe the results for five different objective functions the absolute percent bias pbias zhang et al 2011 the ratio between root mean square error rmse and standard deviation of observed data stdevobs rsr moriasi et al 2007 the pearson correlation coefficient r wilcox 2011 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 table 4 gives the formulation of these performance criteria the relationship between performance criteria and part of hydrograph as well as hydrological components a parameter is identified as influential or non influential if change in its value affects the performance criteria or not the non influential parameters can be kept constant thus used to reduce the number of parameters to be calibrated in the model 3 3 parameter identifiability in this step it was investigated which parameter values lead to good model performance to identify appropriate model parameter values typically a large number of model simulations with different parameter combinations is carried out and analyzed according to their impact on performance criteria guse et al 2020 for this the monte carlo mc method robert and casella 2013 aghakouchak et al 2013 was used it is the strategy of choice because it is more general and requires fewer assumptions than other methods mishra 2009 fifty thousand 50 000 parameter sets were generated using the random numbers from a uniform distribution within the given ranges for each parameter the model was run for each parameter set and the simulations were screened into behavioural and non behavioural parameter sets using a threshold value see table 4 for very good simulations of each of the five performance criteria mentioned above the parameter is then considered as well or ill identified in the model structure if it gives very good simulations within a small or wide range of variations respectively the more the model parameter ranges are reduced the more precisely a parameter is identified this also reduces the impact of equifinality and thus reduces the uncertainty in selecting adequate parameter values shin et al 2015 it can also be qualitatively assessed by plotting each performance criterion vertical axis against the model parameter values horizontal axis in which for a well defined parameter the upper boundary should have a distinct peak while in ill defined parameters the upper boundary will have a broad plateau uhlenbrook et al 1999 3 4 optimal calibration and model performance assessment in this stage the model parameters identified as non influential to the model outputs are kept constant based on the lower and upper limits of the 95 confidence intervals for the very good simulations obtained during the parameter identifiability analysis 50 000 parameter sets were derived using the mc method the model was run for each parameter set and the best parameters set was then obtained by optimizing the different objectives functions mentioned above to assess the model performance for the ubrb with optimized parameters derived from recalibration graphical and statistical techniques have been used asce 1993 legates and mccabe 1999 the graphical techniques include hydro graphs used to identify the differences in timing and magnitude of peak flows model bias and shape of the curves of recession asce 1993 and flow duration curves that can illustrate how well the model reproduces the frequency of measured daily flows throughout the calibration and validation periods leboutillier and waylen 1993 the statistical techniques include the five performance criteria mentioned above more details and descriptions of those statistical techniques can be found in asce 1993 legates and mccabe 1999 moriasi et al 2007 gupta et al 2009 while table 5 gives their interpretation of some of them 4 results and discussion 4 1 individual sensitivity analysis fig 4 shows the individual parameter sa results for the five statistical performance measures at the three gauging stations used in this study namely garoua riao and buffle noir in general all the soil and evaporative routine parameters fc beta and lp and the base of the unit hydrograph function maxbas were the most influential model parameters to the different hydrological components of the model output despite the fact that the degree of sensitivity of each parameter varies with both the selected performance criterion and the gauging station this result is not surprising given the assumption that from the model structure formulation fc lp and beta are the parameters that control the water filling the soil infiltration water loss evapotranspiration and water runoff thus they influence all the hydrological components and the entire hydrograph of this watershed the interflow routing rate constant parameter k1 is an influential model parameter to all the different hydrological components and the entire hydrograph of this watershed except the overall volume error given by the pbias in the model structure k1 is the parameter that controls the fast interflow its influence on the watershed response is through modification of the shape of the outflow hydrograph at the watershed outlet and therefore it has a negligible effect with respect to the overall volume error this result highlights the use of multiple performance criteria because the group of sensitive parameters is related to the selected performance criterion abebe et al 2010 zelelew and alfredsen 2012 the individual sa also revealed that four parameters that controlled the groundwater and response routine namely k0 k2 uzl and perc did not influence the streamflow generation by the hbv light model in the different outlets of the ubrb this observation is not surprising given the physiographic conditions sandy soil drier conditions and less vegetation of the watershed and highlights the importance of surface and subsurface flows within the basin these four parameters will then take a constant value during the model recalibration this will help to reduce the parameter space the interaction between model parameters save time and computing resources for model calibration and therefore limiting model prediction uncertainties van werkhoven et al 2009 abebe et al 2010 zelelew and alfredsen 2012 wu et al 2014 4 2 parameter identifiability in this stage the model parameters were sampled simultaneously and 50 000 of model runs were conducted and screened into behavioural and non behavioural parameter sets considering the threshold value of each performance criterion above fig 5 shows the boxplot for the behavioural parameter sets according to different statistical criteria for the three outlets of the ubrb in general the soil moisture and evaporation routine parameters fc beta and lp were precisely constrained by contrasting all the five performance criteria used in this study compared to other parameters for the five parameters of the groundwater and response routine no improvement in the parameter value identification was detected for the pbias r and kge selected performance criteria while the interflow routing rate constant parameter k1 is constrained by contrasting the rsr and nse selected performance criteria this result highlights the fact that the identification of behavioural parameter values strongly depends on the selected performance criteria as found in the previous studies wagener et al 2003 pfannerstill et al 2014 guse et al 2020 this figure also shows that four of the five parameters that controlled the groundwater and response routine processes k0 k2 uzl and perc are not well identified in the hbv light model structure compared to the individual sa results we concluded that the non influential parameters on the model outputs are also the non identifiable parameters in the model structure this highlights the fact that the streamflow generation by the hbv light model in this watershed is not influenced by the fast flow the baseflow and the percolation processes this result reinforced our idea to keep those parameters constant during the model recalibration because the calibration of non identifiable parameters is difficult as they can lead to equifinality of parameters cibin et al 2010 4 3 implications of the parameter uncertainties to the model predictions figs 6 and 7 show the results of the model predictions based on the 95 confidence intervals for the acceptable simulations during the calibration and validation periods respectively these results reveal that the simulations show a less evenly distributed band of uncertainty around the observed streamflow in all the gauging stations within the basin area the best simulation as well as the observed streamflow lie within the uncertainty band of model predictions from low to high flows some discrepancies are noticed for the buffle noir outlet station where the high flows of the observed streamflow lie outside the uncertainty band this difference can be explained by the fact that the buffle noir outlet is located in an area where the whole basin has a very clear torrential character therefore each tornado or heavy rainfall gives rise to a separate peak flood these findings give the merit to the monte carlo procedure in calibrating optimizing and predicting uncertainties in hydrological models because in this method the interactions between model parameters are implicitly taken into account seibert 1997 steele dunne et al 2008 4 4 optimal calibration and model performance results figs 8 and 9 illustrate the model performance using daily observed and simulated hydrographs as well as the flow duration curves during the model recalibration and validation periods at the three gage stations within the basin garoua riao and buffle noir the model captures reasonably well the timing and magnitude of high and low flows although some bias still exists in different sub catchments the flow duration curves also show that the model reproduces the low flows more accurately than the high flows series relationship between measured and modeled streamflow shows a strong correlation see fig 10 indicating good model performance r 0 92 and r 0 82 at different gauging sites during the calibration and validation stages respectively the model also represents the seasonality of hydrological regime well with a maximum obtained in september although some significant differences in computing high flow series during the validation stage see fig 11 where we can note an overestimation of monthly streamflow specifically in september table 6 gives a statistical summary of the model performance for the calibration and validation periods at all control stations the model slightly overestimates the total runoff volume during the calibration period with an absolute pbias less than 4 while there is an underestimation of the total runoff volume during the validation period likewise table 6 presents the nse for daily streamflow ranging from 0 76 0 89 for the calibration period and 0 68 0 81 for the validation period indicating good model performance compared to the table 5 given by moriasi et al 2007 the model performance varies from good to very good this result is reinforced by the kge ranging from 0 82 0 92 and 0 71 0 83 obtained during the calibration and validation periods respectively the worst and the best simulations are obtained in the buffle noir and garoua stations respectively the result was expected because at the station of the buffle noir the basin has a very clear torrential character the flow variations are very sudden each tornado or heavy rainfall gives rise to a distinct flood peak which can last less than a day this is the reason why the hydrograph of the flows in the garoua and riao stations during the rainy season is much less serrated than in the buffle noir figs 8 and 9 the rsr ranges from 0 33 to 0 49 and 0 43 to 0 58 for calibration and validation stages respectively this reinforced the greater ability of the model to simulate the hydrological characteristics of the basin in general the model performed better during the calibration stage than in the validation stage and also more accurate in reproducing the flows in downstream stations garoua than upstream stations riao as shown by the performance criteria despite the good performance of the model errors could be attributed to the uncertainty in estimating measured streamflow and the average climatology data used for the catchment as well as the complex hydrological characteristics of the basin topography land use and size of catchments we also notice here that by contrasting the model parameters in a small range and keeping the non influential parameters in a constant value the model performance is improved during the model recalibration for example in the buffle noir gauging station the values of pbias and kge obtained during the initial calibration were 11 16 and 0 76 respectively while during the model recalibration these performance criteria were significantly improved with the obtained values of 1 82 and 0 82 respectively this result is in agreement with previous studies yen et al 2014 pfannerstill et al 2017 guse et al 2020 5 summary and conclusion the successful application of hydrological models for water resource management of the catchment mostly depends on the quantification and reduction of uncertainties arising from both model structure and model parameters identification of influential and non influential model parameters controlling the model response variations as well as the parameter identifiability analysis are valuable approaches for reducing the model parameter dimension and limiting prediction uncertainty while maintaining a high quality solution for model calibration this study focused on the optimization and the performance evaluation of the hbv light hydrological model in the ubrb for this task a detailed sa of the model parameter to the model response was performed by using one factor at time oat method while the monte carlo procedure was implemented for model calibration and parameter identifiability analysis using different objective functions the results showed that the soil and evaporation routine parameters fc Œ≤ and lp in addition with the recession coefficient k1 and the transformation routine parameter maxbas are the most or less influential parameters of the hbv light model to the different hydrological components in the ubrb thus other parameters k0 k2 perc and uzl can be kept constant during the calibration of the model this can reduce the interaction between model parameters time consuming for model calibration and therefore limiting model prediction uncertainties the most or less influential parameters to the model response are also found to be more or less well defined parameters in the model structure the implications of the parameter uncertainties to the model response revealed that the best simulation as well as the measured streamflow lies inside within the narrow band of 95 uncertainty for the behavioural simulations indicating the insignificant implications of the model parameters uncertainties to the model predictions a result that highlights the merit of the monte carlo procedure in calibrating and predicting uncertainties in model simulations the recalibration of the model based on the lower and upper limits of the confidence interval of the influential parameters showed that the optimized model parameters highly performed the model in different sub catchments of the ubrb during the calibration and validation stages with the model performance that varies from good to very good although some errors in simulating peak flows therefore the hbv light hydrological model with his set of optimized model parameters can be used as a tool by the decision makers water planners and scientific community to better manage the water resources in the ubrb to predict extreme events such as floods and droughts and to address the future challenge on water resources and hydropower potential under climate change scenarios our findings can assist the global hydrological and hbv light modeling communities in limiting prediction uncertainty providing more enhanced calibrations at lower

water resources issues and support policy decision of water resources management in this basin the paper applies a sa and parameter identifiability approaches using multiple performance criteria in order to reduce the parameter space and constrain model parameters to small ranges this will therefore help to quantify and reduce uncertainties on model predictions arising from both model structure and model parameters errors as well as to enhance the model performance this paper is organized as follows the study area and hydro meteorological data are introduced in section 2 the materials and methods are presented in section 3 in section 4 we present and discuss the obtained results while the summary and conclusions are provided in section 5 2 study area and data 2 1 the study area the upper benue river basin ubrb is framed between latitudes 7 n and 11 n and longitudes 12 e and 16 e thus representing a drainage area of 66 000 k m 2 fig 1 and generates an annual flow volume of about 10 200 m m 3 at the garoua outlet it is the second largest river in cameroon and a major tributary of the niger river basin nrb the latter is known as the third longest river in africa after the nile and congo rivers olivry et al 2005 this basin is seen as a key asset in the region as it provides potentials for development of water resources services that include hydropower navigation and irrigation it is the only perennial river in northern cameroon and the neighboring areas where most of the rivers are seasonal given the potential of the basin to sustain socio economic activities it has seen the establishment of development projects including industrial farms for irrigated rice sugar cane cotton and vegetable alongside with the traditional sorghum maize and millet there is also an ongoing project in the lagdo dam which aims to increase his hydropower and irrigation capacity in order to supply electricity to other countries from the dam including the chad republic the northern nigeria and part of the central african republic irap 2015 this basin experienced some water related disaster that include high hydrological variability with implication on water shortage flood and drought hazards molua and lambi 2006 sighomnou et al 2013 decreased trend in annual precipitation and increased trend in annual air temperature cheo et al 2013 ar√©touyap et al 2014 dassou et al 2016 and increased of drought magnitude and intensity under changing environmental conditions guenang and mkankam 2014 oguntunde et al 2018 the ubrb takes its source from the adamawa plateau and is characterized by a tropical humid climate with two distinctive seasons including a dry and hot season stretching from november to april and a wet and cooler season from may to october during which rainfall occurs the basin is steep with the elevation range between 220 to 2 260 m a s l characterized by major hills including adamawa plateau alantika and mandara mountains dassou et al 2016 it is a unimodal rainfall region see fig 2 a with mean annual rainfall varies from over 1500 m m y 1 in the head sub catchment highland of the adamawa plateau to less than 600 m m y 1 around lake chad molua and lambi 2006 in contradiction to rainfall annual temperature increases gradually from the south to the north annual potential evapotranspiration pet has a similar pattern than that of the temperature given that the two variables are strongly correlated kamga 2001 fig 2b also shows that the maximum of pet is obtained in march and minimum in august the land cover is dominated by sudan and sahel savannah in the northern part of the catchment and high guinea savannah in the southern part okolle et al 2016 2 2 hydro climatological data daily measured precipitation recorded at the weather stations located in the basin and neighboring areas and daily pet computed with penman formula penman 1948 provided by the direction of the national meteorology of cameroon dnm were used in this study as input for the hydrological model table 1 indicates the names geographical positions latitude and longitude altitudes and the period of record of the rainfall data data quality assessment shows that only one station maroua agro has a percentage of missing values of 3 5 whereas the remaining stations account less than 1 missing values and five of the observed stations have no missing values due to the low population and economic development level in the basin there are only four full meteorological stations ngaound√©r√© garoua ka√©l√© and maroua where full data are available to compute pet rainfall data of some of these stations were successfully used as input to calibrate the yates hydrological model in the ubrb kamga 2001 to classify cameroon into different climatic zones penlap et al 2004 to investigate the onset retreat and length of the rainy season and drought occurrence over cameroon guenang and mkankam 2012 2014 to examine the spatial and temporal variability of the mean annual precipitation in the northern cameroon dassou et al 2016 and for initial calibration of the hbv light in the ubrb nonki et al 2019 daily streamflow time series for three 03 monitoring stations buffle noir garoua and riao located in the basin with different record periods were obtained from the hydrosciences montpellier syst√®me d informations environnementales database boyer et al 2006 sierem http hydrosciences fr sierem table 2 gives the physiographic and hydrological characteristics of the available streamflow gauging sites in the ubrb considered here as sub catchments as well as data quality analysis the streamflow data of riao gauging station were successfully used by kamga 2001 to investigate the performance of yates hydrological model in the ubrb 3 materials and methods 3 1 the hbv light model the hydrologiska byr√•ns vattenavdelning hbv model was originally developed by the water balance section of the swedish meteorological and hydrological institute smhi to assist hydropower operations in the 1970s bergstrom and forman 1973 the hbv model was chosen due to the relatively low demand for input data and the unexcessive number of free model parameters compared with other models rusli et al 2015 during the last few decades the model has proved flexibility and robustness in solving water resources problems and it is used for a broad range of applications in different versions in many studies and projects in the world bergstrom 2006 additionally in the west african context the hbv model was also found to be suitable in simulating discharge and for global change impact studies cornelissen et al 2013 pomeon et al 2017 nonki et al 2019 kwakye and bardossy 2020 it s a lumped and conceptual model working at daily time steps and simulating discharges using daily precipitation and pet as input the three main hydrological processes accounted for in the hbv model include snow and snow cover soil moisture and evaporation and groundwater and response processes represented by two mains reservoirs since the study catchment is snow free the snow routine was not considered table 3 gives the main components of the hydrological processes the parameters designed to represent them in the hbv model and their ranges selected based on the existing studies seibert et al 2000 seibert and vis 2012 aghakouchak and habib 2010 the hbv light model seibert 2005 used here has identical structure than hbv model with two small changes the firstly is inclusion of a spin up period rather than requiring prescribed initial states and secondly the maxbas routing parameter can assume non integer values fig 3 shows the schematic view of different processes that occurs in the hbv light model the average value of input data over a catchment was computed using the arithmetical mean method rakhecha and singh 2009 as shown in eq 1 this method was chosen due to its simplicity to compute average mean rainfall compared to other existing methods such as thiessen polygon and isohyetal method additionally balany 2011 explored the behavior of the three methods of obtaining catchment rainfall and found that no method is consistently superior 1 p a v g 1 n i 1 n p i where p a v g is is the average of the climate variable p over the catchment area for a given time period n is the number of stations within the catchment p i is the value of the considering climate variable at station i 3 2 sensitivity analysis in this step it was investigated which model parameter most affects the hydrological simulations for this task we used the local sa method especially the one factor at time oat method widely applied in different sa studies abebe et al 2010 rusli et al 2015 and highly recommended by pianosi et al 2016 prior to the sa the model was first calibrated using multi objective functions and the best parameter set that reproduces the streamflow well in this catchment was obtained by using the random numbers from a uniform distribution within the given ranges for each parameter see table 3 we generated 1000 values of each model parameter and the model was run by varying one parameter while keeping the other parameters constant and observe the results for five different objective functions the absolute percent bias pbias zhang et al 2011 the ratio between root mean square error rmse and standard deviation of observed data stdevobs rsr moriasi et al 2007 the pearson correlation coefficient r wilcox 2011 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 table 4 gives the formulation of these performance criteria the relationship between performance criteria and part of hydrograph as well as hydrological components a parameter is identified as influential or non influential if change in its value affects the performance criteria or not the non influential parameters can be kept constant thus used to reduce the number of parameters to be calibrated in the model 3 3 parameter identifiability in this step it was investigated which parameter values lead to good model performance to identify appropriate model parameter values typically a large number of model simulations with different parameter combinations is carried out and analyzed according to their impact on performance criteria guse et al 2020 for this the monte carlo mc method robert and casella 2013 aghakouchak et al 2013 was used it is the strategy of choice because it is more general and requires fewer assumptions than other methods mishra 2009 fifty thousand 50 000 parameter sets were generated using the random numbers from a uniform distribution within the given ranges for each parameter the model was run for each parameter set and the simulations were screened into behavioural and non behavioural parameter sets using a threshold value see table 4 for very good simulations of each of the five performance criteria mentioned above the parameter is then considered as well or ill identified in the model structure if it gives very good simulations within a small or wide range of variations respectively the more the model parameter ranges are reduced the more precisely a parameter is identified this also reduces the impact of equifinality and thus reduces the uncertainty in selecting adequate parameter values shin et al 2015 it can also be qualitatively assessed by plotting each performance criterion vertical axis against the model parameter values horizontal axis in which for a well defined parameter the upper boundary should have a distinct peak while in ill defined parameters the upper boundary will have a broad plateau uhlenbrook et al 1999 3 4 optimal calibration and model performance assessment in this stage the model parameters identified as non influential to the model outputs are kept constant based on the lower and upper limits of the 95 confidence intervals for the very good simulations obtained during the parameter identifiability analysis 50 000 parameter sets were derived using the mc method the model was run for each parameter set and the best parameters set was then obtained by optimizing the different objectives functions mentioned above to assess the model performance for the ubrb with optimized parameters derived from recalibration graphical and statistical techniques have been used asce 1993 legates and mccabe 1999 the graphical techniques include hydro graphs used to identify the differences in timing and magnitude of peak flows model bias and shape of the curves of recession asce 1993 and flow duration curves that can illustrate how well the model reproduces the frequency of measured daily flows throughout the calibration and validation periods leboutillier and waylen 1993 the statistical techniques include the five performance criteria mentioned above more details and descriptions of those statistical techniques can be found in asce 1993 legates and mccabe 1999 moriasi et al 2007 gupta et al 2009 while table 5 gives their interpretation of some of them 4 results and discussion 4 1 individual sensitivity analysis fig 4 shows the individual parameter sa results for the five statistical performance measures at the three gauging stations used in this study namely garoua riao and buffle noir in general all the soil and evaporative routine parameters fc beta and lp and the base of the unit hydrograph function maxbas were the most influential model parameters to the different hydrological components of the model output despite the fact that the degree of sensitivity of each parameter varies with both the selected performance criterion and the gauging station this result is not surprising given the assumption that from the model structure formulation fc lp and beta are the parameters that control the water filling the soil infiltration water loss evapotranspiration and water runoff thus they influence all the hydrological components and the entire hydrograph of this watershed the interflow routing rate constant parameter k1 is an influential model parameter to all the different hydrological components and the entire hydrograph of this watershed except the overall volume error given by the pbias in the model structure k1 is the parameter that controls the fast interflow its influence on the watershed response is through modification of the shape of the outflow hydrograph at the watershed outlet and therefore it has a negligible effect with respect to the overall volume error this result highlights the use of multiple performance criteria because the group of sensitive parameters is related to the selected performance criterion abebe et al 2010 zelelew and alfredsen 2012 the individual sa also revealed that four parameters that controlled the groundwater and response routine namely k0 k2 uzl and perc did not influence the streamflow generation by the hbv light model in the different outlets of the ubrb this observation is not surprising given the physiographic conditions sandy soil drier conditions and less vegetation of the watershed and highlights the importance of surface and subsurface flows within the basin these four parameters will then take a constant value during the model recalibration this will help to reduce the parameter space the interaction between model parameters save time and computing resources for model calibration and therefore limiting model prediction uncertainties van werkhoven et al 2009 abebe et al 2010 zelelew and alfredsen 2012 wu et al 2014 4 2 parameter identifiability in this stage the model parameters were sampled simultaneously and 50 000 of model runs were conducted and screened into behavioural and non behavioural parameter sets considering the threshold value of each performance criterion above fig 5 shows the boxplot for the behavioural parameter sets according to different statistical criteria for the three outlets of the ubrb in general the soil moisture and evaporation routine parameters fc beta and lp were precisely constrained by contrasting all the five performance criteria used in this study compared to other parameters for the five parameters of the groundwater and response routine no improvement in the parameter value identification was detected for the pbias r and kge selected performance criteria while the interflow routing rate constant parameter k1 is constrained by contrasting the rsr and nse selected performance criteria this result highlights the fact that the identification of behavioural parameter values strongly depends on the selected performance criteria as found in the previous studies wagener et al 2003 pfannerstill et al 2014 guse et al 2020 this figure also shows that four of the five parameters that controlled the groundwater and response routine processes k0 k2 uzl and perc are not well identified in the hbv light model structure compared to the individual sa results we concluded that the non influential parameters on the model outputs are also the non identifiable parameters in the model structure this highlights the fact that the streamflow generation by the hbv light model in this watershed is not influenced by the fast flow the baseflow and the percolation processes this result reinforced our idea to keep those parameters constant during the model recalibration because the calibration of non identifiable parameters is difficult as they can lead to equifinality of parameters cibin et al 2010 4 3 implications of the parameter uncertainties to the model predictions figs 6 and 7 show the results of the model predictions based on the 95 confidence intervals for the acceptable simulations during the calibration and validation periods respectively these results reveal that the simulations show a less evenly distributed band of uncertainty around the observed streamflow in all the gauging stations within the basin area the best simulation as well as the observed streamflow lie within the uncertainty band of model predictions from low to high flows some discrepancies are noticed for the buffle noir outlet station where the high flows of the observed streamflow lie outside the uncertainty band this difference can be explained by the fact that the buffle noir outlet is located in an area where the whole basin has a very clear torrential character therefore each tornado or heavy rainfall gives rise to a separate peak flood these findings give the merit to the monte carlo procedure in calibrating optimizing and predicting uncertainties in hydrological models because in this method the interactions between model parameters are implicitly taken into account seibert 1997 steele dunne et al 2008 4 4 optimal calibration and model performance results figs 8 and 9 illustrate the model performance using daily observed and simulated hydrographs as well as the flow duration curves during the model recalibration and validation periods at the three gage stations within the basin garoua riao and buffle noir the model captures reasonably well the timing and magnitude of high and low flows although some bias still exists in different sub catchments the flow duration curves also show that the model reproduces the low flows more accurately than the high flows series relationship between measured and modeled streamflow shows a strong correlation see fig 10 indicating good model performance r 0 92 and r 0 82 at different gauging sites during the calibration and validation stages respectively the model also represents the seasonality of hydrological regime well with a maximum obtained in september although some significant differences in computing high flow series during the validation stage see fig 11 where we can note an overestimation of monthly streamflow specifically in september table 6 gives a statistical summary of the model performance for the calibration and validation periods at all control stations the model slightly overestimates the total runoff volume during the calibration period with an absolute pbias less than 4 while there is an underestimation of the total runoff volume during the validation period likewise table 6 presents the nse for daily streamflow ranging from 0 76 0 89 for the calibration period and 0 68 0 81 for the validation period indicating good model performance compared to the table 5 given by moriasi et al 2007 the model performance varies from good to very good this result is reinforced by the kge ranging from 0 82 0 92 and 0 71 0 83 obtained during the calibration and validation periods respectively the worst and the best simulations are obtained in the buffle noir and garoua stations respectively the result was expected because at the station of the buffle noir the basin has a very clear torrential character the flow variations are very sudden each tornado or heavy rainfall gives rise to a distinct flood peak which can last less than a day this is the reason why the hydrograph of the flows in the garoua and riao stations during the rainy season is much less serrated than in the buffle noir figs 8 and 9 the rsr ranges from 0 33 to 0 49 and 0 43 to 0 58 for calibration and validation stages respectively this reinforced the greater ability of the model to simulate the hydrological characteristics of the basin in general the model performed better during the calibration stage than in the validation stage and also more accurate in reproducing the flows in downstream stations garoua than upstream stations riao as shown by the performance criteria despite the good performance of the model errors could be attributed to the uncertainty in estimating measured streamflow and the average climatology data used for the catchment as well as the complex hydrological characteristics of the basin topography land use and size of catchments we also notice here that by contrasting the model parameters in a small range and keeping the non influential parameters in a constant value the model performance is improved during the model recalibration for example in the buffle noir gauging station the values of pbias and kge obtained during the initial calibration were 11 16 and 0 76 respectively while during the model recalibration these performance criteria were significantly improved with the obtained values of 1 82 and 0 82 respectively this result is in agreement with previous studies yen et al 2014 pfannerstill et al 2017 guse et al 2020 5 summary and conclusion the successful application of hydrological models for water resource management of the catchment mostly depends on the quantification and reduction of uncertainties arising from both model structure and model parameters identification of influential and non influential model parameters controlling the model response variations as well as the parameter identifiability analysis are valuable approaches for reducing the model parameter dimension and limiting prediction uncertainty while maintaining a high quality solution for model calibration this study focused on the optimization and the performance evaluation of the hbv light hydrological model in the ubrb for this task a detailed sa of the model parameter to the model response was performed by using one factor at time oat method while the monte carlo procedure was implemented for model calibration and parameter identifiability analysis using different objective functions the results showed that the soil and evaporation routine parameters fc Œ≤ and lp in addition with the recession coefficient k1 and the transformation routine parameter maxbas are the most or less influential parameters of the hbv light model to the different hydrological components in the ubrb thus other parameters k0 k2 perc and uzl can be kept constant during the calibration of the model this can reduce the interaction between model parameters time consuming for model calibration and therefore limiting model prediction uncertainties the most or less influential parameters to the model response are also found to be more or less well defined parameters in the model structure the implications of the parameter uncertainties to the model response revealed that the best simulation as well as the measured streamflow lies inside within the narrow band of 95 uncertainty for the behavioural simulations indicating the insignificant implications of the model parameters uncertainties to the model predictions a result that highlights the merit of the monte carlo procedure in calibrating and predicting uncertainties in model simulations the recalibration of the model based on the lower and upper limits of the confidence interval of the influential parameters showed that the optimized model parameters highly performed the model in different sub catchments of the ubrb during the calibration and validation stages with the model performance that varies from good to very good although some errors in simulating peak flows therefore the hbv light hydrological model with his set of optimized model parameters can be used as a tool by the decision makers water planners and scientific community to better manage the water resources in the ubrb to predict extreme events such as floods and droughts and to address the future challenge on water resources and hydropower potential under climate change scenarios our findings can assist the global hydrological and hbv light modeling communities in limiting prediction uncertainty providing more enhanced calibrations at lower

8196,study region the headwaters of tarim river study focus the tarim river basin is the largest arid inland river basin in china and recently only aksu yarkant and hotan rivers have natural hydraulic connections with it with climate changing the runoff from the headwaters of tarim river basin has undergone obvious changes that significantly affected downstream areas it is necessary to quantitatively attribute the impact of climate changes on runoff however the previous researches mostly focused on the aksu river basin and the attribution of runoff changes in the yarkant and hotan river basins was nearly blank this paper is dedicated to reveal the dominated climate factors for the runoff changes in all the three tributaries with large glacier coverage by combining the glacier enhanced swat model with the original and detrended precipitation and temperature inputs new hydrological insights for the region it was recognized that the rising temperature respectively contributed 94 and 66 to streamflow increases in the hotan and aksu river basins with slower glacier shrinking during 1965 2007 meanwhile the increased precipitation contributed 87 to streamflow increase in the yarkant river basin with a larger glacier area retreating ratio it is not as widely believed that the runoff changes in high glacierized basins are more correlated with temperature changes the respective variation amplitude of temperature and precipitation should be concerned in every catchment keywords climate change serial correlation streamflow changes variance correction approach tarim river basin 1 introduction high mountain asia is referred to as the asian water tower immerzeel et al 2020 which owns the greatest number of glaciers and largest ice volume outside of the polar regions farinotti et al 2019 nie et al 2021 yao et al 2012 the glacier meltwater modulates the discharge of many rivers originating from these regions which supports ecosystems and sustains for water use in the downstream nie et al 2021 pritchard 2019 with climate warming the glaciers are generally retreating and the runoff in the headwaters have undergone obvious changes that significantly affected the downstream areas especially for the arid region nie et al 2021 sorg et al 2012 unger shayesteh et al 2013 the tarim river basin therein is the largest arid inland river basin in china which feeds about 10 million people zhang et al 2009 and its source of water is mainly glacial snow meltwater accounting for 48 2 of the total water volume chen et al 2007 due to the one belt one road initiative achieving sustainable development in the tarim river basin where provides a passageway from asia to europe is becoming increasingly important chen et al 2016b nevertheless it became a representative of ecological fragility and environmental crisis caused by climate change and human activities in the past few years huang et al 2015 xue et al 2017 the tarim river basin is undergoing severe ecological degradation including drying of river channels li et al 2017 an increasing number of tributaries are losing their hydraulic connection with the mainstream of tarim river and disappearing in the taklimakan desert xu et al 2011c yang et al 2017 now only three major rivers the aksu yarkant and hotan rivers are still retain their natural hydraulic relationship with the mainstream gao et al 2010 xu et al 2011a and the proportions of annual discharge from the three rivers respectively accounted for 42 34 and 24 to the runoff of tarim river headwaters based on the observed outlet streamflow during 1961 2007 this indicates that the three river basins are all the dominated contributors for runoff of tarim river basin the aksu yarkant and hotan rivers respectively originate from the tienshan karakoram and kunlun mountains where is covered by large area of glaciers and with dominated snowmelt and glacier melt contributing chen et al 2019 based on the first and second china glacier inventory guo et al 2014 wu and li 2004 it can be realized that the glacier area coverage was similar in the three river basins however the glacier retreat ratios were different the glaciers in the tienshan mountains are more sensitive to climate change sorg et al 2012 while the glacier extent has been relative stable since the 1960s in the kunlun mountains and mass gains centered on west kunlun mountains lin et al 2017 shen et al 2020 that is often called the karakoram anomaly farinotti et al 2020 glacial change directly affects meltwater runoff and consequently the composition and seasonal variability of river flows descending from the mountains nie et al 2021 during the past fifty years the streamflow of headstreams in the tarim river basins has been increasing liu et al 2010 shen et al 2020 xu et al 2011a yang et al 2018 however the runoff of the three main tributaries presented different variations the annual runoff of aksu and yarkant rivers showed a significantly increasing trend while that of hotan river demonstrated a slight increase from 1961 to 2008 zhang and zuo 2017 however the scientific question of whether and to what extent the observed runoff increase can be attributed to rising temperature and or increased precipitation in the tarim river and its tributaries is still ambiguous the study related to the influence of climate change on the observed streamflow changes and the rigorous trend attribution mainly concentrated in the aksu river basin and the conclusions were not in unison due to the different using methods and models duethmann et al 2015 li et al 2016 2020 wang et al 2015 zhao et al 2015 for example wang et al 2015 and duethmann et al 2015 used distributed glacio hydrological models to simulate glacio hydrological processes in the kumirc catchment in tienshan mountain for the 1950s to 2010s although both concluded temperature change as the dominant contributor for streamflow change the quantitative contributions 57 and 90 were differences the attributed analysis referring to runoff changes of headwaters in yarkant and hotan river basins and even the whole tarim river basin was always qualitative based on the hydrometeorological data from observed stations chen et al 2009 li et al 2018 liu et al 2010 xu et al 2011a b especially for the west kunlun mountains with glacier anomaly the quantitative attribution of discharge changes was almost blank perhaps it is generally assumed that these streamflow changes in the high glacierized basins are likely dominated by temperature changes chen et al 2016a kundzewicz et al 2014 nie et al 2021 shen et al 2020 yet understanding the runoff response of glacierized catchments to climatic changes is particularly complex in the karakoram anomaly region given its varied discharge changes nie et al 2021 the anomalous glacier behavior in the karakoram and kunlun mountains is not only a curiosity in an epoch dominated by glacier retreat the glaciers importance for regional water supplies makes some of the unanswered scientific questions of great societal relevance farinotti et al 2020 therefore it is important to quantitatively and thoroughly explore the driver for river flow changes of the tributaries with different glacier changes in the tarim river basin the research has important implications for water resources development in this arid region and also for some similar river basins in which glacial melt forms an important part of the hydrological cycle therefore this study aims at assessing to what extent these streamflow trends of the three main tributaries of the tarim river basin can be attributed to changes in temperature or precipitation due to the complicated hydrological processes and scarce hydrometeorological observations in the high mountain areas fang et al 2018 liniger et al 1998 the attribution of streamflow changes in these regions are very difficult to be directly determined using statistical techniques instead distributed hydrological models are often the most preferred tool used to investigate and attribute long term variations in runoff unger shayesteh et al 2013 in this study the attribution analysis will be executed combining a simulation based approach using a hydrological model with an observation based statistical approach for constructing detrended climate scenarios which was successfully used to quantitatively separate the effects of temperature and precipitation changes on runoff bouraoui et al 2004 duethmann et al 2015 wang et al 2016a 2015 on the one hand for these glacierized mountain regions the distributed hydrological models are now widely updated with glacier modules for simulating glacier and snow hydrological processes in watersheds duethmann et al 2015 fang et al 2018 li et al 2020 luo et al 2013 lutz et al 2014 we will use a glacier enhanced swat soil water assessment tool model luo et al 2013 to investigate the impact of climate change on glacio hydrological processes this improved model can simulate the glacier dynamics by the glacier volume area scaling relationship and could reduce uncertainty in simulating glacial meltwater runoff luo et al 2013 it has been widely used in the tienshan pamir karakoram mountains for simulating the glacio hydrological processes gan et al 2015 luo et al 2018 wang et al 2016a 2015 zhang et al 2016 on the other hand before constructing the detrended climate scenarios the trends of observed precipitation and temperature data should be determined firstly the mann kendall mk trend test a non parametric statistical test is widely used in trend analysis studies aziz and burn 2006 onoz and bayazit 2012 yue et al 2002 yue and wang 2004 the null hypothesis in the mk technique requires the data series be independent and randomly ordered however time series of hydrometeorological variables show serial correlation i e a given value in time series is statistically dependent on previous values as shown for precipitation temperature and streamflow fan et al 2013 imbers et al 2014 khaliq et al 2009b sonali and kumar 2013 zhang et al 2014 application of mk technique to auto correlated data series can lead to an incorrect rejection of the null hypothesis of no trend whereas the null hypothesis is true li et al 2014 as a consequence serial correlations in hydrometeorological data series should not be neglected in long term trend analysis for the methods of trend analysis that can be used to remove serial correlation the variance correction vc approach is recommended as the proper trend detection technique khaliq et al 2009a stojkovic et al 2014 hence we will choose the vc approach for trend analysis before detrending the temperature and precipitation changes in this study the objective of this study is to systematically and thoroughly determine and quantize the dominated climate factors precipitation or temperature changes for streamflow changes in the main tributaries aksu yarkant and hotan rivers of the tarim river basin in the northwest china furthermore the dominant contributor to the changes in streamflow will be compared in the three different river basins with similar glacier area ratios but different retreating rates finally the zonal differentiation for the attribution of runoff changes in the glacierized basins will be identified based on the same set of methods and data 2 study area the tarim river basin is one of the world s largest endorheic drainage systems which is dominated by an arid inland climate with little precipitation and strong potential evapotranspiration chen et al 2016a yang et al 2015 as the largest inland river in china the tarim river spans 1321 km in length with a drainage area of about 1 million km2 the aksu yarkant and hotan rivers are the main tributaries draining into the main stem of tarim river recently the aksu river is the largest tributary in terms of runoff on the southern slope of tienshan mountain the kumaric and toxkan rivers are the two main branches in the upper reaches of the river the kumaric river originates from the northwest slope of the khantengri peak in the middle of the western tienshan mountains its upstream is mainly in kyrgyzstan the collecting area above the xiehela hydrological station is about 1 2 104 km2 and the trunk stream is 293 km long the glacier area is 3195 km2 based on the tienshan glacier dataset aizen et al 2007 and second china glacier inventory guo et al 2014 the catchment area of the toxkan river is about 1 8 104 km2 above the shaliguilk hydrological station and the mainstream is 457 km long these two rivers together form the aksu river with a source area of 32 461 km2 glacier area of about 3689 km2 and a total runoff of about 76 108 m3 the yarkant river is a representative river on the northern slope of the karakoram mountains kaqun station is the outlet of the river basin with a drainage area of 46 746 km2 the total number of glaciers glacier area and glacier area ratio is 2682 5528 km2 and 11 8 in this basin based on the second china glacier inventory respectively the streamflow is mostly contributed by glacier and snowmelt which mainly occurs during june to august wei et al 2019 the hotan river is formed by the confluent of the karakash river which originates from the northern slope of the karakoram mountains and the yurungkash river which originates from the northern slope of the kunlun mountains fig 1 wuluwati hydrological station is the flow control station at the outlet of karakash river it has a total length of 808 km and a basin area of 21 532 km2 there are large glacier groups in the source area with 2010 glaciers covering an area of 2169 5 km2 based on the second china glacier inventory the annual runoff of karakash river accounts for 51 of the annual runoff of the hotan river based on the observed outlet streamflow the controlled hydrographic station of the yurungkash river is tongguziluoke hydrographic station with a drainage area of 14 813 km2 there are 1334 glaciers in the basin covering a total area of 2954 km2 with a glacier coverage of 20 based on the second china glacier inventory the annual runoff of yurungkash river accounts for 49 of the annual runoff of hotan river the ratio of glacier area to basin area in the hotan river basin is 14 table 1 3 materials and methods 3 1 data description the dem land use soil data and glacier inventory in table 2 were used to delineate the study area into the hydrologic response units hrus sub basins and to generate tributaries and channel systems due to the scarce observed meteorological stations fig 1 the gridded aphrodite and pgmfd data were used as precipitation and temperature inputs table 2 the temperature and precipitation at high elevations were acquired by temperature and precipitation lapse rates tlaps and plaps based on wang et al 2016b the discharge data of hydrological stations and observed glacier area changes were used to calibrate and validate the models detailed descriptions of these data processing can be found in the previous studies wang et al 2016a b 3 2 trend detection methods in this study in order to remove the serial correlation in long term precipitation and temperature data series we used the vc approach this approach is the corrected mk test for the trend analysis of precipitation temperature and streamflow time series 3 2 1 mann kendall mk test the mk test gilbert 1987 hirsch et al 1982 1991 is a non parametric analysis that is widely used in hydrometeorological studies the test makes no assumptions regarding data distribution and can be used for incomplete seasonal data with serial dependence and linear or non linear trends the mk statistics s is computed as follows 1 s k 1 n 1 j k 1 n s g n x j x k s g n x j x k 1 x j x k 0 0 x j x k 0 1 x j x k 0 where x 1 x n are the hydrometeorological variables ordered chronologically and n is the number of points for analysis for large datasets n 40 the z test statistics is given as 2 z s 1 v a r s s 0 0 s 0 s 1 v a r s s 0 3 v a r s 1 18 n n 1 2 n 5 where var s is the variance of the data series the mk test rejects the null hypothesis if z zcr z zcr positive and negative z values indicate increasing and decreasing trends respectively 3 2 2 variance correction vc approach the vc approach was used to modify the mk test by removing serial correlation on the basis that n serially correlated data contain the same information as n n uncorrelated data using extensive monte carlo simulations yue et al 2002 demonstrated that the serial correlation in a time series does not alter the asymptotic normality and mean of the mk test statistic s however it changes the variance of s the existence of positive or negative serial correlation could accordingly increase or decrease the variance of s hamed and rao 1998 and yue and wang 2004 proposed the need for correcting the variance of s using an adequate sample size that reflects the effect of serial correlation on the variance of s the modified variance of s is given as 4 v a r s c f v a r s where var s is the variance of the mk test statistic s for the original sample data and cf is a correction factor as proposed by hamed and rao 1998 and yue and wang 2004 in this study the latter cf was used and is given as 5 c f 1 2 k 1 n 1 1 k n r k 6 r k 1 n k i 1 n k x i x x i k x 1 n i 1 n x i x 2 where rk is the lag k serial correlation coefficient of the data and x is the mean of the time series to judge if the data series are serially correlated the significance of rk at the significance level of Œ± 0 10 was assessed in the two tailed test based on the approximation 7 1 1 645 n k 1 n k r k 1 1 645 n k 1 n k if the lag k serial correlation is computed in eq 6 falls within the confidence interval given in eq 7 then the data are assumed to be serially independent otherwise the data are regarded as significantly serially correlated only time series consisting of a linear trend and a lag 1 autoregressive ar 1 process are explored which are commonly used in hydrology yue and pilon 2003 the approach works under the assumption of an ar 1 process when only r1 is considered 3 2 3 trend slope the sen s non parametric method gilbert 1987 sen 1968 was used to calculate the slope of data series using the following equation 8 Œ≤ median x j x k j k k j where Œ≤ is sen s slope x j x k are the hydrometeorological variables 3 3 glacier enhanced swat model swat is a physically based long term basin scale distributed hydrological model swat is widely used in the hydrological cycle and water resource management simulations arnold et al 2012 gassman et al 2007 luo et al 2013 developed a glacier module and integrated it into the swat model to realize simulating watershed glacio hydrological processes the detailed descriptions of the model are documented by luo et al 2013 the module treats each individual glacier as a hydrological response unit ghru each ghru is divided into ten elevation bands the glacier mass balance is simulated in each band the simulated glacier mass balance components include mass accumulation sublimation melting of ice and snow and refreezing of these melt waters the glacier mass balance is given as 9 d w g d t 1 f m s f where wg is the depth of water equivalent of ice in mm h2o m is the melt rate of ice in mm h2o day 1 f is the ratio of meltwater refreezing s is the sublimation rate of ice in mm h2o day 1 f is glacier accumulation rate in mm h2o day 1 and t is the time step in days the ice and snow melt is simulated using the degree day factor approach hock 2005 hock et al 2005 the glacier volume is calculated based on the total glacier mass balance and the glacier area is updated through the glacier volume area scaling relation chen and ohmura 1990 this relation is as follows 10 a g l a v g l a m 1 n where agla km2 and vgla m km2 are surface area and volume of the glacier respectively based on liu et al 2003 m is set at 40 and n at 1 35 in this study these values were derived from measured glacier data in northwest china the relationship between glacier volume and glacier area and depth of water equivalent of glacier mass is expressed as 11 v gla w g a g l a œÅ i where wg is the equivalent water depth of ice and œÅi is the bulk density of ice usually taken as 0 9 kg m 3 in this model the runoff in each hru ghru is split into four possible contributing factors rainfall runoff snow melt glacier melt and baseflow precipitation based runoff consists of surface runoff and lateral flow released from soil water storage generated from rainfall snow melt consists of snow meltwater released from snow storage the runoff from glacier melt encompasses all the melt generated in the glacierized area including the supraglacial snow melt ice melt and rainfall runoff on the ice surface baseflow is released from shallow and deep groundwater storage so precipitation and icemelt are the water inputs the total runoff in all hrus is summed to determine the runoff in the entire watershed the river discharge is routed to determine the loss via river channels the glacier enhanced swat model has been applied to several alpine watersheds in tienshan pamir karakoram mountains gan et al 2015 luo et al 2013 2018 ma et al 2015 wang et al 2016a b wang et al 2015 and it has been proven as a useful tool for simulating glacio hydrological processes the model calibration and validation were carried out from two aspects river discharge at hydrological stations and glacier area changes by trial and error method some sensitive parameters were acquired from previous studies conducted in the similar study area acceptable calibration and validation results are obtained after repeated trials the specifics of the procedure for parameter calibration are documented in wang et al 2016a the so called multi variable calibration and validation sorg et al 2014 the monthly streamflow data series for each gauge station was used for the calibration and validation optimization targets the glacier area and mass balance changes were also used to constrain the calibration process the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and percent bias pbias were used to evaluate the model performance during parameterization the modeling performance was rated using the method adopted by moriasi et al 2007 where 0 75 nse 1 0 suggests very good 0 65 nse 0 75 good 0 50 nse 0 65 satisfactory and nse 0 50 unsatisfactory simulation results also pbias 10 suggests very good 10 pbias 15 good 15 pbias 25 satisfactory and pbias 25 unsatisfactory simulation results 3 4 attribution based on original and detrended scenarios the attribution method used in this study was ever proposed by wang et al 2015 to investigate how changes in temperature and precipitation affect glacio hydrological processes combining the distributed glacier enhanced swat model with detrended climatic factors input the detrended approach has been elaborated in wang et al 2015 and wang et al 2016a in this study the improved detrended approach for climatic variables with significant trends was based on the vc trend analysis test at 0 05 significance level and then detrended temperature and precipitation data series were generated based on original temperature and precipitation t and p and detrended values t0 and p0 four climatic forcing scenarios table 3 were designated to reveal the climate change impacts on glacio hydrological processes in a given historical period typically t0 and p0 series scenario 4 were treated as the climatic background we compared and quantified the differences between the simulated changes in streamflow and attribute the impact of climate change on streamflow the overall trend due to both precipitation and temperature changes can be estimated from 1 the trend of the simulation with the original climate input time series scenario 1 minus 2 the simulation with the detrended climate input time series scenario 4 individually the overall trend due to precipitation changes can be estimated from 1 the trend of the simulation with the detrended temperature and the original precipitation input scenario 2 minus 2 the simulation with the detrended climate input time series scenario 4 the overall trend due to temperature changes can thus be estimated from 1 the trend of the simulation with the original temperature and the detrended precipitation input scenario 3 minus 2 the simulation with the detrended climate input time series scenario 4 4 results and discussion 4 1 model calibration and validation 4 1 1 streamflow based on the quality of observed streamflow we chose the corresponding periods as calibration and validation periods for different hydrological stations as shown in fig 2 the nse and pbias evaluation indices for the calibration and validation processes in the aksu yarkant and hotan river basins are listed in table 4 based on the rating criteria provided by moriasi et al 2007 for the calibration and validation stages nse 0 68 suggested that the model performed very good or good for hydrological stations in the hotan yarkant and kumaric river basins nse values were 0 7 and 0 62 in the shaliguilk hydrological station suggesting that the model performance in the toxkan river basin was good or satisfactory respectively pbias values also suggested very good or good model performances for most of the stations and satisfactory for tongguziluoke and shaliguilk hydrological stations only during the calibrated period hydrographs of simulated monthly streamflow at these hydrological stations fit well with the observed values and indicated that the simulated streamflow was reasonable fig 2 4 1 2 glacier area changes it can be seen from table 5 that the simulated glacier area changes in the tributaries of aksu yarkant and hotan river basins were close to the observed values for the hotan and yarkant river basins changes in the glacier area were calculated based on the first and second china glacier inventory in 1960s and 2000s and that of the aksu river basin was from both china glacier inventories and tienshan glacier dataset v 1 in 1970s and 2000s the calculation of glacier area changes were based on the area of each individual glacier existing in both the glacier inventories of two periods on the scale of basin the area of these glaciers in each glacier inventory was respectively added together and then the retreat rate was calculated by comparison on different glacier sizes the process for calculating glacier shrinking ratio is similar to that in catchment scaling the glacial retreat in the hotan river basin 1 4 was the slowest compared to that in yarkant and aksu river basins 8 7 and 4 5 moreover the area changes in glaciers with different sizes in the three river basins were assessed and presented in fig 3 in every size class the rates of simulated glacier area shrinkage were very similar to the observed values furthermore in the hotan river basin some glaciers in the size classes 5 50 km2 showed advanced rates that is explained as the karakoram anomaly farinotti et al 2020 our model could also simulate the advance of glaciers well 4 2 characteristic of streamflow and runoff components changes the simulated annual streamflow was compared with the observed values during 1965 2007 in the aksu yarkant and hotan river basins as shown in fig 4 the simulated streamflow in the three river basins all showed increasing trends and were fit to the observed streamflow based on the vc approach at a significance of 0 05 the annual streamflow increased non significantly by 1 6 108 and 1 7 108 m3 10 yr in the hotan and yarkant river basins and significantly by 3 3 108 m3 10 yr in the aksu river basin respectively as shown in table 6 seasonally spring or autumn streamflow in the hotan and yarkant river basins showed significant increasing trends while summer streamflow in the aksu river basin increased significantly the other seasons showed non significant increasing trends in the three river basins overall only the streamflow in the aksu river basin had a significant increasing trend from 1965 to 2007 and especially embodied in the wet season the runoff is composed of rainfall runoff snowmelt glacier melt and baseflow meanwhile the contributions of these components to total runoff were very different in the yarkant and aksu river basins the glacier melt had the dominant contribution about 48 and 43 56 for kumaric river and 21 for toxkan river respectively fig 5 these values are similar with that simulated by duethmann et al 2015 35 48 for kumaric river and 9 24 for toxkan river zhao et al 2015 53 6 for kumaric river yin et al 2017 51 6 for the yarkant river and fang et al 2018 based on different hydrological models in terms of the glacier melt components the contribution of the ice melt was 58 and it was much bigger than that of the supraglacial snowmelt in the yarkant river basin the contributions of ice melt and supraglacial snowmelt to the glacier melt were both nearly 40 in the other two river basins fig 6 in the hotan river basin the snowmelt was the dominant contributor to the runoff 37 and the glacier melt contributed only 25 to runoff fig 5 the contributions of runoff and glacier melt components varied widely in different river basins and the changes in every component were also very different the glacier melt and ice melt in the hotan and aksu river basins showed significant or non significant increasing trends respectively the yarkant river basin had non significant decreasing trends for both glacier and ice melt these complex and different variation for streamflow and runoff components in different river basins were determined by different climate factors and catchment characteristics in the following section the attribution of streamflow changes in the high glacierized aksu yarkant and hotan river basins during the past fifty years will be elaborated 4 3 attribution of streamflow changes 4 3 1 precipitation and temperature changes based on the detrended method the detrended precipitation and temperature series were generated using the detrended method based on the comparison of detrended and original values the changes in multi year average annual and monthly precipitation and temperature were quantified during the period 1965 2007 fig 7 for annual average precipitation obvious changes were detected mainly in the yarkant and aksu river basins where the annual average precipitation increased by 0 8 and 1 6 respectively on the monthly scale precipitation increased mainly in june and july in the yarkant river basin while in march and october in the aksu river basin however in the hotan river basin the precipitation only increased by 0 2 for annual average values and the increases occurred in april and may comparison of detrended annual average temperature with original values showed an increasing trend in all the three river basins the increases were more remarkable in the hotan and aksu river basins the annual average temperature was 0 43 and 0 36 c higher than the detrended temperature from 1965 to 2007 in these two basins the cumulative increase in the average annual temperature in the yarkant river basin was only 0 16 c on the monthly scale the warming mainly occurred in winter november to february in all the three river basins from june to september the original temperature was nearly 0 1 0 6 c higher than the detrended temperature in the hotan and aksu river basins at the same time there were no remarkable differences between the original and detrended temperature during these months in the yarkant river basin in any case the precipitation increased obviously in the yarkant and aksu river basins while the temperature rose significantly in the hotan and aksu river basins during 1965 2007 table 6 4 3 2 attribution of the effect of precipitation and temperature on streamflow changes based on the detrended method the streamflow changes calculated by comparing the detrended scenarios p0 t0 with original scenarios p t are shown in table 7 and fig 8 the annual streamflow from 1965 to 2007 increased by 4 6 1 2 and 4 2 in the aksu yarkant and hotan river basins respectively moreover these increases mainly occurred from june to september summer season when considering the contribution of the changes in precipitation to streamflow scenario 2 t0 p and scenario 4 t0 p0 were compared the increasing precipitation caused an increase in the streamflow by 1 6 1 and 0 2 in the aksu yarkant and hotan river basins respectively moreover due to the effect of precipitation changes the streamflow increased more obviously in july and august in the yarkant river basin while in may and june in the hotan and aksu river basins scenario 3 t p0 was compared with scenario 4 t0 p0 in order to quantify the effect of temperature rising on streamflow changes from 1965 to 2007 in the hotan and aksu river basins the effect of warmer temperature on the streamflow change was much more extensive the original annual streamflow was 4 and 3 higher than the detrended value in these two river basins and the increases mainly appeared in june july and september in the yarkant river basin the annual average streamflow was only 0 15 higher than the detrended value overall the rising temperature contributed by 94 and 66 to streamflow increase in the hotan and aksu river basins respectively meanwhile the increase of precipitation contributed 87 to streamflow increase in the yarkant river basin therefore temperature rising was the primary cause for streamflow increases in the hotan and aksu river basins with slower glacier shrinking which was in line with the previous findings related to the aksu river basin based on statistical approach or hydrological models duethmann et al 2015 kundzewicz et al 2014 shen et al 2018 nevertheless in the yarkant river basin with a larger glacier area retreat ratio precipitation changes were the dominant factor for increased streamflow there is some consistency with the previous view that the increasing rate of streamflow was nearly equal to the rate of increase in precipitation during the summer months over the karakoram mountains in recent years mukhopadhyay and khan 2014 4 3 3 contribution of glacier runoff changes on streamflow changes the differences in runoff components changes were the root cause of the variations in streamflow changes in different river basins comparing the detrended scenarios p0 t0 with original scenarios p t the changes in runoff components of every river basin are shown in figs 9 and 10 the total runoff changes were made up by the sum of changes in rainfall runoff snowmelt glacier melt and baseflow the contribution of changes in each runoff component to total runoff changes can be calculated as follows 12 f rr Œ¥ q rr Œ¥ q rr Œ¥ q sm Œ¥ q gm Œ¥ q bf 100 13 f sm Œ¥ q sm Œ¥ q rr Œ¥ q sm Œ¥ q gm Œ¥ q bf 100 14 f gm Œ¥ q gm Œ¥ q rr Œ¥ q sm Œ¥ q gm Œ¥ q bf 100 15 f bf Œ¥ q bf Œ¥ q rr Œ¥ q sm Œ¥ q gm Œ¥ q bf 100 where Œ¥ q rr Œ¥ q sm Œ¥ q gm and Œ¥ q bf represents the absolute value of changes in the mean rainfall runoff snowmelt glacier melt and baseflow over the years respectively frr fsm fgm and fbf represent the relative contributions of rainfall runoff snowmelt glacier melt and baseflow changes to the change of total runoff respectively these contributions of runoff components in the aksu yarkant and hotan river basins are shown in fig 9 in the aksu river basin enhanced glacier melt contributed 56 to increasing streamflow and was the dominant contributor fig 9 for one of the tributaries of the aksu river the kumaric river basin the contribution from increases in glacier melt to total runoff changes was 54 6 which is similar with 50 6 simulated by li et al 2020 and less than 56 85 by duethmann et al 2015 this may be due to the prescribed constant linear decrease rate when updating annual glacier area in duethmann et al 2015 which would lead to inaccuracy in estimating glacier mass balance glacier melt and its contribution to runoff as well li et al 2020 moreover the increase in glacier melt and ice melt was mainly caused by rising temperature figs 9 and 10 among other small contributors to the streamflow changes the increases in snowmelt and baseflow were mainly affected by increasing precipitation whereas the increased rainfall runoff was due to the rising temperature as a consequence in the aksu river basin with a small glacier retreat the increased streamflow was mainly contributed by glacier melt changes at the same time the warming temperature was the dominant factor for glacier changes and enhanced river discharge in the yarkant river basin the glacier melt changes were not the primary contributor for streamflow changes 27 although the glacier melt was the dominant contribution for total runoff 48 nevertheless the rainfall runoff changes contributed the most it can be seen from fig 9 that the increases in rainfall runoff were mainly due to increased precipitation so even in a river basin with a larger glacier retreating ratio the streamflow increases were mainly caused by the precipitation changes rather than the warming temperature which affected the changes in glacier melt and icemelt figs 9 and 10 in the hotan river basin the glacier melt only contributed 25 of the total runoff but changes in glacier melt were the primary contributor 49 for runoff changes during 1965 2007 comparing the detrended scenario 4 p0 t0 with original scenario 1 p t scenarios 2 p0 t scenarios 3 p t0 the glacier melt increased almost solely because of rising temperature fundamentally the glacier melt change was contributed by the increase in icemelt which was also merely due to temperature increases additionally the changes in rainfall runoff and baseflow are also mainly affected by rising temperatures which influenced precipitation patterns therefore even in the glacier stabilized hotan river basin the warming temperature was still the dominant factor for streamflow increasing the non significant precipitation increases had a minor impact on streamflow changes perhaps if the precipitation changed significantly the streamflow changes in the river basin with a stable glacier would mainly be affected by precipitation changes by comparing the results in the yarkant river basin with that in the hotan and aksu river basins we concluded that the changes in streamflow of river basins with intense glacier retreating are not necessarily mainly influenced by temperature changes and sensitive to the warming climate at the same time the river basins with stable glaciers may be more sensitive to rising temperature than precipitation changes the dominant factor for river discharge changes needs to be analyzed quantitatively based on the relative range and seasonality of temperature and precipitation changes the dominant increase in precipitation during the spring season and the warming temperature during winter would lead to the glaciers remained stable however the increased glacier meltwater due to rising temperature may be still the main contributor to the enhanced river flow when precipitation in summer is constant geographically it is widely considered that a dramatic uptrend in streamflow of highly glaciated basins are more correlated with temperature change and likely dominated by the rising temperature chen et al 2016a nie et al 2021 shen et al 2020 however our study indicates that it should not be taken for granted that glaciers and runoff in glacier stable basins are not sensitive to temperature rise and basins with significant glacial retreat are more affected by climate warming 4 4 uncertainties for the attribution methods in this study the attribution analysis of the impact of precipitation and temperature changes on streamflow changes in the glacierized river basins of the tarim river basin was executed by combining the constructing detrended climate scenarios with a glacial hydrological model these approaches would bring some uncertainties for the simulated results related to the attribution of glacier melt and runoff changes here we will mainly discuss the statistical trend test method and simulation method for glacier change we using 4 4 1 effect of serial correlation in precipitation and temperature data in this study we used the vc approach removing the serial correlation in variables to detect the trends in hydrometeorological data and realized that considering the serial correlation was necessary for trend analysis in this section we discuss the serial correlation in precipitation and temperature data and the effect of serial correlation on trend analysis to judge if the aphrodite precipitation and pgmfd temperature data were serially correlated the significance of the lag 1 serial correlation at Œ± 0 10 of the two tailed tests was determined using eqs 6 and 7 the serial correlation coefficients for aphrodite precipitation and pgmfd temperature grids are given in fig 11 overall the serial correlation in temperature especially for minimum temperature was much more significant than that in precipitation in the aksu yarkant and hotan river basins the results agree with the previous research findings yue and hashino 2003 there were significant serial correlations r 1 0 23 in annual precipitation for about 50 grids in the aksu river basin and nearly 20 grids in the other two river basins for maximum temperature only a few girds in the hotan and yarkant river basins and 50 grids in the aksu river basin had significant serial correlation however for minimum temperature the lag 1 serial correlation of nearly all grids in every river basin was significant therefore serial correlation in temperature especially for minimum temperature should be considered in order to quantify the effect of serial correlation on trend analysis the trends in aphrodite precipitation and pgmfd temperature grids individually tested by mk and vc methods are compared in fig 12 it can be seen that the number of grids with significant increasing or decreasing trends detected by vc approach was fewer than that by mk test p 0 05 due to the effect of serial correlation whether it was for precipitation or temperature in detail for aphrodite precipitation grids based on vc approach nearly all grids in the aksu river basin showed a non significant increasing or decreasing trend if tested by mk method the percentages of grids with significant trends were improved by 20 moreover some grids showed opposite trends based on the two different tests similarly the vc approach gave a significant increasing trend for most grids in the yarkant river basin but the number of significant grids was still fewer than that based on the mk test less than 10 of grids exhibited a significant increasing trend in the hotan river basin based on the vc test which was remarkably less than that based on the mk test 50 overall the presence of serial correlation made overestimating the significances of trends in precipitation and the effect of serial correlation in precipitation on the detection of the trend was quite apparent in the aksu and hotan river basins concerning pgmfd temperature grids it can be seen from fig 12 that the effect of serial correlation on the trend in temperature was much larger in the yarkant river basin than in the other two river basins based on mk test all pgmfd temperature grids in the three river basins showed a significant increasing trend for the maximum temperature the number of grids with significantly increasing trends under the mk test was 35 more than that under vc approach in the yarkant river basin however these differences of significance were fewer in the hotan and aksu river basins for the minimum temperature the detected results by mk and vc tests were very different especially for the hotan and yarkant river basins based on mk test almost all grids in all the three river basins showed a significant increase however only a few grids in the hotan and yarkant river basins increased significantly under vc approach also in the aksu river basin the number of grids with the significant increase tested by vc approach was nearly 50 less than that by mk test the differences in the significance of temperature trends detected under mk and vc tests were large from figs 11 and 12 it can be concluded that trend analysis by mk test could result in inconsistent conclusions whether considering the serial correlation or not positive serial correlation can lead to an overestimation of the trend and increase the variance of the mk statistic this is according to the point in yue et al 2002 moreover comparing with the simulated results of different detrended scenarios it can be found that even the opposing sign changes for streamflow were revealed in the yarkant river basin based on different trend analysis when detrending if mk and vc tests were respectively used to detect the trends in precipitation and temperature in the yarkant river basin and the detrended scenarios conducted were used to attribute the streamflow changes mk test suggested that the main contributor of the increases in streamflow of the yarkant river basin was the rise in temperature whereas vc approach attributed it to rise in precipitation fig 13 it is identified that temperature change was the main cause of the streamflow changes when the serial correlations of temperature and precipitation were ignored however when the serial correlations were removed in trend detection precipitation change became the main reason for streamflow changes it can be concluded that whether to consider the serial correlation may directly cause the opposite of the detecting results the effect of serial correlation on the attribution analysis was also show in the previous studies for the attribution analysis of streamflow changes in the kumaric river basin wang et al 2015 neglected serial correlations of precipitation temperature and streamflow data series while duethmann et al 2015 removed any such correlations using the trend free pre whitening tfpw technique although both concluded temperature change as the dominant contributor for streamflow change the quantitative results were different therefore the mk test for trend detection should be modified to prevent the detection of false trends when data have a significant serial correlation the approaches such as pre whitening pw tfpw vc and block bootstrap bbs are widely used in combination with the mk technique to remove the serial correlation beharry et al 2014 da silva et al 2015 hamed 2009 khaliq et al 2009a mohsin and gough 2010 salas et al 1980 sonali and kumar 2013 tabari et al 2015 while pw and tfpw approaches remove serial correlations in data series beforehand vc and block bootstrap modify the estimation of variation in the mk technique khaliq et al 2009a noted that while the modified mk test with pw and bbs has less power in the presence of serial correlation the tfpw approach is inappropriate in preserving the nominal level of significance moreover the power of tfpw mk is affected by the shape of the trend and the presence of non linear trends in autocorrelated series blain 2015 the vc approach is recommended as the proper trend detection technique used to remove serial correlation khaliq et al 2009a stojkovic et al 2014 so the vc approach used in our study could reduce some uncertainties from the serial correlation of precipitation and temperature data when doing the attribution analysis of runoff changes 4 4 2 method for simulating glacier area change the glacier simulation method in this study is based on the ghru to simulate the glacier mass balance and glacier morphology change the glacier mass balance was calculated by the degree day factor method and the glacier morphology was calculated by v a scaling relationship when simulating a single glacier based on sufficient observation data another method namely the energy balance method can be adopted for mass balance simulation which is also the method most consistent with the physical mechanism hock 2003 jansson et al 2003 however the degree day factor method is much more simplified and has good applicability in glacier simulation in the basin with scarce observed data kriegel et al 2013 wiltshire 2014 the degree of moraine cover and bare ice area have not been differentiated in this study which can be improved in the future for the simulation of glacier morphology the v a relationship is adopted to simulate glacier change which is based on empirical relation but has the basis of physical formula derivation bahr et al 2015 the v a scaling relationship is widely used in glacier hydrology studies hirabayashi et al 2010 this approach converts the calculated volume changes mass balance into changes in the glacier area however the glacier dynamics method can monitor the glacier morphology change comprehensively the glacier dynamics method can obtain the glacier thickness and the change of mass balance at a different elevation and reduce the uncertainty of the glacier dynamic simulation although the energy balance method combined with glacier dynamics is a leading edge method its extensive input requirements make its applicability in hydrological models at large watershed scales at the watershed scale the combination of degree day factor and v a scaling relationship brings great convenience to the hydrological simulation of glaciers several previous studies have also shown that it is a relatively reliable method lutz et al 2014 radiƒá et al 2008 zhao et al 2019 in the future remote sensing satellites and other methods may help to acquire more glacier observation data to combine glacier dynamic method with energy balance methods for simulating glacier mass balance and dynamic change it may lead to more accurately simulating the flow generation process in glacier basin attributing the influence of climate change on runoff change in snow and glacier melt dominated basins and revealing the primary factors for glacier stability 5 conclusions combining a glacio hydrological model with the original and detrended precipitation and temperature data inputs we quantitatively attributed the effect of precipitation and temperature changes on runoff increases of the three highly glacierized tributaries aksu yarkant and hotan rivers which are the only three headstreams recently having natural hydraulic connections with the tarim river our key findings are listed as follows 1 the significant serial correlation usually exists in the climatic series data especially for the temperature data therefore it is advisable to remove serial correlation in trend analysis in order to avoid the detection of false trends the vc approach considering removing serial correlation is more suitable for trend analysis in our study and could reduce some uncertainty from the attribution analysis 2 temperature rising was the primary cause for streamflow increases in the hotan and aksu river basins with slower glacier shrinking precipitation changes were the dominant factor for increasing streamflow in the yarkant river basin with a larger glacier area retreating ratio based on the original and detrended simulated results of the investigated catchments during 1965 2007 it was noted that the rising temperature contributed 94 and 66 to streamflow increases in the hotan and aksu river basins and changes in glacier melt were the primary contributor for streamflow changes 49 and 56 respectively in comparison the increase of precipitation contributed 87 to streamflow increase in the yarkant river basin and the rainfall runoff changes were the primary contributor for streamflow changes we can quantitatively recognize that it is not as widely believed that the changes in streamflow of the river basin with intense glacier retreating are mainly influenced by temperature changes and sensitive to warming climate change similarly the river basin with stable glaciers may not have a weak response to temperature warming the dominated factor for river discharge increasing or decreasing is needed to quantitatively analyze based on the relative range of temperature and precipitation

8196,study region the headwaters of tarim river study focus the tarim river basin is the largest arid inland river basin in china and recently only aksu yarkant and hotan rivers have natural hydraulic connections with it with climate changing the runoff from the headwaters of tarim river basin has undergone obvious changes that significantly affected downstream areas it is necessary to quantitatively attribute the impact of climate changes on runoff however the previous researches mostly focused on the aksu river basin and the attribution of runoff changes in the yarkant and hotan river basins was nearly blank this paper is dedicated to reveal the dominated climate factors for the runoff changes in all the three tributaries with large glacier coverage by combining the glacier enhanced swat model with the original and detrended precipitation and temperature inputs new hydrological insights for the region it was recognized that the rising temperature respectively contributed 94 and 66 to streamflow increases in the hotan and aksu river basins with slower glacier shrinking during 1965 2007 meanwhile the increased precipitation contributed 87 to streamflow increase in the yarkant river basin with a larger glacier area retreating ratio it is not as widely believed that the runoff changes in high glacierized basins are more correlated with temperature changes the respective variation amplitude of temperature and precipitation should be concerned in every catchment keywords climate change serial correlation streamflow changes variance correction approach tarim river basin 1 introduction high mountain asia is referred to as the asian water tower immerzeel et al 2020 which owns the greatest number of glaciers and largest ice volume outside of the polar regions farinotti et al 2019 nie et al 2021 yao et al 2012 the glacier meltwater modulates the discharge of many rivers originating from these regions which supports ecosystems and sustains for water use in the downstream nie et al 2021 pritchard 2019 with climate warming the glaciers are generally retreating and the runoff in the headwaters have undergone obvious changes that significantly affected the downstream areas especially for the arid region nie et al 2021 sorg et al 2012 unger shayesteh et al 2013 the tarim river basin therein is the largest arid inland river basin in china which feeds about 10 million people zhang et al 2009 and its source of water is mainly glacial snow meltwater accounting for 48 2 of the total water volume chen et al 2007 due to the one belt one road initiative achieving sustainable development in the tarim river basin where provides a passageway from asia to europe is becoming increasingly important chen et al 2016b nevertheless it became a representative of ecological fragility and environmental crisis caused by climate change and human activities in the past few years huang et al 2015 xue et al 2017 the tarim river basin is undergoing severe ecological degradation including drying of river channels li et al 2017 an increasing number of tributaries are losing their hydraulic connection with the mainstream of tarim river and disappearing in the taklimakan desert xu et al 2011c yang et al 2017 now only three major rivers the aksu yarkant and hotan rivers are still retain their natural hydraulic relationship with the mainstream gao et al 2010 xu et al 2011a and the proportions of annual discharge from the three rivers respectively accounted for 42 34 and 24 to the runoff of tarim river headwaters based on the observed outlet streamflow during 1961 2007 this indicates that the three river basins are all the dominated contributors for runoff of tarim river basin the aksu yarkant and hotan rivers respectively originate from the tienshan karakoram and kunlun mountains where is covered by large area of glaciers and with dominated snowmelt and glacier melt contributing chen et al 2019 based on the first and second china glacier inventory guo et al 2014 wu and li 2004 it can be realized that the glacier area coverage was similar in the three river basins however the glacier retreat ratios were different the glaciers in the tienshan mountains are more sensitive to climate change sorg et al 2012 while the glacier extent has been relative stable since the 1960s in the kunlun mountains and mass gains centered on west kunlun mountains lin et al 2017 shen et al 2020 that is often called the karakoram anomaly farinotti et al 2020 glacial change directly affects meltwater runoff and consequently the composition and seasonal variability of river flows descending from the mountains nie et al 2021 during the past fifty years the streamflow of headstreams in the tarim river basins has been increasing liu et al 2010 shen et al 2020 xu et al 2011a yang et al 2018 however the runoff of the three main tributaries presented different variations the annual runoff of aksu and yarkant rivers showed a significantly increasing trend while that of hotan river demonstrated a slight increase from 1961 to 2008 zhang and zuo 2017 however the scientific question of whether and to what extent the observed runoff increase can be attributed to rising temperature and or increased precipitation in the tarim river and its tributaries is still ambiguous the study related to the influence of climate change on the observed streamflow changes and the rigorous trend attribution mainly concentrated in the aksu river basin and the conclusions were not in unison due to the different using methods and models duethmann et al 2015 li et al 2016 2020 wang et al 2015 zhao et al 2015 for example wang et al 2015 and duethmann et al 2015 used distributed glacio hydrological models to simulate glacio hydrological processes in the kumirc catchment in tienshan mountain for the 1950s to 2010s although both concluded temperature change as the dominant contributor for streamflow change the quantitative contributions 57 and 90 were differences the attributed analysis referring to runoff changes of headwaters in yarkant and hotan river basins and even the whole tarim river basin was always qualitative based on the hydrometeorological data from observed stations chen et al 2009 li et al 2018 liu et al 2010 xu et al 2011a b especially for the west kunlun mountains with glacier anomaly the quantitative attribution of discharge changes was almost blank perhaps it is generally assumed that these streamflow changes in the high glacierized basins are likely dominated by temperature changes chen et al 2016a kundzewicz et al 2014 nie et al 2021 shen et al 2020 yet understanding the runoff response of glacierized catchments to climatic changes is particularly complex in the karakoram anomaly region given its varied discharge changes nie et al 2021 the anomalous glacier behavior in the karakoram and kunlun mountains is not only a curiosity in an epoch dominated by glacier retreat the glaciers importance for regional water supplies makes some of the unanswered scientific questions of great societal relevance farinotti et al 2020 therefore it is important to quantitatively and thoroughly explore the driver for river flow changes of the tributaries with different glacier changes in the tarim river basin the research has important implications for water resources development in this arid region and also for some similar river basins in which glacial melt forms an important part of the hydrological cycle therefore this study aims at assessing to what extent these streamflow trends of the three main tributaries of the tarim river basin can be attributed to changes in temperature or precipitation due to the complicated hydrological processes and scarce hydrometeorological observations in the high mountain areas fang et al 2018 liniger et al 1998 the attribution of streamflow changes in these regions are very difficult to be directly determined using statistical techniques instead distributed hydrological models are often the most preferred tool used to investigate and attribute long term variations in runoff unger shayesteh et al 2013 in this study the attribution analysis will be executed combining a simulation based approach using a hydrological model with an observation based statistical approach for constructing detrended climate scenarios which was successfully used to quantitatively separate the effects of temperature and precipitation changes on runoff bouraoui et al 2004 duethmann et al 2015 wang et al 2016a 2015 on the one hand for these glacierized mountain regions the distributed hydrological models are now widely updated with glacier modules for simulating glacier and snow hydrological processes in watersheds duethmann et al 2015 fang et al 2018 li et al 2020 luo et al 2013 lutz et al 2014 we will use a glacier enhanced swat soil water assessment tool model luo et al 2013 to investigate the impact of climate change on glacio hydrological processes this improved model can simulate the glacier dynamics by the glacier volume area scaling relationship and could reduce uncertainty in simulating glacial meltwater runoff luo et al 2013 it has been widely used in the tienshan pamir karakoram mountains for simulating the glacio hydrological processes gan et al 2015 luo et al 2018 wang et al 2016a 2015 zhang et al 2016 on the other hand before constructing the detrended climate scenarios the trends of observed precipitation and temperature data should be determined firstly the mann kendall mk trend test a non parametric statistical test is widely used in trend analysis studies aziz and burn 2006 onoz and bayazit 2012 yue et al 2002 yue and wang 2004 the null hypothesis in the mk technique requires the data series be independent and randomly ordered however time series of hydrometeorological variables show serial correlation i e a given value in time series is statistically dependent on previous values as shown for precipitation temperature and streamflow fan et al 2013 imbers et al 2014 khaliq et al 2009b sonali and kumar 2013 zhang et al 2014 application of mk technique to auto correlated data series can lead to an incorrect rejection of the null hypothesis of no trend whereas the null hypothesis is true li et al 2014 as a consequence serial correlations in hydrometeorological data series should not be neglected in long term trend analysis for the methods of trend analysis that can be used to remove serial correlation the variance correction vc approach is recommended as the proper trend detection technique khaliq et al 2009a stojkovic et al 2014 hence we will choose the vc approach for trend analysis before detrending the temperature and precipitation changes in this study the objective of this study is to systematically and thoroughly determine and quantize the dominated climate factors precipitation or temperature changes for streamflow changes in the main tributaries aksu yarkant and hotan rivers of the tarim river basin in the northwest china furthermore the dominant contributor to the changes in streamflow will be compared in the three different river basins with similar glacier area ratios but different retreating rates finally the zonal differentiation for the attribution of runoff changes in the glacierized basins will be identified based on the same set of methods and data 2 study area the tarim river basin is one of the world s largest endorheic drainage systems which is dominated by an arid inland climate with little precipitation and strong potential evapotranspiration chen et al 2016a yang et al 2015 as the largest inland river in china the tarim river spans 1321 km in length with a drainage area of about 1 million km2 the aksu yarkant and hotan rivers are the main tributaries draining into the main stem of tarim river recently the aksu river is the largest tributary in terms of runoff on the southern slope of tienshan mountain the kumaric and toxkan rivers are the two main branches in the upper reaches of the river the kumaric river originates from the northwest slope of the khantengri peak in the middle of the western tienshan mountains its upstream is mainly in kyrgyzstan the collecting area above the xiehela hydrological station is about 1 2 104 km2 and the trunk stream is 293 km long the glacier area is 3195 km2 based on the tienshan glacier dataset aizen et al 2007 and second china glacier inventory guo et al 2014 the catchment area of the toxkan river is about 1 8 104 km2 above the shaliguilk hydrological station and the mainstream is 457 km long these two rivers together form the aksu river with a source area of 32 461 km2 glacier area of about 3689 km2 and a total runoff of about 76 108 m3 the yarkant river is a representative river on the northern slope of the karakoram mountains kaqun station is the outlet of the river basin with a drainage area of 46 746 km2 the total number of glaciers glacier area and glacier area ratio is 2682 5528 km2 and 11 8 in this basin based on the second china glacier inventory respectively the streamflow is mostly contributed by glacier and snowmelt which mainly occurs during june to august wei et al 2019 the hotan river is formed by the confluent of the karakash river which originates from the northern slope of the karakoram mountains and the yurungkash river which originates from the northern slope of the kunlun mountains fig 1 wuluwati hydrological station is the flow control station at the outlet of karakash river it has a total length of 808 km and a basin area of 21 532 km2 there are large glacier groups in the source area with 2010 glaciers covering an area of 2169 5 km2 based on the second china glacier inventory the annual runoff of karakash river accounts for 51 of the annual runoff of the hotan river based on the observed outlet streamflow the controlled hydrographic station of the yurungkash river is tongguziluoke hydrographic station with a drainage area of 14 813 km2 there are 1334 glaciers in the basin covering a total area of 2954 km2 with a glacier coverage of 20 based on the second china glacier inventory the annual runoff of yurungkash river accounts for 49 of the annual runoff of hotan river the ratio of glacier area to basin area in the hotan river basin is 14 table 1 3 materials and methods 3 1 data description the dem land use soil data and glacier inventory in table 2 were used to delineate the study area into the hydrologic response units hrus sub basins and to generate tributaries and channel systems due to the scarce observed meteorological stations fig 1 the gridded aphrodite and pgmfd data were used as precipitation and temperature inputs table 2 the temperature and precipitation at high elevations were acquired by temperature and precipitation lapse rates tlaps and plaps based on wang et al 2016b the discharge data of hydrological stations and observed glacier area changes were used to calibrate and validate the models detailed descriptions of these data processing can be found in the previous studies wang et al 2016a b 3 2 trend detection methods in this study in order to remove the serial correlation in long term precipitation and temperature data series we used the vc approach this approach is the corrected mk test for the trend analysis of precipitation temperature and streamflow time series 3 2 1 mann kendall mk test the mk test gilbert 1987 hirsch et al 1982 1991 is a non parametric analysis that is widely used in hydrometeorological studies the test makes no assumptions regarding data distribution and can be used for incomplete seasonal data with serial dependence and linear or non linear trends the mk statistics s is computed as follows 1 s k 1 n 1 j k 1 n s g n x j x k s g n x j x k 1 x j x k 0 0 x j x k 0 1 x j x k 0 where x 1 x n are the hydrometeorological variables ordered chronologically and n is the number of points for analysis for large datasets n 40 the z test statistics is given as 2 z s 1 v a r s s 0 0 s 0 s 1 v a r s s 0 3 v a r s 1 18 n n 1 2 n 5 where var s is the variance of the data series the mk test rejects the null hypothesis if z zcr z zcr positive and negative z values indicate increasing and decreasing trends respectively 3 2 2 variance correction vc approach the vc approach was used to modify the mk test by removing serial correlation on the basis that n serially correlated data contain the same information as n n uncorrelated data using extensive monte carlo simulations yue et al 2002 demonstrated that the serial correlation in a time series does not alter the asymptotic normality and mean of the mk test statistic s however it changes the variance of s the existence of positive or negative serial correlation could accordingly increase or decrease the variance of s hamed and rao 1998 and yue and wang 2004 proposed the need for correcting the variance of s using an adequate sample size that reflects the effect of serial correlation on the variance of s the modified variance of s is given as 4 v a r s c f v a r s where var s is the variance of the mk test statistic s for the original sample data and cf is a correction factor as proposed by hamed and rao 1998 and yue and wang 2004 in this study the latter cf was used and is given as 5 c f 1 2 k 1 n 1 1 k n r k 6 r k 1 n k i 1 n k x i x x i k x 1 n i 1 n x i x 2 where rk is the lag k serial correlation coefficient of the data and x is the mean of the time series to judge if the data series are serially correlated the significance of rk at the significance level of Œ± 0 10 was assessed in the two tailed test based on the approximation 7 1 1 645 n k 1 n k r k 1 1 645 n k 1 n k if the lag k serial correlation is computed in eq 6 falls within the confidence interval given in eq 7 then the data are assumed to be serially independent otherwise the data are regarded as significantly serially correlated only time series consisting of a linear trend and a lag 1 autoregressive ar 1 process are explored which are commonly used in hydrology yue and pilon 2003 the approach works under the assumption of an ar 1 process when only r1 is considered 3 2 3 trend slope the sen s non parametric method gilbert 1987 sen 1968 was used to calculate the slope of data series using the following equation 8 Œ≤ median x j x k j k k j where Œ≤ is sen s slope x j x k are the hydrometeorological variables 3 3 glacier enhanced swat model swat is a physically based long term basin scale distributed hydrological model swat is widely used in the hydrological cycle and water resource management simulations arnold et al 2012 gassman et al 2007 luo et al 2013 developed a glacier module and integrated it into the swat model to realize simulating watershed glacio hydrological processes the detailed descriptions of the model are documented by luo et al 2013 the module treats each individual glacier as a hydrological response unit ghru each ghru is divided into ten elevation bands the glacier mass balance is simulated in each band the simulated glacier mass balance components include mass accumulation sublimation melting of ice and snow and refreezing of these melt waters the glacier mass balance is given as 9 d w g d t 1 f m s f where wg is the depth of water equivalent of ice in mm h2o m is the melt rate of ice in mm h2o day 1 f is the ratio of meltwater refreezing s is the sublimation rate of ice in mm h2o day 1 f is glacier accumulation rate in mm h2o day 1 and t is the time step in days the ice and snow melt is simulated using the degree day factor approach hock 2005 hock et al 2005 the glacier volume is calculated based on the total glacier mass balance and the glacier area is updated through the glacier volume area scaling relation chen and ohmura 1990 this relation is as follows 10 a g l a v g l a m 1 n where agla km2 and vgla m km2 are surface area and volume of the glacier respectively based on liu et al 2003 m is set at 40 and n at 1 35 in this study these values were derived from measured glacier data in northwest china the relationship between glacier volume and glacier area and depth of water equivalent of glacier mass is expressed as 11 v gla w g a g l a œÅ i where wg is the equivalent water depth of ice and œÅi is the bulk density of ice usually taken as 0 9 kg m 3 in this model the runoff in each hru ghru is split into four possible contributing factors rainfall runoff snow melt glacier melt and baseflow precipitation based runoff consists of surface runoff and lateral flow released from soil water storage generated from rainfall snow melt consists of snow meltwater released from snow storage the runoff from glacier melt encompasses all the melt generated in the glacierized area including the supraglacial snow melt ice melt and rainfall runoff on the ice surface baseflow is released from shallow and deep groundwater storage so precipitation and icemelt are the water inputs the total runoff in all hrus is summed to determine the runoff in the entire watershed the river discharge is routed to determine the loss via river channels the glacier enhanced swat model has been applied to several alpine watersheds in tienshan pamir karakoram mountains gan et al 2015 luo et al 2013 2018 ma et al 2015 wang et al 2016a b wang et al 2015 and it has been proven as a useful tool for simulating glacio hydrological processes the model calibration and validation were carried out from two aspects river discharge at hydrological stations and glacier area changes by trial and error method some sensitive parameters were acquired from previous studies conducted in the similar study area acceptable calibration and validation results are obtained after repeated trials the specifics of the procedure for parameter calibration are documented in wang et al 2016a the so called multi variable calibration and validation sorg et al 2014 the monthly streamflow data series for each gauge station was used for the calibration and validation optimization targets the glacier area and mass balance changes were also used to constrain the calibration process the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and percent bias pbias were used to evaluate the model performance during parameterization the modeling performance was rated using the method adopted by moriasi et al 2007 where 0 75 nse 1 0 suggests very good 0 65 nse 0 75 good 0 50 nse 0 65 satisfactory and nse 0 50 unsatisfactory simulation results also pbias 10 suggests very good 10 pbias 15 good 15 pbias 25 satisfactory and pbias 25 unsatisfactory simulation results 3 4 attribution based on original and detrended scenarios the attribution method used in this study was ever proposed by wang et al 2015 to investigate how changes in temperature and precipitation affect glacio hydrological processes combining the distributed glacier enhanced swat model with detrended climatic factors input the detrended approach has been elaborated in wang et al 2015 and wang et al 2016a in this study the improved detrended approach for climatic variables with significant trends was based on the vc trend analysis test at 0 05 significance level and then detrended temperature and precipitation data series were generated based on original temperature and precipitation t and p and detrended values t0 and p0 four climatic forcing scenarios table 3 were designated to reveal the climate change impacts on glacio hydrological processes in a given historical period typically t0 and p0 series scenario 4 were treated as the climatic background we compared and quantified the differences between the simulated changes in streamflow and attribute the impact of climate change on streamflow the overall trend due to both precipitation and temperature changes can be estimated from 1 the trend of the simulation with the original climate input time series scenario 1 minus 2 the simulation with the detrended climate input time series scenario 4 individually the overall trend due to precipitation changes can be estimated from 1 the trend of the simulation with the detrended temperature and the original precipitation input scenario 2 minus 2 the simulation with the detrended climate input time series scenario 4 the overall trend due to temperature changes can thus be estimated from 1 the trend of the simulation with the original temperature and the detrended precipitation input scenario 3 minus 2 the simulation with the detrended climate input time series scenario 4 4 results and discussion 4 1 model calibration and validation 4 1 1 streamflow based on the quality of observed streamflow we chose the corresponding periods as calibration and validation periods for different hydrological stations as shown in fig 2 the nse and pbias evaluation indices for the calibration and validation processes in the aksu yarkant and hotan river basins are listed in table 4 based on the rating criteria provided by moriasi et al 2007 for the calibration and validation stages nse 0 68 suggested that the model performed very good or good for hydrological stations in the hotan yarkant and kumaric river basins nse values were 0 7 and 0 62 in the shaliguilk hydrological station suggesting that the model performance in the toxkan river basin was good or satisfactory respectively pbias values also suggested very good or good model performances for most of the stations and satisfactory for tongguziluoke and shaliguilk hydrological stations only during the calibrated period hydrographs of simulated monthly streamflow at these hydrological stations fit well with the observed values and indicated that the simulated streamflow was reasonable fig 2 4 1 2 glacier area changes it can be seen from table 5 that the simulated glacier area changes in the tributaries of aksu yarkant and hotan river basins were close to the observed values for the hotan and yarkant river basins changes in the glacier area were calculated based on the first and second china glacier inventory in 1960s and 2000s and that of the aksu river basin was from both china glacier inventories and tienshan glacier dataset v 1 in 1970s and 2000s the calculation of glacier area changes were based on the area of each individual glacier existing in both the glacier inventories of two periods on the scale of basin the area of these glaciers in each glacier inventory was respectively added together and then the retreat rate was calculated by comparison on different glacier sizes the process for calculating glacier shrinking ratio is similar to that in catchment scaling the glacial retreat in the hotan river basin 1 4 was the slowest compared to that in yarkant and aksu river basins 8 7 and 4 5 moreover the area changes in glaciers with different sizes in the three river basins were assessed and presented in fig 3 in every size class the rates of simulated glacier area shrinkage were very similar to the observed values furthermore in the hotan river basin some glaciers in the size classes 5 50 km2 showed advanced rates that is explained as the karakoram anomaly farinotti et al 2020 our model could also simulate the advance of glaciers well 4 2 characteristic of streamflow and runoff components changes the simulated annual streamflow was compared with the observed values during 1965 2007 in the aksu yarkant and hotan river basins as shown in fig 4 the simulated streamflow in the three river basins all showed increasing trends and were fit to the observed streamflow based on the vc approach at a significance of 0 05 the annual streamflow increased non significantly by 1 6 108 and 1 7 108 m3 10 yr in the hotan and yarkant river basins and significantly by 3 3 108 m3 10 yr in the aksu river basin respectively as shown in table 6 seasonally spring or autumn streamflow in the hotan and yarkant river basins showed significant increasing trends while summer streamflow in the aksu river basin increased significantly the other seasons showed non significant increasing trends in the three river basins overall only the streamflow in the aksu river basin had a significant increasing trend from 1965 to 2007 and especially embodied in the wet season the runoff is composed of rainfall runoff snowmelt glacier melt and baseflow meanwhile the contributions of these components to total runoff were very different in the yarkant and aksu river basins the glacier melt had the dominant contribution about 48 and 43 56 for kumaric river and 21 for toxkan river respectively fig 5 these values are similar with that simulated by duethmann et al 2015 35 48 for kumaric river and 9 24 for toxkan river zhao et al 2015 53 6 for kumaric river yin et al 2017 51 6 for the yarkant river and fang et al 2018 based on different hydrological models in terms of the glacier melt components the contribution of the ice melt was 58 and it was much bigger than that of the supraglacial snowmelt in the yarkant river basin the contributions of ice melt and supraglacial snowmelt to the glacier melt were both nearly 40 in the other two river basins fig 6 in the hotan river basin the snowmelt was the dominant contributor to the runoff 37 and the glacier melt contributed only 25 to runoff fig 5 the contributions of runoff and glacier melt components varied widely in different river basins and the changes in every component were also very different the glacier melt and ice melt in the hotan and aksu river basins showed significant or non significant increasing trends respectively the yarkant river basin had non significant decreasing trends for both glacier and ice melt these complex and different variation for streamflow and runoff components in different river basins were determined by different climate factors and catchment characteristics in the following section the attribution of streamflow changes in the high glacierized aksu yarkant and hotan river basins during the past fifty years will be elaborated 4 3 attribution of streamflow changes 4 3 1 precipitation and temperature changes based on the detrended method the detrended precipitation and temperature series were generated using the detrended method based on the comparison of detrended and original values the changes in multi year average annual and monthly precipitation and temperature were quantified during the period 1965 2007 fig 7 for annual average precipitation obvious changes were detected mainly in the yarkant and aksu river basins where the annual average precipitation increased by 0 8 and 1 6 respectively on the monthly scale precipitation increased mainly in june and july in the yarkant river basin while in march and october in the aksu river basin however in the hotan river basin the precipitation only increased by 0 2 for annual average values and the increases occurred in april and may comparison of detrended annual average temperature with original values showed an increasing trend in all the three river basins the increases were more remarkable in the hotan and aksu river basins the annual average temperature was 0 43 and 0 36 c higher than the detrended temperature from 1965 to 2007 in these two basins the cumulative increase in the average annual temperature in the yarkant river basin was only 0 16 c on the monthly scale the warming mainly occurred in winter november to february in all the three river basins from june to september the original temperature was nearly 0 1 0 6 c higher than the detrended temperature in the hotan and aksu river basins at the same time there were no remarkable differences between the original and detrended temperature during these months in the yarkant river basin in any case the precipitation increased obviously in the yarkant and aksu river basins while the temperature rose significantly in the hotan and aksu river basins during 1965 2007 table 6 4 3 2 attribution of the effect of precipitation and temperature on streamflow changes based on the detrended method the streamflow changes calculated by comparing the detrended scenarios p0 t0 with original scenarios p t are shown in table 7 and fig 8 the annual streamflow from 1965 to 2007 increased by 4 6 1 2 and 4 2 in the aksu yarkant and hotan river basins respectively moreover these increases mainly occurred from june to september summer season when considering the contribution of the changes in precipitation to streamflow scenario 2 t0 p and scenario 4 t0 p0 were compared the increasing precipitation caused an increase in the streamflow by 1 6 1 and 0 2 in the aksu yarkant and hotan river basins respectively moreover due to the effect of precipitation changes the streamflow increased more obviously in july and august in the yarkant river basin while in may and june in the hotan and aksu river basins scenario 3 t p0 was compared with scenario 4 t0 p0 in order to quantify the effect of temperature rising on streamflow changes from 1965 to 2007 in the hotan and aksu river basins the effect of warmer temperature on the streamflow change was much more extensive the original annual streamflow was 4 and 3 higher than the detrended value in these two river basins and the increases mainly appeared in june july and september in the yarkant river basin the annual average streamflow was only 0 15 higher than the detrended value overall the rising temperature contributed by 94 and 66 to streamflow increase in the hotan and aksu river basins respectively meanwhile the increase of precipitation contributed 87 to streamflow increase in the yarkant river basin therefore temperature rising was the primary cause for streamflow increases in the hotan and aksu river basins with slower glacier shrinking which was in line with the previous findings related to the aksu river basin based on statistical approach or hydrological models duethmann et al 2015 kundzewicz et al 2014 shen et al 2018 nevertheless in the yarkant river basin with a larger glacier area retreat ratio precipitation changes were the dominant factor for increased streamflow there is some consistency with the previous view that the increasing rate of streamflow was nearly equal to the rate of increase in precipitation during the summer months over the karakoram mountains in recent years mukhopadhyay and khan 2014 4 3 3 contribution of glacier runoff changes on streamflow changes the differences in runoff components changes were the root cause of the variations in streamflow changes in different river basins comparing the detrended scenarios p0 t0 with original scenarios p t the changes in runoff components of every river basin are shown in figs 9 and 10 the total runoff changes were made up by the sum of changes in rainfall runoff snowmelt glacier melt and baseflow the contribution of changes in each runoff component to total runoff changes can be calculated as follows 12 f rr Œ¥ q rr Œ¥ q rr Œ¥ q sm Œ¥ q gm Œ¥ q bf 100 13 f sm Œ¥ q sm Œ¥ q rr Œ¥ q sm Œ¥ q gm Œ¥ q bf 100 14 f gm Œ¥ q gm Œ¥ q rr Œ¥ q sm Œ¥ q gm Œ¥ q bf 100 15 f bf Œ¥ q bf Œ¥ q rr Œ¥ q sm Œ¥ q gm Œ¥ q bf 100 where Œ¥ q rr Œ¥ q sm Œ¥ q gm and Œ¥ q bf represents the absolute value of changes in the mean rainfall runoff snowmelt glacier melt and baseflow over the years respectively frr fsm fgm and fbf represent the relative contributions of rainfall runoff snowmelt glacier melt and baseflow changes to the change of total runoff respectively these contributions of runoff components in the aksu yarkant and hotan river basins are shown in fig 9 in the aksu river basin enhanced glacier melt contributed 56 to increasing streamflow and was the dominant contributor fig 9 for one of the tributaries of the aksu river the kumaric river basin the contribution from increases in glacier melt to total runoff changes was 54 6 which is similar with 50 6 simulated by li et al 2020 and less than 56 85 by duethmann et al 2015 this may be due to the prescribed constant linear decrease rate when updating annual glacier area in duethmann et al 2015 which would lead to inaccuracy in estimating glacier mass balance glacier melt and its contribution to runoff as well li et al 2020 moreover the increase in glacier melt and ice melt was mainly caused by rising temperature figs 9 and 10 among other small contributors to the streamflow changes the increases in snowmelt and baseflow were mainly affected by increasing precipitation whereas the increased rainfall runoff was due to the rising temperature as a consequence in the aksu river basin with a small glacier retreat the increased streamflow was mainly contributed by glacier melt changes at the same time the warming temperature was the dominant factor for glacier changes and enhanced river discharge in the yarkant river basin the glacier melt changes were not the primary contributor for streamflow changes 27 although the glacier melt was the dominant contribution for total runoff 48 nevertheless the rainfall runoff changes contributed the most it can be seen from fig 9 that the increases in rainfall runoff were mainly due to increased precipitation so even in a river basin with a larger glacier retreating ratio the streamflow increases were mainly caused by the precipitation changes rather than the warming temperature which affected the changes in glacier melt and icemelt figs 9 and 10 in the hotan river basin the glacier melt only contributed 25 of the total runoff but changes in glacier melt were the primary contributor 49 for runoff changes during 1965 2007 comparing the detrended scenario 4 p0 t0 with original scenario 1 p t scenarios 2 p0 t scenarios 3 p t0 the glacier melt increased almost solely because of rising temperature fundamentally the glacier melt change was contributed by the increase in icemelt which was also merely due to temperature increases additionally the changes in rainfall runoff and baseflow are also mainly affected by rising temperatures which influenced precipitation patterns therefore even in the glacier stabilized hotan river basin the warming temperature was still the dominant factor for streamflow increasing the non significant precipitation increases had a minor impact on streamflow changes perhaps if the precipitation changed significantly the streamflow changes in the river basin with a stable glacier would mainly be affected by precipitation changes by comparing the results in the yarkant river basin with that in the hotan and aksu river basins we concluded that the changes in streamflow of river basins with intense glacier retreating are not necessarily mainly influenced by temperature changes and sensitive to the warming climate at the same time the river basins with stable glaciers may be more sensitive to rising temperature than precipitation changes the dominant factor for river discharge changes needs to be analyzed quantitatively based on the relative range and seasonality of temperature and precipitation changes the dominant increase in precipitation during the spring season and the warming temperature during winter would lead to the glaciers remained stable however the increased glacier meltwater due to rising temperature may be still the main contributor to the enhanced river flow when precipitation in summer is constant geographically it is widely considered that a dramatic uptrend in streamflow of highly glaciated basins are more correlated with temperature change and likely dominated by the rising temperature chen et al 2016a nie et al 2021 shen et al 2020 however our study indicates that it should not be taken for granted that glaciers and runoff in glacier stable basins are not sensitive to temperature rise and basins with significant glacial retreat are more affected by climate warming 4 4 uncertainties for the attribution methods in this study the attribution analysis of the impact of precipitation and temperature changes on streamflow changes in the glacierized river basins of the tarim river basin was executed by combining the constructing detrended climate scenarios with a glacial hydrological model these approaches would bring some uncertainties for the simulated results related to the attribution of glacier melt and runoff changes here we will mainly discuss the statistical trend test method and simulation method for glacier change we using 4 4 1 effect of serial correlation in precipitation and temperature data in this study we used the vc approach removing the serial correlation in variables to detect the trends in hydrometeorological data and realized that considering the serial correlation was necessary for trend analysis in this section we discuss the serial correlation in precipitation and temperature data and the effect of serial correlation on trend analysis to judge if the aphrodite precipitation and pgmfd temperature data were serially correlated the significance of the lag 1 serial correlation at Œ± 0 10 of the two tailed tests was determined using eqs 6 and 7 the serial correlation coefficients for aphrodite precipitation and pgmfd temperature grids are given in fig 11 overall the serial correlation in temperature especially for minimum temperature was much more significant than that in precipitation in the aksu yarkant and hotan river basins the results agree with the previous research findings yue and hashino 2003 there were significant serial correlations r 1 0 23 in annual precipitation for about 50 grids in the aksu river basin and nearly 20 grids in the other two river basins for maximum temperature only a few girds in the hotan and yarkant river basins and 50 grids in the aksu river basin had significant serial correlation however for minimum temperature the lag 1 serial correlation of nearly all grids in every river basin was significant therefore serial correlation in temperature especially for minimum temperature should be considered in order to quantify the effect of serial correlation on trend analysis the trends in aphrodite precipitation and pgmfd temperature grids individually tested by mk and vc methods are compared in fig 12 it can be seen that the number of grids with significant increasing or decreasing trends detected by vc approach was fewer than that by mk test p 0 05 due to the effect of serial correlation whether it was for precipitation or temperature in detail for aphrodite precipitation grids based on vc approach nearly all grids in the aksu river basin showed a non significant increasing or decreasing trend if tested by mk method the percentages of grids with significant trends were improved by 20 moreover some grids showed opposite trends based on the two different tests similarly the vc approach gave a significant increasing trend for most grids in the yarkant river basin but the number of significant grids was still fewer than that based on the mk test less than 10 of grids exhibited a significant increasing trend in the hotan river basin based on the vc test which was remarkably less than that based on the mk test 50 overall the presence of serial correlation made overestimating the significances of trends in precipitation and the effect of serial correlation in precipitation on the detection of the trend was quite apparent in the aksu and hotan river basins concerning pgmfd temperature grids it can be seen from fig 12 that the effect of serial correlation on the trend in temperature was much larger in the yarkant river basin than in the other two river basins based on mk test all pgmfd temperature grids in the three river basins showed a significant increasing trend for the maximum temperature the number of grids with significantly increasing trends under the mk test was 35 more than that under vc approach in the yarkant river basin however these differences of significance were fewer in the hotan and aksu river basins for the minimum temperature the detected results by mk and vc tests were very different especially for the hotan and yarkant river basins based on mk test almost all grids in all the three river basins showed a significant increase however only a few grids in the hotan and yarkant river basins increased significantly under vc approach also in the aksu river basin the number of grids with the significant increase tested by vc approach was nearly 50 less than that by mk test the differences in the significance of temperature trends detected under mk and vc tests were large from figs 11 and 12 it can be concluded that trend analysis by mk test could result in inconsistent conclusions whether considering the serial correlation or not positive serial correlation can lead to an overestimation of the trend and increase the variance of the mk statistic this is according to the point in yue et al 2002 moreover comparing with the simulated results of different detrended scenarios it can be found that even the opposing sign changes for streamflow were revealed in the yarkant river basin based on different trend analysis when detrending if mk and vc tests were respectively used to detect the trends in precipitation and temperature in the yarkant river basin and the detrended scenarios conducted were used to attribute the streamflow changes mk test suggested that the main contributor of the increases in streamflow of the yarkant river basin was the rise in temperature whereas vc approach attributed it to rise in precipitation fig 13 it is identified that temperature change was the main cause of the streamflow changes when the serial correlations of temperature and precipitation were ignored however when the serial correlations were removed in trend detection precipitation change became the main reason for streamflow changes it can be concluded that whether to consider the serial correlation may directly cause the opposite of the detecting results the effect of serial correlation on the attribution analysis was also show in the previous studies for the attribution analysis of streamflow changes in the kumaric river basin wang et al 2015 neglected serial correlations of precipitation temperature and streamflow data series while duethmann et al 2015 removed any such correlations using the trend free pre whitening tfpw technique although both concluded temperature change as the dominant contributor for streamflow change the quantitative results were different therefore the mk test for trend detection should be modified to prevent the detection of false trends when data have a significant serial correlation the approaches such as pre whitening pw tfpw vc and block bootstrap bbs are widely used in combination with the mk technique to remove the serial correlation beharry et al 2014 da silva et al 2015 hamed 2009 khaliq et al 2009a mohsin and gough 2010 salas et al 1980 sonali and kumar 2013 tabari et al 2015 while pw and tfpw approaches remove serial correlations in data series beforehand vc and block bootstrap modify the estimation of variation in the mk technique khaliq et al 2009a noted that while the modified mk test with pw and bbs has less power in the presence of serial correlation the tfpw approach is inappropriate in preserving the nominal level of significance moreover the power of tfpw mk is affected by the shape of the trend and the presence of non linear trends in autocorrelated series blain 2015 the vc approach is recommended as the proper trend detection technique used to remove serial correlation khaliq et al 2009a stojkovic et al 2014 so the vc approach used in our study could reduce some uncertainties from the serial correlation of precipitation and temperature data when doing the attribution analysis of runoff changes 4 4 2 method for simulating glacier area change the glacier simulation method in this study is based on the ghru to simulate the glacier mass balance and glacier morphology change the glacier mass balance was calculated by the degree day factor method and the glacier morphology was calculated by v a scaling relationship when simulating a single glacier based on sufficient observation data another method namely the energy balance method can be adopted for mass balance simulation which is also the method most consistent with the physical mechanism hock 2003 jansson et al 2003 however the degree day factor method is much more simplified and has good applicability in glacier simulation in the basin with scarce observed data kriegel et al 2013 wiltshire 2014 the degree of moraine cover and bare ice area have not been differentiated in this study which can be improved in the future for the simulation of glacier morphology the v a relationship is adopted to simulate glacier change which is based on empirical relation but has the basis of physical formula derivation bahr et al 2015 the v a scaling relationship is widely used in glacier hydrology studies hirabayashi et al 2010 this approach converts the calculated volume changes mass balance into changes in the glacier area however the glacier dynamics method can monitor the glacier morphology change comprehensively the glacier dynamics method can obtain the glacier thickness and the change of mass balance at a different elevation and reduce the uncertainty of the glacier dynamic simulation although the energy balance method combined with glacier dynamics is a leading edge method its extensive input requirements make its applicability in hydrological models at large watershed scales at the watershed scale the combination of degree day factor and v a scaling relationship brings great convenience to the hydrological simulation of glaciers several previous studies have also shown that it is a relatively reliable method lutz et al 2014 radiƒá et al 2008 zhao et al 2019 in the future remote sensing satellites and other methods may help to acquire more glacier observation data to combine glacier dynamic method with energy balance methods for simulating glacier mass balance and dynamic change it may lead to more accurately simulating the flow generation process in glacier basin attributing the influence of climate change on runoff change in snow and glacier melt dominated basins and revealing the primary factors for glacier stability 5 conclusions combining a glacio hydrological model with the original and detrended precipitation and temperature data inputs we quantitatively attributed the effect of precipitation and temperature changes on runoff increases of the three highly glacierized tributaries aksu yarkant and hotan rivers which are the only three headstreams recently having natural hydraulic connections with the tarim river our key findings are listed as follows 1 the significant serial correlation usually exists in the climatic series data especially for the temperature data therefore it is advisable to remove serial correlation in trend analysis in order to avoid the detection of false trends the vc approach considering removing serial correlation is more suitable for trend analysis in our study and could reduce some uncertainty from the attribution analysis 2 temperature rising was the primary cause for streamflow increases in the hotan and aksu river basins with slower glacier shrinking precipitation changes were the dominant factor for increasing streamflow in the yarkant river basin with a larger glacier area retreating ratio based on the original and detrended simulated results of the investigated catchments during 1965 2007 it was noted that the rising temperature contributed 94 and 66 to streamflow increases in the hotan and aksu river basins and changes in glacier melt were the primary contributor for streamflow changes 49 and 56 respectively in comparison the increase of precipitation contributed 87 to streamflow increase in the yarkant river basin and the rainfall runoff changes were the primary contributor for streamflow changes we can quantitatively recognize that it is not as widely believed that the changes in streamflow of the river basin with intense glacier retreating are mainly influenced by temperature changes and sensitive to warming climate change similarly the river basin with stable glaciers may not have a weak response to temperature warming the dominated factor for river discharge increasing or decreasing is needed to quantitatively analyze based on the relative range of temperature and precipitation

has increased in urban and rural regions due to increasing population and industrialization of agricultural irrigation he et al 2020a taweesin et al 2018 over the last few decades water crises have emerged in heavily populated regions currently maintenance and optimal usage of water supplies are among the most critical concerns chezgi et al 2016 das and pal 2020 lu et al 2019 drought has put more pressure on water resources and the need for successful management of groundwater has become crucial feng et al 2020 nguyen et al 2020a groundwater is one of the most affordable water supply choices for homes agriculture and other uses arabameri et al 2020e the day to day demand for groundwater is increasing in the aforementioned fields which is exhausting the known natural aquifers adeyeye et al 2019 therefore groundwater potential gwp mapping may be critical in the creation of water basin management plans gwp refers to the probability of the occurrence of groundwater or the amount of groundwater storage within a region khosravi et al 2018b the lack of data indicating the existence or absence of groundwater in parts of the basins together with the small number of speculative groundwater wells that can be identified lead to regional hydrological mismanagement fashae et al 2014 over the last decade given the development of photogrammetry gis and rs han et al

regions of the world adeyeye et al 2019 arabameri et al 2019 chen et al 2018 zhang et al 2019a in some studies basic common mathematical models have been used to assess gwp such as the analytical

logistic regression lr nguyen et al 2020a and artificial neural networks anns lee et al 2018 in semi quantitative models like the ahp expert opinions have been used to tune them but for similar geo environmental factors or for the same location the models require long term knowledge of the groundwater and causal factors which are not available in most cases akgun 2012 statistical techniques are commonly considered the most suitable method for gwp mapping at scales from 1 20 000 to 1 50 000 because springs and wells can be mapped in detail dai et al 2001 additionally various studies have illustrated applicable ensemble methods using the previously mentioned models such as ebf and boosted regression tree brt kordestani et al 2019 woe and lr chen et al 2018 ebf and tree based models naghibi et al 2019 and ann and real adaboost rab nguyen et al 2020b to create gwp maps gpms however statistical models do not consider nonlinear relationships and as a result artificial intelligence

decision stumps pham et al 2019 alternating decision trees adtree chen et al 2020a anns nguyen et al 2020b and support vector machines svms chen et al 2019b the goal of each is to find the most economical and efficient procedure note also that using field evidence in gis based models improves results adeyeye 2015 for greater accuracy in gwp mapping the use of hybrid learning models has been greatly enhanced chen et al 2020b proposed using decision algorithms based on j48 trees adaptive boosting or adaboost bagging random subspace rs dagging and rotation forest hereafter j48 ab bag rs dag and rof respectively to identify locations with gwp pham et al 2019 carried out a comparative study of the simple decision stumps classifier and three orthogonal forest multi boost and bagging methods more recently to achieve greater reliability various hybrid ensemble ml models have been suggested combining a base model with optimization algorithms or ensemble techniques for example al fugara et al 2020 combined svm and genetic algorithms to construct a hybrid model in the jerash and ajloun region of jordan miraki et al 2019 developed an ensemble model combining the rs and rf rs rf classifier methods to map the gwp of the qorveh dehgolan plain in iran nguyen et al nguyen et al 2020b proposed an ensemble model combining an ann with real adaptive boosting ann rab for assessment of the gpm in daknong province in vietnam these three ensemble experiments have shown that hybrid ensemble models have better predictive performance than single classifier models therefore ml ensemble models and their hybrids demonstrate good capability for the development of reliable gpms in this study the main objective was to assess gwp by applying three novel ensemble models combining the accurate rs ml method with multilayer perceptron mlp na√Øve bayes tree nbtree and the cart ensemble technique hereafter mlp rs nbtree rs and cart rs respectively in addition the three single models are assessed mlp nbtree and cart the gpms of the single models are benchmarks against which the results of the hybrid models are evaluated the mlp nbtree and cart algorithms have been applied separately in landslide flood and gully erosion susceptibility mapping as well as in groundwater and spring potentiality mapping in the literature we found that each of the benchmark models predicted the best result when compared with other models chen et al 2017a applied the dempster shafer lr and mlp algorithms in an ann model for landslide susceptibility mapping lsm the ann had the best accuracy 69 62 zare et al 2013 applied mlp and the radial basic function in an ann for lsm the mlp algorithm had the best accuracy 88 1 arabameri et al 2020b applied three models adtree nbtree and logistic model tree to gully erosion susceptibility mapping nbtree was the second best predictive model area under curve auc 93 9 youssef et al 2016a applied four modeling techniques rf brt cart and a general linear model the cart model had the highest accuracy 86 2 usually the construction of hybrid ensemble models is interesting research that has gained growing interest for understanding and solving a wide range of geo hydrological and geotechnical problems including groundwater prediction and evaluation pham et al 2020 although many hybrid ensemble models were designed but the ensemble of random subspace rs learner based modeling of landslide susceptibility using different artificial intelligence based tree classifiers was not attempted earlier significantly these models were applied in one of the spring potential areas of northwest iran namely the tabriz river basin to select the best model for the accurate groundwater potentiality mapping thus we use mlp nbtree and cart as benchmark models in determining the accuracy of the new ensemble models in addition the introduction of train surface texture tst is innovative in this study this new factor is tested for its effect on prediction accuracy assessment of the relative importance of each factor has been determined for lr rf and rab and the accuracy of each model was evaluated using the area under the curve of receiver operating

surface where water emerges from underneath the ground springs may form when unconfined aquifers break through the surface manga 2001 springs develop where streams are eroded so deeply through the valley walls that the aquifer is visible and spring lines appear spring is the transformation of groundwater into surface water hu et al 2007 springs are strong sources of gwp examining the distribution of the positions of both historical and contemporary springs it may be possible to forecast the future groundwater capacity of the region therefore a spring inventory map was compiled from data archived by the iwrmc and the locations of the springs were cross examined using handheld gps during a field survey fig 4 in total 205 springs were identified in the study area of which 144 70 were randomly selected for model training and the remaining 61 30 for validation fig 5 non spring points were extracted where there were no springs to the surface non spring locations have also been created in arcgis v10 4 for modeling gwp and also split into training and validation datasets 2 2 2 groundwater conditioning factors based on the research area and field observations geophysical

et al 2019b recently the phenomenon of climate change has been adversely affected on hydrological cycle of basins and alters the magnitude and pattern of stream flow and affected environmental sustainability and water resources tian et al 2020 wang et al 2021 zhang et al 2019a the hydrological factors rainfall dts and dd are important for indicating the potential for water and groundwater lee et al 2020 rainfall is one of the most significant variables in the potential model for groundwater and the larger the precipitation area the greater the potential for groundwater oikonomidis et al 2015 rainfall is a hydrological method to regenerate aquifers magesh et al 2012 the groundwater level fluctuates with almost the same period as rainfall nguyen et al 2020b in this analysis the average annual rainfall data were collected from the iran meteorological organization the rainfall map was prepared with meteorological data from the 20 year period 2000 2019 using kriging interpolation in arcgis v10 4 rainfall has a substantial effect on groundwater capacity and its production because it has a significant effect on the volume of water entering the groundwater system yu and lin 2015 very high elevations have less potential for springs than medium to low elevations due to more runoff occurring at the latter contributing to recharge avand et al 2020 aspect indicates slope direction which affects the amount and intensity of rainfall i e windward slopes are more favorable for rainfall than leeward slopes solomon and quiel 2006 this has an indirect effect on the amount of water infiltrating the earth and thus affecting groundwater concave surfaces hold more water particularly during times of heavy rainfall pham et al 2019 dts and dd were determined from a map of the river network in arcgis lulc is another significant factor impacting groundwater recharging capability anthropogenic activities and climate change are the primary causes of changes in stream flow the lulc map was taken from 2018 landsat 8 data at a spatial resolution of 12 5 m see supplementary table 2 all gwcfs were mapped as shown in fig 6 a n the hydraulic conductivity of an area is also affected by soil structure of that area xu et al 2021 tst factor calculated with saga gis software the hand normalizes topography based on the local relative heights from the drainage lines presenting the topology of relative soil gravitational potentials or local draining potentials rahmati et al 2018 nobre et al 2011 showed that hand has a high association with the depth of the water table giving a reliable spatial depiction of soil water conditions the statistical equations for tri and hand are as follows 1 t r i f s m e a n f s m i n i m u m f s m a x i m u m f s m i n i m u m where f s m e a n is the focal statistics for mean elevation f s m i n i m u m is the focal statistics for minimum elevation and f s m a x i m u m is the focal statistics for maximum elevation and 2 h

used for classification analysis and are one of the most accepted ann techniques in artificial intelligence haykin 2008 zare et al 2013 in general an mlp model is more efficient than the conventional ann model and it is capable of analyzing a large dataset in an optimal way gardner and dorling 1998 like many other models mlp does not require any pre assumption for the allocation of training data to determine the relative importance of variables among the input factors the function of mlp is based on the input variables and these variables are selected by weighted parameters during the training phase and therefore no decisions are required by the user tien bui et al 2016 the structure of mlp consists of three layers i e input hidden and output the input layer is constructed based on the gpcfs the hidden layer processes the input variables and transformation in the output layer and finally the output layer gives the classified result of gwp and non potential zones a trial and error method is necessary for the most accurate results using mlp and hidden layers with several neuron values give the final output raheli et al 2017 essentially the mlp model has been trained using two main steps to develop output values the input layers are forwarded by the hidden layer and output values are evaluated through pre existing values to find out the distinction and weights are regulated to optimize the output result generating the least difference tien bui et al 2016 the following function description can be used to understand the mlp model assume that x x i where i 1 14 is the vector of 14 gwp causative factors and y 1 gwp points or y 0 non gwp points thus the basic function of mlp is as follows 4 y f x where f x represents the unknown function which is optimized by adjustable weights during the training phase of a neural network model the error that occurs during the training period is equal to the difference between network output o k and target output d k estimated by the following equation 5 e k d k o k the output error from the neural network is minimized by weight adjustments and is calculated using the following equation lee et al 2003 6 w i j n 1 Œ∑ Œ¥ j o i Œ± w i j n where w i j n 1 and w i j n represent the weight changes in epochs n 1 and n respectively Œ∑ is the learning rate parameter Œ¥ is the error change rate and Œ± is the momentum coefficient alkhasawneh et al 2013 2 2 3 2 na√Øve bayes tree in recent years several new ml models are used by researchers around the world hu et al 2015 zhao et al 2020 chen et al 2020a ma et al 2021 the combination of decision trees dts and na√Øve bayes nb has produced a hybrid algorithm called nbtree kohavi 1996 this model has been widely used to solve several classification problems arabameri et al 2020c the nbtree algorithm is exactly the same as the c4 5 dt quinlan 2014 except that nb categorizers are based on leaf nodes chen et al 2017b the nbtree model combines the advantages of the nb and dt models one of the greatest advantages of the nbtree model is that it uses minimal training data to evaluate the important parameters using a classification system pham et al 2017 besides the presence of an efficient inductive structure nbtree also has significant statistical importance in addition to this the nb model independence assumption can be fragile within the nbtree model raising the question of applicability thereafter the generating class with the highest probability has been determined based on the nb classification function hosseinalizadeh et al 2019 in the dt growth process it follows that the principle of entropy in attribute selection measure and splitting of attributes can be determined through information gain infogain split information splitinfo and information gain ratio gainratio these have been calculated using the following equations arabameri et al 2020c 7 i n f o g a i n a e n t r o p y d e n t r o p y a d 8 s p l i t i n f o i 1 n d i d l o g 2 d i d 9 g a i n r a t i o a i n f o g a i n a s p l i t i n f o a where d indicates the cases of the set that can be rearranged into subsets and represent as d i d and d i indicate the number of cases in d and d i and a is the respective attribute 2 2 3 3 classification and regression tree cart is a rule based ml method generated from the subset of a dt algorithm breiman et al 1984 the cart model is a non parametric method that usually identifies the elite subgroups of a population having the same characteristics that influence dependent factors lemon et al 2003 using a hierarchical structure a dt algorithm can simply interpret the classification and regression aims in comparison to other ml algorithms the cart model is known as a white box model because it is easy to find out the relationship between input and output factors kisi et al 2016 tiryaki 2008 one major advantage of the cart model is that no previous assumptions are needed regarding the relationship between variables thus the cart algorithm develops a binary tree and nodes are categorized into yes no answers for predictor values youssef et al 2016b the developed tree is called a classification tree if the dependent variables are qualitative and it is called a regression tree if they are quantitative hasanipanah et al 2017 in addition a maximum tree depth is necessary in the cart model to avoid tree outgrowth and overfitting problems the cart algorithm has the ability to identify and remove outliers during the splitting process in the cart algorithm the optimal sampling rule is based on the two child nodes comparison the following equation has been used to describe the cart algorithm 10 i s p l i t 0 25 q 1 q u k p l k p r k 2 where k indicates the target classes p l k and p r k represent the probability distribution of left and right target child nodes respectively and u indicates the splits developing unequal sized child nodes wu et al 2008 2 2 3 4 random subspace the rs algorithm is one of the most popular ensemble methods for classification and regression tree analysis rokach and maimon 2008 it is based on random sampling and was initially proposed by ho 1998 this method was developed to improve prediction performance of an individual classification and for accuracy assessment of a weak classification system wang and tang 2006 the rs method is similar to the bagging method of bootstrapping and aggregation the main difference between the two methods is that bagging bootstrapping uses training samples and rs bootstrapping uses feature space tao et al 2006 in general rs is used for reducing over fitting problems the function for the rs method is constructed based on four input variables training set base classifier and two subspace numbers represented by x w l and ds respectively skurichina and duin 2002 typically rs is an ensemble method that combines the outcome of replicated data in the algorithm arabameri et al 2020c in this ensemble method the vector is randomly separated to develop various subspaces subsequently different classification trees are randomly clustered into subspaces via a majority voting method skurichina and duin 2002 the majority of voting is used in the subspace ensemble system for the sample of xi and is calculated using the following equation 11 y i m v 1 i f j 1 p y i j p 2 0 i f j 1 p y i j p 2 where y i represents the output of the i th input of the xi sample p indicates the base classifiers and y i j is the output of the j th classifier of the i th input sample accordingly he et al 2020b 2 2 3 5 ensembles of mlp rs nbtree rs and cart rs algorithms we define the ensemble approach as the combination of multiple single statistical or ml algorithms chowdhuri et al 2020b ensemble methods provide better and more optimal prediction accuracy than single ml methods chen et al 2016 xu et al 2019 zhang et al 2021a b c hu et al 2021 thus several newly developed ensemble methods have been widely used in different fields of studies for susceptibility analysis with utmost accuracy arabameri et al 2020d the predictor values of mlp nbtree and cart have been used in the boosted ensemble algorithms then the rs model has run the second time and the output has been generated by the new hybrid ensemble model in this study we used three ensemble approaches for gwpz analysis mlp rs nbtree rs and cart rs carried out in the weka 3 8 4 and r data mining software 2 2 3 6 random forest method the rf method is a non parametric statistical ml algorithm that was developed based on cart ho 1998 it was primarily developed by breiman 2001 and is defined as a collection of binary dts chen et al 2021 rav√¨ et al 2016 this algorithm has the capability to solve classification and regression oriented problems the bagging approach is used during the formation of dts in the training phase the final result of the rf algorithm is estimated from the result of each dt rav√¨ et al 2016 the rf classifiers are based on the number of dts and the number of variable parameters belgiu and drƒÉgu≈£ 2016 the generalization error ge in the rf algorithm is calculated using the following equation 12 g e p x y m g x y 0 where p is the predictor x and y are gwp conditioning factors that represent the probability space x y and m g is a function expressed as 13 m g x y a v k i h k x y max j y a v k i h k x j where i is the indicator function j is a union of hyper rectangles and h k represents the union of hyper rectangles 2 2 3 7 logistic regression lr is a multivariate statistical technique that has been widely used in research on hazard related susceptibility analysis and in other studies chakrabortty et al 2020 chowdhuri et al 2020a it is based on the logit link function in a generalized linear method that enhances prediction accuracy by considering several conditioning factors yariyan et al 2020a generally multivariate regression relationships are developed in lr between the dependent dichotomous and independent categorical or interval variables atkinson and massari 1998 in this algorithm the dependent variables have one of two values i e event or non event and independent variables can be interpreted as a probability distribution dai and lee 2002 the lr always performs better in paired classifications i e for example a pair n x i y i where i 1 2 n and y i 1 1 is a type of binary class tag for each i 1 2 n and weights w b thus to accomplish the binary classification the model determining the probability of occurrence p is defined as follows 14 p y 1 ‡ß∑ x w 1 1 exp y w t x b where b represents the intercept mode t represents the transfer matrix and the k dimensional coefficient vector w w 1 w 2 w k t contains the parameters that need to be estimated 2 2 3 8 real adaboost the rab method also known as adaptive boosting is an ensemble ml algorithm developed by freund and schapire 1997 the advantage of rab is that it controls both the bias and the variance rab consecutively produces one classifier at a time all classifiers are trained on a sub dataset generated from the original dataset by gradually increasing the probability of difficult data samples at each stage tran et al 2020 the algorithm is based on two discrete values that are combined together for the final output hu and chen 2013 therefore the classification accuracy is increased through the combination of weak and strong learning algorithms huang et al 2004 rab has generally been used in ensemble approaches with multiple classifier algorithms 2 2 4 methods for model evaluation the optimal modelling of various scientific studies is greatly depends upon the checking of validation techniques and it is utmost necessary for optimal prediction performance analysis abedini et al 2020 abedini and zhang 2021a b alam et al 2020a b chao et al 2018 jiang et al 2017 sun et al 2020 xue et al 2020 yang et al 2015 the roc curve is used for validating binary value models arabameri et al 2020a shen et al 2016 li et al 2018 wang and chen 2020 using sensitivity sst and specificity spf the sst value and the value of 1 spf are plotted on the x and y axis respectively marzban 2004 where 15

vif 5 or tol 0 1 there exists a multi collinear linear relationship between two variables achour and pourghasemi 2020 the highest value of vif in our analysis was 4 505 the lowest tol was 0 222 table 1 these results confirm that no multi collinearity was evident between the gwcfs 3 2 groundwater potential maps gwp maps were drawn from the plotted spring positions and the mapped gwcf values output from the mlp nbtree cart mlp rs nbtree rs and cart rs methods the gwp values for these six models range from 0 to 100 likelihood to show the values on the maps they were classified into five classes very low low moderate high and very high potential using the common natural break classification method for constructing gpms naghibi et al 2017 fig 7 a f the very high and high groundwater potential classes distributed in the watershed area mostly around in the river system and low elevated areas which agreement with the study conducted by choubin et al 2019b in the mlp model most areas are correlated with very low 58 2 low 15 4 and moderate 9 2 potential and the remaining area is associated with high 7 3 and very high 10 0 potential in the nbtree model most areas are defined by very low 43 7 low 26 0 and moderate 11 8 gwp and the remaining area is associated with high 10 6 and very high 7 8 potential in the cart model most regions are defined by very low 36 7 low 40 1 and moderate 8 7 potential and the remaining area is associated with high 5 0 and very high 9 5 gwp the ensemble mlp rs model assigned very low potential to 62 7 of the study area and very high potential to 11 4 fig 8 the nbtree rs model assigned very low potential to 61 7 and very high potential to 13 7 finally the cart rs model assigned very low potential to 78 6 low to 10 5 moderate to 2 5 high to 3 5 and very high to 4 8 of the study area 3 3 validation of groundwater potential maps the gwp maps produced from the ensemble models were compared to those generated by the three standalone models using the roc curve sst spf f score accuracy acc and kappa k fig 9 a and b the models were evaluated and validated using the confusion matrix for the validation 30 of all data and training 70 of all data datasets of spring locations see supplementary table 3 the results indicate that the mlp rs model fig 10 a and b had an auc value of 0 981 based on the training dataset and an auc value of 0 976 based on the validation dataset this model appears to outperform the other models when producing gpms based on the other five statistics the mlp rs ensemble made the best prediction of gwp fig 9a and b training

achieved acceptable gpm results as well mlp auc 0 935 0 879 cart auc 0 936 0 857 and nbtree auc 0 921 0 853 see fig 10a and b the freidman and wilcoxon rank tests were used to verify the applicability of the six gwp models the purpose of these statistical analyses is to determine any substantial variations between two or more models tien bui et al 2018 the rank test results showed that the mean rank values for the mlp rs cart rs nbtree rs mlp cart and nbtree models were 3 842 3 402 2 743 2 450 1 951 and 1 254 respectively moreover the high chi square value 74 531 and low significance value 0 of all the models indicate that there was a significant difference in the results between the models table 2 furthermore the wilcoxon signed rank test was used to evaluate pair wise algorithms this test uses p value and z value parameters such that when p 0 05 and 1 96 z 1 96 this suggests that the efficiency of the models in preparing the gwp maps differed substantially khosravi et al 2018a our test findings shown in supplementary table 4 explicitly determine that the efficiency of all gwp models had statistically significant pair wise variations 3 4 analyzing the importance of groundwater conditioning factors gwcfs were chosen on the basis of field observations and a literature review chen et al 2019a pham et al 2019 there is no specific procedure for assessing the value of each of the variables influencing groundwater capacity assessing the relative importance of each gwcf is necessary for recognizing the most significant effects on the existence of groundwater moghaddam et al 2020a nguyen et al 2020c we used three models to assess the relative importance of each variable lr rf and rab the rab model fig 11 indicates that slope elevation and tri are of primary importance for predicting gwp locations in the study area these were followed in order by hand dtf dd curvature rainfall fd lulc tst dts aspect and lithology the mean decrease in gini mdg and mean decrease in accuracy mda can be used to approximate the importance of each gwcf in the rf modeling process hollister et al 2016 the results indicate that all gwcfs were used in the modeling of gwp but elevation tst tri rainfall and slope were the most significant fig 12 a and b in determining the relative importance of the 14 variables used in the lr model we found that lithology lulc and dts were the most significant factors table 3 we calculated the correlation coefficient between the spring and geo environmental factors of groundwater to determine the linear relationships between springs and factors affecting them table 4 the results depicted that most of the factors were negatively correlated to springs factors such as elevation tst tri and dd had a strong correlation with springs r 0 85 0 82 0 81 and 0 75 respectively conversely lithology r 0 41 distance to stream r 0 42 distance to fault r 0 46 aspect r 0 48 hand r 0 53 curvature r 0 57 and rainfall r 0 57 had a weak correlation with springs the remaining factors were moderately correlated with springs 4 discussion groundwater resources are important to agriculture manufacturing and for consumption in many regions of the world pal et al 2020 van hoang and hoa 2014 gpms may be a successful method for guiding proper management of surface and subsurface water supplies despite gpm efforts using different approaches khosravi et al 2019 tien bui et al 2019 regional studies are still needed to acquire results suitable for water management the most meaningful results appear to include the use of geophysical and hydrological variables describing subsurface conditions each of the methods used to develop gpms has advantages and disadvantages with development of remote sensing and gis yang et al 2019 ml and fuzzy models have gained significant research attention in recent years bui et al 2019 van dao et al 2020 because they are so applicable to the modeling of spatial data moayedi et al 2019b one of the benefits of ml modeling is that it eliminates the limitations caused by a lack of accurate data and the difficult integration of topographic and hydrological data mehrabi et al 2020 moayedi et al 2019a zhang et al 2021a b c because of the drawbacks and limits of each machine learning and statistical model xia et al 2017 yu et al 2020 2021 researchers have suggested and created integrated techniques to overcome their drawbacks and boost their performance wang et al 2017 zhao et al 2019 wang and chen 2020 tu et al 2021 shan et al 2021 the results of our study show that of the six models the mlp rs hybrid ensemble had the best gwp prediction accuracy our validation resulted in auc values ranging from 0 853 0 976 for the six models we consider these to be very reasonable modeling results rs ensemble based ml approaches are well known methods that are applied to multiple classifiers choubin et al 2019a the rs method takes full advantage of numerous classifiers to determine trees avoiding the weaker single dt process nhu et al 2020 nguyen et al 2020a also demonstrated the advantage of using a hybrid of the rs and lr models for gpm in dak lak province vietnam hybrid ml ensemble techniques have been used to build the best groundwater prediction models and to handle complex multi dimensional data easily miraki et al 2019 the benchmark established models mlp cart and nbtree have produced good results the performances of these benchmark models have been described as favorable as our results also validate chen et al 2017a used mlp youssef et al 2016a used cart and moghaddam et al 2020b and arabameri et al 2020b used nbtree mosavi et al 2021 established random forest rf outperforms in comparison with the ensemble models of bagged classification and regression trees bagged cart adaptive boosting classification trees adaboost and boosted generalized additive model gamboost sajedi hosseini et al 2018 applied three machine learning models including boosted regression trees brt

et al 2019 estimating the uncertainty of models for modelling nitrate contamination of groundwater in part of iran using three state of the art machine learning models including support vector machine svm random forest rf and k nearest neighbor knn however there are very few differences between models in the precision of gwp modeling the results from the mlp rs model show better prediction capability for mapping gwp than the other models for the training dataset auc 0 981 acc 0 796 sst 0 796 spf 0 796 f score 0 796 and kappa 0 722 and for the validating dataset auc 0 976 acc 0 752 sst 0

type of input dataset in this analysis since dems give more precise results we used the alos palsar dem which has a high spatial resolution 12 5 m to extract the topographic factors the 14 geo environmental factors were considered groundwater determinant factors after the multi collinearity test giving vif and tol values determining significant variables for groundwater storage is a very complex problem in this study the rf model was used to evaluate significant variables slope elevation tri hand dtf dd curvature and rainfall were the dominant factors similar studies have reported that topographic factors soil cover geological features e g lithology fd and dtf and hydrological factors affect rates of water infiltration and increase groundwater volume rainfall is one of the most significant elements in hydrology and has been recognized as a major source of aquifer recharge razandi et al 2015 rainfall land use and lithology are the most critical factors in this research this is reasonable since runoff influences the recharge and reinforcement of water sources the tabriz river basin has high dome and cone shaped hills medium relative slopes and shorter slope lengths as the rainfall from the upper regions accumulates in the lower regions the tri indicates the difference in altitude between two neighboring areas in open terrain adiat et al 2012 found that precipitation has a large influence on percolation and gpm ozdemir 2011 suggested that topographic factors like elevation and slope have inverse relationships with gwp and that twi and dd have direct relationships which is supported by our correlation values between the gwcfs and springs evaluating the importance of effective factors in modeling can be valuable to managers enabling more robust decision making in this study we found slope elevation tri hand dtf rainfall lithology lulc and dd to be the most important predictors of the spatial distribution of gwp lithology and lulc can influence the permeability of soils and rock formations and influence gwp singh et al 2010 chen et al 2020a also identified the importance of geology and lulc therefore all characteristics topography environment hydrology and geology have an important influence on gwp guru et al 2017 reported that water table depth lineament density slope and dd had a greater effect on gwp and geology and land use seemed less important pourghasemi et al 2018 and kamali maskooni et al 2020 showed that lulc is not an important factor for gwp in semi arid regions the concentration of springs in geological formations like ash deposits and associated volcanic rocks the low level piedmont fan and the valley terrace deposits confirm high potential for groundwater in the southwestern region of the tabriz river basin it is also important to note the high importance of topographic factors such as elevation slope and tri in predicting gwp patterns validation of the gwp models demonstrated their outstanding performance and the ensemble models mlp rs cart rs and nbtree rs were more capable than the individual models such hybrid ensemble models have been shown to produce more accurate results than other individual models when developed for gpms in other study areas al fugara et al 2020 arabameri et al 2020e nguyen et al 2020b the correct methods are capable of producing gpms and can be used by decision makers for planning purposes the applied ml ensemble and hybrid models have excellent precision and can be used in the tabriz river basin region for groundwater management 5 conclusions this study evaluated the performance of the mlp rs cart rs and nbtree rs ensemble ml models in mapping gwp the results showed that the models were very accurate surpassing the three standalone models that were used as benchmarks mlp cart and nbtree the relative importance of gwcfs was assessed using three techniques rf lr and rab all six ml models in this study achieved good accuracy auc 0 85 however there were differences in their performances when using different validation methods mlp rs had the best accuracy training validation auc 0 981 0 976 acc 0 796 0 788 sst 0 796 0 788 spf 0 796 0 788 f score 0 796 0 788 and k 0 722 0 705 followed by cart rs then the nbtree rs ensemble model slope elevation tri hand dtf rainfall lithology lulc and dd were the most important gwcfs these characteristics may be used by managers and other decision makers to determine the possible distribution of groundwater without the need for more involved modeling efforts this knowledge can aid the understanding of current conditions in various regions of the tabriz basin and can be used to plan and monitor groundwater extraction future research efforts should assess other conditioning factors for model performance in terms of time and cost of acquisition and whether they can be used to predict groundwater distribution more easily the implementation of other environmental topographic hydrological and lithological factors into the development of gpms may also improve the reliability of the model results using hybrid ensemble models the drawbacks and problems resulting from using less robust stand alone models

models can support sustainable management of groundwater resources keywords groundwater machine learning random subspace ensemble models rs gis iran 1 introduction the demand for groundwater resources has increased in urban and rural regions due to increasing population and industrialization of agricultural irrigation he et al 2020a taweesin et al 2018 over the last few decades water crises have emerged in heavily populated regions currently maintenance and optimal usage of water supplies are among the most critical concerns chezgi et al 2016 das and pal 2020 lu et al 2019 drought has put more pressure on water resources and the need for successful management of groundwater has become crucial feng et al 2020 nguyen et al 2020a groundwater is one of the most affordable water supply choices for homes agriculture and other uses arabameri et al 2020e the day to day demand for groundwater is increasing in the aforementioned fields which is exhausting the known natural aquifers adeyeye et al 2019 therefore groundwater potential gwp mapping may be critical in the creation of water basin management plans gwp refers to the probability of the occurrence of groundwater or the amount of groundwater storage within a region khosravi et al 2018b the lack of data indicating the existence or absence of groundwater in parts of the basins together with the small number of speculative groundwater wells that can be identified lead to regional hydrological mismanagement fashae et al 2014 over the last decade given the development of photogrammetry gis and rs han et al 2019 hu et al 2020 niu et al 2020 yang and sowmya 2015 zhang et al 2020 zuo et al 2015 2017 numerous new models and algorithms have been developed by researchers worldwide jiang et al 2018 li et al 2020 qu et al 2021 yin et al 2021 determination of gwp zones gwpzs involves the study of various lithological and geomorphological units berhanu and hatiye 2020 sander et al 1996 srivastava and bhattacharya 2006 to project their trends into unexplored areas several approaches have been evaluated for their usefulness in mapping gwp integration of remote sensing with geographic information systems giss as a versatile tool has greatly increased the accuracy of gwpzs abijith et al 2020 in recent years several attempts have been made by various researchers to determine the gwp in different regions of the world adeyeye et al 2019 arabameri et al 2019 chen et al 2018 zhang et al 2019a in some studies basic common mathematical models have been used to assess gwp such as the analytical hierarchy process ahp rahmati et al 2015 frequency ratio guru et al 2017 weights of evidence woe al abadi 2015 evidential belief function ebf nampak et al 2014 certainty factor razandi et al 2015 logistic regression lr nguyen et al 2020a and artificial neural networks anns lee et al 2018 in semi quantitative models like the ahp expert opinions have been used to tune them but for similar geo environmental factors or for the same location the models require long term knowledge of the groundwater and causal factors which are not available in most cases akgun 2012 statistical techniques are commonly considered the most suitable method for gwp mapping at scales from 1 20 000 to 1 50 000 because springs and wells can be mapped in detail dai et al 2001 additionally various studies have illustrated applicable ensemble methods using the previously mentioned models such as ebf and boosted regression tree brt kordestani et al 2019 woe and lr chen et al 2018 ebf and tree based models naghibi et al 2019 and ann and real adaboost rab nguyen et al 2020b to create gwp maps gpms however statistical models do not consider nonlinear relationships and as a result artificial intelligence based machine learning ml models have been developed ml approaches based on data mining have determined the conditions required to improve groundwater capacity models evaluated for gwpz mapping include the classification and regression tree cart naghibi et al 2019 random forest rf rahmati et al 2016 multivariate adaptive regression splines mars golkarian et al 2018 brt naghibi et al 2016 decision stumps pham et al 2019 alternating decision trees adtree chen et al 2020a anns nguyen et al 2020b and support vector machines svms chen et al 2019b the goal of each is to find the most economical and efficient procedure note also that using field evidence in gis based models improves results adeyeye 2015 for greater accuracy in gwp mapping the use of hybrid learning models has been greatly enhanced chen et al 2020b proposed using decision algorithms based on j48 trees adaptive boosting or adaboost bagging random subspace rs dagging and rotation forest hereafter j48 ab bag rs dag and rof respectively to identify locations with gwp pham et al 2019 carried out a comparative study of the simple decision stumps classifier and three orthogonal forest multi boost and bagging methods more recently to achieve greater reliability various hybrid ensemble ml models have been suggested combining a base model with optimization algorithms or ensemble techniques for example al fugara et al 2020 combined svm and genetic algorithms to construct a hybrid model in the jerash and ajloun region of jordan miraki et al 2019 developed an ensemble model combining the rs and rf rs rf classifier methods to map the gwp of the qorveh dehgolan plain in iran nguyen et al nguyen et al 2020b proposed an ensemble model combining an ann with real adaptive boosting ann rab for assessment of the gpm in daknong province in vietnam these three ensemble experiments have shown that hybrid ensemble models have better predictive performance than single classifier models therefore ml ensemble models and their hybrids demonstrate good capability for the development of reliable gpms in this study the main objective was to assess gwp by applying three novel ensemble models combining the accurate rs ml method with multilayer perceptron mlp na√Øve bayes tree nbtree and the cart ensemble technique hereafter mlp rs nbtree rs and cart rs respectively in addition the three single models are assessed mlp nbtree and cart the gpms of the single models are benchmarks against which the results of the hybrid models are evaluated the mlp nbtree and cart algorithms have been applied separately in landslide flood and gully erosion susceptibility mapping as well as in groundwater and spring potentiality mapping in the literature we found that each of the benchmark models predicted the best result when compared with other models chen et al 2017a applied the dempster shafer lr and mlp algorithms in an ann model for landslide susceptibility mapping lsm the ann had the best accuracy 69 62 zare et al 2013 applied mlp and the radial basic function in an ann for lsm the mlp algorithm had the best accuracy 88 1 arabameri et al 2020b applied three models adtree nbtree and logistic model tree to gully erosion susceptibility mapping nbtree was the second best predictive model area under curve auc 93 9 youssef et al 2016a applied four modeling techniques rf brt cart and a general linear model the cart model had the highest accuracy 86 2 usually the construction of hybrid ensemble models is interesting research that has gained growing interest for understanding and solving a wide range of geo hydrological and geotechnical problems including groundwater prediction and evaluation pham et al 2020 although many hybrid ensemble models were designed but the ensemble of random subspace rs learner based modeling of landslide susceptibility using different artificial intelligence based tree classifiers was not attempted earlier significantly these models were applied in one of the spring potential areas of northwest iran namely the tabriz river basin to select the best model for the accurate groundwater potentiality mapping thus we use mlp nbtree and cart as benchmark models in determining the accuracy of the new ensemble models in addition the introduction of train surface texture tst is innovative in this study this new factor is tested for its effect on prediction accuracy assessment of the relative importance of each factor has been determined for lr rf and rab and the accuracy of each model was evaluated using the area under the curve of receiver operating characteristic roc collectively auroc f score and kappa k index 2 data and methodology 2 1 study area the tabriz river basin is situated in northwestern iran in the region spanned by 37 48 00 38 24 00 n and 45 36 00 46 48 00 e fig 1 it occupies a surface area of approximately 5397 km2 elevations vary from 1274 to 3678 m above sea level and slope angles range from 0 to 150 9 the average annual minimum and maximum temperatures are 2 c and 12 c respectively the average annual rainfall ranges from 243 to 641 mm and the northern and southern parts of the basin receive the highest amounts there are also many climates in the study region that are primarily marked by humidity very hot humid semi humid semi arid and mediterranean the region is associated with numerous lithological formations

the next largest areas fig 2 zhang et al 2016 2 2 methodology the methodological approach used in the current research study is discussed in the following section and the respective flowchart is shown in fig 3 to progress of this study a groundwater spring inventory map was prepared based on the 200 spring locations in the study area which were identified through field survey with global positioning system gps and historical records from the iran water resources management company iwrmc and non spring points were chosen randomly throughout the study area using arcgis 10 4 software saha et al 2021a 2021b afterward a total of fourteen geophysical factors namely curvature elevation aspect dtf hand fd dd lithology lulc rainfall slope dts tst and tri were selected through a review of the literature and local feo environmental conditions to serves independent variables that may predict gwp areas along with this multi collinearity test of the above all factors were conducted with variance inflation factor vif and tolerance tol tools in spss 21 zainodin et al 2011 the relative importance and effectiveness of all the geo environmental factors were determined using logistic regression lr random forest rf and real adaboost rab in a regression analysis the lr model can provide coefficient property for each selected variables and these coefficient can also provide optimal feature importance score on the other hand rf model have the ability to handle large dataset and analysis nonlinearities among the variables and calculate variables importance accordingly catani et al 2013 rab have the advantages to improve the performance and accuracy of machine learning based classification problems chen and li 2020 finally gwp maps were prepared using the mlp nbtree cart mlp rs nbtree rs and cart rs machine learning and ensemble models the ensemble approaches used in this study were analysis in the statistical package of r 4 0 5 chowdhuri et al 2020b and weka 3 8 4 pham et al 2019 thereafter the models performances were validated and evaluated using auroc f score and kappa index respectively valivation of results have a key role in scientific works zhang et al 2019a b ju et al 2020 yang et al 2020a b alam et al 2020a b abedini and zhang 2020 zhang et al 2021a b c fang et al 2021 2 2 1 spring inventory map springs are described as positions or points on the earth s surface where water emerges from underneath the ground springs may form when unconfined aquifers break through the surface manga 2001 springs develop where streams are eroded so deeply through the valley walls that the aquifer is visible and spring lines appear spring is the transformation of groundwater into surface water hu et al 2007 springs are strong sources of gwp examining the distribution of the positions of both historical and contemporary springs it may be possible to forecast the future groundwater capacity of the region therefore a spring inventory map was compiled from data archived by the iwrmc and the locations of the springs were cross examined using handheld gps during a field survey fig 4 in total 205 springs were identified in the study area of which 144 70 were randomly selected for model training and the remaining 61 30 for validation fig 5 non spring points were extracted where there were no springs to the surface non spring locations have also been created in arcgis v10 4 for modeling gwp and also split into training and validation datasets 2 2 2 groundwater conditioning factors based on the research area and field observations geophysical and environmental characteristics were chosen to model the gwp by forecasting spring locations fourteen groundwater conditioning factors gwcfs were chosen curvature elevation aspect distance to fault dtf height above nearest drainage hand fault density fd drainage density dd lithology land use and land cover lulc rainfall slope distance to stream dts tst and tri terrain ruggedness index see supplementary table 2 the gwcf data were measured and mapped at a spatial resolution of 12 5 m in arcgis an alos palsar digital elevation model dem with special resolution of 12 5 m was used to determine values for curvature slope elevation aspect hand tst tri and dts and dd geological factors lithology dtf and fd were employed in the identification of gwpz the lithology of the study region was derived from a geological map developed at a scale of 1 50 000 by the geological survey of iran the study area contains nine different lithological units mur murm qsf plat plmb1 plmb2 qft2 omq see supplementary table 1 the dtf and fd maps were prepared from the geological map the recti linearity of geological structures faults and fractures reflects the influence of a phenomenon that occurs below the surface ground such as water recharge benjmel et al 2020 the distance from faults was mapped to discover any relation between faults and groundwater and created by euclidean distance choubin et al 2019b recently the phenomenon of climate change has been adversely affected on hydrological cycle of basins and alters the magnitude and pattern of stream flow and affected environmental sustainability and water resources tian et al 2020 wang et al 2021 zhang et al 2019a the hydrological factors rainfall dts and dd are important for indicating the potential for water and groundwater lee et al 2020 rainfall is one of the most significant variables in the potential model for groundwater and the larger the precipitation area the greater the potential for groundwater oikonomidis et al 2015 rainfall is a hydrological method to regenerate aquifers magesh et al 2012 the groundwater level fluctuates with almost the same period as rainfall nguyen et al 2020b in this analysis the average annual rainfall data were collected from the iran meteorological organization the rainfall map was prepared with meteorological data from the 20 year period 2000 2019 using kriging interpolation in arcgis v10 4 rainfall has a substantial effect on groundwater capacity and its production because it has a significant effect on the volume of water entering the groundwater system yu and lin 2015 very high elevations have less potential for springs than medium to low elevations due to more runoff occurring at the latter contributing to recharge avand et al 2020 aspect indicates slope direction which affects the amount and intensity of rainfall i e windward slopes are more favorable for rainfall than leeward slopes solomon and quiel 2006 this has an indirect effect on the amount of water infiltrating the earth and thus affecting groundwater concave surfaces hold more water particularly during times of heavy rainfall pham et al 2019 dts and dd were determined from a map of the river network in arcgis lulc is another significant factor impacting groundwater recharging capability anthropogenic activities and climate change are the primary causes of changes in stream flow the lulc map was taken from 2018 landsat 8 data at a spatial resolution of 12 5 m see supplementary table 2 all gwcfs were mapped as shown in fig 6 a n the hydraulic conductivity of an area is also affected by soil structure of that area xu et al 2021 tst factor calculated with saga gis software the hand normalizes topography based on the local relative heights from the drainage lines presenting the topology of relative soil gravitational potentials or local draining potentials rahmati et al 2018 nobre et al 2011 showed that hand has a high association with the depth of the water table giving a reliable spatial depiction of soil water conditions the statistical equations for tri and hand are as follows 1 t r i f s m e a n f s m i n i m u m f s m a x i m u m f s m i n i m u m where f s m e a n is the focal statistics for mean elevation f s m i n i m u m is the focal statistics for minimum elevation and f s m a x i m u m is the focal statistics for maximum elevation and 2 h a n d p i k d r o p i k h k p i k where p i k is the proportion of grid cell i that drains to grid cell k h is the vertical drop from a grid cell to the drainage and drop i k is the change in elevation from i to k defined as 3 d r o p i k z i z k where z is the elevation for a grid cell zheng et al 2018 2 2 3 model descriptions 2 2 3 1 multilayer perceptron mlp neural networks are usually used for classification analysis and are one of the most accepted ann techniques in artificial intelligence haykin 2008 zare et al 2013 in general an mlp model is more efficient than the conventional ann model and it is capable of analyzing a large dataset in an optimal way gardner and dorling 1998 like many other models mlp does not require any pre assumption for the allocation of training data to determine the relative importance of variables among the input factors the function of mlp is based on the input variables and these variables are selected by weighted parameters during the training phase and therefore no decisions are required by the user tien bui et al 2016 the structure of mlp consists of three layers i e input hidden and output the input layer is constructed based on the gpcfs the hidden layer processes the input variables and transformation in the output layer and finally the output layer gives the classified result of gwp and non potential zones a trial and error method is necessary for the most accurate results using mlp and hidden layers with several neuron values give the final output raheli et al 2017 essentially the mlp model has been trained using two main steps to develop output values the input layers are forwarded by the hidden layer and output values are evaluated through pre existing values to find out the distinction and weights are regulated to optimize the output result generating the least difference tien bui et al 2016 the following function description can be used to understand the mlp model assume that x x i where i 1 14 is the vector of 14 gwp causative factors and y 1 gwp points or y 0 non gwp points thus the basic function of mlp is as follows 4 y f x where f x represents the unknown function which is optimized by adjustable weights during the training phase of a neural network model the error that occurs during the training period is equal to the difference between network output o k and target output d k estimated by the following equation 5 e k d k o k the output error from the neural network is minimized by weight adjustments and is calculated using the following equation lee et al 2003 6 w i j n 1 Œ∑ Œ¥ j o i Œ± w i j n where w i j n 1 and w i j n represent the weight changes in epochs n 1 and n respectively Œ∑ is the learning rate parameter Œ¥ is the error change rate and Œ± is the momentum coefficient alkhasawneh et al 2013 2 2 3 2 na√Øve bayes tree in recent years several new ml models are used by researchers around the world hu et al 2015 zhao et al 2020 chen et al 2020a ma et al 2021 the combination of decision trees dts and na√Øve bayes nb has produced a hybrid algorithm called nbtree kohavi 1996 this model has been widely used to solve several classification problems arabameri et al 2020c the nbtree algorithm is exactly the same as the c4 5 dt quinlan 2014 except that nb categorizers are based on leaf nodes chen et al 2017b the nbtree model combines the advantages of the nb and dt models one of the greatest advantages of the nbtree model is that it uses minimal training data to evaluate the important parameters using a classification system pham et al 2017 besides the presence of an efficient inductive structure nbtree also has significant statistical importance in addition to this the nb model independence assumption can be fragile within the nbtree model raising the question of applicability thereafter the generating class with the highest probability has been determined based on the nb classification function hosseinalizadeh et al 2019 in the dt growth process it follows that the principle of entropy in attribute selection measure and splitting of attributes can be determined through information gain infogain split information splitinfo and information gain ratio gainratio these have been calculated using the following equations arabameri et al 2020c 7 i n f o g a i n a e n t r o p y d e n t r o p y a d 8 s p l i t i n f o i 1 n d i d l o g 2 d i d 9 g a i n r a t i o a i n f o g a i n a s p l i t i n f o a where d indicates the cases of the set that can be rearranged into subsets and represent as d i d and d i indicate the number of cases in d and d i and a is the respective attribute 2 2 3 3 classification and regression tree cart is a rule based ml method generated from the subset of a dt algorithm breiman et al 1984 the cart model is a non parametric method that usually identifies the elite subgroups of a population having the same characteristics that influence dependent factors lemon et al 2003 using a hierarchical structure a dt algorithm can simply interpret the classification and regression aims in comparison to other ml algorithms the cart model is known as a white box model because it is easy to find out the relationship between input and output factors kisi et al 2016 tiryaki 2008 one major advantage of the cart model is that no previous assumptions are needed regarding the relationship between variables thus the cart algorithm develops a binary tree and nodes are categorized into yes no answers for predictor values youssef et al 2016b the developed tree is called a classification tree if the dependent variables are qualitative and it is called a regression tree if they are quantitative hasanipanah et al 2017 in addition a maximum tree depth is necessary in the cart model to avoid tree outgrowth and overfitting problems the cart algorithm has the ability to identify and remove outliers during the splitting process in the cart algorithm the optimal sampling rule is based on the two child nodes comparison the following equation has been used to describe the cart algorithm 10 i s p l i t 0 25 q 1 q u k p l k p r k 2 where k indicates the target classes p l k and p r k represent the probability distribution of left and right target child nodes respectively and u indicates the splits developing unequal sized child nodes wu et al 2008 2 2 3 4 random subspace the rs algorithm is one of the most popular ensemble methods for classification and regression tree analysis rokach and maimon 2008 it is based on random sampling and was initially proposed by ho 1998 this method was developed to improve prediction performance of an individual classification and for accuracy assessment of a weak classification system wang and tang 2006 the rs method is similar to the bagging method of bootstrapping and aggregation the main difference between the two methods is that bagging bootstrapping uses training samples and rs bootstrapping uses feature space tao et al 2006 in general rs is used for reducing over fitting problems the function for the rs method is constructed based on four input variables training set base classifier and two subspace numbers represented by x w l and ds respectively skurichina and duin 2002 typically rs is an ensemble method that combines the outcome of replicated data in the algorithm arabameri et al 2020c in this ensemble method the vector is randomly separated to develop various subspaces subsequently different classification trees are randomly clustered into subspaces via a majority voting method skurichina and duin 2002 the majority of voting is used in the subspace ensemble system for the sample of xi and is calculated using the following equation 11 y i m v 1 i f j 1 p y i j p 2 0 i f j 1 p y i j p 2 where y i represents the output of the i th input of the xi sample p indicates the base classifiers and y i j is the output of the j th classifier of the i th input sample accordingly he et al 2020b 2 2 3 5 ensembles of mlp rs nbtree rs and cart rs algorithms we define the ensemble approach as the combination of multiple single statistical or ml algorithms chowdhuri et al 2020b ensemble methods provide better and more optimal prediction accuracy than single ml methods chen et al 2016 xu et al 2019 zhang et al 2021a b c hu et al 2021 thus several newly developed ensemble methods have been widely used in different fields of studies for susceptibility analysis with utmost accuracy arabameri et al 2020d the predictor values of mlp nbtree and cart have been used in the boosted ensemble algorithms then the rs model has run the second time and the output has been generated by the new hybrid ensemble model in this study we used three ensemble approaches for gwpz analysis mlp rs nbtree rs and cart rs carried out in the weka 3 8 4 and r data mining software 2 2 3 6 random forest method the rf method is a non parametric statistical ml algorithm that was developed based on cart ho 1998 it was primarily developed by breiman 2001 and is defined as a collection of binary dts chen et al 2021 rav√¨ et al 2016 this algorithm has the capability to solve classification and regression oriented problems the bagging approach is used during the formation of dts in the training phase the final result of the rf algorithm is estimated from the result of each dt rav√¨ et al 2016 the rf classifiers are based on the number of dts and the number of variable parameters belgiu and drƒÉgu≈£ 2016 the generalization error ge in the rf algorithm is calculated using the following equation 12 g e p x y m g x y 0 where p is the predictor x and y are gwp conditioning factors that represent the probability space x y and m g is a function expressed as 13 m g x y a v k i h k x y max j y a v k i h k x j where i is the indicator function j is a union of hyper rectangles and h k represents the union of hyper rectangles 2 2 3 7 logistic regression lr is a multivariate statistical technique that has been widely used in research on hazard related susceptibility analysis and in other studies chakrabortty et al 2020 chowdhuri et al 2020a it is based on the logit link function in a generalized linear method that enhances prediction accuracy by considering several conditioning factors yariyan et al 2020a generally multivariate regression relationships are developed in lr between the dependent dichotomous and independent categorical or interval variables atkinson and massari 1998 in this algorithm the dependent variables have one of two values i e event or non event and independent variables can be interpreted as a probability distribution dai and lee 2002 the lr always performs better in paired classifications i e for example a pair n x i y i where i 1 2 n and y i 1 1 is a type of binary class tag for each i 1 2 n and weights w b thus to accomplish the binary classification the model determining the probability of occurrence p is defined as follows 14 p y 1 ‡ß∑ x w 1 1 exp y w t x b where b represents the intercept mode t represents the transfer matrix and the k dimensional coefficient vector w w 1 w 2 w k t contains the parameters that need to be estimated 2 2 3 8 real adaboost the rab method also known as adaptive boosting is an ensemble ml algorithm developed by freund and schapire 1997 the advantage of rab is that it controls both the bias and the variance rab consecutively produces one classifier at a time all classifiers are trained on a sub dataset generated from the original dataset by gradually increasing the probability of difficult data samples at each stage tran et al 2020 the algorithm is based on two discrete values that are combined together for the final output hu and chen 2013 therefore the classification accuracy is increased through the combination of weak and strong learning algorithms huang et al 2004 rab has generally been used in ensemble approaches with multiple classifier algorithms 2 2 4 methods for model evaluation the optimal modelling of various scientific studies is greatly depends upon the checking of validation techniques and it is utmost necessary for optimal prediction performance analysis abedini et al 2020

from the mlp nbtree cart mlp rs nbtree rs and cart rs methods the gwp values for these six models range from 0 to 100 likelihood to show the values on the maps they were classified into five classes very low low moderate high and very high potential using the common natural break classification method for constructing gpms naghibi et al 2017 fig 7 a f the very high and high groundwater potential classes distributed in the watershed area mostly around in the river system and low elevated areas which agreement with the study conducted by choubin et al 2019b in the mlp model most areas are correlated with very low 58 2 low 15 4 and moderate 9 2 potential and the remaining area is associated with high 7 3 and very high 10 0 potential in the nbtree model most areas are defined by very low

high to 4 8 of the study area 3 3 validation of groundwater potential maps the gwp maps produced from the ensemble models were compared to those generated by the three standalone models using the roc

of the six gwp models the purpose of these statistical analyses is to determine any substantial variations between two or more models tien bui et al 2018 the rank test results showed that the mean rank values for the mlp rs cart rs nbtree rs mlp cart and nbtree models were 3 842 3 402 2 743 2 450 1 951 and 1 254 respectively moreover the high chi square value 74 531 and low significance value 0 of all the models indicate that there was a significant difference in the results between the models table 2 furthermore the wilcoxon signed rank test was used to evaluate pair wise algorithms this test uses p value and z value parameters such that when p 0 05 and 1 96 z 1 96 this suggests that the efficiency of the models in preparing the gwp maps differed substantially khosravi et al 2018a our test findings shown in supplementary table 4 explicitly determine that the efficiency of all gwp models had statistically significant pair wise variations 3 4 analyzing the importance of groundwater conditioning factors gwcfs were chosen on the basis of field observations and a literature review chen et al 2019a pham et al 2019 there is no specific procedure for assessing the value of each of the variables influencing groundwater capacity assessing the relative importance of each gwcf is necessary for recognizing the most significant effects on the existence of groundwater moghaddam et al 2020a nguyen et al 2020c we used three models to assess the relative importance of each variable lr rf and rab the rab model fig 11 indicates that slope elevation and tri are of primary importance for predicting gwp locations in the study area these were followed in order by hand dtf dd curvature rainfall fd lulc tst dts aspect and lithology the mean decrease in gini mdg and mean decrease in accuracy mda can be used to approximate the importance of each gwcf in the rf modeling process hollister et al 2016 the results indicate that all gwcfs were used in the modeling of gwp but elevation tst tri rainfall and slope were the most significant fig 12 a and b in determining the relative importance of the 14 variables used in the lr model we found that lithology lulc and dts were the most significant factors table 3 we calculated the correlation coefficient between the spring and geo environmental factors of groundwater to determine the linear relationships between springs and factors affecting them table 4 the results depicted that most of the factors were negatively correlated to springs factors such as elevation tst tri and dd had a strong correlation with springs r 0 85 0 82 0 81 and 0 75 respectively conversely lithology r 0 41 distance to stream r 0 42 distance to fault r 0 46 aspect r 0 48 hand r 0 53 curvature r 0 57 and rainfall r 0 57 had a weak correlation with springs the remaining factors were moderately correlated with springs 4 discussion groundwater resources are important to agriculture manufacturing and for consumption in many regions of the world pal et al 2020 van hoang and hoa 2014 gpms may be a successful method for guiding proper management of surface and subsurface water supplies despite gpm efforts using different approaches khosravi et al 2019 tien bui et al 2019 regional studies are still needed to acquire results suitable for water management the most meaningful results appear to include the use of geophysical and hydrological variables describing subsurface conditions each of the methods used to develop gpms has advantages and disadvantages with development of remote sensing and gis yang et al 2019 ml and fuzzy models have gained significant research attention in recent years bui et al 2019 van dao et al 2020 because they are so applicable to the modeling of spatial data moayedi et al 2019b one of the benefits of ml modeling is that it eliminates the limitations caused by a lack of accurate data and the difficult integration of topographic and hydrological data mehrabi et al 2020 moayedi et al 2019a zhang et al 2021a b c because of the drawbacks and limits of each machine learning and statistical model xia et al 2017 yu et al 2020 2021 researchers have suggested and created integrated techniques to overcome their drawbacks and boost their performance wang et al 2017 zhao et al 2019 wang and chen 2020 tu et al 2021 shan et al 2021 the results of our study show that of the six models the mlp rs hybrid ensemble had the best gwp prediction accuracy our validation resulted in auc values ranging from 0 853 0 976 for the six models we consider these to be very reasonable modeling results rs ensemble based ml approaches are well known methods that are applied to multiple classifiers choubin et al 2019a the rs method takes full advantage of numerous classifiers to determine trees avoiding the weaker single dt process nhu et al 2020 nguyen et al 2020a also demonstrated the advantage of using a hybrid of the rs and lr models for gpm in dak lak province vietnam hybrid ml ensemble techniques have been used to build the best groundwater prediction models and to handle complex multi dimensional data easily miraki et al 2019 the benchmark established models mlp cart and nbtree have produced good results the performances of these benchmark models have been described as favorable as our results also validate chen et al 2017a used mlp youssef et al 2016a used cart and moghaddam et al 2020b and arabameri et al 2020b used nbtree mosavi et al 2021 established random forest rf outperforms in comparison with the ensemble models of bagged classification and regression trees bagged cart adaptive boosting classification trees adaboost and boosted generalized additive model gamboost sajedi hosseini et al 2018 applied three machine learning models including boosted regression trees brt

et al 2019 estimating the uncertainty of models for modelling nitrate contamination of groundwater in part of iran using three state of the art machine learning models including support vector machine svm random forest rf and k nearest neighbor knn however there are very few differences between models in the precision of gwp modeling the results from the mlp rs model show better prediction capability for mapping gwp than the other models for the training dataset auc 0 981 acc 0 796 sst 0 796 spf 0 796 f score 0 796 and kappa 0 722 and for the validating dataset auc 0 976 acc 0 752 sst 0

type of input dataset in this analysis since dems give more precise results we used the alos palsar dem which has a high spatial resolution 12 5 m to extract the topographic factors the 14 geo environmental factors were considered groundwater determinant factors after the multi collinearity test giving vif and tol values determining significant variables for groundwater storage is a very complex problem in this study the rf model was used to evaluate significant variables slope elevation tri hand dtf dd curvature and rainfall were the dominant factors similar studies have reported that topographic factors soil cover geological features e g lithology fd and dtf and hydrological factors affect rates of water infiltration and increase groundwater volume rainfall is one of the most significant elements in hydrology and has been recognized as a major source of aquifer recharge razandi et al 2015 rainfall land use and lithology are the most critical factors in this research this is reasonable since runoff influences the recharge and reinforcement of water sources the tabriz river basin has high dome and cone shaped hills medium relative slopes and shorter slope lengths as the rainfall from the upper regions accumulates in the lower regions the tri indicates the difference in altitude between two neighboring areas in open terrain adiat et al 2012 found that precipitation has a large influence on percolation and gpm ozdemir 2011 suggested that topographic factors like elevation and slope have inverse relationships with gwp and that twi and dd have direct relationships which is supported by our correlation values between the gwcfs and springs evaluating the importance of effective factors in modeling can be valuable to managers enabling more robust decision making in this study we found slope elevation tri hand dtf rainfall lithology lulc and dd to be the most important predictors of the spatial distribution of gwp lithology and lulc can influence the permeability of soils and rock formations and influence gwp singh et al 2010 chen et al 2020a also identified the importance of geology and lulc therefore all characteristics topography environment hydrology and geology have an important influence on gwp guru et al 2017 reported that water table depth lineament density slope and dd had a greater effect on gwp and geology and land use seemed less important pourghasemi et al 2018 and kamali maskooni et al 2020 showed that lulc is not an important factor for gwp in semi arid regions the concentration of springs in geological formations like ash deposits and associated volcanic rocks the low level piedmont fan and the valley terrace deposits confirm high potential for groundwater in the southwestern region of the tabriz river basin it is also important to note the high importance of topographic factors such as elevation slope and tri in predicting gwp patterns validation of the gwp models demonstrated their outstanding performance and the ensemble models mlp rs cart rs and nbtree rs were more capable than the individual models such hybrid ensemble models have been shown to produce more accurate results than other individual models when developed for gpms in other study areas al fugara et al 2020 arabameri et al 2020e nguyen et al 2020b the correct methods are capable of producing gpms and can be used by decision makers for planning purposes the applied ml ensemble and hybrid models have excellent precision and can be used in the tabriz river basin region for groundwater management 5 conclusions this study evaluated the performance of the mlp rs cart rs and nbtree rs ensemble ml models in mapping gwp the results showed that the models were very accurate surpassing the three standalone models that were used as benchmarks mlp cart and nbtree the relative importance of gwcfs was assessed using three techniques rf lr and rab all six ml models in this study achieved good accuracy auc 0 85 however there were differences in their performances when using different validation methods mlp rs had the best accuracy training validation auc 0 981 0 976 acc 0 796 0 788 sst 0 796 0 788 spf 0 796 0 788 f score 0 796 0 788 and k 0 722 0 705 followed by cart rs then the nbtree rs ensemble model slope elevation tri hand dtf rainfall lithology lulc and dd were the most important gwcfs these characteristics may be used by managers and other decision makers to determine the possible distribution of groundwater without the need for more involved modeling efforts this knowledge can aid the understanding of current conditions in various regions of the tabriz basin and can be used to plan and monitor groundwater extraction future research efforts should assess other conditioning factors for model performance in terms of time and cost of acquisition and whether they can be used to predict groundwater distribution more easily the implementation of other environmental topographic hydrological and lithological factors into the development of gpms may also improve the reliability of the model results using hybrid ensemble models the drawbacks and problems resulting from using less robust stand alone models

domestic and irrigation water supplies for the world over of late the surface water subject to climatic changes bonada and resh 2013 sayers et al 2015 yang et al 2017 are modifying the hydrological budget hydrological processes aich et al 2014 jin et al 2018 aquatic ecosystems and biogeochemical cycles anderson et al 2017 the rapid increase of water diversion from water bodies for domestic industrial and agricultural purposes in recent decades has significantly changed the flow and water level regimes of many rivers lakes and wetlands this might have a great impact on the water cycle of ecosystems dependent on the water bodies songhaoshang 2013 lakes are among the most fragile environments due to anthropogenic effects alongside the natural observable factors that can trigger rapid environmental and climate changes to their ecosystems carpenter et al 2011 williamson et al 2009 soil erosion inflow from the surrounding terrestrial catchment high levels of sediment deposition dunbar et al 1999 urs corporation et al 2013 and the un wind airsheds are the major causes of diminishing lake size and water quality ≈Çawniczak et al 2011 lake characteristics such as size water clarity aquatic plant growth the colour of water or fishing potential are some of the important characteristics that have been changed the lake characteristics can be determined by in situ measurement modelling and remote sensing options the important morphological variables of the lake are surface area volume depth maximum and minimum shape and shoreline length or development mahala 2020 lake morphology can be quantified and measured by morphometric metrics which are descriptors of the shape and size of lake basins basos et al 2014 morphometric studies of the lake delineate the sensitivity of the catchment area dunbar et al 2002 hollister et al 2011 using arcgis mapping based on the surface area depth and volume changes of the lake morphometric data are very useful for finding

2006 bathymetry is the study of land surfaces inside the water bodies which exhibits the shape and depth of the lake dunbar et al 2002 de anda et al 2012 lake hawassa was selected for this study because of its high vulnerability to pollution as 90 of the industries directly or indirectly discharge partially treated or untreated wastewater mehari et al 2015 besides a progressive decrease of depth and volume of water coupled with an increase of surface area abebe et al 2018 of the lake is due to the recent regional droughts and domestic wastewater discharge through anthropogenic activities in the neighbourhood the shrinkage or drying up of a large lake can cause serious ecological and environmental disasters liu et al 2011 secchi depth measuring the transparency of the lake water level is an ideal indicator of the eutrophication status of the lake therefore it is imperative to assess lake morphology for the protection of the lake ecosystem and environment xu et al 2004 the sustainable economic and biophysical development of the river basin will in turn go a long way in ensuring overall stability to the ecosystem the study was aimed to determine the changes in secchi disc depth the actual depth and surface area of lake hawassa over a period of 46 years 1973 2019 concurrent with rainfall and temperature changes in addition a hydrographic survey of lake hawassa was conducted as part of this study to identify the reason for surface area increment as depicted by morphological characteristics in bathymetric maps the study of lake morphology and familiarity with the topic is important to lake management professionals in making the right decisions for the protection of the lake 2 materials methods 2 1 description of lake lake hawassa is one of the eight major ethiopian rift valley lakes covering an area of about 94 km2 however it is the smallest in comparison with other central rift valley natural lakes gebremedhin and berhanu 2015 it is situated 275 km south of the capital city addis ababa and west of hawassa town the study area lies between 6 49 7 15 n latitudes and 38 17 38 44 e longitudes fig 1 with an elevation range of 1685 masl at hawassa town and 2940 masl at kululu ridge southeast of the catchment and is encircled by various mountains such as mt tabor 1810 masl and mt alamura 2019 masl gebremariam 2002 the lake is surrounded by flat to slightly sloping lands towards the lake multidirectional faulting systems caldera collapse recent ground cracks and other possible hidden structures are some of the manifestations of the complexities nevertheless to understand the land use and climatic changes influence of the rising lake level simplified hydrologic relations of surface and sub surface of the catchment have been assumed lake hawassa doesn t have outflow so its morphology could be influenced by the inflow rainfall temperature and evaporation 2 1 1 contour and surface flow pattern map preparation a path tool was used to collect the number of points in lake catchment from google earth export those points into online elevation visualize to get longitudes latitudes and elevation data of each point this data saved in

xia et al 2019 lake hawassa s surface area was delineated using the modified normalized difference water index mndwi xu 2006 analyzing the images of 1973 1985 1994 2002 2015 and 2019 on the arc map these images were collected from the water works design and supervision enterprise wwdse depth measurements were taken from the lake by using a sonar echo sounder from starting point at the boat hiring station to the other end of the lake in a straight line shallow depth areas and other points in december 2019 fig 1 vertical datum depth measurements were also taken randomly along with the wastewater entry points the water level elevation was determined from fikir haik as a standard benchmark secchi depth was measured across the lake by using a secchi disc in december 2019 the most commonly employed measuring device to characterize the optical transparency of lake waters based on the sensitivity to the human eye tilzer 1987 water level data were collected from 1981 to 2019 from the national meteorological agency ethiopia 2 3 arc gis remote sensing landsat look viewer 2 3 1 topo map preparation the landsat images of the satellite were collected to prepare a shapefile in the

the united states geological survey usgs earth explorer website usgs earth explorer website 2014 six surface area maps for 1973 1985 1991 2002 2015 and 2019 were utilized to detect morphometric changes in the lake fig 6 the bathymetric maps of depth and secchi depth were digitized in arc gis 10 7 based on the present depth data 3 results discussion 3 1 watershed morphology the rift valley watershed had intensive tectonic activities and more dynamic geological processes lake hawassa s catchment is more complex in nature and behaviour the surface water flow pattern indicated in the topographic contour map fig 2 which was prepared by kriging interpolation using the elevation system of the catchment the minimum elevation of the surrounding area of the lake in the map was 1 286 1 550 masl and the maximum was 2 343 2 607 masl indicating the inflow of the tikurwuha river and its tributaries in the rainy season resulting in increased surface area tikurwuha river and tributaries are the major inflows that can be observed on the map fig 1 during the rainy seasons rainwater and sediment drain into the lake due to higher elevations of surrounding mountains the inflow of sediment might be the reason to decrease the depth as well as increase surface area of the lake urs corporation et al 2013 3 2 meteorological data meteorological parameters i e relative humidity sunny days light hours wind speed precipitation temperature and water level influence and explain the lake morphological conditions and their status lack of data availability only ten years of sunny days light hours and wind velocity data was collected from the national meteorological agency and ministry of water irrigation and energy ethiopia meteorological data of relative humidity precipitation temperature and water level were collected for 39 years from 1981 to 2019 to understand the conditions at lake hawassa relative humidity sunny days hours and wind velocity that influences the water level and the volume of the lake helfer et al 2012 andrew and sauquet 2017 post et al 2009 3 2 1 relative humidity the relative humidity percentage data were collected from the national meteorological agency during the period of 39 years 1981 2019 at lake hawassa the humidity percentage has recorded a minimum of 57 99 in the year 2000 and a maximum of 74 22 in the year 1998 fig 3 the higher percentages of relative humidity slow down the evaporation rate in the lake condi and webster 1997 at 100 of relative humidity the evaporation will be close to zero levels barry et al 2014 relative humidity was recorded more than 70 percentage in the years of 1982 1983 1987 1989 1990 1996 1997 1998 2006 2010 2013 2014 the drought conditions were observed during these 12 years edossa et al 2010 higher than in the remaining years this might be due to higher temperatures and the el nino effect in the year 1998 the relative humidity results indicate that the evaporation rate will be less the inflow of rainwater sediment domestic wastewater might be higher than the evaporation rate 3 2 2 sunny days light hours the day length in november was essentially constant for hawassa fig a1 the longest day was on 1st november i e 11 h 52 min and the shortest day was on 30th november with 11 h 45 min of daylight fig a1 the visible hours of the sun are called blackline from bottom most yellow to top most grey the colour bands indicate full daylight twilight civil nautical and astronomical and full night at 6 13 am on november 1 st recorded the earliest sunrise and the latest sunrise was 9 min later at 6 22 am on november 30 daylight saving time was not observed in hawassa during 2020 for reference on june 20 the longest day of the year the sun rose at 6 11 am and set 12 h 32 min later at 6 43 pm while on december 21 the shortest day of the year the sunrise was at 6 32 am and setting by 11 h 43 min later at 6 15 pm fig a1 indicated that the daytime was around 11 12 hours during the dry season the evaporation rate will be increased kumiko et al 2008 which might be due to higher temperatures and higher duration of radiation hours 3 2 3 wind speed fig a2 explained that the average wind speed was two folds during a decade from 2010 to 2020 at lake hawassa evaporation of water was influenced by the relative humidity which will force wind speed over the surface of the lake davarzani et al 2014 andrew and sauquet 2017 the process of vapour removal depends upon the wind and air turbulence which transfers large quantities of air over the surface of the lake the air on evaporation turns out to be gradually saturated with water vapour the water vapour removal and the evaporation rate increased on more replacement with drier air allen et al 1998 as per the data relative humidity was a maximum of 74 22 which indicates the wind speed influence on evaporation will be present at the lake davarzani et al 2014 3 2 4 precipitation temperature rainfall is one of the most influencing parameters of natural resources like water high precipitation causes a reduction in the temperature and increase in surface water level as well as groundwater table andrew and sauquet 2017 van engelenburg et al 2018 the highest rainfall was recorded in september and the lowest in december fig a3 at lake hawassa rainfall data collected over a period of 39 years 1981 2020 fig 4 the mean annual temperature and mean annual rainfall during the years 1981 1990 were 18 92 c to 18 69 c and 81 03 mm 81 07 mm respectively the mean annual temperature and rainfall during the years 1991 2000 were 19 51 c 20 32 c and 81 06 mm to 81 00 mm respectively the mean annual temperature and rainfall during the years 2001 2010 were 20 38 c to 18 96 c and 81 04 mm 81 06 mm respectively the mean annual temperature and rainfall during the years 2011 2019 were 19 89 c 20 19 c and 81 00 mm 81 09 mm respectively the mean annual temperature increased drastically from 18 83 c to 20 32 cduring the years 1999 2000 fig 4 the mean annual rainfall during these 39 years was slightly increased from 81 03 81 09 which might be influenced the water quantity of the lake the mean annual temperature during these 39 years was increased drastically from 18 92 c to 20 32 c the above data showed that the mean annual rainfall was nearly constant and temperature subsequently increased year wise from 1981 to 2019 fig 4 the increased mean annual temperatures will be caused to increase the evaporation rate in the lake in this regards the lake surface area should not be increased because rainfall is nearly constant every year however the surface area of the lake was increased this might be due to the inflow of rainfall water domestic wastewater and sediment accumulation at the bottom of the lake through erosion processes high temperatures create pressure on water bodies and aquatic life due to evaporation decreased dissolved oxygen content and increased concentration of pollutants the high hypolimnetic temperatures affected the biogeochemical processes in the lake woolway et al 2019 the impacts of increased surface temperatures for instance 0 32 c decade 1 have been more extensively studied globally o reilly et al 2015 the mean daily temperature was higher during the dry season 25 28 c and low 21 c during the rainy season in july with a rainfall of 125 mm as per the observation for the last 10 years the rain was during the nighttime which lowered the night temperature between 12 c 16 c fig a3 high temperatures influence the dissolved oxygen content north et al 2014 nutrients and phosphorus concentrations in the lake yankova et al 2017 the surface area and volume of the lake were influenced by the temperature high temperature causing a higher rate of evaporation may reduce the lake volume and increase the concentration of pollutants in the lake understanding predicting and quantifying the thermal response of lakes to abrupt and irregular climate change is critical for formulating future water resource management policies 3 2 5 water level the water level data for lake hawassa was collected for the last 39 years fig 5 the lake water level during the decades of 1981 1990 and 1991 2000 were increased from 1 453 m to 2 099 m and 1 573 m 2 468 m respectively the lake water level during the years 2001 2010 and 2011 2019 was decreased from 2 397 m to 2 392 m and 2 731 m to 1 999 m respectively this data indicated that the highest lake water level of 3 068 m and 3 0005 m was recorded in 1998 and 1999 respectively belete et al 2017 this might be due to high rainfall and low evaporation normally but as per the rainfall and temperature data it may not the reason the lake water level was significantly increased during the years 1996 1997 1997 1998 2006 2007 and 2013 2014 the lake water level radically decreased from 2004 to 2006 and again increased up to 2 731 m in the year 2011 the reduction in water level was again noticed since 2011 2013 up to 1 839 m the increase in the water level of the lake in 1998 2011 2017 might be due to an increase in the inflow of rainwater along with sediment and domestic wastewater into the lake the rainfall in 1998 2011 2017 was comparatively lesser than in the years 1997 2010 2016 fig 5 even though the water level was increased this indicated that rainfall was not only the reason for the increment of lake surface area but the surface flow and groundwater inflow were equally important the previous year s high rainfall caused more inflow of sediment to the lake and subsequently increases the water level in the next year the water level of the lake will be increased by the increase of rainfall the water level of the lake was decreased during the years 1991 1995 2004 2006 and 2017eventhough the rainfall was high fig 5 this might be the reason to increase the surface area of the lake by the sedimentation 3 3 morphological data 3 3 1 surface area the data of the lake surface area were collected over the period of 46 years 1973 2019 from land sat look viewer and prepared topo maps to identify the long term changes in the lake surface area the surface area of the lake as interpreted from a shapefile was about 83 98 km2 in 1973 and 91 87 km2 in 2002 fig a4 showing an expansion of about 7 89 km2 during 29 years likewise the surface area of the lake was 90 65 km2 in 2009 gradually increased to 93 45 km2 in 2019 showing a spread out of 2 8 km2 in 9 years fig 6 as per the results the surface area of the lake increased by 11 28 over 46 years however it was indicated worldwide that 37 1 of lakes maintained the same surface area 37 6 registered decrease and only 25 3 showed an increase in surface area law et al 2018 as per the data for lake hawassa there was a gradual increase in surface area from 1973 to 2002 decreased thereafter up to 2015 fig a5 and a drastic increase up to 2019 fig a6 a7 the reason for the increase in the surface area might be due to more rainfall sediment inflow into the lake perennial rivers are connected only on the eastern side of the catchment emerging from the highlands and end up in the cheleleka swamps from which the tirkurwuha river carried the water to lake hawassa the surface area of lake cheleleka was about 12km2 in 1972 but it has completely disappeared now as a result of siltation water works design and supervision enterprise wwdse 2001 lake cheleleka served as a sediment trap for the tikurwuha river which flows into lake hawassa presently tikurwuha river discharge along with the sediment into lake hawassa has increased to change directly the surface area of the lake the sediment inflow causes a reduction in the depth table 1 and the inflow due to rainfall and domestic activities were increasing so that this might be the reason to increase the surface area of the lake the trend of surface area and shoreline change was presented in geo referenced special digitized cartography maps and different years surface area over lay of cartography map fig 6 respectively 3 3 2 lake water depth the depth measurements of lake hawassa were taken from starting point at the boat hiring station to the other end of the lake in a straight line the maximum depth of 25 8 m was identified in the center of the lake 3 km from the boat station at 7 0600 latitudes and 38 4456 longitudes table 2 depth measurements of the lake were made randomly along with the inlet points the measured depths are presented in table 2 the lowest and highest depths were 0 3 m and 25 8 m respectively depth of lake hawassa at various points was displayed in fig 7 by using the bathymetric map bathymetric map fig 7 showed that the maximum depth of the lake was 26 77 m as per kriging interpolation calculation the depth of the lake affects the physical chemical and biological properties of the lake sobek et al 2011 as well as a direct effect of lake pollutant dispersion and transportation as a result of increased rotation time of pollutant the sustainability of aquatic life will be high when depth is more the depth of the lake decreased from 13 57 m to 9 08 m in a span of 20 years 1999 2019 in all over a period of 46 years the depth of the lake decreased by 27 48 table 1 there is a continuous discharge of wastewater from non point sources including agricultural areas to the boat hiring site fig a8 the restaurants also dispose of the kitchen waste directly into the lake indeed kitchen waste degrades the water quality by introducing nutrients that promote the growth of aquatic plants the inflow of sediment along with nutrients causes eutrophication of the lake the water level of lake hawassa is increasing and the depth of water decreases due to sedimentation and eutrophication 3 3 3 secchi depth the clarity of water depends on the concentration of total solids and the colour of the water body the colour of the water sample is more intense in a eutrophic lake the secchi depth was 2 06 m where the depth of the lake was 25 8 m fig 8 the secchi depth was deeper at peripheral zones and low in central zones table a1 that meant the eutrophication of the lake was higher in the central than peripheral zones as per lisa smith et al 2006 the secchi depth of 1 1 2 2 4 and 4 represents the hypertrophic mesotrophic eutrophic and oligotrophic states of the lake respectively the lake hawassa was in eutrophic and hypertrophic states at central and peripheral zones respectively 4 conclusion the study concluded that the mean annual relative humidity was a maximum of 70 in 12 years out of 39 years and the average mean annual relative humidity was recorded as 67 18 the mean annual rainfall was a minimum of 80 97 mm and a maximum of 81 09 mm which is nearly constant in the study area the mean annual temperature was a minimum of 18 38 c and a maximum of 21 13 c which was increased 2 75 c over a period of 24 years later it was decreased slowly to 20 19 c in the year 2019 the mean annual water level was a minimum of 1 453 m and a maximum of 3 068 m the water level was fluctuating in lake hawassa the water level of the lake showed an increase in 1998 2002 2003 2009 2011 and 2015 2019 even though the rainfall was comparatively constant this might be due to rainwater in addition to the domestic wastewater and groundwater inflow these results concluding that the rainfall was nearly constant and the temperature was increased drastically as well as the average mean annual relative humidity was above 67 these indicate the evaporation rate might be caused to decrease in the volume and surface area of the lake the shoreline was increased from 46 75 km to 55 68 km over a period of 46 years mean depth was decreased from 12 52 m to 9 08 m these results concluded that the depth was decreased due to the inflow of sediment and surface area was increased due to the inflow of rainfall water and domestic wastewater the sediment inflow increased the surface area by about 11 28 and decreased the depth and volume by about 27 48 and 12 09 respectively over 46 years secchi depth was limited to 2 06 m in the central zone of the lake possibly due to eutrophication as the lake is in a eutrophic state it was imperative to control the inflow of sediment causing eutrophication in the lake author statement daniel reddythota conceptualization plan of research work methodology data curation writing original

2006 bathymetry is the study of land surfaces inside the water bodies which exhibits the shape and depth of the lake dunbar et al 2002 de anda et al 2012 lake hawassa was selected for this study because of its high vulnerability to pollution as 90 of the industries directly or indirectly discharge partially treated or untreated wastewater mehari et al 2015 besides a progressive decrease of depth and volume of water coupled with an increase of surface area abebe et al 2018 of the lake is due to the recent regional droughts and domestic wastewater discharge through anthropogenic activities in the neighbourhood the shrinkage or drying up of a large lake can cause serious ecological and environmental disasters liu et al 2011 secchi depth measuring the transparency of the lake water level is an ideal indicator of the eutrophication status of the lake therefore it is imperative to assess lake morphology for the protection of the lake ecosystem and environment xu et al 2004 the sustainable economic and biophysical development of the river basin will in turn go a long way in ensuring overall stability to the ecosystem the study was aimed to determine the changes in secchi disc depth the actual depth and surface area of lake hawassa over a period of 46 years 1973 2019 concurrent with rainfall and temperature changes in addition a hydrographic survey of lake hawassa was conducted as part of this study to identify the reason for surface area increment as depicted by morphological characteristics in bathymetric maps the study of lake morphology and familiarity with the topic is important to lake management professionals in making the right decisions for the protection of the lake 2 materials methods 2 1 description of lake lake hawassa is one of the eight major ethiopian rift valley lakes covering an area of about 94 km2 however it is the smallest in comparison with other central rift valley natural lakes gebremedhin and berhanu 2015 it is situated 275 km south of the capital city addis ababa and west of hawassa town the study area lies between 6 49 7 15 n latitudes and 38 17 38 44 e longitudes fig 1 with an elevation range of 1685 masl at hawassa town and 2940 masl at kululu ridge southeast of the catchment and is encircled by various mountains such as mt tabor 1810 masl and mt alamura 2019 masl gebremariam 2002 the lake is surrounded by flat to slightly sloping lands towards the lake multidirectional faulting systems caldera collapse recent ground cracks and other possible hidden structures are some of the manifestations of the complexities nevertheless to understand the land use and climatic changes influence of the rising lake level simplified hydrologic relations of surface and sub surface of the catchment have been assumed lake hawassa doesn t have outflow so its morphology could be influenced by the inflow rainfall temperature and evaporation 2 1 1 contour and surface flow pattern map preparation a path tool was used to collect the number of points in lake catchment from google earth export those points into online elevation visualize to get longitudes latitudes and elevation data of each point this data saved in

surface area depth secchi depth water level the lake surface area was detected by optical remote sensing an important method of monitoring the extent of the lake surface dellepiane et al 2004 haoming xia et al 2019 lake hawassa s surface area was delineated using the modified normalized difference water index mndwi xu 2006 analyzing the images of 1973 1985 1994 2002 2015 and 2019 on the arc map these images were collected from the water works design and supervision enterprise wwdse depth measurements were taken from the lake by using a sonar echo sounder from starting point at the boat hiring station to the other end of the lake in a straight line shallow depth areas and other points in december 2019 fig 1 vertical datum depth measurements were also taken randomly along with the wastewater entry points the water level elevation was determined from fikir haik as a standard benchmark secchi depth was measured across the lake by using a secchi disc in december 2019 the most commonly employed measuring device to characterize the optical transparency of lake waters based on the sensitivity to the human eye tilzer 1987 water level data were collected from 1981 to 2019 from the national meteorological agency ethiopia 2 3 arc gis remote sensing landsat look viewer 2 3 1 topo map preparation the landsat images of the satellite were collected to prepare a shapefile in the arc map in the form of a geo database over a period of 1973 to 2019 2 3 2 kriging interpolation the kriging interpolation was made based on the depth and secchi depth of the lake to see the geospatial

2018 and used to prepare a depth bathymetric map maina et al 2019 sang et al 2017 the satellite images of landsat 1 to landsat 4were collected to prepare cartographic maps of the lake surface area the lake level observation data from the federal ministry of water irrigation and electricity and hand drawn bathymetric map of the lake from wwdse and southern national nationalities peoples region snnpr water bureau water works design and supervision enterprise wwdse 2001 cloud free land sat thematic mapper images path 168 row 55 acquired on 31 january 1973 up to 16 november 2019 were downloaded from the united states geological survey usgs earth explorer website usgs earth explorer website 2014 six surface area maps for 1973 1985 1991 2002 2015 and 2019 were utilized to detect morphometric changes in the lake fig 6 the bathymetric maps of depth and secchi depth were digitized in arc gis 10 7 based on the present depth data 3 results discussion 3 1 watershed morphology the rift valley watershed had intensive tectonic activities and more dynamic geological processes lake hawassa s catchment is more complex in nature and behaviour the surface water flow pattern indicated in the topographic contour map fig 2 which was prepared by kriging interpolation using the elevation system of the catchment the minimum elevation of the surrounding area of the lake in the map was 1 286 1 550 masl and the maximum was 2 343 2 607 masl indicating the inflow of the tikurwuha river and its tributaries in the rainy season resulting in increased surface area tikurwuha river and tributaries are the major inflows that can be observed on the map fig 1 during the rainy seasons rainwater and sediment drain into the lake due to higher elevations of surrounding mountains the inflow of sediment might be the reason to decrease the depth as well as increase surface area of the lake urs corporation et al 2013 3 2 meteorological data meteorological parameters i e relative humidity sunny days light hours wind speed precipitation temperature and water level influence and explain the lake morphological conditions and their status lack of data availability only ten years of sunny days light hours and wind velocity data was collected from the national meteorological agency and ministry of water irrigation and energy ethiopia meteorological data of relative humidity precipitation temperature and water level were collected for 39 years from 1981 to 2019 to understand the conditions at lake hawassa relative humidity sunny days hours and wind velocity that influences the water level and the volume of the lake helfer et al 2012 andrew and sauquet 2017 post et al 2009 3 2 1 relative humidity the relative humidity percentage data were collected from the national meteorological agency during the period of 39 years 1981 2019 at lake hawassa the humidity percentage has recorded a minimum of 57 99 in the year 2000 and a maximum of 74 22 in the year 1998 fig 3 the higher percentages of relative humidity slow down the evaporation rate in the lake condi and webster 1997 at 100 of relative humidity the evaporation will be close to zero levels barry et al 2014 relative humidity was recorded more than 70 percentage in the years of 1982 1983 1987 1989 1990 1996 1997 1998 2006 2010 2013 2014 the drought conditions were observed during these 12 years edossa et al 2010 higher than in the remaining years this might be due to higher temperatures and the el nino effect in the year 1998 the relative humidity results indicate that the evaporation rate will be less the inflow of rainwater sediment domestic wastewater might be higher than the evaporation rate 3 2 2 sunny days light hours the day length in november was essentially constant for hawassa fig a1 the longest day was on 1st november i e 11 h 52 min and the shortest day was on 30th november with 11 h 45 min of daylight fig a1 the visible hours of the sun are called blackline from bottom most yellow to top most grey the colour bands indicate full daylight twilight civil nautical and astronomical and full night at 6 13 am on november 1 st recorded the earliest sunrise and the latest sunrise was 9 min later at 6 22 am on november 30 daylight saving time was not observed in hawassa during 2020 for reference on june 20 the longest day of the year the sun rose at 6 11 am and set 12 h 32 min later at 6 43 pm while on december 21 the shortest day of the year the sunrise was at 6 32 am and setting by 11 h 43 min later at 6 15 pm fig a1 indicated that the daytime was around 11 12 hours during the dry season the evaporation rate will be increased kumiko et al 2008 which might be due to higher temperatures and higher duration of radiation hours 3 2 3 wind speed fig a2 explained that the average wind speed was two folds during a decade from 2010 to 2020 at lake hawassa evaporation of water was influenced by the relative humidity which will force wind speed over the surface of the lake davarzani et al 2014 andrew and sauquet 2017 the process of vapour removal depends upon the wind and air turbulence which transfers large quantities of air over the surface of the lake the air on evaporation turns out to be gradually saturated with water vapour the water vapour removal and the evaporation rate increased on more replacement with drier air allen et al 1998 as per the data relative humidity was a maximum of 74 22 which indicates the wind speed influence on evaporation will be present at the lake davarzani et al 2014 3 2 4 precipitation temperature rainfall is one of the most influencing parameters of natural resources like water high precipitation causes a reduction in the temperature and increase in surface water level as well as groundwater table andrew and sauquet 2017 van engelenburg et al 2018 the highest rainfall was recorded in september and the lowest in december fig a3 at lake hawassa rainfall data collected over a period of 39 years 1981 2020 fig 4 the mean annual temperature and mean annual rainfall during the years 1981 1990 were 18 92 c to 18 69 c and 81 03 mm 81 07 mm respectively the mean annual temperature and rainfall during the years 1991 2000 were 19 51 c 20 32 c and 81 06 mm to 81 00 mm respectively the mean annual temperature and rainfall during the years 2001 2010 were 20 38 c to 18 96 c and 81 04 mm 81 06 mm respectively the mean annual temperature and rainfall during the years 2011 2019 were 19 89 c 20 19 c and 81 00 mm 81 09 mm respectively the mean annual temperature increased drastically from 18 83 c to 20 32 cduring the years 1999 2000 fig 4 the mean annual rainfall during these 39 years was slightly increased from 81 03 81 09 which might be influenced the water quantity of the lake the mean annual temperature during these 39 years was increased drastically from 18 92 c to 20 32 c the above data showed that the mean annual rainfall was nearly constant and temperature subsequently increased year wise from 1981 to 2019 fig 4 the increased mean annual temperatures will be caused to increase the evaporation rate in the lake in this regards the lake surface area should not be increased because rainfall is nearly constant every year however the surface area of the lake was increased this might be due to the inflow of rainfall water domestic wastewater and sediment accumulation at the bottom of the lake through erosion processes high temperatures create pressure on water bodies and aquatic life due to evaporation decreased dissolved oxygen content and increased concentration of pollutants the high hypolimnetic temperatures affected the biogeochemical processes in the lake woolway et al 2019 the impacts of increased surface temperatures for instance 0 32 c decade 1 have been more extensively studied globally o reilly et al 2015 the mean daily temperature was higher during the dry season 25 28 c and low 21 c during the rainy season in july with a rainfall of 125 mm as per the observation for the last 10 years the rain was during the nighttime which lowered the night temperature between 12 c 16 c fig a3 high temperatures influence the dissolved oxygen content north et al 2014 nutrients and phosphorus concentrations in the lake yankova et al 2017 the surface area and volume of the lake were influenced by the temperature high temperature causing a higher rate of evaporation may reduce the lake volume and increase the concentration of pollutants in the lake understanding predicting and quantifying the thermal response of lakes to abrupt and irregular climate change is critical for formulating future water resource management policies 3 2 5 water level the water level data for lake hawassa was collected for the last 39 years fig 5 the lake water level during the decades of 1981 1990 and 1991 2000 were increased from 1 453 m to 2 099 m and 1 573 m 2 468 m respectively the lake water level during the years 2001 2010 and 2011 2019 was decreased from 2 397 m to 2 392 m and 2 731 m to 1 999 m respectively this data indicated that the highest lake water level of 3 068 m and 3 0005 m was recorded in 1998 and 1999 respectively belete et al 2017 this might be due to high rainfall and low evaporation normally but as per the rainfall and temperature data it may not the reason the lake water level was significantly increased during the years 1996 1997 1997 1998 2006 2007 and 2013 2014 the lake water level radically decreased from 2004 to 2006 and again increased up to 2 731 m in the year 2011 the reduction in water level was again noticed since 2011 2013 up to 1 839 m the increase in the water level of the lake in 1998 2011 2017 might be due to an increase in the inflow of rainwater along with sediment and domestic wastewater into the lake the rainfall in 1998 2011 2017 was comparatively lesser than in the years 1997 2010 2016 fig 5 even though the water level was increased this indicated that rainfall was not only the reason for the increment of lake surface area but the surface flow and groundwater inflow were equally important the previous year s high rainfall caused more inflow of sediment to the lake and subsequently increases the water level in the next year the water level of the lake will be increased by the increase of rainfall the water level of the lake was decreased during the years 1991 1995 2004 2006 and 2017eventhough the rainfall was high fig 5 this might be the reason to increase the surface area of the lake by the sedimentation 3 3 morphological data 3 3 1 surface area the data of the lake surface area were collected over the period of 46 years 1973 2019 from land sat look viewer and prepared topo maps to identify the long term changes in the lake surface area the surface area of the lake as interpreted from a shapefile was about 83 98 km2 in 1973 and 91 87 km2 in 2002 fig a4 showing an expansion of about 7 89 km2 during 29 years likewise the surface area of the lake was 90 65 km2 in 2009 gradually increased to 93 45 km2 in 2019 showing a spread out of 2 8 km2 in 9 years fig 6 as per the results the surface area of the lake increased by 11 28 over 46 years however it was indicated worldwide that 37 1 of lakes maintained the same surface area 37 6 registered decrease and only 25 3 showed an increase in surface area law et al 2018 as per the data for lake hawassa there was a gradual increase in surface area from 1973 to 2002 decreased thereafter up to 2015 fig a5 and a drastic increase up to 2019 fig a6 a7 the reason for the increase in the surface area might be due to more rainfall sediment inflow into the lake perennial rivers are connected only on the eastern side of the catchment emerging from the highlands and end up in the cheleleka swamps from which the tirkurwuha river carried the water to lake hawassa the surface area of lake cheleleka was about 12km2 in 1972 but it has completely disappeared now as a result of siltation water works design and supervision enterprise wwdse 2001 lake cheleleka served as a sediment trap for the tikurwuha river which flows into lake hawassa presently tikurwuha river discharge along with the sediment into lake hawassa has increased to change directly the surface area of the lake the sediment inflow causes a reduction in the depth table 1 and the inflow due to rainfall and domestic activities were increasing so that this might be the reason to increase the surface area of the lake the trend of surface area and shoreline change was presented in geo referenced special digitized cartography maps and different years surface area over lay of cartography map fig 6 respectively 3 3 2 lake water depth the depth measurements of lake hawassa were taken from starting point at the boat hiring station to the other end of the lake in a straight line the maximum depth of 25 8 m was identified in the center of the lake 3 km from the boat station at 7 0600 latitudes and 38 4456 longitudes table 2 depth measurements of the lake were made randomly along with the inlet points the measured depths are presented in table 2 the lowest and highest depths were 0 3 m and 25 8 m respectively depth of lake hawassa at various points was displayed in fig 7 by using the bathymetric map bathymetric map fig 7 showed that the maximum depth of the lake was 26 77 m as per kriging interpolation calculation the depth of the lake affects the physical chemical and biological properties of the lake sobek et al 2011 as well as a direct effect of lake pollutant dispersion and transportation as a result of increased rotation time of pollutant the sustainability of aquatic life will be high when depth is more the depth of the lake decreased from 13 57 m to 9 08 m in a span of 20 years 1999 2019 in all over a period of 46 years the depth of the lake decreased by 27 48 table 1 there is a continuous discharge of wastewater from non point sources including agricultural areas to the boat hiring site fig a8 the restaurants also dispose of the kitchen waste directly into the lake indeed kitchen waste degrades the water quality by introducing nutrients that promote the growth of aquatic plants the inflow of sediment along with nutrients causes eutrophication of the lake the water level of lake hawassa is increasing and the depth of water decreases due to sedimentation and eutrophication 3 3 3 secchi depth the clarity of water depends on the concentration of total solids and the colour of the water body the colour of the water sample is more intense in a eutrophic lake the secchi depth was 2 06 m where the depth of the lake was 25 8 m fig 8 the secchi depth was deeper at peripheral zones and low in central zones table a1 that meant the eutrophication of the lake was higher in the central than peripheral zones as per lisa smith et al 2006 the secchi depth of 1 1 2 2 4 and 4 represents the hypertrophic mesotrophic eutrophic and oligotrophic states of the lake respectively the lake hawassa was in eutrophic and hypertrophic states at central and peripheral zones respectively 4 conclusion the study concluded that the mean annual relative humidity was a maximum of 70 in 12 years out of 39 years and the average mean annual relative humidity was recorded as 67 18 the mean annual rainfall was a minimum of 80 97 mm and a maximum of 81 09 mm which is nearly constant in the study area the mean annual temperature was a minimum of 18 38 c and a maximum of 21 13 c which was increased 2 75 c over a period of 24 years later it was decreased slowly to 20 19 c in the year 2019 the mean annual water level was a minimum of 1 453 m and a maximum of 3 068 m the water level was fluctuating in lake hawassa the water level of the lake showed an increase in 1998 2002 2003 2009 2011 and 2015 2019 even though the rainfall was comparatively constant this might be due to rainwater in addition to the domestic wastewater and groundwater inflow these results concluding that the rainfall was nearly constant and the temperature was increased drastically as well as the average mean annual relative humidity was above 67 these indicate the evaporation rate might be caused to decrease in the volume and surface area of the lake the shoreline was increased from 46 75 km to 55 68 km over a period of 46 years mean depth was decreased from 12 52 m to 9 08 m these results concluded that the depth was decreased due to the inflow of sediment and surface area was increased due to the inflow of rainfall water and domestic wastewater the sediment inflow increased the surface area by about 11 28 and decreased the depth and volume by about 27 48 and 12 09 respectively over 46 years secchi depth was limited to 2 06 m in the central zone of the lake possibly due to eutrophication as the lake is in a eutrophic state it was imperative to control the inflow of sediment causing eutrophication in the lake author statement daniel reddythota conceptualization plan of research work methodology data curation writing original

8199,study region the nam ngum river basin the major tributary of the mekong river is located in the laos pdr study focus this study aims to assess the sensitivity of nam ngum 1 reservoir operation to water resource uncertainty driven by a combination of climate change and upstream cascade dam development new hydrological insights for the region precipitation projections of the basin under a 4 increase scenario vary in the range of 9 6 to 6 9 compared to the historical observed precipitation present climate the impact of climate change on hydropower resources was investigated based on the combined effect of climate change and upstream cascade dam development the projected inflow of the nam ngum 1 reservoir at the full development stage will change from 16 0 to 6 5 which results in a large range of annual energy production changes from 18 8 to 2 8 compared to the current condition present climate and existing dam stage furthermore water losses from the reservoir due to water discharge from the spillway for extreme floods and evaporation are expected to increase with increasing temperature which will lead to a loss in energy production our study indicates that the operation of hydropower should be adapted to the effects of climate change this information can be used by stakeholders to propose water resource management strategies keywords climate change hydropower uncertainty assessment distributed hydrologic model streamflow projection 1 introduction the mekong flows southward for approximately 4 800 km from its source tibetan plateau through china myanmar lao pdr thailand and cambodia before entering the south china sea via a complex delta system in viet nam with an approximately 795 000 km2 of the total basin area the mekong river ranks 10th among the world s great rivers based on mean annual flow mrc 2005 rapid regional growth and energy demands from neighboring countries have prompted the construction of numerous dams along the mainstream and tributaries of the mekong river kummu and varis 2007 the catchment area of mekong river in laos pdr is approximately 25 of the total basin and contributes 35 of the total flow into the river which is considered to be the country with the highest contribution in the mekong river basin mrb mrc 2005 the country has benefits in terms of topography and water resources which provide significant potential for hydropower development adb 2019 reported that the country s exploitable hydro potential is estimated to be 23 000 mw and 5 172 mw of hydropower capacity had been operated as of 2017 based on an analysis of projects to be completed by 2030 total hydropower build out for both domestic and export use will total 16 500 mw or around 70 of the estimated potential however large variations in changes in hydropower generation across regions and even within regions due to the effects of climate change have been reported hamududu and killingtveit 2012 the uncertainty of future hydropower generation is derived not only by the current river flow inter annual variation but also by the change in long term river flow availability due to the effect of climate change blackshear et al 2011 several previous studies have assessed the impact of climate change on hydropower generation on a global scale hamududu and killingtveit 2012 van vliet et al 2016 continental scale iea 2020

the mekong tributaries srepok sesan and sekong 3s basins during full development driven by a2 and b2 emission scenarios mpi echam4 compared to the baseline scenario however the significant uncertainty in hydropower production assessment is associated with the variability of precipitation projections hamlet et al 2010 resulting from the use of different general circulation models gcms the model projections are affected by a range of uncertainties including emissions scenario uncertainty internal variability of the climate system and model response uncertainty hawkins and sutton 2009 the quantification of all aspects of model uncertainty requires multi model ensembles ideally as a complement to the exploration of single model uncertainties through perturbed physics ensemble experiments tebaldi and knutti 2007 several studies have applied a large ensemble to improve the uncertainties of future river discharge projections ayers et al 2016 mohammed et al 2015 thompson et al 2017 carvajal et al 2017 used a large ensemble cmip5 to assess the sensitivity and improve the reliability of hydropower generation to uncertain water resource availability driven by future climate change in ecuador the database for policy decision making for future climate change d4pdf is a large gcm ensemble database with a high resolution model that permits the analysis of long term trends

2018 extreme floods and river discharge tanaka et al 2020 hanittinan et al 2020 information about the adaptability of hydropower generation to hydrologic changes and global warming effects in the region is scarce especially for large scale dams in the main tributaries of the mekong thus this study aims to assess the combined impacts of climate change and dam development in a tributary of the mekong river in laos pdr nam ngum river on hydropower generation using a large ensemble of climate projections for this purpose a physically based distributed hydrologic model meema and tachikawa 2020 was adopted with the projected climate variables using the delta method for different climate scenarios obtained from a large gcm ensemble database d4pdf the mean of the projected climate ensembles from each climate scenario was used to evaluate the change in water resources and power production at different dam development stages of the basin furthermore the results of the study demonstrate that implementation strategies for an adaptive reservoir operation are needed to mitigate the impact of climate change 2 description of study area 2 1 nam ngum river basin the nam ngum river basin nnrb is the main mekong tributary located in the central part of lao pdr the basin is one of the most significant areas in lao pdr in terms of size approximately 16 800 km2 and 7 of the country area annual flows contributing to the mainstream of the mekong river are approximately 14 which accounts for approximately 40 of the country s contribution to the mekong river flow the headwaters of the nam ngum river are at an elevation of 2 800 m in the northeast of the basin and heads southward for 420 km to its outlet at the mekong river downstream of the nam ngum 1 reservoir nn1 the nam ngum river has a gentle slope as it meanders along its course the vientiane plain extends from each bank covering an area of approximately 2 000 km2 at elevations of 160 180 m during the wet season the plains are influenced by flooding in the floodplain the average annual discharge of the nam ngum river to mekong is approximately 21 000 million cubic meters mcm the flows are highly seasonal with low flow occurring from march to april and high flow occurring from august to september the nam ngum basin is largely tropical with a distinct wet season from june to october and a dry season for the rest of the year the highest temperature is in march and april where average temperatures range from 30 c to 38 c depending on location and altitude the lowest temperatures occur between november and february with an average of 15 c at higher elevations the xiengkhuang plateau the mean annual rainfall of the basin is approximately 2 000 mm ranging from 1 450 mm to 3 500 mm across the basin the highest amount of rainfall occurred near the vangvieng area and gradually decreased northeastward to the xiengkhuang vicinity 2 2 water resources development currently six hydroelectricity related schemes are located in the nnrb with a total reservoir storage of approximately 15 200 mcm and a combined electricity generation capacity of 990 mw the first hydropower station in the basin was the nn1 reservoir which was developed in 1971 with an installed capacity of 155 mw the nn1 scheme the largest among the six hydropower schemes has a storage capacity of 7 010 mcm the nam song diversion project ns dv operated in 1996 diverts approximately 3650 mcm year of water from the nam song river into the nn1 reservoir the other two hydropower stations nam ngum 2 nn2 and nam lik 1 2 reservoirs began operation in 2011 with installed capacities of 615 mw and 100 mw respectively nn2 is the major power station located upstream of the nn1 reservoir with the largest power capacity and second largest storage volume of 6270 mcm among the dams in the basin in 2012 the nam ngum 5 nn5 hydropower station began operation with an installed capacity of 120 mw the dam is located on the tributary of the nam ngum river nam ting river in addition the nam leuk nl and the nam mang hydropower dams located outside of the nam ngum basin began operation in 2000 and 2005 respectively diverting water from the nl and nam mang basins into the nn1 reservoir and the vientiane plain respectively the nnbr has significant hydropower potential with high rainfall and large differences in elevation an additional four dams are at various stages of development ranging from planning to construction in the case where all dams are constructed the total power generation capacity is 1 900 mw and the total storage volume is 17 200 mcm which is approximately 80 of the total annual river discharge of the nam ngum river the locations of the hydropower stations are shown in fig 1 and a list of hydropower stations in the basin is summarized in table 1 3 coupled simulation model for hydrological reservoir and hydropower generation the 1 k dhm is a distributed hydrological model based on a kinematic wave flow approximation that considers surface subsurface flow the elevation and flow direction were determined using topographical data provided by hydrosheds lehner et al 2006 with digital elevation models dems in 30 s approximately 1 km resolution meema and tachikawa 2020 improved the 1 k dhm for long term river flow simulation to assess the impact of hydropower operation and it was extended by incorporating the reservoir hydropower plant process into the model in the nnrb meema et al 2020 the model was calibrated from 2002 to 2005 in which the hydrologic parameters and reservoir operation of the nn1 operation rules were optimized to perform the simulation in agreement with the actual operation record validation period 1 2006 2009 presents the condition without nn2 and validation period

model performances in table 2 the calibrated hydrologic parameters and reservoir operation data rule curve and operation rules were collected the coupled 1 k dhm consists of two main processes hydrological processes and reservoir hydropower plant processes as shown in the schematic drawing in fig 3 a general description of each process is discussed in the following subsections 3 1 hydrologic processes each grid of the hydrological process consists of river and slope flow components tanaka and tachikawa 2015 to improve long term river flow simulation meema and tachikawa 2020 improved the structure of the slope flow component by incorporating an unconfined bedrock aquifer layer into the model a combination of discharge from both layers contributes to the river channel component as the lateral discharge per unit length the modification of the slope flow model consists of a surface soil layer original model and a bedrock aquifer layer the continuity and momentum

of reservoir routing and hydropower generation in which the release discharge to the downstream grid is determined using the reservoir guide curve rule curve method release flows are specified for each time step as well as the reservoir level and spillage the generated discharge discharge through the turbines is determined by using the release decision model based on the multiple zones of the reservoir and their operating rules as shown in fig 4 as an example input to the model for the nn1 reservoir fig 4 includes three curves the full supply level guide curve can have more than one curve for any reservoir and minimum operation level the guide curve has two purposes to guide the reservoir water level which the model tries as much as possible to follow and to separate the zones the zones that are separated are referred to as the multiple zones of the reservoir the numbers below the figure each value for each month in each zone are the generation time per day in hour we call this as operation rules of the zone in this study we collected this value from the actual operation record during the calibration period 2002 2005 as the input of the model this process provides the target of energy generation that evaluates the release to obtain the reservoir water level to the guide curve rule curve at the end of the time step as much as possible based on the starting reservoir water

assigned the amount of water diversion as the boundary condition in the model the diversion records from 2002 to 2009 for the nam song diversion dam ns dv and the nl dam were used to determine the diversion amount from the dams in the present climate scenario to predict the amount of water diversion in different climate scenarios we assumed that the operation of the diversion dams was based on the amount of inflow therefore we adopted the monthly ratio between the simulated flow in the present climate condition and the discharge of the diversion record then we applied the ratio with the simulated river discharge for each climate scenario the diverted water discharge was limited to the maximum diversion capacity 200 m3 s for ns dv and 60 m3 s for nl the amount of water diversion can be calculated as follows 7 q d v s i m i j k i j q i n s i m i j where j is month i is the year 2002 2003 2009 q i n s i m is simulated inflow to the diversion dam q d v s i m is simulated diversion

base d4pdf a d4pdf contains the outputs from global warming simulations under the present 4 4 k and 2 2 k temperature increase conditions using a 60 km atmospheric general circulation model agcm the duration of each experiment was 60 years each set of experiments had 100 and 90 ensemble members for the historical and 4 increase experiments in which the initial conditions and the lower boundary conditions were perturbed mizuta et al 2017 the experimental settings are listed in table 3 the historical climate was simulated using a 100 member ensemble the observed monthly mean sea surface temperature sst sea ice concentration sic hirahara et al 2014 and climatological monthly sea ice thickness sit bourke and garrett 1987 were used as the lower boundary conditions of the agcm for the 4 k simulation the global mean surface air temperature was considered 4 c warmer than in the pre industrial era the greenhouse gases ghgs were set to the values in 2090 of the rcp8 5 the climatological sst warming patterns Œ¥ssts from six cmip5 models ccsm4 cc gfdl cm3 gf hadgem2 ao ha miroc5 mi mpi esm mr mp and mri cgcm3 mr were added to the observational sst after removing the long term trend component the 6 Œ¥ssts contained a 15 member ensemble yielding a total of 90 members for the 2 k simulation the global mean surface air temperature was considered to be 2 c warmer than in the pre industrial era and the ghgs were set to the values in 2040 of the rcp8 5 scenario fujita et al 2019 the same six cmip5 models as in the 4 k simulation were used as the Œ¥ssts of the agcm each of the six Œ¥ssts contained a 9 member ensemble yielding a total of 54 members 4 2 climate projection scenarios using the delta method one of the simplest ways to statistically downscale gcm projections is to use the delta or change factor method trzaska and schnarr 2014 the change factor Œ¥ is the ratio between the gcm simulations of future and current climate and is used as a multiplicative factor to obtain future regional conditions this method assumes that gcms simulate relative changes more reliably than absolute values hay et al 2000 therefore climate variables can be projected as follows 9 v f Œ¥ j v p s where vf is the daily mean projected climate variable vps is the daily mean present climate variable observed or reference data and Œ¥ j is the monthly change factor which can be calculated as follows 10 Œ¥ j v f g c m j v h g c m j where j is month and v h g c m and v f g c m are mean monthly values of the gcm variable for historical and future conditions respectively which can be calculated as follows 11 v g c m j n 1 n v n g c m j n where n is the number of ensembles j is month n is the ensemble number 1 2 3 n and v n g c m j is the mean monthly value of the gcm variable for the ensemble member n which is calculated as follows 12 v n g c m j i 1 60 v n i g c m j 60 where j is month i is the year number 1 2 3 60 and v n i g c m j is the monthly value of the gcm variable for the n th member 4 2 1 projection of precipitation the observed daily rainfall from 2002 to 2009 over the basin was collected to represent the present climate conditions the future precipitation amounts for different climate scenarios were projected using eq 9 to obtain the delta factor of precipitation for each month monthly precipitation extracted from d4pdf is used as the j th monthly value of the gcm climate variable v n i g c m j for the i th year in the n th member in eq 12 the delta factor of precipitation for different climate scenarios can then be obtained using eqs 11 and 10 respectively 4 2 2 projection of actual evapotranspiration to simulate long term river flow actual evapotranspiration aet is another necessary input parameter however it is the most difficult parameter to measure in the field of basin hydrology meema et al 2020 estimated the aet for the nnrb with a daily average of 2 78 mm day using the water balance method the difference in the amount of water between annual precipitation and river discharge for this study we adopted this information as the aet for the present climate scenario to project the future aet in different climate scenarios eq 9 is adopted to calculate the delta factor for aet a combination of the simulated amount of water transferred from the global surface into the atmosphere including the water transpiration from soil ts the evaporation on soil es and the evaporation on the leaf el in different climate scenarios obtained from d4pdf was used as the monthly value of the gcm climate variable in eq 12 then the delta factor of the aet for different climate scenarios could be obtained using eqs 11 and 10 respectively 4 2 3 projection of reservoir evaporation the estimated evaporation from a water body for nnbr with a mean daily value of 2 4 mm day estimated by meema et al 2020 was adopted as the present reservoir evaporation loss for the future projection of reservoir evaporation loss due to climate change assuming that the pan coefficient of 0 7 has no significant change in future conditions the delta factor of the basin potential evaporation between historical and future conditions is used to multiply with the present reservoir evaporation similar to eq 9 to calculate the delta factor of reservoir evaporation the basin average mean monthly temperature in different climate scenarios was extracted from d4pdf to estimate the potential evaporation of the basin using the thornthwaite method thornthwaite 1948 which is used as the monthly value of the gcm variable in eq 12 the delta factor can then be calculated using eqs 11 and 10 respectively 4 3 simulation scenarios dam development and climate change the combination scenarios between upstream dam development and climate change were conducted to investigate the uncertainty in basin hydrology and dam operation a list of simulated scenarios is provided in table 4 to assess uncertainty due to dam development three stages of dam development no dam nd existing dam ed and future dam fd were conducted in this study we focused on a large scale dam that has many effects on river flow due to its regulation based on the large scale dam criteria in the mekong tributaries piman et al 2016 nn1 and nn2 met the criteria for the ed stage whereas nam ngum 3 nn3 met the criteria for the fd stage to assess the uncertainty of different climate projections on precipitation and actual evapotranspiration 15 climate scenarios were established 1 for present 7 for 2 k and 7 for 4 k the present climate scenario bl refers to historical data

reference data and the 100 member ensemble d4pdf basin averaged monthly precipitation estimates the purpose of this study was to demonstrate the performance of the gcm d4pdf in comparison with the observation data the analysis presented a difference in magnitude with the gcm d4pdf over predicting precipitation during the dry season especially in march and april and under prediction during the wet season in june and july conversely the climate model effectively captured the seasonal variation with the observed data this demonstrates that the historical experiment of gcm d4pdf shows an agreement in seasonal variation with the reference observed data and is appropriate to adopt to project the climate variables from the present climate in various scenarios using the delta change method to assess the uncertainty of climate projections for the nnrb fig 5 b illustrates the mean monthly basin precipitation trends for all climate scenarios in the 2 and 4 increase experiments from the gcm prediction the monthly delta changes factor obtained by analyzing the gcm data set ranged from 0 73 to 1 36 for 2 k scenarios and ranged from 0 71 to 1 50 for 4 k scenarios this shows that the range of change in precipitation is much larger when the temperature increases although the range of the delta change in the dry season seems similar to that in the wet season 0 71 1 44 for the dry season and 0 73 1 50 for the wet season a primary difference in the prediction of precipitation magnitude occurs during the wet season especially in july and august by using the delta factors obtained by analyzing the d4pdf dataset with the observed precipitation present climate precipitation projections in different climate scenarios were predicted as shown in fig 5 c based on the average daily accumulation for all climate scenarios the climate projections describe a range of changes in mean annual precipitation compared to historical observed data from 5 5 to 4 9 for 2 k scenarios and from 9 6 to 6 9 for 4 k scenarios similar to the delta change factors a significant change in the amount of projected precipitation occurs in the wet season especially in july and august the average pattern of the 2 k climate scenario 2k avr results in a slight increase 0 35 increase in mean annual precipitation compared to the observation present climate and a slight reduction 0 64 reduction resulted in an average pattern of the 4 k climate scenario 4k avr 5 1 2 actual evapotranspiration projections fig 6 a shows the mean monthly aet for various climate scenarios obtained from the gcm d4pdf prediction the estimated amount of water transferred to the atmosphere tends to increase as the temperature increases the monthly delta changes factor obtained by analyzing the gcm data set for 2 k scenarios is ranged from 0 91 to 1 10 for 4 k scenarios is ranged from 0 91 to 1 15 by using the delta factors obtained by analyzing the d4pdf dataset fig 6a with the references aet the aet projection in different climate scenarios was predicted as shown in fig 6 b under the climate projections the range of increase in mean annual aet compared to the reference present climate varies from 0 57 to 3 78 for 2 k scenarios and from 4 50 to 7 94 for 4 k scenarios all climate scenarios show the highest amount of aet during april and may in which this period has a high temperature with a moderate precipitation amount the average pattern of the 2 k climate scenario 2k avr results in a 2 8 average daily value 0 57 increase from the present climate and a 2 95 5 96 increase resulted in an average pattern of 4 k climate scenario 4k avr according to the projected aet increasing the temperature results in an increase in the potential of water transferred to the atmosphere leading to fewer water resources available in the basin 5 2 climate change and hydropower development impact on river flow river flow downstream of the nn1 reservoir was used to analyze the impacts of climate change and hydropower development on annual and seasonal flow changes a comparison of the annual and seasonal flows for all scenarios is summarized in table 5 5 2 1 climate change impact on natural condition flow a simulation without dams was conducted to assess the impact of climate change on river flow without the impact of dam operation fig 7 shows a comparison of the average monthly flows in various climate scenarios a comparison between different climate scenarios shows that the change in average annual flow compared to the present climate scenario nd ps ranges from 12 5 to 3 3 for 2 k scenarios and from 21 7 to 3 5 for 4 k scenarios with a significant difference in magnitude in the wet season july august and september similar to the projection of precipitation the average of 2 k 2k avr and 4 k 4k avr climate scenarios showed a decreasing trend in the annual river flow of 4 4 and 8 1 respectively 5 2 2 climate change impact on nam song water diversion to predict the amount of water diversion in different climate scenarios we adopted the ratio between the simulated flow in the present climate condition and the discharge of the diversion record and then applied the ratio with the simulated river discharge for each climate scenario the diverted water discharge is limited to the maximum diversion capacity fig 8 a presents the change in mean monthly water availability at the diversion headwork nam song river in different climate scenarios in which the mean annual flow varies from 7 5 to 6 3 for 2 k scenarios and from 15 7 to 8 1 for 4 k scenarios compared with present climate scenarios fig 8 b presents the change in mean monthly water diversion from the nam song at diversion headwork to the nn1 reservoir in different climate scenarios where the mean annual diversion discharge varied from 4 5 to 2 2 for 2 k scenarios and from 9 6 to 6 1 for 4 k scenarios compared with the present climate scenarios according to the simulation results climate change has a less significant effect on the total amount of water diversion from the nam song river to the nn1 reservoir compared to the change in water availability at the diversion headwork inflow of the nam song dam for example in the case of the 4k mi climate scenario the greatest reduction of river flow the reduction of water transfer to the nn1 reservoir is only a 1 5 reduction from the nn1 reservoir total inflow compared to the present climate scenario with ed conditions ed ps 5 2 3 climate change impact on river flow with existing dam condition fig 9 a describes the impact of climate change on the inflow of the nn1 reservoir with the ed conditions the change in the annual inflow ranges from 8 3 to 5 9 for 2 k scenarios and from 16 7 to 6 5 for 4 k scenarios compared to the present climate scenario ed ps to assess the combined effect of climate change and dam development the degree of change in the river flow was compared with the natural flow condition nd ps and a range of change in the mean annual inflow from 0 3 to 28 2 was found a significant change in seasonal flow inflow of nn1 due to upstream dam development in different climate scenarios compared with natural flow conditions nd ps varies from 74 1 to 117 3 in the dry season and 18 to 8 2 in the wet season a significant alteration in the seasonal inflow of nn1 is mainly due to the regulation of a large storage dam such as nn2 with an effective storage capacity of 2617 mcm fig 9 b describes the impact of climate change on the regulated flow of the nn1 reservoir with inflow from the existing upstream dam condition the change in the annual regulated flow downstream of the nn1 reservoir for different climate scenarios ranged from 8 7 to 5 7 for 2 k scenarios and from 15 8 to 5 8 for 4 k scenarios compared to the present climate scenario ed ps the effect of the nn1 reservoir regulation with a large effective storage of 4714 mcm was assessed by comparing the seasonal flow change between the predicted inflow fig 9a and regulated flow fig 9b for each climate condition the simulation result shows a 49 0 22 9 reduction in the wet season and a 44 2 56 1 increase in the dry season 5 2 4

conditions ns dv nl nn2 and nn3 the change in the annual inflow of the nn1 reservoir for different climate scenarios ranged from 8 0 to 5 6 for 2 k scenarios and from 16 2 to 6 3 for 4 k scenarios compared with the present climate scenario fd ps the inflow of the nn1 reservoir becomes more stable a slight decrease in seasonal variation due to an increase in the regulated storage of the upstream dams an additional power station nn3 with an effective storage of 1070 mcm was considered in this simulation to assess the impact of nn3 regulation on the inflow of nn1 the simulated inflow for fd development conditions fig 10a was compared with the ed condition fig 9a for each climate scenario the results show that there is a slight reduction of 0 2 2 6 in the wet season inflow and a slight increase of 2 4 5 3 in the dry season inflow of the nn1 reservoir fig 10 b shows the impact of climate change on the regulated flow of the nn1 reservoir downstream with fd conditions the change in the annual river flow downstream of the nn1 reservoir for different climate scenarios ranged from 8 4 to 5 4 for 2 k scenarios and from 15 5 to 5 6 for 4 k scenarios compared with the present climate scenario fd ps the primary change in seasonal river flow due to dam development in different climate scenarios compared with natural flow conditions nd ps downstream of the nn1 reservoir varied from 48 8 to 23 1 in the wet season and 196 0 to 217 8 in the dry season to assess the impact of the nn3 operation on the regulated flow of nn1 the regulated flow under the fd condition fig 10b is compared to the river flow under the ed condition fig 9b for each climate scenario the results show that there is no primary change in the regulated flow from the nn1 reservoir to the downstream because the regulated potential of nn3 effective storage of 1070 mcm is approximately only 9 0 range from 8 2 10 4 of the mean predicted total inflow of nn1 for different climate scenarios with fd conditions this agrees with meema et al 2020 that major large scale hydropower dams have already been developed which can regulate most river flows in the basin by comparing the individual effects of climate change and dam development with the natural flow condition nd ps the changing climate has a primary effect in terms of the total amount of water availability mean annual river flow due to the combined effect of precipitation change and aet increase a significant effect occurs during the wet season due to a change in the magnitude of precipitation leading to a change in river flow only a slight change in seasonal flow driven by climate change was observed in this study dam development in the basin has a primary effect in terms of seasonal flow variation due to regulation using storage furthermore not only a primary change in seasonal flow but dam development with a river diversion type from another catchment results in increasing of mean annual river flow as well the simulation results demonstrate that the large scale dam reservoir which can control a large volume of water in the basin plays an important role in water resource management 5 3 link between projected precipitation evaporation inflow and regulated flow the model includes soil and bedrock aquifers that respond to the natural storage of the basin during the dry season the amount of precipitation is lower than that of aet and the storage is the primary contributor to the basin although some effective rainfall occurs precipitation aet during the beginning of the wet season may and june most rainwater infiltrates into the aquifers therefore the hydrograph of river flow fig 7 shows a minor difference during these periods the highest amount of precipitation occurs in july and august and effective rainfall is sufficient to become surface flow the magnitude of river flow is dependent on the amount of projected precipitation resulting in a primary difference in the river flow hydrograph as shown in fig 7 in september and october the storages become fully filled from the previous months and most effective rainwater becomes surface runoff a combination of groundwater and surface flow results in a significantly higher difference in river flow compared to precipitation the major difference in regulated flow among the scenarios was due to the spillage water in this study we assumed that the operation follows the present operation therefore during the dry season including the beginning of wet seasons such as june and july the amount of reservoir inflow can be controlled by the reservoir storage current storage st maximum storage smax therefore the comparison of regulated flow for various scenarios is quite similar as shown in figs 9 and 10 during the mid to late wet seasons august to october significant spilling occurs st smax when river discharge has an increasing trend leading to a significant difference in regulated flow during this period as shown in figs 9 and 10 although a larger difference in precipitation was observed in july and august the primary difference in regulated flow from nn1 was found in august to october due to the storage capacity regulated capacity of the reservoirs in this study the hydrological residence time hrt of the nn1 nn2 and nn3 reservoirs for the present climate scenarios with fd condition are 0 39 0 46 and 0 41 year respectively hrt year effective storage capacity mcm inflow mcm year conversely when the hrt decreases the regulated hydrograph is closer to the inflow hydrograph 5 4 climate change impact on reservoir water level and water spillage fig 11 a presents a comparison of the mean monthly water level of the nn1 reservoir in different climate scenarios with ed conditions a change of mean water level for different climate scenarios compared with present climate scenarios ed ps is varied from 0 63 to 0 12 m for 2 k scenarios and from 2 86 to 0 41 m for 4 k scenarios for the average climate scenarios such as 2k avr and 4k avr the reduction in mean reservoir water level is 0 12 and 0 34 m respectively fig 11 b presents a comparison of the mean monthly water level of the nn1 reservoir in different climate scenarios with fd conditions the tendency of the mean monthly reservoir water level is quite similar to that of the ed condition fig 11a but the trend is slightly increased by using the same operation pattern more stable inflow increase in the dry season flow and decrease in the wet season due to an increase in the regulation capacity of the upstream dam results in slightly higher water levels in the reservoir resulting in a 0 18 0 36 m increase in mean reservoir water level compared with the ed condition for each climate scenario table 6 summaries the mean annual reservoir water and the total amount of water spillage from the nn1 reservoir in different simulation scenarios the mean annual amount of water spillage for all simulation scenarios is ranged from 0 to 921 6 mcm for each dam development condition the mean annual water spillage trends to increase when the mean reservoir water level increases to assess the effect of dam development on water spills from the nn1 reservoir the amount of water spillage for each climate scenario between the ed and fd conditions was compared it was revealed that although all climate scenarios in fd result in an increase in mean water level compared with ed some climate scenarios result in a reduction of a water spill this demonstrated that the amount of water spillage is not only a function of the water level but also other factors for example in the case 4k mr although the mean water level in fd has a 0 2 m higher than ed the water spillage is reduced by 42 0 because the water level in fd is generally higher than ed during the period without spills spills usually occur in september and october and the regulated flow from the upstream in the fd condition is more appropriate for power generation most water is used to generate power through the turbines leading to less water spillage through the spillway the water level of the nn1 reservoir seems to have less fluctuation when there are more reservoirs upstream because of its regulated flow which tends to increase the nn1 inflow in the dry season and decrease in the wet season the water spill is the amount of water released through the spillway without generating electricity when the current reservoir storage exceeds the maximum storage thus to use water effectively the operation of the reservoir should be considered to avoid the water spillage 5 5 climate change impact on hydropower production the hydrologic impact on hydropower production was analyzed considering the overall effect on climate change and upstream dam development the simulation results of the mean annual energy production for different simulation scenarios are listed in table 7 fig 12 a presents a comparison of the mean monthly energy product of the nn1 power station in different climate scenarios with the ed development conditions under projected climate scenarios the difference in mean annual energy production compared to the present climate ed ps varies from 8 4 to 1 9 for 2 k scenarios and from 19 5 to 2 8 for 4 k scenarios its reduction in energy production due to a reduction in inflow to the reservoir and a decrease in reservoir water level leading to generated hydraulic head reduction results in decreased energy production fig 12 b illustrates a comparison of the mean monthly energy product of the nn1 power station in different climate scenarios with the fd development conditions the change in mean annual energy production from the present climate fd ps for different projected climate scenarios is quite similar to a change in the ed development conditions to demonstrate the effect of upstream cascade dam development on energy production of the nn1 power station the mean monthly energy between the existing fig 12a and future fig 12b dam development conditions were compared for each climate scenario under the fd development level the annual energy production of the nn1 power station has a slightly increasing trend due to more upstream reservoirs in operation the construction of upstream cascade dams improves the stabilization between the wet and dry seasons of inflow to the nn1 reservoir leading to an improvement in the reservoir water level and thus increasing the potential for power generation and total energy production however a general trend 2k avr and 4k avr seems to indicate a reduction in the annual energy product when the projected temperature is increased 5 6 climate change impact on water loss from the reservoir the mean monthly evaporation rate from the water body was placed at the reservoirs to account for the net amount of water loss due to evaporation from the water surface of the reservoirs the differences in water loss from the nn1 reservoir for the different simulation scenarios are summarized in table 8 fig 13 a presents a comparison of the mean monthly amount of water loss from the nn1 reservoir in different climate scenarios with the ed development conditions the amount of water loss due to evaporation in different climate scenarios varies from 9 2 to 13 4 for 2 k scenarios and from 24 5 to 35 6 for 4 k scenarios compared to the present climate with the ed development stage ed ps although the evaporation loss rates in november and december were significantly lower than those in march and april as shown in fig 13c the net amount of water loss was quite similar as shown in fig 13a the operation pattern tries to maintain the water in the reservoir at a high level at the end of the rainy season and the beginning of the dry season leading to an increase in free water surface area which results in a high amount of water loss fig 13 b presents a comparison of the mean monthly amount of water loss from the nn1 reservoir in different climate scenarios with the fd development conditions the tendency of water loss from the reservoir in different climate scenarios compared to the present climate fd ps is quite similar to the ed development conditions by comparing the simulation results under different climate scenarios between the fd condition fig 13b and the ed condition fig 13a to assess the impact of fd development on the projected amount of water loss from the nn1 reservoir there is a slight increase in actual water loss as the water level increases the reservoir water surface area increases which results in an additional amount of water loss due to evaporation the amount of water loss from the reservoir in the present ed ps is approximately 2 4 of the total inflow of the nn1 reservoir however under the projected climate scenarios the amount of water loss from the nn1 reservoir due to evaporation will increase to approximately 2 7 and 3 2 of the present mean annual inflow for the 2 k and 4 k temperature increase scenarios respectively 2k avr and 4k avr assume that the total amount of water loss due to evaporation can be used to utilize the hydropower an approximately 3 6 and 9 4 gw h year of additional energy production for the nn1 power station will be lost when the temperature increases by 2 k and 4 k respectively 2k avr and 4k avr 5 7 reservoir operation strategy to cope with climate change as hydropower production is strongly related to inflow the power generation for the nn1 power station could vary significantly owing to large variations in inflow projections to mitigate variability implementing strategies such as changing the existing operation is necessary fig 14 shows the implementation of reservoir operation of the nn1 reservoir for the increasing trend of inflow for example the 4k ha scenario fig 14 a shows the implementation by dropping the level of the nn1 rule curve to avoid a spill by decreasing the rule curve to a lower level the results show that water spills tend to decrease and energy production tends to increase although decreasing the level of the rule curve over 2 5 m results in a higher reduction of the water spill the head is reduced resulting in less power output the maximum increase in energy output has resulted when dropping the rule curve by 2 5 m with a 1 7 increase in energy production compared to the existing rule curve dropping 0 m fig 14 b shows the implementation by increasing the installed power capacity it is possible that in terms of the future inflow trend has increased stakeholders can consider installing more capacity to utilize additional water to generate more power engineering design and construction processes are also required furthermore by increasing the power capacity the implementation cost should be considered against the benefit of an increase in energy production by increasing the capacity with the existing rule curve the results show that water spills tend to decrease and energy production tends to increase although the water spillage is decreased when the capacity is increased above 10 it results in less energy output because a large amount of water is discharged downstream which results in a reduction in the water level in the reservoir reduction head leading to less power generation the maximum increase in energy output was observed when the capacity was increased by 10 with a 3 8 increase in energy production compared to the existing capacity fig 15 shows the implementation of reservoir operation of the nn1 reservoir by changing the rule curve for the decreasing trend of inflow for example the fd 4k mi scenario fig 15 a shows the shifting elevation of the nn1 rule curve at different levels fig 15 b shows the implementation of the nn1 reservoir by shifting the rule curve to a higher level by shifting the rule curve as shown in fig 15a a higher hydraulic head is provided because higher reservoir water levels result in increased energy production as a result of the higher water level the water spillage tended to increase although the water level in the reservoir is increased when shifting the rule curve with an average shift elevation higher than 2 5 m the energy output tends to decrease because of the higher water spill the maximum increase in energy output has resulted when shifting the rule curve of the nn1 reservoir by 2 5 m on average with a 5 4 increase in energy production compared to the rule curve 6 conclusion a change in long term river flow projection covers a wide range dominated mainly by the difference in precipitation projections the mean climate projections of the 2 k and 4 k scenarios 2k avr and 4k avr show a slight decrease in the mean annual river flow although climate change has a primary effect on river flow in total annual amount the impact on seasonal flow change is quite low compared to the effect of dam development the effect of dam development shows a significant reduction in seasonal flow variation downstream of the nn1 reservoir regulated flow in all climate scenarios compared to the natural flow condition nd at the fd stage all climate scenarios show a distinct trend of change in seasonal flow compared to the ed stage with a slight increase in the dry season and a slight decrease in the wet season due to an additional regulated storage of the under construction dam nn3 the estimation of energy production of the nn1 power station under climate projections shows a large variation in the mean annual energy output due to the uncertainty of river flow projections in different climate scenarios at the fd stage the annual energy production has a slightly increasing trend compared to the ed development stage because of the regulated flow from the storage of the upstream cascade dam with an increase in temperature projections the nnbr seems to face a decreasing trend in future precipitation a combination of precipitation reduction and high temperatures resulted in a reduction in river flow and hydropower production without any implementation the existing operation will lead to a loss in the annual energy production thus adaptive implementations are necessary to mitigate the impact of climate change on long term hydropower generation the rule curve needs to be effectively managed to optimize hydropower production while other related purposes such as downstream flood risk water demand deficit ecosystems and social vulnerability are minimized based on our approach for this study there are some limitations first by using the delta method to project climate variables there is a lack of change in the variability and spatial patterns of climate a gcm downscale including a bias correction process might be required to access the spatial distribution and variability of the projected climate second this study assumed that the hydrologic variables that have an influence on river flow projection including basin land cover do not change in future studies land use change and upstream water use e g for irrigation should be considered the operation of a large scale dam with a large storage capacity can play a primary role in water resource management in the river basin to improve the efficiency of reservoir operation the consideration of forecast information should be carried out however the hydrological forecast has significant uncertainties and it is difficult to predict future conditions perfectly nohara et al 2016 applied the ensemble prediction technique to support preliminary operation of the reservoir the information including the possible conditions and the uncertainty of prediction can be important for more effective decision strategy for the reservoir real time operation author statement thatkiat meema conceptualization methodology analysis software visualization

8199,study region the nam ngum river basin the major tributary of the mekong river is located in the laos pdr study focus this study aims to assess the sensitivity of nam ngum 1 reservoir operation to water resource uncertainty driven by a combination of climate change and upstream cascade dam development new hydrological insights for the region precipitation projections of the basin under a 4 increase scenario vary in the range of 9 6 to 6 9 compared to the historical observed precipitation present climate the impact of climate change on hydropower resources was investigated based on the combined effect of climate change and upstream cascade dam development the projected inflow of the nam ngum 1 reservoir at the full development stage will change from 16 0 to 6 5 which results in a large range of annual energy production changes from 18 8 to 2 8 compared to the current condition present climate and existing dam stage furthermore water losses from the reservoir due to water discharge from the spillway for extreme floods and evaporation are expected to increase with increasing temperature which will lead to a loss in energy production our study indicates that the operation of hydropower should be adapted to the effects of climate change this information can be used by stakeholders to propose water resource management strategies keywords climate change

myanmar lao pdr thailand and cambodia before entering the south china sea via a complex delta system in viet nam with an approximately 795 000 km2 of the total basin area the mekong river ranks 10th among the world s great rivers based on mean annual flow mrc 2005 rapid regional growth and energy demands from neighboring countries have prompted the construction of numerous dams along the mainstream and tributaries of the mekong river kummu and varis 2007 the catchment area of mekong river in laos pdr is approximately 25 of the total basin and contributes 35 of the total flow into the river which is considered to be the country with the highest contribution in the mekong river basin mrb mrc 2005 the country has benefits in terms of topography and water resources which provide significant potential for hydropower development adb 2019 reported that the country s exploitable hydro potential is estimated to be 23 000 mw and 5 172 mw of hydropower capacity had been operated as

variations in changes in hydropower generation across regions and even within regions due to the effects of climate change have been reported hamududu and killingtveit 2012 the uncertainty of future hydropower generation is derived not only by the current river flow inter annual variation but also by the change in long term river flow availability due to the effect of climate change blackshear et al 2011 several previous studies have assessed the impact of climate change on hydropower generation on a global scale hamududu and killingtveit 2012 van vliet et al 2016 continental scale iea 2020

the mekong tributaries srepok sesan and sekong 3s basins during full development driven by a2 and b2 emission scenarios mpi echam4 compared to the baseline scenario however the significant uncertainty in hydropower production assessment is associated with the variability of precipitation projections hamlet et al 2010 resulting from the use of different general circulation models gcms the model projections are affected by a range of uncertainties including emissions scenario uncertainty internal variability of the climate system and model response uncertainty hawkins and sutton 2009 the

2018 extreme floods and river discharge tanaka et al 2020 hanittinan et al 2020 information about the adaptability of hydropower generation to hydrologic changes and global warming effects in the region is scarce especially for large scale dams in the main tributaries of the mekong thus this study aims to assess the combined impacts of climate change and dam development in a tributary of the mekong river in laos pdr nam ngum river on hydropower generation using a large ensemble of climate projections for this purpose a physically based distributed hydrologic model meema and tachikawa 2020 was adopted with the projected climate variables using the delta method for different climate scenarios obtained from a large gcm ensemble database d4pdf the mean of the projected climate ensembles from each climate scenario was used to evaluate the change in water resources and power production at different dam development stages of the basin furthermore the results of the study demonstrate that implementation strategies for an adaptive reservoir operation are needed to mitigate the impact of climate change 2 description of study area 2 1 nam ngum river basin the nam ngum river basin nnrb is the main mekong tributary located in the central part of lao pdr the basin is one of the most significant areas in lao pdr in terms of size approximately 16 800 km2 and 7 of the country area annual flows contributing to the mainstream of the mekong river are approximately 14 which accounts for approximately 40 of the country s contribution to the mekong river flow the headwaters of the nam ngum river are at an elevation of 2 800 m in the northeast of the basin and heads southward for 420 km to its outlet at the mekong river downstream of the nam ngum 1 reservoir nn1 the nam ngum river has a gentle slope as it meanders along its course the vientiane plain extends from each bank covering an area of approximately 2 000 km2 at elevations of 160 180 m during the wet season the plains are influenced by flooding in the floodplain the average annual discharge of the nam ngum river to mekong is approximately 21 000 million cubic meters mcm the flows are highly seasonal with low flow occurring from march to april and high flow occurring from august to september the nam ngum basin is largely tropical with a distinct wet season from june to october and a dry season for the rest of the year the highest temperature is in march and april where average temperatures range from 30 c to 38 c depending on location and altitude the lowest temperatures occur between november and february with an average of 15 c at higher elevations the xiengkhuang plateau the mean annual rainfall of the basin is approximately 2 000 mm ranging from 1 450 mm to 3 500 mm across the basin the highest amount of rainfall occurred near the vangvieng area and gradually decreased northeastward to the xiengkhuang vicinity 2 2 water resources development currently six hydroelectricity related schemes are located in the nnrb with a total reservoir storage of approximately 15 200 mcm and a combined electricity generation capacity of 990 mw the first hydropower station in the basin was the nn1 reservoir which was developed in 1971 with an installed capacity of 155 mw the nn1 scheme the largest among the six hydropower schemes has a storage capacity of 7 010 mcm the nam song diversion project ns dv operated in 1996 diverts approximately 3650 mcm year of water from the nam song river into the nn1 reservoir the other two hydropower stations nam ngum 2 nn2 and nam lik 1 2 reservoirs began operation in 2011 with installed capacities of 615 mw and 100 mw respectively nn2 is the major power station located upstream of the nn1 reservoir with the largest power capacity and second largest storage volume of 6270 mcm among the dams in the basin in 2012 the nam ngum 5 nn5 hydropower station began operation with an installed capacity of 120 mw the dam is located on the tributary of the nam ngum river nam ting river in addition the nam leuk nl and the nam mang hydropower dams located outside of the nam ngum basin began operation in 2000 and 2005 respectively diverting water from the nl and nam mang basins into the nn1 reservoir and the vientiane plain respectively the nnbr has significant hydropower potential with high rainfall and large differences in elevation an additional four dams are at various stages of development ranging from planning to construction in the case where all dams are constructed the total power generation capacity is 1 900 mw and the total storage volume is 17 200 mcm which is approximately 80 of the total annual river discharge of the nam ngum river the locations of the hydropower stations are shown in fig 1 and a list of hydropower stations in the basin is summarized in table 1 3 coupled simulation model for hydrological reservoir and hydropower generation the 1 k dhm is a distributed hydrological model based on a kinematic wave flow approximation that considers surface subsurface flow the elevation and flow direction were determined using topographical data provided by hydrosheds lehner et al 2006 with digital elevation models dems in 30 s approximately 1 km resolution meema and tachikawa 2020 improved the 1 k dhm for long term river flow simulation to assess the impact of hydropower operation and it was extended by incorporating the reservoir hydropower plant process into the model in the nnrb meema et al 2020 the model was calibrated from 2002 to 2005 in which the hydrologic parameters and reservoir operation of the nn1 operation rules were optimized to perform the simulation in agreement with the actual operation record validation period 1 2006 2009 presents the condition without nn2 and validation period

level and energy production of the nn1 power station during the calibration and validation processes as shown in the comparison between the simulated result and the record in fig 2 and the summary of model performances in table 2 the calibrated hydrologic parameters and reservoir operation data rule curve and operation rules were collected the coupled 1 k dhm consists of two main processes hydrological processes and reservoir hydropower plant processes as shown in the schematic drawing in fig 3 a general description of each process is discussed in the following subsections 3 1 hydrologic processes each grid of the hydrological process consists of river and slope flow components tanaka and tachikawa 2015 to improve long term river flow simulation meema and tachikawa 2020 improved the structure of the slope flow component by incorporating an unconfined bedrock aquifer layer into the model a combination of discharge from both layers contributes to the river channel component as the lateral discharge per unit length the modification of the slope flow model consists of a surface soil layer original model and a bedrock aquifer layer the continuity and momentum

the actual cross sectional area of flow in the rock fracture and i is the gradient of the hillslope 3 2 reservoir and hydropower plant processes reservoir hydropower plant processes are the processes of reservoir routing and hydropower generation in which the release discharge to the downstream grid is determined using the reservoir guide curve rule curve method release flows are specified for each time step as well as the reservoir level and spillage the generated discharge discharge through the turbines is determined by using the release decision model based on the multiple zones of the reservoir and their operating rules as shown in fig 4 as an example input to the model for the nn1 reservoir fig 4 includes three curves the full supply level guide curve can have more than one curve for any reservoir and minimum operation level the guide curve has two purposes to guide the reservoir water level which the model tries as much as possible to follow and to separate the zones the zones that are separated are referred to as the multiple zones of the reservoir the numbers below the figure each value for each month in each zone are the generation time per day in hour we call this as operation rules of the zone in this study we collected this value from the actual operation record during the calibration period 2002 2005 as the input of the model this process provides the target of energy generation that evaluates the release to obtain the reservoir water level to the guide curve rule curve at the end of the time step as much as possible based on the starting reservoir water

assigned the amount of water diversion as the boundary condition in the model the diversion records from 2002 to 2009 for the nam song diversion dam ns dv and the nl dam were used to determine the diversion amount from the dams in the present climate scenario to predict the amount of water diversion in different climate scenarios we assumed that the operation of the diversion dams was based on the amount of inflow therefore we adopted the monthly ratio between the simulated flow in the present climate condition and the discharge of the diversion record then we applied the ratio with the simulated river discharge for each climate scenario the diverted water discharge was limited to the maximum diversion capacity 200 m3 s for ns dv and 60 m3 s for nl the amount of water diversion can be calculated as follows 7 q d v s i m i j k i j q i n s i m i j where j is month i is the year 2002 2003 2009 q i n s i m is simulated inflow to the diversion dam q d v s i m is simulated diversion

component the 6 Œ¥ssts contained a 15 member ensemble yielding a total of 90 members for the 2 k simulation the global mean surface air temperature was considered to be 2 c warmer than in the pre industrial era and the ghgs were set to the values in 2040 of the rcp8 5 scenario fujita et al 2019 the same six cmip5 models as in the 4 k simulation were used as the Œ¥ssts of the agcm each of the six Œ¥ssts contained a 9 member ensemble yielding a total of 54 members 4 2 climate projection scenarios using the delta method one of the simplest ways to statistically downscale gcm projections is to use the delta or change factor method trzaska and schnarr 2014 the change factor Œ¥ is the ratio between the gcm simulations of future and current climate and is used as a multiplicative factor to obtain future regional conditions this method assumes that gcms simulate relative changes more reliably than absolute values hay et al 2000 therefore climate variables can be projected as follows 9 v f Œ¥ j v p s where vf is the daily mean projected climate variable vps is the daily mean present climate variable observed or reference data and Œ¥ j is the monthly change factor which can be calculated as follows 10 Œ¥ j v f g c m j v h g c m j where j is month and v h g c m and v f g c m are mean monthly values of the gcm variable for historical and future conditions respectively which can be calculated as follows 11 v g c m j n 1 n v n g c m j n where n is the number of ensembles j is month n is the ensemble number 1 2 3 n and v n g c m j is the mean monthly value of the gcm variable for the ensemble member n which is calculated as follows 12 v n g c m j i 1 60 v n i g c m j 60 where j is month i is the year number 1 2 3 60 and v n i g c m j is the monthly value of the gcm variable for the n th member 4 2 1 projection of precipitation the observed daily rainfall from 2002 to 2009 over the basin was collected to represent the present climate conditions the future precipitation amounts for different climate scenarios were projected using eq 9 to obtain the delta factor of precipitation for each month monthly precipitation extracted from d4pdf is used as the j th monthly value of the gcm climate variable v n i g c m j for the i th year in the n th member in eq 12 the delta factor of precipitation for different climate scenarios can then be obtained using eqs 11 and 10 respectively 4 2 2 projection of actual evapotranspiration to simulate long term river flow actual evapotranspiration aet is another necessary input parameter however it is the most difficult parameter to measure in the field of basin hydrology meema et al 2020 estimated the aet for the nnrb with a daily average of 2 78 mm day using the water balance method the difference in the amount of water between annual precipitation and river discharge for this study we adopted this information as the aet for the present climate scenario to project the future aet in different climate scenarios eq 9 is adopted to calculate the delta factor for aet a combination of the simulated amount of water transferred from the global surface into the atmosphere including the water transpiration from soil ts the evaporation on soil es and the evaporation on the leaf el in different climate scenarios obtained from d4pdf was used as the monthly value of the gcm climate variable in eq 12 then the delta factor of the aet for different climate scenarios could be obtained using eqs 11 and 10 respectively 4 2 3 projection of reservoir evaporation the estimated evaporation from a water body for nnbr with a mean daily value of 2 4 mm day estimated by meema et al 2020 was adopted as the present reservoir evaporation loss for the future projection of reservoir evaporation loss due to climate change assuming that the pan coefficient of 0 7 has no significant change in future conditions the delta factor of the basin potential evaporation between historical and future conditions is used to multiply with the present reservoir evaporation similar to eq 9 to calculate the delta factor of reservoir evaporation the basin average mean monthly temperature in different climate scenarios was extracted from d4pdf to estimate the potential evaporation of the basin using the thornthwaite method thornthwaite 1948 which is used as the monthly value of the gcm variable in eq 12 the delta factor can then be calculated using eqs 11 and 10 respectively 4 3 simulation scenarios dam development and climate change the combination scenarios between upstream dam development and climate change were conducted to investigate the uncertainty in basin hydrology and dam operation a list of simulated scenarios is provided in table 4 to assess uncertainty due to dam development three stages of dam development no dam nd existing dam ed and future dam fd were conducted in this study we focused on a large scale dam that has many effects on river flow due to its regulation based on the large scale dam criteria in the mekong tributaries piman et al 2016 nn1 and nn2 met the criteria for the ed stage whereas nam ngum 3 nn3 met the criteria for the fd stage to assess the uncertainty of different climate projections on precipitation and actual evapotranspiration 15 climate scenarios were established 1 for present 7 for 2 k and 7 for 4 k the present climate scenario bl refers to historical data

reference data and the 100 member ensemble d4pdf basin averaged monthly precipitation estimates the purpose of this study was to demonstrate the performance of the gcm d4pdf in comparison with the observation data the analysis presented a difference in magnitude with the gcm d4pdf over predicting precipitation during the dry season especially in march and april and under prediction during the wet season in june and july conversely the climate model effectively captured the seasonal variation with the observed data this demonstrates that the historical experiment of gcm d4pdf shows an agreement in seasonal variation with the reference observed data and is appropriate to adopt to project the climate variables from the present climate in various scenarios using the delta change method to assess the uncertainty of climate projections for the nnrb fig 5 b illustrates the mean monthly basin precipitation trends for all climate scenarios in the 2 and 4 increase experiments from the gcm prediction the monthly delta changes factor obtained by analyzing the gcm data set ranged from 0 73 to 1 36 for 2 k scenarios and ranged from 0 71 to 1 50 for 4 k scenarios this shows that the range of change in precipitation is much larger when the temperature increases although the range of the delta change in the dry season seems similar to that in the wet season 0 71 1 44 for the dry season and 0 73 1 50 for the wet season a primary difference in the prediction of precipitation magnitude occurs during the wet season especially in july and august by using the delta factors obtained by analyzing the d4pdf dataset with the observed precipitation present climate precipitation projections in different climate scenarios were predicted as shown in fig 5 c based on the average daily accumulation for all climate scenarios the climate projections describe a range of changes in mean annual precipitation compared to historical observed data from 5 5 to 4 9 for 2 k scenarios and from 9 6 to 6 9 for 4 k scenarios similar to the delta change factors a significant change in the amount of projected precipitation occurs in the wet season especially in july and august the average pattern of the 2 k climate scenario 2k avr results in a slight increase 0 35 increase in mean annual precipitation compared to the observation present climate and a slight reduction 0 64 reduction resulted in an average pattern of the 4 k climate scenario 4k avr 5 1 2 actual evapotranspiration projections fig 6 a shows the mean monthly aet for various climate scenarios obtained from the gcm d4pdf prediction the estimated amount of water transferred to the atmosphere tends to increase as the temperature increases the monthly delta changes factor obtained by analyzing the gcm data set for 2 k scenarios is ranged from 0 91 to 1 10 for 4 k scenarios is ranged from 0 91 to 1 15 by using the delta factors obtained by analyzing the d4pdf dataset fig 6a with the references aet the aet projection in different climate scenarios was predicted as shown in fig 6 b under the climate projections the range of increase in mean annual aet compared to the reference present climate varies from 0 57 to 3 78 for 2 k scenarios and from 4 50 to 7 94 for 4 k scenarios all climate scenarios show the highest amount of aet during april and may in which this period has a high temperature with a moderate precipitation amount the average pattern of the 2 k climate scenario 2k avr results in a 2 8 average daily value 0 57 increase from the present climate and a 2 95 5 96 increase resulted in an average pattern of 4 k climate scenario 4k avr according to the projected aet increasing the temperature results in an increase in the potential of water transferred to the atmosphere leading to fewer water resources available in the basin 5 2 climate change and hydropower development impact on river flow river flow downstream of the nn1 reservoir was used to analyze the impacts of climate change and hydropower development on annual and seasonal flow changes a comparison of the annual and seasonal flows for all scenarios is summarized in table 5 5 2 1 climate change impact on natural condition flow a simulation without dams was conducted to assess the impact of climate change on river flow without the impact of dam operation fig 7 shows a comparison of the average monthly flows in various climate scenarios a comparison between different climate scenarios shows that the change in average annual flow compared to the present climate scenario nd ps ranges from 12 5 to 3 3 for 2 k scenarios and from 21 7 to 3 5 for 4 k scenarios with a significant difference in magnitude in the wet season july august and september similar to the projection of precipitation the average of 2 k 2k avr and 4 k 4k avr climate scenarios showed a decreasing trend in the annual river flow of 4 4 and 8 1 respectively 5 2 2 climate change impact on nam song water diversion to predict the amount of water diversion in different climate scenarios we adopted the ratio between the simulated flow in the present climate condition and the discharge of the diversion record and then applied the ratio with the simulated river discharge for each climate scenario the diverted water discharge is limited to the maximum diversion capacity fig 8 a presents the change in mean monthly water availability at the diversion headwork nam song river in different climate scenarios in which the mean annual flow varies from 7 5 to 6 3 for 2 k scenarios and from 15 7 to 8 1 for 4 k scenarios compared with present climate scenarios fig 8 b presents the change in mean monthly water diversion from the nam song at diversion headwork to the nn1 reservoir in different climate scenarios where the mean annual diversion discharge varied from 4 5 to 2 2 for 2 k scenarios and from 9 6 to 6 1 for 4 k scenarios compared with the present climate scenarios according to the simulation results climate change has a less significant effect on the total amount of water diversion from the nam song river to the nn1 reservoir compared to the change in water availability at the diversion headwork inflow of the nam song dam for example in the case of the 4k mi climate scenario the greatest reduction of river flow the reduction of water transfer to the nn1 reservoir is only a 1 5 reduction from the nn1 reservoir total inflow compared to the present climate scenario with ed conditions ed ps 5 2 3 climate change impact on river flow with existing dam condition fig 9 a describes the impact of climate change on the inflow of the nn1 reservoir with the ed conditions the change in the annual inflow ranges from 8 3 to 5 9 for 2 k scenarios and from 16 7 to 6 5 for 4 k scenarios compared to the present climate scenario ed ps to assess the combined effect of climate change and dam development the degree of change in the river flow was compared with the natural flow condition nd ps and a range of change in the mean annual inflow from 0 3 to 28 2 was found a significant change in seasonal flow inflow of nn1 due to upstream dam development in different climate scenarios compared with natural flow conditions nd ps varies from 74 1 to 117 3 in the dry season and 18 to 8 2 in the wet season a significant alteration in the seasonal inflow of nn1 is mainly due to the regulation of a large storage dam such as nn2 with an effective storage capacity of 2617 mcm fig 9 b describes the impact of climate change on the regulated flow of the nn1 reservoir with inflow from the existing upstream dam condition the change in the annual regulated flow downstream of the nn1 reservoir for different climate scenarios ranged from 8 7 to 5 7 for 2 k scenarios and from 15 8 to 5 8 for 4 k scenarios compared to the present climate scenario ed ps the effect of the nn1 reservoir regulation with a large effective storage of 4714 mcm was assessed by comparing the seasonal flow change between the predicted inflow fig 9a and regulated flow fig 9b for each climate condition the simulation result shows a 49 0 22 9 reduction in the wet season and a 44 2 56 1 increase in the dry season 5 2 4 climate change impact on river flow with future dam condition fig 10 a shows the impact of climate change on the inflow of the nn1 reservoir with the regulated flow from the future upstream dam conditions ns dv nl nn2 and nn3 the change in the annual inflow of the nn1 reservoir for different climate scenarios ranged from 8 0 to 5 6 for 2 k scenarios and from 16 2 to 6 3 for 4 k scenarios compared with the present climate scenario fd ps the inflow of the nn1 reservoir becomes more stable a slight decrease in seasonal variation due to an increase in the regulated storage of the upstream dams an additional power station nn3 with an effective storage of 1070 mcm was considered in this simulation to assess the impact of nn3 regulation on the inflow of nn1 the simulated inflow for fd development conditions fig 10a was compared with the ed condition fig 9a for each climate scenario the results show that there is a slight reduction of 0 2 2 6 in the wet season inflow and a slight increase of 2 4 5 3 in the dry season inflow of the nn1 reservoir fig 10 b shows the impact of climate change on the regulated flow of the nn1 reservoir downstream with fd conditions the change in the annual river flow downstream of the nn1 reservoir for different climate scenarios ranged from 8 4 to 5 4 for 2 k scenarios and from 15 5 to 5 6 for 4 k scenarios compared with the present climate scenario fd ps the primary change in seasonal river flow due to dam development in different climate scenarios compared with natural flow conditions nd ps downstream of the nn1 reservoir varied from 48 8 to 23 1 in the wet season and 196 0 to 217 8 in the dry season to assess the impact of the nn3 operation on the regulated flow of nn1 the regulated flow under the fd condition fig 10b is compared to the river flow under the ed condition fig 9b for each climate scenario the results show that there is no primary change in the regulated flow from the nn1 reservoir to the downstream because the regulated potential of nn3 effective storage of 1070 mcm is approximately only 9 0 range from 8 2 10 4 of the mean predicted total inflow of nn1 for different climate scenarios with fd conditions this agrees with meema et al 2020 that major large scale hydropower dams have already been developed which can regulate most river flows in the basin by comparing the individual effects of climate change and dam development with the natural flow condition nd ps the changing climate has a primary effect in terms of the total amount of water availability mean annual river flow due to the combined effect of precipitation change and aet increase a significant effect occurs during the wet season due to a change in the magnitude of precipitation leading to a change in river flow only a slight change in seasonal flow driven by climate change was observed in this study dam development in the basin has a primary effect in terms of seasonal flow variation due to regulation using storage furthermore not only a primary change in seasonal flow but dam development with a river diversion type from another catchment results in increasing of mean annual river flow as well the simulation results demonstrate that the large scale dam reservoir which can control a large volume of water in the basin plays an important role in water resource management 5 3 link between projected precipitation evaporation inflow and regulated flow the model includes soil and bedrock aquifers that respond to the natural storage of the basin during the dry season the amount of precipitation is lower than that of aet and the storage is the primary contributor to the basin although some effective rainfall occurs precipitation aet during the beginning of the wet season may and june most rainwater infiltrates into the aquifers therefore the hydrograph of river flow fig 7 shows a minor difference during these periods the highest amount of precipitation occurs in july and august and effective rainfall is sufficient to become surface flow the magnitude of river flow is dependent on the amount of projected precipitation resulting in a primary difference in the river flow hydrograph as shown in fig 7 in september and october the storages become fully filled from the previous months and most effective rainwater becomes surface runoff a combination of groundwater and surface flow results in a significantly higher difference in river flow compared to precipitation the major difference in regulated flow among the scenarios was due to the spillage water in this study we assumed that the operation follows the present operation therefore during the dry season including the beginning of wet seasons such as june and july the amount of reservoir inflow can be controlled by the reservoir storage current storage st maximum storage smax therefore the comparison of regulated flow for various scenarios is quite similar as shown in figs 9 and 10 during the mid to late wet seasons august to october significant spilling occurs st smax when river discharge has an increasing trend leading to a significant difference in regulated flow during this period as shown in figs 9 and 10 although a larger difference in precipitation was observed in july and august the primary difference in regulated flow from nn1 was found in august to october due to the storage capacity regulated capacity of the reservoirs in this study the hydrological residence time hrt of the nn1 nn2 and nn3 reservoirs for the present climate scenarios with fd condition are 0 39 0 46 and 0 41 year respectively hrt year effective storage capacity mcm inflow mcm year conversely when the hrt decreases the regulated hydrograph is closer to the inflow hydrograph 5 4 climate change impact on reservoir water level and water spillage fig 11 a presents a comparison of the mean monthly water level of the nn1 reservoir in different climate scenarios with ed conditions a change of mean water level for different climate scenarios compared with present climate scenarios ed ps is varied from 0 63 to 0 12 m for 2 k scenarios and from 2 86 to 0 41 m for 4 k scenarios for the average climate scenarios such as 2k avr and 4k avr the reduction in mean reservoir water level is 0 12 and 0 34 m respectively fig 11 b presents a comparison of the mean monthly water level of the nn1 reservoir in different climate scenarios with fd conditions the tendency of the mean monthly reservoir water level is quite similar to that of the ed condition fig 11a but the trend is slightly increased by using the same operation pattern more stable inflow increase in the dry season flow and decrease in the wet season due to an increase in the regulation capacity of the upstream dam results in slightly higher water levels in the reservoir resulting in a 0 18 0 36 m increase in mean reservoir water level compared with the ed condition for each climate scenario table 6 summaries the mean annual reservoir water and the total amount of water spillage from the nn1 reservoir in different simulation scenarios the mean annual amount of water spillage for all simulation scenarios is ranged from 0 to 921 6 mcm for each dam development condition the mean annual water spillage trends to increase when the mean reservoir water level increases to assess the effect of dam development on water spills from the nn1 reservoir the amount of water spillage for each climate scenario between the ed and fd conditions was compared it was revealed that although all climate scenarios in fd result in an increase in mean water level compared with ed some climate scenarios result in a reduction of a water spill this demonstrated that the amount of water spillage is not only a function of the water level but also other factors for example in the case 4k mr although the mean water level in fd has a 0 2 m higher than ed the water spillage is reduced by 42 0 because the water level in fd is generally higher than ed during the period without spills spills usually occur in september and october and the regulated flow from the upstream in the fd condition is more appropriate for power generation most water is used to generate power through the turbines leading to less water spillage through the spillway the water level of the nn1 reservoir seems to have less fluctuation when there are more reservoirs upstream because of its regulated flow which tends to increase the nn1 inflow in the dry season and decrease in the wet season the water spill is the amount of water released through the spillway without generating electricity when the current reservoir storage exceeds the maximum storage thus to use water effectively the operation of the reservoir should be considered to avoid the water spillage 5 5 climate change impact on hydropower production the hydrologic impact on hydropower production was analyzed considering the overall effect on climate change and upstream dam development the simulation results of the mean annual energy production for different simulation scenarios are listed in table 7 fig 12 a presents a comparison of the mean monthly energy product of the nn1 power station in different climate scenarios with the ed development conditions under projected climate scenarios the difference in mean annual energy production compared to the present climate ed ps varies from 8 4 to 1 9 for 2 k scenarios and from 19 5 to 2 8 for 4 k scenarios its reduction in energy production due to a reduction in inflow to the reservoir and a decrease in reservoir water level leading to generated hydraulic head reduction results in decreased energy production fig 12 b illustrates a comparison of the mean monthly energy product of the nn1 power station in different climate scenarios with the fd development conditions the change in mean annual energy production from the present climate fd ps for different projected climate scenarios is quite similar to a change in the ed development conditions to demonstrate the effect of upstream cascade dam development on energy production of the nn1 power station the mean monthly energy between the existing fig 12a and future fig 12b dam development conditions were compared for each climate scenario under the fd development level the annual energy production of the nn1 power station has a slightly increasing trend due to more upstream reservoirs in operation the construction of upstream cascade dams improves the stabilization between the wet and dry seasons of inflow to the nn1 reservoir leading to an improvement in the reservoir water level and thus increasing the potential for power generation and total energy production however a general trend 2k avr and 4k avr seems to indicate a reduction in the annual energy product when the projected temperature is increased 5 6 climate change impact on water loss from the reservoir the mean monthly evaporation rate from the water body was placed at the reservoirs to account for the net amount of water loss due to evaporation from the water surface of the reservoirs the differences in water loss from the nn1 reservoir for the different simulation scenarios are summarized in table 8 fig 13 a presents a comparison of the mean monthly amount of water loss from the nn1 reservoir in different climate scenarios with the ed development conditions the amount of water loss due to evaporation in different climate scenarios varies from 9 2 to 13 4 for 2 k scenarios and from 24 5 to 35 6 for 4 k scenarios compared to the present climate with the ed development stage ed ps although the evaporation loss rates in november and december were significantly lower than those in march and april as shown in fig 13c the net amount of water loss was quite similar as shown in fig 13a the operation pattern tries to maintain the water in the reservoir at a high level at the end of the rainy season and the beginning of the dry season leading to an increase in free water surface area which results in a high amount of water loss fig 13 b presents a comparison of the mean monthly amount of water loss from the nn1 reservoir in different climate scenarios with the fd development conditions the tendency of water loss from the reservoir in different climate scenarios compared to the present climate fd ps is quite similar to the ed development conditions by comparing the simulation results under different climate scenarios between the fd condition fig 13b and the ed condition fig 13a to assess the impact of fd development on the projected amount of water loss from the nn1 reservoir there is a slight increase in actual water loss as the water level increases the reservoir water surface area increases which results in an additional amount of water loss due to evaporation the amount of water loss from the reservoir in the present ed ps is approximately 2 4 of the total inflow of the nn1 reservoir however under the projected climate scenarios the amount of water loss from the nn1 reservoir due to evaporation will increase to approximately 2 7 and 3 2 of the present mean annual inflow for the 2 k and 4 k temperature increase scenarios respectively 2k avr and 4k avr assume that the total amount of water loss due to evaporation can be used to utilize the hydropower an approximately 3 6 and 9 4 gw h year of additional energy production for the nn1 power station will be lost when the temperature increases by 2 k and 4 k respectively 2k avr and 4k avr 5 7 reservoir operation strategy to cope with climate change as hydropower production is strongly related to inflow the power generation for the nn1 power station could vary significantly owing to large variations in inflow projections to mitigate variability implementing strategies such as changing the existing operation is necessary fig 14 shows the implementation of reservoir operation of the nn1 reservoir for the increasing trend of inflow for example the 4k ha scenario fig 14 a shows the implementation by dropping the level of the nn1 rule curve to avoid a spill by decreasing the rule curve to a lower level the results show that water spills tend to decrease and energy production tends to increase although decreasing the level of the rule curve over 2 5 m results in a higher reduction of the water spill the head is reduced resulting in less power output the maximum increase in energy output has resulted when dropping the rule curve by 2 5 m with a 1 7 increase in energy production compared to the existing rule curve dropping 0 m fig 14 b shows the implementation by increasing the installed power capacity it is possible that in terms of the future inflow trend has increased stakeholders can consider installing more capacity to utilize additional water to generate more power engineering design and construction processes are also required furthermore by increasing the power capacity the implementation cost should be considered against the benefit of an increase in energy production by increasing the capacity with the existing rule curve the results show that water spills tend to decrease and energy production tends to increase although the water spillage is decreased when the capacity is increased above 10 it results in less energy output because a large amount of water is discharged downstream which results in a reduction in the water level in the reservoir reduction head leading to less power generation the maximum increase in energy output was observed when the capacity was increased by 10 with a 3 8 increase in energy production compared to the existing capacity fig 15 shows the implementation of reservoir operation of the nn1 reservoir by changing the rule curve for the decreasing trend of inflow for example the fd 4k mi scenario fig 15 a shows the shifting elevation of the nn1 rule curve at different levels fig 15 b shows the implementation of the nn1 reservoir by shifting the rule curve to a higher level by shifting the rule curve as shown in fig 15a a higher hydraulic head is provided because higher reservoir water levels result in increased energy production as a result of the higher water level the water spillage tended to increase although the water level in the reservoir is increased when shifting the rule curve with an average shift elevation higher than 2 5 m the energy output tends to decrease because of the higher water spill the maximum increase in energy output has resulted when shifting the rule curve of the nn1 reservoir by 2 5 m on average with a 5 4 increase in energy production compared to the rule curve 6 conclusion a change in long term river flow projection covers a wide range dominated mainly by the difference in precipitation projections the mean climate projections of the 2 k and 4 k scenarios 2k avr and 4k avr show a slight decrease in the mean annual river flow although climate change has a primary effect on river flow in total annual amount the impact on seasonal flow change is quite low compared to the effect of dam development the effect of dam development shows a significant reduction in seasonal flow variation downstream of the nn1 reservoir regulated flow in all climate scenarios compared to the natural flow condition nd at the fd stage all climate scenarios show a distinct trend of change in seasonal flow compared to the ed stage with a slight increase in the dry season and a slight decrease in the wet season due to an additional regulated storage of the under construction dam nn3 the estimation of energy production of the nn1 power station under climate projections shows a large variation in the mean annual energy output due to the uncertainty of river flow projections in different climate scenarios at the fd stage the annual energy production has a slightly increasing trend compared to the ed development stage because of the regulated flow from the storage of the upstream cascade dam with an increase in temperature projections the nnbr seems to face a decreasing trend in future precipitation a combination of precipitation reduction and high temperatures resulted in a reduction in river flow and hydropower production without any implementation the existing operation will lead to a loss in the annual energy production thus adaptive implementations are necessary to mitigate the impact of climate change on long term hydropower generation the rule curve needs to be effectively managed to optimize hydropower production while other related purposes such as downstream flood risk water demand deficit ecosystems and social vulnerability are minimized based on our approach for this study there are some limitations first by using the delta method to project climate variables there is a lack of change in the variability and spatial patterns of climate a gcm downscale including a bias correction process might be required to access the spatial distribution and variability of the projected climate second this study assumed that the hydrologic variables that have an influence on river flow projection including basin land cover do not change in future studies land use change and upstream water use e g for irrigation should be considered the operation of a large scale dam with a large storage capacity can play a primary role in water resource management in the river basin to improve the efficiency of reservoir operation the consideration of forecast information should be carried out however the hydrological forecast has significant uncertainties and it is difficult to predict future conditions perfectly nohara et al 2016 applied the ensemble prediction technique to support preliminary operation of the reservoir the information including the possible conditions and the uncertainty of prediction can be important for more effective decision strategy for the reservoir real time operation author statement thatkiat meema conceptualization methodology analysis software visualization
