seawater blettler et al 2018 faure et al 2015 meijer et al 2021 microplastics are found in freshwaters such as rivers lakes and lagoons some of which could be significant pathways and emissions of

al 2018 wang et al 2021a rangel alvarado et al 2019 there is a convergence of approaches suggesting that the physicochemical transformation of microplastics is key to understanding their environmental impacts gigault et al 2021 alimi et al 2022 factors such as particle size shape surface properties and coatings are amongst those uncertainties identified as knowledge gaps waldschläger and schüttrumpf 2019 alimi et al 2022 wang et al 2021b francalanci et al 2021 fazey and ryan 2016 for instance organics inorganics and biological coatings in the environment can alter the transportation fate of microplastics fazey and ryan 2016 kowalski et al 2016 li et al 2019 microplastics with given physicochemical properties when entering the surroundings will not have identical characteristics while transported in water or at air water interfaces gigault et al 2021 kowalski et al 2016 li et al 2019 kukulka et al 2012 thereby it is essential to quantify such processes dynamically yet more work needs to be done in real time wang et al 2021b using a newly developed nano digital inline holographic microscope nano dihm four dimensional 3d time tracking is feasible we can observe in situ

most studies have focused on the silicone materials rather than the environmental aspects rezaei et al 2013 gustavsson et al 2000 fernando and gubanski 2010 muthukumar et al 2011 in this work we performed in situ and real time physicochemical nano microplastic research namely coatings and sedimentation processes in water using nano dihm integrated physicochemical experiments and modelling research were conducted to explore the transport and fate of two different size categories of plastics and alternative plastic particles including i 10 to 700 µm microplastics hereafter and ii 1 to 5 mm pellets hereafter the settling floating processes of polyethylene pe polypropylene pp polystyrene ps polyethylene terephthalate pet polyurethane pur polyvinyl chloride pvc and two types of silicone rubbers with and without coatings in freshwater and seawater were studied semi empirical equations for the sedimentation of studied microplastics were developed and integrated into campsim 3d numerical model created by the national research council canada pilechi et al 2022 the transport of plastics was simulated and compared in the lower saint john river estuary in eastern canada to assess how the physicochemical properties of plastics can relate to their environmental impact in real world conditions we discussed the potential implications of the work on water research namely the identification of nano microplastic hotspots for improved plastics waste remediation 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample preparation and measurements the plastics studied here were chosen based on their market size and presence in the aquatic environment van melkebeke et al 2020 research and markets 2021 six groups of microplastics and plastic pellets with different densities including pe pp ps pet pur and pvc were studied two types of silicone silicone1 and silicone2 were examined as plastic alternatives artificial seawater ph 6 and ph 8 solutions were prepared for different scenarios a digital calliper and a nano dihm measured the particle size and shape the particle density was determined by a modified titration method waldschläger and schüttrumpf 2019 iso 1183 1 2019 khatmullina and isachenko 2017 see notes s1 s4 for details 2 2 nano dihm for micro nanoplastic coating study nano sized plastic particles 1 µm from selected groups were examined by a nano dihm and a high resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy hr s tem to explore the capability of nano dihm in studying the transformation and transport of nanoplastics pe pp ps and pur nanoplastics were synthesized in laboratory by a modified protocol note s5 ganguly and ariya 2019 magnetite oleic acid and phytoplankton were used as representatives of inorganic organic and biological coatings selected nano microplastics were mixed thoroughly with suspensions of coating materials for 24 h the mixtures of coated nano microplastics were deposited on optical slides and analysed by a nano dihm in nano dihm a spherical wave from a visible laser 405 nm here was emitted and passed through a pinhole hall et al 2022 4deep inwater imaging 2018 the incident light illuminated the analyte and interacted with the scattered light forming a magnified interference pattern on a screen fig 1 a pal et al 2021 garcia sucerquia et al 2006 the recorded interference pattern or the hologram was then numerically reconstructed to extract 3d information of the samples this study used a 4deep desktop dihm at 16 fps in stationary and dynamic modes the laser to sample and sample to camera distances were adjusted occasionally for optimal illumination a 4deep octopus software was used for reconstructions 4deep inwater imaging 2018 2 3 the sedimentation of microplastics 10 to 700 µm sedimentation experiments for microplastics were performed in an optical glass cuvette 12 5 mm in width 102 5 mm in length and 45 0 mm in height four scenarios were studied including deionized water artificial seawater ph 6 and ph 8 solutions the settling processes of pet pur and pvc microplastic sinkers were recorded by a nano dihm fig 1b particle size shape and trajectory were acquired by 4deep octopus software 4deep inwater imaging 2018 the injection of a suspension of nano sized polystyrene latex psl was followed to validate nano dihm for dynamic tracking of nanoplastics 2 4 the gradual descent of microplastics only some of the microplastic sinkers sedimented immediately after being released instead they kept floating on water surface for several days before starting to settle we called this observation gradual descent to further explore such a process we measured the daily and long term 60 days gradual descent of microplastics note s6 and fig s1 semi empirical equations for the gradual descent were developed 2 5 the settling floating velocity of pellets 1 to 5 mm sedimentation experiments for pe pp ps pet pur pvc and silicone pellets with and without oleic acid coatings were performed in a cylindrical glass chamber fig 1c depending on different scenarios the chamber was filled with deionized water or artificial seawater the experiments were recorded by a nikon coolpix 4500 digital camera the settling velocity was measured for the sinkers pet ps pur pvc and silicone1 the floating velocity was determined for the floaters pe pp and silicone2 see note s7 for more information corey shape factor csf equivalent spherical diameter esd unbounded velocity w particle reynolds number re dimensionless particle size d and the wall effect on the sedimentation velocity of studied microplastics and pellets were calculated and compared note s8 2 6 numerical modelling the modelling study was performed using campsim 3d a numerical framework developed at the national research council canada for simulating the fate and transport of microplastics in rivers lakes estuaries coastal waters and oceans pilechi et al 2022 campsim 3d was based on a three dimensional particle tracking model ptm coupled with a telemac 3d hydrodynamic modelling system hervouet 2007 the ptm incorporated the effect of particle characteristics like shape size and density on their movement through sedimentation at each time step selected hydrodynamic parameters of the ambient environment like the velocity field and vertical elevations were computed details are provided in note s9 to assess the impact of settling floating velocity on the distribution and environmental impact of plastics in real world conditions the modified model was applied to simulate the transport of studied microplastics and pellets in a 75 km long reach of the lower saint john river extending from evandale to the bay of fundy fig s2 the particles were monitored for five days corresponding to the minimum period after which no significant change was seen in the number of particles in zone 1 a representative trapping area of plastic pollution within the saint john river system and zone 2 the river mouth fig s2 the influence of the plastic sedimentation on the model prediction was assessed by comparing the ratio of the number of plastic particles n p accumulated in zone 1 and zone 2 to the total number of particles n p total 2 7 materials and supplies pet pp and ps pellets pe microplastics psl suspension zncl2 magnetite hcl solution naoh solution and oleic acid were from sigma aldrich thf was from thermo fisher scientific pe pellets were from alfa aesar pur pellets and microplastics were from tpuco silicone2 was from zhongshan morning tips technology pvc pellets were cut off from pvc mats silicone1 pellets were cut off from silicone drink coasters pp and pvc microplastics were from scientific polymer products pet and ps microplastics were from goodfellow and tosoh artificial sea salt was from instant ocean phytoplankton was from seachem ethanol was from greenfield global 3 results and discussion we explored the usage of nano dihm in two physicochemical micro nanoplastic research in water coatings section 3 1 and sedimentation section 3 2 we also provided probability functions of the gradual descent of selected microplastics the settling floating rate of studied pellets in different water conditions with and without coatings was compared section 3 3 the influence of particle sedimentation on modelling predictions as a standard tool for identifying accumulation zone and assessing the environmental impact of plastic pollution in water systems was discussed by comparing simulations for the plastic transport in the saint john river estuary section 3 4 3 1 nano dihm for micro nanoplastic coating studies there is an ambiguity in defining micro and nanoplastics in several studies the upper size limit of microplastics is 5 mm cai et al 2018 kaiser et al 2019 here we followed the internationally accepted metric units microplastics referred to plastics smaller than 1 mm and nano sized plastics smaller than 1 µm browne et al 2011 wang et al 2021a browne et al 2010 as the physicochemical characteristics of plastics will likely not remain the same when transported in dynamic matrices such as water the usage of metric units allows for less confusing terminologies it facilitates the data sharing system that will advance the field 3 1 1 the capability of nano dihm for nanoplastic detection shown in fig 2 is a comparison of hr s tem images and nano dihm reconstructions intensity and phase of ps and pur nanoplastics in water hr s tem results confirmed the particle size and shape obtained by nano dihm we herein showed that nano dihm could detect nanoplastics and characterize the particle properties in water nano dihm for nanoplastic coatings and dynamic processes were further explored and discussed in sections 3 1 2 and 3 2 1 nanoplastics have become an emerging threat to the environment and human health mitrano et al 2021 the high surface to volume ratio allows nanoplastics to undergo various transformations and be adsorbed by other anthropogenic or natural entities affecting their toxicity to aquatic organisms mitrano et al 2021 shen et al 2019 current nanoplastic research is limited due to methodological and technological barriers future advances in nano dihm techniques may allow diverse physicochemical and dynamic studies of nanoplastics in different environmental matrices hall et al 2022 3 1 2 organic inorganic and biological coatings on micro nanoplastics fig 3 depicts the nano dihm intensity and phase reconstructions of micro nanoplastics coated by various inorganic organic and biological materials in water different coatings produced different intensity phase images and crosscut profiles the intensity and phase crosscuts of the pe microplastic particle in deionized water fig 3a b exhibited lower spikes and variations than the one in artificial seawater fig 3c d this observation was consistent with the different chemical compositions of the two matrices as artificial seawater contained a higher amount of minerals which can give more signals magnetite coatings on the pet led to medium intense shoulder peaks fig 3e f meanwhile the magnetite nanoparticles scattered more light than other studied coatings indicated by the raised background noise fig 3e f phytoplankton on the pvc created signature intensity and phase signals fig 3g h extra examples are provided in fig s3 the same material can form distinct coating patterns depending on the particle size the organic coating led to regional signal spikes on the microplastic profiles whereas it formed layers of rings around the core of the pp nanoplastic particle displayed in fig 3i j are oleic acid droplets adsorbed a pp microplastic particles while fig 3k l show a nano sized pp particle entirely coated by oleic acid see fig s4 for more nanoplastic examples in the natural surroundings the physicochemical properties of micro nanoplastics including coatings can be affected by various ageing processes kokalj et al 2019 luo et al 2022 for instance physical abrasion can reduce the particle size uv radiation can cause surface oxidation and biodegradation can alter the plastic functional groups and lead to oligomeric fragmentations luo et al 2022 hüffer et al 2018 such changes could influence the polarity surface charge and hydrophobicity of micro nanoplastics affecting their adsorption activities and surface properties luo et al 2022 hüffer et al 2018 wu et al 2020 further long term studies on heterogeneous micro nanoplastics and coated plastic particles are recommended in future research micro nanoplastics can interact with many other particles like sediments minerals natural organic matters and microorganisms in natural water li et al 2019 lagarde et al 2016 oriekhova and stoll 2018 kaiser et al 2017 depending on the types of microplastics they can either adsorb on suspended particles and co settle together or keep floating on the water surface due to the high repulsive energy between the plastics and natural particles li et al 2019 lagarde et al 2016 song et al 2017 for instance some microorganisms can increase the average density of the plastic organism bodies leading to advanced sedimentation of plastic debris in water fazey and ryan 2016 kaiser et al 2017 ye and andrady 1991 woodall et al 2014 such processes can affect the transport and accumulation of micro nanoplastics this work provided a new approach to investigating the diverse coating processes of micro nanoplastics in complex environmental matrices 3 2 in situ and real time sedimentation of micro nanoplastics by nano dihm nano dihm can follow the in situ and real time 4d 3d time movements of both micro and nanoplastics videos 1 and 2 3 2 1 nano dihm for nanoplastic dynamic tracking a composite image of a series of consecutive intensity reconstructions exhibits the dynamics of 200 nm psl spheres in water fig 4 a a video is provided to demonstrate the real time movement of the nanoplastics video 1 the transport and retention of nanoplastics highly depend on hydrodynamics and water chemistry for instance a high flow rate and low salinity would increase the mobility of nanoplastics ling et al 2022 the psl used here was in a suspension with surfactants as the suspension was injected into water the movement of psl was mainly controlled by the inertia of the injection brownian motion otherwise is expected to dominant the movement if there were no surfactant and flow perturbation bain 2022 the movements of nanoplastics are expected to change when other materials exist for example the presence of ca2 can accelerate the aggregation of nanoplastics whereas humic acid ca2 complexation could stabilize nanoplastic particles in water singh et al 2019 3 2 2 the sedimentation of microplastics depicted in fig 4b is the sedimentation of a single pet microplastic particle in water showing the transformation of the particle during its settling the observed lateral rotation and non rectilinear motion of the particle agreed with the calculated settling reynolds number re suggesting a transitional hydraulic regime wang et al 2021b the sedimentation velocity of pet pur and pvc was measured whereas pe pp and ps floated on the water surface throughout the experiment fig s5 studied microplastics had irregular shapes with esd from 14 to 694 µm the microplastics were affected by the wall effect by 2 under our experimental conditions the wall effect did not significantly impact the results given that the blockage ratio measured as the ratio between the dimensions of the particle and the chamber was relatively low samantaray et al 2017 additionally since the wall effect minimizes at the chamber centre the particles were released as close to the chamber s central line as possible jing et al 2019 the settling rate as a function of particle size was tabulated in table s1 the settling velocity of the same category of microplastics in deionized water ph 6 and ph 8 solutions was not statistically distinct indicating that acidity alone within the studied ph range was not a critical factor in altering the sedimentation rate fig s6 in artificial seawater the presence of inorganic ions affected the microplastics with the lowest density the most in agreement with the observation of the studied pellets section 3 3 potential explanations of such observations are discussed in note s10 a linear relation was observed between the settling velocity and particle size for all studied microplastics fig s6 results suggested that particle shape within the studied range had minor effects on their settling velocity instead the particle size was more critical and positively correlated with the settling rate the sedimentation of microplastics with oleic acid coating was attempted however the microplastic sinkers became floating on the water surface due to the organic layer after an amount of time the coated microplastics attached to the cuvette wall and stopped moving this observation confirmed the impact of coatings on the transport of microplastics in aquatic systems ye and andrady 1991 woodall et al 2014 3 2 3 the gradual descent of microplastics in water effects of ions and ph although the microplastic floaters i e pe pp and ps aggregated due to high hydrophobic attraction the overwhelming buoyancy of water made them float on the water surface throughout the experiment li et al 2019 cai et al 2018 some microplastic sinkers i e pet pur and pvc did not settle immediately they kept floating for several days before starting to sediment we called this observation gradual descent we followed the daily and 60 day gradual descent of the microplastics fig s7 log logistic probability functions were developed to describe the relation between the level of gradual descent of different types of microplastics under different environmental conditions table s2 depending on the physicochemical properties of the microplastics the presence of inorganic ions may either speed up or slow down the long term gradual descent of the microplastics a negative relation between the particle size and the duration of gradual descent was observed fig s7 and table s3 although the density of pet was the largest amongst the three types of sinkers the duration of its gradual descent was the longest yet the lightest pur had the shortest period of gradual descent this observation might be explained by the prevailing surface tension over the gravity of pet bearing the smallest particle size as compared with pur park et al 2019 berthier and brakke 2012 detailed discussions can be found in note s11 3 3 the sedimentation of plastic pellets and silicone rubbers 1 to 5 mm the settling floating velocity of studied pellets and the effect of salts and organic coatings are depicted in table s4 the equivalent spherical diameter esd was applied for further comparison as studied pellets had diverse shapes from the sphere olivary ellipsoid and hemisphere to cylinder and cubic measured particle densities were smaller than theoretical values plausibly due to entrapped air bubbles especially for pe and pp the wall effect suppressed the sedimentation velocity of studied pellets by 4 to 6 flow separation caused secondary movements to waked vortices around the particles with irregular shapes and unsmooth surfaces implying increased drag force thus decreased settling floating velocity of studied pellets wang et al 2021b komar and reimers 1978 stringham et al 1969 the settling reynolds number of all studied pellets was between 1 and 103 it was consistent with the experimental observations where lateral rotation oscillation and occasionally non rectilinear motion trajectories were noticed during the particle sedimentation wang et al 2021b 3 3 1 the settling floating velocity in deionized water and artificial seawater as illustrated in table s4 the sinkers pet pur ps pvc and silicone1 were denser than water and sank to the water bottom the floaters included pe pp and silicone2 density alone should not be used to classify sinkers and floaters apart from buoyancy other vertical forces can also counterbalance gravity berthier and brakke 2012 liu et al 2013 factors like particle geometry size surface properties and hydraulic conditions should be considered berthier and brakke 2012 ryan 2015 density was used as the criterion here as the pellets had reasonable size 1 to 5 mm with irregular but mostly near spheric or cubic shapes fig s8a c plot the floating velocity of pe pp and silicone2 pellets in deionized water artificial seawater and deionized water with oleic acid coating the t test indicated that the three scenarios were statistically distinct where pe had the most considerable change in floating velocity followed by silicone2 and pp this observation could be explained by the differences in the relative density between the particle and the medium the floating velocity of studied pp pellets had the most significant standard deviations in all scenarios plausibly due to the lowest particle uniformity in shape and size although the particle shape and chemical composition of pp and silicone2 were different they had similar floating velocities likely due to their similar size and density wang et al 2021b amongst the sinkers ps exhibited the most significant settling velocity variation followed by pur pet silicone1 and pvc fig s8d h it could be explained by the lowest particle medium density difference of ps amongst the sinkers pur and pvc pellets shared similar density and particle size and similar settling velocity table s4 although they had different shapes surface roughness and distinct chemical compositions the increase in water density reduced the settling velocity of the sinkers by 13 and enhanced the floating rate of the floaters by 9 under the experimental condition due to their relatively low density plastic particles are more sensitive to the surroundings than dense sediments making the accurate prediction of their transportation and fate in water challenging cai et al 2018 kumar et al 2010 gewert et al 2015 lu et al 2018 3 3 2 the effect of organic coating oleic acid coating reduced the settling velocity of the sinkers by 9 and changed the floating rate of floaters by 5 since the densities of studied settling plastics from 1056 to 1353 kg m3 were higher than oleic acid 895 kg m³ the coating reduced the overall density of the plastic coating body with respective to the plastic particle itself which may lead to a decrease in settling velocity for the floaters the density of pe 920 kg m3 was larger than oleic acid thus the coating reduced the overall plastic coating body s density and led to a higher floating velocity the density of pp 866 kg m3 was lower than 895 kg m³ thereby a decreased floating rate was expected for silicone2 the floating rate of the coated pellet was higher than expected plausibly due to air entrapment between the coarse particle surface and the oleic acid layer however further research is recommended to accurately evaluate this hypothesis this observation hinted that plastic pellets might suspend for a longer time in water with organic coatings and travel longer distances oleic acid coating also caused the attachment of particles to the chamber wall during their sedimentation and hampered the falling rising motions it also caused particle aggregation where the sedimentation of the aggregates was faster than single particles this observation indicated that coatings might change the mobility and distribution of plastics in water consequently altering the transportation pathways and the location of accumulation 3 3 3 the settling floating of silicone rubbers the sedimentation of the industrial silicone silicone2 was remarkably different from the ones used for cookware silicone1 as shown in table s4 silicone2 was lighter than water and floated and silicone1 was denser and sank silicone1 was distinct from other plastic pellets for its air retaining property silicone1 had air bubbles firmly attached to the particle underwater over the entire experiment period such a phenomenon was caused by the attraction between the superhydrophobic surfaces and air bubbles relating to the particle chemical composition and 3d topography sonoyama and iguchi 2002 kibar et al 2013 chen et al 2015 the actual sedimentation velocity without bubbles of silicone1 speculatively is higher than the measured values silicone has been widely used as a plastic substitute in industries with expanding applications shit and shah 2013 the durability of silicone rubbers can be higher than conventional plastics which means once they enter the environment silicone can stay longer shit and shah 2013 muthukumar et al 2011 the silicone market size is growing fast yet there are few environmental impact studies on silicone rubbers to the best of our knowledge shit and shah 2013 muthukumar et al 2011 for the first time the sedimentation of silicone was studied in this work 3 4 the transport and fate of plastics by numerical modelling as shown in fig 5 a the floaters had a higher amount of accumulation in zone 1 over the first 96 steps 2 days of the simulation however at the end of the simulation period 5 days the number of residing floaters in zone 1 was 7 lower than the sinkers all studied plastics entered zone 2 at approximately the same rate with slightly more particles of the floaters fig 5b such observation can be explained as the result of solid inflow to zone 1 at the surface layer during the first two days of the simulation followed by intense outflows resulting in flushing of floating particles which tended to reside in the upper layers of the water column on the contrary the sinkers were more likely to sediment into the deeper water and be trapped effectively by the exchange flow at the estuary mouth geyer and maccready 2014 temporary drops in the number of particles in zone 1 between day two and day four were observed possibly due to the changes in the tidal range during the tidal cycles since the ratio of freshwater to seawater was not constant throughout the tidal process within the studied domain the tidal dynamics fluctuated as the freshwater from the upstream flowed over and mixed with the seawater from the downstream creating density and pressure gradients within the system geyer and maccready 2014 hachey 1934 fig 5 also demonstrates that more microplastics could enter the ocean through the saint john river compared to the pellets highlighting the impact of particle size on their movement pattern and environmental effects in their receiving water body it may be explained by the general flow characteristics in the saint john river estuary which involves freshwater inflow at the surface flowing over denser seawater driven by tidal currents at lower depths fig 6 a b the microplastic sinkers had a relatively low settling velocity than the pellet sinkers the surface water flow continuously carried the microplastics into the ocean resulting in a higher rate of transport of such particles in zone 2 geyer and maccready 2014 the tidal dynamics can also affect the concentration and distribution of plastic particles through vertical turbulent flux jay and musiak 1994 fig 6c d are snapshots of the particle distribution in zone 1 at time step 337 3 5 days when the number of floaters in zone 1 notably dropped as described in fig 5a the distribution of the sinkers e g pet and the floaters e g pe were distinct although the floaters were more widely dispersed than the sinkers at time step 337 the number of floater particles was 12 lower than the sinkers the sinkers were most likely trapped in estuarine turbidity maximum which was close to the coastline jay and musiak 1994 as discussed above it can be explained by the presence of floaters in the upper layer of the water column a 15 day simulation was performed for pet pellets sinker pet microplastics sinker and pe pellets floater to study the impact of the plastic settling floating velocity on the long term distribution fig s9 the accumulation pattern of the plastics in zone 2 mainly remained the same throughout the simulation in zone 1 however the number of pe decreased between days 5 and 9 and then stabilized the result of the longer simulation also confirmed the observation of the initial simulation regarding the higher rate of transport to the ocean for floaters compared to sinkers and microplastics compared to pellets the modelling study suggested that for a highly variable water setting where the magnitude of ambient velocity field and turbulent fluctuation outweighed the plastic vertical sedimentation velocity the fate and transport of the plastics were mainly controlled by the hydrodynamic conditions however the physicochemical properties of the plastics such as size and density selectively affected the accumulation in the trapping area of the water system water dynamics in different water systems are highly diverse due to irregular channel shapes and turbulence interactions maccready and geyer 2010 the water systems salinity varies with the fluctuation of the river discharge which will affect the vertical sedimentation of plastics hachey 1934 grabemann and krause 1989 it is crucial to consider both the water dynamics and particle physicochemical properties in determining the plastic particles distribution and transportation fate in water systems jay and musiak 1994 combining laboratory data with numerical modelling improved the prediction of micro nanoplastic hotspots in the studied hydrological system which could benefit future remediation processes some commonly used techniques for waterborne micro nanoplastic removal are discussed in note s12 conclusions in this work we used a novel nano digital inline holography microscope nano dihm for micro nanoplastic research we demonstrated that nano dihm can detect both micro and nanoplastics in water even with organic inorganic and biological coatings the same organic coating can form distinct coating patterns on the micro and nanoplastic particles depending on the particle size hence both plastic particles and coatings can be detected specifically regardless of the size of the particle this result points to high level of selectivity of nano dihm in plastic waste research in future nano dihm can follow the in situ and real time 4d 3d time movement trajectory of micro and nanoplastics in fluids and measure their sedimentation velocity particle size was the primary factor affecting the sedimentation rate for studied microplastics plastic pellets and silicone rubbers the presence of inorganic ions and organic coatings could affect the transportation fate of plastics in aquatic systems we also incorporated the experimental data into a predictive numerical model campsim 3d to provide further insight into the sedimentation processes of major microplastics and plastic alternatives in water modelling results indicated water dynamics dominated the plastic transport process in highly variable water settings the physicochemical properties of plastics affected the accumulation of microplastics and pellets in the river estuary in a selective way smaller and lighter plastic particles are more widely distributed in the river and more likely to enter the ocean as compared with their larger and high density counterparts the advances of nano dihm provide a novel approach for micro and nanoplastic coating and sedimentation studies this technique can be further implemented in studying other contaminants and dynamic processes in water this integrated experimental modelling study will aid the environmental impact assessments and targeted remediation studies of micro and nanoplastics in the water systems funding sources this work was supported by canadian foundation for innovation cfi 259754 natural

and ecosystem health studies andrady 2011 browne et al 2008 fendall and sewell 2009 browne et al 2011 yet limited studies indicate that the microplastic research in freshwater is 85 less than in seawater blettler et al 2018 faure et al 2015 meijer et al 2021 microplastics are found in freshwaters such as rivers lakes and lagoons some of which could be significant pathways and emissions of microplastics blettler et al 2018 faure et al 2015 lechner et al 2014 observation based studies estimate that over 1000 rivers are responsible for 80 of global riverine plastic waste outflows into the

al 2018 wang et al 2021a rangel alvarado et al 2019 there is a convergence of approaches suggesting that the physicochemical transformation of microplastics is key to understanding their environmental impacts gigault et al 2021 alimi et al 2022 factors such as particle size shape surface properties and coatings are amongst those uncertainties identified as knowledge gaps waldschläger and schüttrumpf 2019 alimi et al 2022 wang et al 2021b francalanci et al 2021 fazey and ryan 2016 for instance organics inorganics and biological coatings in the environment can alter the transportation fate of microplastics fazey and ryan 2016 kowalski et al 2016 li et al 2019 microplastics with given physicochemical properties when entering the surroundings will not have identical characteristics while transported in water or at air water interfaces gigault et al 2021 kowalski et al 2016 li et al 2019 kukulka et al 2012 thereby it is essential to quantify such processes dynamically yet more work needs to be done in real time wang et al 2021b using a newly developed nano digital inline holographic microscope nano dihm four dimensional 3d time tracking is feasible we can observe in situ

contaminations can lead to silicone degradation akbar et al 2019 feng et al 2014 huang et al 2019 rezaei et al 2013 gustavsson et al 2000 fernando and gubanski 2010 chaisaengsukkul et al 2010 however most studies have focused on the silicone materials rather than the environmental aspects rezaei et al 2013 gustavsson et al 2000 fernando and gubanski 2010 muthukumar et al 2011 in this work we performed in situ and real time physicochemical nano microplastic research namely coatings and sedimentation processes in water using nano dihm integrated physicochemical experiments and modelling research were conducted to explore the transport and fate of two different size categories of plastics and alternative plastic particles including i 10 to 700 µm microplastics hereafter and ii 1 to 5 mm pellets hereafter the settling floating processes of polyethylene pe polypropylene pp polystyrene ps polyethylene terephthalate pet polyurethane pur polyvinyl chloride pvc and two types of silicone rubbers with and without coatings in freshwater and seawater were studied semi empirical equations for the sedimentation of studied microplastics were developed and integrated into campsim 3d numerical model created by the national research council canada pilechi et al 2022 the transport of plastics was simulated and compared in the lower saint john river estuary in eastern canada to assess how the physicochemical properties of plastics can relate to their environmental impact in real world conditions we discussed the potential implications of the work on water research namely the identification of nano microplastic hotspots for improved plastics waste remediation 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample preparation and measurements the plastics studied here were chosen based on their market size and presence in the aquatic environment van melkebeke et al 2020 research and markets 2021 six groups of microplastics and plastic pellets with different densities including pe pp ps pet pur and pvc were studied two types of silicone silicone1 and silicone2 were examined as plastic alternatives artificial seawater ph 6 and ph 8 solutions were prepared for different scenarios a digital calliper and a nano dihm measured the particle size and shape the particle density was determined by a modified titration method waldschläger and schüttrumpf 2019 iso 1183 1 2019 khatmullina and isachenko 2017 see notes s1 s4 for details 2 2 nano dihm for micro nanoplastic coating study nano sized plastic particles 1 µm from selected groups were examined by a nano dihm and a high resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy hr s tem to explore the capability of nano dihm in studying the transformation and transport of nanoplastics pe pp ps and pur nanoplastics were synthesized in laboratory by a modified protocol note s5 ganguly and ariya 2019 magnetite oleic acid and phytoplankton were used as representatives of inorganic organic and biological coatings selected nano microplastics were mixed thoroughly with suspensions of coating materials for 24 h the mixtures of coated nano microplastics were deposited on optical slides and analysed by a nano dihm in nano dihm a spherical wave from a visible laser 405 nm here was emitted and passed through a pinhole hall et al 2022 4deep inwater imaging 2018 the incident light illuminated the analyte and interacted with the scattered light forming a magnified interference pattern on a screen fig 1 a pal et al 2021 garcia sucerquia et al 2006 the recorded interference pattern or the hologram was then numerically reconstructed to extract 3d information of the samples this study used a 4deep desktop dihm at 16 fps in stationary and dynamic modes the laser to sample and sample to camera distances were adjusted occasionally for optimal illumination a 4deep octopus software was used for reconstructions 4deep inwater imaging 2018 2 3 the sedimentation of microplastics 10 to 700 µm sedimentation experiments for microplastics were performed in an optical glass cuvette 12 5 mm in width 102 5 mm in length and 45 0 mm in height four scenarios were studied including deionized water artificial seawater ph 6 and ph 8 solutions the settling processes of pet pur and pvc microplastic sinkers were recorded by a nano dihm fig 1b particle size shape and trajectory were acquired by 4deep octopus software 4deep inwater imaging 2018 the injection of a suspension of nano sized polystyrene latex psl was followed to validate nano dihm for dynamic tracking of nanoplastics 2 4 the gradual descent of microplastics only some of the microplastic sinkers sedimented immediately after being released instead they kept floating on water surface for several days before starting to settle we called this observation gradual descent to further explore such a process we measured the daily and long term 60 days gradual descent of microplastics note s6 and fig s1 semi empirical equations for the gradual descent were developed 2 5 the settling floating velocity of pellets 1 to 5 mm sedimentation experiments for pe pp ps pet pur pvc and silicone pellets with and without oleic acid coatings were performed in a cylindrical glass chamber fig 1c depending on different scenarios the chamber was filled with deionized water or artificial seawater the experiments were recorded by a nikon coolpix 4500 digital camera the settling velocity was measured for the sinkers pet ps pur pvc and silicone1 the floating velocity was determined for the floaters pe pp and silicone2 see note s7 for more information corey shape factor csf equivalent spherical diameter esd unbounded velocity w particle reynolds number re dimensionless particle size d and the wall effect on the sedimentation velocity of studied microplastics and pellets were calculated and compared note s8 2 6 numerical modelling the modelling study was performed using campsim 3d a numerical framework developed at the national research council canada for simulating the fate and transport of microplastics in rivers lakes estuaries coastal waters and oceans pilechi et al 2022 campsim 3d was based on a three dimensional particle tracking model ptm coupled with a telemac 3d hydrodynamic modelling system hervouet 2007 the ptm incorporated the effect of particle characteristics like shape size and density on their movement through sedimentation at each time step selected hydrodynamic parameters of the ambient environment like the velocity field and vertical elevations were computed details are provided in note s9 to assess the impact of settling floating velocity on the distribution and environmental impact of plastics in real world conditions the modified model was applied to simulate the transport of studied microplastics and pellets in a 75 km long reach of the lower saint john river extending from evandale to the bay of fundy fig s2 the particles were monitored for five days corresponding to the minimum period after which no significant change was seen in the number of particles in zone 1 a representative trapping area of plastic pollution within the saint john river system and zone 2 the river mouth fig s2 the influence of the plastic sedimentation on the model prediction was assessed by comparing the ratio of the number of plastic particles n p accumulated in zone 1 and zone 2 to the total number of particles n p total 2 7 materials and supplies pet pp and ps pellets pe microplastics psl suspension zncl2 magnetite hcl solution naoh solution and oleic acid were from sigma aldrich thf was from thermo fisher scientific pe pellets were from alfa aesar pur pellets and microplastics were from tpuco silicone2 was from zhongshan morning tips technology pvc pellets were cut off from pvc mats silicone1 pellets were cut off from silicone drink coasters pp and pvc microplastics were from scientific polymer products pet and ps microplastics were from goodfellow and tosoh artificial sea salt was from instant ocean phytoplankton was from seachem ethanol was from greenfield global 3 results and discussion we explored the usage of nano dihm in two physicochemical micro nanoplastic research in water coatings section 3 1 and sedimentation section 3 2 we also provided probability functions of the gradual descent of selected microplastics the settling floating rate of studied pellets in different water conditions with and without coatings was compared section 3 3 the influence of particle sedimentation on modelling predictions as a standard tool for identifying accumulation zone and assessing the environmental impact of plastic pollution in water systems was discussed by comparing simulations for the plastic transport in the saint john river estuary section 3 4 3 1 nano dihm for micro nanoplastic coating studies there is an ambiguity in defining micro and nanoplastics in several studies the upper size limit of microplastics is 5 mm cai et al 2018 kaiser et al 2019 here we followed the internationally accepted metric units microplastics referred to plastics smaller than 1 mm and nano sized plastics smaller than 1 µm browne et al 2011 wang et al 2021a browne et al 2010 as the physicochemical characteristics of plastics will likely not remain the same when transported in dynamic matrices such as water the usage of metric units allows for less confusing terminologies it facilitates the data sharing system that will advance the field 3 1 1 the capability of nano dihm for nanoplastic detection shown in fig 2 is a comparison of hr s tem images and nano dihm reconstructions intensity and phase of ps and pur nanoplastics in water hr s tem results confirmed the particle size and shape obtained by nano dihm we herein showed that nano dihm could detect nanoplastics and characterize the particle properties in water nano dihm for nanoplastic coatings and dynamic processes were further explored and discussed in sections 3 1 2 and 3 2 1 nanoplastics have become an emerging threat to the environment and human health mitrano et al 2021 the high surface to volume ratio allows nanoplastics to undergo various transformations and be adsorbed by other anthropogenic or natural entities affecting their toxicity to aquatic organisms mitrano et al 2021 shen et al 2019 current nanoplastic research is limited due to methodological and technological barriers future advances in nano dihm techniques may allow diverse physicochemical and dynamic studies of nanoplastics in different environmental matrices hall et al 2022 3 1 2 organic inorganic and biological coatings on micro nanoplastics fig 3 depicts the nano dihm intensity and phase reconstructions of micro nanoplastics coated by various inorganic organic and biological materials in water different coatings produced different intensity phase images and crosscut profiles the intensity and phase crosscuts of the pe microplastic particle in deionized water fig 3a b exhibited lower spikes and variations than the one in artificial seawater fig 3c d this observation was consistent with the different chemical compositions of the two matrices as artificial seawater contained a higher amount of minerals which can give more signals magnetite coatings on the pet led to medium intense shoulder peaks fig 3e f meanwhile the magnetite nanoparticles scattered more light than other studied coatings indicated by the raised background noise fig 3e f phytoplankton on the pvc created signature intensity and phase signals fig 3g h extra examples are provided in fig s3 the same material can form distinct coating patterns depending on the particle size the organic coating led to regional signal spikes on the microplastic profiles whereas it formed layers of rings around the core of the pp nanoplastic particle displayed in fig 3i j are oleic acid droplets adsorbed a pp microplastic particles while fig 3k l show a nano sized pp particle entirely coated by oleic acid see fig s4 for more nanoplastic examples in the natural surroundings the physicochemical properties of micro nanoplastics including coatings can be affected by various ageing processes kokalj et al 2019 luo et al 2022 for instance physical abrasion can reduce the particle size uv radiation can cause surface oxidation and biodegradation can alter the plastic functional groups and lead to oligomeric fragmentations luo et al 2022 hüffer et al 2018 such changes could influence the polarity surface charge and hydrophobicity of micro nanoplastics affecting their adsorption activities and surface properties luo et al 2022 hüffer et al 2018 wu et al 2020 further long term studies on heterogeneous micro nanoplastics and coated plastic particles are recommended in future research micro nanoplastics can interact with many other particles like sediments minerals natural organic matters and microorganisms in natural water li et al 2019 lagarde et al 2016 oriekhova and stoll 2018 kaiser et al 2017 depending on the types of microplastics they can either adsorb on suspended particles and co settle together or keep floating on the water surface due to the high repulsive energy between the plastics and natural particles li et al 2019 lagarde et al 2016 song et al 2017 for instance some microorganisms can increase the average density of the plastic organism bodies leading to advanced sedimentation of plastic debris in water fazey and ryan 2016 kaiser et al 2017 ye and andrady 1991 woodall et al 2014 such processes can affect the transport and accumulation of micro nanoplastics this work provided a new approach to investigating the diverse coating processes of micro nanoplastics in complex environmental matrices 3 2 in situ and real time sedimentation of micro nanoplastics by nano dihm nano dihm can follow the in situ and real time 4d 3d time movements of both micro and nanoplastics videos 1 and 2 3 2 1 nano dihm for nanoplastic dynamic tracking a composite image of a series of consecutive intensity reconstructions exhibits the dynamics of 200 nm psl spheres in water fig 4 a a video is provided to demonstrate the real time movement of the nanoplastics video 1 the transport and retention of nanoplastics highly depend on hydrodynamics and water chemistry for instance a high flow rate and low salinity would increase the mobility of nanoplastics ling et al 2022 the psl used here was in a suspension with surfactants as the suspension was injected into water the movement of psl was mainly controlled by the inertia of the injection brownian motion otherwise is expected to dominant the movement if there were no surfactant and flow perturbation bain 2022 the movements of nanoplastics are expected to change when other materials exist for example the presence of ca2 can accelerate the aggregation of nanoplastics whereas humic acid ca2 complexation could stabilize nanoplastic particles in water singh et al 2019 3 2 2 the sedimentation of microplastics depicted in fig 4b is the sedimentation of a single pet microplastic particle in water showing the transformation of the particle during its settling the observed lateral rotation and non rectilinear motion of the particle agreed with the calculated settling reynolds number re suggesting a transitional hydraulic regime wang et al 2021b the sedimentation velocity of pet pur and pvc was measured whereas pe pp and ps floated on the water surface throughout the experiment fig s5 studied microplastics had irregular shapes with esd from 14 to 694 µm the microplastics were affected by the wall effect by 2 under our experimental conditions the wall effect did not significantly impact the results given that the blockage ratio measured as the ratio between the dimensions of the particle and the chamber was relatively low samantaray et al 2017 additionally since the wall effect minimizes at the chamber centre the particles were released as close to the chamber s central line as possible jing et al 2019 the settling rate as a function of particle size was tabulated in table s1 the settling velocity of the same category of microplastics in deionized water ph 6 and ph 8 solutions was not statistically distinct indicating that acidity alone within the studied ph range was not a critical factor in altering the sedimentation rate fig s6 in artificial seawater the presence of inorganic ions affected the microplastics with the lowest density the most in agreement with the observation of the studied pellets section 3 3 potential explanations of such observations are discussed in note s10 a linear relation was observed between the settling velocity and particle size for all studied microplastics fig s6 results suggested that particle shape within the studied range had minor effects on their settling velocity instead the particle size was more critical and positively correlated with the settling rate the sedimentation of microplastics with oleic acid coating was attempted however the microplastic sinkers became floating on the water surface due to the organic layer after an amount of time the coated microplastics attached to the cuvette wall and stopped moving this observation confirmed the impact of coatings on the transport of microplastics in aquatic systems ye and andrady 1991 woodall et al 2014 3 2 3 the gradual descent of microplastics in water effects of ions and ph although the microplastic floaters i e pe pp and ps aggregated due to high hydrophobic attraction the overwhelming buoyancy of water made them float on the water surface throughout the experiment li et al 2019 cai et al 2018 some microplastic sinkers i e pet pur and pvc did not settle immediately they kept floating for several days before starting to sediment we called this observation gradual descent we followed the daily and 60 day gradual descent of the microplastics fig s7 log logistic probability functions were developed to describe the relation between the level of gradual descent of different types of microplastics under different environmental conditions table s2 depending on the physicochemical properties of the microplastics the presence of inorganic ions may either speed up or slow down the long term gradual descent of the microplastics a negative relation between the particle size and the duration of gradual descent was observed fig s7 and table s3 although the density of pet was the largest amongst the three types of sinkers the duration of its gradual descent was the longest yet the lightest pur had the shortest period of gradual descent this observation might be explained by the prevailing surface tension over the gravity of pet bearing the smallest particle size as compared with pur park et al 2019 berthier and brakke 2012 detailed discussions can be found in note s11 3 3 the sedimentation of plastic pellets and silicone rubbers 1 to 5 mm the settling floating velocity of studied pellets and the effect of salts and organic coatings are depicted in table s4 the equivalent spherical diameter esd was applied for further comparison as studied pellets had diverse shapes from the sphere olivary ellipsoid and hemisphere to cylinder and cubic measured particle densities were smaller than theoretical values plausibly due to entrapped air bubbles especially for pe and pp the wall effect suppressed the sedimentation velocity of studied pellets by 4 to 6 flow separation caused secondary movements to waked vortices around the particles with irregular shapes and unsmooth surfaces implying increased drag force thus decreased settling floating velocity of studied pellets wang et al 2021b komar and reimers 1978 stringham et al 1969 the settling reynolds number of all studied pellets was between 1 and 103 it was consistent with the experimental observations where lateral rotation oscillation and occasionally non rectilinear motion trajectories were noticed during the particle sedimentation wang et al 2021b 3 3 1 the settling floating velocity in deionized water and artificial seawater as illustrated in table s4 the sinkers pet pur ps pvc and silicone1 were denser than water and sank to the water bottom the floaters included pe pp and silicone2 density alone should not be used to classify sinkers and floaters apart from buoyancy other vertical forces can also counterbalance gravity berthier and brakke 2012 liu et al 2013 factors like particle geometry size surface properties and hydraulic conditions should be considered berthier and brakke 2012 ryan 2015 density was used as the criterion here as the pellets had reasonable size 1 to 5 mm with irregular but mostly near spheric or cubic shapes fig s8a c plot the floating velocity of pe pp and silicone2 pellets in deionized water artificial seawater and deionized water with oleic acid coating the t test indicated that the three scenarios were statistically distinct where pe had the most considerable change in floating velocity followed by silicone2 and pp this observation could be explained by the differences in the relative density between the particle and the medium the floating velocity of studied pp pellets had the most significant standard deviations in all scenarios plausibly due to the lowest particle uniformity in shape and size although the particle shape and chemical composition of pp and silicone2 were different they had similar floating velocities likely due to their similar size and density wang et al 2021b amongst the sinkers ps exhibited the most significant settling velocity variation followed by pur pet silicone1 and pvc fig s8d h it could be explained by the lowest particle medium density difference of ps amongst the sinkers pur and pvc pellets shared similar density and particle size and similar settling velocity table s4 although they had different shapes surface roughness and distinct chemical compositions the increase in water density reduced the settling velocity of the sinkers by 13 and enhanced the floating rate of the floaters by 9 under the experimental condition due to their relatively low density plastic particles are more sensitive to the surroundings than dense sediments making the accurate prediction of their transportation and fate in water challenging cai et al 2018 kumar et al 2010 gewert et al 2015 lu et al 2018 3 3 2 the effect of organic coating oleic acid coating reduced the settling velocity of the sinkers by 9 and changed the floating rate of floaters by 5 since the densities of studied settling plastics from 1056 to 1353 kg m3 were higher than oleic acid 895 kg m³ the coating reduced the overall density of the plastic coating body with respective to the plastic particle itself which may lead to a decrease in settling velocity for the floaters the density of pe 920 kg m3 was larger than oleic acid thus the coating reduced the overall plastic coating body s density and led to a higher floating velocity the density of pp 866 kg m3 was lower than 895 kg m³ thereby a decreased floating rate was expected for silicone2 the floating rate of the coated pellet was higher than expected plausibly due to air entrapment between the coarse particle surface and the oleic acid layer however further research is recommended to accurately evaluate this hypothesis this observation hinted that plastic pellets might suspend for a longer time in water with organic coatings and travel longer distances oleic acid coating also caused the attachment of particles to the chamber wall during their sedimentation and hampered the falling rising motions it also caused particle aggregation where the sedimentation of the aggregates was faster than single particles this observation indicated that coatings might change the mobility and distribution of plastics in water consequently altering the transportation pathways and the location of accumulation 3 3 3 the settling floating of silicone rubbers the sedimentation of the industrial silicone silicone2 was remarkably different from the ones used for cookware silicone1 as shown in table s4 silicone2 was lighter than water and floated and silicone1 was denser and sank silicone1 was distinct from other plastic pellets for its air retaining property silicone1 had air bubbles firmly attached to the particle underwater over the entire experiment period such a phenomenon was caused by the attraction between the superhydrophobic surfaces and air bubbles relating to the particle chemical composition and 3d topography sonoyama and iguchi 2002 kibar et al 2013 chen et al 2015 the actual sedimentation velocity without bubbles of silicone1 speculatively is higher than the measured values silicone has been widely used as a plastic substitute in industries with expanding applications shit and shah 2013 the durability of silicone rubbers can be higher than conventional plastics which means once they enter the environment silicone can stay longer shit and shah 2013 muthukumar et al 2011 the silicone market size is growing fast yet there are few environmental impact studies on silicone rubbers to the best of our knowledge shit and shah 2013 muthukumar et al 2011 for the first time the sedimentation of silicone was studied in this work 3 4 the transport and fate of plastics by numerical modelling as shown in fig 5 a the floaters had a higher amount of accumulation in zone 1 over the first 96 steps 2 days of the simulation however at the end of the simulation period 5 days the number of residing floaters in zone 1 was 7 lower than the sinkers all studied plastics entered zone 2 at approximately the same rate with slightly more particles of the floaters fig 5b such observation can be explained as the result of solid inflow to zone 1 at the surface layer during the first two days of the simulation followed by intense outflows resulting in flushing of floating particles which tended to reside in the upper layers of the water column on the contrary the sinkers were more likely to sediment into the deeper water and be trapped effectively by the exchange flow at the estuary mouth geyer and maccready 2014 temporary drops in the number of particles in zone 1 between day two and day four were observed possibly due to the changes in the tidal range during the tidal cycles since the ratio of freshwater to seawater was not constant throughout the tidal process within the studied domain the tidal dynamics fluctuated as the freshwater from the upstream flowed over and mixed with the seawater from the downstream creating density and pressure gradients within the system geyer and maccready 2014 hachey 1934 fig 5 also demonstrates that more microplastics could enter the ocean through the saint john river compared to the pellets highlighting the impact of particle size on their movement pattern and environmental effects in their receiving water body it may be explained by the general flow characteristics in the saint john river estuary which involves freshwater inflow at the surface flowing over denser seawater driven by tidal currents at lower depths fig 6 a b the microplastic sinkers had a relatively low settling velocity than the pellet sinkers the surface water flow continuously carried the microplastics into the ocean resulting in a higher rate of transport of such particles in zone 2 geyer and maccready 2014 the tidal dynamics can also affect the concentration and distribution of plastic particles through vertical turbulent flux jay and musiak 1994 fig 6c d are snapshots of the particle distribution in zone 1 at time step 337 3 5 days when the number of floaters in zone 1 notably dropped as described in fig 5a the distribution of the sinkers e g pet and the floaters e g pe were distinct although the floaters were more widely dispersed than the sinkers at time step 337 the number of floater particles was 12 lower than the sinkers the sinkers were most likely trapped in estuarine turbidity maximum which was close to the coastline jay and musiak 1994 as discussed above it can be explained by the presence of floaters in the upper layer of the water column a 15 day simulation was performed for pet pellets sinker pet microplastics sinker and pe pellets floater to study the impact of the plastic settling floating velocity on the long term distribution fig s9 the accumulation pattern of the plastics in zone 2 mainly remained the same throughout the simulation in zone 1 however the number of pe decreased between days 5 and 9 and then stabilized the result of the longer simulation also confirmed the observation of the initial simulation regarding the higher rate of transport to the ocean for floaters compared to sinkers and microplastics compared to pellets the modelling study suggested that for a highly variable water setting where the magnitude of ambient velocity field and turbulent fluctuation outweighed the plastic vertical sedimentation velocity the fate and transport of the plastics were mainly controlled by the hydrodynamic conditions however the physicochemical properties of the plastics such as size and density selectively affected the accumulation in the trapping area of the water system water dynamics in different water systems are highly diverse due to irregular channel shapes and turbulence interactions maccready and geyer 2010 the water systems salinity varies with the fluctuation of the river discharge which will affect the vertical sedimentation of plastics hachey 1934 grabemann and krause 1989 it is crucial to consider both the water dynamics and particle physicochemical properties in determining the plastic particles distribution and transportation fate in water systems jay and musiak 1994 combining laboratory data with numerical modelling improved the prediction of micro nanoplastic hotspots in the studied hydrological system which could benefit future remediation processes some commonly used techniques for waterborne micro nanoplastic removal are discussed in note s12 conclusions in this work we used a novel nano digital inline holography microscope nano dihm for micro nanoplastic research we demonstrated that nano dihm can detect both micro and nanoplastics in water even with organic inorganic and biological coatings the same organic coating can form distinct coating patterns on the micro and nanoplastic particles depending on the particle size hence both plastic particles and coatings can be detected specifically regardless of the size of the particle this result points to high level of selectivity of nano dihm in plastic waste research in future nano dihm can follow the in situ and real time 4d 3d time movement trajectory of micro and nanoplastics in fluids and measure their sedimentation velocity particle size was the primary factor affecting the sedimentation rate for studied microplastics plastic pellets and silicone rubbers the presence of inorganic ions and organic coatings could affect the transportation fate of plastics in aquatic systems we also incorporated the experimental data into a predictive numerical model campsim 3d to provide further insight into the sedimentation processes of major microplastics and plastic alternatives in water modelling results indicated water dynamics dominated the plastic transport process in highly variable water settings the physicochemical properties of plastics affected the accumulation of microplastics and pellets in the river estuary in a selective way smaller and lighter plastic particles are more widely distributed in the river and more likely to enter the ocean as compared with their larger and high density counterparts the advances of nano dihm provide a novel approach for micro and nanoplastic coating and sedimentation studies this technique can be further implemented in studying other contaminants and dynamic processes in water this integrated experimental modelling study will aid the environmental

14911,this study developed novel active capping systems with recycling convenience using ferrihydrite fh combined with magnetite mag and investigated the effectiveness and mechanism for the restriction of endogenous phosphorus movement from sediment into overlying water ow by the combined use of fh and mag the fh mag combined amendment effectively hindered endogenous phosphorus release from sediment to ow in dissolved oxygen do deficit environment and the immobilization of diffusion gradient in thin film labile phosphorus lpdgt and mobile phosphorus in the sediment played a key role in the control of endogenous phosphorus liberation by the fh mag combined amendment combined capping sediment with fh and mag effectively hindered endogenous phosphorus release from sediment to ow in anoxic environment and the inactivation of lpdgt in the upper sediment played a key part in the control of sediment phosphorus release by the fh mag mixture capping the stability of phosphorus immobilized by the fh mag combined covering layer was related to its construction way and the majority around 90 of p immobilized to the fh mag mixture covering layer had low risk of release in common ph 5 9 and do deficit environments the fh mag mixture amendment or capping did not increase the risk of sediment iron release and it also did not produce a large impact on the diversity and richness of bacterial community in the sediment the combined utilization of fh and mag as a composite amendment or capping material to prevent the internal phosphorus from being moved to ow can make full use of their respective advantages the fh mag mixture capping wrapped by permeable fabric has high potential to reduce the risk of endogenous phosphorus from sediment into ow due to its advantages of high internal phosphorus release suppression efficiency environmental friendliness application convenience and sustainability graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ferrihydrite magnetite

ecosystems characterized by harmful algal blooms habs is a worldwide environmental issue at present geng et al 2022 zhou et al 2022 habs not only can result in the water quality deterioration biological diversity loss and ecosystem structure function alteration but also can endanger the safety of water supply and the health of human body geng et al 2022 jiang et al 2022 sun et al 2022a phosphorus p as an indispensable macronutrient element for algae growth is considered to be a main restriction factor causing freshwater eutrophication correll 1998 sun et al 2022b external p input and internal p release from sediment both can have an effect upon the concentration of p in the overlying water ow if the external input of p is under the effective control the continuous release of legacy p from sediment still can bring about the elevated concentration of overlying water p sun et al 2022a yin et al 2022 this makes it necessary to adopt sediment p release control measures to decrease the internal p loads and to speed up the recovery of eutrophic fresh water bodies hilt et al 2006 lürling and van oosterhout 2013 the methods for the control of sediment p release can be categorized into two types ex situ and in situ methods the ex situ sediment dredging method has been employed to reduce sediment p release li et al 2020b the in situ methods include aeration yin et al 2019 nitrate injection lin et al 2021 calcium aluminum or iron salt inactivation dittrich et al 2011 huser et al 2016 li et al 2020a wikström et al 2021 inert material capping xu et al 2012 and active capping amendment aca wang et al 2017a wang et al 2021 xia et al 2022 yin et al 2020b among these available methods aca is broadly believed to a promising strategy for reducing the internal p loads wang et al 2017a wang et al 2021 wikström et al 2021 xia et al 2022 yin et al 2020b some p inactivating solid phase materials pisms with high p immobilization ability have been proposed to prevent sediment p release these pisms include lanthanum based pisms e g lanthanum modified bentontie clay waajen et al 2016 lanthanum carbonate wu et al 2022a and lanthanum modified zeolite li et al 2021

fe3o4 chen et al 2021b and magnetic particles álvarez manzaneda et al 2019b de vicente et al 2010 funes et al 2016 amongst them iron based pisms fe pisms have received an increasing attention in recent years because of their ubiquity low cost environmental friendliness and high sedimentary p release interception efficiency under aerobic condition de vicente et al 2010 wang et al 2021 wu et al 2022b xia et al 2022 it should be noted that fe pisms can be classified into two types non magnetic fe pisms nm fe pisms and magnetic fe pisms m fe pisms the fe rich pisms can effectively immobilize p in sediment under aerobic condition via adsorption or precipitation mechanism mucci et al 2018 xia et al 2022 however owing to the microbial reduction of iron iii to iron ii the p adsorbed by the iron iii oxides hydroxides can be migrated into the interstitial and overlying waters under anoxic condition hu et al 2022 kleeberg et al 2013 rapin et al 2019 xia et al 2022 after the application of nm fe pisms the added nm fe pisms are commonly difficult to recycle and the p immobilized by the nm fe pisms that stay in the sediment is possibly moved into the interstitial and overlying waters in the end if the redox condition changes from oxic condition to anoxic condition funes et al 2017b thus the long term effectiveness of nm fe pisms to immobilize p in sediment still needs to be further evaluated and the removal of p loaded nm fe pisms from the water body after their application may be very necessary to overcome the drawbacks of nm fe pisms to suppress sediment p liberation the method based on m fe pisms has been put forward de vicente et al 2010 funes et al 2016 funes et al 2017b applying a magnetic separation gradient is a good method to achieve the recovery of the used m fe pisms álvarez manzaneda et al 2019a funes et al 2016 funes et al 2017a funes et al 2017b however if no effective measure is taken to prevent the mixing of the applied m fe pisms with sediment the recovery of the m fe pisms within the sediment will become very difficult therefore it is still very necessary to develop a novel fe pisms based active capping system with recycling convenience for the effective interception of endogenous p liberation in addition to capping amendment is another mode for applying fe pisms to control p release from sediment different fe pisms may have different performances for p immobilization in sediment the combined use of different fe pisms as a composite amendment may make use of their respective advantages to prevent sediment p release ferrihydrite fh and magnetite mag are typical nm fe pism and m fe pism for sedimentary p liberation respectively chen et al 2021b zou et al 2017 the main objectives of this work were i to develop novel active capping systems with recycling convenience using fh combined with mag and ii to explore the effectiveness and mechanism for the control of endogenous p release by the combined use of fh and mag as active capping and amendment materials to this end batch adsorption experiment and x ray photoelectron spectra xps analysis were applied to study the performance and mechanism of phosphate h m po4 m 3 m 0 1 2 or 3 adsorption onto fh and mag at first and then the effects of combined amendment and capping using fh and mag on the p transportation and transformation in sediment water system were explored by adopting sediment incubation experiments the findings from this study could be used to guide a new development of fh mag combined amendment and capping methods for sediment p release and eutrophication management 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the sediment used in this work was collected using a grab sampler from an artificial scenic fresh water body which is located in

acquired by a smartlab9 x ray diffraction spectrometer riken corporation japan the broad scan and narrow scan xps spectra of fh and mag samples before and after h m po4 m 3 adsorption were collected through an escalab 250xi x ray photoelectron spectrometer which was supplied by thermo fisher scientific usa the narrow scan xps spectra were fitted using xpspeak41 software and the shirley background was applied han et al 2012 the lorentzian gaussian ratio was fixed at 30 2 3 adsorption experiment adsorption equilibrium experiments were performed in a shaker with 25 c at 150 rpm for twenty four hours to determine the impact of coexisting electrolyte upon h m po4 m 3 adsorption onto fh or mag 25 mg of fh or mag was introduced into 25 ml of h m po4 m 3 solutions without and with coexisting electrolyte ph 7 0 respectively for the coexisting electrolyte effect study the initial concentration of phosphorus was specified at 20 mg l and the initial coexisting electrolyte nacl nahco3 na2so4 kcl cacl2 or mgcl2 concentration was specified at 2 mmol l the effect of initial h m po4 m 3 concentration on h m po4 m 3 uptake by fh was studied by mixing 25 mg of fh with 25 ml of h m po4 m 3 solutions without and with the simultaneous existence of common cations and anions initial phosphorus concentrations 5 10 15 20 25 and 30 mg l ph 7 0 respectively the effect of initial h m po4 m 3

k f mg 1 1 n l 1 n g is referred to the freundlich constant 2 4 sediment incubation experiment the influences of single and combined treatments amendment and capping on the p transportation and transformation in sediment water system were explored by adopting 250 ml wide mouth brown reagent bottle as sediment incubation reactor eighteen bottles containing 20 g of air dried sediment were applied and these bottles were randomly separated into nine groups two bottles were contained in each group nine groups were suffered from the following treatments respectively 1 control group no treatment 2 fh amendment group 2 g 3 mag amendment group 2 g 4 fh mag combined amendment group 1 g of fh 1 g of mag 5 fabric fc wrapped fh capping group 2 g 6 fabric wrapped mag capping group 2 g 7

combined capping group with fabric wrapped fh capping at first and then fabric wrapped mag capping cs3 1 g of fh 1 g of mag fig s1 the role of fc in the fc wrapped capping system was to prevent the mixing of sediment with the capping material qu et al 2023 wu et al 2022a the natural water was deoxygenated by the na2so3 oxygenation method kim et al 2003 the concentration of dissolved oxygen do in the deoxygenated water was 0 5 mg l after the deoxygenated water was prepared it was slowly siphoned into all the bottles until the free space above the sediment was full of water to make the sediment in anoxic environment rubber plugs were applied to close all the bottles during incubation period the do concentration and ph value of ow were monitored at regular intervals with portable do and ph analyzers respectively after each measurement of do and ph the ow samples were taken by a syringe to monitor the concentration of dissolved soluble p drp with the molybdenum blue method lan et al 2022 on the 63rd day of incubation the sediment and covering material were collected after air drying the as obtained samples were ground through a 0 150 mm sieve to analyze phosphorus forms the p forms in the sediment and capping material were classified into weakly adsorbed phosphorus wa p extracted with ammonium chloride reducible phosphorus r p extracted with bicarbonate dithionite bd phosphorus bound to metal oxide hydroxide naoh srp extracted with naoh at 298 k calcium magnesium bound phosphorus hcl p extracted with hcl and residual phosphorus res p extracted with naoh at 358 k lin et al 2019 rydin 2000 after each extraction step the sediment and covering material samples were centrifuged afterwards the supernatant was filtered by 0 45 µm filter membrane after that the concentration of drp in the filtrate was detected with the molybdenum antimony anti spectrophotometry method gao et al 2022b finally the percentages of different p forms to the total p tot p were calculated the xrd patterns of fh and mag after their application were acquired by a smartlab9 x ray diffraction spectrometer riken corporation japan the impacts of combined amendment and covering on the p transportation and transformation in sediment water system were further researched using column with 10 cm of inner diameter and 27 cm of height as sediment incubation reactor the fresh wet sediment from the sampling site was placed into the column until the sediment depth attained 100 mm then we divided eight columns into four groups at random and two columns were included in each group four groups were suffered from the following treatments respectively 1 control group no treatment 2 fh mag combined amendment group 4 g of fh 4 g of mag 3 fh mag mixture capping group 4 g of fh 4 g of mag cs1 without fabric wrapping 4 fabric wrapped fh mag mixture capping group 4 g of fh 4 g of mag cs1 with fabric wrapping fig s2 after the natural water was deoxygenated by the na2so3 oxygenation method kim et al 2003 it was slowly siphoned into all the reactors to fill the free space above the sediment after the water level arrived at the mouth of the column rubber plugs were applied to close all the columns during incubation period the do and ph of ow were detected at regular intervals with portable do and ph analyzers respectively after the measurements of do and ph the ow samples were taken through a syringe and filtered through 0 45 µm filter membrane the drp concentration of ow was detected with the ascorbic acid molybate spectrophotometric method markovic et al 2019 on 75 and 143 days of incubation zrochelex dgt devices were vertically inserted into the sediments in the control combined amendment and direct combined capping reactors after twenty four hours we retrieved the zrochelex dgt devices from the sediments the dgt gels were cut into slices at 2 mm intervals then the obtained slices were immersed in 400 µl of 1 mol l hno3 and 400 µl of 1 mol l naoh solutions respectively chen et al 2019b after elution the concentrations of drp and fe2 in the eluent were detected with the molybdenum blue and phenanthroline colorimetric methods respectively chen et al 2019b the concentrations of dgt labile p lpdgt and dgt labile fe lfedgt in the sediment and overlying water were calculated according to the established method chen et al 2019b on the 168th day of incubation the sediments in the control combined amendment and combined capping reactors were sampled and analyzed using high throughput sequencing based on an illumina miseq platform the concrete steps for the sediment microbial community analysis have been described in the previous literature wu et al 2022a 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of fh and mag fig 1 presents the xrd patters of fh and mag as depicted in fig 1a the as synthesized fh sample showed two typical broad peaks at around 34 and 61 of 2θ indicative of weakly crystallized ferrihydrite like phase this is consistent with the results previously reported liang et al 2021 liang et al 2022b zhang et al 2019 the major characteristic peaks in the xrd pattern of mag fig 1b were in line with the standard pattern of pure magnetite lee and kim 2022 shahid et al 2019 this demonstrates that the as prepared mag sample is mainly composed of magnetite 3 2 adsorption of phosphate on fh and mag the effect of coexisting electrolyte on h m po4 m 3 adsorption onto fh and mag is presented in fig 2 a as fig 2a seen the introduction of na k cl and so4 2 had a negligible impact on the h m po4 m 3 adsorption onto fh and mag however coexisting ca2 and mg2 both improved the uptake of h m po4 m 3 by fh and mag in contrast to the influence of ca2 and mg2 coexisting hco3 suppressed the adsorption of h m po4 m 3 on fh and mag commonly the uptake of h m po4 m 3 by metal oxides hydroxides is dominated by the balance of outer sphere and inter sphere complexes chen et al 2022 su et al 2013 generally the h m po4 m 3 adsorption due to the outer sphere complexation is sensitive to the change of ionic strength chen et al 2022 su et al 2013 however the adsorption of h m po4 m 3 due to the inner sphere complexation is insensitive to the change in ionic strength or enhanced by the increase in the ionic strength chen et al 2022 su et al 2013 the limited effects of nacl kcl and na2so4 on the h m po4 m 3 adsorption onto fh and mag imply that the adsorption obeys the inner sphere complexing mechanism in the absence of coexisting electrolyte the inner sphere iron phosphate binary complexes e g fe opo oh 2 fe opo o2h and feo 2 po oh will be formed liu et al 2020 xiong et al 2017 the promoting effects of ca2 and mg2 are explained as follows coexisting ca2 and mg2 can react with h m po4 m 3 to form cahpo4 and mghpo4 lin et al 2020b iron oxide can adsorb cahpo4 and mghpo4 to generate the hpo4 2 bridged ternary surface complexes i e fe opo3h ca and fe opo3h mg antelo et al 2015 lin et al 2020b liu et al 2020 yu et al 2022 compared to the free phosphate anions the formed cahpo4 and mghpo4 are easy to be adsorbed by fh and mag lin et al 2020b this gives rise to the enhancement of h m po4 m 3 adsorption onto fh and mag by the existence of ca2 or mg2 the inhibitory effect of hco3 on the h m po4 m 3 adsorption onto fh and mag is due to the competition of hco3 with h m po4 m 3 for the adsorption active sites on the surfaces of adsorbents afridi et al 2019 peng et al 2022 the adsorption isotherms of h m po4 m 3 on fh and mag without and with the simultaneous presence of common anions and cations are displayed in fig 2b and c respectively in the range of tested initial phosphate p concentration the amounts of bound h m po4 m 3 on fh and mag increased with the increase of equilibrium phosphate p concentration until adsorption equilibrium was achieved or continuously increased with the rise of equilibrium phosphate p concentration fig 2b and c furthermore the simultaneous presence of common anions cl hco3 and so4 2 and cations na k ca2 and mg2 greatly promoted the adsorption of h m po4 m 3 on fh and mag which was mainly ascribed to the promotive effects of ca2 and mg2 on the uptake of h m po4 m 3 by fh and mag table 1 summarizes the relevant isotherm model parameters it was concluded from table 1 that the langmuir isotherm model r 2 0 941 0 959 can better describe the h m po4 m 3 adsorption onto fh than the freundlich isotherm model r 2 0 895 0 907 while the latter r 2 0 920 0 943 can better describe the h m po4 m 3 adsorption onto mag than the former r 2 0 571 0 762 the maximum h m po4 m 3 adsorption capacity for fh in the simultaneous presence of common anions and cations 22 5 mg g was remarkably greater than that in the simultaneous absence of common anions and cations 14 4 mg g the k f value for mag with the simultaneous existence of common anions and cations was significantly higher than that in the simultaneous absence of common anions and cations these results further confirm the improvement of h m po4 m 3 adsorption onto fh and mag by the simultaneous presence of common anions and cations in addition in the simultaneous absence of common anions and cations the maximum adsorption capacity of fh towards h m po4 m 3 was remarkably larger than that of mag there was a similar phenomenon in the simultaneous presence of common anions and cations thus from the standpoint of the phosphate adsorption capacity fh is more suitable as an adsorbent for h m po4 m 3 elimination from water than mag the underlying mechanism for h m po4 m 3 adsorption onto fh and mag in the simultaneous absence of common anions and cations has been extensively studied arai and sparks 2001 fu et al 2018 lee and kim 2022 liu et al 2018 liu et al 2021 mallet et al 2013 the substitution of fe oh group with h m po4 m 3 to form the inner sphere iron phosphate binary complex is a crucial mechanism for the adsorptive removal of h m po4 m 3 by fh and mag in the simultaneous absence of common anions and cations arai and sparks 2001 fu et al 2018 lee and kim 2022 liu et al 2018 liu et al 2021 mallet et al 2013 in order to elucidate the mechanism for the uptake of h m po4 m 3 by fh and mag in the simultaneous presence of common anions and cations the xps analyses on the original and h m po4 m 3 adsorbed fh and mag samples were performed and the results are given in figs 3 and 4 the wide scan xps spectra of the raw fh and mag samples indicated the simultaneous presence of iron and oxygen elements in the as prepared fh and mag figs 3a and 4a the fe 2p spectrum for the raw fh fig 3b shows the characteristic peaks of fe 2p1 2 and fe 2p3 2 at binding energy be of 724 66 ev and 710 98 ev respectively the fe 2p spectrum for the p loaded fh fig 3b shows the characteristic peaks of fe 2p1 2 and fe 2p3 2 at be of 724 66 ev and 710 92 ev respectively this indicates that the fe in the as prepared fh exists in the form of iron oxide peng et al 2022 the high resolution xps spectra of fe 2p for the raw and p loaded mag samples fig 4b show that the fe in the as prepared mag exists in the form of iron oxide peng et al 2022 the be values of p 2p1 2 and p 2p3 2 peaks for the p loaded fh were found to be 133 95 ev and 133 23 ev respectively fig 3c and those for the p loaded mag were determined to be 134 01 ev and 133 07 ev respectively fig 4c these values were higher when compared to the be value of p 2p peak for the adsorbed phosphate through the electrostatic attraction mechanism i e 131 9 ev dong et al 2017 and the be value of p 2p peak for the nah2po4 2h2o reference salt i e 132 9 ev mallet et al 2013 this demonstrates the formation of inner sphere iron phosphate binary surface complex after the uptake of h m po4 m 3 by fh and mag the o 1 s peak for the raw fh and mag can be separated into three overlapped peaks which match up to lattice oxygen derived from fe o ol iron bound hydroxyl group oh and adsorbed water ow after h m po4 m 3 adsorption the percentage of oh decreased suggesting that hydroxyl group was involved in the adsorption process of h m po4 m 3 on fh and mag considering the results discussed above it was proposed that the underlying mechanism for h m po4 m 3 adsorption onto fh and mag in the simultaneous presence of common anions and cations was the exchange of fe oh groups with the phosphate species in water to form the inner sphere iron phosphate complexes and the formed inner sphere iron phosphate complexes not only included the inner sphere iron phosphate binary complexes e g fe opo oh 2 fe opo o2h and feo 2 po oh but also included the phosphate bridged fe p ca and fe p mg ternary complexes e g fe opo3h ca and fe opo3h mg 3 3 effect of fh mag combined amendment on p mobilization in sediment the influences of single fh single mag and fh mag combined amendments on the transport and transformation of p in the system of sediment and ow were explored by adopting bottles as reactors and the obtained results are presented in figs 5 and 6 do and ph are important environmental parameters that dominate the transportation and transformation of p in ow sediment system chen et al 2021a as seen in fig 5a the overlying waters in the control and amendment reactors were maintained under the anoxic condition li et al 2022b as fig 5b depicts the overlying waters in the control and amendment reactors had near neutral ph values it is obvious that the amendments of sediments with fh mag and their mixture produce a limited effect on the ow ph during 14 63 days incubation the drp concentrations of ow in the control reactor were 0 215 0 543 mg l fig 5c in addition with the rise of incubation from 14 to 28 days and from 42 to 56 days the drp concentration of ow in the control reactor increased fig 5c these results indicate that if no control measure is taken a large quantity of endogenous p can be released from sediment to ow under anoxic conditions a widely accepted opinion is that under anoxic environments the reduction of fe iii minerals to soluble fe ii species driven by fe reducing microorganisms takes place and the p associated to the fe iii minerals is released to ow gao et al 2016 hu et al 2022 kong et al 2021 the concentration of drp in ow under the amendment condition was obviously lower than that under no amendment condition fig 5c the concentration of drp in ow decreased by 94 7 99 5 94 7 99 1 and 96 2 100 after the amendments of sediments with single fh single mag and their mixture respectively fig 5d these results demonstrate that single fh single mag and their mixture all can be used as sediment amendments to effectively hinder sedimentary p liberation into ow under the anoxic condition the risk of endogenous p release from sediment is closely linked to its fractionation rydin 2000 wen et al 2020 yang et al 2022 wa p stands for the weakly immobilized p and it is unstable rydin 2000 wen et al 2020 r p is referred to the reductant soluble p associated to iron and manganese oxides hydroxides and it has high releasing risk under the anoxic condition rydin 2000 wen et al 2020 both wa p and r p belong to the potential mobile p mob p meis et al 2012 naoh srp is conventionally regarded as a relatively stable p sink and this p species is insensitive to redox potential change yang et al 2022 hcl p is the relatively stable fraction of p and it is only liberated under low ph conditions rydin 2000 wen et al 2020 yang et al 2022 res p represents the most stable p fraction and has the lowest risk of release wen et al 2020 the sediments in the control and amendment reactors had a very limited quantity of wa p fig 6a after the amendments of sediments with fh mag and their mixture the concentrations of r p and hcl p in the sediment decreased but the quantities of naoh srp and res p in the sediment increased fig 6a obviously the amount of mob p in sediment decreased after the single fh single mag and fh mag combined amendments this demonstrates that the uses of fh mag and their mixture as amendments all can decrease the risk of sedimentary p liberation it can be inferred from fig 6b that the reduction of potential mob p in sediment by the fh mag and their mixture additions is mainly due to the fact that the p form is transformed from r p to naoh srp and res p it should be noted that although the percentage of mob p in the mag amended sediment was basically same to that in the fh amended sediment the percentage of res p to tot p in the former was much higher than that in the latter fig 6b this demonstrates that from the point of view of the p speciation conversion the utilization of mag as an amendment material to inactivate the endogenous p in sediment is better than that of fh considering that fh exhibited much higher h m po4 m 3 adsorption capacity than mag the combined use of fh and mag as a composite amendment material to inactivate the endogenous p in sediment can make full use of their respective advantages the endogenous p release from sediment has a close association with the concentration of mob p rydin 2000 tammeorg et al 2022 therefore the reduction of mob p in sediment was critical to the restriction of endogenous p liberation into ow by the combined fh mag combined amendment the influence of fh mag combined amendment on the transport and transformation of phosphorus in sediment ow system was further explored using columns as reactors and the obtained results are given in figs 7 9 the sediments in the control and amendment columns were incubated under anoxic conditions fig 7a the ow ph in the control and fh mag combined amendment columns approached to neutral fig 7b however the fh mag combined amendment slightly increased the ph value of ow this may be owed to the ligand exchange of fh mag bound hydroxyl fe oh group with h m po4 m 3 resulting in the release of oh from fh and mag as illustrated in fig 7c as the incubation time rose the concentration of drp in ow under no treatment condition increased till a maximum value was achieved on the whole further indicating that a large quantity of p in sediment is easily migrated to ow under anoxic conditions the drp concentrations of ow in the fh mag combined amendment column were 0 004 0 030 mg l the reduction rates of drp in ow by the fh mag combined amendment were 83 0 97 5 this further indicates that the fh mag combined amendment can effectively hinder the release of endogenous phosphorus from sediment to ow under anoxic conditions the process of sediment p migrated into ow generally includes two basic sub processes ding et al 2015 one is the liberation of endogenous p from sediment to the pore water pw ding et al 2015 the other is the molecular diffusion of soluble p from pw to ow across the sediment ow interface ding et al 2015 dgt technique can be used to study the dynamic process of endogenous p transport from sediment to ow chen et al 2019b chen et al 2015 ding et al 2015 yin et al 2022 lpdgt can be a good reflection of the ability for the release of mob p from sediment to pw and the potential for the migration of mob p from sediment to ow yin et al 2022 on the 75th and 143rd days of incubation experiment there was a certain concentration of lpdgt in the ow sediment profile under no treatment condition fig 8 furthermore the concentration of lpdgt in sediment was equal to or higher than that in ow on the whole fig 8 in addition a high concentration of lfedgt was found in the sediment profile under no treatment condition after 75 and 143 days incubation fig 9 these results confirm that under anoxic conditions phosphorus can be liberated from sediment into pw through fe p coupling mechanism and the dgt measured labile p can be further migrated into ow the concentration of lpdgt in ow and sediment under fh mag combined amendment condition was significantly lower than that under the condition of no treatment fig 8 the removal rates of lpdgt in ow and sediment by the fh mag combined amendment on the 75th day of incubation were found to be 30 2 97 1 and 61 2 100 respectively on the 143rd day of incubation experiment the concentrations of lpdgt in ow and sediment were reduced by 82 6 100 and 82 9 98 0 respectively after the fh mag combined amendment this implies that the amendment of sediment with the fh mag mixture can effectively cut down the risk of endogenous p release from sediment to ow and pw in anoxic environment although the fh mag mixture addition reduced the concentration of sediment lfedgt there was still a certain concentration of lfedgt present in the sediment layer under the fh mag combined amendment condition fig 9 demonstrating that after the amendment of sediment with the fh mag mixture the release of phosphorus from the fe iii oxides hydroxides to the interstitial water via the microbial reduction of fe iii to fe ii still can occur since fh and mag possess good adsorption performance towards aqueous phosphate fig 2 the fh and mag located in sediment can adsorb the drp in pw after the drp concentration in pw decreased the lpdgt can be released to the pw to compensate the decrease of the drp concentration in the pw however the releasing rate of drp from the sediment solid to increase the concentration of drp in pw should be lower than the rate of drp adsorptive removal from the pw by the fh and mag which brought about the decreased lpdgt concentration in the sediment this further induced the decrease in the molecular diffusion flux of endogenous p from sediment to ow finally giving rise to the decrease of the lpdgt and drp in the ow therefore the immobilization of lpdgt in sediment played a crucial role in the restriction of endogenous p release into ow by the fh mag combined amendment 3 4 effect of fh mag combined capping on p mobilization in sediment the influences of single fh single mag and combined fh mag capping on the p transportation and transformation in sediment ow system were examined by adopting bottles as reactors and the obtained results are presented in figs 5 6 10 and 11 the do concentration of ow under the conditions of no treatment and fh mag combined capping were lower than 0 5 mg l fig 5a demonstrating that the uncapped and capped sediments were maintained in anoxic environments throughout the period of incubation experiment li et al 2022b the ph of ow for the control and capping groups approached to neutral fig 5b the concentrations of drp in ow for the fh mag cs1 cs2 and cs3 capping groups throughout the period of incubation experiment were 0 002 0 028 mg l 0 009 0 028 mg l 0 005 0 026 mg l 0 002 0 023 mg l and 0 003 0 020 mg l respectively which were considerably lower than those for the control group 0 215 0 543 mg l fig 5e the reduction rates of ow drp by the fh mag cs1 cs2 and cs3 capping were 94 2 99 7 89 4 98 0 92 8 99 1 95 2 99 5 and 94 7 99 4 respectively fig 5f these results indicate that under anoxic condition the single fh single mag and combined fh mag capping all can effectively inhibit p release from sediment into ow maintaining low concentrations levels of ow drp as illustrated in fig 6c the sediments collected from the control and capping groups had negligible amount of wa p and capping sediments with fh mag cs1 cs2 and cs3 had a limited on the quantities of r p naoh srp hcl p and res p in the sediments on the whole furthermore the percentages of r p naoh srp hcl p and res p slightly changed after the fh mag cs1 cs2 and cs3 capping on the whole these results demonstrate that the single fh single mag and combined fh mag capping systems have limited immobilization ability for the potential mob p in the sediments as we all know the immobilization of potential mob p in sediment by pisms is conductive to the use of the pisms to control sedimentary p release into ow wang et al 2017b consequently the immobilization of potential mob p in sediment is not the main reason for the restriction of endogenous p release into ow by the single fh single mag and combined fh mag capping evaluating the stability of p immobilized by the capping material is very important to the utilization of the capping method to prevent sedimentary p release into ow as shown in fig 10a and b the fh covering layer contained 3 34 mg kg of wa p 1 39 of tot p 128 mg kg of r p 53 4 of tot p 57 1 mg kg of naoh srp 23 8 of tot p 13 9 mg kg of hcl p 5 80 of tot p and 37 6 mg kg of res p 15 7 of tot p the percentage of mob p to tot p in the fh capping layer was calculated to be 54 8 fig 10e this demonstrates that almost half of p bound to the fh capping layer has a high releasing risk thus after fh is applied as a capping material to intercept endogenous p release it is very necessary to recycle the applied fh from the water bodies for the mag capping layer the amounts of wa p r p naoh srp hcl p and res p were 7 80 49 6 152 11 1 and 50 1 mg kg respectively which accounted for 2 88 18 3 56 2 4 11 and 18 5 of tot p respectively fig 10a and b the percentage of mob p to tot p in the mag capping layer was calculated to be 21 2 fig 10e this demonstrates that around 22 of p immobilized by the mag capping layer can be easily released into sediment porewater and overlying water thus making it a phosphorus source for harmful algae growth while most about 78 of p immobilized by the mag capping layer will make a minor contribution to the flux of endogenous p release to ow in common ph 5 9 or anoxic environment consequently from the point of view of the stability of the p immobilization product the use of mag as an active covering material for hindering the endogenous p release into ow is better than that of fh the distribution pattern of p fractions in the fh mag combined capping layer was related to its construction way fig 10c and d for the cs1 capping system the concentrations of wa p r p naoh srp hcl p and res p were 3 90 11 1 62 0 16 7 and 57 1 mg kg respectively and their percentages in the total extractable p were 2 59 7 39 41 1 11 1 and 37 9 respectively the percentage of mob p to tot p in the cs1 capping system was calculated to be 10 0 fig 10e thus most around 90 of p bound to the cs1 capping system exists in the form of relatively or very stable p and only a small percentage about 10 of p has a high risk of release into pw and ow under anoxic conditions the cs2 capping system contained 4 87 mg kg of wa p 3 56 of tot p 49 0 mg kg of r p 35 8 of tot p 42 8 mg kg of naoh srp 31 3 of tot p 7 66 mg kg of hcl p 5 60 of tot p and 32 4 mg kg of res p 23 7 of tot p respectively and the cs3 capping system contained 6 68 mg kg of wa p 4 02 of tot p 30 6 mg kg of r p 18 4 of tot p 63 0 mg kg of naoh srp 37 9 of tot p 8 70 mg kg of hcl p 5 24 of tot p and 57 1 mg kg of res p 34 4 of tot p respectively fig 10c and d the ratios of mob p to tot p in the cs2 and cs3 capping systems were calculated to be 39 4 and 22 5 respectively fig 10e therefore about 40 and 23 of p immobilized by the cs2 and cs3 capping systems have a high releasing risk under anoxic conditions respectively obviously the stability of p immobilized to the cs1 capping system was much higher than those by the cs2 and cs3 capping systems and it was also much higher than those by the single fh and mag capping systems thus the cs1 capping system i e fabric wrapped fh mag mixture capping system is more suitably used to restrict the release of endogenous p into ow than the single fh single mag cs2 and cs3 capping systems from the standpoint of the stability of the p immobilization product in addition knowing the change of mineral phases in the capping layers after the application of fh and mag is also critical to the use of fh and mag as capping materials to restrain the release of internal p to ow fig 11 presents the xrd patterns of fh and mag after their application to control sedimentary p release as shown in fig 11a the fh at the end of incubation experiment was two line ferrihydrite with two typical broad peaks at 2θ of 34 4 and 61 2 lu et al 2023 this indicates that the mineral phase of fh does not change after about two months application as shown in fig 11b the xrd spectrum of the mag at the end of incubation experiment was basically consistent with that of pure magnetite chang et al 2021 this demonstrates that after about two months application there is no crystal phase transition of mag the influence of fh mag combined capping on p transportation and transformation in sediment ow system was studied by adopting columns as reactors and the obtained results are listed in figs 7 9 during the whole experimental process the sediment cores in the control and covering columns were kept in anoxic environments fig 7a the ow ph for the control and capping columns approached to neutral fig 7b the concentrations of drp in ow for the fh mag combined capping columns were considerably less when compared to those for the control column fig 7c the reduction rates of ow drp by the direct and fabric wrapped fh mag mixture capping were in the ranges of 76 7 98 2 and 66 7 94 4 respectively fig 7d this demonstrates that the direct and fabric wrapped fh mag mixture capping both can effectively restrict the release of endogenous p from sediment to ow under anoxic conditions generally the variation of lpdgt in ow can be applied to reflect the variation of ow drp concentration qu et al 2023 the concentrations of ow lpdgt under the direct fh mag mixture capping condition were significantly lower than those under no treatment condition fig 8a and c the reduction rates of ow lpdgt by the direct fh mag mixture capping on the 75th day ranged from 32 0 to 91 1 with the average lpdgt reduction efficiency of 66 3 fig 8b the removal rates of ow lpdgt by the direct fh mag mixture capping on the 143rd day were between 66 7 and 100 with the mean lpdgt elimination rate of 85 9 fig 8d this further confirms that the release of endogenous p from sediment into ow under anoxic conditions can be effectively suppressed by the fh mag mixture capping to illustrate the mechanism that governs the control of sediment p liberation into ow by the fh mag combined capping it is very necessary to study the effect of direct fh mag mixture capping on the vertical distributions of lpdgt and lfedgt in sediment after the capping of sediment with the fh mag mixture the concentrations of lpdgt in the upper sediment obviously decreased fig 8a and c on the 75th day the elimination efficiencies of lpdgt in the 0 26 mm sediment by the direct fh mag mixture capping were in the range of 64 7 89 9 fig 8b the removal efficiencies of lpdgt in the 0 46 mm sediment by the direct fh mag mixture capping on the 143rd day were between 75 3 and 98 6 fig 8d this suggests that the fh mag mixture capping can effectively immobilize the lpdgt in the upper sediment on the 75th day the fh mag mixture capping had a small or no effect on the lfedgt concentration in the sediment layer on the whole fig 9 on the 143rd day although the fh mag mixture capping gave rise to the decreased concentration of lfedgt in the sediment layer on the whole there was still a certain concentration level of lfedgt in the sediment profile fig 9 the presence of lfedgt in the sediment profile for the combined capping column fig 9 demonstrates that under the condition of fh mag mixture capping p still could be released from sediment into pw via the reductive dissolution of iron iii minerals however the drp in pw can be eliminated by the fh mag mixture capping system because of the phosphate adsorption onto fh and mag which resulted in the decrease of the pw drp concentration after the concentration of pw drp decreased the lpdgt in sediment was migrated into the pw to compensate the decrease of the drp concentration the rate of phosphate adsorption onto fh and mag was larger than that of p release from lpdgt which gave rise to the low lpdgt concentration in the upper sediment this further induced the low molecular diffusion flux of p from the upper sediment to the overlying water which led to the low concentration of drp and lpdgt in the overlying water thus the inactivation of lpdgt in the upper sediment played a significant role in the interception of endogenous p liberation from sediment into ow under anoxic conditions by the fh mag mixture capping 3 5 effect of fh mag combined amendment and capping on microorganisms in sediment microorganisms play an irreplaceable role in the cycle processes of phosphorus in water bodies chen et al 2019a yin et al 2023 the bacterial community diversity of sediments from the control amendment and capping columns is shown in table 2 as presented in table 2 the sequencing depth of sediments in the control amendment and capping columns was enough due to the fact that the coverage was more than 97 this indicates that the sequencing results completely represent the structural characteristics of the bacterial community of the sediments in the control amendment and capping columns the fh mag combined amendment decreased the ace and chao values table 2 after the addition of the fh mag mixture into sediment the value of shannon index decreased but the value of simpson index increased table 2 the bacterial richness can be reflected by the chao and ace indexes li et al 2022a the larger chao and ace indexes mean the higher bacterial richness li et al 2022a the shannon index is a reflection of the species diversity and the larger the value of shannon index the greater the bacterial community diversity wang et al 2022b the simpson index also reflects the bacterial diversity li et al 2022a however the larger the simpson index is the lower the microbial diversity is li et al 2022a thus the microbial richness and diversity of sediment were reduced by the fh mag combined amendment it should be noted that after the fh mag mixture amendment the values of shannon ace and chao decreased by 1 0 12 1 and 12 2 respectively and the value of simpson increased by 4 8 table 2 this demonstrates that the fh mag combined amendment did not produce a large effect on the richness and diversity of bacterial community in the sediment the fh mag mixture capping had no impact on the shannon value but increased the simpson value table 2 in addition the ace and chao values rose after the fh mag mixture capping table 2 these results imply that sediment capping with the fh mag mixture can decrease the diversity of bacterial community in the sediment but can increase the richness of bacterial community in the sediment it should be noted that after sediment capping with the fh mag mixture the values of simpson ace and chao increased by only 4 3 3 9 and 3 1 respectively this suggests that the fh mag mixture capping did not produce a large effect on the diversity and richness of bacterial community in the sediment the venn diagram of outs of microbes in the sediments from the control amendment and capping columns is presented in fig 12 as shown in fig 12 3970 otus were common key species that were observed in the sediments under no treatment and fh mag combined amendment the unique otus made up of 19 5 and 15 9 of the total species in the control and fh mag combined amendment columns respectively this demonstrates that the fh mag combined amendment has a certain impact on the core bacteria in the sediment it can also be seen from fig 12 that the numbers of sediment otus in the control and covering columns were 4931 and 5056 respectively which indicates that the fh mag mixture capping can increase the total number of sediment otus furthermore the number of the common otus in the control and capping columns was 4229 accounting for 85 8 and 83 6 of the total sediment otus in the control and capping columns respectively this means that the fh mag mixture capping has a certain effect on the core bacteria in the sediment fig 13 a shows the relative abundance of bacterial taxa at phylum level in the sediments from the control amendment and capping columns as shown in fig 13a at the phylum level the main bacterial community of the sediments in the control amendment and capping columns were chloroflexi proteobacteria firmicutes actinobacteriota acidobacteriota and desulfobacterota etc previous researches have shown that chloroflexi can decompose organic matter and release inorganic phosphorus chang et al 2020 shao et al 2023 sulfate reducing microorganism srm possesses the ability of reducing sulfate to form hydrogen sulfide niu et al 2021 gao et al found that the main phyla of dsrb containing srm were proteobacteria firmicutes and acidobacteriota gao et al 2022a proteobacteria phylum is a very diverse group of bacteria and some of them belong to srm yin et al 2021 members of the phylum desulfobacterota are mostly srm watanabe et al 2022 the reduction of sulfate to hydrogen sulfide helps maintain anoxic conditions yin et al 2021 an extensively accepted view is that anoxic environments are beneficial to r p release from sediment gao et al 2016 hu et al 2022 kong et al 2021 in addition sulfide can chemically reduce the iron and manganese oxides hydroxides in sediments which results in the release of r p yao et al 2022 yin et al observed that some organic phosphorus solubilizing bacteria are classified as proteobacteria phylum yin et al 2022 liang et al observed that the microbial dissimilatory iron reduction which makes a vital contribution to the transportation and transformation of p in sediment often linked to the bacterial family geobacteraceae proteobacteria liang et al 2022a chen et al observed that actinobacteriota was the dominant phylum of phosphorus mineralizing bacteria chen et al 2019a therefore the presence of chloroflexi proteobacteria firmicutes actinobacteriota acidobacteriota and desulfobacterota in the sediments of control amendment and capping columns may decrease the redox potential of the sediments and convert some insoluble p into soluble p thus resulting in the endogenous p release from the sediment into the interstitial water under the conditions of no treatment fh mag combined amendment and fh mag combined capping fig 13b shows the relative abundance of bacterial taxa at genus level in the sediments from the control amendment and capping columns as shown in fig 13b the major bacterial genera in the sediments of the control amendment and capping columns included bacillus and desulfatiglans the bacteria belonged to bacillus has the ability to promote the reduction of iron iii oxides hydroxides to soluble iron ii species han et al 2022 meng et al 2021 the presence of bacillus in the sediments of the control amendment and capping columns indicates that the reductive dissolution of fe iii minerals driven by microorganisms should take place thus the microbial reductive dissolution of phosphorus loaded fe iii minerals is a mechanism responsible for endogenous phosphorus release from sediment into pw under the conditions of no treatment fh mag combined amendment and fh mag combined capping desulfatiglans were sulfate reducing bacteria yi et al 2021 the presence of desulfatiglans in the sediments of the control amendment and capping columns means that the reduction of sulfate to sulfide driven by sulfate reducing bacteria should take place therefore the sulfide mediated chemical iron iii reduction scir may be another mechanism that dominates the release of endogenous p from sediment to pw under the conditions of no treatment fh mag combined amendment and fh mag combined capping 3 6 implication for practical application and future research this work concluded that the fh mag mixture addition and capping had a good performance for the restriction of endogenous p release from sediment to ow in anoxic state furthermore the fh mag mixture addition and capping cannot increase the risk of iron release from sediment in addition the fh mag mixture addition and capping can only have a certain effect on the richness and diversity of bacterial community and the core bacteria in the sediment thus taking into account the controlling efficiency and environmental friendliness the utilization of fh mag mixture as an active covering or amendment material has a great potential in the restriction of endogenous p liberation from sediment into ow sediment capping is easy to be achieved by spraying the capping material on the sediment ow interface abel et al 2017 however sediment amendment generally needs a special mechanical device to mix the sediment with the amendment material abel et al 2017 therefore taking into account the application convenience the use of fh mag mixture as an active capping material to suppress the liberation of endogenous p from sediment to ow is better than that as an amendment material after capping sediment with the fh mag mixture the applied mag may be recycled from the water body under the action of an external magnetic field such as a magnet funes et al 2016 funes et al 2017b however the applied fh is generally hard to be recycled from the water body in addition if no measure is adopted to protect the powdery fh mag mixture the mixing of the fh mag mixture with the sediment should occur under the actions of strong bioturbation and hydrodynamic disturbance this makes the recycling of the applied mag become very difficult if the p loaded fh mag mixture still remains in place the fh mag mixture bound p may be released into pw and ow when future environmental condition changes funes et al 2016 funes et al 2017b what s more the permanent placement of the fh mag mixture in the water body will result in the waste of fe resource therefore it is very necessary to take appropriate measures to take the fh and mag back from the water body after the fh mag combined capping previous studies have shown that it is a feasible method to use the permeable fabric to protect the capping layer from being damaged gu et al 2017 lin et al 2020a qu et al 2023 the active capping system constructed by wrapping magnetic pism with permeable fabric possesses magnetism and it can be easy to be recycled from the water body with the help of an external magnetism field such as magnet lin et al 2020a lin and chen 2021 qu et al 2023 in addition the active capping system based on fabric also can be recycled by lifting huang et al 2023 thus the use of the permeable fabric to wrap the fh mag mixture to form the recyclable active capping system not only can prevent the destruction of the powdery fh mag mixture covering layer by strong hydrodynamic and biological disturbance but also can make the capping material easy to be recycled from the water body with the help of an external magnetic field or lifting furthermore it is easy to construct the recyclable active capping system by wrapping the fh mag mixture with the permeable fabric thus the fabric wrapped fh mag mixture capping is a promising strategy for intercepting the release of endogenous p from sediment into ow due to its advantages of high controlling efficiency environmental friendliness application convenience and sustainability in this study there are still some aspects that need to be improved and explored first the efficiency of fabric wrapped fh mag mixture capping to control p release from sediment in real environment needs to be further studied second natural magnetite is considered as a readily available and low cost iron mineral because of its abundance in nature hu et al 2020a jiang and zhu 2021 therefore the substitution of natural magnetite for artificial magnetite to construct the fabric wrapped fh mag capping systems may be feasible however this needs to be further studied moreover higher h m po4 m 3 adsorption capacity commonly is favorable for the use of pisms to control the internal release to ow spears et al 2013 thus in order to better apply fh and mag to control p release from sediment modifying fh and mag to increase their h m po4 m 3 adsorption capacity is still necessary 4 conclusions 1 the fh mag combined amendment effectively hindered the liberation of endogenous p from sediment into ow under anoxic condition and the immobilization of lpdgt and mob p in the sediment played a key role in the suppression of endogenous p release by the fh mag combined amendment 2 combined capping sediment with fh and mag effectively hindered the release of endogenous p from sediment to ow and the immobilization of lpdgt in the upper sediment played a key part in the control of sediment p liberation by the fh mag mixture capping the stability of p bound by the fh mag combined capping layer was related to its construction way and most around 90 of p bound to the fh mag mixture has a low releasing risk under common ph 5 9 and anoxic conditions 3 the fh mag mixture amendment and capping not only did not increase the risk of iron release from sediment and but also did not produce a large impact on the diversity and richness of bacterial community in the sediment 4 the combined use of fh and mag as a composite amendment or capping material to prevent sediment p release into ow can make full use of their respective advantages 5 the permeable fabric wrapped fh mag mixture capping is a

14911,this study developed novel active capping systems with recycling convenience using ferrihydrite fh combined with magnetite mag and investigated the effectiveness and mechanism for the restriction of endogenous phosphorus movement from sediment into overlying water ow by the combined use of fh and mag the fh mag combined amendment effectively hindered endogenous phosphorus release from sediment to ow in dissolved oxygen do deficit environment and the immobilization of diffusion gradient in thin film labile phosphorus lpdgt and mobile phosphorus in the sediment played a key role in the control of endogenous phosphorus liberation by the fh mag combined amendment combined capping sediment with fh and mag effectively hindered endogenous phosphorus release from sediment to ow in anoxic environment and the inactivation of lpdgt in the upper sediment played a key part in the control of sediment phosphorus release by the fh mag mixture capping the stability of phosphorus immobilized by the fh mag combined covering layer was related to its construction way and the majority around 90 of p immobilized to the fh mag mixture covering layer had low risk of release in common

2022b xia et al 2022 it should be noted that fe pisms can be classified into two types non magnetic fe pisms nm fe pisms and magnetic fe pisms m fe pisms the fe rich pisms can effectively immobilize p in sediment under aerobic condition via adsorption or precipitation mechanism mucci et al 2018 xia et al 2022 however owing to the microbial reduction of iron iii to iron ii the p adsorbed by the iron iii oxides hydroxides can be migrated into the interstitial and overlying waters under anoxic condition hu et al 2022 kleeberg et al 2013 rapin et al 2019 xia et al 2022 after the application of nm fe pisms the added nm fe pisms are commonly difficult to recycle and the p immobilized by the nm fe pisms that stay in the sediment is possibly moved into the interstitial and overlying waters in the end if the redox condition changes from oxic condition to anoxic condition funes et al 2017b thus the long term effectiveness of nm fe pisms to immobilize p in sediment still needs to be further evaluated and the removal of p loaded nm fe pisms from the water body after their application may be very necessary to overcome the drawbacks of nm fe pisms to suppress sediment p liberation the method based on m fe pisms has been put forward de vicente et al 2010 funes et al 2016 funes et al 2017b applying a magnetic separation gradient is a good method to achieve the recovery of the used m fe pisms álvarez manzaneda et al 2019a funes et al 2016 funes et al 2017a funes et al 2017b however if no effective measure is taken to prevent the mixing of the applied m fe pisms with sediment the recovery of the m fe pisms within the sediment will become very difficult therefore it is still very necessary to develop a novel fe pisms based active capping system with recycling convenience for the effective interception of endogenous p liberation in addition to capping amendment is another mode for applying fe pisms to control p release from sediment different fe pisms may have different performances for p immobilization in sediment the combined use of different fe pisms as a composite amendment may make use of their respective advantages to prevent sediment p release ferrihydrite fh and magnetite mag are typical nm fe pism and m fe pism for sedimentary p liberation respectively chen et al 2021b zou et al 2017 the main objectives of this work were i to develop novel active capping systems with recycling convenience using fh combined with mag and ii to explore the effectiveness and mechanism for the control of endogenous p release by the combined use of fh and mag as active capping and amendment materials to this end batch adsorption experiment and x ray photoelectron spectra xps analysis were applied to study the performance and mechanism of phosphate h m po4 m 3 m 0 1 2 or 3 adsorption onto fh and mag at first and then the effects of combined amendment and capping using fh and mag on the p transportation and transformation in sediment water system were explored by adopting sediment incubation experiments the findings from this study could be used to guide a new development of fh mag combined amendment and capping methods for sediment p release and eutrophication management 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the sediment used in this work was collected using a grab sampler from an artificial scenic fresh water body which is located in

acquired by a smartlab9 x ray diffraction spectrometer riken corporation japan the broad scan and narrow scan xps spectra of fh and mag samples before and after h m po4 m 3 adsorption were collected through an escalab 250xi x ray photoelectron spectrometer which was supplied by thermo fisher scientific usa the narrow scan xps spectra were fitted using xpspeak41 software and the shirley background was applied han et al 2012 the lorentzian gaussian ratio was fixed at 30 2 3 adsorption experiment adsorption equilibrium experiments were performed in a shaker with 25 c at 150 rpm for twenty four hours to determine the impact of coexisting electrolyte upon h m po4 m 3 adsorption onto fh or mag 25 mg of fh or mag was introduced into 25 ml of h m po4 m 3 solutions without and with coexisting electrolyte ph 7 0 respectively for the coexisting electrolyte effect study the initial concentration of phosphorus was specified at 20 mg l and the initial coexisting electrolyte nacl nahco3 na2so4 kcl cacl2 or mgcl2 concentration was specified at 2 mmol l the effect of initial h m po4 m 3 concentration on h m po4 m 3 uptake by fh was studied by mixing 25 mg of fh with 25 ml of h m po4 m 3 solutions without and with the simultaneous existence of common cations and anions initial phosphorus concentrations 5 10 15 20 25 and 30 mg l ph 7 0 respectively the effect of initial h m po4 m 3

transformation in sediment water system were explored by adopting 250 ml wide mouth brown reagent bottle as sediment incubation reactor eighteen bottles containing 20 g of air dried sediment were applied and these bottles were randomly separated into nine groups two bottles were contained in each group nine groups were suffered from the following treatments respectively 1 control group no treatment 2 fh amendment group 2 g 3 mag amendment group 2 g 4 fh mag combined amendment group 1 g of fh 1 g of mag 5 fabric fc wrapped fh capping group 2 g 6 fabric wrapped mag capping group 2 g 7 fabric wrapped fh mag mixture capping group cs1 1 g of fh 1 g of mag 8 combined capping group with fabric wrapped mag capping at first and then fabric wrapped fh capping cs2 1 g of fh 1 g of mag 9 combined capping group with fabric wrapped fh capping at first and then fabric wrapped mag capping cs3 1 g of fh 1 g of mag fig s1 the role of fc in the fc wrapped capping system was to prevent the mixing of sediment with the capping material qu et al 2023 wu et al 2022a the natural water was deoxygenated by the na2so3 oxygenation method kim et al 2003 the concentration of dissolved oxygen do in the deoxygenated water was 0 5 mg l after the deoxygenated water was prepared it was slowly siphoned into all the bottles until the free space above the sediment was full of water to make the sediment in anoxic environment rubber plugs were applied to close all the bottles during incubation period the do concentration and ph value of ow were monitored at regular intervals with portable do and ph analyzers respectively after each measurement of do and ph the ow samples were taken by a syringe to monitor the concentration of dissolved soluble p drp with the molybdenum blue method lan et al 2022 on the 63rd day of incubation the sediment and covering material were collected after air drying the as obtained samples were ground through a 0 150 mm sieve to analyze phosphorus forms the p forms in the sediment and capping material were classified into weakly adsorbed phosphorus wa p extracted with ammonium chloride reducible phosphorus r p extracted with bicarbonate dithionite bd phosphorus bound to metal oxide hydroxide naoh srp extracted with naoh at 298 k calcium magnesium bound phosphorus hcl p extracted with hcl and residual phosphorus res p extracted with naoh at 358 k lin et al 2019 rydin 2000 after each extraction step the sediment and covering material samples were centrifuged afterwards the supernatant was filtered by 0 45 µm filter membrane after that the concentration of drp in the filtrate was detected with the molybdenum antimony anti spectrophotometry method gao et al 2022b finally the percentages of different p forms to the total p tot p were calculated the xrd patterns of fh and mag after their application were acquired by a smartlab9 x ray diffraction spectrometer riken corporation japan the impacts of combined amendment and covering on the p transportation and transformation in sediment water system were further researched using column with 10 cm of inner diameter and 27 cm of height as sediment incubation reactor the fresh wet sediment from the sampling site was placed into the column until the sediment depth attained 100 mm then we divided eight columns into four groups at random and two columns were included in each group four groups were suffered from the following treatments respectively 1 control group no treatment 2 fh mag combined amendment group 4 g of fh 4 g of mag 3 fh mag mixture capping group 4 g of fh 4 g of mag cs1 without fabric wrapping 4 fabric wrapped fh mag mixture capping group 4 g of fh 4 g of mag cs1 with fabric wrapping fig s2 after the natural water was deoxygenated by the na2so3 oxygenation method kim et al 2003 it was slowly siphoned into all the reactors to fill the free space above the sediment after the water level arrived at the mouth of the column rubber plugs were applied to close all the columns during incubation period the do and ph of ow were detected at regular intervals with portable do and ph analyzers respectively after the measurements of do and ph the ow samples were taken through a syringe and filtered through 0 45 µm filter membrane the drp concentration of ow was detected with the ascorbic acid molybate spectrophotometric method markovic et al 2019 on 75 and 143 days of incubation zrochelex dgt devices were vertically inserted into the sediments in the control combined amendment and direct combined capping reactors after twenty four hours we retrieved the zrochelex dgt devices from the sediments the dgt gels were cut into slices at 2 mm intervals then the obtained slices were immersed in 400 µl of 1 mol l hno3 and 400 µl of 1 mol l naoh solutions respectively chen et al 2019b after elution the concentrations of drp and fe2 in the eluent were detected with the molybdenum blue and phenanthroline colorimetric methods respectively chen et al 2019b the concentrations of dgt labile p lpdgt and dgt labile fe lfedgt in the sediment and overlying water were calculated according to the established method chen et al 2019b on the 168th day of incubation the sediments in the control combined amendment and combined capping reactors were sampled and analyzed using high throughput sequencing based on an illumina miseq platform the concrete steps for the sediment microbial community analysis have been described in the previous literature wu et al 2022a 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of fh and mag fig 1 presents the xrd patters of fh and mag as depicted in fig 1a the as synthesized fh sample showed two typical broad peaks at around 34 and 61 of 2θ indicative of weakly crystallized ferrihydrite like phase this is consistent with the results previously reported liang et al 2021 liang et al 2022b zhang et al 2019 the major characteristic peaks in the xrd pattern of mag fig 1b were in line with the standard pattern of pure magnetite lee and kim 2022 shahid et al 2019 this demonstrates that the as prepared mag sample is mainly composed of magnetite 3 2 adsorption of phosphate on fh and mag the effect of coexisting electrolyte on h m po4 m 3 adsorption onto fh and mag is presented in fig 2 a as fig 2a seen the introduction of na k cl and so4 2 had a negligible impact on the h m po4 m 3 adsorption onto fh and mag however coexisting ca2 and mg2 both improved the uptake of h m po4 m 3 by fh and mag in contrast to the influence of ca2 and mg2 coexisting hco3 suppressed the adsorption of h m po4 m 3 on fh and mag commonly the uptake of h m po4 m 3 by metal oxides hydroxides is dominated by the balance of outer sphere and inter sphere complexes chen et al 2022 su et al 2013 generally the h m po4 m 3 adsorption due to the outer sphere complexation is sensitive to the change of ionic strength chen et al 2022 su et al 2013 however the adsorption of h m po4 m 3 due to the inner sphere complexation is insensitive to the change in ionic strength or enhanced by the increase in the ionic strength chen et al 2022 su et al 2013 the limited effects of nacl kcl and na2so4 on the h m po4 m 3 adsorption onto fh and mag imply that the adsorption obeys the inner sphere complexing mechanism in the absence of coexisting electrolyte the inner sphere iron phosphate binary complexes e g fe opo oh 2 fe opo o2h and feo 2 po oh will be formed liu et al 2020 xiong et al 2017 the promoting effects of ca2 and mg2 are explained as follows coexisting ca2 and mg2 can react with h m po4 m 3 to form cahpo4 and mghpo4 lin et al 2020b iron oxide can adsorb cahpo4 and mghpo4 to generate the hpo4 2 bridged ternary surface complexes i e fe opo3h ca and fe opo3h mg antelo et al 2015 lin et al 2020b liu et al 2020 yu et al 2022 compared to the free phosphate anions the formed cahpo4 and mghpo4 are easy to be adsorbed by fh and mag lin et al 2020b this gives rise to the enhancement of h m po4 m 3 adsorption onto fh and mag by the existence of ca2 or mg2 the inhibitory effect of hco3 on the h m po4 m 3 adsorption onto fh and mag is due to the competition of hco3 with h m po4 m 3 for the adsorption active sites on the surfaces of adsorbents afridi et al 2019 peng et al 2022 the adsorption isotherms of h m po4 m 3 on fh and mag without and with the simultaneous presence of common anions and cations are displayed in fig 2b and c respectively in the range of tested initial phosphate p concentration the amounts of bound h m po4 m 3 on fh and mag increased with the increase of equilibrium phosphate p concentration until adsorption equilibrium was achieved or continuously increased with the rise of equilibrium phosphate p concentration fig 2b and c furthermore the simultaneous presence of common anions cl hco3 and so4 2 and cations na k ca2 and mg2 greatly promoted the adsorption of h m po4 m 3 on fh and mag which was mainly ascribed to the promotive effects of ca2 and mg2 on the uptake of h m po4 m 3 by fh and mag table 1 summarizes the relevant isotherm model parameters it was concluded from table 1 that the langmuir isotherm model r 2 0 941 0 959 can better describe the h m po4 m 3 adsorption onto fh than the freundlich isotherm model r 2 0 895 0 907 while the latter r 2 0 920 0 943 can better describe the h m po4 m 3 adsorption onto mag than the former r 2 0 571 0 762 the maximum h m po4 m 3 adsorption capacity for fh in the simultaneous presence of common anions and cations 22 5 mg g was remarkably greater than that in the simultaneous absence of common anions and cations 14 4 mg g the k f value for mag with the simultaneous existence of common anions and cations was significantly higher than that in the simultaneous absence of common anions and cations these results further confirm the improvement of h m po4 m 3 adsorption onto fh and mag by the simultaneous presence of common anions and cations in addition in the simultaneous absence of common anions and cations the maximum adsorption capacity of fh towards h m po4 m 3 was remarkably larger than that of mag there was a similar phenomenon in the simultaneous presence of common anions and cations thus from the standpoint of the phosphate adsorption capacity fh is more suitable as an adsorbent for h m po4 m 3 elimination from water than mag the underlying mechanism for h m po4 m 3 adsorption onto fh and mag in the simultaneous absence of common anions and cations has been extensively studied arai and sparks 2001 fu et al 2018 lee and kim 2022 liu et al 2018 liu et al 2021 mallet et al 2013 the substitution of fe oh group with h m po4 m 3 to form the inner sphere iron phosphate binary complex is a crucial mechanism for the adsorptive removal of h m po4 m 3 by fh and mag in the simultaneous absence of common anions and cations arai and sparks 2001 fu et al 2018 lee and kim 2022 liu et al 2018 liu et al 2021 mallet et al 2013 in order to elucidate the mechanism for the uptake of h m po4 m 3 by fh and mag in the simultaneous presence of common anions and cations the xps analyses on the original and h m po4 m 3 adsorbed fh and mag samples were performed and the results are given in figs 3 and 4 the wide scan xps spectra of the raw fh and mag samples indicated the simultaneous presence of iron and oxygen elements in the as prepared fh and mag figs 3a and 4a the fe 2p spectrum for the raw fh fig 3b shows the characteristic peaks of fe 2p1 2 and fe 2p3 2 at binding energy be of 724 66 ev and 710 98 ev respectively the fe 2p spectrum for the p loaded fh fig 3b shows the characteristic peaks of fe 2p1 2 and fe 2p3 2 at be of 724 66 ev and 710 92 ev respectively this indicates that the fe in the as prepared fh exists in the form of iron oxide peng et al 2022 the high resolution xps spectra of fe 2p for the raw and p loaded mag samples fig 4b show that the fe in the as prepared mag exists in the form of iron oxide peng et al 2022 the be values of p 2p1 2 and p 2p3 2 peaks for the p loaded fh were found to be 133 95 ev and 133 23 ev respectively fig 3c and those for the p loaded mag were determined to be 134 01 ev and 133 07 ev respectively fig 4c these values were higher when compared to the be value of p 2p peak for the adsorbed phosphate through the electrostatic attraction mechanism i e 131 9 ev dong et al 2017 and the be value of p 2p peak for the nah2po4 2h2o reference salt i e 132 9 ev mallet et al 2013 this demonstrates the formation of inner sphere iron phosphate binary surface complex after the uptake of h m po4 m 3 by fh and mag the o 1 s peak for the raw fh and mag can be separated into three overlapped peaks which match up to lattice oxygen derived from fe o ol iron bound hydroxyl group oh and adsorbed water ow after h m po4 m 3 adsorption the percentage of oh decreased suggesting that hydroxyl group was involved in the adsorption process of h m po4 m 3 on fh and mag considering the results discussed above it was proposed that the underlying mechanism for h m po4 m 3 adsorption onto fh and mag in the simultaneous presence of common anions and cations was the exchange of fe oh groups with the phosphate species in water to form the inner sphere iron phosphate complexes and the formed inner sphere iron phosphate complexes not only included the inner sphere iron phosphate binary complexes e g fe opo oh 2 fe opo o2h and feo 2 po oh but also included the phosphate bridged fe p ca and fe p mg ternary complexes e g fe opo3h ca and fe opo3h mg 3 3 effect of fh mag combined amendment on p mobilization in sediment the influences of single fh single mag and fh mag combined amendments on the transport and transformation of p in the system of sediment and ow were explored by adopting bottles as reactors and the obtained results are presented in figs 5 and 6 do and ph are important environmental parameters that dominate the transportation and transformation of p in ow sediment system chen et al 2021a as seen in fig 5a the overlying waters in the control and amendment reactors were maintained under the anoxic condition li et al 2022b as fig 5b depicts the overlying waters in the control and amendment reactors had near neutral ph values it is obvious that the amendments of sediments with fh mag and their mixture produce a limited effect on the ow ph during 14 63 days incubation the drp concentrations of ow in the control reactor were 0 215 0 543 mg l fig 5c in addition with the rise of incubation from 14 to 28 days and from 42 to 56 days the drp concentration of ow in the control reactor increased fig 5c these results indicate that if no control measure is taken a large quantity of endogenous p can be released from sediment to ow under anoxic conditions a widely accepted opinion is that under anoxic environments the reduction of fe iii minerals to soluble fe ii species driven by fe reducing microorganisms takes place and the p associated to the fe iii minerals is released to ow gao et al 2016 hu et al 2022 kong et al 2021 the concentration of drp in ow under the amendment condition was obviously lower than that under no amendment condition fig 5c the concentration of drp in ow decreased by 94 7 99 5 94 7 99 1 and 96 2 100 after the amendments of sediments with single fh single mag and their mixture respectively fig 5d these results demonstrate that single fh single mag and their mixture all can be used as sediment amendments to effectively hinder sedimentary p liberation into ow under the anoxic condition the risk of endogenous p release from sediment is closely linked to its fractionation rydin 2000 wen et al 2020 yang et al 2022 wa p stands for the weakly immobilized p and it is unstable rydin 2000 wen et al 2020 r p is referred to the reductant soluble p associated to iron and manganese oxides hydroxides and it has high releasing risk under the anoxic condition rydin 2000 wen et al 2020 both wa p and r p belong to the potential mobile p mob p meis et al 2012 naoh srp is conventionally regarded as a relatively stable p sink and this p species is insensitive to redox potential change yang et al 2022 hcl p is the relatively stable fraction of p and it is only liberated under low ph conditions rydin 2000 wen et al 2020 yang et al 2022 res p represents the most stable p fraction and has the lowest risk of release wen et al 2020 the sediments in the control and amendment reactors had a very limited quantity of wa p fig 6a after the amendments of sediments with fh mag and their mixture the concentrations of r p and hcl p in the sediment decreased but the quantities of naoh srp and res p in the sediment increased fig 6a obviously the amount of mob p in sediment decreased after the single fh single mag and fh mag combined amendments this demonstrates that the uses of fh mag and their mixture as amendments all can decrease the risk of sedimentary p liberation it can be inferred from fig 6b that the reduction of potential mob p in sediment by the fh mag and their mixture additions is mainly due to the fact that the p form is transformed from r p to naoh srp and res p it should be noted that although the percentage of mob p in the mag amended sediment was basically same to that in the fh amended sediment the percentage of res p to tot p in the former was much higher than that in the latter fig 6b this demonstrates that from the point of view of the p speciation conversion the utilization of mag as an amendment material to inactivate the endogenous p in sediment is better than that of fh considering that fh exhibited much higher h m po4 m 3 adsorption capacity than mag the combined use of fh and mag as a composite amendment material to inactivate the endogenous p in sediment can make full use of their respective advantages the endogenous p release from sediment has a close association with the concentration of mob p rydin 2000 tammeorg et al 2022 therefore the reduction of mob p in sediment was critical to the restriction of endogenous p liberation into ow by the combined fh mag combined amendment the influence of fh mag combined amendment on the transport and transformation of phosphorus in sediment ow system was further explored using columns as reactors and the obtained results are given in figs 7 9 the sediments in the control and amendment columns were incubated under anoxic conditions fig 7a the ow ph in the control and fh mag combined amendment columns approached to neutral fig 7b however the fh mag combined amendment slightly increased the ph value of ow this may be owed to the ligand exchange of fh mag bound hydroxyl fe oh group with h m po4 m 3 resulting in the release of oh from fh and mag as illustrated in fig 7c as the incubation time rose the concentration of drp in ow under no treatment condition increased till a maximum value was achieved on the whole further indicating that a large quantity of p in sediment is easily migrated to ow under anoxic conditions the drp concentrations of ow in the fh mag combined amendment column were 0 004 0 030 mg l the reduction rates of drp in ow by the fh mag combined amendment were 83 0 97 5 this further indicates that the fh mag combined amendment can effectively hinder the release of endogenous phosphorus from sediment to ow under anoxic conditions the process of sediment p migrated into ow generally includes two basic sub processes ding et al 2015 one is the liberation of endogenous p from sediment to the pore water pw ding et al 2015 the other is the molecular diffusion of soluble p from pw to ow across the sediment ow interface ding et al 2015 dgt technique can be used to study the dynamic process of endogenous p transport from sediment to ow chen et al 2019b chen et al 2015 ding et al 2015 yin et al 2022 lpdgt can be a good reflection of the ability for the release of mob p from sediment to pw and the potential for the migration of mob p from sediment to ow yin et al 2022 on the 75th and 143rd days of incubation experiment there was a certain concentration of lpdgt in the ow sediment profile under no treatment condition fig 8 furthermore the concentration of lpdgt in sediment was equal to or higher than that in ow on the whole fig 8 in addition a high concentration of lfedgt was found in the sediment profile under no treatment condition after 75 and 143 days incubation fig 9 these results confirm that under anoxic conditions phosphorus can be liberated from sediment into pw through fe p coupling mechanism and the dgt measured labile p can be further migrated into ow the concentration of lpdgt in ow and sediment under fh mag combined amendment condition was significantly lower than that under the condition of no treatment fig 8 the removal rates of lpdgt in ow and sediment by the fh mag combined amendment on the 75th day of incubation were found to be 30 2 97 1 and 61 2 100 respectively on the 143rd day of incubation experiment the concentrations of lpdgt in ow and sediment were reduced by 82 6 100 and 82 9 98 0 respectively after the fh mag combined amendment this implies that the amendment of sediment with the fh mag mixture can effectively cut down the risk of endogenous p release from sediment to ow and pw in anoxic environment although the fh mag mixture addition reduced the concentration of sediment lfedgt there was still a certain concentration of lfedgt present in the sediment layer under the fh mag combined amendment condition fig 9 demonstrating that after the amendment of sediment with the fh mag mixture the release of phosphorus from the fe iii oxides hydroxides to the interstitial water via the microbial reduction of fe iii to fe ii still can occur since fh and mag possess good adsorption performance towards aqueous phosphate fig 2 the fh and mag located in sediment can adsorb the drp in pw after the drp concentration in pw decreased the lpdgt can be released to the pw to compensate the decrease of the drp concentration in the pw however the releasing rate of drp from the sediment solid to increase the concentration of drp in pw should be lower than the rate of drp adsorptive removal from the pw by the fh and mag which brought about the decreased lpdgt concentration in the sediment this further induced the decrease in the molecular diffusion flux of endogenous p from sediment to ow finally giving rise to the decrease of the lpdgt and drp in the ow therefore the immobilization of lpdgt in sediment played a crucial role in the restriction of endogenous p release into ow by the fh mag combined amendment 3 4 effect of fh mag combined capping on p mobilization in sediment the influences of single fh single mag and combined fh mag capping on the p transportation and transformation in sediment ow system were examined by adopting bottles as reactors and the obtained results are presented in figs 5 6 10 and 11 the do concentration of ow under the conditions of no treatment and fh mag combined capping were lower than 0 5 mg l fig 5a demonstrating that the uncapped and capped sediments were maintained in anoxic environments throughout the period of incubation experiment li et al 2022b the ph of ow for the control and capping groups approached to neutral fig 5b the concentrations of drp in ow for the fh mag cs1 cs2 and cs3 capping groups throughout the period of incubation experiment were 0 002 0 028 mg l 0 009 0 028 mg l 0 005 0 026 mg l 0 002 0 023 mg l and 0 003 0 020 mg l respectively which were considerably lower than those for the control group 0 215 0 543 mg l fig 5e the reduction rates of ow drp by the fh mag cs1 cs2 and cs3 capping were 94 2 99 7 89 4 98 0 92 8 99 1 95 2 99 5 and 94 7 99 4 respectively fig 5f these results indicate that under anoxic condition the single fh single mag and combined fh mag capping all can effectively inhibit p release from sediment into ow maintaining low concentrations levels of ow drp as illustrated in fig 6c the sediments collected from the control and capping groups had negligible amount of wa p and capping sediments with fh mag cs1 cs2 and cs3 had a limited on the quantities of r p naoh srp hcl p and res p in the sediments on the whole furthermore the percentages of r p naoh srp hcl p and res p slightly changed after the fh mag cs1 cs2 and cs3 capping on the whole these results demonstrate that the single fh single mag and combined fh mag capping systems have limited immobilization ability for the potential mob p in the sediments as we all know the immobilization of potential mob p in sediment by pisms is conductive to the use of the pisms to control sedimentary p release into ow wang et al 2017b consequently the immobilization of potential mob p in sediment is not the main reason for the restriction of endogenous p release into ow by the single fh single mag and combined fh mag capping evaluating the stability of p immobilized by the capping material is very important to the utilization of the capping method to prevent sedimentary p release into ow as shown in fig 10a and b the fh covering layer contained 3 34 mg kg of wa p 1 39 of tot p 128 mg kg of r p 53 4 of tot p 57 1 mg kg of naoh srp 23 8 of tot p 13 9 mg kg of hcl p 5 80 of tot p and 37 6 mg kg of res p 15 7 of tot p the percentage of mob p to tot p in the fh capping layer was calculated to be 54 8 fig 10e this demonstrates that almost half of p bound to the fh capping layer has a high releasing risk thus after fh is applied as a capping material to intercept endogenous p release it is very necessary to recycle the applied fh from the water bodies for the mag capping layer the amounts of wa p r p naoh srp hcl p and res p were 7 80 49 6 152 11 1 and 50 1 mg kg respectively which accounted for 2 88 18 3 56 2 4 11 and 18 5 of tot p respectively fig 10a and b the percentage of mob p to tot p in the mag capping layer was calculated to be 21 2 fig 10e this demonstrates that around 22 of p immobilized by the mag capping layer can be easily released into sediment porewater and overlying water thus making it a phosphorus source for harmful algae growth while most about 78 of p immobilized by the mag capping layer will make a minor contribution to the flux of endogenous p release to ow in common ph 5 9 or anoxic environment consequently from the point of view of the stability of the p immobilization product the use of mag as an active covering material for hindering the endogenous p release into ow is better than that of fh the distribution pattern of p fractions in the fh mag combined capping layer was related to its construction way fig 10c and d for the cs1 capping system the concentrations of wa p r p naoh srp hcl p and res p were 3 90 11 1 62 0 16 7 and 57 1 mg kg respectively and their percentages in the total extractable p were 2 59 7 39 41 1 11 1 and 37 9 respectively the percentage of mob p to tot p in the cs1 capping system was calculated to be 10 0 fig 10e thus most around 90 of p bound to the cs1 capping system exists in the form of relatively or very stable p and only a small percentage about 10 of p has a high risk of release into pw and ow under anoxic conditions the cs2 capping system contained 4 87 mg kg of wa p 3 56 of tot p 49 0 mg kg of r p 35 8 of tot p 42 8 mg kg of naoh srp 31 3 of tot p 7 66 mg kg of hcl p 5 60 of tot p and 32 4 mg kg of res p 23 7 of tot p respectively and the cs3 capping system contained 6 68 mg kg of wa p 4 02 of tot p 30 6 mg kg of r p 18 4 of tot p 63 0 mg kg of naoh srp 37 9 of tot p 8 70 mg kg of hcl p 5 24 of tot p and 57 1 mg kg of res p 34 4 of tot p respectively fig 10c and d the ratios of mob p to tot p in the cs2 and cs3 capping systems were calculated to be 39 4 and 22 5 respectively fig 10e therefore about 40 and 23 of p immobilized by the cs2 and cs3 capping systems have a high releasing risk under anoxic conditions respectively obviously the stability of p immobilized to the cs1 capping system was much higher than those by the cs2 and cs3 capping systems and it was also much higher than those by the single fh and mag capping systems thus the cs1 capping system i e fabric wrapped fh mag mixture capping system is more suitably used to restrict the release of endogenous p into ow than the single fh single mag cs2 and cs3 capping systems from the standpoint of the stability of the p immobilization product in addition knowing the change of mineral phases in the capping layers after the application of fh and mag is also critical to the use of fh and mag as capping materials to restrain the release of internal p to ow fig 11 presents the xrd patterns of fh and mag after their application to control sedimentary p release as shown in fig 11a the fh at the end of incubation experiment was two line ferrihydrite with two typical broad peaks at 2θ of 34 4 and 61 2 lu et al 2023 this indicates that the mineral phase of fh does not change after about two months application as shown in fig 11b the xrd spectrum of the mag at the end of incubation experiment was basically consistent with that of pure magnetite chang et al 2021 this demonstrates that after about two months application there is no crystal phase transition of mag the influence of fh mag combined capping on p transportation and transformation in sediment ow system was studied by adopting columns as reactors and the obtained results are listed in figs 7 9 during the whole experimental process the sediment cores in the control and covering columns were kept in anoxic environments fig 7a the ow ph for the control and capping columns approached to neutral fig 7b the concentrations of drp in ow for the fh mag combined capping columns were considerably less when compared to those for the control column fig 7c the reduction rates of ow drp by the direct and fabric wrapped fh mag mixture capping were in the ranges of 76 7 98 2 and 66 7 94 4 respectively fig 7d this demonstrates that the direct and fabric wrapped fh mag mixture capping both can effectively restrict the release of endogenous p from sediment to ow under anoxic conditions generally the variation of lpdgt in ow can be applied to reflect the variation of ow drp concentration qu et al 2023 the concentrations of ow lpdgt under the direct fh mag mixture capping condition were significantly lower than those under no treatment condition fig 8a and c the reduction rates of ow lpdgt by the direct fh mag mixture capping on the 75th day ranged from 32 0 to 91 1 with the average lpdgt reduction efficiency of 66 3 fig 8b the removal rates of ow lpdgt by the direct fh mag mixture capping on the 143rd day were between 66 7 and 100 with the mean lpdgt elimination rate of 85 9 fig 8d this further confirms that the release of endogenous p from sediment into ow under anoxic conditions can be effectively suppressed by the fh mag mixture capping to illustrate the mechanism that governs the control of sediment p liberation into ow by the fh mag combined capping it is very necessary to study the effect of direct fh mag mixture capping on the vertical distributions of lpdgt and lfedgt in sediment after the capping of sediment with the fh mag mixture the concentrations of lpdgt in the upper sediment obviously decreased fig 8a and c on the 75th day the elimination efficiencies of lpdgt in the 0 26 mm sediment by the direct fh mag mixture capping were in the range of 64 7 89 9 fig 8b the removal efficiencies of lpdgt in the 0 46 mm sediment by the direct fh mag mixture capping on the 143rd day were between 75 3 and 98 6 fig 8d this suggests that the fh mag mixture capping can effectively immobilize the lpdgt in the upper sediment on the 75th day the fh mag mixture capping had a small or no effect on the lfedgt concentration in the sediment layer on the whole fig 9 on the 143rd day although the fh mag mixture capping gave rise to the decreased concentration of lfedgt in the sediment layer on the whole there was still a certain concentration level of lfedgt in the sediment profile fig 9 the presence of lfedgt in the sediment profile for the combined capping column fig 9 demonstrates that under the condition of fh mag mixture capping p still could be released from sediment into pw via the reductive dissolution of iron iii minerals however the drp in pw can be eliminated by the fh mag mixture capping system because of the phosphate adsorption onto fh and mag which resulted in the decrease of the pw drp concentration after the concentration of pw drp decreased the lpdgt in sediment was migrated into the pw to compensate the decrease of the drp concentration the rate of phosphate adsorption onto fh and mag was larger than that of p release from lpdgt which gave rise to the low lpdgt concentration in the upper sediment this further induced the low molecular diffusion flux of p from the upper sediment to the overlying water which led to the low concentration of drp and lpdgt in the overlying water thus the inactivation of lpdgt in the upper sediment played a significant role in the interception of endogenous p liberation from sediment into ow under anoxic conditions by the fh mag mixture capping 3 5 effect of fh mag combined amendment and capping on microorganisms in sediment microorganisms play an irreplaceable role in the cycle processes of phosphorus in water bodies chen et al 2019a yin et al 2023 the bacterial community diversity of sediments from the control amendment and capping columns is shown in table 2 as presented in table 2 the sequencing depth of sediments in the control amendment and capping columns was enough due to the fact that the coverage was more than 97 this indicates that the sequencing results completely represent the structural characteristics of the bacterial community of the sediments in the control amendment and capping columns the fh mag combined amendment decreased the ace and chao values table 2 after the addition of the fh mag mixture into sediment the value of shannon index decreased but the value of simpson index increased table 2 the bacterial richness can be reflected by the chao and ace indexes li et al 2022a the larger chao and ace indexes mean the higher bacterial richness li et al 2022a the shannon index is a reflection of the species diversity and the larger the value of shannon index the greater the bacterial community diversity wang et al 2022b the simpson index also reflects the bacterial diversity li et al 2022a however the larger the simpson index is the lower the microbial diversity is li et al 2022a thus the microbial richness and diversity of sediment were reduced by the fh mag combined amendment it should be noted that after the fh mag mixture amendment the values of shannon ace and chao decreased by 1 0 12 1 and 12 2 respectively and the value of simpson increased by 4 8 table 2 this demonstrates that the fh mag combined amendment did not produce a large effect on the richness and diversity of bacterial community in the sediment the fh mag mixture capping had no impact on the shannon value but increased the simpson value table 2 in addition the ace and chao values rose after the fh mag mixture capping table 2 these results imply that sediment capping with the fh mag mixture can decrease the diversity of bacterial community in the sediment but can increase the richness of bacterial community in the sediment it should be noted that after sediment capping with the fh mag mixture the values of simpson ace and chao increased by only 4 3 3 9 and 3 1 respectively this suggests that the fh mag mixture capping did not produce a large effect on the diversity and richness of bacterial community in the sediment the venn diagram of outs of microbes in the sediments from the control amendment and capping columns is presented in fig 12 as shown in fig 12 3970 otus were common key species that were observed in the sediments under no treatment and fh mag combined amendment the unique otus made up of 19 5 and 15 9 of the total species in the control and fh mag combined amendment columns respectively this demonstrates that the fh mag combined amendment has a certain impact on the core bacteria in the sediment it can also be seen from fig 12 that the numbers of sediment otus in the control and covering columns were 4931 and 5056 respectively which indicates that the fh mag mixture capping can increase the total number of sediment otus furthermore the number of the common otus in the control and capping columns was 4229 accounting for 85 8 and 83 6 of the total sediment otus in the control and capping columns respectively this means that the fh mag mixture capping has a certain effect on the core bacteria in the sediment fig 13 a shows the relative abundance of bacterial taxa at phylum level in the sediments from the control amendment and capping columns as shown in fig 13a at the phylum level the main bacterial community of the sediments in the control amendment and capping columns were chloroflexi proteobacteria firmicutes actinobacteriota acidobacteriota and desulfobacterota etc previous researches have shown that chloroflexi can decompose organic matter and release inorganic phosphorus chang et al 2020 shao et al 2023 sulfate reducing microorganism srm possesses the ability of reducing sulfate to form hydrogen sulfide niu et al 2021 gao et al found that the main phyla of dsrb containing srm were proteobacteria firmicutes and acidobacteriota gao et al 2022a proteobacteria phylum is a very diverse group of bacteria and some of them belong to srm yin et al 2021 members of the phylum desulfobacterota are mostly srm watanabe et al 2022 the reduction of sulfate to hydrogen sulfide helps maintain anoxic conditions yin et al 2021 an extensively accepted view is that anoxic environments are beneficial to r p release from sediment gao et al 2016 hu et al 2022 kong et al 2021 in addition sulfide can chemically reduce the iron and manganese oxides hydroxides in sediments which results in the release of r p yao et al 2022 yin et al observed that some organic phosphorus solubilizing bacteria are classified as proteobacteria phylum yin et al 2022 liang et al observed that the microbial dissimilatory iron reduction which makes a vital contribution to the transportation and transformation of p in sediment often linked to the bacterial family geobacteraceae proteobacteria liang et al 2022a chen et al observed that actinobacteriota was the dominant phylum of phosphorus mineralizing bacteria chen et al 2019a therefore the presence of chloroflexi proteobacteria firmicutes actinobacteriota acidobacteriota and desulfobacterota in the sediments of control amendment and capping columns may decrease the redox potential of the sediments and convert some insoluble p into soluble p thus resulting in the endogenous p release from the sediment into the interstitial water under the conditions of no treatment fh mag combined amendment and fh mag combined capping fig 13b shows the relative abundance of bacterial taxa at genus level in the sediments from the control amendment and capping columns as shown in fig 13b the major bacterial genera in the sediments of the control amendment and capping columns included bacillus and desulfatiglans the bacteria belonged to bacillus has the ability to promote the reduction of iron iii oxides hydroxides to soluble iron ii species han et al 2022 meng et al 2021 the presence of bacillus in the sediments of the control amendment and capping columns indicates that the reductive dissolution of fe iii minerals driven by microorganisms should take place thus the microbial reductive dissolution of phosphorus loaded fe iii minerals is a mechanism responsible for endogenous phosphorus release from sediment into pw under the conditions of no treatment fh mag combined amendment and fh mag combined capping desulfatiglans were sulfate reducing bacteria yi et al 2021 the presence of desulfatiglans in the sediments of the control amendment and capping columns means that the reduction of sulfate to sulfide driven by sulfate reducing bacteria should take place therefore the sulfide mediated chemical iron iii reduction scir may be another mechanism that dominates the release of endogenous p from sediment to pw under the conditions of no treatment fh mag combined amendment and fh mag combined capping 3 6 implication for practical application and future research this work concluded that the fh mag mixture addition and capping had a good performance for the restriction of endogenous p release from sediment to ow in anoxic state furthermore the fh mag mixture addition and capping cannot increase the risk of iron release from sediment in addition the fh mag mixture addition and capping can only have a certain effect on the richness and diversity of bacterial community and the core bacteria in the sediment thus taking into account the controlling efficiency and environmental friendliness the utilization of fh mag mixture as an active covering or amendment material has a great potential in the restriction of endogenous p liberation from sediment into ow sediment capping is easy to be achieved by spraying the capping material on the sediment ow interface abel et al 2017 however sediment amendment generally needs a special mechanical device to mix the sediment with the amendment material abel et al 2017 therefore taking into account the application convenience the use of fh mag mixture as an active capping material to suppress the liberation of endogenous p from sediment to ow is better than that as an amendment material after capping sediment with the fh mag mixture the applied mag may be recycled from the water body under the action of an external magnetic field such as a magnet funes et al 2016 funes et al 2017b however the applied fh is generally hard to be recycled from the water body in addition if no measure is adopted to protect the powdery fh mag mixture the mixing of the fh mag mixture with the sediment should occur under the actions of strong bioturbation and hydrodynamic disturbance this makes the recycling of the applied mag become very difficult if the p loaded fh mag mixture still remains in place the fh mag mixture bound p may be released into pw and ow when future environmental condition changes funes et al 2016 funes et al 2017b what s more the permanent placement of the fh mag mixture in the water body will result in the waste of fe resource therefore it is very necessary to take appropriate measures to take the fh and mag back from the water body after the fh mag combined capping previous studies have shown that it is a feasible method to use the permeable fabric to protect the capping layer from being damaged gu et al 2017 lin et al 2020a qu et al 2023 the active capping system constructed by wrapping magnetic pism with permeable fabric possesses magnetism and it can be easy to be recycled from the water body with the help of an external magnetism field such as magnet lin et al 2020a lin and chen 2021 qu et al 2023 in addition the active capping system based on fabric also can be recycled by lifting huang et al 2023 thus the use of the permeable fabric to wrap the fh mag mixture to form the recyclable active capping system not only can prevent the destruction of the powdery fh mag mixture covering layer by strong hydrodynamic and biological disturbance but also can make the capping material easy to be recycled from the water body with the help of an external magnetic field or lifting furthermore it is easy to construct the recyclable active capping system by wrapping the fh mag mixture with the permeable fabric thus the fabric wrapped fh mag mixture capping is a promising strategy for intercepting the release of endogenous p from sediment into ow due to its advantages of high controlling efficiency environmental friendliness application convenience and sustainability in this study there are still some aspects that need to be improved and explored first the efficiency of fabric wrapped fh mag mixture capping to control p release from sediment in real environment needs to be further studied second natural magnetite is considered as a readily available and low cost iron mineral because of its abundance in nature hu et al 2020a jiang and zhu 2021 therefore the substitution of natural magnetite for artificial magnetite to construct the fabric wrapped fh mag capping systems may be feasible however this needs to be further studied moreover higher h m po4 m 3 adsorption capacity commonly is favorable for the use of pisms to control the internal release to ow spears et al 2013 thus in order to better apply fh and mag to control p release from sediment modifying fh and mag to increase their h m po4 m 3 adsorption capacity is still necessary 4 conclusions 1 the fh mag combined amendment effectively hindered the liberation of endogenous p from sediment into ow under anoxic condition and the immobilization of lpdgt and mob p in the sediment played a key role in the suppression of endogenous p release by the fh mag combined amendment 2 combined capping sediment with fh and mag effectively hindered the release of endogenous p from sediment to ow and the immobilization of lpdgt in the upper sediment played a key part in the control of sediment p liberation by the fh mag mixture capping the stability of p bound by the fh mag combined capping layer was related to its construction way and most around 90 of p bound to the fh mag mixture has a low releasing risk under common ph 5 9 and anoxic conditions 3 the fh mag mixture amendment and capping not only did not increase the risk of iron release from sediment and but also did not produce a large impact on the diversity and richness of bacterial community in the sediment 4 the combined use of fh and mag as a composite amendment or capping material to prevent sediment p release into ow can make full use of their respective advantages 5 the permeable fabric wrapped fh mag mixture capping is a very promising strategy for restricting the release of endogenous p from sediment into ow due to its advantages of high internal p release interception efficiency environmental friendliness

14912,manganese dioxide mno2 can mediate organic pollutant oxidation in aquatic environments which has been reported to be inhibited or promoted by dissolved organic matter dom in different studies it remains unresolved why conflicting results have been observed and whether such results depend on the type and concentration of dom here we used three types of well characterized dom derived from soil heated at 50 250 or 400 c dom 50 dom 250 and dom 400 respectively to evaluate the impacts of dom type and concentration and environmental ph on mno2 mediated oxidation of sulfamethoxazole a widely detected and ecotoxic emerging pollutant we observed that the degradation rate of sulfamethoxazole was possibly promoted by dom 250 ph 6 8 while it was generally inhibited by dom 50 and dom 400 furthermore it was initially inhibited and then promoted with increasing dom concentrations and was consistently less inhibited at a higher ph the inter dom variations of sulfamethoxazole degradation could be explained by the more enriched polyphenolics in dom 250 than in dom 50 and dom 400 whereas the weak promoting effect of dom 400 indicates that high dom aromaticity may not necessarily promote pollutant degradation our results reconcile the debate on the role of dom in the oxidation of sulfamethoxazole by mno2 and highlight the decisiveness of the molecular composition and concentration of dom and the reaction ph in the overall promoting or inhibiting role of dom graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords manganese dioxide soil derived dissolved organic matter sulfamethoxazole

antibiotics endocrine disruptors and pesticides li et al 2020a stone and morgan 2002 wang et al 2018 the processes of organic pollutant degradation by mno2 mainly include i forming a precursor complex

organic matter dom and inorganic ions li et al 2022 remucal and ginder vogel 2014 dom is ubiquitous in water which usually contains thousands of molecules with different reactive functional groups and aromaticity mcdonough et al 2022 numerous studies have reported that dom participates in the transformation of organic pollutants by mno2 ding et al 2022 li et al 2012 roth et al 2022 both inhibiting and promoting effects of dom have been reported without a clear conclusion guo et al 2021 huang and yang 2022 remucal and ginder vogel 2014 zhou et al 2022 specifically the inhibiting role was attributed to the competitive occupation of the reaction sites on the mno2 surface by dom ding et al 2022 trainer et al 2021 and scavenging reactive radicals of organic pollutants yang et al 2022 the promoting role was attributed to the dom induced complexation of released mn ii ions as mn ii could significantly block the active sites of mno2 lin et al 2013 sun et al 2013 zhou et al 2022 to simplify the heterogeneous nature of dom model constituents such as gallic acid humic acid syringaldehyde and catechol have commonly been used to evaluate the complex role of dom guo et al 2021 huang and yang 2022 song et al 2019 zhou et al 2022 however the conclusions derived from model compounds cannot sufficiently explain the behaviors of natural dom remucal and ginder vogel 2014 and the role of dom in the oxidation of organic pollutants by mno2 is yet to be elucidated dom properties and composition can be important factors in the opposite effects of dom on the degradation of organic pollutants based on experiments of aquatic dom aromatic compounds were reported as being more preferentially adsorbed and oxidized onto mno2 trainer et al 2021 wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 zhou et al 2022 compared to autochthonous dom allochthonous dom such as soil derived dom usually contains more aromatic molecules e g polyphenolics and condensed aromatics which may have stronger interactions with mno2 and lead to a complex role in organic pollutant transformation chen et al 2022 ding et al 2022 roth et al 2019 although both polyphenolics and condensed aromatics are classified as aromatic dom the effects of dom on the transformation of organic pollutants by mno2 may differ between polyphenolic rich and condensed aromatic rich dom which remains unclear heating processes at different temperatures alter the properties e g aromaticity and degree of aromatic condensation and composition of soil derived dom roth et al 2022 xu et al 2021 goranov et al 2020 thurman et al 2020 santos et al 2016 this approach allows preparation of dom with different characteristics and compositions to investigate the impact of the dom type on the transformation of organic pollutants by mno2 recently the pyrogenic dom is of increasing concern due to its high release from frequent wildfire occurrence and biochar applications jaffé et al 2013 pellegrini et al 2022 and its special impact on pollutant behavior chen et al 2022 xu et al 2021 goranov et al 2020 therefore studying its environmental role also allows us to better predict further changes in water quality in fire prone and biochar added watersheds in this study we used dom derived from soil that was dried or heated at 50 250 and 400 c to evaluate the impacts of the soil derived dom type and concentration on the transformation of organic pollutants by mno2 within a ph range of 4 0 to 8 0 sulfamethoxazole smx was selected as the target organic pollutant because it is one of the most applied antibiotics with high detection rates and high environmental concentrations malvar et al 2021 moreover nuclear magnetic resonance nmr spectroscopy and fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms analyses were performed to elucidate the molecular level dom properties and compositions and explore the possible reason for distinct effects related to the dom type this study improves the current understanding of the fate of contaminants that are closely coupled to the biogeochemical cycles of both soil derived dom and mno2 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all chemicals were commercially available and

250 and dom 400 respectively were prepared in the laboratory the temperature selection was based on the common range of reported fire temperatures for the soil surface to represent low 250 c and high 400 c fire intensity conditions so that the characteristics and composition of soil derived dom varied significantly between the selected temperatures wang et al 2015 soil drying at 50 c was achieved

1 dual role of soil derived dom in smx oxidation by mno2 3 1 1 effect of dom type to better understand the influence of dom on smx transformation by mno2 the transformations of smx 5 µm in initial by mno2 0 5 mm with and without three different dom types dom 50 dom 250 and dom 400 with varying doc concentrations 0 20 mg c l 1 at ph 6 0 0 2 were investigated fig 1 interestingly dom 250 had a significant promoting effect whereas dom 50 and dom 400 inhibited smx oxidation by mno2 the smx transformation efficiency for the control no dom addition dom 50 dom 250 and dom 400 treatments in 4 h were 8 8 2 6 3 4 1 5 13 1 1 8 and 3 8 0 9 respectively fig 1a the adsorption and oxidation of smx by soil derived dom could be ignored because little smx was removed in the presence of dom or oxidized dom pretreated by mno2 without the addition of mno2 fig s5 moreover insignificant change in the doc concentration of soil derived dom after reacting with mno2 fig s6 suggests that only a very small amount of dom was adsorbed on mno2 as previously reported relatively poor fitting of the first order model for the oxidation of organic pollutants by mno2 was found which was likely due to the loss of active surface sites on mno2 during the gradual accumulation of reaction products on the surface song et al 2019 zhang et al 2008 zhang and huang 2005 to better evaluate the corresponding reaction kinetics the initial reaction rate constant for the early reaction stage with good regression coefficients r 2 0 9 was applied text s7 juan et al 2012 the resulting pseudo first order reaction rate constant k obs s 1 values showed highly significant linear correlations r 2 0 9 with p 0 05 with the smx degradation efficiency table s1 and fig s7 which confirms that the k obs value could sufficiently describe the smx degradation efficiency correspondingly the k obs values of smx oxidations were 1 56 0 72 10 5 s 1 without dom 0 42 0 24 10 5 s 1 dom 50 2 89 0 58 10 5 s 1 dom 250 and 0 89 0 10 10 5 s 1 dom 400 fig 1a our results confirmed the opposite effects of different dom types on the transformation of smx by mno2 possibly owing to their distinct physicochemical properties and molecular compositions 3 1 2 effect of the dom concentration the overall effect of dom on smx oxidation by mno2 was concentration dependent fig 1b taking the case with a ph of 6 0 as an example the addition of 5 mg c l 1 dom 50 and dom 400 dramatically decreased the k obs from 1 56 0 72 10 5 s 1 in the control to 0 25 0 02 10 5 s 1 for dom 50 and 0 45 0 05 10 5 s 1 for dom 400 fig 1b however the addition of 5 mg c l 1 of dom 250 did not significantly change the k obs fig 1b regardless of the dom type when the dom concentration increased from 5 to 20 mg c l 1 the k obs consistently increased fig 1b such increases caused the overall promoting effects of dom 250 at 10 and 20 mg c l 1 although the overall effects of dom 50 and dom 400 at concentrations of 5 20 mg c l 1 remained inhibiting compared to the control fig 1b here we propose two important concentration related indices for each soil derived dom at a specific ph i critical competed concentration dom c at which the greatest inhibiting effect is achieved and ii critical balanced concentration dom b at which the inhibiting and promoting effects of dom were balanced taking ph 6 0 as an example dom 50 c and dom 400 c were approximately 5 mg c l 1 whereas dom 50 b and dom 400 b were 20 mg c l 1 in contrast dom 250 c was 5 mg c l 1 and dom 250 b was approximately 5 mg c l 1 under the studied conditions fig 1b these results further suggest that the properties and molecular composition of dom could further affect the dom concentration dependence of the oxidation rate of smx by mno2 3 1 3 effect of reaction ph the k obs values consistently decreased with increasing ph fig 2 and fig s8 the transformation of organic pollutants by mno2 commonly occurred in acidic conditions because the surface charge of mno2 pollutant species distribution redox potential of mno2 and detachment of mn ii iii could facilitate the reaction under low ph conditions huang and yang 2022 ding et al 2021 gao et al 2014 first as shown in fig s9 smx exhibits two pka values consistent with the previous study the first protonation of aniline 1 5 pka 1 leads to a change from the cationic species of smx with increasing ph and the second deprotonation of the sulfonamide nh 5 7 pka 2 leads to smx change to the anionic species at higher ph values as reported the anionic smx species i e at ph 6 0 7 0 and 8 0 are more reactive than the neutral species i e at ph 4 0 and 5 0 dodd and huang 2004 therefore the smx species shifted from neutral to anionic when the ph increased from 4 0 to 8 0 fig s9 leading to the increased reactivity of smx moreover with the ph increasing the surface charge of mno2 decreased fig s3 leading to the electrostatic repulsion decrease and further increasing the formation of smx mno2 precursor huang and yang 2022 zhou et al 2022 however the detachment of mn ii iii is hindered due to the stronger electrostatic repulsion at a higher ph leading to the block of the accessible reaction sites on the mno2 surface li et al 2020a li et al 2020b secondly due to the redox potential of mno2 decreasing with increasing ph the electron transfer efficiency between reactants decreased huang and yang 2022 therefore increasing ph simultaneously promoted and inhibited the reaction through multiple mechanisms and showed a net inhibiting effect on smx degradation as reported in previous studies song et al 2019 the promoting effect of dom 250 was more pronounced at a higher reaction ph the k obs for dom 250 at ph 6 0 7 0 and 8 0 were 1 9 2 9 and 4 8 times higher than that of the control respectively fig 2 this supports the observation that the promoting mechanisms prefer higher ph conditions guo et al 2021 huang and yang 2022 the promoting role of dom 250 was not observed at ph values of 4 0 or 5 0 suggesting that the overall promoting or inhibiting role of soil derived dom in smx oxidation by mno2 was regulated by the reaction ph for dom 50 and dom 400 the inhibiting effect decreased with increasing ph inferring that the potential promoting component also existed however the effect size may have been small and thus could not offset the inhibiting effect huang and yang 2022 overall the abovementioned results indicate that both inhibiting and promoting effects of dom on the transformation of smx by mno2 could be achieved depending on i the dom type ii the initial dom concentration and iii the reaction ph therefore resolving the various amounts of reaction inhibiting and reaction promoting components in dom is critical to understanding the way in which the above mentioned factors interact and control the overall inhibiting or promoting effect of dom 3 2 bulk and molecular level characteristics of soil derived dom the dom level indicated by water extractable organic carbon weoc was highest in soil heated at 250 c table 1 and fig s10 which can be attributed to the increased hydrophilic functional groups when the soils were heated at 250 c solid state 13c nmr spectroscopy fig s11 and ft icr ms analyses showed that when the heating temperature increased from 50 c to 250 c and then to 400 c there was an increase in aromaticity and decrease in molecular weight mw table 1 the two commonly used optical indices of dom i e specific ultraviolet visible absorbance suva254 l mg c 1 m 1 and the ratio of absorbances at 254 nm and 365 nm e2 e3 fig s10 and fig s12 confirmed that dom 400 had the highest aromaticity and lowest average mw among the three soil derived dom types these results are consistent with previously reported findings on the effects of heating temperature on the properties of soil derived dom goranov et al 2020 santos et al 2016 thurman et al 2020 it was reasonable because of significant consumption of non aromatic carbohydrates starting from 250 c indicated by o alkyl and di o alkyl c in the nmr spectra as well as further consumption of non aromatic aliphatics indicated by alkyl c in the nmr spectra and formation of aromatic compounds e g condensed aromatic compounds at 400 c indicated by aromatic and o aromatic c in the nmr spectra and aimod based on the ft icr ms analyses table 1 based on experiments on the effect of aquatic source dom on the transformation of organic pollutants by mno2 previous studies have proposed that compounds with high aromaticity and high mw are preferentially adsorbed and oxidized wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 however the promoting effect was neither greater in the more aromatic dom 400 than in the less aromatic dom 250 nor was it greater in the higher mw dom 50 than in the lower mw dom 400 therefore the bulk properties of dom aromaticity and mw may not necessarily fully explain the role of dom in pollutant degradation instead we propose further examination of the molecular composition of dom the van krevelen diagram based on the ft icr ms analysis showed distinct molecular compositions among dom 50 dom 250 and dom 400 fig 3 which was further supported by three dimensional excitation emission matrices of soil derived doms fig s11 although dom 250 and dom 400 both contained more aromatic dom than dom 50 they had different degrees of aromatic condensation specifically dom 250 and dom 400 had high contents of unique polyphenolics and condensed aromatics respectively fig 3 and table 1 the proportion of polyphenolics 0 5 aimod 0 67 was 27 24 in dom 250 which was higher than that in dom 50 18 97 and dom 400 22 23 the relative abundance of condensed aromatics aimod 0 67 and c 15 was 73 36 in dom 400 which was much higher than that in dom 50 4 98 and dom 250 6 42 we noted that dom 400 dominated by condensed aromatics had an overall inhibiting effect on smx degradation by mno2 this clearly demonstrated that not all aromatic dom types promote the degradation of smx by mno2 3 3 potential mechanisms of the dual role of dom this study demonstrated different reaction promoting and inhibiting capacities among dom types fig 4 as the model phenolic constituents of dom such as catechol and syringaldehyde promoted smx degradation induced by mno2 guo et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 song et al 2019 the most significant promoting effect of dom 250 can be attributed to its highest content of polyphenolic among dom types fig s13 the promoting effect of polyphenolics involves two potential mechanisms i complexation of dissolved mn ii ions by polyphenolics suppresses the occupation of reaction sites on the mno2 surface song et al 2019 and ii the reactive semiquinone radical e h 0 0 4 v produced by oxidation of polyphenolics by mno2 further reacts with smx bialk et al 2007 gulkowska et al 2013 zhou et al 2021 interestingly dom 400 had the highest aromaticity but did not exhibit a promoting effect on the degradation of smx by mno2 considering that the mno2 generally selectively adsorbs the compounds with high aromaticity and mw of dom ding et al 2022 trainer et al 2021 the condensed aromatic rich dom could occupy a significant proportion of reactive sites of mno2 nevertheless the oxidation intermediates and products of condensed aromatics dominated in dom 400 may not efficiently react with smx guo et al 2021 huang and yang 2022 song et al 2019 when a promoting effect occurred in a specific polyphenolic rich dom type and at a relatively neutral to high ph the inhibiting effect of dom appeared more common in environmentally relevant conditions fig 4 the components of dom can be adsorbed on mno2 by various mechanisms e g radical coupling electrostatic interaction and cation bridging leading to the occupation of reactive sites on the mno2 surface ding et al 2022 trainer et al 2021 and quenching of the reactive intermediate species reversing the reaction back to smx yang et al 2022 thus having an overall inhibiting effect the initial dom concentration also influenced smx degradation after conducting the cross experiment the initial concentration effect of soil derived dom showed non monotonic patterns fig 4 and fig s14 table s1 which can be well described by two critical concentrations i e dom c and dom b interestingly dom c and dom b differed between the various soil derived dom types with an increase in the proportion of polyphenolics in dom dom c and dom b both decreased at a given ph this is reasonable because an increasing bulk dom concentration indicates increasing amounts of both reaction inhibiting and reaction promoting components with an increasing dom concentration the adsorption of dom on mno2 could be first increased and then saturated whereas the inhibiting effect of dom first increased and then reached a plateau at a relatively low concentration a conceptual graph is shown in fig s15 however the reaction promoting components continuously increased with an increasing bulk dom concentration thus the promoting effect of dom would not reach a plateau at environmentally relevant dom concentrations i e 20 mg c l 1 at dom c the inhibiting role of soil derived dom surpassed the promoting role displaying the maximum net inhibiting effect in the reaction after dom c with a further increase in the dom concentration the inhibitory mechanism reached a plateau and the promoting mechanism was progressively elevated by increasing amounts of polyphenolic compounds because the polyphenol promoting role was more pronounced at a higher ph dom c and dom b decreased with increasing ph for a given type of dom in the oxidation of smx by mno2 the reaction ph was an important factor in both systems with and without soil derived dom fig 2 and fig 4 the oxidation of smx by mno2 consistently preferred acidic conditions mainly because mno2 is a potent oxidant at a lower ph balgooyen et al 2017 the inverse linear relationship between lnk obs and ph for smx fig 4 provided clear evidence that the decrease in the oxidation rate was a result of the decrease in the oxidation potency of mno2 at a higher ph zhang et al 2008 moreover the addition of soil derived dom significantly reduced the regression slope of lnk obs versus ph i e the sensitivity of k obs to ph this sensitivity decreased in the following order control dom 50 dom 400 dom 250 fig 4 which is negatively aligned with the order of the polyphenolic content in the soil derived dom types our findings based on the addition of soil derived dom were consistent with the previous findings based on the addition of phenolic model compounds e g syringaldehyde and gallic acid which reported greater promoting effects on smx oxidation by mno2 with higher ph and more phenolic content huang and yang 2022 song et al 2019 in the presence of 20 mg c l 1 dom 250 the k obs values were 25 69 253 420 and 591 that of the control without dom at ph 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 and 8 0 respectively table s1 and fig s16 this result further demonstrated that increasing the ph could elevate the promoting effect of soil derived dom most likely because polyphenol oxidation by mno2 and reactive intermediate production were enhanced with an increase in ph guo et al 2021 huang and yang 2022 similar trends were observed in the presence of 5 and 10 mg c l 1 dom 250 for dom 50 and dom 400 the overall role was consistently inhibiting under all conditions and the inhibiting effects decreased with an increasing ph this was likely because the promoting role of polyphenolics was insufficient to overcome the inhibiting role of other components of soil derived dom huang and yang 2022 particularly when the ph was low so that reactive site blocking would be severe and reactive intermediate production would be low overall promoting inhibiting and negligible effects of dom were observed in smx degradation by mno2 under different reaction conditions e g dom compositions dom concentrations and reaction ph particularly the molecular composition of soil derived dom strongly influenced the role of dom in the degradation of smx by mno2 as well as the concentration and ph dependence of the smx degradation rate similar non monotonic concentration dependence of dom was also observed in sulfonamide antibiotics induced by sulfate radicals canonica and schönenberger 2019 inferring that two critical indices dom c and dom b have the potential to describe the dual role of dom in organic pollutant transformation for various reaction systems 3 4 environmental implications using different dom types to evaluate the dual role of dom in smx oxidation by mno2 provided important information to assess the reactivity of aromatic compounds previous studies suggest that aromatic dom may promote mno2 mediated smx oxidation wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 however we showed that the promoting effect of soil derived dom on smx oxidation was primarily ascribed to its polyphenolic content rather than its condensed aromatic content according to bulk and molecular level analyses of soil derived dom this finding implies that elucidation of the composition and characteristics of various dom types is critical for an improved understanding of their uncertain role in pollutant degradation globally frequent fire events and widespread usage of pyrogenic biomass e g biochar have greatly increased the amounts of heated soil derived dom in aquatic environments via rainwater runoff pellegrini et al 2022 stubbins et al 2015 dittmar and paeng 2009 lehmann 2007 druffel 2004 approximately 18 203 tg yr 1 of condensed aromatic components are estimated to enter the environment bostick et al 2018 these components comprise nearly 10 of the bulk doc in fluvial systems jaffé et al 2013 therefore the impact of condensed aromatic dom e g dissolved black carbon on pollutant fate and environmental quality has become an increasing environmental concern the inhibiting effect of condensed aromatic rich dom i e dom 400 implies that in biochar amended farmlands or wildfire prone regions the smx or smx like pollutants are expected to have greater persistence in soils and downstream waters however in our experiments dom from soil heated at 250 and 400 c had opposite effects on smx degradation possible promoting effect at ph 6 8 vs inhibiting effect at all ph levels respectively thus prescribed fires and low severity wildfires that are dominated by low temperature burning may have completely different environmental consequences than high severity wildfires therefore we urge that further studies on the environmental impacts of pyrogenic dom should carefully consider the extremely high chemo diversity of dom driven by different burning temperatures 4 conclusions in this study the role of dom in smx oxidation by mno2 under different ph environments was evaluated by studying dom types with distinct molecular compositions and concentrations the results demonstrated that smx oxidation could be either inhibited or promoted by dom depending on its composition and concentration and the environmental ph which reconciles the conflicting findings in previous studies our major conclusions are the following the overall role of soil derived dom in smx oxidation by mno2 was synergistically controlled by dom molecular composition concentration and environmental ph for a given dom type the role could switch from inhibition to promotion by increasing the dom concentration or environmental ph the promoting role of soil derived dom in smx oxidation by mno2 was primarily ascribed to the polyphenolics rather than condensed aromatics in dom according to bulk and molecular level analyses of dom molecular level characterization of dom can advance our understanding of dom impacts on pollutant transformation two concepts of critical dom concentration at a given ph can serve as indices to describe the dual role of dom and compare the impacts of dom type with additional data from future studies on the impacts of dom composition concentration and reaction conditions on pollutant degradation future modeling focused research may enable the prediction of pollutant fate in field

14912,manganese dioxide mno2 can mediate organic pollutant oxidation in aquatic environments which has been reported to be inhibited or promoted by dissolved organic matter dom in different studies it remains unresolved why conflicting results have been observed and whether such results depend on the type and concentration of dom here we used three types of well characterized dom derived from soil heated at 50 250 or 400 c dom 50 dom 250 and dom 400 respectively to evaluate the impacts of dom type and concentration and environmental ph on mno2 mediated oxidation of sulfamethoxazole a widely detected and ecotoxic emerging pollutant we observed that the degradation rate of sulfamethoxazole was possibly promoted by dom 250 ph 6 8 while it was generally inhibited by dom 50 and dom 400 furthermore it was initially inhibited and then promoted with increasing dom concentrations and was consistently less inhibited at a higher ph the inter dom variations of sulfamethoxazole degradation could be explained by the more enriched polyphenolics in dom 250 than in dom 50 and dom 400 whereas the weak promoting effect of dom 400 indicates that high dom aromaticity may not necessarily promote pollutant degradation our results reconcile the debate on the role of dom in the oxidation of sulfamethoxazole by mno2 and highlight the decisiveness of the molecular composition and concentration of dom and the reaction ph in the overall promoting or inhibiting role of dom graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords manganese dioxide soil derived dissolved organic matter sulfamethoxazole

and promoting effects of dom have been reported without a clear conclusion guo et al 2021 huang and yang 2022 remucal and ginder vogel 2014 zhou et al 2022 specifically the inhibiting role was attributed to the competitive occupation of the reaction sites on the mno2 surface by dom ding et al 2022 trainer et al 2021 and scavenging reactive radicals of organic pollutants yang et al 2022 the promoting role was attributed to the dom induced complexation of released mn ii ions as mn ii could significantly block the active sites of mno2 lin et al 2013 sun et al 2013 zhou et al 2022 to simplify the heterogeneous nature of dom model constituents such as gallic acid humic acid syringaldehyde and catechol have commonly been used to evaluate the complex role of dom guo et al 2021 huang and yang 2022 song et al 2019 zhou et al 2022 however the conclusions derived from model compounds cannot sufficiently explain the behaviors of natural dom remucal and ginder vogel 2014 and the role of dom in the oxidation of organic pollutants by mno2 is yet to be elucidated dom properties and composition can be important factors in the opposite effects of dom on the degradation of organic pollutants based on experiments of aquatic dom aromatic compounds were reported as being more preferentially adsorbed and oxidized onto mno2 trainer et al 2021 wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 zhou et

with mno2 and lead to a complex role in organic pollutant transformation chen et al 2022 ding et al 2022 roth et al 2019 although both polyphenolics and condensed aromatics are classified as aromatic dom the effects of dom on the transformation of organic pollutants by mno2 may differ between polyphenolic rich and condensed aromatic rich dom which remains unclear heating processes at different temperatures alter the properties e g aromaticity and degree of aromatic condensation and composition of soil derived dom roth et al 2022 xu et al 2021 goranov et al 2020 thurman et al 2020 santos et al 2016 this approach allows preparation of dom with different characteristics and compositions to investigate the impact of the dom type on the transformation of organic pollutants by mno2 recently the pyrogenic dom is of increasing concern due to its high release from frequent wildfire occurrence and biochar applications jaffé et al 2013 pellegrini et al 2022 and its special impact on pollutant behavior chen et al 2022 xu et al 2021 goranov et al 2020 therefore studying its environmental role also allows us to better predict further changes in water quality in fire prone and biochar added watersheds in this study we used dom derived from soil that was dried or heated at 50 250 and 400 c to evaluate the impacts of the soil derived dom type and concentration on the transformation of organic pollutants by mno2 within a ph range of 4 0 to 8 0 sulfamethoxazole smx was selected as the target organic pollutant because it is one of the most applied antibiotics with high detection rates and high environmental concentrations malvar et al 2021 moreover nuclear magnetic resonance nmr spectroscopy and fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms analyses were performed to elucidate the molecular level dom properties and compositions and explore the possible reason for distinct effects related to the dom type this study improves the current understanding of the fate of contaminants that are closely coupled to the biogeochemical cycles of both soil derived dom and mno2 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all chemicals were commercially available and

400 c fire intensity conditions so that the characteristics and composition of soil derived dom varied significantly between the selected temperatures wang et al 2015 soil drying at 50 c was achieved

1 dual role of soil derived dom in smx oxidation by mno2 3 1 1 effect of dom type to better understand the influence of dom on smx transformation by mno2 the transformations of smx 5 µm in initial by mno2 0 5 mm with and without three different dom types dom 50 dom 250 and dom 400 with varying doc concentrations 0 20 mg c l 1 at ph 6 0 0 2 were investigated fig 1 interestingly dom 250 had a significant promoting effect whereas dom 50 and dom 400 inhibited smx oxidation by mno2 the smx transformation efficiency for the control no dom addition dom 50 dom 250 and dom 400 treatments in 4 h were 8 8 2 6 3 4 1 5 13 1 1 8 and 3 8 0 9 respectively fig 1a the adsorption and oxidation of smx by soil derived dom could be ignored because little smx was removed in the presence of dom or oxidized dom pretreated by mno2 without the addition of mno2 fig s5 moreover insignificant change in the doc concentration of soil derived dom after reacting with mno2 fig s6 suggests that only a very small amount of dom was adsorbed on mno2 as previously reported relatively poor fitting of the first order model for the oxidation of organic pollutants by mno2 was found which was likely due to the loss of active surface sites on mno2 during the gradual accumulation of reaction products on the surface song et al 2019 zhang et al 2008 zhang and huang 2005 to better evaluate the corresponding reaction kinetics the initial reaction rate constant for the early reaction stage with good regression coefficients r 2 0 9 was applied text s7 juan et al 2012 the resulting pseudo first order reaction rate constant k obs s 1 values showed highly significant linear correlations r 2 0 9 with p 0 05 with the smx degradation efficiency table s1 and fig s7 which confirms that the k obs value could sufficiently describe the smx degradation efficiency correspondingly the k obs values of smx oxidations were 1 56 0 72 10 5 s 1 without dom 0 42 0 24 10 5 s 1 dom 50 2 89 0 58 10 5 s 1 dom 250 and 0 89 0 10 10 5 s 1 dom 400 fig 1a our results confirmed the opposite effects of different dom types on the transformation of smx by mno2 possibly owing to their distinct physicochemical properties and molecular compositions 3 1 2 effect of the dom concentration the overall effect of dom on smx oxidation by mno2 was concentration dependent fig 1b taking the case with a ph of 6 0 as an example the addition of 5 mg c l 1 dom 50 and dom 400 dramatically decreased the k obs from 1 56 0 72 10 5 s 1 in the control to 0 25 0 02 10 5 s 1 for dom 50 and 0 45 0 05 10 5 s 1 for dom 400 fig 1b however the addition of 5 mg c l 1 of dom 250 did not significantly change the k obs fig 1b regardless of the dom type when the dom concentration increased from 5 to 20 mg c l 1 the k obs consistently increased fig 1b such increases caused the overall promoting effects of dom 250 at 10 and 20 mg c l 1 although the overall effects of dom 50 and dom 400 at concentrations of 5 20 mg c l 1 remained inhibiting compared to the control fig 1b here we propose two important concentration related indices for each soil derived dom at a specific ph i critical competed concentration dom c at which the greatest inhibiting effect is achieved and ii critical balanced concentration dom b at which the inhibiting and promoting effects of dom were balanced taking ph 6 0 as an example dom 50 c and dom 400 c were approximately 5 mg c l 1 whereas dom 50 b and dom 400 b were 20 mg c l 1 in contrast dom 250 c was 5 mg c l 1 and dom 250 b was approximately 5 mg c l 1 under the studied conditions fig 1b these results further suggest that the properties and molecular composition of dom could further affect the dom concentration dependence of the oxidation rate of smx by mno2 3 1 3 effect of reaction ph the k obs values consistently decreased with increasing ph fig 2 and fig s8 the transformation of organic pollutants by mno2 commonly occurred in acidic conditions because the surface charge of mno2 pollutant species distribution redox potential of mno2 and detachment of mn ii iii could facilitate the reaction under low ph conditions huang and yang 2022 ding et al 2021 gao et al 2014 first as shown in fig s9 smx exhibits two pka values consistent with the previous study the first protonation of aniline 1 5 pka 1 leads to a change from the cationic species of smx with increasing ph and the second deprotonation of the sulfonamide nh 5 7 pka 2 leads to smx change to the anionic species at higher ph values as reported the anionic smx species i e at ph 6 0 7 0 and 8 0 are more reactive than the neutral species i e at ph 4 0 and 5 0 dodd and huang 2004 therefore the smx species shifted from neutral to anionic when the ph increased from 4 0 to 8 0 fig s9 leading to the increased reactivity of smx moreover with the ph increasing the surface charge of mno2 decreased fig s3 leading to the electrostatic repulsion decrease and further increasing the formation of smx mno2 precursor huang and yang 2022 zhou et al 2022 however the detachment of mn ii iii is hindered due to the stronger electrostatic repulsion at a higher ph leading to the block of the accessible reaction sites on the mno2 surface li et al 2020a li et al 2020b secondly due to the redox potential of mno2 decreasing with increasing ph the electron transfer efficiency between reactants decreased huang and yang 2022 therefore increasing ph simultaneously promoted and inhibited the reaction through multiple mechanisms and showed a net inhibiting effect on smx degradation as reported in previous studies song et al 2019 the promoting effect of dom 250 was more pronounced at a higher reaction ph the k obs for dom 250 at ph 6 0 7 0 and 8 0 were 1 9 2 9 and 4 8 times higher than that of the control respectively fig 2 this supports the observation that the promoting mechanisms prefer higher ph conditions guo et al 2021 huang and yang 2022 the promoting role of dom 250 was not observed at ph values of 4 0 or 5 0 suggesting that the overall promoting or inhibiting role of soil derived dom in smx oxidation by mno2 was regulated by the reaction ph for dom 50 and dom 400 the inhibiting effect decreased with increasing ph inferring that the potential promoting component also existed however the effect size may have been small and thus could not offset the inhibiting effect huang and yang 2022 overall the abovementioned results indicate that both inhibiting and promoting effects of dom on the transformation of smx by mno2 could be achieved depending on i the dom type ii the initial dom concentration and iii the reaction ph therefore resolving the various amounts of reaction inhibiting and reaction promoting components in dom is critical to understanding the way in which the above mentioned factors interact and control the overall inhibiting or promoting effect of dom 3 2 bulk and molecular level characteristics of soil derived dom the dom level indicated by water extractable organic carbon weoc was highest in soil heated at 250 c table 1 and fig s10 which can be attributed to the increased hydrophilic functional groups when the soils were heated at 250 c solid state 13c nmr spectroscopy fig s11 and ft icr ms analyses showed that when the heating temperature increased from 50 c to 250 c and then to 400 c there was an increase in aromaticity and decrease in molecular weight mw table 1 the two commonly used optical indices of dom i e specific ultraviolet visible absorbance suva254 l mg c 1 m 1 and the ratio of absorbances at 254 nm and 365 nm e2 e3 fig s10 and fig s12 confirmed that dom 400 had the highest aromaticity and lowest average mw among the three soil derived dom types these results are consistent with previously reported findings on the effects of heating temperature on the properties of soil derived dom goranov et al 2020 santos et al 2016 thurman et al 2020 it was reasonable because of significant consumption of non aromatic carbohydrates starting from 250 c indicated by o alkyl and di o alkyl c in the nmr spectra as well as further consumption of non aromatic aliphatics indicated by alkyl c in the nmr spectra and formation of aromatic compounds e g condensed aromatic compounds at 400 c indicated by aromatic and o aromatic c in the nmr spectra and aimod based on the ft icr ms analyses table 1 based on experiments on the effect of aquatic source dom on the transformation of organic pollutants by mno2 previous studies have proposed that compounds with high aromaticity and high mw are preferentially adsorbed and oxidized wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 however the promoting effect was neither greater in the more aromatic dom 400 than in the less aromatic dom 250 nor was it greater in the higher mw dom 50 than in the lower mw dom 400 therefore the bulk properties of dom aromaticity and mw may not necessarily fully explain the role of dom in pollutant degradation instead we propose further examination of the molecular composition of dom the van krevelen diagram based on the ft icr ms analysis showed distinct molecular compositions among dom 50 dom 250 and dom 400 fig 3 which was further supported by three dimensional excitation emission matrices of soil derived doms fig s11 although dom 250 and dom 400 both contained more aromatic dom than dom 50 they had different degrees of aromatic condensation specifically dom 250 and dom 400 had high contents of unique polyphenolics and condensed aromatics respectively fig 3 and table 1 the proportion of polyphenolics 0 5 aimod 0 67 was 27 24 in dom 250 which was higher than that in dom 50 18 97 and dom 400 22 23 the relative abundance of condensed aromatics aimod 0 67 and c 15 was 73 36 in dom 400 which was much higher than that in dom 50 4 98 and dom 250 6 42 we noted that dom 400 dominated by condensed aromatics had an overall inhibiting effect on smx degradation by mno2 this clearly demonstrated that not all aromatic dom types promote the degradation of smx by mno2 3 3 potential mechanisms of the dual role of dom this study demonstrated different reaction promoting and inhibiting capacities among dom types fig 4 as the model phenolic constituents of dom such as catechol and syringaldehyde promoted smx degradation induced by mno2 guo et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 song et al 2019 the most significant promoting effect of dom 250 can be attributed to its highest content of polyphenolic among dom types fig s13 the promoting effect of polyphenolics involves two potential mechanisms i complexation of dissolved mn ii ions by polyphenolics suppresses the occupation of reaction sites on the mno2 surface song et al 2019 and ii the reactive semiquinone radical e h 0 0 4 v produced by oxidation of polyphenolics by mno2 further reacts with smx bialk et al 2007 gulkowska et al 2013 zhou et al 2021 interestingly dom 400 had the highest aromaticity but did not exhibit a promoting effect on the degradation of smx by mno2 considering that the mno2 generally selectively adsorbs the compounds with high aromaticity and mw of dom ding et al 2022 trainer et al 2021 the condensed aromatic rich dom could occupy a significant proportion of reactive sites of mno2 nevertheless the oxidation intermediates and products of condensed aromatics dominated in dom 400 may not efficiently react with smx guo et al 2021 huang and yang 2022 song et al 2019 when a promoting effect occurred in a specific polyphenolic rich dom type and at a relatively neutral to high ph the inhibiting effect of dom appeared more common in environmentally relevant conditions fig 4 the components of dom can be adsorbed on mno2 by various mechanisms e g radical coupling electrostatic interaction and cation bridging leading to the occupation of reactive sites on the mno2 surface ding et al 2022 trainer et al 2021 and quenching of the reactive intermediate species reversing the reaction back to smx yang et al 2022 thus having an overall inhibiting effect the initial dom concentration also influenced smx degradation after conducting the cross experiment the initial concentration effect of soil derived dom showed non monotonic patterns fig 4 and fig s14 table s1 which can be well described by two critical concentrations i e dom c and dom b interestingly dom c and dom b differed between the various soil derived dom types with an increase in the proportion of polyphenolics in dom dom c and dom b both decreased at a given ph this is reasonable because an increasing bulk dom concentration indicates increasing amounts of both reaction inhibiting and reaction promoting components with an increasing dom concentration the adsorption of dom on mno2 could be first increased and then saturated whereas the inhibiting effect of dom first increased and then reached a plateau at a relatively low concentration a conceptual graph is shown in fig s15 however the reaction promoting components continuously increased with an increasing bulk dom concentration thus the promoting effect of dom would not reach a plateau at environmentally relevant dom concentrations i e 20 mg c l 1 at dom c the inhibiting role of soil derived dom surpassed the promoting role displaying the maximum net inhibiting effect in the reaction after dom c with a further increase in the dom concentration the inhibitory mechanism reached a plateau and the promoting mechanism was progressively elevated by increasing amounts of polyphenolic compounds because the polyphenol promoting role was more pronounced at a higher ph dom c and dom b decreased with increasing ph for a given type of dom in the oxidation of smx by mno2 the reaction ph was an important factor in both systems with and without soil derived dom fig 2 and fig 4 the oxidation of smx by mno2 consistently preferred acidic conditions mainly because mno2 is a potent oxidant at a lower ph balgooyen et al 2017 the inverse linear relationship between lnk obs and ph for smx fig 4 provided clear evidence that the decrease in the oxidation rate was a result of the decrease in the oxidation potency of mno2 at a higher ph zhang et al 2008 moreover the addition of soil derived dom significantly reduced the regression slope of lnk obs versus ph i e the sensitivity of k obs to ph this sensitivity decreased in the following order control dom 50 dom 400 dom 250 fig 4 which is negatively aligned with the order of the polyphenolic content in the soil derived dom types our findings based on the addition of soil derived dom were consistent with the previous findings based on the addition of phenolic model compounds e g syringaldehyde and gallic acid which reported greater promoting effects on smx oxidation by mno2 with higher ph and more phenolic content huang and yang 2022 song et al 2019 in the presence of 20 mg c l 1 dom 250 the k obs values were 25 69 253 420 and 591 that of the control without dom at ph 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 and 8 0 respectively table s1 and fig s16 this result further demonstrated that increasing the ph could elevate the promoting effect of soil derived dom most likely because polyphenol oxidation by mno2 and reactive intermediate production were enhanced with an increase in ph guo et al 2021 huang and yang 2022 similar trends were observed in the presence of 5 and 10 mg c l 1 dom 250 for dom 50 and dom 400 the overall role was consistently inhibiting under all conditions and the inhibiting effects decreased with an increasing ph this was likely because the promoting role of polyphenolics was insufficient to overcome the inhibiting role of other components of soil derived dom huang and yang 2022 particularly when the ph was low so that reactive site blocking would be severe and reactive intermediate production would be low overall promoting inhibiting and negligible effects of dom were observed in smx degradation by mno2 under different reaction conditions e g dom compositions dom concentrations and reaction ph particularly the molecular composition of soil derived dom strongly influenced the role of dom in the degradation of smx by mno2 as well as the concentration and ph dependence of the smx degradation rate similar non monotonic concentration dependence of dom was also observed in sulfonamide antibiotics induced by sulfate radicals canonica and schönenberger 2019 inferring that two critical indices dom c and dom b have the potential to describe the dual role of dom in organic pollutant transformation for various reaction systems 3 4 environmental implications using different dom types to evaluate the dual role of dom in smx oxidation by mno2 provided important information to assess the reactivity of aromatic compounds previous studies suggest that aromatic dom may promote mno2 mediated smx oxidation wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 however we showed that the promoting effect of soil derived dom on smx oxidation was primarily ascribed to its polyphenolic content rather than its condensed aromatic content according to bulk and molecular level analyses of soil derived dom this finding implies that elucidation of the composition and characteristics of various dom types is critical for an improved understanding of their uncertain role in pollutant degradation globally frequent fire events and widespread usage of pyrogenic biomass e g biochar have greatly increased the amounts of heated soil derived dom in aquatic environments via rainwater runoff pellegrini et al 2022 stubbins et al 2015 dittmar and paeng 2009 lehmann 2007 druffel 2004 approximately 18 203 tg yr 1 of condensed aromatic components are estimated to enter the environment bostick et al 2018 these components comprise nearly 10 of the bulk doc in fluvial systems jaffé et al 2013 therefore the impact of condensed aromatic dom e g dissolved black carbon on pollutant fate and environmental quality has become an increasing environmental concern the inhibiting effect of condensed aromatic rich dom i e dom 400 implies that in biochar amended farmlands or wildfire prone regions the smx or smx like pollutants are expected to have greater persistence in soils and downstream waters however in our experiments dom from soil heated at 250 and 400 c had opposite effects on smx degradation possible promoting effect at ph 6 8 vs inhibiting effect at all ph levels respectively thus prescribed fires and low severity wildfires that are dominated by low temperature burning may have completely different environmental consequences than high severity wildfires therefore we urge that further studies on the environmental impacts of pyrogenic dom should carefully consider the extremely high chemo diversity of dom driven by different burning temperatures 4 conclusions in this study the role of dom in smx oxidation by mno2 under different ph environments was evaluated by studying dom types with distinct molecular compositions and concentrations the results demonstrated that smx oxidation could be either inhibited or promoted by dom depending on its composition and concentration and the environmental ph which reconciles the conflicting findings in previous studies our major conclusions are the following the overall role of soil derived dom in smx oxidation by mno2 was synergistically controlled by dom molecular composition concentration and environmental ph for a given dom type the role could switch from inhibition to promotion by increasing the dom concentration or environmental ph the promoting role of soil derived dom in smx oxidation by mno2 was primarily ascribed to the polyphenolics rather than condensed aromatics in dom according to bulk and molecular level analyses of dom molecular level characterization of dom can advance our understanding of dom impacts on pollutant transformation two concepts of critical dom concentration at a given ph can serve as indices to describe the dual role of dom and compare the impacts of dom type with additional data from future studies on the impacts of dom composition concentration and reaction conditions on pollutant degradation future modeling focused research may enable the prediction of pollutant fate in field

14913,biotransformation of emerging contaminants ecs is of importance in various natural and engineered systems to eliminate the adverse effects of ecs toward organisms in wastewater structurally similar ecs may transform through similar reactions triggered by common enzymes however the transformation pattern for them was scarcely studied to fill the research gaps five sulfonamides were chosen as the targeted ecs with similar structure to explore the transformation pattern in wastewater biological treatment experiments at lab scale through molecular networking based nontarget screening 45 transformation products tps of sulfonamides were identified and 14 of them were newly found on the basis five specific transformation patterns were summarized for sulfonamides by transformation pathways comparing reaction frequency analyzing and dominant tps comparing results suggested that pterin chelation and formylation dominant transformation pathway and acetylation methylation and deamination reactions were commonly occurred for sulfonamides in wastewater among them the role of formylation as the dominant transformation pathway for sulfonamides transformed in wastewater was firstly reported in present study subsequent frontier molecular orbital calculation suggested the active site of amino n1h2 may contribute the specific transformation pattern of sulfonamides present study reveals the specific transformation pattern of sulfonamides from the aspect of tps and transformation pathways in the future knowledge on the specific transformation pattern can be used to regulate and enhance the removal of a class of ecs with similar structure rather than just one of ecs graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sulfonamides transformation products transformation pattern wastewater molecular networking data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction emerging contaminants ecs such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products endocrine disrupter chemicals pesticides and industrial chemicals have emerged as a huge concern due to the potential adverse effects toward human beings jurado et al 2019 wastewater treatment plants wwtps are the major sinks of ecs discharging into downside water bodies removing ecs in wwtps is needed however the removal of ecs in wwtps is not satisfying presently nakada et al 2007 which was caused by the unclear removal mechanisms of ecs in wwtps hübner et al 2021 a piece of in depth knowledge on the biotic transformation processes of ecs is urgently needed at the fundamental level the removal of ecs depends on specific enzymes that catalyst the specific structures of ecs during the processes the biodegradable ecs will be structure changed step by step and finally be removed and mineralized to some extent rich et al 2021 revealing the transformation pathways and reactions participating in the transformation of ecs is of importance to understand the transformation mechanisms of ecs which will facilitate to regulate the parameters of wastewater treatment processes to enhance the removal of ecs identifying transformation products tps is the basis of revealing transformation pathways and key transformation reactions for ecs in wastewater rich et al 2021 wu et al 2020 nontarget screening based on liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry lchrms is the commonly used method on tps identification especially for unknown tps bletsou et al 2015 wu et al 2022 in view of the complexity of wastewater matrices the features detected from wastewater samples may be high up to tens of thousands proper strategy on prioritizing candidates tps features from such massive amount of features is needed li et al 2021b molecular networking is a novel nontarget strategy that can address this issue efficiently watrous et al 2012 the principle of molecular networking is that chemicals with similar structure will share similar fragmentation ions yu et al 2022 by organizing ms ms spectra through molecular networking chemicals with similar structure will be clustered into the same sub cluster generally tps formed during biological transformation processes are similar to the corresponding parent compounds schollee et al 2017 therefore through molecular networking the candidate tps features can be screened out as the nodes connecting with the corresponding parent compounds in a network map chung et al 2021 presently molecular networking has been used for drug metabolism studies and shown greater effectiveness yu et al 2022 the visual organization of ms ms spectra into network map will facilitate the structural elucidation of unknown tps quinn et al 2017 based on molecular networking strategy more novel tps are expected to be identified which will provide insights into the summarization of transformation pattern for structurally similar ecs in wastewater sulfonamides are the class of antimicrobial compounds

reported kokoszka et al 2021 from the aspect of chemical structure sulfonamides have similar structures composition consisting of amino n1h2 benzene moiety sulfonamide bridge so2 nh and r substituents hu et al 2022 since the biotransformation of chemicals is thought to be structure dependent there seem to be certain specific reaction pattern for sulfonamides transformed in wastewater previous studies have verified the hypothesis from the aspect of removal kinetic for example the removal of sulfonamides in wastewater was demonstrated to be srt dependent achermann et al 2018b however studies on the transformation pattern of sulfonamides in wastewater from the aspect of transformation pathways and reactions were limited hübner et al 2021 by summarizing the rule of transformation pathways for sulfonamides it will provide insights into the removal kinetic pattern of sulfonamides in wastewater and optimum environmental conditions for enhanced removal of sulfonamides in this study batch

the remained 20 nodes were considered as final candidate tps features for structure elucidation for structure elucidation nodes represented sulfonamides and known tps reported previously were firstly annotated as the seed nodes which facilitated to infer the unknown structure of neighboring nodes thus through retrieving related literatures of tps identification for sulfonamides achermann et al 2018a hu et al 2022 oliveira et al 2019 nodes of m z 307 085 321 1019 454 1393 264 0793 280 076 and 455 1236 were speculated as n formyl smt n acetyl smt dihydropterin smt deamination smt deamination hydroxylation smt and pto smt furthermore the identity of these nodes were deduced based on information of ms ms spectra and the detailed processes can be seen in text s6 based on these known structures of tps structure elucidation was implemented for neighboring unknown nodes for node of m z 293 1055 the score of the spectrum similarity with the neighboring nodes of m z 279 0912 referred to smt was 0 87 which suggested that the structure of m z 293 1055 can be highly similar to smt the calculated mass shift 14 014 implied methylation can participate in the formation of m z 293 1055 from smt further inspecting the ms ms spectra information the fragmentation of m z 225 0444 and 197 0502 suggested the deduction of nch2 which verified the methylation reaction at the location of nitrogen atom thus m z of 293 1055 was proposed as methylation smt at level 2b methylation smt was not found in previous studies while similar transformation reaction for amine containing ecs was reported by gulde et al 2016 based on similar processes structure elucidation for remained candidate tps features were implemented and the detailed information can be seen in text s6 collectively 11 tps were found in present study among them smt tp321 was identified at level 2a 8 tps were tentatively identified at level 2b and 2 tps were tentatively identified at level 3 three tps smt tp293 smt tp482 and smt tp483 were new tps that not reported in previous literatures taking the same workflows as smt tps identification for other 4 sulfonamides were implemented by molecular networking nontarget strategy the detailed processes of matched ms ms spectra and fragmentation ions can be seen fig s6 10 and table s4 respectively finally 7 10 7 and 10 tps were identified for smx smm stz and smz respectively among these tps 2 3 2 and 4 were new tps that has not been reported in previous literatures table s4 to fully understand the tps identified in different conditions and transformation processes the tps found in present study was comprehensively compared with results reported previously the tps of smx smt and stz were extensively studied while smm and smz were relatively scarcely studied previously hu et al 2022 puhlmann et al 2022 acetylated sulfonamides were mostly reported and have been found in mammal garcía galán et al 2008 plants hou et al 2019 poultry waste zhanteng et al 2021 wastewater achermann et al 2018a and surface water cui et al 2020 other than acetylated sulfonamides glycosylated sulfonamides were extensively found in mammal garcía galán et al 2008 further inspecting the tps formed during abiotic and biotic processes reported previously we found that most of tps such as formylated acetylated glycosylated and pterin conjugates of sulfonamides were formed through biotic transformation reactions garcía galán et al 2008 while smt tp313 formed through chlorination reaction may be from abiotic transformation processes because chlorinated sulfonamides were frequently detected in chlorination disinfection processes while scarcely detected in biotic treatment systems xia et al 2023 thus the transformation patterns of sulfonamides speculated in the following can be regarded to be contributed by abiotic transformation processes 3 2 transformation pathway exploration of sulfonamides in wastewater based on the structure logic of tps and parent compounds transformation pathways of five sulfonamides were proposed as fig 2 smt was taken as an example to illustrate the transformation processes of sulfonamides in wastewater as shown in fig 2 a 11 tps can be grouped into 6 pathways deamination to smt tp264 and subsequent hydroxylation to smt tp280 constituted in the pathway ι deamination was previously found for smt transformed in horizontal flow anaerobic immobilized biomass bioreactor oliveira et al 2019 hydroxylation was assumed to be catalyzed by ammonia oxidizers zhou et al 2019 the pathway ⅱ consisted of n methylation and carboxylation n methylation was previously found for amine containing ecs including smt transformed in activated sludge achermann et al 2018a gulde et al 2016 to the best of our knowledge carboxylation has not yet been found for smt but was found for smm transformed in granular sludge li et al 2023 formylation to smt tp307 and acetylation to smt tp321 constituted in the pathway ⅲ and ⅳ respectively these two reactions has been extensively found for sulfonamides included smt transformed in biological treatment systems achermann et al 2018a hübner et al 2021 in addition the concentration of n acetylation smt was found to be comparable to smt in wwtps cui et al 2020 for pathway ⅴ chlorination reaction caused the formation of smt tp313 chlorination of smt has been previously reported during chlorination disinfection processes in wwtps garcía galán et al 2008 xia et al 2023 during this processes the site of amino for smt was found to be easily reacted with the oxidative species of hocl and clo in the present study the reason for chlorination reaction occur may be that nh4cl was added as the nutrient substance for activated sludge and the accumulation of chloridion during the experiment the pathway ⅵ consisted of dihydropterin smt tp454 and subsequent formylation smt tp482 smt tp483 and oxidation smt tp455 reactions although dihydropterin and oxidation have been found to be the dominant pathway for smt transformed in activated sludge the further formylation of smt tp454 and smt tp453 have not yet been reported these newly found transformation reactions complement our understanding on the transformation process of smt in activated sludge in view of that sulfonamides have also been extensively studied in advanced oxidation processes the transformation reactions between biotic and chemical processes were compared to reveal the specific and common reactions in different systems in chemical processes hydroxylation mainly occurred at the site of amino moiety and benzene moiety the cleavage of s n and s c bonds and the ring cleavage causing by the attack of hydroxyl radical were common reactions and extensively found for the transformation of sulfonamides hu et al 2022 ji et al 2017 while these reactions were scarcely found for sulfonamides transformed in biotic treatment systems wang et al 2021 by inspecting the transformation pathways of these 5 sulfonamides we found the representative reactions for sulfonamides were formylation acetylation demethylation and pterin conjugates achermann et al 2018a puhlmann et al 2022 these suggested that the significant difference for transformation reactions between biotic and chemical processes in addition these results also confirms the hypothesis that there are certain reaction rule for the transformation of sulfonamides in wastewater we mentioned in the section of introduction to further elucidate the reaction rules all the transformation reactions and tps involved in the transformation processes of 5 sulfonamides were comprehensively analyzed 3 3 transformation pattern for sulfonamides in wastewater 3 3 1 similar transformation reactions to assess the role of different reactions on the transformation of sulfonamides the frequency of each reaction for 5 sulfonamides was summarized as fig 3 the records for reactions such as acetylation carboxylation chlorination deamination formylation glucose chelation hydrogenation hydroxylation methylation oxidation and pterin chelation were 4 1 1 5 17 2 1 7 9 12 and 21 respectively among these reactions acetylation deamination formylation hydroxylation methylation oxidation and pterin chelation participated in the transformation of almost all five sulfonamides in addition the reaction sites of these transformation reactions for five sulfonamides were basically identical for example acetylation deamination methylation and pterin chelation all participated in the primary transformation of sulfonamides at the site of n1h2 hydroxylation hydroxylation for deamination tps and oxidation oxidation for pterin chelation tps mainly involved in the secondary transformation however formylation was observed to participate in both primary and secondary transformation reactions for sulfonamides from smt tp455 to smt tp483 it should be noted that pterin chelation 21 records and formylation 17 records occurred most frequently during the processes of sulfonamides transformed in activated sludge which implied that these two reactions may play important role for sulfonamides transformed in wastewater previously achermann et al 2018a found pterin chelation was the major transformation pathway for sulfonamides in activated sludge system hübner et al 2021 suggested that pterin chelation was the initial reaction for sulfonamides which caused the consistency for removal kinetic among different sulfonamides in bio filtration systems these results consistently verified the important role of pterin chelation during the transformation processes of sulfonamides however comparing with pterin chelation formylation has not yet received enough attention although it has been found for sulfonamides transformed in wastewater achermann et al 2018a achermann et al 2018b hübner et al 2021 herein formylation reaction was found to frequently occur for the transformation of sulfonamides and speculated as an important transformation reaction for sulfonamides the detailed role of formylation reaction for sulfonamides transformation worth to be further studied it should be noted that certain reactions cannot be acquired by the methods of frequency analysis taken in present study for example some transformation reactions such as hydrolysis were assumed to be too fast to be observed in addition as the results of recovery rate of spe not all the chemicals can be extracted by the column of spe therefore the conclusion for dominant transformation reactions obtained by frequency analysis should be further validated from other aspects 3 3 2 major transformation products the formation of tps was directly caused by certain transformation reactions to further verify the crucial role of pterin chelation and formylation peak areas of pterin chelated sulfonamides and formylated sulfonamides were compared with peak area of tps formed through other transformation reactions fig 4 an interesting phenomenon is that pterin chelation and formylation tps were the almost two intensity wise dominant tps for all the five sulfonamides for examples other than formylation smz ranked 3rd among the 12 tps all pterin chelation and formylation tps ranked at the top two for peak area of tps formed from the corresponding sulfonamides in view of that the peak area is not equal to the concentration for tps the ionization efficiency for identified tps were predicted by random forest models to estimate the concentration of each tps and importance of each transformation pathway the source of data for training set and the processes of developing the models can be seen in table s7 the developed models performs relatively well on the test set data with r2 of 0 51 and rmse of 0 79 respectively hou et al 2020 fig s11 based on random forest models the predicted ionization efficiency for tps can be seen in table s8 comparing with the measured ionization efficiency of acetyl smx 0 7 compared with smx achermann et al 2018a the predicted results of 0 93 suggested the high accuracy thus the models of ionization efficiency was used to estimate the concentration tps by comparing the estimated concentration of tps we found pterin chelated and formylated sulfonamides were the dominant tps this further suggested that the crucial role of pterin chelation and formylation for sulfonamides transformed in wastewater previously pterin chelation were observed to be as the dominant pathway for sulfonamides transformed in wastewater achermann et al 2018a while present study further pointed out the importance of formylation for sulfonamides although formylation has been observed for sulfonamides in wastewater previously the results of formylation as the dominant transformation pathway for sulfonamides were scarcely reported these knowledge can be used to regulate the removal of sulfonamides in wastewater in the future 3 3 3 proposed specific transformation pattern in view of the consistency for the transformation reactions and major tps summarized above the specific transformation pattern for sulfonamides during wastewater biological treatment processes was proposed as fig 5 in wastewater the dominant transformation for sulfonamides were pterin chelation and formylation these two transformation reactions can be observed for all five sulfonamides in present study and other sulfonamides such as sulfadiazine achermann et al 2018a sulfapyridine and sulfisoxazole kokoszka et al 2021 in addition the highly estimated concentration for tps of formylation and pterin chelation sulfonamides suggested that pterin chelation and formylation reactions may be kinetically rapid transformation reactions in wastewater pterin chelation reaction occurred when sulfonamides interact with their target enzyme to inhibit folic acid synthesis of microbes achermann et al 2018a the role of pterin chelation as the dominant pathway contributing to the removal of sulfonamides in wastewater has been revealed by achermann et al 2018a for formylation reaction although similar transformation reactions have been observed for sulfonamides achermann et al 2018a oliveira et al 2019 the importance of them as the major transformation reaction has not yet been reported previously other than the dominant transformation pathway of sulfonamides acetylation methylation and deamination reactions were summarized as the specific transformation pathway for all sulfonamides in wastewater previously acetylation for sulfonamides has been extensively studied and many acetylated tps of sulfonamides such as acetylated smx acetylated smz and acetylated sulfaquinoxaline have been detected in wastewater samples kokoszka et al 2021 wang et al 2021 zhanteng et al 2021 herein we further validated that acetylation reaction participated in the primary transformation of almost all sulfonamides for deamination kennes veiga et al 2021 suggested that it may performed by the amine oxidase however amine oxidase was found in multiple organisms controlling the level of amines and the corresponding factors affect the activity of it has not been revealed for methylation similar reactions have been found for other sulfonamides and amine contained chemicals during wastewater biological treatment processes gulde et al 2016 hu et al 2022 however the responsible enzyme has not yet been found and deserved to be further studied in the future it should be noted that certain tps with low concentration may not be ionized to be detected for these tps the structure of them cannot be elucidated by molecular networking nontarget strategy in the future more sensitive instruments of hrms should be developed to meet the detection of chemicals with low concentration in environmental matrices 3 3 4 frontier molecular orbital calculations for likely reactions site of sulfonamides for all specific transformation pattern summarized as fig 5 we found that the reaction sites of them were all located in the n1h2 of sulfonamides this suggested that n1h2 of sulfonamides may be the active site that was easily catalyzed by enzyme during wastewater biological treatment processes to verify this assumption frontier molecular orbital calculations based on dft was employed to explain the reaction site of sulfonamides based on frontier molecular orbital theory atom with a higher fedhomo 2 fedlumo 2 value is vulnerable to attack by free radicals while atoms with a higher 2fedhomo 2 is prone to nucleophilic reaction li et al 2021a qu et al 2015 after optimization of molecular configuration the calculated results of frontier electron densities for smt are shown in fig 6 in the fig 6 d the site of atom for 28 n has the largest 2fedhomo 2 value 0 47506 which was great larger than other site of atom 0 31962 for all other atoms for fedhomo 2 fedlumo 2 the site of atom for 28 n also exhibited largest value of 0 23781 0 21784 for all other atoms these suggested that the site of 28 n namely n1h2 of sulfonamides was where smt most likely to react further inspecting the frontier electron densities for other sulfonamides fig s12 s15 table s6 we found the site of n1h2 were within largest value of 2fedhomo 2 for all sulfonamides other than stz 0 22766 ranked second slightly less than the maximum of 0 24558 for the value of fedhomo 2 fedlumo 2 the site of n1h2 ranked second 0 23963 slightly less than the maximum of 0 24183 second 0 30336 slightly less than the maximum of 0 30471 first 0 31008 and fourth 0 16255 ranked second slightly less than the maximum of 0 18151 for smz smx smm and stz these results verified that the active site of n1h2 for sulfonamides 3 4 implication for the strategies of enhanced removal for sulfonamides in wastewater in present study the specific transformation pattern including dominant transformation pathways pterin chelation and formylation and common transformation pathways acetylation methylation and deamination were summarized for sulfonamides transformed in wastewater the specific transformation pattern especially for the dominant transformation pathways can be used to enhance the removal of sulfonamides in wwtps the dominant pathway of pterin chelation was presumably to be catalyzed by dihydropteroate synthase which is a common enzyme that harbor by almost all the microbes achermann et al 2018b therefore enhancing the overall biomass of treatment systems will benefit the removal of sulfonamides in wastewater thus some strategies that can enhance the biomass such as longer srt higher concentration of do higher concentration of biodegradable carbon source can enhance the removal of sulfonamides hübner et al 2021 for formylation kennes veiga et al 2021 suggested that the responsible enzyme is n acyltransferases however the strategies enhancing the activity of n acyltransferases in wwtps have not yet been revealed which deserves to be further studied other than enhancing the removal of these 5 sulfonamides the transformation patterns summarized in present study can be used to regulate the removal of other structurally similar chemicals similar to sulfonamides in the future more transformation patterns for ecs should be revealed which will benefit to enhance the removal of more structurally similar ecs by regulating the dominant transformation pathways 4 conclusions in this study transformation pattern of five sulfonamides were explored based on results of identified tps by molecular networking nontarget screening the main conclusions of this study are as follows 1 45 tps of sulfonamides were identified by molecular networking nontarget screening 14 tps among them were newly found in present study 2 five specific transformation patterns included pterin chelation and formylation dominant transformation pathway and acetylation methylation and deamination reactions common transformation pathway were summarized for sulfonamides transformed in wastewater among them the role of formylation as the dominant transformation pathway for sulfonamides transformed in wastewater was firstly reported in present study 3 the active site of amino n1h2

14913,biotransformation of emerging contaminants ecs is of importance in various natural and engineered systems to eliminate the adverse effects of ecs toward organisms in wastewater structurally similar ecs may transform through similar reactions triggered by common enzymes however the transformation pattern for them was scarcely studied to fill the research gaps five sulfonamides were chosen as the targeted ecs with similar structure to explore the transformation pattern in wastewater biological treatment experiments at lab scale through molecular networking based nontarget screening 45 transformation products tps of sulfonamides were identified and 14 of them were newly found on the basis five specific transformation patterns were summarized for sulfonamides by transformation pathways comparing reaction frequency analyzing and dominant tps comparing results suggested that pterin chelation and formylation dominant transformation pathway and acetylation methylation and deamination reactions were commonly occurred for sulfonamides in wastewater among them the role of formylation as the dominant transformation pathway for sulfonamides transformed in wastewater was firstly reported in present study subsequent frontier molecular orbital calculation suggested the active site of amino n1h2 may contribute the specific transformation pattern of sulfonamides present study reveals the specific transformation pattern of sulfonamides from the aspect of tps and transformation pathways in the future knowledge on the specific transformation pattern can be used to regulate and enhance the removal of a class of ecs with similar structure rather than just one of ecs graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sulfonamides transformation products transformation pattern wastewater molecular networking data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction emerging contaminants ecs such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products endocrine disrupter chemicals pesticides and industrial chemicals have emerged as a huge concern due to the potential adverse effects toward human beings jurado et al 2019 wastewater treatment plants wwtps are the major sinks of ecs discharging into downside water bodies removing ecs in wwtps is needed however the removal of ecs in wwtps is not satisfying presently nakada et al 2007 which was caused by the unclear removal mechanisms of ecs in wwtps hübner et al 2021 a piece of in depth knowledge on the biotic transformation processes of ecs is urgently needed at the fundamental level the removal of ecs depends on specific enzymes that catalyst the specific structures of ecs during the processes the biodegradable ecs will be structure changed step by step and finally be removed and mineralized to some extent rich et al 2021 revealing the transformation pathways and reactions participating in the transformation of ecs is of importance to understand the transformation mechanisms of ecs which will facilitate to regulate the parameters of wastewater treatment processes to enhance the removal of ecs identifying transformation products tps is the basis of revealing transformation pathways and key transformation reactions for ecs in wastewater rich et al 2021 wu et al 2020 nontarget screening based on liquid chromatography high resolution mass spectrometry lchrms is the commonly used method on tps identification especially for unknown tps bletsou et al 2015 wu et al 2022 in view of the complexity of wastewater matrices the features detected from wastewater samples may be high up to tens of thousands proper strategy on prioritizing candidates tps features from such massive amount of features is needed li et al 2021b molecular networking is a novel nontarget strategy that can address this issue efficiently watrous et al 2012 the principle of molecular networking is that chemicals with similar structure will share similar fragmentation ions yu et al 2022 by organizing ms ms spectra through molecular networking chemicals with similar structure will be clustered into the same sub cluster generally tps formed during biological transformation processes are similar to the corresponding parent compounds schollee et al 2017 therefore through molecular networking the candidate tps features can be screened out as the nodes connecting with the corresponding parent compounds in a network map chung et al 2021 presently molecular networking has been used for drug metabolism studies and shown greater effectiveness yu et al 2022 the visual organization of ms ms spectra into network map will facilitate the structural elucidation of unknown tps quinn et al 2017 based on molecular networking strategy more novel tps are expected to be identified which will provide insights into the summarization of transformation pattern for structurally similar ecs in wastewater sulfonamides are the class of antimicrobial compounds commonly used in human and veterinary medicine the adverse effects of sulfonamides such as the potential toxicity to organisms and the spread of antibiotic resistance genes have been extensively reported kokoszka et al 2021 from the aspect of chemical structure sulfonamides have similar structures composition consisting of amino n1h2 benzene moiety sulfonamide bridge so2 nh and r substituents hu et al 2022 since the biotransformation of chemicals is thought to be structure dependent there seem to be certain specific reaction pattern for sulfonamides transformed in wastewater previous studies have verified the hypothesis from the aspect of removal kinetic for example the removal of sulfonamides in wastewater was demonstrated to be srt dependent achermann et al 2018b however studies on the transformation pattern of sulfonamides in wastewater from the aspect of transformation pathways and reactions were limited hübner et al 2021 by summarizing the rule of transformation pathways for sulfonamides it will provide insights into the removal kinetic pattern of sulfonamides in wastewater and optimum environmental conditions for enhanced removal of sulfonamides in this study batch experiments and molecular networking nontarget strategy were taken to explore the transformation pathways of five commonly used sulfonamides in wastewater the five sulfonamides were sulfadimidine smt sulfamethoxazole smx sulfamerazine smz sulfamonomethoxine smm and sulfathiazole stz they were chosen based on the frequent detection in wastewater and the structural similarity with structural similarity above 0 7 with each other oberoi et al 2019 present study will deepen our understanding on the detailed removal processes and transformation pattern of sulfonamides in wastewater which can be used to optimum environmental conditions for enhancing the removal of sulfonamides in wastewater 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and consumes the reference standards of 5 sulfanilamide are

2 batch experiments lab scale batch experiments were implemented to obtain samples for tps identification briefly activated sludge were freshly sampled from the aeration tank of a municipal wwtp of nanjing china firstly after aerating for 12 h activated sludge slurry were diluted to 2000 mg l and incubated in 2 l beakers wrapped in aluminum foil with a reaction volume of 1 l the do concentration was maintained at 2 5 mg l by controlling the air flow rates regulating the scale of rotor flowmeter the ph was maintained at 7 5 0 05 by automatically adding nahco3 stock solution 500 mg l the targeted pharmaceuticals were added to 50 μg l in experiment group rather than control group to avoid the dilemma that it was difficult to distinguish the identified tps was from which sulfonamide each sulfonamide were added separately to the experimental group for batch test the cod and nh4 n stock solutions were initially added to 300 and 15 mg l respectively and further added every 12 h at the same load during the experimental process samples were collected by filtering through a 0 45 μm pore size filter xinya shanghai china with 20 ml at time points of 0 0 0 5 2 0 8 0 12 0 24 0 48 0 72

by molecular network based non targeted screening through molecular networking nontarget methods on data processing the whole map of networks included 11 555 16 823 17 338 17 004 and 16 971 nodes for smt smx smz smm and stz fig s1 5 further searching the site of nodes represented the five sulfonamides from networks the sub clusters representing the candidates tps features composed of 27 26 17 21 and 15 nodes for smt smx smm stz and smz were found respectively fig 1 taking smt as an example to show the tps identification processes for the preliminary 27 candidates tps features some redundant features may be included which should be filtered to reduce the workloads of subsequent structure elucidation based on methods introduced in text s5 4 nodes m z 379 1068 323 1182 323 2262 and 425 1617 colored as purple 2 nodes m z 315 0492 281 0879 colored as pink 1 node colored as cyan m z 306 0592 were proposed as false positive features isomers and in source fragmentation and were filtered thus the remained 20 nodes were considered as final candidate tps features for structure elucidation for structure elucidation nodes represented sulfonamides and known tps reported previously were firstly annotated as the seed nodes which facilitated to infer the unknown structure of neighboring nodes thus through retrieving related literatures of tps identification for sulfonamides achermann et al 2018a hu et al 2022 oliveira et al 2019 nodes of m z 307 085 321 1019 454 1393 264 0793 280 076 and 455 1236 were speculated as n formyl smt n acetyl smt dihydropterin smt deamination smt deamination hydroxylation smt and pto smt furthermore the identity of these nodes were deduced based on information of ms ms spectra and the detailed processes can be seen in text s6 based on these known structures of tps structure elucidation was implemented for neighboring unknown nodes for node of m z 293 1055 the score of the spectrum similarity with the neighboring nodes of m z 279 0912 referred to smt was 0 87 which suggested that the structure of m z 293 1055 can be highly similar to smt the calculated mass shift 14 014 implied methylation can participate in the formation of m z 293 1055 from smt further inspecting the ms ms spectra information the fragmentation of m z 225 0444 and 197 0502 suggested the deduction of nch2 which verified the methylation reaction at the location of nitrogen atom thus m z of 293 1055 was proposed as methylation smt at level 2b methylation smt was not found in previous studies while similar transformation reaction for amine containing ecs was reported by gulde et al 2016 based on similar processes structure elucidation for remained candidate tps features were implemented and the detailed information can be seen in text s6 collectively 11 tps were found in present study among them smt tp321 was identified at level 2a 8 tps were tentatively identified at level 2b and 2 tps were tentatively identified at level 3 three tps smt tp293 smt tp482 and smt tp483 were new tps that not reported in previous literatures taking the same workflows as smt tps identification for other 4 sulfonamides were implemented by molecular networking nontarget strategy the detailed processes of matched ms ms spectra and fragmentation ions can be seen fig s6 10 and table s4 respectively finally 7 10 7 and 10 tps were identified for smx smm stz and smz respectively among these tps 2 3 2 and 4 were new tps that has not been reported in previous literatures table s4 to fully understand the tps identified in different conditions and transformation processes the tps found in present study was comprehensively compared with results reported previously the tps of smx smt and stz were extensively studied while smm and smz were relatively scarcely studied previously hu et al 2022 puhlmann et al 2022 acetylated sulfonamides were mostly reported and have been found in mammal garcía galán et al 2008 plants hou et al 2019 poultry waste zhanteng et al 2021 wastewater achermann et al 2018a and surface water cui et al 2020 other than acetylated sulfonamides glycosylated sulfonamides were extensively found in mammal garcía galán et al 2008 further inspecting the tps formed during abiotic and biotic processes reported previously we found that most of tps such as formylated acetylated glycosylated and pterin conjugates of sulfonamides were formed through biotic transformation reactions garcía galán et al 2008 while smt tp313 formed through chlorination reaction may be from abiotic transformation processes because chlorinated sulfonamides were frequently detected in chlorination disinfection processes while scarcely detected in biotic treatment systems xia et al 2023 thus the transformation patterns of sulfonamides speculated in the following can be regarded to be contributed by abiotic transformation processes 3 2 transformation pathway exploration of sulfonamides in wastewater based on the structure logic of tps and parent compounds transformation pathways of five sulfonamides were proposed as fig 2 smt was taken as an example to illustrate the transformation processes of sulfonamides in wastewater as shown in fig 2 a 11 tps can be grouped into 6 pathways deamination to smt tp264 and subsequent hydroxylation to smt tp280 constituted in the pathway ι deamination was previously found for smt transformed in horizontal flow anaerobic immobilized biomass bioreactor oliveira et al 2019 hydroxylation was assumed to be catalyzed by ammonia oxidizers zhou et al 2019 the pathway ⅱ consisted of n methylation and carboxylation n methylation was previously found for amine containing ecs including smt transformed in activated sludge achermann et al 2018a gulde et al 2016 to the best of our knowledge carboxylation has not yet been found for smt but was found for smm transformed in granular sludge li et al 2023 formylation to smt tp307 and acetylation to smt tp321 constituted in the pathway ⅲ and ⅳ respectively these two reactions has been extensively found for sulfonamides included smt transformed in biological treatment systems achermann et al 2018a hübner et al 2021 in addition the concentration of n acetylation smt was found to be comparable to smt in wwtps cui et al 2020 for pathway ⅴ chlorination reaction caused the formation of smt tp313 chlorination of smt has been previously reported during chlorination disinfection processes in wwtps garcía galán et al 2008 xia et al 2023 during this processes the site of amino for smt was found to be easily reacted with the oxidative species of hocl and clo in the present study the reason for chlorination reaction occur may be that nh4cl was added as the nutrient substance for activated sludge and the accumulation of chloridion during the experiment the pathway ⅵ consisted of dihydropterin smt tp454 and subsequent formylation smt tp482 smt tp483 and oxidation smt tp455 reactions although dihydropterin and oxidation have been found to be the dominant pathway for smt transformed in activated sludge the further formylation of smt tp454 and smt tp453 have not yet been reported these newly found transformation reactions complement our understanding on the transformation process of smt in activated sludge in view of that sulfonamides have also been extensively studied in advanced oxidation processes the transformation reactions between biotic and chemical processes were compared to reveal the specific and common reactions in different systems in chemical processes hydroxylation mainly occurred at the site of amino moiety and benzene moiety the cleavage of s n and s c bonds and the ring cleavage causing by the attack of hydroxyl radical were common reactions and extensively found for the transformation of sulfonamides hu et al 2022 ji et al 2017 while these reactions were scarcely found for sulfonamides transformed in biotic treatment systems wang et al 2021 by inspecting the transformation pathways of these 5 sulfonamides we found the representative reactions for sulfonamides were formylation acetylation demethylation and pterin conjugates achermann et al 2018a puhlmann et al 2022 these suggested that the significant difference for transformation reactions between biotic and chemical processes in addition these results also confirms the hypothesis that there are certain reaction rule for the transformation of sulfonamides in wastewater we mentioned in the section of introduction to further elucidate the reaction rules all the transformation reactions and tps involved in the transformation processes of 5 sulfonamides were comprehensively analyzed 3 3 transformation pattern for sulfonamides in wastewater 3 3 1 similar transformation reactions to assess the role of different reactions on the transformation of sulfonamides the frequency of each reaction for 5 sulfonamides was summarized as fig 3 the records for reactions such as acetylation carboxylation chlorination deamination formylation glucose chelation hydrogenation hydroxylation methylation oxidation and pterin chelation were 4 1 1 5 17 2 1 7 9 12 and 21 respectively among these reactions acetylation deamination formylation hydroxylation methylation oxidation and pterin chelation participated in the transformation of almost all five sulfonamides in addition the reaction sites of these transformation reactions for five sulfonamides were basically identical for example acetylation deamination methylation and pterin chelation all participated in the primary transformation of sulfonamides at the site of n1h2 hydroxylation hydroxylation for deamination tps and oxidation oxidation for pterin chelation tps mainly involved in the secondary transformation however formylation was observed to participate in both primary and secondary transformation reactions for sulfonamides from smt tp455 to smt tp483 it should be noted that pterin chelation 21 records and formylation 17 records occurred most frequently during the processes of sulfonamides transformed in activated sludge which implied that these two reactions may play important role for sulfonamides transformed in wastewater previously achermann et al 2018a found pterin chelation was the major transformation pathway for sulfonamides in activated sludge system hübner et al 2021 suggested that pterin chelation was the initial reaction for sulfonamides which caused the consistency for removal kinetic among different sulfonamides in bio filtration systems these results consistently verified the important role of pterin chelation during the transformation processes of sulfonamides however comparing with pterin chelation formylation has not yet received enough attention although it has been found for sulfonamides transformed in wastewater achermann et al 2018a achermann et al 2018b hübner et al 2021 herein formylation reaction was found to frequently occur for the transformation of sulfonamides and speculated as an important transformation reaction for sulfonamides the detailed role of formylation reaction for sulfonamides transformation worth to be further studied it should be noted that certain reactions cannot be acquired by the methods of frequency analysis taken in present study for example some transformation reactions such as hydrolysis were assumed to be too fast to be observed in addition as the results of recovery rate of spe not all the chemicals can be extracted by the column of spe therefore the conclusion for dominant transformation reactions obtained by frequency analysis should be further validated from other aspects 3 3 2 major transformation products the formation of tps was directly caused by certain transformation reactions to further verify the crucial role of pterin chelation and formylation peak areas of pterin chelated sulfonamides and formylated sulfonamides were compared with peak area of tps formed through other transformation reactions fig 4 an interesting phenomenon is that pterin chelation and formylation tps were the almost two intensity wise dominant tps for all the five sulfonamides for examples other than formylation smz ranked 3rd among the 12 tps all pterin chelation and formylation tps ranked at the top two for peak area of tps formed from the corresponding sulfonamides in view of that the peak area is not equal to the concentration for tps the ionization efficiency for identified tps were predicted by random forest models to estimate the concentration of each tps and importance of each transformation pathway the source of data for training set and the processes of developing the models can be seen in table s7 the developed models performs relatively well on the test set data with r2 of 0 51 and rmse of 0 79 respectively hou et al 2020 fig s11 based on random forest models the predicted ionization efficiency for tps can be seen in table s8 comparing with the measured ionization efficiency of acetyl smx 0 7 compared with smx achermann et al 2018a the predicted results of 0 93 suggested the high accuracy thus the models of ionization efficiency was used to estimate the concentration tps by comparing the estimated concentration of tps we found pterin chelated and formylated sulfonamides were the dominant tps this further suggested that the crucial role of pterin chelation and formylation for sulfonamides transformed in wastewater previously pterin chelation were observed to be as the dominant pathway for sulfonamides transformed in wastewater achermann et al 2018a while present study further pointed out the importance of formylation for sulfonamides although formylation has been observed for sulfonamides in wastewater previously the results of formylation as the dominant transformation pathway for sulfonamides were scarcely reported these knowledge can be used to regulate the removal of sulfonamides in wastewater in the future 3 3 3 proposed specific transformation pattern in view of the consistency for the transformation reactions and major tps summarized above the specific transformation pattern for sulfonamides during wastewater biological treatment processes was proposed as fig 5 in wastewater the dominant transformation for sulfonamides were pterin chelation and formylation these two transformation reactions can be observed for all five sulfonamides in present study and other sulfonamides such as sulfadiazine achermann et al 2018a sulfapyridine and sulfisoxazole kokoszka et al 2021 in addition the highly estimated concentration for tps of formylation and pterin chelation sulfonamides suggested that pterin chelation and formylation reactions may be kinetically rapid transformation reactions in wastewater pterin chelation reaction occurred when sulfonamides interact with their target enzyme to inhibit folic acid synthesis of microbes achermann et al 2018a the role of pterin chelation as the dominant pathway contributing to the removal of sulfonamides in wastewater has been revealed by achermann et al 2018a for formylation reaction although similar transformation reactions have been observed for sulfonamides achermann et al 2018a oliveira et al 2019 the importance of them as the major transformation reaction has not yet been reported previously other than the dominant transformation pathway of sulfonamides acetylation methylation and deamination reactions were summarized as the specific transformation pathway for all sulfonamides in wastewater previously acetylation for sulfonamides has been extensively studied and many acetylated tps of sulfonamides such as acetylated smx acetylated smz and acetylated sulfaquinoxaline have been detected in wastewater samples kokoszka et al 2021 wang et al 2021 zhanteng et al 2021 herein we further validated that acetylation reaction participated in the primary transformation of almost all sulfonamides for deamination kennes veiga et al 2021 suggested that it may performed by the amine oxidase however amine oxidase was found in multiple organisms controlling the level of amines and the corresponding factors affect the activity of it has not been revealed for methylation similar reactions have been found for other sulfonamides and amine contained chemicals during wastewater biological treatment processes gulde et al 2016 hu et al 2022 however the responsible enzyme has not yet been found and deserved to be further studied in the future it should be noted that certain tps with low concentration may not be ionized to be detected for these tps the structure of them cannot be elucidated by molecular networking nontarget strategy in the future more sensitive instruments of hrms should be developed to meet the detection of chemicals with low concentration in environmental matrices 3 3 4 frontier molecular orbital calculations for likely reactions site of sulfonamides for all specific transformation pattern summarized as fig 5 we found that the reaction sites of them were all located in the n1h2 of sulfonamides this suggested that n1h2 of sulfonamides may be the active site that was easily catalyzed by enzyme during wastewater biological treatment processes to verify this assumption frontier molecular orbital calculations based on dft was employed to explain the reaction site of sulfonamides based on frontier molecular orbital theory atom with a higher fedhomo 2 fedlumo 2 value is vulnerable to attack by free radicals while atoms with a higher 2fedhomo 2 is prone to nucleophilic reaction li et al 2021a qu et al 2015 after optimization of molecular configuration the calculated results of frontier electron densities for smt are shown in fig 6 in the fig 6 d the site of atom for 28 n has the largest 2fedhomo 2 value 0 47506 which was great larger than other site of atom 0 31962 for all other atoms for fedhomo 2 fedlumo 2 the site of atom for 28 n also exhibited largest value of 0 23781 0 21784 for all other atoms these suggested that the site of 28 n namely n1h2 of sulfonamides was where smt most likely to react further inspecting the frontier electron densities for other sulfonamides fig s12 s15 table s6 we found the site of n1h2 were within largest value of 2fedhomo 2 for all sulfonamides other than stz 0 22766 ranked second slightly less than the maximum of 0 24558 for the value of fedhomo 2 fedlumo 2 the site of n1h2 ranked second 0 23963 slightly less than the maximum of 0 24183 second 0 30336 slightly less than the maximum of 0 30471 first 0 31008 and fourth 0 16255 ranked second slightly less than the maximum of 0 18151 for smz smx smm and stz these results verified that the active site of n1h2 for sulfonamides 3 4 implication for the strategies of enhanced removal for sulfonamides in wastewater in present study the specific transformation pattern including dominant transformation pathways pterin chelation and formylation and common transformation pathways acetylation methylation and deamination were summarized for sulfonamides transformed in wastewater the specific transformation pattern especially for the dominant transformation pathways can be used to enhance the removal of sulfonamides in wwtps the dominant pathway of pterin chelation was presumably to be catalyzed by dihydropteroate synthase which is a common enzyme that harbor by almost all the microbes achermann et al 2018b therefore enhancing the overall biomass of treatment systems will benefit the removal of sulfonamides in wastewater thus some strategies that can enhance the biomass such as longer srt higher concentration of do higher concentration of biodegradable carbon source can enhance the removal of sulfonamides hübner et al 2021 for formylation kennes veiga et al 2021 suggested that the responsible enzyme is n acyltransferases however the strategies enhancing the activity of n acyltransferases in wwtps have not yet been revealed which deserves to be further studied other than enhancing the removal of these 5 sulfonamides the transformation patterns summarized in present study can be used to regulate the removal of other structurally similar chemicals similar to sulfonamides in the future more transformation patterns for ecs should be revealed which will benefit to enhance the removal of more structurally similar ecs by regulating the dominant transformation pathways 4 conclusions in this study transformation pattern of five sulfonamides were explored based on results of identified tps by molecular networking nontarget screening the main conclusions of this study are as follows 1 45 tps of sulfonamides were identified by molecular networking nontarget screening 14 tps among them were newly found in present study 2 five specific transformation patterns included pterin chelation and formylation dominant transformation pathway and acetylation methylation and deamination reactions common transformation pathway were summarized for sulfonamides transformed in wastewater among them the role of formylation as the dominant transformation pathway for sulfonamides transformed in wastewater was firstly reported in present study 3 the active site of amino n1h2

14914,understanding the composition transformation and bioactivity of dissolved organic matter dom at the molecular level is crucial for investigating the hydrothermal humification process of wastewater sludge and producing ecological fertilizers in this study dom transformation pathways under alkali thermal humification treatment aht were characterized by fourier transform ion cyclotron

wastewater sludge humification process aht produced maximum amounts of protein 3260 56 mg l and humic acid 5788 24 mg l after 12 h ft icr ms results indicated that protein like structures were prone to continuous oxidation and were ultimately transformed into aromatic n containing compounds resembling humic substances several reactive fragments such as c2h2o2 c3h4o2 and c4h6o2 formed by the maillard reaction mr were identified as potential precursors to humic acid ha in terms of biological effects dom12h showed the highest rice germination and growth activity whereas that produced by aht for a longer period 12 h displayed phytotoxicity owing to the accumulation of toxic substances plant biostimulants such as amino acids and has in dom improved energy metabolism and carbohydrate storage in rice seedlings by upregulating the starch and sucrose metabolism pathways toxic substances such as pyrrole pyridine and melanoidin in dom can activate cell walls formation to inhibit abiotic stimuli in rice seedlings through the biosynthesis of phenylpropanoid pathway these findings provide a theoretical basis for optimizing sludge hydrothermal humification and recovering high quality liquid fertilizers graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dissolved organic matter hydrothermal humification treatment molecular reaction network rice seedling data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction sludge generated from wastewater biotreatment poses a series of critical problems owing to production volume high cost of treatment potential secondary environmental pollution and must undergo stabilized treatment before final disposal lu et al 2020 wang et al 2019 biotreatment is a popular method for sludge stabilization that converts putrescible organics such as proteins carbohydrates and lipids into humic substances kills pathogenic bacteria and recycles value added humic substances and methane rich biogas yang and antonietti 2020 aerobic composting and anaerobic digestion are mainstream technologies for sludge biological stabilization treatment hu et al 2022 however considering the long operating process complicated microbial response and nitrogen erosion it is still difficult to comply with the requirements for oriented conversion of humification mei et al 2020 thus the rapid humification of sludge and retention of abundant beneficial components remain major challenges in sludge stabilization recently alkali thermal humification treatment aht has been widely applied to convert large volumes of sludge into value added products such as hydrochar biofuel fertilizer and humic acids ha in significant quantities gao et al 2021 lu et al 2020 according to tang et al 2022 aht is effective for nitrogen solubilization as well as organic nitrogen maintenance in sludge liquor 80 sludge liquor treated by aht at 120 c substantially improved crop yields compared to conventional fertilizer in addition yang et al 2019 proposed that aht can convert organic wastes into artificial ha through a combination of dehydration methylation reduction and condensation the roles of lignin and phenol are widely accepted to produce quinone like structures as key substances in the biochemical humification process tang et al 2022 however the mechanisms of ha formation in thermochemical processes during aht are still unclear fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms is an up and coming technique that has been successfully applied to accurately characterize the molecular composition and track the transformation pathways of dissolved organic matter dom in various complex environmental samples goranov et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 reported that ft icr ms can identify the most bioactive organic compounds in bio stabilized sludge including amino sugars carboxylic acids and indoleacetic acid molecular reaction network analysis has been used to predict possible precursor product pairs and outline the cascaded reactions of different compounds simon et al 2022 therefore understanding the molecular composition and transformation of dom based on ft icr ms and molecular reaction network analysis is crucial for optimizing the process hydrothermal humification process of sludge various soluble organic products in dom such as amino acids ha and indoleacetic acid exhibit various fertilizing effects on plants these substances are known as plant biostimulants which in small concentrations are efficient for enhancing nutrition efficiency and producing high yields and abiotic stress tolerance exogenous amino acids applied to plants can enhance the nitrogen use efficiency stimulating photosynthesis and upregulating nitrogen and carbon metabolisms du jardin 2012 organic acids play roles in providing redox equilibrium and supporting ionic gradients on membranes resulting in the acceleration of plant development and increasing yield igamberdiev and eprintsev 2016 morgunov et al 2017 ha induces an increase in plasma membrane h adenosine triphosphatase and stimulates the elongation of plant roots together with lateral root growth points canellas et al 2002 zandonadi et al 2007 in contrast individual organic toxic substances such as furfural phenol and 5 hydroxymethylfurfural formed in sludge are frequently observed at concentrations of up to several grams per liter depending on the process parameters reza et al 2016 therefore it is necessary to optimize the hydrothermal process conditions through a biological effect assessment improve the biological activity of sludge derived liquid products and control the generation of toxic by products this study was devoted to investigating the molecular transformation pathways and evaluating the bio availability of dom derived from sludge aht for producing a high quality ecological fertilizer briefly the main objectives of this study were to 1 investigate changes in the functional groups of dom under sludge aht using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps and ft icr ms in combination with network computational analysis was used to clarify

the molecular composition of dom in sludge aht products and plant effects in order to identify the main plant biostimulants this work is expected to provide a theoretical basis for process

was conducted to evaluate the relationship between molecular composition and plant effects using origin 2022 software the mantel test was conducted to determine the correlations between the environmental factors of dom and vital metabolic pathways 3 results and discussion 3 1 variation of dom composition in sludge aht the impacts of different alkali thermal times on sludge solubilization are reflected by changes in the concentration of soluble polysaccharide ps protein pn ha and melanoidin mrps as shown in fig 1 a the maximum concentration of ps was determined to be 718 18 mg l at dom1h which can be attributed to the alkaline environment causing the solubilization of insoluble macromolecular carbohydrates as well as the release of extracellular and intracellular polymeric substances via acidic groups dissociation tang et al 2022 the pn concentration subsequently increased and reached a maximum of 3260 56 mg l in dom12h but substantially declined to 2816 67 mg l in dom24h pn hydrolysates were transformed into small soluble fractions fig s2 where peptide bonds were disintegrated and oxidized to yield nh3 n and fatty acids along with bond formation deamination and ring opening reactions cho et al 2013 as for 3d eem the gradual enhancement of two peaks a tyrosine like proteins λex em 220 nm 310 nm and b tryptophan like proteins λex em 220 nm 340 nm also illustrated pn hydrolysis with the prolongation of aht time fig 1c the concentration of amino acids shown in fig 1b increased considerably proving that pn hydrolysis intensified and provided more core structures to form ha and facilitate the maillard reaction mr under superior alkaline conditions and core structures has were formed and polymerized in dom12h with an increase in the concentration of 94 5 than that in dom0h the more ha generated the more redox groups e g aldehyde ketone quinones were exposed further accelerating pn degradation and producing aromatic core structures for fresh ha formation meanwhile the two new peaks d and e appeared in 3d eem which are two types of aromatic substances phenol quinone structures in ha like components λex em 325 nm 400 nm and phenol quinone structures in fulvic acid like components λex em 230 nm 425 nm the peaks associated with ha components gradually shift to a longer wavelength λex em 475 376 nm implying that their structures develop a greater degree of aromaticity and polymerization with increasing aht time in addition the mrps concentration reached its highest level at dom24h 26 83 mmol l mprs and their by products with extremely poor bioactivity are generated from the aldol condensation of free amino groups zhang et al 2016 3 2 molecular transformation of dom in sludge under aht 3 2 1 characterization of dom functional groups during aht two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2d cos was employed to enhance the resolution of functional groups in dom and track their responsive sequence with aht time organic absorption bands in table s3 are interpretated as depicted in fig 2 a a synchronous correlation map shows six auto peaks on the diagonal and changes in band intensity followed the order 1660 1410 1595 1006 1134 835 cm 1 this observation indicates that the sequence of functional groups in the dom from 0 h to 24 h is 1 c o associated with proteins in amide ⅰ region coo of amino acids dos santos et al 2022 2 c oh c o possibly derived from polysaccharides o p o stretching associated with nucleic acids zhang et al 2020 and 3 ring vibrations from aromatic amino acids and esters lund and ray 2017 an asynchronous map fig 2b is able to discern the sequential order in which functional groups responded to an increase in reaction time the response sequence of peaks with increasing aht time is 1006 1660 1410 1134 835 1595 cm 1 this order suggested that c oh and c o c are affected first probably because of polysaccharide dehydration and depolymerization then c o and coo stretching vibration may be caused by pn hydrolysates producing amine aldehyde and reductone via the mr finally amine aldehyde and hydroxylamine condensations also result in the response of n h and c h vibrations which can be further synthesized into has and mrps xps was used to investigate the evolution of nitrogen functionalities in dom at varying aht time the n 1 s spectra are presented in fig 2c and the percentage of xps peak areas is shown in fig 2d five peaks are observed in the n 1 s spectrum inorganic n protein n pyridine n pyrrole n and quaternary n protein n is related to protein pyridine n and pyrrole n structures are derived from the decomposition products of nucleic acids and inorganic n is completely dissolved or hydrolyzed in the form of nh4 n no3 n wu et al 2020 fitting of spectra for dom0h n protein was found to be the dominant organic nitrogen source reflecting its greater potential value for extracting and recovering nitrogen from sludge inorganic n was mainly presented at the beginning of aht consistent with the quantitative determination of nitrogen contents in the dom fig s1 with increasing in aht time protein n shows a sharp decline from 85 to 34 whereas pyridine n and pyrrole n significantly increased by 15 and 12 respectively between 0 and 24 h this is because hydrothermal cracking produces protein n and amine n compounds whose intermediates are further converted to heterocyclic n compounds e g pyrazole pyridine pyrrole pyrazine by aromatization and polymerization reactions du et al 2022 a new functionality peak corresponding to quaternary n more stable heterocyclic n compounds is detected in the dom24h indicating that stable heterocyclic n functionality is generated by secondary cracking reactions of n containing intermediates tian et al 2013 furthermore the peak intensity of 1h nmr spectra in the har and hr o regions increases with increasing aht time because of the frequent condensation of hydroxylamine and amine aldehydes in the mr fig 2e suggesting that aht can enrich the aromatic oxygen containing functional groups in the dom and further improve the degree of humification gai et al 2015 3 2 2 molecular transformation of dom in sludge aht the relative abundance of four subcategories cho chon chop and others in different dom samples are compared in fig 3 a the proportion of chon compounds decreases by 20 at 0 1 h and increases by 28 at 1 3 h the significant decrease in the chon subcategory in dom1h can be attributed to a neutralization reaction between acidic groups in the intracellular polymeric substances and koh resulting in the generation of inorganic n table s2 the proportion of the top three categories is in the order of protein lignin crams like lipids fig 3b the compounds derived from lignin contain reducible groups conjugated with alkoxy or hydroxy substituted aromatics cram like compounds comprise most of the carbonyl containing species with aliphatic ketones and carboxyl groups yuan et al 2017 in combination with the structure and region humic like compounds may contribute to a significant proportion of the molecules in the lignin cram region h c 0 81 0 95 o c 0 54 0 56 it is likely that proteins and carbohydrates are continuously oxidized under aht and converted into aromatic n containing compounds as ha precursors thus it is evident that n containing compounds are the most active components in dom transformation the proportion of chon subgroups is calculated fig 3c fifteen subgroups n1 5o1 12 are identified with n1 3o5 8 molecules having comparatively high intensities mostly plotted in the lignin cram like structural region to clearly elucidate the changes occurring in each aht stage modified van krevelen vk diagrams were plotted to provide a visual representation by comparing precursors peaks removed resistants peak retained and products new peaks formulas fig 3d f among the removed compounds in stage ⅰ those with high h c and low o c values have higher aromaticity and lower polarity as a result of deoxygenation and dehydrogenation of proteins and amino sugars the newly formed chon compounds are distributed broadly in the h c range 1 0 2 0 and o c range 0 2 0 5 with lower values than those of the removed compounds in the vk plot fig 3d suggesting that more aromatic and less polar compounds are produced by aht these results show that some biodegradable compounds e g amino acid lipid carbohydrate participate in depolymerization oxidation and mr leading to an increase in carbonyl carboxyl amidogen and hydroxyl groups linked with aromatic ring at the beginning of aht asses et al 2018 meanwhile the number of molecules clearly changes in stage ⅰ removing 1421 molecules and producing 1374 new molecules whereas no significant changes occurs in stage ⅱ and ⅲ table 1 in stage ⅱ and ⅲ the terminal products have lower mw and higher aimod values fig s4 most of the identifiable products are heterocyclic n compounds such as pyrazine pyrrole and pyridine with hydrophobic and aromatic structures and poor biodegradability phungsai et al 2016 we have previously determined these by gc ms on hydrothermal liquid products of waste activated sludge wang et al 2021 to better understand dom transformation in sludge aht mass difference network analysis a practical approach to correlate the precursor and product pairs was employed on 24 reactions fig 4 a in stage ⅰ deamination is the dominant reaction nh conh h2 nh3 o etc accounting for 45 03 of the total reactions schmidt et al 2011 reported that terminal amino are easily transformed to carbonyl groups during the strecker deamination reaction nh3 o such a reaction shifts molecules to higher o c and lower h c ratios and many n containing compounds react by this pathway c10h18n2o5 c10h15n1o6 shown in fig 4b mr is the second most dominant reaction with the formation of fissile intermediates such as glyoxal c2h2o2 methylglyoxal c3h4o2 and diacetyl c4h6o2 then these intermediates as vital precursors are prone to aromatization and polymerization with amino acids like structures to generate unsaturated and aromatic compounds resembling humic substances in terms of some physicochemical properties fig 4c homoki farkas et al 1997 pieczonka et al 2021 in addition deoxygenation is also widely regarded as a crucial reaction the possible pathways of deoxygenation take three forms decarboxylation co2 dehydration h2o and decarbonylation co deoxygenation products correspond to different types of functional groups such as carbon dioxide for carboxylic acids carbon monoxide for ketones and aldehydes and water for alcohols hao et al 2021 the corresponding number of possible precursor product pairs based on adding two oxygen atoms was 163 2h 2o and 125 2o possessing the largest number of possible reactions in stage ⅱ an increase in o content alcohols aldehydes ketones and phenols mainly results from two important reactions during aht 1 ketonization amino acids and lipids hydrolysis significantly promote the formation of intermediates only cooh groups which can directly react with each other to produce ketones 2 hydroxylation reaction ketones and aldehydes from mrps and carbohydrates aldolization undergo addition reactions to form alcohols lehmann and kleber 2015 other possible reaction pairs are two α carbonyl aldehydes pyruvaldehyde c3h4o2 and 3 deoxyglucosone c6h10o5 which can form the typical humic like structures xps results show that sugar amine condensation is another reaction for synthesizing humic like structures whose intermediates are n heterocyclics that serve as precursors to humification in stage ⅲ decarbonization is accompanied by polymerization and aromatization resulting in low bioactive byproducts e g melanoidin humin in summary a cascade reaction with chronological sequences can be outlined starting with dom hydrolysis then deamination deoxygenation and decarboxylation cascaded and finally decarbonization fig 4c 3 3 evaluation of the effects of dom produced from sludge aht on plant 3 3 1 effect of dom on rice phenotypic parameter and key enzyme activity hydroponic experiments were conducted on rice seedlings and the root and shoot results are displayed in fig 5 the visual image clearly exhibits that almost all dom had a positive impact on root and shoot length when compared with control groups fig 5a but the degree of growth facilitation of roots and shoots is different rice seedlings exposed to dom1h showed the most favorable effect on root length fig 5b with increasing aht duration the stimulatory effects on root growth gradually weakened the growth of rice seedlings treated with dom24h was slightly inhibited and the root length was less than the average level by approximately 14 mm possibly due to the accumulation of n containing heterocycles and melanoidins that inhibit root elongation du et al 2022 the positive effect of shoot length is more evident with increasing aht time and dom12h is much more beneficial than the other dom solutions to further assess the feasibility of dom as an organic fertilizer the concentrations of h atpase and plant hormones were determined in rice seedlings fig 5d f rice seedlings treated with dom12h showed maximal indoleacetic acid iaa and h atpase concentrations because the presence of substantial plant biostimulants e g amino acids nucleotides and ha improves shoot elongation and abiotic stress alleviation in combination with phenotypic parameters and enzyme activities dom12h is considered the optimal condition for plant growth media during aht 3 3 2 effect of dom on transcriptomics of plants transcriptomic analysis was performed to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the growth stimulating effects of dom degs were determined in subjected to dom vs control fig s5 and subsequently mapped to the go and kegg databases fig s6 specifically the upregulated degs were most significantly enriched to protein processing followed by regulation of leaf development and response to organic substance these observations reveal that the expression of dges is sensitive to dom and can activate degs associated with specific biological functions e g protein maturation cell growth leaf development to regulate plant growth further as for kegg pathway a schematic diagram is provided in fig 6 g of the major metabolic pathways responding to dom in rice seedlings degs mapped to metabolic pathways occupy the largest proportion with phenylpropanoids biosynthesis and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites ranking second and third the gene expression levels of most enzymes related to starch and sucrose metabolism increased significantly p 0 05 compared to control samples hexokinase as a sensor for the glycolysis of d glucose and d fructose plays a dual role in regulating saccharide utilization and serving chen et al 2019 as rice seedlings were exposed to dom the levels of hexokinase increased continuously they showed a positive feedback effect on degs demonstrating that dom can significantly boost energy metabolism and carbohydrate storage in terms of enzymatic reactions of tricarboxylic acid cycle genes encoding enzymes were upregulated or unaffected when the rice cultivars were exposed to dom for instance α ketoglutaric acids linked with isocitrate and succinyl coa are capable of promoting the biosynthesis of l glutamate and show a higher activity in rice seedlings exposed to dom3h xiang et al 2021 phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathway is important for plant development and produces various metabolites including guaiacyl and syringyl lignin which are essential for cell wall biochemistry wu et al 2022 toxic substances e g pyrrole pyridine melanoid are produced in dom during the late alkali thermal period under stress from toxic substances rice seedlings modulate gene expression associated with lignin production to maintain cell stability some enzymes such as cinnamoyl coa reductase and peroxidase in the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway are down regulated especially in the presence of rice seedlings treated with dom12h and dom24h but the genes involved in the metabolites of another branch conifer aldehyde and coniferyl alcohol are mildly up regulated which may be due to metabolic flux redirection between the branches of the phenylpropanoid pathway to address high detrimental organic substances stress and maintain dynamic balance silva et al 2021 it can be concluded that toxic substances in dom activated cell walls formation to inhibit abiotic stimuli in rice seedlings by promoting the biosynthesis of phenylpropanoids 3 3 3 relationships between dom produced from sludge aht and biological effects to further reveal the main parameters responsible for plant growth pca was used to display multiple correlations between molecular composition and plant effects fig 6a the pca results showed that dom exhibits a significantly positive correlation with plant growth parameters shoot length biomass and enzyme activity are closely related to ps pn and has conversely n substituted aromatic compounds such as pyridine and pyrrole negatively correlated with plant growth parameters mantel tests were conducted to further analyze the exhibit relationships between dom attributes and vital degs pathways fig 6b notably the chemical composition of dom has significant effects on important metabolic pathways in plant nutrient uptake and growth the citrate cycle pathway ko00020 correlates significantly with dom fractions in particular amino acids and has can serve as important intermediates in the citrate cycle pathway to promote energy metabolism cell division and plant elongation however the accumulation of melanoidins restrains carbohydrate storage and decreases enzyme activity such as enolase and pyruvate kinase in the starch and sucrose metabolism pathway ko00010 of rice seedlings fig 5g 4 conclusions this work systematically investigated the molecular transformation and biological effects of dom in wastewater sludge at different aht times by ft icr ms in combination with molecular reaction network analysis and transcriptomics protein and lipid like compounds with larger mw and lower aimod were susceptible to continuous oxidation these were ultimately transformed into aromatic n containing compounds resembling humic substances in terms of some physicochemical properties molecular reaction network analysis revealed that deamination was the most frequent reaction and chon components had the highest reactivity during the entire aht process aht can effectively control toxic substances and enhance the production of plant biostimulants most of dom derived from aht showed significant growth facilitation in rice phenotypes and enzyme activities plant biostimulants including polysaccharides amino acids and has exhibited outstanding fertility performance in dom12h but melanoidins and n substituted aromatic compounds e g pyrrole pyridine melanoidin in dom24h are regarded as toxic substances that inhibit abiotic stimuli in rice seedlings dom12h was considered the optimal product for sludge hydrothermal humification and organic fertilizer recovery in the future long term field and potted experiments would be required to evaluate the sludge derived liquid

14914,understanding the composition transformation and bioactivity of dissolved organic matter dom at the molecular level is crucial for investigating the hydrothermal humification process of wastewater sludge and producing ecological fertilizers in this study dom transformation pathways under alkali thermal humification treatment aht were characterized by fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms in conjunction with molecular reaction network analysis the effects of dom on plant growth were examined using hydroponics and transcriptomic analysis in the wastewater sludge humification process aht produced maximum amounts of protein 3260 56 mg l and humic acid 5788 24 mg l after 12 h ft icr ms results indicated that protein like structures were prone to continuous oxidation and were ultimately transformed into aromatic n containing compounds resembling humic substances several reactive fragments such as c2h2o2 c3h4o2 and c4h6o2 formed by the maillard reaction mr were identified as potential precursors to humic acid ha in terms of biological effects dom12h showed the highest rice germination and growth activity whereas that produced by aht for a longer period 12 h displayed phytotoxicity owing to the accumulation of toxic substances plant biostimulants such as amino acids and has in dom improved energy metabolism and carbohydrate storage in rice seedlings by upregulating the starch and sucrose metabolism pathways toxic substances such as pyrrole pyridine and melanoidin in dom can activate cell walls formation to inhibit abiotic stimuli in rice seedlings through the biosynthesis of phenylpropanoid pathway these findings provide a theoretical basis for optimizing sludge hydrothermal humification and recovering high quality liquid fertilizers graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords dissolved organic matter hydrothermal humification treatment molecular reaction network rice seedling data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction sludge generated from wastewater biotreatment poses a series of critical problems owing to production volume high cost of treatment potential secondary environmental pollution and must undergo stabilized treatment before final disposal lu et al 2020 wang et al 2019 biotreatment is a popular method for sludge stabilization that converts putrescible organics such as proteins carbohydrates and lipids into humic substances kills pathogenic bacteria and recycles value added humic substances and methane rich biogas yang and antonietti 2020 aerobic composting and anaerobic digestion are mainstream technologies for sludge biological stabilization treatment hu et al 2022 however considering the long operating process complicated microbial response and nitrogen erosion it is still difficult to comply with the requirements for oriented conversion of humification mei et al 2020 thus the rapid humification of sludge and retention of abundant beneficial components remain major challenges in sludge stabilization recently alkali thermal humification treatment aht has been widely applied to convert large volumes of sludge into value added products such as hydrochar biofuel fertilizer and humic acids ha in significant quantities gao et al 2021 lu et al 2020 according to tang et al 2022 aht is effective for nitrogen solubilization as well as organic nitrogen maintenance in sludge liquor 80 sludge liquor treated by aht at 120 c substantially improved crop yields compared to conventional fertilizer in addition yang et al 2019 proposed that aht can convert organic wastes into artificial ha through a combination of dehydration methylation reduction and condensation the roles of lignin and phenol are widely accepted to produce quinone like structures as key substances in the biochemical humification process tang et al 2022 however the mechanisms of ha formation in thermochemical processes during aht are still unclear fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms is an up and coming technique that has been successfully applied to accurately characterize the molecular composition and track the transformation pathways of dissolved organic matter dom in various complex environmental samples goranov et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 reported that ft icr ms can identify the most bioactive organic compounds in bio stabilized sludge including amino sugars carboxylic acids and indoleacetic acid molecular reaction network analysis has been used to predict possible precursor product pairs and outline the cascaded reactions of different compounds simon et al 2022 therefore understanding the molecular composition and transformation of dom based on ft icr ms and molecular reaction network analysis is crucial for optimizing the process hydrothermal humification process of sludge various soluble organic products in dom such as amino acids ha and indoleacetic acid exhibit various fertilizing effects on plants these substances are known as plant biostimulants which in small concentrations are efficient for enhancing nutrition efficiency and producing high yields and abiotic stress tolerance exogenous amino acids applied to plants can enhance the nitrogen use efficiency stimulating photosynthesis and upregulating nitrogen and carbon metabolisms du jardin 2012 organic acids play roles in providing redox equilibrium and supporting ionic gradients on membranes resulting in the acceleration of plant development and increasing yield igamberdiev and eprintsev 2016 morgunov et al 2017 ha induces an increase in plasma membrane h adenosine triphosphatase and stimulates the elongation of plant roots together with lateral root growth points canellas et al 2002 zandonadi et al 2007 in contrast individual organic toxic substances such as furfural phenol and 5 hydroxymethylfurfural formed in sludge are frequently observed at concentrations of up to several grams per liter depending on the process parameters reza et al 2016 therefore it is necessary to optimize the hydrothermal process conditions through a biological effect assessment improve the biological activity of sludge derived liquid products and control the generation of toxic by products this study was devoted to investigating the molecular transformation pathways and evaluating the bio availability of dom derived from sludge aht for producing a high quality ecological fertilizer briefly the main objectives of this study were to 1 investigate changes in the functional groups of dom under sludge aht using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps and ft icr ms in combination with network computational analysis was used to clarify the transformation pathways of dom 2 reveal the plant effects and molecular biological mechanism of dom using hydroponic experiments and transcriptomic analysis 3 establish the relationships between the molecular composition of dom in sludge aht products and plant effects in order to identify the main plant biostimulants this work is expected to provide a theoretical basis for process optimization of sludge hydrothermal humification to produce high quality organic fertilizers 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater sludge and reagents raw sludge rs was collected from a municipal wastewater treatment plant in nanjing china the basic characteristics of rs are summarized in table s1 all analytical reagents were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd and guaranteed

in a 500 ml hydrothermal reactor yzpr 500 m yan zheng china containing a polytetrafluoroethylene container a batch of experiments was conducted with different alkali thermal times 0 0 3 1 3 6 12 and 24 h the hydrothermal temperature was selected at 170 c because it is the optimal temperature for improving the dewatering performance and obtaining the maximum amount of ha dwyer et al 2008 qiu et al

4500 hitachi japan a high performance liquid chromatography 1260 infinity ⅱ agilent usa equipped with a gel chromatography column 300 mm 8 mm shodex kw 802 5 was used to characterize the average molecular weight mw of dom the variations in the four mw fractions 0 1000 da 1000 3000 da 3000 5000 da and 5000 da are shown in fig s2 all dom samples were desalinated and concentrated using agilent bond elu ppl cartridges the purified samples were measured with ft icr ms solarix 15 0 t bruker germany equipped with an electrospray ionization interface all samples were ionized in the negative mode molecular formulas were assigned using matlab algorithms created by fu et al 2020 only those peaks with signal to noise ratios of 10 were considered during molecule assignment with the combination of

investigate the molecular transformation of dom the compounds were classified into three categories based on the ft icr ms results precursors resistants and products the classification steps were as follows first the accurate mw was calculated to six decimal places by the atomic mass certified by the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac for each element c h o n s and p second the coexisting formulas were identified from the samples before and after treatment third the abundance of the peak intensity of the coexisting formula was compared fc peak intensityafter intensitybefore the precursors are presented in samplebefore and disappeared in sampleafter as well as those compounds with fc 0 5 the resistants refer to those present in the specimens before and after treatment with 0 5 fc 2 0 and the products represent those that do not appear in samplebefore and are newly formed in sampleafter as well as those compounds with fc 2 0 hu et al 2022 finally the linkage analysis of possible precursor product pairs matched by the exact mass difference is listed in table s5 reaction pathway analysis based on the mass difference networks was performed using an established python code ft ms1 mdm and visualized by open access gephi software 0 9 4 2 4 effects of dom in sludge on plant growth 2 4 1 rice cultivation using dom liquid and enzyme activity determination plump rice seeds were sterilized for 30 min with 3 hydrogen peroxide and washed three times with deionized water dom used for hydroponic experiments was diluted to 20 mg toc l in the stock solution and the ph value was adjusted to 7 0 0 2 twenty treated seeds were placed in a petri dish 75 mm diameter on a filter paper moistened with deionized water at 25 c for 72 h in the dark then rice seedlings with similar root lengths were placed in hydroponic boxes containing 300 ml dom for 9 days day night 8 16 h finally all the rice seedlings were harvested and collected in a 80 c

different samples to understand the functions of degs go functional enrichment and kegg pathway analyses were performed using goatools https github com tanghaibao goatools and kobas http kobas cbi pku edu cn home do 2 5 data processing and statistical analysis all experiments were performed in triplicates and the results were reported as means standard deviations principal component analysis pca was conducted to evaluate the relationship between molecular composition and plant effects using origin 2022 software the mantel test was conducted to determine the correlations between the environmental factors of dom and vital metabolic pathways 3 results and discussion 3 1 variation of dom composition in sludge aht the impacts of different alkali thermal times on sludge solubilization are reflected by changes in the concentration of soluble polysaccharide ps protein pn ha and melanoidin mrps as shown in fig 1 a the maximum concentration of ps was determined to be 718 18 mg l at dom1h which can be attributed to the alkaline environment causing the solubilization of insoluble macromolecular carbohydrates as well as the release of extracellular and intracellular polymeric substances via acidic groups dissociation tang et al 2022 the pn concentration subsequently increased and reached a maximum of 3260 56 mg l in dom12h but substantially declined to 2816 67 mg l in dom24h pn hydrolysates were transformed into small soluble fractions fig s2 where peptide bonds were disintegrated and oxidized to yield nh3 n and fatty acids along with bond formation deamination and ring opening reactions cho et al 2013 as for 3d eem the gradual enhancement of two peaks a tyrosine like proteins λex em 220 nm 310 nm and b tryptophan like proteins λex em 220 nm 340 nm also illustrated pn hydrolysis with the prolongation of aht time fig 1c the concentration of amino acids shown in fig 1b increased considerably proving that pn hydrolysis intensified and provided more core structures to form ha and facilitate the maillard reaction mr under superior alkaline conditions and core structures has were formed and polymerized in dom12h with an increase in the concentration of 94 5 than that in dom0h the more ha generated the more redox groups e g aldehyde ketone quinones were exposed further accelerating pn degradation and producing aromatic core structures for fresh ha formation meanwhile the two new peaks d and e appeared in 3d eem which are two types of aromatic substances phenol quinone structures in ha like components λex em 325 nm 400 nm and phenol quinone structures in fulvic acid like components λex em 230 nm 425 nm the peaks associated with ha components gradually shift to a longer wavelength λex em 475 376 nm implying that their structures develop a greater degree of aromaticity and polymerization with increasing aht time in addition the mrps concentration reached its highest level at dom24h 26 83 mmol l mprs and their by products with extremely poor bioactivity are generated from the aldol condensation of free amino groups zhang et al 2016 3 2 molecular transformation of dom in sludge under aht 3 2 1 characterization of dom functional groups during aht two dimensional correlation spectroscopy 2d cos was employed to enhance the resolution of functional groups in dom and track their responsive sequence with aht time organic absorption bands in table s3 are interpretated as depicted in fig 2 a a synchronous correlation map shows six auto peaks on the diagonal and changes in band intensity followed the order 1660 1410 1595 1006 1134 835 cm 1 this observation indicates that the sequence of functional groups in the dom from 0 h to 24 h is 1 c o associated with proteins in amide ⅰ region coo of amino acids dos santos et al 2022 2 c oh c o possibly derived from polysaccharides o p o stretching associated with nucleic acids zhang et al 2020 and 3 ring vibrations from aromatic amino acids and esters lund and ray 2017 an asynchronous map fig 2b is able to discern the sequential order in which functional groups responded to an increase in reaction time the response sequence of peaks with increasing aht time is 1006 1660 1410 1134 835 1595 cm 1 this order suggested that c oh and c o c are affected first probably because of polysaccharide dehydration and depolymerization then c o and coo stretching vibration may be caused by pn hydrolysates producing amine aldehyde and reductone via the mr finally amine aldehyde and hydroxylamine condensations also result in the response of n h and c h vibrations which can be further synthesized into has and mrps xps was used to investigate the evolution of nitrogen functionalities in dom at varying aht time the n 1 s spectra are presented in fig 2c and the percentage of xps peak areas is shown in fig 2d five peaks are observed in the n 1 s spectrum inorganic n protein n pyridine n pyrrole n and quaternary n protein n is related to protein pyridine n and pyrrole n structures are derived from the decomposition products of nucleic acids and inorganic n is completely dissolved or hydrolyzed in the form of nh4 n no3 n wu et al 2020 fitting of spectra for dom0h n protein was found to be the dominant organic nitrogen source reflecting its greater potential value for extracting and recovering nitrogen from sludge inorganic n was mainly presented at the beginning of aht consistent with the quantitative determination of nitrogen contents in the dom fig s1 with increasing in aht time protein n shows a sharp decline from 85 to 34 whereas pyridine n and pyrrole n significantly increased by 15 and 12 respectively between 0 and 24 h this is because hydrothermal cracking produces protein n and amine n compounds whose intermediates are further converted to heterocyclic n compounds e g pyrazole pyridine pyrrole pyrazine by aromatization and polymerization reactions du et al 2022 a new functionality peak corresponding to quaternary n more stable heterocyclic n compounds is detected in the dom24h indicating that stable heterocyclic n functionality is generated by secondary cracking reactions of n containing intermediates tian et al 2013 furthermore the peak intensity of 1h nmr spectra in the har and hr o regions increases with increasing aht time because of the frequent condensation of hydroxylamine and amine aldehydes in the mr fig 2e suggesting that aht can enrich the aromatic oxygen containing functional groups in the dom and further improve the degree of humification gai et al 2015 3 2 2 molecular transformation of dom in sludge aht the relative abundance of four subcategories cho chon chop and others in different dom samples are compared in fig 3 a the proportion of chon compounds decreases by 20 at 0 1 h and increases by 28 at 1 3 h the significant decrease in the chon subcategory in dom1h can be attributed to a neutralization reaction between acidic groups in the intracellular polymeric substances and koh resulting in the generation of inorganic n table s2 the proportion of the top three categories is in the order of protein lignin crams like lipids fig 3b the compounds derived from lignin contain reducible groups conjugated with alkoxy or hydroxy substituted aromatics cram like compounds comprise most of the carbonyl containing species with aliphatic ketones and carboxyl groups yuan et al 2017 in combination with the structure and region humic like compounds may contribute to a significant proportion of the molecules in the lignin cram region h c 0 81 0 95 o c 0 54 0 56 it is likely that proteins and carbohydrates are continuously oxidized under aht and converted into aromatic n containing compounds as ha precursors thus it is evident that n containing compounds are the most active components in dom transformation the proportion of chon subgroups is calculated fig 3c fifteen subgroups n1 5o1 12 are identified with n1 3o5 8 molecules having comparatively high intensities mostly plotted in the lignin cram like structural region to clearly elucidate the changes occurring in each aht stage modified van krevelen vk diagrams were plotted to provide a visual representation by comparing precursors peaks removed resistants peak retained and products new peaks formulas fig 3d f among the removed compounds in stage ⅰ those with high h c and low o c values have higher aromaticity and lower polarity as a result of deoxygenation and dehydrogenation of proteins and amino sugars the newly formed chon compounds are distributed broadly in the h c range 1 0 2 0 and o c range 0 2 0 5 with lower values than those of the removed compounds in the vk plot fig 3d suggesting that more aromatic and less polar compounds are produced by aht these results show that some biodegradable compounds e g amino acid lipid carbohydrate participate in depolymerization oxidation and mr leading to an increase in carbonyl carboxyl amidogen and hydroxyl groups linked with aromatic ring at the beginning of aht asses et al 2018 meanwhile the number of molecules clearly changes in stage ⅰ removing 1421 molecules and producing 1374 new molecules whereas no significant changes occurs in stage ⅱ and ⅲ table 1 in stage ⅱ and ⅲ the terminal products have lower mw and higher aimod values fig s4 most of the identifiable products are heterocyclic n compounds such as pyrazine pyrrole and pyridine with hydrophobic and aromatic structures and poor biodegradability phungsai et al 2016 we have previously determined these by gc ms on hydrothermal liquid products of waste activated sludge wang et al 2021 to better understand dom transformation in sludge aht mass difference network analysis a practical approach to correlate the precursor and product pairs was employed on 24 reactions fig 4 a in stage ⅰ deamination is the dominant reaction nh conh h2 nh3 o etc accounting for 45 03 of the total reactions schmidt et al 2011 reported that terminal amino are easily transformed to carbonyl groups during the strecker deamination reaction nh3 o such a reaction shifts molecules to higher o c and lower h c ratios and many n containing compounds react by this pathway c10h18n2o5 c10h15n1o6 shown in fig 4b mr is the second most dominant reaction with the formation of fissile intermediates such as glyoxal c2h2o2 methylglyoxal c3h4o2 and diacetyl c4h6o2 then these intermediates as vital precursors are prone to aromatization and polymerization with amino acids like structures to generate unsaturated and aromatic compounds resembling humic substances in terms of some physicochemical properties fig 4c homoki farkas et al 1997 pieczonka et al 2021 in addition deoxygenation is also widely regarded as a crucial reaction the possible pathways of deoxygenation take three forms decarboxylation co2 dehydration h2o and decarbonylation co deoxygenation products correspond to different types of functional groups such as carbon dioxide for carboxylic acids carbon monoxide for ketones and aldehydes and water for alcohols hao et al 2021 the corresponding number of possible precursor product pairs based on adding two oxygen atoms was 163 2h 2o and 125 2o possessing the largest number of possible reactions in stage ⅱ an increase in o content alcohols aldehydes ketones and phenols mainly results from two important reactions during aht 1 ketonization amino acids and lipids hydrolysis significantly promote the formation of intermediates only cooh groups which can directly react with each other to produce ketones 2 hydroxylation reaction ketones and aldehydes from mrps and carbohydrates aldolization undergo addition reactions to form alcohols lehmann and kleber 2015 other possible reaction pairs are two α carbonyl aldehydes pyruvaldehyde c3h4o2 and 3 deoxyglucosone c6h10o5 which can form the typical humic like structures xps results show that sugar amine condensation is another reaction for synthesizing humic like structures whose intermediates are n heterocyclics that serve as precursors to humification in stage ⅲ decarbonization is accompanied by polymerization and aromatization resulting in low bioactive byproducts e g melanoidin humin in summary a cascade reaction with chronological sequences can be outlined starting with dom hydrolysis then deamination deoxygenation and decarboxylation cascaded and finally decarbonization fig 4c 3 3 evaluation of the effects of dom produced from sludge aht on plant 3 3 1 effect of dom on rice phenotypic parameter and key enzyme activity hydroponic experiments were conducted on rice seedlings and the root and shoot results are displayed in fig 5 the visual image clearly exhibits that almost all dom had a positive impact on root and shoot length when compared with control groups fig 5a but the degree of growth facilitation of roots and shoots is different rice seedlings exposed to dom1h showed the most favorable effect on root length fig 5b with increasing aht duration the stimulatory effects on root growth gradually weakened the growth of rice seedlings treated with dom24h was slightly inhibited and the root length was less than the average level by approximately 14 mm possibly due to the accumulation of n containing heterocycles and melanoidins that inhibit root elongation du et al 2022 the positive effect of shoot length is more evident with increasing aht time and dom12h is much more beneficial than the other dom solutions to further assess the feasibility of dom as an organic fertilizer the concentrations of h atpase and plant hormones were determined in rice seedlings fig 5d f rice seedlings treated with dom12h showed maximal indoleacetic acid iaa and h atpase concentrations because the presence of substantial plant biostimulants e g amino acids nucleotides and ha improves shoot elongation and abiotic stress alleviation in combination with phenotypic parameters and enzyme activities dom12h is considered the optimal condition for plant growth media during aht 3 3 2 effect of dom on transcriptomics of plants transcriptomic analysis was performed to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the growth stimulating effects of dom degs were determined in subjected to dom vs control fig s5 and subsequently mapped to the go and kegg databases fig s6 specifically the upregulated degs were most significantly enriched to protein processing followed by regulation of leaf development and response to organic substance these observations reveal that the expression of dges is sensitive to dom and can activate degs associated with specific biological functions e g protein maturation cell growth leaf development to regulate plant growth further as for kegg pathway a schematic diagram is provided in fig 6 g of the major metabolic pathways responding to dom in rice seedlings degs mapped to metabolic pathways occupy the largest proportion with phenylpropanoids biosynthesis and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites ranking second and third the gene expression levels of most enzymes related to starch and sucrose metabolism increased significantly p 0 05 compared to control samples hexokinase as a sensor for the glycolysis of d glucose and d fructose plays a dual role in regulating saccharide utilization and serving chen et al 2019 as rice seedlings were exposed to dom the levels of hexokinase increased continuously they showed a positive feedback effect on degs demonstrating that dom can significantly boost energy metabolism and carbohydrate storage in terms of enzymatic reactions of tricarboxylic acid cycle genes encoding enzymes were upregulated or unaffected when the rice cultivars were exposed to dom for instance α ketoglutaric acids linked with isocitrate and succinyl coa are capable of promoting the biosynthesis of l glutamate and show a higher activity in rice seedlings exposed to dom3h xiang et al 2021 phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathway is important for plant development and produces various metabolites including guaiacyl and syringyl lignin which are essential for cell wall biochemistry wu et al 2022 toxic substances e g pyrrole pyridine melanoid are produced in dom during the late alkali thermal period under stress from toxic substances rice seedlings modulate gene expression associated with lignin production to maintain cell stability some enzymes such as cinnamoyl coa reductase and peroxidase in the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway are down regulated especially in the presence of rice seedlings treated with dom12h and dom24h but the genes involved in the metabolites of another branch conifer aldehyde and coniferyl alcohol are mildly up regulated which may be due to metabolic flux redirection between the branches of the phenylpropanoid pathway to address high detrimental organic substances stress and maintain dynamic balance silva et al 2021 it can be concluded that toxic substances in dom activated cell walls formation to inhibit abiotic stimuli in rice seedlings by promoting the biosynthesis of phenylpropanoids 3 3 3 relationships between dom produced from sludge aht and biological effects to further reveal the main parameters responsible for plant growth pca was used to display multiple correlations between molecular composition and plant effects fig 6a the pca results showed that dom exhibits a significantly positive correlation with plant growth parameters shoot length biomass and enzyme activity are closely related to ps pn and has conversely n substituted aromatic compounds such as pyridine and pyrrole negatively correlated with plant growth parameters mantel tests were conducted to further analyze the exhibit relationships between dom attributes and vital degs pathways fig 6b notably the chemical composition of dom has significant effects on important metabolic pathways in plant nutrient uptake and growth the citrate cycle pathway ko00020 correlates significantly with dom fractions in particular amino acids and has can serve as important intermediates in the citrate cycle pathway to promote energy metabolism cell division and plant elongation however the accumulation of melanoidins restrains carbohydrate storage and decreases enzyme activity such as enolase and pyruvate kinase in the starch and sucrose metabolism pathway ko00010 of rice seedlings fig 5g 4 conclusions this work systematically investigated the molecular transformation and biological effects of dom in wastewater sludge at different aht times by ft icr ms in combination with molecular reaction network analysis and transcriptomics protein and lipid like compounds with larger mw and lower aimod were susceptible to continuous oxidation these were ultimately transformed into aromatic n containing compounds resembling humic substances in terms of some physicochemical properties molecular reaction network analysis revealed that deamination was the most frequent reaction and chon components had the highest reactivity during the entire aht process aht can effectively control toxic substances and enhance the production of plant biostimulants most of dom derived from aht showed significant growth facilitation in rice phenotypes and enzyme activities plant biostimulants including polysaccharides amino acids and has exhibited outstanding fertility performance in dom12h but melanoidins and n substituted aromatic compounds e g pyrrole pyridine melanoidin in dom24h are regarded as toxic substances that inhibit abiotic stimuli in rice seedlings dom12h was considered the optimal product for sludge hydrothermal humification and organic fertilizer recovery in the future long term field and potted experiments would be required to evaluate the sludge derived liquid
